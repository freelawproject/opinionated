He now appeals on several grounds. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>ISSUES</p>\n<p id=\"b180-4\">\u00b62 We restate Larson\u2019s issues as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">\u00b63 1. Whether the District Court correctly determined that there was</p>\n<p id=\"b180-6\">a particularized suspicion to conduct an investigatory stop of Larson\u2019s vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-7\">\u00b64 2. Whether the District Court correctly determined that there was a particularized suspicion to conduct field sobriety tests.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-8\">\u00b65 3. Whether Larson was entitled to <em>Miranda </em>warnings during the roadside DUI investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-9\">\u00b66 4. Whether the District Court committed reversible error in admitting opinion testimony from two law enforcement officers regarding the effect of marijuana on Larson\u2019s ability to drive safely.</p>\n<p id=\"AFBg\">\u00b67 5. Whether the District Court erred in refusing Larson\u2019s proposed jury instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-10\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b180-11\">\u00b68 Just after midnight on September 21, 2008, Sherriffs Deputy Scott King and Deputy Gordon Schmill were conducting a traffic stop just north of the intersection of South Avenue and Reserve Street. The deputies were in separate vehicles, and both had their respective light bars activated. Both had a clear, unimpeded view of the intersection just to the south.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-12\">\u00b69 During the course of the stop, the deputies became alerted to screeching tires at the nearby intersection. Both looked up to observe Larson\u2019s truck spin its tires, and cross the intersection with the engine continually revving. After checking to be sure that Schmill could finish the traffic stop alone, King proceeded to follow Larson down South Avenue. He noticed that Larson\u2019s truck had oversized tires and lacked mud flaps. Based upon this and his previous observations at the intersection, King activated his light bar and initiated a stop. In response, Larson made a wide turn onto a side street, causing part of his vehicle to cross into the oncoming traffic lane. He then pulled to the side of the road and parked.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-13\">\u00b610 Immediately upon contact, King observed that Larson slurred his words, spoke slowly, and had a delayed reaction time when asked for his license and registration. While King was checking for existing warrants on Larson and the passengers, Schmill arrived as backup. After King returned Larson\u2019s documentation, he inquired whether Larson had consumed any alcohol that evening. Larson answered that he had consumed alcohol earlier in the day. At that point, King requested Larson exit the vehicle to perform field sobriety tests. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>Larson\u2019s sub-par performance further confirmed King\u2019s suspicions of impairment, and he requested a breath sample. Larson agreed, was administered a portable breathalyzer test, and blew a .023.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-4\">\u00b611 Due to Larson\u2019s low score on the breath test, King became suspicious that Larson was impaired by something other than alcohol. He requested that Larson consent to a search of his vehicle. Larson consented, and then asked why. King explained his concern that Larson might be under the influence of drugs. In response, Larson turned, proceeded to his vehicle, and retrieved a bag of marijuana and a pipe. He subsequently admitted smoking marijuana an hour prior to the stop. King placed Larson under arrest for DUI. Subsequently, Larson refused a request to submit to a blood test.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">\u00b612 Prior to trial, Larson moved to suppress all evidence and statements made during the roadside investigation. He argued that King lacked a particularized suspicion to conduct a stop, lacked a particularized suspicion to justify field sobriety tests and <em>Miranda </em>warnings were required prior to his retrieval of the contraband and admission of smoking. The District Court determined that King had a particularized suspicion to conduct the initial traffic stop and that King\u2019s subsequent observations gave rise to a particularized suspicion justifying the DUI investigation. The District Court further determined that no <em>Miranda </em>warnings were necessary, because Larson\u2019s statements were voluntary and no interrogation had occurred. Additionally, the District Court determined that no search was implicated because Larson had voluntarily retrieved the marijuana.</p>\n<p id=\"A-q\">\u00b613 At trial, both King and Schmill offered testimony that Larson\u2019s driving was impaired by marijuana. Larson objected that the testimony constituted expert opinion testimony and neither deputy was qualified as an expert. Although the District Court agreed that neither was an expert, the deputies were permitted to testify as to their observations.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-6\">\u00b614 At the close of evidence, the District Court provided the jury with extensive instructions. At issue on appeal is the final instruction (rebuttable inference instruction):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-7\">If the person under arrest for driving under the influence of alcohol refused to submit to one or more tests for alcohol and/or drugs concentration, proof of refusal is admissible in any criminal action or proceedings arising out of the act alleged to have been committed while under the influence of alcohol and/or drugs. The trier of fact may infer from the refusal that the person was under the influence. The inference is rebuttable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b182-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>Larson submitted a proposed jury instruction to modify the District Court\u2019s rebuttable inference instruction. It was materially similar except that it contained a second paragraph that provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-4\">A test refusal does not, in itself, prove that the person was under the influence of alcohol or drugs at the time he was in control of a motor vehicle. A person may not be convicted based upon a refusal of a blood or breath test alone. The State must produce other competent evidence that the person was under the influence of alcohol or drugs while driving a motor vehicle. You must weigh the evidence presented and decide whether the State has proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the Defendant was under the influence of alcohol or drugs.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">Larson argued that his proposed instruction reflected the proper state of the law. The District Court declined to incorporate Larson\u2019s proposed instruction and instead went with the original rebuttable inference instruction. On May 12, 2009, the jury found Larson guilty of DUI. Larson appealed to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-6\">STANDARDS OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b182-7\">\u00b615 We review the denial of a motion to suppress evidence to determine whether the district court\u2019s findings of fact are clearly erroneous and whether the court correctly applied those findings as a matter of law. <em>State v. Cooper, </em>2010 MT 11, \u00b6 5, 355 Mont. 80, 224 P.3d 636. \u201c \u2018A trial court\u2019s findings are clearly erroneous if they are not supported by substantial credible evidence, if the court has misapprehended the effect of the evidence, or if our review of the record leaves us with a definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been made.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Deines, </em>2009 MT 179, \u00b6 6, 351 Mont. 1, 208 P.3d 857 (quoting <em>State v. Lewis, </em>2007 MT 295, \u00b6 17, 340 Mont. 10, 171 P.3d 731).</p>\n<p id=\"b182-8\">\u00b616 We review a court\u2019s evidentiary rulings to determine whether the court abused its discretion. <em>State v. Nobach, </em>2002 MT 91, \u00b6 13, 309 Mont. 342, 46 P.3d 618.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-9\">\u00b617 We review jury instructions in a criminal case to determine whether the district court abused its discretion. <em>State v. Swann, </em>2007 MT 126, \u00b6 32, 337 Mont. 326, 160 P.3d 511. A district court has broad discretion when it instructs a jury, but the instructions, as a whole, must fully and fairly instruct the jury on the law applicable to the case. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b183-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b183-4\">\u00b618 <em>Whether there was Particularized Suspicion to Conduct an Investigatory Stop of Larson\u2019s Automobile.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">\u00b619 Both the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution, and Article II, Section 11 of the Montana Constitution prohibit unreasonable searches and seizures. These protections apply to investigative stops of vehicles. <em>Cooper, </em>\u00b6 7. Montana law provides that \u201ca peace officer may stop any person or vehicle that is observed in circumstances that create a particularized suspicion that the person or occupant of the vehicle has committed, is committing, or is about to commit an offense.\u201d Section 46-5-401(1), MCA. The State bears the burden of proving that an officer had particularized suspicion to stop a vehicle by showing: (1) objective data and articulable facts from which an experienced officer can make certain inferences, and (2) a resulting suspicion that the occupant of a certain vehicle is or has been engaged in wrongdoing or was a witness to criminal activity. <em>Brown v. State, </em>2009 MT 64, \u00b6 20, 349 Mont. 408, 203 P.3d 842. Whether particularized suspicion exists is dependent upon a totality of the circumstances. <em>Cooper, </em>\u00b6 7. Consequently, particularized suspicion does not require certainty on the officer\u2019s part. <em>State v. Britt, </em>2005 MT 101, \u00b6 12, 327 Mont. 1, 111 P.3d 217.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">\u00b620 Larson analogizes his situation to <em>Grinde v. State, </em>249 Mont. 77, 813 P.2d 473 (1991). In <em>Grinde, </em>officers observed a vehicle lawfully drive down a street and turn the corner. <em>Grinde, </em>249 Mont. at 78, 813 P.2d at 474. Once the vehicle was out of sight, the officers heard tires squeal and an engine rev. <em>Id. </em>This Court ultimately determined that particularized suspicion was lacking because the officers\u2019 personal observations were limited to nothing more than a car operating in a \u201csafe and prudent manner.\u201d <em>Grinde, </em>249 Mont. at 80, 813 P.2d at 475. \u00b621 Unlike the officers in <em>Grinde, </em>King\u2019s personal observations supported a particularized suspicion of Larson. King was present when the tires first screeched, he watched the truck rev continuously while crossing the intersection, and he observed the oversized tires without mud flaps, a potential violation of \u00a7 61-9-407, MCA. Moreover, the driver of the truck opted to engage in this conduct despite being in full view of two officers on the street, and two patrol cars, both of which had their light bars activated.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-7\">\u00b622 Larson further argues that the State cannot rely on the potential mud flap violation because the District Court did not find Larson actually violated the statute. However, King did not need to be certain of a mud flap violation for the purposes of particularized suspicion. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number><em>Britt, </em>\u00b6 12. The potential mud flap violation was merely one observation King relied upon in determining that a particularized suspicion existed to conduct a traffic stop.</p>\n<p id=\"Aro\">\u00b623  The District Court correctly concluded that King had particularized suspicion to stop Larson\u2019s truck. Larson screeched his tires and revved his engine continually, while crossing a busy intersection. He did this in plain view of two officers who already had the light bars of their vehicles activated. King subsequently observed that Larson\u2019s truck had a potential mud flap violation. These, when taken together with rational inferences, reasonably warranted the stop.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">\u00b624 <em>Whether there was Particularized Suspicion to Conduct Field Sobriety Tests of Larson.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b184-6\">\u00b625 Field sobriety tests constitute a search under both the United States Constitution and the Montana Constitution. <em>Hulse v. DOJ, Motor Vehicle Div., </em>1998 MT 108, \u00b6 38, 289 Mont. 1, 961 P.2d 75; U.S. Const. Amend. IV; Mont. Const, art. II, \u00a711. Accordingly, field sobriety tests require particularized suspicion that a driver is impaired. <em>Hulse, </em>\u00b6 38. To establish particularized suspicion for field sobriety tests, a peace officer need not rely solely on the facts supporting the investigative stop. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 40. A lawful stop can escalate based upon an officer\u2019s subsequent observations. <em>Id. </em>However, the investigation must still remain, \u201cwithin the limits created by the facts upon which the stop is predicated and the suspicion which they arouse.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b184-7\">\u00b626  Here, the investigation took on an escalating quality, because Larson\u2019s post-stop conduct indicated impairment. Before pulling over, Larson made a wide turn onto a side street, causing his truck to cross into the oncoming traffic lane. Upon contact, Larson exhibited slow, slurred speech and had a delayed reaction time. Moreover, Larson admitted that he had been drinking earlier in the day. King made these observations between the time he initiated the stop of the truck and the time he returned Larson\u2019s identification. Considering all of these facts together, in the totality of the circumstances the District Court correctly concluded that King had a particularized suspicion that Larson was impaired, and field sobriety tests were justified.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-8\">\u00b627 <em>Whether Larson was Entitled to Miranda Warnings During the Roadside DUI Investigation.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b184-9\">\u00b628 \u2018The Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Article II, Section 25 of the Montana Constitution provide that no person shall be compelled, in any criminal case, to be a witness against himself.\u201d <em>State v. Olson, </em>2003 MT 61, \u00b6 13, 314 Mont. 402, 66 P.3d 297. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>I \u2018The prosecution may not use statements that stem from a custodial interrogation of a defendant unless the defendant is warned, prior to the questioning, that he has a right to remain silent, that any statement he does make may be used as evidence against him, and that he has a right to the presence of an attorney.\u201d <em>Olson, </em>\u00b6 13 (citing <em>Miranda v. Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 444, 86 S. Ct. 1602, 1612 (1966)). These warnings have become commonly known as the <em>Miranda </em>warnings. <em>Olson, </em>\u00b6 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-4\">\u00b629 Larson argues that he should have received <em>Miranda </em>warnings either during the roadside DUI investigation, or after the portable breath test showed he was under the legal limit for alcohol I impairment. He contends that the length of his roadside detention exceeded the scope of the investigation and subjected him to a custodial interrogation. Furthermore, he implicitly argues that King\u2019s request for consent to search necessitated <em>Miranda </em>warnings. The I State responds that the investigation was analogous to a Terry stop, and <em>Miranda </em>warnings were not required.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">\u00b630 This Court recognizes that \u201c Taw enforcement officers need not administer <em>Miranda </em>warnings to suspects during brief investigative encounters even if those encounters are somewhat coercive.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Hurlbert, </em>2009 MT 221, \u00b6 34, 351 Mont. 316, 211 P.3d 869 (quoting <em>State v. Elison, </em>2000 MT 288, \u00b6 27, 302 Mont. 228, 14 P.3d 456). TS]tatements made by a defendant in response to an officer\u2019s roadside questioning [do] not require warnings of constitutional rights because of the brevity of questioning and its public setting, even though few motorists would feel free to leave.\u201d <em>Elison, </em>\u00b6 29 (citing <em>Berkemer v. McCarty, </em>468 U.S. 420, 436-39, 104 S. Ct. 3138, 3148-49). We have analogized such roadside encounters to \u2018Terry stops,\u2019\u2019where an officer may ask questions, but the detainee is under no obligation to respond. <em>State v. Allen, </em>1998 MT 293, \u00b6 11, 292 Mont. 1, 970 P.2d 81. Furthermore, a request for field sobriety tests, without interrogation, does not subject a detainee to a custodial interrogation. <em>State v. Stanczak, </em>2010 MT 106, \u00b6 9, 356 Mont. 263, 232 P.3d 896 (citing <em>State v. Van Kirk, </em>2001 MT 184, \u00b6 22, 306 Mont. 215, 32 P.3d 735).</p>\n<p id=\"b185-7\">\u00b631  Larson was not entitled to <em>Miranda </em>warnings during the roadside DUI investigation. Larson analogizes his situation to <em>State v. Elison, </em>arguing that detentions lasting more than five to ten minutes are unreasonable. However, <em>Elison </em>merely affirmed our prior conclusions that roadside investigations are not custodial interrogations so long as officers keep the scope of an inquiry reasonably related to the purpose for which the investigation was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>initiated. <em>Elison, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 31-33. Moreover, we have explicitly declined to define specific time parameters for roadside investigatory stops, because reasonableness is dependent upon specific circumstances. <em>State v. Nelson, </em>2004 MT 310, \u00b6 23, 323 Mont. 510, 101 P.3d 261 (24-minute DUI investigation, including field sobriety tests and arrest, was reasonable); <em>State v. Sharp, </em>217 Mont. 40, 47, 702 P.2d 959, 963 (1985) (\u2018Drawing artificial distinctions or \u2018time lines\u2019 in situations such as these does not comport with reality or common sense.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b186-4\">\u00b632 Larson\u2019s roadside detainment remained public, routine and temporary in nature, never exceeding the scope of a DUI investigation. <em>Allen, </em>\u00b6 13. Larson\u2019s initial conduct and responses to King\u2019s questions justified field sobriety tests. The record reflects that Larson was not interrogated while performing those tests. When King did ask questions, they were confined to the context of an ongoing DUI investigation. <em>Elison, </em>\u00b6 32 (\u201can officer may ask the detainee a moderate number of questions to determine the detainee\u2019s identity and to try to obtain information confirming or dispelling the officer\u2019s suspicions before the requirements of <em>Miranda </em>attach\u2019!). Furthermore, Larson extended his roadside detention by volunteering to take a portable breath test.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">\u00b633 We disagree with Larson\u2019s contention that his breath test results ended the investigation and subjected him to <em>de facto </em>custody. This is the type of artificial distinction we have declined in the past. <em>Sharp, </em>217 Mont. at 47, 702 P.2d at 963. The record reflects that subsequent to the breath test, Kang remained concerned about Larson\u2019s ability to drive. As a result, King made brief, reasonable, inquiries about drugs as potential sources of impairment. <em>State v. Seaman, </em>2005 MT 307, \u00b6 29, 329 Mont. 429, 124 P.3d 1137 (\u2018for law enforcement officers to effectively discharge their duties, they must be given some latitude to react to and follow up on their observations\u2019!). Despite King\u2019s change of focus following the breath test, nothing distinguishes this situation from previous traffic stops. <em>Allen, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 12-14; <em>Elison, </em>\u00b6 33. Based on the foregoing, we determine Larson\u2019s roadside detainment was a reasonable DUI investigation, and no <em>Miranda </em>warnings were required.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-6\">\u00b634  Furthermore, Larson fails to demonstrate that the District Court erred in finding his conduct voluntary. The entire roadside interaction between Larson and the officers was devoid of indications of involuntariness we have considered in the past. Larson does not offer evidence that King employed violence, threats, or made direct or implied promises. <em>State v. Scarborough, </em>2000 MT 301, \u00b6 32, 302 Mont. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>350, 14 P.3d 1202. Moreover, there is no indication that Larson was lied to or subjected to any condemned police practice. <em>State v. Phelps, </em>215 Mont. 217, 224-25, 696 P.2d 447, 451 (1985). On the contrary, counsel for Larson actively elicited testimony highlighting Larson\u2019s cooperativeness with the investigation. Thus, we conclude that the District Court did not err when it found Larson\u2019s retrieval of the marijuana and admission that he had smoked it, entirely voluntary.</p>\n<p id=\"AcV\">\u00b635 Finally, we note that King\u2019s request for consent to search did not implicate Larson\u2019s right against self-incrimination. \u2018Consent to a search is not an incriminating statement; it is not testimonial or communicative in nature, thus it is not protected by the Fifth Amendment.\u201d <em>Hurlbert, </em>\u00b6 35 (citing <em>U.S. v. Lemon, </em>550 F.2d 467, 472 (9th Cir. 1977)). Furthermore, the District Court correctly concluded that no search was at issue, because Larson personally retrieved the marijuana and pipe after being asked for consent to search. <em>State v. Graves, </em>191 Mont. 81, 90, 622 P.2d 203, 208 (1981), overruled in part by <em>State v. Daniels, </em>210 Mont. 1, 16, 682 P.2d 173, 181 (1984) (no search where officer asked about defendant\u2019s use of a knife and defendant immediately handed the officer a knife).</p>\n<p id=\"b187-4\">\u00b636 <em>Whether the District Committed Reversible Error in Admitting Opinion Testimony from Deputies King and Schmill Regarding the Effect of Marijuana on Larson\u2019s Ability to Drive Safely.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">\u00b637 As a threshold matter, Larson posits that \u2018The District Court Erred by Denying Larson\u2019s Motion to Dismiss for Lack of Competent Corroborating Evidence of Driving While Impaired by Marijuana,\u2019\u2019but provides no support for this position. Instead, his ensuing discussion focuses on whether the District Court abused its discretion by allowing the deputies to offer opinion testimony on marijuana impairment. This Court neither considers unsupported issues nor undertakes the obligation to formulate arguments for a party on appeal. <em>State v. Miller, </em>2008 MT 106, \u00b6 15, 342 Mont. 355, 181 P.3d 625. As a result, we will only address Larson\u2019s evidentiary contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-6\">\u00b638 The Montana Rules of Evidence allow for the admission of both lay opinion and expert opinion testimony. Lay witness testimony is permitted for opinions or inferences rationally based on the perception of the witness and helpful to a clear understanding of the witness\u2019 testimony or the determination of a fact in issue. M. R. Evid. 701. Expert opinion testimony is admissible on issues of \u201cscientific, technical or other specialized knowledge,\u201d so long as two requirements are met: (1) the opinion will assist the trier of fact in understanding the evidence or determining a fact in issue, and (2) the witness is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>qualified as an expert through knowledge, skill, experience, training or education. M. R. Evid. 702. We first turn to the issue of whether the testimony given by deputies King and Schmill was lay or expert opinion testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-4\">\n<em>a. Lay or Expert Opinion Testimony</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"Alg\">\u00b639 We have held that opinion testimony regarding a defendant\u2019s ability to drive safely due to drug consumption is expert opinion testimony requiring a foundation under M. R. Evid. 702. <em>Nobach, </em>\u00b6 22. In <em>State v. Nobach, </em>we reasoned that lay persons are not \u201csufficiently knowledgeable about common symptoms of drug consumption, much less the effects of drug consumption on a person\u2019s ability to drive a motor vehicle safely, to offer lay opinion testimony on those subjects, based upon personal observations.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 17. Moreover, we analogized such testimony to opinions offered regarding the horizontal gaze nystagmus test and found a similar need for proper foundation based upon training or education. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">\u00b640 At trial, Schmill and King each gave opinion testimony regarding Larson\u2019s ability to drive safely due to marijuana impairment. On direct, King\u2019s relevant testimony was:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-6\">[King]: Okay. Starting with the-the pealing out through the intersection, aggressive driving, through the wide turn before he came to the stop, passing over in the oncoming traffic lane there, the slowed and slurred speech and reactions, the-the poor performance of the standardized field sobriety tests, maneuvers, and then the admission, and then of course him producing the bag of marijuana and the pipe, there was no doubt in my mind that his impairment was due to being under the influence of marijuana.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-7\">[County Attorney]: So based on all of those observations during your interaction with the defendant, do you have an opinion as to whether he was impaired?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-8\">[King]: I do.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-9\">[County Attorney]: And what is that opinion?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-10\">[King]: That he was impaired by marijuana.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b188-11\">Schmill offered his opinion regarding the effects of marijuana impairment on driving:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-12\">[County Attorney]: Okay. And based on your training and experience, if someone is impaired by marijuana, are they able to have all of their attention on all of the different things that they need to at the time to be a safe driver?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-13\">[Schmill]: No. I don\u2019t believe so.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b189-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>Schmill also opined that Larson\u2019s driving was impaired due to marijuana:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b189-4\">[County Attorney]: And based on your observations that night and the observations that Deputy King told you he made, putting all the pieces of the puzzle together that night, did you feel the defendant was impaired by marijuana?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b189-5\">[Schmill]: I do.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b189-6\">Based upon the foregoing, it is clear that both deputies provided opinion testimony regarding Larson\u2019s ability to drive safely as a result of consuming marijuana.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-7\">\u00b641  The State attempts to distinguish <em>Nobach, </em>arguing that the holding was limited to prescription drugs in a non-DUI context. However, such a narrow distinction is not in accord with the reasoning behind <em>Nobach. </em>Time may come where the average lay person will be able to opine as to the effects of marijuana consumption on motor vehicle operation, but for now the reasoning of <em>Nobach </em>is sound. We conclude the deputies\u2019 opinions that Larson\u2019s driving was impaired due to marijuana consumption were expert opinions that required adequate foundation under M. R. Evid. 702.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AhE\">\n<em>b. Foundation</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b189-8\">\u00b642  Larson argues that the District Court determined that Schmill and King were not experts and, as a result, there was no foundation for their opinions regarding whether Larson\u2019s driving ability was impaired by marijuana. The State counters that there was sufficient foundation laid concerning the officers\u2019 training and experience in discerning the effects of marijuana impairment on the ability to drive safely. We conclude that there was inadequate foundation for the deputies\u2019 opinions regarding Larson\u2019s ability to drive safely based upon marijuana impairment.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-9\">\u00b643 Montana Rules of Evidence 702 requires foundation that the expert has adequate knowledge, skill, experience, training or education upon which to base an opinion. <em>State v. Stout, </em>2010 MT 137, \u00b6 59, 356 Mont. 468, 237 P.3d 37. The witness must demonstrate specialized knowledge which distinguishes him or her from a lay person. <em>Id. </em>In <em>State v. Gregeroff, </em>287 Mont. 1, 951 P.2d 578 (1997), we found a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>sufficient foundation had been laid for expert testimony regarding accident causation, because the witness was an eight- year law enforcement veteran, had attended two-week investigation courses, had taught courses on accident investigation to other academies, and had specialized DUI training. <em>Gregeroff, </em>287 Mont. at 4, 951 P.2d at 580. On the other hand, in <em>Nobach, </em>we found insufficient foundation for expert opinion regarding the ability to drive under drug impairment, because the officer only had three days of academy drug training, and no training or experience with the specific type of prescription drugs. <em>Nobach, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 25-26.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-4\">\u00b644 There was inadequate foundation to admit King\u2019s expert opinion that Larson\u2019s ability to drive was impaired by marijuana. King described his duties as crime control, investigation, traffic control and general patrol. He testified that he was not a Drug Recognition Expert as approved by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. Furthermore, King testified to limited drug training:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-5\">[County Attorney]: Okay. And can you tell me what training you\u2019ve received as far as the detection of drugs goes?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-6\">[King]: Also during the academy, we were given a drug recognition course. I don\u2019t recall how long it is or the amount of time that we spend on that subject.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-7\">[County Attorney]: Okay. During that course do you learn what some of the factors are regarding marijuana impairment?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-8\">[King]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-9\">[Defense Counsel]: Can you show me where in this manual, which is the NHTSA manual you\u2019ve admitted you\u2019ve been tested on, where peeling out is an indicator of impairment due to marijuana.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AYV\">[King]: It\u2019s not in the manual.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-10\">[Defense Counsel]: Can you show me where a wide turn is an indicator due to marijuana?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-11\">[King]: This reference is for sobriety for alcohol.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-12\">[Defense Counsel]: Which is in fact all the training you\u2019ve had.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ACE\">[King]: Correct. Minus a small class during the academy on the recognition of drugs.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b190-13\">\u00b645 With regard to his experience, King testified that he had never before done a DUI-drug investigation as a solo officer. Although King testified to prior involvement in marijuana arrests, he had no experience with impaired driving due to marijuana consumption. Moreover, although Kang testified to learning some of the indicators of marijuana impairment during training, he failed to identify any. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>Without more, King could not qualify as an expert for the purposes of M. R. Evid. 702.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-4\">\u00b646 Likewise, there was improper foundation to admit Schmill\u2019s expert opinion that Larson\u2019s driving was impaired due to marijuana. Like King, Schmill was not a Drug Recognition Expert approved by the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration. Schmill did have slightly more training than King:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-5\">[County Attorney]: Did you receive any specialized training in the field of DUI detection or investigation?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-6\">[Schmill]: I did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-7\">[County Attorney]: Could you describe that training?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-8\">[Schmill]: One of those trainings involved eight hours of training with the Missoula Police Department and detection of alcohol and drug for DUIs and just drugs in general.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-9\">[County Attorney]: And what did you learn about the detection of marijuana during this training?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-10\">[Schmill]: The training I learned was that the detection of marijuana is something similar to someone who\u2019s been impaired by alcohol and-and that is I\u2019ve learned that if you\u2019re impaired by a certain type of drugs, some drugs you have what they call a horizontal gaze nystagmus, HGN, and some does not. I\u2019ve learned that some drugs will react you\u2019ll have three indicators for the walk-and-turn. You'll-it will-it will have indicators for that. You'll have indicators for the one-leg stand. Some of the-some of the other indicators: you'll have bloodshot, glassy eyes; your movement\u2019s slow; you know, slurred speech. Stuff-something similar to someone who is impaired by alcohol.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b191-11\">However, on cross-examination, Schmill\u2019s testimony demonstrated shortfalls in his training:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-12\">[Defense Counsel]: And you\u2019re of course aware that NHTSA doesn\u2019t recognize any of the field sobriety tests as indicative of impairment due to marijuana.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-13\">[Schmill]: Not that I know of. I don\u2019t know.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-14\">[Defense Counsel]: And-well, you\u2019ve been trained at the academy-</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-15\">[Schmill]: Right. For alcohol.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-16\">[Defense Counsel]: -pursuant to NHTSA standards.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-17\">[Schmill]: Uh-huh.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-18\">[Defense Counsel]: And nowhere in that training were you told that any of those field sobriety scores could be indicative of impairment due to another drug or marijuana.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>[Schmill]: Not to my recollection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-4\">[Defense Counsel]: So you can\u2019t tell me how marijuana impairs an individual absent this correlation you were taught at this class.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ale\">[Schmill]: Nope.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-5\">[Defense Counsel]: You can\u2019t tell me any sort of driving cues that you might observe.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-6\">[Schmill]: They didn\u2019t give us anything like if they\u2019re going to drive wrong or whatever.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-7\">[Defense Counsel]: Sure. Well, there\u2019s-there\u2019s 20 driving cues that you might observe when somebody\u2019s under the influence of. You weren\u2019t given anything like that for marijuana.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-8\">[Schmill]: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-9\">[Defense Counsel]: You weren\u2019t given any sort of field sobriety tests that can be used to determine whether somebody is at a certain marijuana blood content or-</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-10\">[Schmill]: No. Just that they\u2019d be similar to yourdike your one-leg stand and your walk-and-turn.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b192-11\">\u00b647 Schmill also testified to a lack of field experience dealing with marijuana impairment. He acknowledged being involved in only five or six marijuana cases and confirmed that in three of them, an outside drug recognition expert had been called in to make impairment determinations. Furthermore, he conceded that he could not distinguish between burnt and raw marijuana.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-12\">\u00b648  We hold that the foundation regarding King and Schmill\u2019s training and experience was insufficient to demonstrate the special training or education, and adequate knowledge upon which to base an expert opinion as required by M. R. Evid. 702. Their respective trainings involved only brief exposure to recognition of drug impairment. Each demonstrated uncertainty in identifying specific indications of marijuana impairment. Moreover, Schmill compared marijuana impairment to alcohol impairment, but testified that that he had no basis for doing so. The two deputies pointed to few practical field experiences dealing with marijuana, let alone interactions with drivers impaired by marijuana. As a result, it was error on the part of the District Court to admit the deputies\u2019 expert opinions regarding Larson\u2019s ability to drive due to marijuana impairment.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-13\">c. <em>Whether the Error was Prejudicial</em></p>\n<p id=\"Ano\">\u00b649 We now turn to the issue of whether the District Court\u2019s error in admitting the deputies\u2019 expert testimony was prejudicial, i.e., not harmless, to Larson. This Court utilizes a two-step analysis to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>determine whether error was prejudicial to a criminal defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial and mandates reversal. <em>Van Kirk, </em>\u00b6 37. First, we inquire whether the error is \u201cstructural\u201d error or \u201ctrial\u201d error. <em>Id. </em>Structural error is error that \u201caffects the framework within which a trial proceeds; it typically is of constitutional dimension, precedes the trial, and undermines the fairness of the entire trial proceeding.\u201d <em>Nobach, </em>\u00b6 27. Examples include errors injury selection, deprivation of the right to counsel, and lack of an impartial judge. <em>Van Kirk, </em>\u00b6 39. If the error was structural, the inquiry ends and the verdict reversed. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 41. On the other hand, if the error is trial error, we proceed to the second step and inquire whether the error was prejudicial. <em>Id. </em>Trial error typically occurs during presentation of the case, and includes improper admission of evidence. <em>Nobach, </em>\u00b6 27.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-4\">\u00b650 Based upon the foregoing, the erroneous admission of the deputies\u2019 expert opinions during trial constituted trial error. We assess trial error under our harmless error statute, \u00a746-20-701(1), MCA, in order to determine the prejudicial impact with regard to the other evidence produced at trial. <em>Van Kirk, </em>\u00b6 40. To do this, we utilize the \u201ccumulative evidence\u201d test. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 43. Under this test, the State must show that the jury was presented with \u201cadmissible evidence that proved the same facts as the tainted evidence and, qualitatively, by comparison, the tainted evidence would not have contributed to the conviction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 47.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">\u00b651 The expert opinions were offered as proof that Larson\u2019s driving was impaired by marijuana. Thus, to satisfy the \u201ccumulative evidence\u201d test the State must meet two requirements. First, the State must point to other admissible evidence demonstrating that Larson\u2019s ability to operate his truck was impaired by marijuana. Second, the State must demonstrate that qualitatively, no reasonable possibility exists that the erroneously- admitted opinions might have contributed to Larson\u2019s conviction. We conclude that the State has satisfied both requirements. \u00b652 First, the State has shown other admissible evidence demonstrating that Larson\u2019s ability to operate his vehicle safely was impaired by marijuana. The deputies\u2019 non-expert testimony provided the jury with observations of Larson\u2019s impairment. Both King and Schmill testified to Larson\u2019s clear lack of judgment when he screeched the truck\u2019s tires and revved the engine, in plain sight of two officers and two patrol vehicles with activated light bars. King testified to Larson\u2019s wide turn into the oncoming lane, his slow and slurred speech, and delayed reaction time. Larson told King he had consumed alcohol earlier in the day, and his performance on the field sobriety <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>tests indicated impairment. Based upon these facts, the jury certainly could have concluded Larson\u2019s driving was impaired. Additionally, the jury was presented with admissible evidence that Larson\u2019s impairment was due to marijuana. Larson voluntarily produced a bag of marijuana and a pipe, and admitted that he had smoked an hour earlier. Furthermore, Schmill testified to an odor of marijuana and Larson\u2019s bloodshot, glassy eyes. Thus, the jury was presented with other admissible evidence that allowed it to conclude Larson\u2019s driving was impaired by marijuana.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-4\">\u00b653  Second, in comparison to the admissible evidence, there is no reasonable possibility that the erroneously-admitted expert testimony contributed to Larson\u2019s conviction. Each deputy clearly conveyed his respective lack of familiarity with marijuana. The jury heard each admit to a deficiency in training and experience with regard to marijuana impairment. On cross-examination, Larson demonstrated that neither deputy was qualified to offer opinions regarding marijuana\u2019s impact on the ability to drive. We conclude that the erroneously-admitted expert opinions were harmless and did not prejudice Larson\u2019s right to a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">\u00b654 <em>Whether the District Court Properly Refused Larson\u2019s Proposed Jury Instruction.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b194-6\">\u00b655 Larson argues that the District Court\u2019s rebuttable inference jury instruction failed to accurately state the law, because it did not explain that the State had a burden of proof beyond the rebuttable inference. He argues that in the absence of such an instruction, a jury does not know how to construe the word \"rebuttable,\u201d and is permitted to convict a defendant solely on the basis of the rebuttable inference. Furthermore, Larson posits that that this issue was not raised in, and is not controlled by, either <em>State v. Michaud, </em>2008 MT 88, 342 Mont. 244, 180 P.3d 636, or <em>Great Falls v. Morris, </em>2006 MT 93, 332 Mont. 85, 134 P.3d 692. The State responds that the jury instructions, as a whole, properly advised the jury as to the State\u2019s burden of proof and explained how the jury was permitted to consider Larson\u2019s refusal to submit to a blood test.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-7\">\u00b656 Section 61-8-404, MCA, governs the admissibility of, and weight given to, evidence in a DUI trial. We have previously interpreted this statute to demand competent corroborating evidence of impairment, beyond drug test results or a defendant\u2019s refusal to submit to a drug test. <em>Morris, </em>\u00b6 21; <em>Michaud, </em>\u00b6 49. Larson posits that our prior decisions mandate an explicit jury instruction that explains the State\u2019s burden to provide competent corroborating evidence. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>\u00b657 In <em>State v. Miller, </em>we were faced with the issue of whether a district court abused its discretion by failing to explicitly tell the jury that the State needed to provide competent corroborating evidence other than the rebuttable inference. <em>Miller, </em>\u00b6 17. The specific jury instruction at issue in <em>Miller </em>provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b195-4\">If a person refuses to submit to a physical test or a test of their breath or blood for alcohol concentration, such a refusal is admissible evidence. You may infer from the refusal that the person was under the influence. The inference is rebuttable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b195-5\"><em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 7. Miller argued that absent a \u201ccompetent corroborating evidence\u201d instruction, the district court turned the permissive inference from \u00a761-8-404(2), MCA, into a mandatory presumption, creating an unconstitutional burden shift. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 19.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">\u00b658 We rejected Miller\u2019s argument, reasoning that when the jury instructions were viewed as a whole, they fully and fairly set forth the applicable law and did not result in an unconstitutional burden shift. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 23. The jury was informed that they were to consider all of the instructions as a whole, Miller was presumed innocent throughout the entire trial, the State had the burden to overcome that presumption beyond a reasonable doubt, based upon all the evidence, and Miller was not required to present any evidence. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6\u00b6 22-23. Furthermore, the jury was instructed as to the specific elements of the DUI offense. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 22. We concluded that the lack of an explicit instruction regarding \u201ccompetent corroborating evidence\u201d was compensated for by the other instructions given to the jury. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 24. \u00b659 <em>Miller </em>is applicable to the case at hand. The District Court\u2019s rebuttable inference instruction is materially indistinguishable from the one given in <em>Miller. </em>Moreover, Larson\u2019s jury was instructed (1) to consider all of the instructions as a whole, (2) that Larson was presumed innocent throughout the proceedings, (3) that the State had the burden to prove Larson\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, based upon all the evidence, (4) that Larson was permitted to not testify or offer evidence, and (5) that each element of the DUI offense had to be proved beyond a reasonable doubt. Thus, when viewed as a whole, the instructions fully and fairly instructed the jury regarding the applicable law. The District Court did not abuse its discretion by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>rejecting Larson\u2019s proposed jury instruction.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b196-4\">\u00b660  Finally, based upon the evidence before the jury, Larson was not convicted solely on the basis of his refusal to submit to a blood test. Sufficient corroborating evidence of impairment was presented, including Larson\u2019s screeching and squealing of tires across the intersection while in plain view of two officers, the truck\u2019s wide turn into oncoming traffic, Larson\u2019s slow reactions, slurred speech, earlier consumption of alcohol, and poor performance on the field sobriety tests. Moreover, the jury heard that Larson retrieved a bag of marijuana and a pipe, and told the officers that he had smoked an hour prior. The jury was well aware of their duty to consider all of this evidence. In light of the corroborating evidence presented, we cannot say the jury convicted Larson solely on his refusal to submit to a blood test.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">\u00b661 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b196-6\">JUSTICES MORRIS, WHEAT, LEAPHART and RICE concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b189-10\"> Both deputies, based on their personal observations, could have testified pursuant to M.
