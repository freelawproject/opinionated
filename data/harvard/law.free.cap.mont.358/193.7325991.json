She appeals the District Court\u2019s conclusion that her claims were barred by the Montana Human Rights Act and argues the court erred in finding the School District\u2019s action did not violate her rights to free speech and to freedom of religion under the United States and Montana Constitutions. We reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-11\">ISSUES</p>\n<p id=\"b217-12\">\u00b62 We consider the following issues:</p>\n<p id=\"b217-13\">\u00b63 1. Did the District Court err in ruling the exclusivity provision of the Montana Human Rights Act barred Griffith\u2019s claims for violation of her state and federal constitutional rights to free speech and freedom of religion?</p>\n<p id=\"b217-14\">\u00b64 2. Did the District Court err in concluding that the School District\u2019s refusal to permit Griffith to state her personal religious views during her valedictory speech did not violate Griffith\u2019s state and federal constitutional rights to free speech and freedom of religion?</p>\n<p id=\"b217-15\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b217-16\">\u00b65 The parties do not dispute the material facts. During the 2007-2008 academic year, Griffith was a senior at Butte High School (BHS), which is a school in the School District. Metz was the principal of BHS and Uggetti was the superintendent of the School District. Griffith, along with several classmates, achieved the distinction of being named valedictorians of the class of 2008, and was invited to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>speak at the May 29, 2008 graduation ceremony. Griffith was one of the valedictorians who expressed a desire to deliver a speech.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-4\">\u00b66 Neither the School District nor BHS had written guidelines for student speakers addressing the content of valedictory speeches. The students were told their remarks had to be \u201cappropriate, in good taste and grammar, and should be relevant to the closing of [their] high school years.\u201d The style and topic of the speech was left to each speaker. Since there were several valedictorians, Griffith was asked to give her remarks jointly with another student, Ethan Keeler. Together, Griffith and Keeler decided to give a speech in an alternating fashion on the topic of what they learned in high school.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">\u00b67 Among the remarks Griffith wrote and intended to deliver at the graduation ceremony, she included the following passage:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b218-6\">I learned to persevere these past four years, even through failure or discouragement, when I had to stand for my convictions. I can say that my regrets are few and far between. I didn\u2019t let fear keep me from sharing Christ and His joy with those around me. I learned to impart hope, to encourage people to treat each day as a gift. I learned not to be known for my grades or for what I did during school, but for being committed to my faith and morals and being someone who lived with a purpose from God with a passionate love for Him.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b218-7\">Griffith felt she could not accurately convey her high school experience without mentioning these motivations for her accomplishments, actions, and life purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-8\">\u00b68 In the days prior to the graduation ceremony, the student speakers met with Stephen Riordan, a speech coach asked by the school to assist the students with their speeches. During their second meeting, Riordan relayed a message from Superintendent Uggetti to Griffith-she must omit the references to \u2018God\u201d and \u2018Christ\u201d in her speech because religious references were not permitted in graduation speeches.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-9\">\u00b69 Two days before the graduation ceremony, Griffith and her father met with Uggetti, who gave them a copy of the School District\u2019s policies. Uggetti reiterated that religious references would not be allowed in students\u2019 graduation speeches. The two policies that relate to graduation ceremonies and speeches, and that are issue in this case, are School District Policies Nos. 2333 and 2332.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-10\">\u00b610 The relevant text of School District Policy No. 2333 is found under the heading <em>Organization and Content for Commencement Speeches </em>and states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ai\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>The school administration shall not censor any presentation or require any content, but may advise the participants about appropriate language for the audience and occasion. Students selected to participate may choose to deliver an address, poem, reading, song, musical presentation, prayer, or any other pronouncement of their choosing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b219-4\">This policy also requires the printed graduation ceremony program to include the following paragraphs (hereinafter the \u201cDisclaimer\u201d):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b219-5\"><em>Any presentation by participants of graduation exercises is the private expression of the individual participants and does not necessarily reflect any official position of the </em>District, <em>its Board, administration, or employees, or indicate the views of any other graduates.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b219-6\">\n<em>The Board recognizes that at graduation time and throughout the course of the educational process, there will be instances where religious values, religious practices, and religious persons will have some interaction with the public schools and students. The Board, however, does not endorse religion, but recognizes the rights of individuals to have the freedom to express their individual political, social or religious views, for this is the essence of education.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b219-7\">Under the heading of <em>Graduation Ceremonies, </em>the pertinent section of School District Policy No. 2332 says:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b219-8\">Graduation is an important event for students and their families. In order to assure the appropriateness and dignity of the occasion, the District sponsors and pays for graduation ceremonies and retains ultimate control over their structure and content.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b219-9\">The District may not prefer the beliefs of some students over the beliefs of others, coerce dissenters or nonbelievers, or communicate any endorsement of religion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b219-10\">\u00b611 The School District contends that its practice is to follow Policy No. 2332 and not No. 2333, even though both policies are current and remain in effect. Thus, while the School District prints the Disclaimer set out in Policy No. 2333 in the graduation program, it also requires students to submit their remarks for review prior to the graduation ceremony. Contrary to the written non-censorship language in Policy No. 2332, it is the practice of the School District to prohibit religious references of any kind in student speeches.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-11\">\u00b612 Consequently, one day before the graduation ceremony, Uggetti summoned Griffith to his office and proposed the following changes to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>her remarks:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b220-4\">I learned to persevere these past four years, even through failure or discouragement, when I had to stand for my convictions. I can say that my regrets are few and far between. I didn\u2019t let fear keep me from sharing my faith with those around me. I learned to impart hope, to encourage people to treat each day as a gift. I learned not to be known for my grades or for what I did during school, but for being committed to my faith and morals and being someone who lived with a purpose derived from my faith and based on a love of mankind. (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">\u00b613 Griffith informed Uggetti she would not change her original remarks because she believed she could not speak of what she had learned in high school without acknowledging Christ and God. Uggetti told Griffith that, while he was ultimately in charge of the School District, he would defer to the judgment of Principal Metz concerning whether or not Griffith would be allowed to speak. He repeated, however, that it was unlikely she would be allowed to speak unless she removed the religious references.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">\u00b614 At the graduation practice, Metz called Griffith and Keeler aside and told Griffith she had to either remove the religious references from her remarks or not speak at all. Griffith responded that she would not change her speech.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-7\">\u00b615 In accordance with Policy No. 2333, the Disclaimer was printed in the May 29, 2008 BHS graduation program. During the graduation ceremony, Keeler gave his valedictory speech with another partner. Griffith was not permitted to speak because she would not remove the religious references from her speech.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-8\">The Human Rights Bureau Administrative Proceedings</p>\n<p id=\"A6P\">\u00b616 On July 23, 2008, Griffith filed a timely complaint with the Montana Human Rights Bureau (HRB). She alleged Uggetti, Metz, and the School District had discriminated against her in her education on the basis of creed or religion in violation of the Montana Human Rights Act (MHRA), specifically \u00a749-2-307, MCA. Pursuant to \u00a749-2-504(1), MCA, an HRB investigator conducted an informal investigation of Griffith\u2019s allegations of discrimination in education based on her religion. The investigator took statements from all of the parties, reviewed pertinent documents, and interviewed witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-9\">\u00b617 The investigator filed a Final Investigative Report with the HRB recommending a finding of \u2018ho cause to believe unlawful discrimination occurred as set forth in Griffith\u2019s complaint.\u201d On January 20, 2009, Griffith received a two-page letter from the HRB <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>entitled \u2018Notice of Dismissal and Notice of Right to File Civil Action in District Court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b221-4\">The District Court Proceedings</p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">\u00b618 Upon receipt of the notice of dismissal from the HRB and pursuant to \u00a749-2-511, MCA, Griffith filed a timely complaint in the Thirteenth Judicial District, Yellowstone County. Griffith claimed the School District, Uggetti, and Metz violated her state and federal constitutional rights to free speech and freedom of religion. Her complaint alleged, in six counts, that the defendants violated: (I) the MHRA, Title 49, chapter 2, MCA; (II) the Governmental Code of Fair Practices, Title 49, chapter 3, MCA;<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (III) Article II, Section 5 of the Montana Constitution; (IV) Article II, Section 7 of the Montana Constitution; (V) the First Amendment to the United States Constitution; and (VI) the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. Griffith\u2019s complaint prayed for nominal and compensatory damages, as well as attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">\u00b619 On cross-motions for summary judgment, the District Court found in favor of the School District. The court determined the exclusivity provision of the MHRA barred Counts III through VI because, while Griffith pled these claims as constitutional tort actions, the gravamen of the claims was discrimination. As to Count I, violation of the MHRA, the District Court found the School District did not violate the First Amendment to the United States Constitution or \u00a749-2-307(1), MCA, when it prohibited Griffith from delivering her unedited remarks. The court concluded that the School District\u2019s practice of excluding expression of personal religious views in student speeches was a reasonable basis for its action against Griffith. Furthermore, since the practice was applied evenly, and with the intent to preclude any implied endorsement of religious views by the School District, the court held the School District\u2019s decision prohibiting Griffith from speaking did not violate either the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution or \u00a749-2-307(1), MCA. \u00b620 Griffith appeals the District Court\u2019s order granting summary judgment in favor of the School District, Uggetti, and Metz.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-7\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b221-8\">\u00b621 We review orders of summary judgment de novo, applying the same criteria employed by the district court pursuant to M. R. Civ. P. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>56. <em>PPL </em>Montana, <em>LLC v. State, </em>2010 MT 64, \u00b6 84, 355 Mont. 402, 229 P.3d 421. Summary judgment is appropriate when \u2018the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\u201d M. R. Civ. P. 56(c). When the material facts are undisputed, we review a district court\u2019s conclusions of law for correctness. <em>Edwards v. Cascade Co. Sheriff\u2019s Dept., </em>2009 MT 451, \u00b6 38, 354 Mont. 307, 223 P.3d 893.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">\u00b622 The School District first argues Griffith\u2019s claims are moot because Griffith has graduated from BHS and has not sought monetary damages. Griffith asserts that she seeks to vindicate her constitutional rights and her original claim for nominal damages in her complaint prevents the action from becoming moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">\u00b623 \u2018Mootness is a threshold issue which we must resolve before addressing the substantive merits of a dispute.\u201d <em>In the Matter of the Mental Health of D.V., </em>2007 MT 351, \u00b6 30, 340 Mont. 319, 174 P.3d 503 <em>(quoting Havre Daily News, LLC v. City of Havre, </em>2006 MT 215, \u00b6 31, 333 Mont. 331, 142 P.3d 864). A matter is moot when, due to the occurrence of an event or passage of time, the issue ceases to present a justiciable controversy or the court cannot grant effective relief. <em>Id. </em>\u00b624 Griffith\u2019s prayer in her complaint for nominal damages for violation of her constitutional rights prevents this action from becoming moot. <em>Jacobs v. Clark Co. Sch. Dist., </em>526 F.3d 419, 425-26 (9th Cir. 2008) (citing <em>Bernhardt v. Co. of Los Angeles, </em>272 F.3d 862, 872 (9th Cir. 2002)). Plaintiffs who prove a violation of their constitutional rights must be awarded nominal damages as a matter of law. <em>Cummings v. Connell, </em>402 F.3d 936, 944 (9th Cir. 2005) (citing <em>Schneider v. Co. of San Diego, </em>285 F.3d 784, 794-95 (9th Cir. 2002)); <em>see also Carey v. Piphus, </em>435 U.S. 247, 266, 98 S. Ct. 1042, 1053-54 (1978). As Griffith\u2019s complaint clearly prays for nominal damages; her claim is not moot. As a result, we address the merits of the substantive issues presented on appeal.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b222-7\">\u00b625 Issue One. Did the District Court err in ruling the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>exclusivity provision of the Montana Human Rights Act barred Griffith\u2019s claims for violation of her state and federal constitutional rights to free speech and freedom of religion?</p>\n<p id=\"b223-4\">\u00b626 \u201cWe determine the substantive rights between the parties according to the law in effect at the date of injury.\u201d <em>Boettcher v. Mont. Guaranty Fund, </em>2007 MT 69, \u00b6 14, 336 Mont. 393, 154 P.3d 629 (quoting <em>Anderson v. Werner Enterprises, Inc., </em>1998 MT 333, \u00b6 28, 292 Mont. 284, 972 P.2d 806). Griffith\u2019s injury occurred in May 2008. The law in effect at the time of Griffith\u2019s injury was the 2007 version of the MHRA. In reaching its decision, the District Court purported to apply the 2009 version of the MHRA, which is in all pertinent respects the same as the 2007 version. However, the court then went on to erroneously analyze this case under the rationale of <em>Saucier v. McDonald\u2019s Restaurants of Montana, Inc., </em>2008 MT 63, 342 Mont. 29, 179 P.3d 481. Our reasoning in <em>Saucier </em>was wholly premised on the 2001 version of the MHRA that was in effect at the time of Saucier\u2019s claimed injury. As we noted in Footnote 1 of <em>Saucier, </em>\u201c[bjecause many portions of the MHRA have been revised since its enactment ... all statutory references in this Opinion are to the 2001 version of the MHRA, which was in effect during the time period relevant to this case.\u201d <em>Saucier, </em>\u00b6 37. Given the significant revisions to the MHRA in 2007, which change and simplify the exclusivity provision of the MHRA that was at issue in <em>Saucier, </em>much of the analysis in <em>Saucier </em>has no application here.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">\u00b627 This is the first opportunity this Court has had to interpret the MHRA\u2019s procedural and exclusivity provisions, as amended in 2007. Since neither the parties nor the District Court acknowledged or addressed the Montana Legislature\u2019s 2007 amendments, we review the salient MHRA provisions and note the significant changes made by the Legislature. We then apply the correct law to the facts of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-6\">A. The 2007 amendments to the MHRA</p>\n<p id=\"AQB\">\u00b628 In 2007, the Montana Legislature enacted House Bill 76 (HB 76) to amend the MHRA and specifically address the confusion courts and attorneys expressed regarding when and how a complaint alleging discrimination could be brought to district courts in light of the exclusive remedy provision of the MHRA. <em>See </em>Mont. H. Bus. &amp; Lab. Comm., <em>Minutes on the Hearing on HB </em>76,60th Leg., Reg. Sess. 3 (Jan. 12,2007). During both the House and Senate hearings, the sponsor of HB 76, Rep. Walter McNutt, clearly expressed that the intent of the 2007 amendments was to clarify the procedures. <em>Id. </em>Germane to this case are the amendments clarifying how a case that is initially brought <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>to the HRB can, ultimately, proceed to the district court for a trial on the merits. Sections 49-2-504, -511 and -512, MCA (2007), contain the significant procedures.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-4\">\u00b629 Section 49-2-504(7)(b), MCA. The 2007 Legislature added new subsection (7)(b) to the then-existing \u00a749-2-504, MCA:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-5\">(7)(b) If the department finds that there is no reasonable cause to believe that unlawful discrimination occurred, it shall issue a notice of dismissal and dismiss the case from the department\u2019s administrative process. After receipt of a notice of dismissal, a charging party may:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-6\">(i) continue the administrative process by filing objections with the commission as provide in 49-2-511; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-7\">(ii) discontinue the administrative process and commence proceedings in district court as provided in 49-2-511. (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b224-8\">\u00b630 Section 49-2-509, MCA. This section was repealed in 2007. Prior to 2007, subsection (7) contained the exclusivity provision that we interpreted in <em>Saucier, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 43-44, <em>Vettel-Becker v. Deaconess Med. Ctr. of Billings, Inc., </em>2008 MT 51, \u00b6\u00b6 31-34, 341 Mont. 435, 177 P.3d 1034, and <em>Edwards, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 69-75.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-9\">\u00b631 Section 49-2-511, MCA. This section was added as a new section in 2007. Relevant to this case is subsection (3)(a), which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-10\">Dismissal after informal proceedings -filing of objections -procedures -action in district court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-11\">(3)(a) Within 90 days after the department has issued a notice of dismissal pursuant to 49-2-501(5) or 49-2-504(7)(b) or within 90 days after the commission has issued an order affirming the department\u2019s notice of dismissal pursuant to subsection (2)(b) of this section, the charging party may commence a civil action for appropriate relief on the merits of the case in the district court in the district in which the alleged violation occurred. If the charging party fails to commence the civil action in the district court within 90 days after the final agency decision has been issued, the claim is barred. The court may provide the same relief as described in 49-2-506. In addition, the court may in its discretion allow the prevailing party reasonable attorney fees and costs. (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b224-12\">\u00b632 Section 49-2-512, MCA. This section became a stand-alone section in 2007. While subsection (1) contains the same exclusivity provision previously codified as \u00a749-2-509(7), MCA, subsections (2) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>and (3) were added:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-4\">Filing in district court -compliance with administrative procedures required. (1) The provisions of this chapter establish the exclusive remedy for acts constituting an alleged violation of chapter 3 or this chapter, including acts that may otherwise also constitute a violation of the discrimination provisions of Article II, section 4, of the Montana constitution or 49-1-102. A claim or request based upon the acts may not be entertained by a district court other than by the procedures specified in this chapter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-5\">(2) In addition to dismissal under 49-2-501(5) or 49-2-504(7)(b), the department shall dismiss a complaint if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-6\">(a) the charging party fails to keep the department advised of changes of address and the department finds that the failure has impeded the administrative proceedings; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-7\">(b) a period of 12 months has elapsed from the filing of a complaint and neither the department nor the commission has held a hearing pursuant to 49-2-505 or an informal hearing pursuant to 49-2-511. However, the department or the commission may refuse to dismiss a complaint under this subsection (2)(b) if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-8\">(i) more than 30 days have elapsed since service of notice of hearing under 49-2-505;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-9\">(ii) the parties have stipulated to a reasonable extension of the timeframes; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-10\">(iii) through litigation a party has unsuccessfully sought to prevent the department or the commission from conducting administrative proceedings on the complaint.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-11\">(3) Within 90 days after the department has issued a notice of dismissal pursuant to subsection (2), the charging party may commence a civil action for appropriate relief on the merits of the case in the district court in the district in which the alleged violation occurred. If the charging party fails to commence the civil action in the district court within 90 days after the dismissal has been issued, the claim is barred. The court may provide the same relief as described in 49-2-506. In addition, the court may in its discretion allow the prevailing party reasonable attorney fees and costs. (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-12\">B. Statutory interpretation of the 2007 MHRA.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b225-13\">\u00b633 The rules of statutory construction are well-settled. Section 1-2-101, MCA, commands that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>In the construction of a statute, the office of the judge is simply to ascertain and declare what is in terms or in substance contained therein, not insert what has been omitted or to omit what has been inserted. Where there are several provisions or particulars, such a construction is, if possible, to be adopted as will give effect to all.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b226-4\">Additionally, \u2018the intention of the legislature is to be pursued if possible,\u201d \u00a7 1-2-102, MCA, and no further interpretation is required when the plain language of the statute is clear and unambiguous. <em>Miller v. Eighteenth Jud. Dist. Ct., </em>2007 MT 149, \u00b6 38, 337 Mont. 488, 162 P.3d 121 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">\u00b634 The plain language of \u00a749-5-504, -511, and -512, MCA (2007), is clear and unambiguous.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Section 49-2-504(7)(b)(ii), MCA, clearly states that once the HRB dismisses a complaint, the charging party may file a complaint in district court, so long as the party complies with \u00a749-2-511, MCA, and files the complaint within ninety days of the HRB\u2019s notice of dismissal. Additionally, \u00a749-2-511(3)(a), MCA, clarifies that, at this point, the district court must hold a trial on the merits of the case and may provide the relief outlined in \u00a7 49-2-506, MCA, in addition to awarding attorney fees and costs. This plain reading of the statues is harmonious with the 2007 Legislature\u2019s intent to clarify the procedural pathway a discrimination case takes through the HRB process.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-6\">\u00b635 Given the 2007 substantive revisions to the MHRA, the gravamen analysis upon which we relied commencing with <em>Harrison v. </em>Chance, 244 Mont. 215, 797 P.2d 200 (1990), and through our decisions in <em>Saucier, Vettel-Becker, andEdwards </em>is, mercifully, no longer necessary when analyzing the propriety of filing suit in district court following notice of dismissal by the HRB. We caution their holdings may still be viable, however, in those situations where the plaintiff files a claim \u201csounding in discrimination\u201din the district court without first filing a claim before the HRB and receiving a notice of dismissal. <em>See Vettel-Becker, </em>\u00b6 <em>37\\ Edwards, </em>\u00b6 75. If a claim \u201csounding in discrimination\u201d is brought to the district court absent an accompanying notice of dismissal from the HRB, it could be barred by \u00a7 49-2-512(1), MCA (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b227-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>C. Griffith\u2019s claims are not barred by the MHRA exclusivity provision</p>\n<p id=\"b227-4\">\u00b636 The statutory language of \u00a7\u00a749-2-504, -511 and -512, MCA, is unambiguous. The statutes permit a party to take a case to district court for a trial on the merits once the action is dismissed from the HRB. There is no provision that allows a district court to essentially remand a case back to the HRB if it disagrees with the HRB and finds the complaint sounds in discrimination. In this situation, \u00a7\u00a7 49-2-511(3)(a) and -512(3), MCA, specifically state the district court may provide the same relief to the prevailing party as would have been received in the administrative process.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">\u00b637 Accordingly, Griffith was entitled to a trial in district court addressing the merits of all of her claims, including her discrimination allegations. Griffith complied with \u00a749-2-501, MCA, and filed a timely complaint with the HRB. Upon concluding its investigation, the HRB issued a notice of dismissal and right to sue in district court, in compliance with the plain language of \u00a749-2-504(7)(b), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">\u00b638 In the notice of dismissal, the HRB outlined Griffith\u2019s options for appealing its decision, including her right to a trial on the merits in district court. The notice accurately reflected and conveyed the plain language of the MHRA. It stated that, pursuant to \u00a749-2-504(7), MCA, \u201cthe HRB shall dismiss a complaint and the charging party may file a civil action in the district court\u201d if the HRB finds the complaint was unsupported by a preponderance of the evidence. The notice went on to state, in all capital letters, that Griffith had ninety days from the date of the notice of dismissal to file a complaint in district court. The notice ended by reiterating: (1) the case was dismissed from the administrative procedure; (2) the charging party may file an action in district court; and (3) the district court may award attorney fees to the prevailing party.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-7\">\u00b639  We conclude that, on its face, the notice of dismissal comports with the plain meaning of the current MHRA. We defer to the HRB\u2019s interpretation because it is reasonable and in accordance with the spirit and the legislative intent of the amended statutes. <em>Clark Fork Coalition v. Mont. Dept. of Envtl. Quality, </em>2008 MT 407, \u00b6 20, 347 Mont. 197, 197 P.3d 482. Therefore, we reverse the District Court and hold that Griffith\u2019s claims were not barred by the exclusivity provision of the MHRA.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-8\">\u00b640 Issue Two. Did the District Court err in concluding that the School District\u2019s refusal to permit Griffith to state her personal religious views during her valedictory speech did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>violate Griffith\u2019s state and federal constitutional rights to free speech and freedom of religion?</p>\n<p id=\"b228-4\">\u00b641 Before turning to the substantive merits of Griffith\u2019s appeal, we address two preliminary issues. First, for the reasons set forth below, Griffith\u2019s claims were properly pled as constitutional tort actions. We agree with the HRB that her claims did not allege discrimination within the meaning of the MHRA.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">\u00b642 Second, the parties present several undeveloped arguments that we decline to consider. Parties must present a reasoned argument to advance their positions, supported by citations to appropriate authority. M. R. App. P. 12(f). When a party fails to do so, our caselaw is well-settled. We will not consider unsupported issues or arguments. <em>In re Marriage of McMahon, </em>2002 MT 198, \u00b6 6, 311 Mont. 175, 53 P.3d 1266. Moreover, \u201c[i]t is not this Court\u2019s job to conduct legal research on [a party\u2019s] behalf, to guess as to [a party\u2019s] precise position, or to develop legal analysis that may lend support to that position.\u201d <em>Johansen v. Dept. of Nat. Resources &amp; Conservation, </em>1998 MT 51, \u00b6 24, 288 Mont. 39, 955 P.2d 653 (citations omitted); <em>see also State v. Gomez, </em>2007 MT 111, \u00b6 33, 337 Mont. 219, 158 P.3d 442.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">\u00b643 Griffith presents a two-paragraph, undeveloped argument that the School District violated her right to free speech under Article II, Section 7 of the Montana Constitution. The School District does not address Article II, Section 7 of the Montana Constitution at all, except to assert it did not violate Griffith\u2019s right to free speech under the provision. We will not formulate arguments for the parties; we therefore decline to consider this issue further.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-7\">\u00b644 Next, Griffith presents an undeveloped argument that the School District violated her constitutional right to equal protection of the law under the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution because the School District prohibited her from delivering her unedited valedictory speech. She does not identify what group or classification is at issue, or whether she claims to be a \u201cclass of one,\u201d which is the preliminary step of an equal protection analysis. The School District merely reiterates portions of its First Amendment arguments without squarely addressing the equal protection claim. Neither party presents a fully-developed legal analysis as to the equal protection claim. Therefore, we also decline to consider this issue further.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-8\">\u00b645  With those preliminary matters addressed, for the reasons discussed herein, we hold: (1) the School District violated Griffith\u2019s right to freedom of speech under the First Amendment of the United <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>States Constitution, entitling her to relief under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 (2006); and (2) the School District did not violate Griffith\u2019s right to freedom of religion under either Article II, Section 5 of the Montana Constitution or the First Amendment of the United States Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-4\">A. The School District violated Griffith\u2019s constitutional right to freedom of speech when it imposed a non-neutral, viewpoint-based limitation on the content of her valedictory speech</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">\u00b646 \u2018It is axiomatic that the government may not regulate speech based on its substantive content or the message it conveys.\u201d <em>Denke v. Shoemaker, </em>2008 MT 418, \u00b6 47, 347 Mont. 322, 198 P.3d 284 (quoting <em>Rosenberger v. Rector &amp; Visitors of the Univ. of Virginia, </em>515 U.S. 819, 828, 115 S. Ct. 2510, 2516 (1995)). Viewpoint discrimination is \u201can egregious form of content discrimination,\u201d and \u201cthe government must abstain from regulating speech when the specific motivating ideology or the opinion or perspective of the speaker is the rationale for the restriction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Rosenberger, </em>515 U.S. at 829, 115 S. Ct. at 2516). These basic principles of constitutional law forbid the government from practicing viewpoint discrimination in any forum-public, limited public, or non-public. <em>Rosenberger, </em>515 U.S. at 829-30, 115 S. Ct. at 2516-17.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">\u00b647 Students\u2019 free speech rights in a school setting have not historically turned on the type of forum created by a graduation ceremony, or the degree of regulatory control school officials have in each of those various forums. As discussed more fully below, the extent of a student\u2019s right to free speech is determined on a case-by-case basis, in light of the special circumstances of a school environment. <em>Infra </em>\u00b6 49. Because questions regarding forum (public, limited public, or non-public) have not formed part of the analysis in free speech cases arising in the school environment, the parties\u2019 arguments asserting general First Amendment forum concerns are inapposite.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-7\">\u00b648 The United States Supreme Court\u2019s present approach to a student\u2019s right to free speech was first articulated in <em>Tinker v. Des Moines Indep. Community Sch. Dist., </em>393 U.S. 503, 89 S. Ct. 733 (1969). Since then, however, the United States Supreme Court has often \u201cset the [Tinker] standard aside on an ad hoc basis.\u201d <em>Morse v. Frederick, </em>551 U.S. 393, 417-18, 127 S. Ct. 2618, 2634 (2007) (Thomas, J. concurring). Therefore, we must extrapolate the pertinent rules from the relevant federal cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-8\">\u00b649 Students \u201cdo not shed their constitutional rights to freedom of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>speech or expression at the schoolhouse gate,\u201d but their rights are not commensurate with the rights of adults and \u201cmust be applied in light of the special circumstances of the school environment.\u201d <em>Hazelwood Sch. Dist. v. Kuhlmeier, </em>484 U.S. 260, 266, 108 S. Ct. 562, 567 (1988) (quoting <em>Tinker, </em>393 U.S. at 506, 89 S. Ct. at 736). School officials may not impose viewpoint-based limitations on student speech in the school setting unless (1) school officials reasonably conclude the speech will \u201cmaterially and substantially disrupt the work and discipline of the school,\u201d <em>Tinker, </em>393 U.S. at 513, 89 S. Ct at 740; (2) the student\u2019s expression in a school-sponsored activity may reasonably be \u201cperceive[d] to bear the imprimatur of the school,\u201d <em>Hazelwood, </em>484 U.S. at 271, 108 S. Ct. at 570; or (3) the expression can be \u201creasonably viewed as promoting illegal drug use.\u201d <em>Morse, </em>551 U.S. at 409, 127 S. Ct. at 2629.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-4\">\u00b650  Applying this analytical framework to Griffith\u2019s case, we conclude the School District violated Griffith\u2019s constitutional right to free speech because this matter does not fall within any of the three recognized situations in which it is permissible for school officials to impose a viewpoint-based limitation on student speech. First, the <em>Morse </em>exception is clearly inapplicable because Griffith\u2019s religious references in her valedictory speech are wholly unrelated to illegal drug use. Second, it would be unreasonable to conclude that Griffith\u2019s brief mention of her personal religious views would materially and substantially disrupt the graduation ceremony, and indeed the School District never argues as such. Finally, we address the only exception argued by the partieswvhether Griffith\u2019s passing references to God and Christ could \u2018he perceived to bear the imprimatur of the school.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">\u00b651 We find it unreasonable for the School District to conclude that Griffith\u2019s cursory references to her personal religious beliefs could be viewed by those in attendance at the BHS graduation ceremony as a religious endorsement by the School District. To that end, we find both the District Court\u2019s and the School District\u2019s reliance on <em>Cole v. Oroville Union High School District, </em>228 F.3d 1092 (9th Cir. 2000) misplaced. The District Court and the School District cite <em>Cole </em>for the proposition that because the School District retained control over the graduation ceremony, it was permissible for Uggetti and Metz to censor Griffith\u2019s speech to prevent, presumably, the School District running afoul of the Establishment Clause. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">\u00b652 As the School District correctly recognizes in its brief, <em>Cole </em>is factually distinct from this case. Cole, a senior at Oroville High School, attempted to deliver a sectarian, proselytizing invocation, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>Niemeyer, another senior, attempted to deliver a valedictory speech that could easily be characterized as a sermon. <em>Cole, </em>228 F.3d at 1097. Niemeyer\u2019s speech \u201cadvised the audience that \u2018we are all God\u2019s children, through Jesus Christ [sic] death, when we accept his free love and saving grace in our lives,\u2019 \u2019\u2019requested the audience accept that God created man, and called upon the audience to \u2018yield to God our lives.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Establishment Clause of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution \u201cguarantees that government may not coerce anyone to support or participate in religion or its exercise, or otherwise act in a way which \u2018establishes a [state] religion or religious faith, or tends to do so.\u2019 \u201d <em>Lee v. Weisman, </em>505 U.S. 577, 587, 112 S. Ct. 2649, 2655 (1992) (citations omitted); <em>see Cole, </em>228 F.3d at 1104.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-4\">\u00b653 The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals concluded that the school district\u2019s refusal to permit Cole and Niemeyer to give their respective speeches was reasonable because both the invocation and the valedictory speech were sectarian and proselytizing, which is a type of speech that is, \u2018by definition, designed to reflect, and even convert others, to a particular religious viewpoint.\u201d <em>Cole, </em>228 F.3d at 1103 (quoting Doe <em>v. Santa Fe Indep. Sch. Dist., </em>168 F.3d 806, 817-18 (5th Cir. 1999)). The court further stated that, since Niemeyer was undeniably calling on the audience to join him in his beliefs, a reasonable dissenter or nonbeliever could believe that the school district was compelling implicit participation in the proselytizing, which amounts to unconstitutional governmental sponsorship of religion and a clear Establishment Clause violation. <em>Id. </em>at 1104 (\u2018The critical inquiry under <em>Santa Fe </em>and <em>Lee </em>to determine if religious activity at a major public school event constitutes impermissible coercion to participate is whether \u2018a reasonable dissenter ... could believe that the group exercise signified her own participation or approval of it.\u2019 \u201d (citation omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">\u00b654 If Niemeyer\u2019s remarks represent one end of the spectrum, Griffith\u2019s remarks fall on the other end, as the School District once again recognizes in its brief. In a two-page speech, given jointly with another student and premised on a theme of what they learned in high school, Griffith references God or Christ three times. Moreover, each of those references is prefaced by \u201cI learned,\u201d or \u201cmy faith,\u201d and each is unmistakably directed to her personal life and beliefs. Not once did Griffith use the term \u201cwe\u201d or \u2018you\u201d; her passing references to her personal beliefs cannot be construed as proselytizing; and her remarks were not part of a group exercise and did not elicit audience participation.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>\u00b655 Furthermore, contrary to <em>Cole, </em>no objectively reasonable observer could perceive that Griffith\u2019s religious references bore the imprimatur of the School District. In fact, the School District explicitly dissociated itself from Griffith\u2019s speech by printing the unambiguous Disclaimer in each graduation program pursuant to Policy No. 2333 stating \u201cany presentation by participants ... is the private expression of the individual participants and does not necessarily reflect any official position of the District, its Board, administration, or employees, or indicate the views of any other graduates.\u201d More to the point, the second paragraph of the printed Disclaimer avows that any religious expression by students is not endorsed by the School District and then goes on to clarify that individuals \u2018have the freedom to express their individual political, social or religious views, for this is the essence of education.\u201d Under these circumstances, there is no real likelihood Griffith\u2019s passing religious references in her valedictory speech would have been construed by any in attendance as an endorsement of religious views by the School District.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-4\">\u00b656  Finally, the School District violated its own written policies of non-censorship when it prohibited Griffith from giving her chosen remarks. Policy No. 2333, which explicitly addresses content for graduation speeches, states \u201cthe school administration shall not censor any presentation or require any content\u201d and that students who are selected to speak may choose to deliver \u201can address, poem, reading, song, musical presentation, prayer or any other pronouncement of their choosing.\u201d The School District ignored this policy by requiring Griffith to remove the words \u2018God\u201d and \u2018Christ\u201d from her speech.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">\u00b657  For the aforementioned reasons, we reach a narrow holding based on the particular facts of this case. We hold that the School District violated Griffith\u2019s right to freedom of speech under the First Amendment of the United States Constitution when it impermissibly censored the content of her valedictory speech based on the viewpoint she expressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-6\">B. Griffith is entitled to relief under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 because the School District, a governmental entity, violated her constitutional right to free speech</p>\n<p id=\"A54\">\u00b658 Since we find that School District deprived Griffith of a federal constitutional right, she is entitled to seek relief under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 (\u00a71983). \u2018Section 1983 \u2018is not itself a source of substantive rights, but merely provides a method for vindicating federal rights elsewhere conferred.\u2019 \u201d <em>Jones v. Mont. Univ. Sys. </em>2007 MT 82, \u00b6 32, 337 Mont. 1, 155 P.3d 1247 (quoting <em>Albright v. Oliver, </em>510 U.S. 266, 271, 114 S. Ct. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>807, 811 (1994)). To evaluate a \u00a71983 claim, the first step is to identify the specific federal constitutional violation, and the second step is to determine whether the officials who violated a plaintiff s constitutional rights were acting under the color of state law. <em>Brown v. McDonald, </em>2007 MT 197, \u00b6 12, 338 Mont. 390, 165 P.3d 1125 (citations omitted). \u00b659 [6] Griffith satisfies the first part of the \u00a7 1983 analysis because her federal constitutional right to free speech, as guaranteed by the First Amendment, was violated when she was prohibited from delivering her valedictory speech. <em>Supra </em>\u00b6 57. We conclude that the second part of the analysis is satisfied as well. The School District is a government entity. Sections 2-9-101(3) and (5), MCA. During the 2007-2008 academic year, Uggetti and Metz, as employees of the School District, were acting in their official capacities as School District superintendent and BHS principal, respectively. Section 2-9-101(2)(a), MCA. The constitutional violation occurred when Uggetti and Metz precluded Griffith from delivering her chosen remarks at the graduation ceremony. It is undisputed that this was done during the course and scope of their employment as school officials. Because the School District, through the actions of Uggetti and Metz, violated her First Amendment right to free speech, Griffith is entitled to relief under her \u00a7 1983 claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-4\">\u00b660  The District Court did not reach the question of whether Uggetti and Metz as individually-named defendants, are individually liable for their actions against Griffith. We conclude they are not and they should be dismissed from the action. Section 2-9-305(5), MCA, serves as a complete bar to holding Uggetti and Metz individually liable because it provides immunity from suit to individually-named defendants for actions performed within the course and scope of the official\u2019s employment. <em>See Kiely Constr., LLC v. City of Red Lodge, </em>2002 MT 241, \u00b6\u00b6 88-89, 312 Mont. 52, 57 P.3d 836; <em>see also Germann v. Stephens, </em>2006 MT 130, \u00b6 55, 332 Mont. 303, 137 P.3d 545 (in a \u00a7 1983 claim, granting immunity to government officials does not deprive plaintiffs of a remedy against the government entity). All of Griffith\u2019s allegations turn on actions performed by Uggetti and Metz, as school officials, in the course and scope of their employment. On remand, we instruct the District Court to dismiss Uggetti and Metz as individual defendants pursuant to \u00a72-9-305(5), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">C. The School District did not violate Griffith\u2019s state and federal constitutional right to freedom of religion because it neither compelled Griffith to violate the tenets of her religion nor denied her an important governmental benefit</p>\n<p id=\"b234-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>\u00b661 Griffith argues that the School District infringed on her right to free exercise of religion in violation of Article II, Section 5 of the Montana Constitution and the First Amendment of the United States Constitution. She claims the School District unduly burdened her religious practice when it prohibited her from saying \u2018God\u201d and \u2018Christ\u201d in her valedictory speech. The School District argues that Griffith has not demonstrated that her religious beliefs mandate she include personal religious expression in her valedictory speech, nor has she shown that her religious beliefs proscribe delivery of a valedictory speech free of personal religious expression. On this issue, we agree with the School District.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-4\">\u00b662 \u201cA facially neutral regulation impermissibly infringes on the constitutional requirement of government neutrality if it unduly burdens the free exercise of religion.\u201d <em>Valley Christian Sch. v. Montana High Sch. Assoc., </em>2004 MT 41, \u00b6 7, 320 Mont. 81, 86 P.3d 554 (citing <em>Wisconsin v. Yoder, </em>406 U.S. 205, 220, 92 S. Ct. 1526, 1536 (1972)). To determine whether there is a burden on the free exercise of religion, this Court adopted the <em>Thomas </em>test established by the United States Supreme Court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-5\">Where the state conditions receipt of an important benefit upon conduct proscribed by a religious faith, or where it denies such a benefit because of conduct mandated by religious belief, thereby putting substantial pressure on an adherent to modify his behavior and to violate his beliefs, a burden upon religion exists.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Atm\"><em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Thomas v. Review Bd. of Indiana Empl. Sec. Div., </em>450 U.S. 707, 717-18, 101 S. Ct. 1425, 1432 (1981)).</p>\n<p id=\"b234-6\">\u00b663 The first part of the analysis under the <em>Thomas </em>test is to determine whether being permitted to deliver a valedictory speech at a high school graduation ceremony is an important benefit. A benefit is an \u201cadvantage or privilege.\u201d <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>166 (Bryan A. Garner ed., 8th ed., West 2004). We have previously recognized student participation in extracurricular activities as an important benefit. <em>Valley Christian School, </em>\u00b6 8 (citing <em>State ex. Rel. Bartmess v. Bd. of Trustees </em>[sic], 223 Mont. 269, 275, 726 P.2d 801, 804 (1986)). A student\u2019s invitation to deliver a valedictory speech is an honor conferred on the student based on the student\u2019s academic success throughout high school. An academic award is a privilege and is certainly analogous to the privilege of participating in extracurricular activities. It follows that delivering a valedictory speech is an important benefit.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-7\">\u00b664 The second part of the <em>Thomas </em>analysis focuses on whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>Griffith\u2019s conduct-expressing her personal religious views in her valedictory speech-was \u201cproscribed by a religious faith\u201d or \u201cmandated by a religious belief.\u201d <em>Valley Christian School, </em>\u00b6 7. Nothing before this Court indicates either that Griffith\u2019s religious faith mandates she include personal religious expressions in a speech or that her faith proscribes delivering a speech devoid of personal religious expression. Griffith\u2019s personal belief that she could not speak without mention of God and Christ during her speech is not equivalent to a mandate by her religious faith that she do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-4\">\u00b665  Therefore, Griffith cannot meet the second prong on the <em>Thomas </em>test because she cannot demonstrate that the School District\u2019s request that she omit \u2018God\u201d and \u2018Christ\u201d from her speech is incompatible with the tenets of her religious faith. Griffith has not shown that the School District unduly burdened her free exercise of religion when it conditioned the delivery of her valedictory speech on omitting \u2018God\u201d and \u2018Christ\u201d from the text. We hold the School District did not violate Griffith\u2019s constitutional right to freedom of religion.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">D. Griffith may be entitled to an award of attorney fees because she is the prevailing party under her 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 claim</p>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">\u00b666 A prevailing party in a \u00a71983 claim may be awarded reasonable attorney fees as part of the costs pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988(b). <em>Germann, </em>\u00b6 37. While the power of a court to award attorney fees under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988(b) is discretionary, \u201ca prevailing plaintiff in a \u00a71983 claim should ordinarily recover an attorneys fee \u2018unless special circumstances would render such an award unjust.\u2019 \u201d <em>Kiely, </em>\u00b6 50 (citation omitted). A party is considered to \u201cprevail when actual relief on the merits of [the plaintiffs] claim materially alters the legal relationship between the parties by modifying the defendant\u2019s behavior in a way that directly benefits the plaintiff.\u201d <em>Farrar v. Hobby, </em>506 U.S. 103, 111-12, 113 S. Ct. 566, 573 (1992). \u201cA plaintiff who wins nominal damages is a prevailing party under \u00a7 1988\u201d because an award of damages, in any amount, changes the legal relationship in favor of the plaintiff \u2018by forcing the defendant to pay an amount of money [the defendant] otherwise would not pay.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 112-13, 113 S. Ct. at 573-74.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-7\">\u00b667  Pursuant to the foregoing statutory law and caselaw, Griffith may be entitled to an award of attorney fees since we conclude she is the prevailing party. <em>Supra </em>\u00b6 57. We instruct the District Court to determine whether to award attorney fees under the law, and if so, to conduct a hearing on the amount.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b236-4\">\u00b668 In sum, we hold Griffith\u2019s constitutional claims were not barred by the exclusivity provisions of the MHRA and that the School District violated Griffith\u2019s First Amendment right to free speech. Furthermore, we reverse and remand for entry of summary judgment in Griffith\u2019s favor, consistent with this Opinion. We remand for a determination (1) of the amount of damages to which Griffith is entitled under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983; and (2) of whether Griffith is entitled to attorney fees, and, if so, for a hearing and determination of the amount.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">\u00b669 We reverse and remand consistent with this Opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b236-6\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES WHEAT, NELSON, MORRIS and RICE concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b221-9\"> Griffith did not appeal the District Court\u2019s ruling on this issue, and we therefore decline to address it in this Opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b222-8\"> The parties also addressed the exception to the mootness doctrine that exists when the issue is capable of repetition yet may evade review.

Having done so, I would not reach issues 2(b) and 2(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b236-9\">\u00b671 First of all, I note that the Court spends considerable time discussing the School District\u2019s written policies; how the policies are internally inconsistent and how the District\u2019s suggested edits violated Policy No. 3222. If the Court were reversing due to the District\u2019s violation of school policy, then the policies and the District\u2019s suggested edits would be relevant. However, the Court\u2019s self-described \"narrow holding\u201dis not that the school violated the policies, but that it violated the First Amendment Right of Free Speech. Thus the sole focus of the analysis should be: what was the content of Griffith\u2019s proposed speech, and did the District violate her right of free speech in not allowing her to deliver the speech as proposed?</p>\n<p id=\"b236-10\">\u00b672 Renee Griffith\u2019s proposed valedictory speech contained two references to God and one reference to Christ. She proposed to say that T can say that my regrets are few and far between. I didn\u2019t let fear keep me from <em>sharing Christ and His Joy with those around </em>me.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The Court holds that this was not proselytizing, and that not allowing Griffith to speak was viewpoint discrimination of protected free speech. I disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-11\">\u00b673 Initially, I question whether proselytizing is an accurate litmus test of <em>Establishment Clause </em>violations. Although the Ninth Circuit repeatedly referred to impermissible speech in <em>Cole v. Oroville Union High Sch., </em>228 F.3d 1092, 1104 (9th Cir. 2000), as proselytizing, the decisions in <em>Lee v. Weisman, </em>505 U.S. 577, 587-90, 112 S. Ct. 2649, 2655-57 (1992), and <em>Santa Fe Indep. Sch. Dist. </em>v. <em>Doe, </em>530 U.S. 290, 305-310, 120 S. Ct. 2266, 2276-79 (2002) make clear that the religious involvement need not be proselytizing or even sectarian in order to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>considered impermissible under the <em>Establishment Clause. </em>The invocation in <em>Lee </em>was decidedly non-sectarian, as was the prayer in <em>Santa Fe, </em>yet both were found to violate the <em>Establishment Clause. </em>As a legal matter, proselytizing speech will almost certainly trigger <em>Establishment Clause </em>concerns. This does not mean, however, that speech <em>must </em>be proselytizing to be found constitutionally impermissible. Sectarian religious references short of proselytizing may suffice. Nonetheless, assuming arguendo that proselytizing is the proper test, Griffith\u2019s proposed speech tests positive.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-4\">\u00b674 In seeking to \\share] Christ and His Joy with those around\u201dher, Griffith was seeking to induce others to join her religious faith. That is, she was proselytizing. Proselytizing speech is speech that \u201c[is], by definition ... designed to reflect, and even convert others to, a particular religious viewpoint ....\u201d <em>Doe v. Santa Fe Indep. Sch. Dist., </em>168 F.3d 806, 817 (5th Cir. 1999). To proselytize is \u2018It]o induce someone to convert to one\u2019s own religious faith.\u201d <em>American Heritage Dictionary </em>1454 (3rd ed., Houghton 1992). Even if Griffith\u2019s speech is not perceived as proselytizing, it illustrates the impossibility of having school administrators make such arbitrary determinations in the face of the <em>Establishment Clause.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">\u00b675 The critical inquiry under <em>Santa Fe </em>and <em>Lee </em>to determine if religious activity at a major public school event constitutes impermissible coercion to participate is whether \u201ca reasonable dissenter ... could believe that the group exercise signified her own participation or approval of it.\u201d <em>Lee, </em>505 U.S. at 593, 112 S. Ct. at 2658. The court here reasons that Griffith\u2019s three references to God or Christ were not proselytizing because she prefaced each reference with \u201cI learned\u201d or \u2018hay faith;\u201dthat she did not once use the term \u201cwe\u201d or \u2018Vou.\u201d This analysis overlooks that Griffith expressly sought to \u201cshare Christ and His Joy with those around her.\u201d \u2018Sharing\u201d is not a solitary endeavor. Rather, sharing is to enjoy or experience jointly with another or others. <em>American Heritage Dictionary </em>at 1659. \u2018Those around her\u201d were the hundreds of people in the captive audience. They were the \u201cwe\u201d and the Nou\u201d the Court overlooks.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-6\">\u00b676 In the present case, the purpose to be served by this gathering was to conduct a graduation ceremony, not to share a sectarian religious experience. The District had a legitimate interest in complying with the <em>Establishment Clause </em>by not lending its imprimatur to expressions of religious belief at the ceremony. Contrary to this Court\u2019s conclusion, it was not Griffith\u2019s religious viewpoint the District sought to exclude, but any sectarian religious content in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>general.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-4\">\u00b677 Griffith cites a number of cases in support of her free speech claim. These cases, however, are clearly distinguishable from a school sponsored graduation ceremony. Griffith cites <em>Lamb\u2019s Chapel v. Ctr. Moriches Union Free Sch. Dist., </em>508 U.S. 384, 393, 113 S. Ct. 2141, 2147 (1993), for the proposition that \u201ca school district could not permit school property to be used for the presentation of all views about family issues and child rearing except those dealing with the subject matter from a religious perspective,\u201d and <em>Rosenberger v. Rector &amp; Visitors of the Univ. of Va., 515 </em>U.S. 819, 831, 115 S. Ct. 2510, 2517 (1995), for the proposition that a university could not refuse to fund a student publication because it addressed issues from a religious perspective. Finally, she cites <em>Good News Club v. Milford Cent. Sch., 533 </em>U.S. 98, 107-09, 121 S. Ct. 2093, 2100-01 (2001), for the proposition that \u201cthe Court found viewpoint discrimination where a public school permitted nonreligious groups to meet on school property after school but prohibited a Christian club from doing so.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">\u00b678 The above decisions are all clearly distinguishable. They each involve voluntary participation. When a Christian Club uses school property as a meeting place, no one is required to attend; the public is free to participate or not. Likewise, when school property is used for the discussion of family issues and child rearing, whether from a religious viewpoint or not, no one is compelled to attend. A high school graduation ceremony, however, is an entirely different matter. Unlike after-hours meetings in <em>Good News Club </em>which lacked the imprimatur of the school, the \u201cessence of graduation is to place the school\u2019s imprimatur on the ceremony-including the student speakers that the school selected.\u201d <em>Lassonde v. Pleasanton Unified Sch. Dist., </em>320 F.3d 979, 985 (9th Cir. 2003), <em>cert. denied, </em>540 U.S. 817, 124 S. Ct. 78 (2003). High school graduation is one of life\u2019s more significant events. Attendance at high school graduation is compulsory. The speakers chosen by the school clearly have a \u201ccaptive\u201d audience. The student body of a public school is presumably very diverse with a mix of Christians, Jews, Muslims, atheists, and agnostics, many of whom would resent being required to attend a ceremony in which Christ and His Joy was being <em>shared </em>with those present in the captive audience. As the Court acknowledged in <em>Lee, </em>our society recognizes that even simply standing or remaining silent can signify adherence to the views of others. <em>Lee, </em>505 U.S. at 593, 112 S. Ct. at 2658. Accordingly, a reasonable dissenter could certainly feel that his/her silence signified approval or participation in this public sharing of Christ and His Joy.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>\u00b679 The Court here reasons that the school, through a disclaimer in the graduation program, made it clear that it was not sponsoring the speech. The disclaimer, although it may have alleviated concerns of school \u201csponsorship\u201d or \u201centanglement,\u201d does not address the coercive effect on dissenters. In <em>Lee, </em>the Court held that a school district violated the <em>Establishment Clause </em>when it invited a rabbi to deliver a nonsectarian, nonproselytizing prayer at its graduation ceremony. The Court noted the singular importance of a high school graduation as a once-in-a-lifetime event and the susceptibility of adolescents to peer and social pressure. This left a dissenting student with the unduly coercive dilemma of participating in the prayer against her conscience or missing her own high school graduation. Because this dilemma gave the dissenting students no legitimate alternative to attending their graduation, the Court concluded the school district had in effect compelled participation in an explicit religious exercise. <em>Id. </em>at 593-94, 112 S. Ct. at 2658-59. The dissenting students in Griffith\u2019s class were in the same untenable dilemma. They were part of a captive audience and had to choose between attending the ceremony and turning the other way when the speaker sought to \u201cshare Christ and His Joy\u201d or not attending their high school graduation.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-4\">\u00b680 Although Griffith\u2019s speech was not as blatant in its proselytizing as the speech the Court uses for contrast from <em>Cole, </em>it graphically illustrates the impracticality of having school administrators walk this Constitutional tightrope. What if three of four valedictorians made personal references to Christ or one speaker made five references to Christ? What if a speaker used ten references to \u201csharing the joy of Allah,\u201d would that be free speech or proselytizing? The question is answered in the asking. The line drawing will necessarily be subjective depending upon the administrator. The point being that school districts have a constitutional obligation to avoid violating the <em>Establishment Clause. Santa Fe, </em>530 U.S. at 301-02, 120 S. Ct. at 2275. In honoring that obligation, school districts are entitled to a degree of latitude. The proper test is not whether the speech in question would be constitutionally permissible; rather, it is whether the District \u201cacted reasonably to avoid violating the Establishment Clause.\u201d <em>Cole, </em>228 F.3d at 1105. There is \u201cno doubt that compliance with the Establishment Clause is a state interest sufficiently compelling to justify content-based restrictions on speech.\u201d <em>Capitol Square Review &amp; Advisory Bd. v. Pinette, </em>515 U.S. 753, 761-62, 115 S. Ct. 2440, 2446 (1995). Here the District was not engaging in viewpoint discrimination. In demanding that there be no sectarian religious references, it was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>properly imposing content-based restrictions. It had no other means of preventing the coerced participation in this \u201csharing\u201d of a sectarian religious experience. <em>See Lassonde, </em>320 F.3d at 984. The Butte School District did not act unreasonably.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-4\">\u00b681 I would affirm the decision of the District Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
