Joseph Kim Kuzara (Kuzara), a managing member| of Half Breed, filed a Motion to Compel Arbitration based on ar arbitration clause in the Half Breed Operating Agreement (OA). The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>District Court denied Kuzara\u2019s motion. Kuzara appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-4\">\u00b62 We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b455-6\">\u00b63 Section XII of Half Breed\u2019s OA contains the arbitration clause:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AOL\">Before an action may be brought by any member of the company challenging this agreement, any activity conducted pursuant to this agreement, or any interpretation of the terms of this agreement... one meeting of company members shall thereafter be held for the purpose of resolving a challenge.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-7\">[I]f a challenge cannot be resolved in such a meeting by a vote of a majority of actual member ownership interests, then the issue shall be submitted to a group of three arbitrators</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-8\">Arbitration of a challenge brought under this agreement shall be binding upon the parties hereto ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b455-9\">The Gordons\u2019 Application for Judicial Dissolution cited several grounds for dissolution, including (paraphrased):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-10\">1. The cattle purchased by Half Breed have not been transferred to the company.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-11\">2. Gordons have not received credit for their $ 26,000 capital contribution to Half Breed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-12\">3. Kuzara has failed to provide documentation and information to the Gordons\u2019 bookkeeper for tax preparation purposes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-13\">4. Kuzara failed to report income on his 2006 tax return, but rather reported unauthorized transfers of equity.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-14\">5. Kuzara has failed to pay the Gordons a share of the proceeds from cattle sales or profits.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-15\">6. Kuzara has refused to amend tax returns and refuses to file any tax returns for tax year 2008.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-16\">7. Kuzara\u2019s acts and omissions have caused irreparable damage to the company and, if allowed to proceed, will become even more damaging to the company and its members.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b455-17\">[4 The District Court recognized that the question of whether an Application for Judicial Dissolution must be arbitrated is an issue of Lrst impression in Montana and thus referenced a similar case decided &gt;y the Georgia Supreme Court, <em>Georgia Rehab. Ctr., Inc. v. Newman </em>Hosp., 658 S.E.2d 737 (Ga. 2008). In <em>Georgia Rehab. </em>Ctr., the Georgia upreme Court found an arbitration clause within an OA inapplicable the event of a petition for judicial dissolution. The District Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>here recognized that the Gordons seek judicial dissolution, which is a statutorily created remedy that only District Courts are authorized to grant. The District Court further concluded that because the requested dissolution does not challenge any action pursuant to the OA, the arbitration clause does not apply. Kuzara appeals the District Court\u2019s denial of his motion to compel arbitration.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-4\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">\u00b65 We review a district court\u2019s order regarding a motion to compel arbitration de novo. <em>State ex rel. Bullock v. Philip Morris, Inc., </em>2009 MT 261, \u00b6 14, 352 Mont. 30, 217 P.3d 475 (citing <em>Martz v. Beneficial Montana, </em>2006 MT 94, \u00b6 10, 332 Mont. 93, 135 P.3d 790).</p>\n<p id=\"b456-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b456-7\">\u00b66 It is fundamental to our analysis to point out that this contract does not concern \u2018interstate commerce\u201d and thus policy arguments favoring arbitration, typical of cases involving the Federal Arbitration Act, are not persuasive here. Additionally, neither party has argued the validity of the contract as a whole or the validity of the arbitration! clause.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The only issue before us is the application of the O. arbitration clause to judicial dissolution. This is a matter of firstl impression in Montana.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-8\">\u00b67 We have consistently held that arbitration agreements between| two parties are valid and enforceable. <em>Burkhart v. Semitool, </em>Inc., 2000 MT 201, \u00b6 15, 300 Mont. 480, 5 P.3d 1031 (citing \u00a727-5-114, MCA). The threshold inquiry is whether the parties agreed to arbitrate <em>Kortum-Managhan v. Herbergers NBGL, </em>2009 MT 79, \u00b6 15, 349 Mont 475, 204 P.3d 693 (citing <em>Zigrang v. U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray, Inc. </em>2005 MT 282, \u00b6 8, 329 Mont. 239, 123 P.3d 237). Because arbitratio: is a matter of contract, a party cannot be required to submit t arbitration any dispute that he has not agreed to submit. <em>Hubner </em>v. <em>Cutthroat Communs., </em>Inc., 2003 MT 333, \u00b6 21, 318 Mont. 421, 80 P.3 1256. Thus, the first task of a court asked to compel arbitration of dispute is to determine whether the parties agreed to arbitrate th dispute. <em>Philip Morris, </em>\u00b6 15. The District Court properly identified th; the pertinent question in this case is whether the parties have agree' to arbitrate in the event of an Application for Judicial Dissolution.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>\u00b68 The scope of the arbitration clause in the OA is explicit. The only actions subject to arbitration are those (1) challenging the agreement, (2) based on activity conducted pursuant to the agreement, or (3) challenging an interpretation of the agreement. The OA does not contain any provision addressing judicial dissolution. Thus, we cannot conclude that the parties ever agreed to arbitrate in the event of, or in lieu of, judicial dissolution pursuant to \u00a735-8-902, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-4\">\u00b69 Kuzara argues that the Gordons\u2019 Application for Dissolution contains allegations of Kuzara\u2019s conduct and thus dissolution is sought based on activity conducted pursuant to the agreement. Kuzara mischaracterizes the dissolution application. The Gordons\u2019 Application for Dissolution plainly requests statutory dissolution pursuant to \u00a735-8-902, MCA. Section 35-8-902, MCA, explains that a district court may order the dissolution of an LLC in the event that the activities described in \u00a735-8-902(a)-(e), MCA, have occurred and dissolution is warranted. The Gordons\u2019 Application for Judicial Dissolution invokes subsections (a), (b), and (e), which state that judicial dissolution may be ordered upon demonstration that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-5\">(a) the economic purposes of the company is likely to be unreasonably frustrated;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-6\">(b) another member has engaged in conduct relating to the company\u2019s business that makes it not reasonably practicable to carry on the company\u2019s business with that member remaining as a member;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-7\">(e) the members or managers in control of the company have acted, are acting, or will act in a manner that is illegal, oppressive, fraudulent, or unfairly prejudicial to the petitioner.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AdS\">\u00b610 Kuzara misinterprets the purpose of the factual allegations in the Gordons\u2019 Application for Dissolution. The Gordons are not bringing a cause of action based on Kuzara\u2019s conduct pursuant to the OA. Rather, the Gordons merely cite examples of conduct that they claim make Half Breed no longer economically feasible. These allegations are for the purpose of establishing that dissolution is appropriate under \u00a738-5-902, MCA. The mere fact that the conduct warranting dissolution consists of Kuzara\u2019s activities or that a court may look to the OA for guidance in determining whether the activities alleged amount to a substantial frustration for the LLC, does not mean that the Gordons are seeking anything other than judicial dissolution pursuant to \u00a738--902, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-8\">11 Kuzara argues that the Gordons are attempting to exclude him <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>rather than dissolve the LLC. This argument is also misplaced. Upon a showing that \u201cone or more of the members or managers have engaged in wrongful conduct or upon other cause shown,\u201d the district court may wind up the LLC. Section 35-8-903(l)(b), MCA. In winding up the business or affairs of the LLC, a district court may:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-4\">(b) settle and close the business of the limited liability company;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-5\">(c) dispose of and transfer the property of the limited liability company;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-6\">(d) discharge the liabilities of the limited liability company; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-7\">(e) distribute to the members any remaining assets of the limited liability company.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b458-8\">Section 35-8-903(2)(b)-(e), MCA. Kuzara is a managing member of Half Breed. The Gordons\u2019 Application for Dissolution includes the request that the District Court appoint someone other than Kuzara to wind up affairs and that the District Court consider Kuzara responsible for any fees or penalties assessed due to his harmful actions. Given that the District Court has the authority to discharge liabilities and distribute remaining assets, the relief that the Gordons request is clearly within the statutory boundaries of \u00a735-8-903, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-9\">\u00b612 As the District Court noted, the Georgia Supreme Court has addressed this issue in <em>Georgia Rehab. Ctr., </em>658 S.E.2d at 738. In <em>Georgia Rehab. Ctr., </em>the OA between Georgia Rehabilitation Center and Newman Hospital provided that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-10\">[A]ny dispute, controversy, or claim arising out of or in connection with, or relating to, this Operating Agreement or any breach or alleged breach thereof shall, upon the request of any party involved, be submitted to, and settled by, arbitration.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b458-11\"><em>Id. </em>The parties requested judicial dissolution pursuant to Ga. Code Ann. \u00a714-11-603. The Georgia Supreme Court reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-12\">With respect to the issue of dissolution, the Operating Agreement provides that dissolution of CRS pursuant to the agreement] occurs \u201conly upon ... [(1)] Dissolution Notice from a Member pursuant to [certain terms of the Operating Agreement] ... [(2)]| the unanimous -written agreement of all Members ... or [(3)] th bankruptcy or dissolution (a \u2018Withdrawal Event\u2019) of a Member.\u2019J It is undisputed that none of these aforementioned events forme' the basis for the dissolution of CRS in this case. Rather, th dissolution proceedings were commenced by Newman pursuan to OCGA \u00a7 14-11-603, which provides an independent legal] mechanism for judicial and administrative dissolution of alimitei liability company.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b459-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number><em>Id. </em>The court concluded that because dissolution was sought pursuant to statute, the dissolution did not arise out of or relate to the terms of the OA. <em>Id. </em>In reaching that conclusion, the Georgia Supreme Court also addressed the primary argument raised by Kuzara. The court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-4\">[E]ven though, in conducting a dissolution pursuant to OCGA \u00a7 14-11-603, the statute requires the court to look to the substantive terms of the Operating Agreement to see if the LLC can still function effectively, this <em>statutory </em>requirement does not change the fact that dissolution proceedings are an exclusive outgrowth of that statute rather than the Operating Agreement....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b459-5\"><em>Id. </em>at n 1. Other state courts have decided that good policy requires that an Application for Judicial Dissolution be resolved by a district court even where an arbitration clause exists. <em>See River Links at Deer Creek, LLC v. Joseph Melz, </em>108 S.W. 3d 855, 861 (Tenn. App. 2002)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>.</p>\n<p id=\"A5A\">\u00b613  Because the Gordons sought judicial dissolution pursuant to \u00a735-8-902, MCA, and because the Half Breed OA makes no reference to judicial dissolution, we conclude that the District Court properly denied Kuzara\u2019s Motion to Compel Arbitration.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-6\">\u00b614 We affirm.</p>\n<judges id=\"b459-7\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES WHEAT, COTTER and RICE concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b456-9\"> In <em>Martz, </em>\u00b6 17, we stated that \u201cthe United States Supreme Court made cled that arbitration, not court, is the proper forum for challenges to contracts as a who| where those contracts contain arbitration provisions.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b459-8\"> A Tennessee court of appeals held that, \u201cwhere only a few of the issues between e parties are subject to arbitration, a comprehensive resolution of the dispute cannot obtained an arbitration <em>Id. </em>the court reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"pAn9\">An arbitrator dealing with the complex facts of this case would have no guidance on the proper interpretation of the Limited Liability Company Act, and would have to expend a great deal of time and energy to reach a well-considered conclusion, but his ultimate decision would have no precedential value.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
