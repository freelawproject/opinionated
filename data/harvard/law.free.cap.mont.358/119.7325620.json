(\u2018CMC\u201d) and F.L. Dye Company. The jury also found CMC was negligent in its work for DiMarzio and awarded damages to DiMarzio. DiMarzio also appeals certain evidentiary rulings. CMC cross-appeals the denial of most of its attorney\u2019s fees. F.L. Dye cross-appeals the denial of prejudgment interest. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-12\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b142-13\">\u00b62 DiMarzio wanted to add a new kitchen and a glass atrium to his home in Bozeman, Montana, and hired CMC as a general contractor for the project on May 14, 2003. F.L. Dye was hired to install the air conditioning and humidification systems at DiMarzio\u2019s home. During <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>the course of the project, disputes arose between DiMarzio, CMC, and F.L. Dye about the quality of the work and air conditioning and humidification systems. These disputes resulted in the termination of the business relationships between CMC, F.L. Dye, and DiMarzio in the spring of 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-4\">\u00b63 In October 2004, DiMarzio filed suit against CMC and F.L. Dye.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In his Amended Complaint, DiMarzio alleged CMC was negligent and breached its contract with him by failing to perform its work in a workmanlike manner and by its failure to properly supervise subcontractors, including F.L. Dye. DiMarzio alleged F.L. Dye was negligent in the design and installation of the air conditioning and humidification systems. CMC filed a counter-claim against DiMarzio for breach of contract. F.L. Dye filed a counter-claim against DiMarzio for breach of contract and unjust enrichment.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">\u00b64 Pursuant to the District Court\u2019s scheduling order, DiMarzio timely filed the expert disclosure of Kevin Amende. In June 2007, nearly six months after the District Court\u2019s expert disclosure deadline, DiMarzio filed what he titled a \u2018Supplemental Expert Disclosure\u201d of William Lynch. F.L. Dye moved to strike the supplement as untimely (after the disclosure deadline) and because it was filed without leave of court (the disclosure was not made pursuant to a motion). DiMarzio responded that new information had been discovered and he was required to supplement, and that since there was no trial date, final pretrial order, or mediation, F.L. Dye was not surprised or prejudiced. DiMarzio also moved the District Court to amend the scheduling order to permit him to use Lynch at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-6\">\u00b65 In a November 21, 2007, order, the District Court denied DiMarzio\u2019s request to amend the scheduling order, reserved judgment on the motion to strike, and offered to consider whether Lynch could testify to new matters as a rebuttal witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-7\">\u00b66 In response to the District Court\u2019s invitation, DiMarzio moved to substitute Lynch for Amende because Amende developed a conflict with DiMarzio and refused to testify at trial. On February 15, 2008, the District Court issued an order refusing to substitute Lynch for Amende and precluding DiMarzio from calling Lynch during his case in chief, but allowing DiMarzio to call Lynch as a rebuttal witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-8\">\u00b67 On May 13,2009, DiMarzio again moved the District Court for an order allowing him to call Lynch during his case in chief. The District <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>Court was not persuaded to alter its prior ruling and DiMarzio\u2019s motion was again denied by order dated June 26, 2009.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-4\">\u00b68 The case was tried before a jury from August 25, 2009, through September 1, 2009. The jury found as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b144-5\">On DiMarzio\u2019s claims: CMC did not breach the contract, but CMC was negligent and awarded DiMarzio $7,902.44. F.L. Dye was not negligent;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b144-6\">On CMC\u2019s counter-claims: DiMarzio breached the contract and awarded CMC $5,361.78;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b144-7\">On F.L. Dye\u2019s counter-claims: DiMarzio breached the contract and awarded F.L. Dye $10,740.00, but DiMarzio was not unjustly enriched.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b144-8\">\u00b69 After the verdict, CMC requested attorney\u2019s fees and F.L. Dye requested prejudgment interest. The District Court awarded CMC attorney\u2019s fees for time spent on the contract claim only. CMC appeals from this order. The District Court denied F.L. Dye\u2019s request for prejudgment interest, concluding F.L. Dye\u2019s right to damages did not vest until the jury returned its verdict as to whether a contract existed between F.L. Dye and DiMarzio. F.L. Dye appeals from this order.</p>\n<p id=\"A-k\">\u00b610 We restate the issues as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b144-9\">\u00b611 DiMarzio raises the following issues on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b144-10\">\u00b612 Issue 1: Did the District Court abuse its discretion when it refused to allow DiMarzio to call William Lynch as an expert during his case in chief?</p>\n<p id=\"b144-11\">\u00b613 Issue 2: Did the District Court err when it denied DiMarzio\u2019s motion for directed verdict and allowed the jury to consider whether a contract existed between DiMarzio and F.L.

DiMarzio timely disclosed expert witness, Kevin Amende. On June 20, 2007, DiMarzio filed a \u2018Supplemental Expert Disclosure\u201d which, in reality, disclosed an entirely new expert, William Lynch. Amende developed a conflict with DiMarzio and would not testify at trial; therefore, DiMarzio sought to replace Amende with Lynch. Because of the untimely disclosure of the new expert Lynch, the District Court did not allow DiMarzio to call Lynch in his case in chief, but allowed Lynch to testify in rebuttal.</p>\n<p id=\"AqZ\">\u00b626 DiMarzio alleges the District Court erred in refusing to allow Lynch to testify as an expert in his case in chief because there was no prejudice to F.L. Dye, and DiMarzio was not allowed to present the complete story to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-10\">\u00b627 The trial court is vested with <em>great </em>latitude in ruling on the admissibility of expert testimony. <em>Nelson v. Nelson, </em>2005 MT 263, \u00b6 31, 329 Mont. 85, 122 P.3d 1196 (emphasis in original). The district court has the authority to exclude expert testimony when the expert witness was not properly disclosed. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 32; <em>First Citizens Bank v. Sullivan, </em>2008 MT 428, \u00b6 29, 347 Mont. 452, 200 P.3d 39. This Court views \u201cwith favor\u201d sanctions for failure to comply with the rules of discovery. <em>Seal v. Woodrows Pharmacy, </em>1999 MT 247, \u00b6 22, 296 Mont. 197, 988 P.2d 1230.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-11\">\u00b628 Absent a showing that the district court abused its discretion, this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>Court will not overturn a district court\u2019s decision on the admissibility of evidence, including expert testimony. <em>Nelson, </em>\u00b6 31; <em>Sunburst, </em>\u00b6 68. A district court abuses its discretion when it acts \u201carbitrarily without employment of conscientious judgment or exceed[s] the bounds of reason resulting in substantial injustice.\u201d <em>Circle S Seeds of Montana, Inc. v. T &amp; M Transporting, Inc., </em>2006 MT 25, \u00b6 14, 331 Mont. 76, 130 P.3d 150.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-4\">\u00b629 The District Court did not err when it refused to allow Lynch to testify in DiMarzio\u2019s case in chief. DiMarzio\u2019s disclosure of Lynch as an expert witness was not proper as it did not comply with the District Court\u2019s scheduling order. The District Court did not act arbitrarily nor did it exceed the bounds of reason. It considered the issue thoroughly and on several occasions -in November 2007, February 2008, and June 2009. The District Court acted within its wide discretion in precluding Lynch\u2019s testimony during DiMarzio\u2019s case in chief but allowing it during rebuttal. <em>Nelson, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 32-34; <em>First Citizens Bank, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 29-32.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">\u00b630 <em>Issue 2: Did the District Court err when it denied DiMarzio\u2019s motion for directed verdict and allowed the jury to consider whether a contract existed between DiMarzio and F.L. Dye?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b146-6\">\u00b631 The jury found that DiMarzio had a contract with F.L. Dye regarding the air conditioning and humidification systems, and that DiMarzio breached that contract. DiMarzio maintains it was CMC who was responsible for hiring all subcontractors, such as F.L. Dye, and any contract was between CMC and F.L. Dye. He alleges that all billing went through CMC and that he paid CMC for F.L. Dye\u2019s work.</p>\n<p id=\"A4U\">\u00b632 F.L. Dye contends that the contract was with DiMarzio. At trial, F.L. Dye\u2019s representative, Schaeffer, testified that the contract was with CMC. CMC\u2019s representative, Keyes, testified that CMC hired F. L. Dye. However, F.L. Dye also introduced evidence that it presented DiMarzio with an offer to install the air conditioning and humidification systems and that DiMarzio accepted by signing two proposals. Additionally, there was evidence that DiMarzio contacted F. L. Dye personally to discuss F. L. Dye\u2019s ongoing work on the project.</p>\n<p id=\"AFg\">\u00b633 DiMarzio moved for a directed verdict on the issue of whether a contract existed between him and F.L. Dye. The motion was based upon the testimony of Schaeffer and Keyes that the contract was between CMC and F. L. Dye. The District Court denied DiMarzio\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-7\">\u00b634 Motions for directed verdict are properly granted when there is a complete absence of any evidence to warrant submission to a jury, such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>evidence and all inferences being considered in the light most favorable to the party opposing the motion. <em>Allison v. Town of Clyde Park, </em>2000 MT 267, \u00b6 27, 302 Mont. 55, 11 P.3d 544.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-3\">\u00b635  The District Court did not err in denying DiMarzio\u2019s motion for directed verdict. Drawing all inferences in favor of F.L. Dye, the party opposing DiMarzio\u2019s motion, it was proper to submit the contract issue to the jury. While Schaeffer testified the contract was between CMC and F. L. Dye, other evidence presented supported F. L. Dye\u2019s theory that the contract was between it and DiMarzio, which is precisely what the jury found. Because of the conflicting evidence presented at trial, it cannot be said that there was a complete absence of any evidence to warrant submitting the contract issue to the jury. The District Court properly denied DiMarzio\u2019s motion for directed verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-4\">\u00b636 <em>Issue 3: Did the District Court err in instructing the jury?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">\u00b637 The giving of jury instructions is reviewed for an abuse of discretion. <em>Vincent, </em>\u00b6 14; <em>Edie, </em>\u00b6 12. A district court abuses its discretion when it acts \u201carbitrarily without employment of conscientious judgment or exceed[s] the bounds of reason\u201d resulting in substantial injustice. <em>Clark v. Bell, </em>2009 MT 390, \u00b6 16, 353 Mont. 331, 220 P.3d 650. District courts are given \u201cgreat leeway\u201d in instructing the jury. <em>Vincent, </em>\u00b6 14 <em>(citing Payne v. Knutson, </em>2004 MT 271, \u00b6 14, 323 Mont. 165, 99 P.3d 200). In reviewing whether a particular jury instruction was properly given or refused, we consider the instruction in its entirety and in connection with the other instructions given and the evidence presented at trial. <em>Vincent, </em>\u00b6 14; <em>Kiely Constr., LLC v. City of Red Lodge, </em>2002 MT 241, \u00b6 62, 312 Mont. 52, 57 P.3d 836. \u2018The party assigning error to a district court\u2019s instruction must show prejudice in order to prevail, and prejudice will not be found if the jury instructions in their entirety state the applicable law of the case.\u201d <em>Kiely, </em>\u00b6 62.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-6\">\u00b638 The jury was given three instructions to which DiMarzio objects: Instruction numbers 22, 23, and 24. Instruction 22 states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b147-7\">An agreement may be established by the conduct of the parties without any words being expressed in writing or orally, if, from such conduct, it appears that the parties mutually intended to agree on all the terms. The same elements are essential to an implied contract as are essential to an express contract.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b147-8\">\u00b639 DiMarzio objected to this instruction, arguing it was unsupported by the evidence and inconsistent with F.L. Dye\u2019s unjust enrichment claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>\u00b640 DiMarzio\u2019s argument regarding Instruction 22 is essentially the same as his argument regarding the denial of his motion for directed verdict. Because the evidence presented at trial was conflicting on the issue of whether there was a contract between DiMarzio and F.L. Dye, giving Instruction 22 was not an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-4\">\u00b641 Instruction 23 states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-5\">Performance by a contractor of a construction contract in accordance with the provisions of a contract entitles a contractor to payment from the owner.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b148-6\">\u00b642 DiMarzio objected, and argues that this instruction \u201cunfairly prejudiced\u201d him by giving the jury \u201cthe incorrect impression that contractors have some higher status than owners\u201d in breach of contract cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-7\">\u00b643 The District Court did not err in giving Instruction 23. It was for the jury to decide whether the contractor had performed or not, and was entitled to payment or not. The instructions, read as a whole, adequately state the law applicable to this case. Instruction 23 favored neither party, and DiMarzio has shown no prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-8\">\u00b644 Instruction 24 states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-9\">A subcontractor is a person who is hired to produce a specific result but who is not subject to the right of control of the general contractor as to the way he brings about that result. Generally, a person who hires an independent contractor is not liable for his actions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b148-10\">\u00b645 DiMarzio objected that Instruction 24 was contrary to CMC\u2019s testimony, misleading, and an improper comment on the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"AVB\">\u00b646 The District Court did not err in giving Instruction 24. Conflicting evidence was presented at trial about who hired F.L. Dye. It cannot be said, on the record before the Court, that giving this instruction was an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-11\">\u00b647 <em>Issue 4: Did the District Court err in denying most of CMC\u2019s attorney\u2019s fees?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b148-12\">\u00b648 After the jury returned its verdict, CMC moved for attorney\u2019s fees claiming it was the prevailing party. The contract between CMC and DiMarzio provided \u201c[i]n the event any dispute arises between the parties to this agreement, the prevailing party shall be entitled to their costs and attorney\u2019s fees.\u201d The District Court determined that CMC was the prevailing party and was entitled to attorney\u2019s fees, but only on the contract claim. A hearing was held December 17, 2009, to determine the amount and reasonableness of attorney\u2019s fees related to the contract claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>\u00b649 CMC and DiMarzio agreed that it was impossible to segregate the attorney\u2019s fees between the contract and negligence claims. CMC argued that because it was impossible to separate fees related to the contract claim from the negligence claim, and because CMC was the prevailing party, it was therefore entitled to all its attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"A_m\">\u00b650 However, the District Court found that because CMC\u2019s insurer defended the action and was only obligated to defend the negligence claim, a majority of the attorney\u2019s fees were for the negligence claim. Additionally, the District Court denied a majority of CMC\u2019s attorney\u2019s fees on equitable grounds, stating that if CMC or its insurer recovered the attorney\u2019s fees, they would receive a windfall.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-3\">\u00b651 CMC renews its argument on appeal, urging that because the attorney\u2019s fees could not be segregated between the negligence and contract claims, and because it was the prevailing party, it should have been awarded all its attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-4\">\u00b652 The award of attorney\u2019s fees is reviewed for an abuse of discretion. <em>Tacke, </em>\u00b6 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">\u00b653 The District Court did not abuse its discretion when determining the amount of attorney\u2019s fees to award CMC. While CMC is correct that the district court is bound by the contract between CMC and DiMarzio which entitles the prevailing party to attorney\u2019s fees, <em>Doig v. Cascaddan, </em>282 Mont. 105, 112, 935 P.2d 268, 272 (1997), that does not mean CMC is entitled to <em>all </em>attorney\u2019s fees. The reasonable amount of attorney\u2019s fees awarded is left to the discretion of the district court. <em>See Plath v. Schonrock, </em>2003 MT 21, \u00b6 40, 314 Mont. 101, 64 P.3d 984. What constitutes reasonable attorney\u2019s fees is for the district court to determine under the facts of each case. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 36. An award of attorney\u2019s fees must be based on competent evidence. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 39. Tn a lawsuit involving multiple claims or multiple theories, an award of attorney\u2019s fees must be based on the time spent by the prevailing party\u2019s attorney on the claim or theory under which attorney fees are allowable.\u201d <em>Emmerson v. Walker, </em>2010 MT 167, \u00b6 32, 357 Mont. 166, 236 P.3d 598.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">\u00b654  The District Court found CMC was entitled to attorney\u2019s fees, as required by the contract. Then, it thoroughly considered the amount of attorney\u2019s fees to award. It held a hearing and considered testimony and evidence submitted by the parties. It considered the seven <em>Plath </em>factors and noted that <em>Plath </em>allows the court to consider other factors. It found that based upon the unique circumstances of this case (CMC\u2019s insurer paid most of the attorney\u2019s fees), it was reasonable to award only a portion of the attorney\u2019s fees CMC sought. The district court has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>such discretion - what constitutes reasonable attorney\u2019s fees is for the district court to determine under the facts of each case. <em>Plath, </em>\u00b6 36. The District Court determined that only a portion of the fees sought were reasonable. Considering all the evidence of record, the District Court acted within its discretion in awarding partial attorney\u2019s fees to CMC based upon the particular circumstances of the case before it.</p>\n<p id=\"Aqx\">\u00b655 <em>Issue 5: Did the District Court err when it denied F.L. Dye\u2019s request for prejudgment interest?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b150-4\">\u00b656 F.L. Dye sought prejudgment interest on the jury\u2019s award of $10,740.00, the exact amount of two unpaid invoices it previously submitted to DiMarzio. The District Court denied F.L. Dye prejudgment interest, finding that F.L. Dye\u2019s right to recover did not vest until the day the jury returned its verdict. F.L. Dye appeals, arguing that its right to recover vested on the date of the last unpaid invoice.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">\u00b657 The decision to grant or deny prejudgment interest is reviewed to determine whether the district court correctly interpreted the law. <em>Swank, </em>\u00b6 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-6\">\u00b658  A party is entitled to prejudgment interest when three criteria are met: (1) the existence of an underlying monetary obligation; (2) the amount of recovery is certain or capable of being made certain by calculation; and (3) the right to recover the obligation vests on a particular day.

Petroleum, </em>\u00b6 99. We have consistently refused to award prejudgment interest when the amount of damages due upon breach of contract was not clearly ascertainable until determined by the trial court. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 100.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-8\">\u00b660  The District Court did not err when it refused to award prejudgment interest. At issue was first, whether a contract even existed between F. L. Dye and DiMarzio; second, if so, whether DiMarzio breached the contract; and third, if there was a breach, whether F. L. Dye was damaged and in what amount. Contrary to F.L. Dye\u2019s assertion, this was not an action for the definite unpaid balance of a contract. Until the jury returned its verdict, neither party knew if a contract even existed, let alone a certain sum of damages. <em>See Carriger v. Ballenger, </em>192 Mont. 479, 486, 628 P.2d 1106, 1110 (1981). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>The District Court correctly found F.L.
