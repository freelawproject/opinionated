Baillie\u2019s (Baillie) bo dock rights located on Bigfork Harbor on Flathead Lake. The questioi] Ehrman presented to KVHR was one of contract interpretation. I: 1991, Baillie had reserved the dock rights in a Contract for Deed whe: he sold the property where the dock was located. The Contract fo| Deed reserved use of the dock and access to it to Baillie and his heirs The Contract for Deed also provided that, subject to the terms of th| agreement, either party could assign his or her interest and neith party could unreasonably withhold consent to such assignment.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-16\">\u00b64 Ehrman was not Baillie\u2019s heir and was specifically concerned wi whether he could acquire Baillie\u2019s dock rights under the Contract fd Deed. James Ramlow (Ramlow), a KVHR attorney, advised Ehrma <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>that he could acquire the dock rights, despite his non-heir status, and drafted a \u2018Lease and Agreement for Assignment of Easement to Boat Dock\u201d (\u201cAgreement\u201d). Under the Agreement, Ehrman would lease Baillie\u2019s dock rights until Baillie obtained consent to assign, upon which Ehrman would acquire the dock rights. Ehrman and Baillie executed the Agreement in June 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-3\">\u00b65 Over the next one and a half years, Ehrman made lease payments and enjoyed use of the dock without incident. However, in late 2003 or early 2004, William G. Myers, Jr. (Myers), a subsequent purchaser of the property, informed Ehrman that he would never consent to assignment of the dock rights. His actions prompted Ehrman to record the Agreement in July 2004. Myers proceeded to harass Ehrman whenever he or his guests used the dock.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-4\">\u00b66 In July 2005, Myers\u2019 attorney contacted Ramlow and arranged a meeting. After the meeting, Ramlow wrote to Ehrman, informing him that Myers disputed Baillie\u2019s ability to transfer his dock rights to anyone other than one of his heirs, but that Myers was willing to enter into a new lease agreement with Ehrman. In a subsequent letter to Ehrman, dated September 6, 2005, Ramlow advised Ehrman of his options:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b543-5\">Your options are to do nothing and defend your right to the lease and assignment of dock and access rights. That may be costly .... In my experience, it would not be safe to advise you to plan on spending any less than 10,000 to 15,000 for litigation costs. <em>If you win, which I think you will, </em>an appeal by Myers to the Supreme Court could cost an additional 4,000 to 5,000. Another option is to attempt to negotiate a new lease with Myers .... Before negotiating, I think that some letter should be sent to his attorney challenging Myers\u2019 refusal to give consent to the lease and assignment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">(Emphasis added.) Ehrman elected to defend the Agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-7\">\u00b67 In 2006, Myers and other owners of the property sued Ehrman, seeking a declaratory judgment that Ehrman had no interest in the dock rights. Both parties filed motions for summary judgment. In August 2007, the district court ruled against Ehrman, concluding that the dock rights were only reserved to Baillie and his heirs, and it was not unreasonable, as a matter of law, for the property owners to refuse [to consent to the assignment of the dock rights to a non-heir.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-8\">!\u00b68 KVHR subsequently withdrew from representing Ehrman. [Ehrman hired his current counsel and chose not to appeal the declaratory judgment. Instead, Ehrman sued KVHR for legal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>malpractice in April 2008. In March 2010, the District Court granted KVHR\u2019s motion for summary judgment, concluding the lawsuit was barred by the applicable three year statute of limitations. Consequently, the lawsuit was dismissed with prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-4\">\u00b69 The sole issue on appeal is whether the District Court erred in determining that Ehrman\u2019s legal malpractice claim was barred by the three year statute of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b544-6\">\u00b610 We review a district court\u2019s summary judgment ruling de novo, applying the same M. R. Civ. P. 56 criteria used by the district court. <em>Watkins Trust v. Lacosta, </em>2004 MT 144, \u00b6 16, 321 Mont. 432, 92 P.3d 620. Summary judgment is appropriate only when no genuine issue of material fact exists and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. M. R. Civ. P. 56(c). Once the moving party accomplishes I this, the burden shifts to the opposing party to prove, by more than mere denial and speculation, that a genuine issue of material fact exists and that the moving party is not entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>Spolar v. Datsopoulos, 2003 </em>MT 54, \u00b6 11, 314 Mont. 364, 66 P.3d 284.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b544-8\">\u00b611 Section 27-2-206, MCA, provides the statute of limitations for a legal malpractice action:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-9\">An action against an attorney licensed to practice law in Montana or a paralegal assistant or a legal intern employed by an attorney) based upon the person\u2019s alleged professional negligent act or fo: error or omission in the person\u2019s practice must be commence within 3 years after the plaintiff discovers or through the use o: reasonable diligence should have discovered the act, error, o: omission, whichever occurs last, but in no case may the action b commenced after 10 years from the date of the act, error, o: omission.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b544-10\">\u00b612 Further, we have held that the statute of limitations does na begin to run until both the \u201cdiscovery rule\u201d and \u201caccrual rule\u201d are satisfied. <em>Watkins Trust, </em>\u00b6 40. The discovery rule begins the statute o: limitations when the plaintiff discovers or should have discovered tin negligent act. <em>Johnson v. Barrett, </em>1999 MT 176, \u00b6 11, 295 Mont. 254 983 P.2d 925. The statute of limitations does not begin to run unde: the accrual rule until all elements of the claim have occurred. <em>Uhler Doak, </em>268 Mont. 191, 196, 885 P.2d 1297, 1300 (1994). Thus, \u201cth( <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>statute of limitations in a legal malpractice action does not begin to run until the negligent act was, or should have been, discovered, <em>and </em>all elements of the legal malpractice claim, including damages, have occurred.\u201d <em>Watkins Trust, </em>\u00b6 40.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-3\">\u00b613 The District Court determined Ehrman was aware of the facts forming the basis of the malpractice allegation no later than July 2004 because he knew a problem existed with the Agreement (Myers and the other property owners were not going to consent to the assignment of the dock rights); therefore, the statute of limitations had already run when he filed suit in 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-4\">\u00b614 On appeal, Ehrman argues that the statute of limitations did not begin to run until August 2007 when the district court granted summary judgment to Myers and the other property owners. Ehrman asserts the discovery rule does not bar his claim because he justifiably relied on his attorney\u2019s advice, and the attorney-client fiduciary relationship excuses earlier discovery of the negligent act. He also argues his claim is not barred by the accrual rule because he did not suffer any actual injury until August 2007. KVHR maintains that by July 2004, Ehrman was aware of facts sufficient to put him on inquiry notice of a potential claim. KVHR further argues that Ehrman accrued damages-denial of quiet enjoyment of his dock rights-in 2004, when Myers began harassing Ehrman and his guests.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">\n<em>A. Discovery Rule</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b545-6\">15 The existence of a fiduciary relationship, such as that of attorney nd client, may excuse the discovery of an attorney\u2019s alleged negligent ct and toll the statute of limitations. <em>Estate of Watkins v. Hedman, </em>2004 MT 143, \u00b6\u00b6 18-21, 321 Mont. 419, 91 P.3d 1264. In <em>Estate of 'atkins, </em>Carolyn Watkins retained attorney Lacosta to prepare an state plan for Carolyn and her husband Stanley. As part of the estate Ian, Lacosta prepared a trust that she advised Carolyn was revocable [pursuant to Carolyn\u2019s wishes that she retain flexibility in managing ssets) when, in fact, it became irrevocable upon Stanley\u2019s death in 992. Lacosta continued to advise Carolyn the trust was revocable ntil 1995, when Carolyn was advised by another attorney that it was revocable, and Lacosta admitted it was irrevocable. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6\u00b6 4-9.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-7\">16 Given the confidential relationship that existed between Carolyn d Lacosta, we excused her delayed discovery of the negligent act and included the statute of limitations was tolled until 1995 when arolyn discovered the trust was irrevocable. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 34. We noted at Carolyn\u2019s mistake was her reliance on Lacosta\u2019s advice. However, e was entitled to trust her attorney\u2019s advice. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 21. In reaching <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>our conclusion, we noted what the United States Supreme Court observed long ago:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-4\">There are few of the business relations of life involving a higher trust and confidence than that of attorney and client... and it is the duty of the court... to be watchful and industrious, to see that confidence thus reposed shall not be used to the detriment or prejudice of the rights of the party bestowing it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b546-5\"><em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 19 (quoting <em>Stockton v. Ford, </em>52 U.S. 232, 247, _ S. Ct. _ (1851)).</p>\n<p id=\"b546-7\">\u00b617  Lawsuits are based upon different interpretations of law and fact, and a client is entitled to rely on the advice of his or his attorney. In the midst of representation, a client should not be required to sue his or her attorney for malpractice merely because the opposing party has presented countervailing arguments. However, a client\u2019s right to rely on his or her attorney\u2019s advice is not absolute, and delayec discovery is only excused until the client reasonably believes that he or she is no longer being competently represented. <em>See id. </em>at \u00b6\u00b6 18-21 Thus, there is not an absolute rule for determining when the discovery rule is triggered. The determination of when a client knew or shoulc have known that his or her attorney\u2019s advice was negligent is a fact intensive inquiry particular to each case.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-8\">\u00b618 Turning to the facts of this particular case, we conclude Ehrmai did not know, nor should he have known, of KVHR\u2019s alleged negligen act until August 2007. Ehrman testified he wholly relied on Ramlow\u2019 advice throughout the course of his representation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-9\">All I ever did was listen to my attorneys.... I\u2019m smart enough know I don\u2019t know the law, so I get the best counsel I can an! listen to what they have to say.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-10\">There was never any question in my mind until the day that \u2019 lost the summary judgment that we weren\u2019t going to win thi| thing. I was assured by them that [Myers and the other proper owners] just hadn\u2019t read far enough. ... When I\u2019d call and talk <em>\\ </em>[Ramlow], he\u2019d say, No. Don\u2019t worry about it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b546-11\">\u00b619  Here, Myers\u2019 countervailing interpretation of the underlyinl Contract for Deed and challenges to the Agreement were insufiicieif to put Ehrman on notice of an alleged negligent act and trigger tl discovery rule. It was reasonable for Ehrman to rely upon Ramios advice until summary judgment was entered against him in Augul 2007. At that time, he was clearly on notice that the advice he hq received was incorrect and the Agreement was void.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-2\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>\n<em>B. Accrual Rule</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b547-3\">\u00b620  In <em>TJhler, </em>we held that all elements of a claim must have accrued in order for the statute of limitations to begin running:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b547-4\">[T]o establish a cause of action for legal malpractice, there must be a showing that the attorney owed his client a duty of care, that there was a breach of this duty by a failure to use reasonable care and skill, <em>and that the breach was the proximate cause of the client\u2019s injury and resulted in damages.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">268 Mont. at 196, 885 P.2d at 1300 (quoting <em>Merzlak v. Purcell, </em>252 Mont. 527, 529-30, 830 P.2d 1278, 1279-80 (1992)) (emphasis added). The accrual rule is based on the rationale that It is inherently illogical and unfair to require a plaintiff to file an action prior to the accrual of the cause of action because if a plaintiff filed suit when no actual damages had been sustained, the suit would properly be dismissed.\u201d <em>Watkins Trust, </em>\u00b6 49. Further, actual damages, not the mere threat of future damages, are required to begin the running of the statute of limitations under the accrual rule. <em>Id. </em>Additionally, in <em>Spolar, </em>we determined that although the client had been voicing his objections for over one year to the valuation method his attorney used in preparing proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law for the division of the client\u2019s marital estate, his claim did not accrue until the district court issued its order dividing the marital estate. <em>Spolar, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 5-7, 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-6\">\u00b621  Similarly in this case, Ehrman\u2019s damages did not accrue until the district court declared the Agreement null and void, enjoined Ehrman from using the dock, and quieted title in favor of Myers and other property owners. If, as the District Court concluded, rman\u2019s damages had accrued in July 2004, he would have had to sue malpractice when he still had possession of and was using the dock hts-before he sustained any damages arising from Ramlow\u2019s erpretation of the Contract for Deed. Because the matter in dispute s related to the interpretation of a contract, and because Ehrman s not deprived of the possession or use of the dock rights until gust 2007, we conclude his claim against KVHR did not accrue until it point.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-8\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b547-9\"><em>2 </em>Reversed and remanded for further proceedings consistent with s Opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b547-10\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES NELSON, LEAPHART i MORRIS concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b547-11\">JUSTICE RICE,</author>\n<p id=\"Ast\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>\u00b623 I believe the Court overlooks critical facts, ignores controlling cases, and essentially adopts the \u201ccontinuous representation\u201d doctrine we expressly rejected in earlier cases as inconsistent with our statute.</p>\n<p id=\"AAY\">\u00b624 We reached the opposite conclusion from the Court\u2019s holding today in the very similar case of <em>Peschel v. Jones, </em>232 Mont. 516, 525-26, 760 P.2d 51, 56-57 (1988), and provided specific guidance about application of the discovery rule. There, the lawyer drafted an agreement for the purpose of resolving financing problems so that construction of the client\u2019s apartment complex could continue. <em>Peschel, </em>232 Mont. at 518, 760 P.2d at 52. The agreement was entered in November 1979 and construction resumed in December 1979. <em>Peschel, 232 </em>Mont. at 518, 760 P.2d at 52. Ultimately, the agreement did not resolve matters and litigation between the client and the other contract party ensued. <em>Peschel, </em>232 Mont. at 518, 525, 760 P.2d at 52, 56. The other party obtained a $72,000 judgment against the client, Peschel, in January 1984. <em>Peschel, </em>232 Mont. at 525, 760 P.2d at 56. Peschel then filed sui1 against his former attorney, Jones, in November 1985. <em>Peschel, </em>232 Mont. at 518, 760 P.2d at 52. Peschel argued-^ust as Ehrman argues-that 'he did not discover the facts essential to a cause of action until after January 25, 1984, when a district court decision founc judgment for Martin Development and against Peschel in the amoun of $72,000.\u201d <em>Peschel, </em>232 Mont. at 525, 760 P.2d at 56.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-4\">\u00b625 We rejected Peschel\u2019s argument. Noting Peschel\u2019s assertion tha \u2018he had knowledge of the acts, but did not have knowledge of th&lt; alleged negligence,\u201d <em>Peschel, </em>232 Mont. at 525, 760 P.2d at 56, w explained that it was knowledge of the <em>facts </em>which was critical-no-knowledge of a viable malpractice theory:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-5\">As a matter of law, what is critical in determining when a leg; malpractice action accrues is <em>knowledge of the facts essential to th\\ cause of action, not knowledge of the legal theories </em>upon which a: action may be brought.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-6\"><em>[I]t is the knowledge of facts rather than discovery of legal theory that is the test. The test is whether the plaintiff has information </em>&lt; <em>circumstances sufficient to put a reasonable person on inquiry, </em>&lt; has the opportunity to obtain knowledge from sources open to hj or her investigation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b548-7\"><em>Peschel, </em>232 Mont. at 525, 760 P.2d at 56 (emphases added, intern! quotation marks omitted) (quoting <em>Burgett v. Flaherty, </em>204 Mont. 16 173-74, 663 P.2d 332, 334 (1983)). Thus, the \u201ctest\u201d for determinir whether the plaintiff-client \u201cshould have discovered\u201d the problem : <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>\u201cwhether the plaintiff has information of circumstances sufficient to put a reasonable person on inquiry.\u201d <em>Peschel, </em>232 Mont. at 525, 760 P.2d at 56.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-3\">\u00b626 In <em>Guest v. McLaverty, </em>2006 MT 150, \u00b6\u00b6 5, 13, 332 Mont. 421, 138 P.3d 812, we held that plaintiffs legal malpractice claim was time barred, and consistently applied the rules discussed in Peschel:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b549-4\">One has discovered, or through the use of reasonable diligence should have discovered, the act, error, or omission, <em>when one has information of circumstances sufficient to put a reasonable person on inquiry regarding the act or omission. Johnson v. Barrett, </em>1999 MT 176, \u00b6 11, 295 Mont. 254, \u00b6 11, 983 P.2d 925, \u00b6 11. This test requires knowledge of the facts essential to the legal malpractice claim, rather than the discovery of legal theories. <em>Johnson, </em>\u00b6 11. Specifically, the court determines whether the plaintiff had \u201cthe opportunity to obtain knowledge from sources open to his or her investigation at that time or shortly thereafter[.]\u201d <em>Johnson, </em>\u00b6 15 (internal quotation omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b549-5\"><em>Guest, </em>\u00b6 5 (emphasis added). As in <em>Peschel, </em>we rejected Guest\u2019s argument that he Tacked the legal expertise to know he may have had a malpractice claim\u201d any earlier, noting that this was Irrelevant\u201d to the proper analysis. <em>Guest, </em>\u00b6 8 (citing <em>Johnson, </em>\u00b6 11). We stated that \u2018Guest\u2019s contention that the statute of limitations cannot begin to run until he \u2018realized the acts and omissions complained of constituted legal malpractice!,]\u2019 is incorrect.\u201d <em>Guest, </em>\u00b6 8. Likewise, the Court\u2019s conclusion here that \u2018Ehrman did not know, nor should he have known, of KVHR\u2019s alleged negligent act until August 2007\u201d is clearly incorrect. Opinion, \u00b6 18. In August 2007 Ehrman learned that he had lost before the district court and that his attorney may have committed malpractice; but long before August 2007 he clearly knew of the facts-of the actions taken by bis attorney. The Court\u2019s reasoning implies that until August 2007, when the District Court ruled, the facts putting Ehrman on inquiry could not have been known.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-6\">\u00b627 The precise issue under our law is when Ehrman had \u2018information [of circumstances sufficient to put a reasonable person on inquiry\u201d [concerning his attorney\u2019s advice, not when he became aware that he bad a viable malpractice claim. <em>Guest, </em>\u00b6 5; <em>Peschel, </em>232 Mont. at 525, 760 P.2d at 56. Ehrman had more than enough information to put a reasonable person on inquiry about his attorney\u2019s actions long before \u25a0August 2007-he had it more than 3 years before his filed suit against KVHR. The Court overlooks many of these critical facts in its analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>\u00b628 KVHR prepared the lease agreement for Ehrman which was signed in June 2002. Over three years lapsed before Ehrman again sought counsel from KVHR, during which time KVHR heard nothing about the situation and took no action. However, much happened with Ehrman during this hiatus. As the Court notes, in late 2003 or early 2004, new owner Myers told Ehrman he would never consent to assignment of the dock rights to Ehrman and began to harass Ehrman and his guests when they used the dock. At that point, in July 2004, over two years after KVHR\u2019s latest involvement, Ehrman took action for himself by recording his lease agreement, a fact the Court ignores. Ehrman acknowledges that he was aware by this time that Myers was never going to provide consent. And then, as Ehrman testified in his deposition, \u2018things got crazy\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-4\">A. ...When [Myers] found out I got it recorded, then things got crazy. Then he was harassing us. He was taking pictures of-Every time we\u2019d take the boat out he was there with his camera taking pictures and making threats and all kinds of things. He was really hot and mad, but that didn\u2019t happen until about the time I recorded the [lease agreement].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-5\">Q. Do you have knowledge that Mr. Myers became aware of your recording and that\u2019s what triggered his hostility?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-6\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-7\">Q. Did he tell you that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-8\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b550-9\">\u00b629 The events over these years would have put a reasonable person \u201con inquiry\u201d that there was a problem with the lease agreement-especially after \u2018things got crazy.\u201dThe lease was premised upon obtaining Myers\u2019 consent and, clearly, that was not going ti happen. Myers said he would never consent to lease of the dock right; to Ehrman and actively opposed Ehrman\u2019s use of the doc' Significantly, all of this occurred during the three years that KVH was not involved in the matter. The Court reasons that \u201c[i]n the mids of representation, a client should not be required to sue his or he: attorney for malpractice merely because the opposing party ha; presented countervailing arguments.\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 17. However, thii] matter was <em>not </em>in litigation when \u2018things got crazy,\u201d and KVHR wai not then actively representing Ehrman. Ehrman, who was handlin; things for himself, including recording the lease, then faced a decisio: with litigation appearing to be necessary, should he go back after three-year hiatus to KVHR, who had written the apparentlj unworkable lease, or should he seek other counsel? Despite being p <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>\u201con inquiry\u201d about a problem, Ehrman returned to KVHR without seeking another opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-3\">\u00b630 The Court relies heavily upon <em>Estate of Watkins v. Hedman, Hileman, &amp; Lacosta, </em>2004 MT 143, 321 Mont. 419, 91 P.3d 1264, but that case is clearly distinguishable from the circumstances here, as we have previously explained. <em>See Guest, </em>\u00b6 9 (citing <em>Watkins Trust v. Lacosta, </em>2004 MT 144, \u00b6\u00b6 12, 43, 321 Mont. 432, 92 P.3d 620).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We rejected Guest\u2019s reliance on <em>Watkins Trust </em>because the 'highly complex\u201d estate and tax planning issues at issue in <em>Watkins Trust </em>would have been \u201c \u2018very difficult for the average layperson to understand.\u2019 \u201d <em>Guest, </em>\u00b6 9 (quoting <em>Watkins Trust, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 12, 43); <em>see also Estate of Watkins, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 9, 22-23. Further, we acknowledged the role of concealment in the <em>Watkins </em>cases. <em>Watkins Trust, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 44-47; <em>Estate of Watkins, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 24-27. Such concealment has not been alleged here, importantly, in <em>Guest </em>we emphasized that, even under <em>Watkins Trust, </em>\u201cthe analysis still focuses on \u2018when the facts should have been mowable[;]\u2019 not when the trustee should have known that a potential malpractice claim existed.\u201d <em>Guest, </em>\u00b6 9 (quoting <em>Watkins Trust, </em>\u00b6 41). The subject matter here was not so complex that Ehrman could not see ;hat there was a problem with the lease, as the facts clearly showed.</p>\n<p id=\"Al2\">\u00b631 In <em>Schneider v. Leaphart, </em>228 Mont. 483, 484-85, 743 P.2d 613, 14 (1987), the lawyer drafted an agreement which was entered in Siovember of1979 and the client learned, at least by December of 1981, ;hat the agreement was apparently in error. Litigation with the other :ontract party ensued, wherein the client was presumably represented y the same lawyer who drafted the agreement. <em>Schneider, </em>228 Mont. at 485, 488, 743 P.2d at 615-16. The court ruled against the client, who ,hen brought a malpractice action against the lawyer in March 1985, ore than three years after learning of the problem with the greement. <em>Schneider, </em>228 Mont. at 485-86, 743 P.2d at 615. The istrict court dismissed the action pursuant to the three-year statute jf limitations. <em>Schneider, </em>228 Mont. at 486, 743 P.2d at 615. On appeal, client, Schneider, urged this Court to adopt the \u201ccontinuous spresentation\u201d doctrine for legal malpractice claims, so that the tatute of limitations would be \u201ctolled until such time as an attorney <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>ceases to represent a plaintiff.\u201d <em>Schneider, </em>228 Mont. at 488, 743 P.2d at 616.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-4\">\u00b632 We rejected Schneider\u2019s argument, concluding that the continuous representation doctrine was inconsistent with \u00a7 27-2-206, MCA, the statute of limitations for legal malpractice actions, and our previous holdings: \u201c[T]his Court has noted that \u2018[sjection 27-2-206, MCA does not suspend accrual until the \u2018attorney-client\u2019 relationship has beer terminated.\u2019 \u201d <em>Schneider, </em>228 Mont. at 488, 743 P.2d at 616-17 (quoting <em>Burgett, </em>204 Mont. at 174, 663 P.2d at 334).</p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">\u00b633 However, the Court today essentially overturns these cases and adopts the continuous representation doctrine-but without explicitly saying so. The Court tolls the statute of limitations on the basis tha1 \u2018Ehrman testified he wholly relied on\u201dhis attorney\u2019s advice. Opinion, \u00b6 18. If all a client must do is assert that he \u201cwholly relied\u201d upon his attorney\u2019s advice in order to toll the statute of limitations, such a lov threshold will result in tolling the statute for every claim, despite th&lt; Court\u2019s assertion that the client\u2019s right to rely upon the attorney\u2019 advice is \u201cnot absolute.\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 17. For all practical purposes, this holding indeed makes the right absolute and adopts the continuoui representation doctrine. Despite stating that this issue will be decide* on a \u2018fact-intensive inquiry particular to each case,\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 17, tha Court ignores all the facts about Ehrman\u2019s actions and knowledge ani simply accepts his statement that he \u201cwholly relied on\u201dhis attorney\u2019* advice. Opinion, \u00b6 18. I</p>\n<p id=\"b552-6\">\u00b634 We adopted the \u2018two-track\u201d approach for criminal defendants ill <em>Ereth v. Cascade County, </em>2003 MT 328, \u00b6 26, 318 Mont. 355, 81 P.3 463. We concluded this approach was superior \u201cbecause it incorporate! a strict reading of the statute of limitations that at the same tim! addresses the problems posed by multiple litigations.\u201d <em>Ereth, </em>\u00b6 26. WH said that \u2018in order to put counsel on notice that he or she will have t! defend against a malpractice claim, and thereby honor the policiJj underlying the statute of limitations, we hold that a criminal defendant must file a malpractice complaint within three years <em>m </em>discovering the act, error or omission.\u201d <em>Ereth, </em>\u00b6 26. The policy reasoiH supporting adoption of the two-track rule in <em>Ereth </em>support the sarrH application of our law here. Further, affirming the District CouB honors \u00a727-2-206, MCA. H</p>\n<p id=\"b552-7\">\u00b635 Lastly, I concur with KVHR\u2019s argument regarding the accruH rule. Ehrman lost the quiet enjoyment of his asserted use privilegH and was thus damaged long before the district court ruled against hiH in August 2007. The trouble he suffered motivated him to record tfl <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>lease agreement in July 2004, in an effort to bolster his claim to the dock. From 2004 to 2007 he did not enjoy peaceable use of the dock. The rights he thought he had obtained under the lease were clearly threatened, and he was damaged at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-3\">\u00b636 The Court has failed to honor our precedent by issuing a decision which is inconsistent with cases such as <em>Peschel, Guest, Leaphart, </em>and <em>Burgett. </em>I believe this decision will cloud this area of the law. I would affirm.</p>\n<judges id=\"b553-4\">JUSTICE COTTER joins the dissenting Opinion of JUSTICE RICE.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b551-4\"><em> Estate of Watkins </em>and <em>Watkins Trust </em>arose from the same factual scenario, both lleging legal malpractice, but were brought separately due to conflicting expectations leated by the alleged malpractice. <em>Watkins Trust, </em>\u00b6 14.
