We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-8\">\u00b62 We review the following issue on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b492-9\">\u00b63 <em>Whether Foston\u2019s trial counsel\u2019s failure to object to the State\u2019s introduction of warrantless electronic surveillance of Foston constituted ineffective assistance of counsel that entitles Foston to postconviction relief.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b492-10\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b492-11\">\u00b64 The State of Montana (State) charged Foston with three counts of felony distribution of dangerous drugs. The State\u2019s case relied on information gathered by law enforcement officers who had monitored extensively Foston\u2019s activities. Detective Scott Newell of the Missoula County Sheriffs Department (Detective Newell) arranged a confidential informant (Cl) to make controlled drug purchases from Foston. Law enforcement officers observed interactions between Foston and the Cl on multiple occasions. Some of the interactions between Foston and the Cl took place in motel rooms in which the officers had installed video and audio monitoring devices that allowec them to hear and to see what occurred in the motel room. The officers also had observed drug trafficking activity without any video or audic surveillance.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-12\">\u00b65 The State did not present the Cl\u2019s testimony or any recordecH surveillance at trial. Detective Newell did testify, however, that th&lt;H activity that he had observed through the video and audio monitorinfl was consistent with \u2018his understanding of a drug deal.\u201dFoston objectecB to that statement. The court allowed the testimony as Detectivfl Newell\u2019s present sense impression under M. R. Evid. 803(1). The Statfl never attempted to introduce the audio and video recordings at trial*</p>\n<p id=\"AXj\">\u00b66 The State presented evidence beyond the electronic to make its case against Foston. Officers observed Foston entering anH leaving a motel room where the Cl had been waiting to purchase druaH <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>from Foston. Officers gave the Cl marked bills to purchase the drugs. The Cl gave the officers drugs that she had purchased from Foston with the marked bills. Officers followed Foston\u2019s car after one arranged buy and searched a residence where Foston had travelled. The search revealed drugs, excessive amounts of cash, and a semiautomatic handgun. Serial numbers on the cash found at the residence matched serial numbers on the cash that officers had given to the Cl to purchase drugs from Foston. The owner of the residence testified that drugs and the majority of the $8,900 in cash found at the residence belonged to Foston. The owner of the residence also testified that he knew that some of the cash was likely drug money.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-4\">\u00b67 A jury convicted Foston of two counts of felony distribution of dangerous drugs in violation of \u00a745-9-101, MCA. Foston appealed. <em>See State v. Foston, </em>2009 MT 191, 351 Mont. 85, 209 P.3d 262. Foston asked the Court to reverse his conviction based on our subsequent decision in <em>State v. Goetz, </em>2008 MT 296, 345 Mont. 421, 191 P.3d 489. We held in <em>Goetz </em>that warrantless electronic monitoring and recording of face to face conversations between informants and defendants in the defendants\u2019 home, in the absence of an exception to the warrant requirement, violated Montana Constitution Article II, Sections 10 and 11. <em>Foston, </em>\u00b6 11; <em>Goetz, </em>\u00b6 54.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">\u00b68 We did not decide <em>Goetz </em>until after Foston\u2019s trial had finished. The Court refused to apply <em>Goetz </em>retroactively to Foston\u2019s case, in part, because Foston\u2019s counsel had not objected at trial to the electronic surveillance on warrant grounds. <em>Foston, </em>\u00b6 12. The Court also concluded that the District Court should not have relied on M. R. Evid. 803(1) to allow Detective Newell\u2019s testimony regarding the electronic surveillance. <em>Foston, </em>\u00b6 17. The Court deemed Detective Newell\u2019s statement harmless, however, in light of other independent evidence presented at trial. <em>Foston, </em>\u00b6 19.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">1\u00b69 Foston filed a <em>pro se </em>petition for postconviction relief on the [grounds that his trial counsel\u2019s failure to object to the warrantless [electronic surveillance denied him effective assistance of counsel. The [District Court concluded that Foston\u2019s counsel had not provided Ineffective assistance when counsel failed to object to lawful evidence based on settled state and federal law. The court denied Foston\u2019s petition. Foston appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-7\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b493-8\">[10 We review a district court\u2019s findings of fact for clear error in nstconviction relief proceedings and its conclusions of law for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>correctness. <em>Whitlow v. State, </em>2008 MT 140, \u00b6 9, 343 Mont. 90, 183 P.3d 361. Ineffective assistance of counsel claims present mixed questions of law and fact that this Court reviews de novo. <em>Worthan v. State, </em>2010 MT 98, \u00b6 8, 356 Mont. 206, 232 P.3d 380. We will not review arguments that a petitioner presents for the first time on appeal. <em>Ford v. State, </em>2005 MT 151, \u00b6 12, 327 Mont. 378, 114 P.3d 244; <em>State v. Belanus, </em>2010 MT 204, \u00b6 17, 357 Mont. 463, 240 P.3d 1021.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">\u00b611 Foston raises several new issues on appeal that we decline to address. <em>Ford, </em>\u00b6 12, <em>Belanus, </em>\u00b6 17. We focus solely on whether Foston\u2019s counsel rendered ineffective assistance of counsel in failing to object at trial to the introduction of warrantless electronic surveillance. We apply the two-part test established in <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 104 S. Ct. 2052 (1984), to determine whether counsel rendered ineffective assistance. <em>Worthan, </em>\u00b6 10. The defendant must demonstrate that counsel\u2019s representation was deficient, and that| counsel\u2019s deficiency prejudiced the defense.Id. A petitioner who argues that trial counsel\u2019s failure to object rendered counsel ineffective mus show that counsel\u2019s trial objection would have been proper and tha the court likely would have sustained the objection. <em>Ford, </em>\u00b6 7; <em>State v. Jenkins, </em>2001 MT 79, \u00b6 11, 305 Mont. 95, 23 P.3d 201; <em>Kills on Top </em>v. <em>State, </em>273 Mont. 32, 51, 901 P.2d 1368, 1380 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b494-6\">\u00b612  A petitioner for postconviction relief must prove by preponderance of evidence that he or she is entitled to relief. Herman <em>v. State, </em>2006 MT 7, \u00b6 44, 330 Mont. 267, 127 P.3d 422. The court mus determine whether, in light of all the circumstances, the identified act; or omissions fell outside the wide range of professionally competen assistance. <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 690, 104 S. Ct. at 2066. This Cour has recognized that every effort must be made \u2018to eliminate th distorting effects of hindsight, to reconstruct the circumstances o| counsel\u2019s challenged conduct, and to evaluate the conduct fron] counsel\u2019s perspective at the time.\u201d Whitlow, \u00b6 15 (citing <em>Strickland, </em>460 U.S. at 689, 104 S. Ct. at 2065). The petitioner cannot rely oi| subsequently decided case law to render an attorney\u2019s condu ineffective at the time of trial. <em>Hans v. State, </em>283 Mont. 379, 402, 942 P.2d 674, 688 (1997), <em>overruled in part on other grounds, Whitlow, </em>13. Courts do not require counsel to anticipate future decision; <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 690, 104 S. Ct. at 2066.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-7\">\u00b613 Foston must show that his counsel\u2019s objection at trial would ha-been proper and that the trial court likely would have sustained t] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>objection. <em>Ford, </em>\u00b6 7; <em>Jenkins, </em>\u00b6 11. Foston\u2019s counsel could not have made a <em>Goetz </em>objection to the admission or warrantless electronic surveillance because <em>Goetz </em>had not yet been decided. Counsel could have objected to the electronic surveillance on constitutional grounds. Foston has not established, however, that the trial court likely would have sustained the objection. We cannot rely upon future decisions to determine whether a trial court would have sustained an earlier objection. <em>Hans, </em>283 Mont. at 402, 942 P.2d at 688.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-4\">\u00b614  Foston\u2019s counsel\u2019s failure to object fell well within the wide range of professionally competent assistance when counsel relied on state and federal case law at the time of trial. We do not require counsel to convince the district court or this Court to overrule relevant precedent in order to avoid rendering ineffective assistance of counsel. Foston has not demonstrated that his counsel\u2019s representation was deficient, therefore, we do not need to address whether the alleged deficiency prejudiced Foston\u2019s defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">\u00b615 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b495-6\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES WHEAT, COTTER and NELSON concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
