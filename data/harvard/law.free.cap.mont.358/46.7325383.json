After her arrest, the Department of Health and Human Services (DPHHS) initiated a Youth in Need of Care action to protect Manywhitehorses\u2019s children C.M. and J.M.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-7\">\u00b65 On August 14,2008, C.M. and J.M. were adjudicated as youths in need of care and Manywhitehorses was ordered to advise DPHHS of J.M.\u2019s location. Initially, Manywhitehorses informed DPHHS that J.M. was with Gilbert Barrientos (Barrientos) in Portland, Oregon. After contacting Barrientos, however, DPHHS determined that J.M. was not in Portland, Oregon and requested that J.M. be listed as a missing child.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-8\">\u00b66 On September 5, 2008, Detective McDermott of the Great Falls Police Department interviewed Manywhitehorses concerning J.M.\u2019s whereabouts. After persisting in her story that J.M. was with Barrientos, Manywhitehorses finally conceded that J.M.\u2019s body was in the car which the police had impounded after her DUI arrest on July 21, 2008. After obtaining a search warrant, police found J.M.\u2019s I decomposed body in the trunk of Manywhitehorses\u2019s car. Manywhitehorses then informed Detective McDermott that on May 28, 2008, J.M. had fallen from his high chair and hit his head. Manywhitehorses explained that despite the fact that J.M.\u2019s eyes had rolled back in his head, she determined that he would be \u201call right\u201d and, out of fear that \u201cthey\u2019re going to think it was me,\u201d did not call an ambulance. Manywhitehorses further informed Detective McDermott that the next morning she discovered J.M. was not breathing and had in fact died during the night. Law enforcement subsequently determined that Manywhitehorses had placed J.M.\u2019s body in her car on June 11, 2008, where the body remained until September 5, 2008. On September 22, 2008, the State charged Manywhitehorses with deliberate homicide along with negligent homicide and tampering with physical evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-9\">\u00b67 On June 12, 2009, a change of plea hearing was held and, pursuant to the plea agreement, Manywhitehorses entered guilty pleas to negligent homicide and tampering with physical evidence. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>exchange, the prosecutor dismissed the deliberate homicide charge and agreed to recommend a sentence of 20 years for the tampering with physical evidence charge. The prosecutor did not agree to recommend any particular sentence for the negligent homicide charge. During the change of plea hearing, Manywhitehorses also acknowledged that she understood the persistent felony offender statute allowed the State to recommend up to 100 years for the negligent homicide conviction. When asked by the District Court about her understanding of what the State intended to recommend at sentencing, she responded, \u2018tflor tampering and negligence to run concurrent and that there\u2019 s-it\u2019s all up to the judge, my sentence, pretty much.\u201d Pursuant to the plea agreement, Manywhitehorses admitted that on May 28 or 29, 2008, when her son Vent into distress\u201d she should have called for an ambulance and that had she done so J.M. may not have died. She also conceded that she concealed J.M.\u2019s body in the trunk of her car until September 2008, even though she knew that law enforcement and DPHHS were looking for him.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-4\">\u00b68 On August 12,2009, a sentencing hearing was held and the State called two witnesses to testify-Detective McDermott and Dr. Wells. When the State questioned Detective McDermott about statements he took from witnesses indicating that Manywhitehorses had abused J.M. in the past, the District Court explained that such testimony was not relevant to the negligent homicide conviction. The District Court again expressed concern when Dr. Wells indicated that she did not believe Manywhitehorses\u2019s claim that J.M. had fallen from his high chair testifying that, \u2018It\u2019s exceedingly rare that that kind of short fall [from a highchair]... would be enough to cause the death of a child.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b70-5\">\u00b69 Pursuant to the plea agreement, the State recommended 20 years for the tampering with physical evidence charge. Pursuant to the persistent felony offender statute, the State recommended 100 years for the negligent homicide charge. The District Court refused to adopt the State\u2019s recommendation on the negligent homicide charge and instead sentenced Manywhitehorses to concurrent terms of 40 years for negligent homicide and 15 years for tampering with physical evidence. Manywhitehorses appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b70-7\">\u00b610 When a defendant alleges that a district court has erred in failing to require the state to abide by the plea agreement, the correct standard of review is abuse of discretion. <em>State v. Rardon, </em>1999 MT 220, \u00b6 11, 296 Mont. 19, 986 P.3d 424 <em>(Rardon I). </em>When, as here, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>defendant does not point to any alleged error by the court, but rather claims that the prosecutor has breached the plea agreement, we employ a de novo standard of review. <em>State v. Rardon, </em>2002 MT 345, \u00b6 15, 314 Mont. 321, 61 P.3d 132 <em>(Rardon II). </em>A plea agreement is a contract and is thus subject to contract law standards. <em>State v. Hill, </em>2009 MT 134, \u00b6 49, 350 Mont. 296, 207 P.3d 307. It is well established that the question of whether a contract has been breached is a question of law which this Court reviews de novo. <em>State v. Shepard, </em>2010 MT 20, \u00b6 8, 355 Mont. 114, 225 P.3d 1217. Thus, the appropriate standard of review for addressing a claim of breach of the plea agreement is de novo.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b71-5\">\u00b611 <em>Whether the prosecutor\u2019s conduct at sentencing breached the State\u2019s contractual obligations under the plea agreement.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b71-6\">\u00b612 On appeal, Manywhitehorses argues that the State breached its obligations under the plea agreement. Specifically, Manywhitehorses asserts that during the sentencing hearing the prosecutor improperly offered evidence that J.M.\u2019s death resulted from deliberate homicide, rather than the negligent homicide charge to which she had plead guilty. She also maintains that the prosecutor attacked the factual basis of her negligent homicide conviction and circumvented the plea agreement to \u2018backdoor evidence of deliberate homicide through [her] tampering with physical evidence conviction.\u201d As a result of what she argues is a violation of the plea agreement, Manywhitehorses asserts that this Court should remand the case to the District Court with instructions to allow Manywhitehorses the opportunity to choose between the equitable remedies of rescission and specific performance. \u00b613 The State counters that it did not breach the plea agreement and that the sentencing court was free to \u201cconsider any matter relevant to the disposition of an offender.\u201d The State points out that pursuant to the verbal plea agreement, it was free to make any sentence recommendation for the negligent homicide conviction within the statutory parameters of the persistent felony offender statute. Accordingly, the State maintains that the District Court properly considered Detective McDermott\u2019s testimony regarding Manywhitehorses\u2019s treatment of J.M. as well as Dr. Wells\u2019s testimony indicating that J.M. did not die from falling out of his high chair. The State argues that \u2018[t]he sum total of [its] promises to Manywhitehorses [was] that if she pled guilty to negligent homicide and tampering with evidence, [the State] would recommend a 20-year sentence on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>tampering with evidence conviction.\u201d Therefore, the State concludes that the plea agreement was not breached and the District Court did not err.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-4\">\u00b614 It is well established that a sentencing court \u201cmay consider any relevant evidence relating to the character of the defendant, his [or her] history, his [or her] mental and physical condition, and the broad spectrum of incidents making up his [or her] background... including] other acts, even those which are dismissed pursuant to a plea bargain agreement.\u201d <em>Hill, </em>\u00b6 31. While prosecutors who engage in plea bargaining must meet strict and meticulous standards of both promise and performance, \u201cthere are no hard and fast criteria defining a when a prosecutor has merely paid lip service to a plea <em>agreement...\u201d Id. </em>at \u00b6 29. Rather, \u2018[e]ach case stands or falls on the facts unique to it.\u201d <em>Rardon II, </em>\u00b6 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-5\">\u00b615 Here, the plea agreement at issue provided that Manywhitehorses would plead guilty to negligent homicide and tampering with physical evidence in exchange for the prosecutor dismissing the deliberate homicide charge and agreeing to recommend a 20-year sentence on the tampering with physical evidence charge. The plea agreement contained no sentencing recommendation promises with respect to Manywhitehorses\u2019s conviction for negligent homicide. In other words, the plea agreement did not prohibit the State from recommending, and arguing in support of, up to a 100-year sentence as permitted by the persistent felony offender statute. This is exactly what the State did.</p>\n<p id=\"A-\">\u00b616  As we explained in <em>Hill, </em>evidence of a defendant\u2019s history, incidents making up a defendant\u2019s background, and even acts that have been dismissed pursuant to a plea agreement may be considered if they are relevant. <em>Hill, </em>\u00b6 31. In Manywhitehorses\u2019s case, the evidence offered at sentencing, including photographs of J.M.\u2019s body and testimony by Detective McDermott and Dr. Wells, was directly relevant to Manywhitehorses\u2019s history and the incidents leading up to J.M.\u2019s death. Here, as in <em>Hill, </em>we cannot conclude that the State violated the plea agreement. The State offered evidence and testimony that, while perhaps indicative of a deliberate homicide charge, was also relevant to the charges to which Manywhitehorses pled guilty. \u00b617 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b72-6\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES NELSON, MORRIS and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
