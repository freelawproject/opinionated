L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 58A, \u00a7 13, as most recently amended by St. 1939, c. 366, \u00a7 1, from a decision of the Appellate Tax Board holding that in the distribution of the corporate franchise tax assessed upon Malden Electric Company for the year 1948 the city was entitled to receive the sum of $29,485.45 in addition to the sum previously determined by the commissioner to be due to the city. See G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 63, \u00a7 58; c. 58, \u00a7 24, as amended by St. 1933, c. 254, \u00a7 23; and c. 58,. \u00a7 25, as appearing in St. 1945, c. 687.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-15\">1. The commissioner filed before the board a motion to dismiss, which was denied, and now contends that the cause <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>should be dismissed by this court for want of jurisdiction for the reason that the petition to the board was signed in the name of the city of Malden \u201cBy Fred Lamson.Mayor\u201d instead of by the city treasurer to whom under G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 58, \u00a7 25, as amended, the commissioner is required to give notice of the amount distributable. There is, however, nothing in the pertinent statutes which requires that the petition be signed by the treasurer. The language of c. 58, \u00a7 25, as appearing in St. 1945, c. 687, is simply that the decision of the commissioner \u201cshall be subject to appeal to the appellate tax board.\u201d The charter, of Malden, St. 1881, c. 169, \u00a7 10, provides in part, \u201cThe mayor shall be the chief executive officer of the city. It shall be his duty to be active and vigilant in causing the laws and regulations of the city to be enforced, and to keep a general supervision over the conduct of all subordinate officers.\u201d The extensive powers of mayors under this and similar charter provisions are shown by such cases as <em>Pedrick </em>v. <em>Bailey, </em>12 Gray, 161, 163, <em>Nichols </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>98 Mass. 39, 44, <em>Rollins </em>v. <em>Salem, </em>251 Mass. 468, and <em>Commissioner of Corporations &amp; Taxation </em>v. <em>Malden, </em>321 Mass. 46, 49. The officer to whom such powers are entrusted would seem to be the natural officer to sign the city\u2019s name to a petition of this kind. It would seem that the \u201cerror of law\u201d set out by the commissioner in his claim of appeal as required by G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 58A, \u00a7 13, as amended, is not that the petition was brought without authority from the city, but is rather that the mayor was not \u201cthe proper party to sign\u201d it. But even if this is not so, and even if we . assume, without deciding, that the mayor needed some authority beyond his own (see <em>Walpole </em>v. <em>Gray, </em>11 Allen, 149; <em>Great Barrington </em>v. <em>Gibbons, </em>199 Mass. 527, 529), we think that there is a presumption in the absence of evidence to the contrary that this petition which he signed for the city\u2019s benefit was regularly authorized by the city. <em>Commercial Wharf Corp. </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>194 Mass. 460, 467. <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>United States, </em>324 Mass. 639, 646-647. In <em>Taunton </em>v. <em>Taylor, </em>116 Mass. 254, where suit was brought at the instance of the board of health, it. was said on page <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>262, \u201cIn such a suit, as in any other lawfully brought in the name of the city, the bill may properly be signed by the mayor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b315-4\">2. We now come to the merits. Under G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 58, \u00a7 24, as amended, the corporate franchise taxes paid by gas, electric light, gas and electric light, and water companies are retained by the Commonwealth in proportion to the amount of stock owned by \u201cnon-residents,\u201d and the remainder is distributed to the municipalities where the businesses are carried on. A very large majority of the stock of Malden Electric Company was held by The First National Bank of Boston \u201cas trustee of the New England Electric System.\u201d For the purposes of the statute the trustee was the owner of this stock. <em>Commissioner of Corporations &amp; Taxation </em>v. <em>Springfield, </em>321 Mass. 31, 40-43. The real issue is whether under \u00a7 24, as amended, a national bank established within this Commonwealth is a nonresident. If it is not, the city is entitled to the further distribution which it claims. There is no controversy over the amount.</p>\n<p id=\"AeR\">It is to be observed that there is here no question of imposing a tax or any kind of burden whatever upon a national bank. The question is simply one of the distribution under the law of this Commonwealth between the Commonwealth itself and its municipalities of a tax collected by the Commonwealth from Malden Electric Company. In <em>First National Bank </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Corporations &amp; Taxation, </em>279 Mass. 168, an income tax had been assessed upon the bank as trustee with respect to income received by it for the benefit of a Massachusetts resident, and at least some slight burden was imposed upon the bank. The assessment was held valid, the court saying, at page 172, \u201cThe appellant as a national banking association was subject to the laws of this Commonwealth, where it was located, except as they may conflict with the paramount law of the United States <em>and is to be deemed an inhabitant of this Common</em>wealth.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Continental National Bank of Memphis </em>v. <em>Buford, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>191 U. S. 119, 123, 124. <em>First National Bank in St. Louis </em>v. <em>Missouri, </em>263 U, S. 640, 656. <em>Missouri </em>v. <em>Duncan, </em>265 U. S. 17.\u201d See also 279 Mass, at page 174. It is settled that national banks are subject, in general, to the laws of the States in which they do business, unless those laws interfere with the purposes of their creation, tend to destroy their efficiency as Federal agencies, or conflict with the paramount \u2022law of the United States. <em>Lewis </em>v. <em>Fidelity &amp; Deposit Co. </em>292 U. S. 559, 566. For Federal jurisdictional purposes national banks have for many years been treated as citizens of the States in which they are located. Judicial Code of 1948, U. S. C. (1946 ed.) Sup. II, Title 28, \u00a7 1348, as appearing in act of June 25, 1948, 62 U. S. Sts. at Large, 933-934. <em>Leather Manufacturers\u2019 Bank </em>v. <em>Cooper, </em>120 U. S. 778. <em>Ex parte Jones, </em>164 U. S. 691. <em>Fulton National Bank </em>v. <em>Hozier, </em>267 U. S. 276, 281. In <em>Cope </em>v. <em>Anderson, </em>331 U. S. 461, at page 467, the court said, \u201cMany provisions of federal law make national banks, in important aspects, peculiarly local institutions,\u201d citing statutes. On the same page the court refers to the place where a national bank does business as its \u201chome\u201d and as its \u201clocal habitat.\u201d In <em>Collector of Taxes of Boston </em>v. <em>Proprietors of the Cemetery of Mount Auburn, </em>217 Mass. 286, at page 288, this court said, \u201cA business corporation commonly is said to have its residence where its chief corporate activities are conducted.\u201d And see pages 290-291 and citations. If national banks set up in this Commonwealth are not residents here it is difficult to discover any other place of which they are residents.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">In order to apply the distribution provisions of G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 58, \u00a7 24, as amended, in an instance like the present, it has become necessary to classify national banks established here either as residents or as \u201cnon-residents\u201d within the meaning of that section. For the reasons outlined above it seems to us more reasonable and more consonant with the purposes of the section to classify them as \u25a0residents.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-6\">We have carefully considered the argument in the brief of the Attorney General for the commissioner based on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>statutory history, but we are of opinion that the whole basis of distribution has been so radically altered by the later statutory changes that the argument now has little persuasive force.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">The decision of the board was right.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">The commissioner shall notify the treasurer of Malden that there is due to that city the further sum of $29,485.45, and shall certify that amount to the State Treasurer for payment. G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 58A, \u00a7 13, as amended; c. 58, \u00a7 25, as appearing in St. 1945, c. 687.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b315-6\"> Emphasis supplied.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
