L. [Ter. Ed.] c. 92, \u00a7 37) by displaying certain signs and other advertising. The material portion of Rule 3 reads, \u201cNo <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>person shall . . . post, paint, affix, distribute or display any sign,' notice, circular, program, placard or any other advertising device . . ..\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b724-5\">There was evidence that on the afternoon of July 23,1950, the three defendants, with from fifteen to seventeen other persons, assembled on Revere Beach Reservation within the metropolitan park district and occupied an area of about fifty square feet,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> within which area the group had posted signs attached to sticks embedded in the sand. Four of the signs were on cloth eight feet by fourteen inches and were about five feet above the ground. Six of the signs were on cardboard twenty-four inches by thirty inches. On the signs were printed these words, \u201cWe Want Peace\u201d; \u201cHomes and Schools not Atomic Bombs\u201d; \u201cSupport the International Red Cross Peace Proposal\u201d; \u201cOutlaw the Atom Bomb\u201d; \u201cWe Want to Grow up in a World at Peace\u201d; \u201cYoung Progressives \u25a0 of America.\u201d There was evidence that there was some inconvenience to the public in moving across the area, but that there was \u201cno unrest or commotion at the scene,\u201d although the beach was crowded. There was also evidence of admissions by the defendants that they posted or assisted in posting some of the signs.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-6\">The fundamental question in the case is whether so much of Rule 3 as prohibits the display of any sign is unconstitutional on its face as an infringement upon the right of free speech as guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment under the rule established by recent decisions of the Supreme Court of the United States and followed in our own decisions. We are of opinion that it is.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-7\">The part of Rule 3 here involved attempts a complete and sweeping prohibition of the display of any sign or other advertising device in what is substantially a public park where all persons have a right to go. The rule cannot fairly be construed as limited to commercial advertising. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kimball, </em>299 Mass. 353, 356. It is not aptly and narrowly phrased to protect the public from annoyance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>or danger or to protect public property. It does not merely regulate the size or position of signs. It seeks to prohibit altogether in a public place one of the common and normally harmless means of communicating ideas. It therefore falls within the scope of the decisions in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pascone, </em>308 Mass. 591, and <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gilfedder, </em>321 Mass. 335. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Akmakjian, </em>316 Mass. 97, 101-102; <em>Kenyon </em>v. <em>Chicopee, </em>320 Mass. 528, 531; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Carpenter, </em>325 Mass. 519. These cases contain adequate citations of the decisions of the Supreme Court of the United States upon which they rest. A few of the more recent cases in that court, by which also we are bound, are <em>Saia </em>v. <em>New York, </em>334 U. S. 558, <em>Niemotko </em>v. <em>Maryland, </em>340 U. S. 268, and <em>Kunz </em>v. <em>New York, </em>340 U. S. 290. Compare <em>Kovacs </em>v. <em>Cooper, </em>336 U. S. 77. See <em>Dennis </em>v. <em>United States, </em>341 U. S. 494.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-5\">This decision is confined to the precise issue here discussed. It is not necessary to consider what position we should take if, for example, instead of simply displaying signs, the defendants had painted a sign upon some permanent structure or had violated any other of the several prohibitions which are joined in Rule 3. The distinction between an unconstitutional prohibition of free speech and a reasonable regulation of the exercise of that right may at times be difficult to draw, but the distinction must be scrupulously maintained.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-6\">In each case the entry will be</p>\n<p id=\"b725-7\">\n<em>Exceptions sustained.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b725-8\">\n<em>Judgment for the defendant.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b724-8\"> The area seems small for so many signs of the sizes stated, but we are following the record.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
