Godfrey, late of Swampscott, raises the question whether a devise or legacy given by the testatrix in her will to her nephew Frank H. Helmer, of Merced, California, wholly lapsed when the nephew died before the testatrix, or whether it became payable to the respondents Raymond Ronald Helmer and Frank H. Helmer, Junior, as surviving issue of the deceased devisee or- legatee in accordance with G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 191, \u00a7 22. These respondents were adopted by the nephew many years ago in California and still reside there. It is their contention that by reason of this adoption <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>they became under California law \u201cissue\u201d of the deceased nephew for all purposes, including that of taking under our statute devises or legacies which otherwise would lapse. The decedent was a resident of this Commonwealth and her entire estate was physically within the Commonwealth. These respondents appeal from a decision adverse to them.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-5\">The general proposition is unquestioned that the estate located here of a Massachusetts decedent must descend or be distributed in accordance with Massachusetts law. The chapter of our General Laws (Ter. Ed.) relating to adoption, c. 210, contains certain provisions affecting descent and distribution. One of these (G. L. \u00a3Ter. Ed.J c. 210, \u00a7 9) reads, \u201cAn inhabitant of another state, adopted as a child in accordance with the laws thereof, shall upon proof of such fact be entitled in this commonwealth to the same rights of succession to property as he would have had in the state where he was adopted, except so far as such rights are in conflict with this chapter.\u201d In <em>Cobb </em>v. <em>Old Colony Trust Co. </em>295 Mass. 338, careful consideration was given to the construction of this section. In that case at pages 342-343 this court said, \u201cThe correct construction of said \u00a7 9 is that the inhabitant of another State adopted in accordance with its laws is not entitled to greater rights of succession than are given by its laws, and is not entitled to greater rights of succession than are given by the laws of this Commonwealth. See <em>Ross </em>v. <em>Ross, </em>129 Mass. 243, 268; <em>Nickerson </em>v. <em>Allen, </em>293 Mass. 136, 137.\u201d This is in conformity with the general rule laid down in the absence of statute by Restatement: Conflict of Laws, \u00a7 143, \u201cThe status of adoption, created by the law of a state having jurisdiction to create it, will be given the same effect in another state as is given by the latter state to the status of adoption when created by its own law.\u201d See further \u00a7 305 and comments.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-6\">The question then arises whether if the adoption had been in this Commonwealth these respondents, who had been adopted, not by the decedent, but by her nephew, would thereby have been brought into such a relation to the decedent that they would have taken under her will as \u201cissue\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>of the nephew when he died before the testatrix. The answer must be in the negative. It is plain from other sections of c. 210 that under our law an adopted child does not become for all purposes the child or \u201cissue\u201d of the adopting parent. In our statute the intent is manifest to create a relationship or status between the adopting parent and his descendants on the one hand and the adopted child on the other hand, but in general not to force that relationship or its consequences upon other kindred. This appears from \u00a7\u00a7 7 and 8. It was held in <em>Gammons </em>v. <em>Gammons, </em>212 Mass. 454, that under the predecessor of \u00a7 8 a person in the position of these respondents whose adoption had taken place in this Commonwealth could not take under what is now G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 191, \u00a7 22, as \u201cissue\u201d of a legatee who had adopted her and who died before the testator. See also <em>Wyeth </em>v. <em>Stone, </em>144 Mass. 441; <em>Young </em>v. <em>Stearns, </em>234 Mass. 540. We do not read what was said in <em>Boutlier </em>v. <em>Malden, </em>226 Mass. 479, at pages 484-485, as impairing the authority of <em>Gammons </em>v. <em>Gammons.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b766-5\">It follows that the decree was .right.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-6\">\n<em>Decree affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
