The defendant excepts to the refusal of a directed verdict in his favor and to the admission in evidence of two letters and a telegram which the plaintiff contended had been sent by the defendant to the plaintiff\u2019s wife.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-10\">If the disputed letters were part of the evidence, there was no error in the refusal to direct a verdict for the defendant. There was evidence that, until \u201cthe defendant appeared,\u201d the plaintiff and his wife lived happily with their two children in a house which was bought in the names of both; that after she met the defendant she ceased to care for the plaintiff or the children; that the defendant and the plaintiff\u2019s wife wrote each other and saw each other from time to time; that the defendant\u2019s two letters introduced in evidence were full of expressions of affection; that the defendant wrote the plaintiff\u2019s wife about the annulment of her marriage to the plaintiff or her obtaining a divorce from him and marrying the defendant; that he wrote of their promises to marry each other; that in the letter dated October 23, 1945, he advised her to separate from the plaintiff, so that when the defendant came home he could see the plaintiff\u2019s wife more often and with less difficulty and embarrassment; that in 1947 the plaintiff\u2019s wife did leave the plaintiff; and that the defendant is now her landlord. The defendant did not testify. This evidence, with the reasonable inferences to be drawn from it, satisfies all the requirements for a cause of action. <em>Gahagan </em>v. <em>Church, </em>239 Mass. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>558. <em>Bradstreet </em>v. <em>Wallace, </em>254 Mass. 509. <em>Sherry </em>v. <em>Moore, </em>258 Mass. 420. <em>Georgacopoulos </em>v. <em>Katralis, </em>318 Mass. 34. <em>White </em>v. <em>Thomson, </em>324 Mass. 140, 142.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-4\">There was no error in the matter of the two letters. A witness called by the plaintiff testified, apparently without objection, that these letters were left in the witness\u2019s mail box; that she gave them to the plaintiff\u2019s wife and read them to her;<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> that they were in the handwriting of the defendant; and that she \u201crecognized his letter.\u201d' Upon this, the judge admitted them over the defendant\u2019s objections and exceptions. Doubtless the defendant could have objected to the testimony of the witness that the letters were in the handwriting of the defendant and could have required preliminary proof that the witness had seen the defendant write or was \u201cconversant with his acknowledged signature\u201d to the extent required by the rules of evidence. <em>Brigham </em>v. <em>Peters, </em>1 Gray, 139, 145. <em>Nunes </em>v. <em>Perry, </em>113 Mass. 274. <em>Noyes </em>v. <em>Noyes, </em>224 Mass. 125, 129-131. But the statement of the witness that the letters were in the handwriting of the defendant was evidence in the case received without objection and had probative force. <em>DuBois </em>v. <em>Powdrell, </em>271 Mass. 394, 397-398. <em>Ventromile </em>v. <em>Malden Electric Co. </em>317 Mass. 132, 135. <em>Comeau </em>v. <em>Beck, </em>319 Mass. 17, 19. It warranted the admission of the letters, which, once admitted, would remain in the case until struck out. If the witness, later on in cross-examination, gave other evidence tending to show that she was not familiar with the handwriting of the defendant and throwing doubt upon the admissibility of the letters, the defendant\u2019s remedy was to ask the judge to reconsider the matter by a motion to strike them out. <em>Brady </em>v. <em>Finn, </em>162 Mass. 260. <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Clarke, </em>182 Mass. 316, 317. <em>Putnam </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>193 Mass. 58, 62. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Patalano, </em>254 Mass. 69, 74-75. <em>Alden Bros.

Love Francis C. Judeikis.\u201d After the letters were in evidence this telegram added nothing of consequence to what was contained in them. In view of all the other evidence, if there was error in admitting the telegram, which we need not decide, it was harmless error. G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 231, \u00a7 132. <em>Exceptions overruled.</em></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b302-5\"> There was evidence that the plaintiff's wife \u201ccould not read much English.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
