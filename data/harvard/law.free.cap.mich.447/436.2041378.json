These cases raise three issues with regard to the state\u2019s imposition of criminal responsibility on persons who assist others in committing suicide. Two questions are presented by the appeals in Docket Nos. 99591, 99752, 99758, and 99759: (1) whether the Michigan assisted suicide statute, MCL 752.1027; MSA 28.547(127), was enacted in violation of Const 1963, art 4, \u00a7 24; (2) whether the criminal provisions of MCL 752.1027; MSA 28.547(127) violate the United States Constitution. In Docket No. 99674, a case predating the assisted suicide statute, the question presented is: (3) whether the circuit court erred in quashing the information charging the defendant with murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-9\">A majority of the justices is of the opinion that:</p>\n<p id=\"b670-10\">1) The assisted suicide provisions of the statute were validly enacted and do not violate the Title-Object Clause of the Michigan Constitution. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>(Cavanagh, C.J., and Levin, Brickley, Boyle, Riley, Griffin, and Mallett, JJ.)</p>\n<p id=\"b671-6\">2) The United States Constitution does not prohibit a state from imposing criminal penalties on one who assists another in committing suicide. (Cavanagh, C.J., and Brickley, Boyle, Riley, and Griffin, JJ.)</p>\n<p id=\"b671-7\">3) In the murder case, <em>People v Roberts, </em>211 Mich 187; 178 NW 690 (1920), is overruled to the extent that it can be read to support the view that the common-law definition of murder encompasses the act of intentionally providing the means by which a person commits suicide. Only where there is probable cause to believe that death was the direct and natural result of a defendant\u2019s act can the defendant be properly bound over on a charge of murder. Where a defendant merely is involved in the events leading up to the death, such as providing the means, the proper charge is assisting in a suicide, which may be prosecuted as a common-law felony under the saving clause, MCL 750.505; MSA 28.773, in the absence of a statute that specifically prohibits assisting in a suicide. (Cavanagh, C.J., and Levin, Brickley, Griffin, and Mallett, JJ.)</p>\n<p id=\"b671-8\">4) The motion to quash must be reconsidered by the circuit court to determine whether the evidence produced at the preliminary examination was sufficient to. bind the defendant over for trial. (Cavanagh, C.J., and Brickley, Griffin, and Mallett, JJ.)</p>\n<p id=\"b671-9\">We reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals in <em>People v Kevorkian, </em>Docket No. 99591, and <em>People v Kevorkian, </em>Docket No. 99759, and remand the cases to the respective circuit courts for further proceedings. In <em>Hobbins v Attorney General, </em>Docket Nos. 99752 and 99758, we reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals with regard <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>to the claimed violation of Const 1963, art 4, \u00a7 24, and affirm in all other respects. Finally, in <em>People v Kevorkian, </em>Docket No. 99674, we vacate the judgment of the Court of Appeals, and remand the case to the circuit court for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-4\">This memorandum opinion is signed by the seven justices. There are separate concurring and dissenting opinions. However, at least four justices concur in every holding, statement, and disposition of this memorandum opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-5\">Cavanagh, C.J., and Brickley and Griffin, JJ. These cases raise three issues with regard to the state\u2019s imposition of criminal responsibility on persons who assist others in committing suicide. Two questions are presented by the appeals in Docket Nos. 99591, 99752, 99758, and 99759: (1) Whether the Michigan assisted suicide statute, MCL 752.1027; MSA 28.547(127), was enacted in violation of Const 1963, art 4, \u00a7 24. (2) Whether the criminal provisions of MCL 752.1027; MSA 28.547(127) violate the United States Constitution. In Docket No. 99674, a case predating the assisted suicide statute, the question presented is: (3) Whether the circuit court erred in quashing the information charging the defendant with murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-6\">We conclude: (1) the assisted suicide provisions of the statute were validly enacted and do not violate the Title-Object Clause of the Michigan Constitution; (2) the United States Constitution does not prohibit a state from imposing criminal penalties on one who assists another in committing suicide; (3) in the murder case, the motion to quash must be reconsidered by the circuit court to determine if the evidence produced at the preliminary examination was sufficient to bind the defendant over for trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b673-4\">\n<em>HOBBINS v ATTORNEY GENERAL</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AAG\">(DOCKET NOS. 99752, 99758)</p>\n<p id=\"b673-5\">THE \"DECLARATORY JUDGMENT ACTION\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b673-6\">Shortly after the Legislature enacted the assisted suicide statute, a group of plaintiffs, two of whom are alleged to be suffering from terminal cancer, a friend of one of them, and seven medical care professionals, brought an action in Wayne Circuit Court, seeking a declaration that the statute was unconstitutional. The parties moved for summary judgment and the plaintiffs sought a preliminary injunction against enforcement of the statute. The circuit court found the statute to be unconstitutional.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> First, it concluded that there were two violations of Const 1963, art 4, \u00a7 24: the statute did not have a single object, and there was a change in the purpose of the bill during its passage through the Legislature. Second, the court found a due process right to commit suicide. However, it declined to issue a preliminary injunction, concluding that hearings would be needed to determine whether the statute placed an undue burden on that right. The Attorney General filed a claim of appeal in the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-7\">\n<em>PEOPLE v KEVORKIAN</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"Anh\">(DOCKET NO. 99591)</p>\n<p id=\"b673-8\">THE \"WAYNE COUNTY ASSISTED SUICIDE CASE\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b673-9\">Also after the enactment of the assisted suicide statute, defendant Kevorkian is alleged to have assisted in the death of Donald O\u2019Keefe. The de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>fendant was charged under the statute and bound over after preliminary examination. He moved to dismiss, and the circuit court granted the motion. The court rejected the art 4, \u00a7 24 challenges to the statute, but found a due process interest in the decision to end one\u2019s life, and that the law impermissibly burdened that interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-4\">The court held an evidentiary hearing to determine if the facts satisfied the four-part test that it had set forth in its opinion.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Following the hearing, the court issued an order concluding that the facts of the case met the standard and dismissed the charge. The prosecutor appealed to the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-5\">\n<em>PEOPLE v KEVORKIAN</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"Ahb\">(DOCKET NO. 99759)</p>\n<p id=\"b674-6\">THE \"OAKLAND COUNTY ASSISTED SUICIDE CASE\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b674-7\">Defendant Kevorkian was charged in two separate files with assisting in the suicides of Merion Frederick and Ali Khalili. The defendant was bound over after a preliminary examination in one case and waived examination in the other. The circuit court granted the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss. The court discussed the potential privacy and liberty interests in ending one\u2019s life, concluding that a person does have the right to commit suicide. However, it further concluded that defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>dant Kevorkian lacked standing to challenge the statute.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The court also found that the statute was unconstitutional because it had more than one object and because its purpose was changed during its passage through the Legislature. The prosecuting attorney appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-4\">\n<em>PEOPLE v KEVORKIAN</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AWK\">(DOCKET NO. 99674)</p>\n<p id=\"b675-5\">THE \"OAKLAND COUNTY MURDER CASE\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b675-6\">Before the statute was enacted, defendant Kevorkian allegedly assisted in the deaths of Sherry Miller and Marjorie Wantz on October 23, 1991. He was indicted by a citizens\u2019 grand jury on two counts of murder.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> After a preliminary examination, the defendant was bound over for trial.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In the circuit court, the defendant moved to dismiss, and the circuit judge granted the motion, concluding that assisting in suicide does not fall within the crime of murder. The prosecutor appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-7\">ii</p>\n<p id=\"b675-8\">The Court of Appeals issued its decisions in two sets of opinions on May 10, 1994. One decision dealt with the cases involving the assisted suicide statute.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The majority concluded that the assisted suicide statute was unconstitutional because the act had more than one object, in violation of art 4, \u00a7 24. Though recognizing that it arguably was not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>necessary to deal with the remaining issue, the majority went on to consider whether the statute violated the United States Constitution. The majority concluded that there was no violation, and that the state was free to make it a criminal offense to assist another in committing suicide.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b676-4\">The appeal regarding the murder case was decided separately.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The majority<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> concluded that the circuit court erred in quashing the information.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-5\">hi</p>\n<p id=\"b676-6\">The prosecuting authorities in each of the assisted suicide cases appealed the conclusion that the assisted suicide statute was enacted in violation of Const 1963, art 4, \u00a7 24. Defendant Kevorkian filed a cross appeal with regard to the United States constitutional issue in the Wayne County assisted suicide case, and the plaintiffs in the declaratory judgment action filed their own application for leave to appeal on that issue. In the murder case, defendant Kevorkian filed an application for leave to appeal. On June 6, 1994, we granted the applications, 445 Mich 920, and the cases were argued on October 4, 1994.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-7\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b676-8\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b676-9\">During 1991, several bills were introduced in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>Legislature regarding the subject of assisting in suicide. The bill that ultimately became 1992 PA 270 was introduced on March 7, 1991, as HB 4501. As originally introduced, it would have created the Michigan Commission on Death and Dying that was to study \"voluntary self-termination of life\u201d and related subjects and report its recommendations to the Legislature.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> It was referred to the Judiciary Committee, and there were public hearings in December 1991. The committee reported a substitute bill to the House on November 12, 1992.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-4\">On November 24, the House amended the substitute bill by adding a section that would make it a crime to assist another in committing suicide,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and the bill passed the House on that date.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The Senate passed the bill on December 3, 1992, and it was signed by the Governor on December 15. 1992 PA 270. It was to be effective March 31, 1993, ninety days after the legislative session, as provided by Const 1963, art 4, \u00a7 27._</p>\n<p id=\"b678-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>On January 26, 1993, SB 211 was introduced to amend \u00a7 7 of 1992 PA 270, which contained the criminal penalties.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> It passed the Senate on February 11. On February 25, the House approved a substitute, which, among other things, provided that the act, including both the commission and criminal provisions, would be effective on February 25, 1993. The Senate concurred in the substitute, and the Governor signed the bill that same day. 1993 PA 3.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b678-4\">Each house had voted to give the act immediate effect, and thus the act was effective on February 25, 1993. The enrolled bill<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> sets forth <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>the full text of each section of the act as required by Const 1963, art 4, \u00a7 25. Pursuant to the statute, the Commission on Death and Dying was constituted and prepared its final report to the Legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-4\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b679-5\">Const 1963, art 4, \u00a7 24 provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b679-6\">No law shall embrace more than one object, which shall be expressed in its title. No bill shall be altered or amended on its passage through either house so as to change its original purpose as determined by its total content and not alone by its title.[<footnotemark>16</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b679-7\">Three kinds of challenges may be brought against statutes on the basis of Const 1963, art 4, \u00a724: (1) a \"title-body\u201d challenge, (2) a multiple-object challenge, and (3) a change of purpose challenge. No \"title-body\u201d challenge, claiming that the title of the act does not adequately express the content of the law, is before us. However, the other two bases for contesting the statute are presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-8\">The circuit court in both the declaratory judgment action and the Oakland County assisted suicide case held that the statute had more than one object and that the purpose of HB 4501 was changed during its passage through the Legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-9\">The Court of Appeals majority reached only the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>multiple-object challenge and affirmed the circuit court decisions.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b680-4\">We would hold that both art 4, \u00a7 24 challenges of the statute are without merit, and reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-5\">1</p>\n<p id=\"b680-6\">MULTIPLE-OBJECT CHALLENGE</p>\n<p id=\"b680-7\">The purpose of the constitutional provision now found in art 4, \u00a7 24 was stated by Justice Cooley fifteen years after such language was included in the Constitution of 1850:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b680-8\">The history and purpose of this constitutional provision are too well understood to require any elucidation at our hands. The practice of bringing together into one bill subjects diverse in their nature, and having no necessary connection, with a view to combine in their favor the advocates of all, and thus secure the passage of several measures, no one of which could succeed upon its own merits, was one both corruptive of the legislator and dangerous to the state. It was scarcely more so, however, than another practice, also intended to be remedied by this provision, by which, through dexterous management, clauses were inserted in bills of which the titles gave no intimation, and their passage secured through legislative bodies whose members were not generally aware of their intention and effect. There was no design by this clause to embarrass legislation by making laws unnecessarily restrictive in their scope and operation, and thus multiplying their number; but the framers of the constitution meant to put an end to legislation of the vicious character referred to, which was little less than a fraud upon the public, and to require that in every case the proposed measure should stand upon its own merits, and that the legislature should be fairly notified of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>its design when required to pass upon it. <em>[People ex rel Drake v Mahaney, </em>13 Mich 481, 494-495 (1865).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b681-4\">The provision is not meant to be applied restrictively. <em>Kuhn v Treasury Dep\u2019t, </em>384 Mich 378, 387-388; 183 NW2d 796 (1971). See also <em>Local No 644 v Oakwood Hosp Corp, </em>367 Mich 79, 91; 116 NW2d 314 (1962):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b681-5\">Numerous cases have held that the \"object\u201d of a statute is the general purpose or aim of the enactment. The legislature may empower a body created by it to do everything requisite, necessary, or expedient to carry out the principal objective to be attained. Legislation, if it has a primary object, is not invalid because it embraces more than 1 means of attaining its primary object. <em>In re Brewster Street Housing Site, </em>291 Mich 313 [289 NW 493 (1939)].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b681-6\">With all but the simplest of statutes, it would be possible to select one section, describe the \"object\u201d of that section, and be able to reason, as the Court of Appeals majority did in this case, that the remaining sections have different objects. The flaw in this approach is in defining the object of 1992 PA 270 as being limited to the content of the bill as originally introduced. The Court of Appeals said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b681-7\">The original purpose of HB 4501, as expressed in both the title and body of the bill, was to create a new public act to study certain issues related to death and dying. This bill had no regulatory authority. When HB 4501 was amended to add the substance of SB 32, the additional provisions had another and different objective\u2014to amend the Penal Code to create the crime of criminal assistance to suicide. [205 Mich App 194, 201-202; 518 NW2d 487 (1994).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b682-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>In so reasoning, the Court of Appeals majority confused the analysis to be used in multiple-object cases with that appropriate in assessing a challenge based on a change of purpose theory. The object of the legislation must be determined by examining the law as enacted, not as originally introduced.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-4\">We would find the instant statute clearly to embrace only one object.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> While the cases cited by the parties involving multiple-object challenges concern quite different statutes, an examination of those cases that have found multiple-object violations<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> and those that have not<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> demonstrates that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>the instant case falls squarely within the category of permissible joining of statutory provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-4\">The Court of Appeals majority sought to distinguish <em>People v Trupiano, </em>97 Mich App 416; 296 NW2d 49 (1980), on which the prosecutors relied, on the ground that the statute in question in that case (the Public Health Code)<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> involved a legislative enactment constituting a \"code.\u201d<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> However, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>there is no \"code exception\u201d in art 4, \u00a7 24. Rather, the cases upholding codes against multiple-object challenges are at most an extension of the liberality with which such challenges are reviewed.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-4\">The Court of Appeals majority suggested that the Legislature could have included the provisions regarding the commission and the criminal penalties in the same bill if it had used a more general title:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b684-5\">Had the Legislature intended to codify or regulate the general \"subject\u201d of assisted suicide, it could have notified the public of this intention by declaring a single broad purpose and by joining the object contained in HB 4501 with the object contained in SB 32 together in one bill. This the Legislature did not do. This failure resulted in the body of the act containing two distinct objects. The fact that the title was amended to reflect the addition of \u00a7 7 does not cure the constitutional infirmity. The one-object provision may not be circumvented by creating a title that includes different legislative objects. <em>Hildebrand v Revco Discount Drug Centers, </em>137 Mich App 1, 11; 357 NW2d 778 (1984). [205 Mich App 202-203.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b684-6\">This emphasis on the title is misplaced. It cannot be said that a statute has two objects if its title specifically describes its content, but only one if the title is general. Insofar as one of the purposes of the Title-Object Clause is to provide notice of the content of a bill to the Legislature and the public, a more specific title better achieves that purpose, particularly regarding a fairly short bill like the one in this case. Elsewhere in its opinion, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>the Court of Appeals majority itself recognized that one looks to the body of the act, not the title, to determine whether it has a single object:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b685-4\">While the object must be expressed in the title, the body of the law must be examined to determine whether it embraces more than one object. <em>Kent Co ex rel Bd of Supervisors of Kent Co v </em>Reed, 243 Mich 120, 122; 219 NW 656 (1928). [205 Mich App 199.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b685-5\">The <em>Hobbins </em>plaintiffs and defendant Kevorkian also argue that there was a multiple-object violation because the provisions could have been enacted in separate bills. They rely on <em>Advisory Opinion on Constitutionality of 1975 PA 227 (Question 1), </em>396 Mich 123, 129; 240 NW2d 193 (1976):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b685-6\">\"The provisions in these two sections might have been enacted in separate laws without either of them in any way referring to or affecting the other.\u201d [Quoting <em>Kent Co ex rel Bd of Supervisors v Reed, supra </em>at 122.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b685-7\">This principle is unsound. There is virtually no statute that could not be subdivided and enacted as several bills. It is precisely that kind of \"multiplying\u201d of legislation that we s\u00e9ek to avoid with the liberal construction given to art 4, \u00a7 24.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b685-8\">Accordingly, we would hold that the assisted suicide statute embraces only one object and thus was validly enacted._</p>\n<p id=\"b686-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>2</p>\n<p id=\"b686-4\">CHANGE IN PURPOSE CHALLENGE<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b686-5\">The <em>Hobbins </em>plaintiffs also challenge the statute on the ground that its purpose was changed during its passage through the Legislature. They point to <em>Anderson v Oakland Co Clerk, </em>419 Mich 313, 329; 353 NW2d 448 (1984), as establishing that the objectives of that provision are to \"preclude last-minute, hasty legislation and to provide notice to the public of legislation under consideration . . . .\u201d The provision is integrally related to the \"five-day rule\u201d of art 4, \u00a7 26, which states that no bill can be passed until it has been printed or reproduced and in the possession of each house for at least five days. They maintain that those principles have been violated in this statute. After the bill was introduced, the Legislature amended HB 4501 to add a provision criminalizing assisted suicide. The <em>Hobbins </em>plaintiffs say that this amendment dramatically changed the purpose of the original bill, which was to create a study commission. Thus, it is argued, the Legislature was able to enact a law making assisted suicide a criminal offense without giving the people an opportunity to be heard on this highly charged and emotional issue. Looking at the legislative calendar for the day on which the amendment was made, the <em>Hob-bins </em>plaintiffs find reference only to an act to create the Commission on Death and Dying.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-6\">In response to the prosecuting authorities\u2019 argument that the later enactment of 1993 PA 3 cured the defect, the plaintiffs maintain that the argument is \"structurally unsound\u201d and misstates the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>effect of the reenactment of an amended law. They contend that the constitutional violation was complete when 1992 PA 270 was enacted, and that 1993 PA 3 merely amended the former act in minor respects and gave it immediate effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-4\">The argument by the plaintiffs fails to take into account that the criminal penalties for assistance to suicide were an interim measure tied to the Legislature\u2019s continuing consideration of issues related to death and dying, including those to be covered in the report of the commission. Thus, the penalties can be viewed as simply providing a stable environment while the Commission on Death and Dying, the Legislature, and the citizenry studied these questions further.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-5\">Moreover, cases interpreting the change of purpose clause indicate that the test for determining if an amendment or substitute changes a purpose of the bill is whether the subject matter of the amendment or substitute is germane to the original purpose.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> The test of germaneness is much like the standard for determining whether a bill is limited to a single object. As we held above, the creation of the commission and the provision of criminal penalties were appropriately placed in the same bill.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-6\">We also agree with the prosecuting authorities that any problems with the enactment of 1992 PA 270 were eliminated with the enactment of 1993 PA 3. The plaintiffs do not claim that the later act is independently subject to attack on a change of purpose ground. It is a basic principle of statutory construction that an amending statute replaces the former provisions. As we explained in <em>Lahti v </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>Fosterling, 357 Mich 578, 587-588; 99 NW2d 490 (1959):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b688-4\">This Court in <em>People v Lowell, </em>250 Mich 349, 354-356 [230 NW 202] (1930), said:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b688-5\">\"An amendatory act has a repealing force, by the mechanics of legislation, different from that of an independent statute.

The enacting clause stated that those sections were \"amended to read as follows . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"A94\">Further, it is clear that an amending statute can remedy a constitutional defect in the original act. As noted in 1A Singer, Sutherland Statutory Construction (5th ed), \u00a7 22.04, p 182, \"[s]ome courts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>have indicated that an unconstitutional act is legally nonexistent and cannot be given effect by an attempt to amend it.\u201d However, as the treatise goes on to explain:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b689-4\">A majority of courts seem to have rejected the theory that an unconstitutional act has no existence, at least for the purpose of amendment. The unconstitutional act physically exists in the official statutes of the state and is available for reference, and as it is only unenforceable, the purported amendment is given effect. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b689-5\">This escape from the legal fiction that an unconstitutional act does not exist is sound. That fiction serves only as a convenient method of stating that an unconstitutional act gives no rights or imposes no duties. . . .

The statute under which defendant Kevorkian has been charged is MCL 752.1027; MSA 28.547(127), as amended by 1993 PA 3, which was not enacted in violation of the change of purpose clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-7\">Accordingly, we would hold that the assisted suicide provisions of MCL 752.1027; MSA 28.547(127) are not void by reason of violation of Const 1963, art 4, \u00a7 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-8\">v</p>\n<p id=\"b689-9\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b689-10\">Having found that Michigan\u2019s assisted suicide <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>statute does not violate Const 1963, art 4, \u00a7 24, we now address whether the statute runs afoul of the United States Constitution. In its opinion of May 10, 1994, the Court of Appeals rejected this argument. So do we.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-4\">The Due Process Clause of US Const, Am XIV commands the states not to \"deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law . . . .\u201d Thus, the threshold question in this case is whether the clause encompasses a fundamental right to commit suicide and, if so, whether it includes a right to assistance.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b690-6\">Those who assert that there is such a right rely heavily on decisions of the United States Supreme Court in abortion and so-called \"right to die\u201d cases. Focusing especially on <em>Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania v Casey, </em>505 US 833; 112 S Ct 2791; 120 L Ed 2d 674 (1992), and <em>Cruzan v Director, Missouri Dep\u2019t of Health, </em>497 US 261; 110 S Ct 2841; 111 L Ed 2d 224 (1990), these advocates argue that the right to end one\u2019s own life is a fundamental liberty interest, grounded in the notion of personal autonomy and springing from common-law concepts of bodily integrity and informed consent. They further contend that an integral part of this protected interest is the right to assistance, hence the term \"assisted suicide.\u201d<footnotemark>27</footnotemark>_</p>\n<p id=\"b691-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>We do not discern in <em>Cruzan </em>and its historic roots an indication that the federal constitution protects a right more expansive than the right to refuse to begin or to continue life-sustaining medical treatment. Neither do we find in <em>Casey </em>or in the precedent from which it evolved an intent to expand the liberty interests identified by the Court in such a manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-4\">c</p>\n<p id=\"b691-5\"><em>Cruzan </em>was the first case to present to the United States Supreme Court the issue whether the federal constitution grants a so-called \"right to die.\u201d<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> 497 US 277. The Court was asked in <em>Cruzan </em>to decide the validity of a state statute that prohibited a Missouri couple from halting the artificial nutrition and hydration of their brain-damaged daughter, absent clear and convincing evidence of her wishes.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-6\">In upholding the Missouri statute, the majority observed that the constitutional right of a competent person to refuse unwanted medical treatment could be inferred from prior Supreme Court decisions.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> 497 US 278. For purposes of analysis, the Court \"assumed\u201d that there also was a constitu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>tional right to halt lifesaving hydration and nutrition. However, the Court emphasized that such a liberty interest would have to be balanced against relevant state interests. The interests advanced in Cruzan\u2014the preservation of life<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> and the safeguarding of an incompetent person\u2019s wishes against potential abuses\u2014were found sufficient to sustain the evidentiary requirement.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b692-4\"><em>Casey </em>was decided two years after <em>Cruzan. </em>There, the Court was asked to decide the validity of a Pennsylvania abortion statute that included an \"informed consent\u201d requirement, a waiting period, and a \"spousal notification\u201d provision. In upholding all but the notification provision,<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>Court reaffirmed the essential tenet of <em>Roe v Wade, </em>410 US 113; 93 S Ct 705; 35 L Ed 2d 147 (1973), reh den 410 US 959 (1973), which includes recognition of a woman\u2019s right under the Due Process Clause to terminate a pregnancy in its early stages, without undue interference from the state. That right is protected by \"a promise of the Constitution that there is a realm of personal liberty which the government may not enter.\u201d 120 L Ed 2d 695.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-4\">The <em>Casey </em>Court explained that <em>Roe </em>\"stands at the intersection of two lines of decisions . . . .\u201d 120 L Ed 2d 701. Although this holding of <em>Roe </em>was grounded in a liberty interest relating to intimate relationships, the family, and childbearing, <em>Roe </em>also may be seen as a rule \"of personal autonomy and bodily integrity, with doctrinal affinity to cases recognizing limits on governmental power to mandate medical treatment or to bar its rejection.\u201d 120 L Ed 2d 702. The choice of doctrinal category made no difference to the result in <em>Casey, </em>the Court said. It added that <em>Roe </em>also could be classified as sui generis. <em>Id. </em>at 701-702.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-5\">Drawing from <em>Cruzan </em>and <em>Casey, </em>the <em>Hobbins </em>plaintiffs<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> and defendant Kevorkian advance several theories why this Court should find that there <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>is a protected liberty interest in assisted suicide, at least with regard to the terminally ill.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> All the theories, of course, assume a fundamental liberty interest in suicide itself.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b694-4\">The parties contend that the right to assistance in ending one\u2019s life is an integral part of \"personal autonomy.\u201d<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> They emphasize that the <em>Casey </em>Court rejected a \"formula\u201d approach to deciding which rights are protected by the Fourteenth Amendment, and also the notion that new rights cannot emerge. Instead, the Court described the characteristics that are shared by protected \"liberty\u201d interests:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b694-5\">These matters [marriage, procreation, contraception, family relationships, child rearing, and education], involving the most intimate and personal choices a person may make in a lifetime, choices central to personal dignity and autonomy, are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>central to the liberty protected by the Fourteenth Amendment. At the heart of liberty is the right to define one\u2019s own concept of existence, of meaning, of the universe, and of the mystery of human life. Beliefs about these matters could not define the attributes of personhood were they formed under compulsion of the State. [120 L Ed 2d 698.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b695-4\">The proponents of assisted suicide further argue that the right to commit suicide is analogous to the right to refuse unwanted medical treatment, to discontinue life support, to use contraception, and to choose abortion. They submit that the decision to end one\u2019s life is the ultimate right of self-determination, and that the state cannot abridge the right unless it can articulate a compelling interest.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b695-5\">The advocates of assisted suicide ask us to adopt the reasoning of a recent federal decision that invalidated the State of Washington\u2019s criminal prohibition against assisted suicide. The court held in <em>Compassion in Dying v Washington, </em>850 F Supp 1454, 1461 (WD Wash, 1994),<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> that the right of a terminally ill person to the assistance of a physician in committing suicide is analogous to the right of abortion because both fall within the \" 'realm of personal liberty which the government may not enter.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>39</footnotemark>_</p>\n<p id=\"b696-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>The federal court found that the rationale in <em>Casey </em>was \"almost prescriptive\u201d of the right to end one\u2019s life. The court held that, under <em>Casey, </em>the state cannot proscribe assisted suicide if such a ban would unduly burden the right to commit suicide, i.e., if the purpose of the ban is to place a substantial obstacle in the path of the person seeking to exercise the right.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-4\">The federal court also found that the right of a terminally ill person to commit suicide with assistance does not differ in a constitutional sense from the right recognized in <em>Cruzan </em>to refuse life-sustaining medical treatment.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> The essential premise of the court\u2019s holding was that, in each instance, the liberty interest is \"the freedom to make choices according to one\u2019s individual conscience about those matters which are essential to personal autonomy and basic human dignity.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1461.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b696-5\">We disagree with the federal court that either <em>Cruzan </em>or <em>Casey </em>preordains that the Supreme Court would find that any persons, including the terminally ill, have a liberty interest in suicide that is protected by the Fourteenth Amendment. Those who assert such a right misapprehend the nature of the holdings in those cases._</p>\n<p id=\"b697-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>D</p>\n<p id=\"b697-4\">In <em>Cruzan, </em>the Court was able to \"assume\u201d a protected liberty interest in the withdrawal of life-sustaining medical treatment because it was able to distinguish between acts that artificially sustain life and acts that artificially curtail life. Although some suggest that this is a distinction without constitutional significance\u2014a meaningless exercise in semantic gymnastics\u2014the <em>Cruzan </em>majority disagreed<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> and so do we.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-5\">Indeed, the notion that there is a difference between action and inaction is not unfamiliar to the law. For example, the distinction between \"misfeasance\u201d and \"nonfeasance\u201d (the distinction between active misconduct and passive inaction) is deeply rooted in the law of negligence. The reason for the distinction is said to lie in the fact that a defendant creates a new risk of harm by misfeasance, but merely fails to benefit another by nonfeasance. As Dean Prosser explains, the duty to do no wrong is a legal duty, while the duty to. protect against wrong is, for the most part, a moral obligation. Prosser &amp; Keeton, Torts (5th ed), \u00a7 56, pp 373-374.<footnotemark>43</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b697-6\">Similarly, whereas suicide involves an affirmative act to end a life, the refusal or cessation of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>life-sustaining medical treatment simply permits life to run its course, unencumbered by contrived intervention. Put another way, suicide frustrates the natural course by introducing an outside agent to accelerate death, whereas the refusal or withdrawal of life-sustaining medical treatment allows nature to proceed, i.e., death occurs because of the underlying condition.<footnotemark>44</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b698-4\">The distinction between the withdrawal of life-sustaining medical treatment and suicide is recognized in the <em>Guidelines for State Court Decision Making In Life-Sustaining Medical Treatment, </em>National Center for State Courts (2d ed), pp 143-145 (1992). The guidelines include the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b698-5\">There are significant moral and legal distinctions between letting die (including the use of medications to relieve suffering during the dying process) and killing (assisted suicide/euthanasia). In letting die, the cause of death is seen as the underlying disease process or trauma. In assisted suicide/euthanasia, the cause of death is seen as the inherently lethal action itself.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b698-7\">We agree that persons who opt to discontinue life-sustaining medical treatment are not, in effect, committing suicide. There is a difference between choosing a natural death summoned by an uninvited illness or calamity, and deliberately seeking <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>to terminate one\u2019s life by resorting to death-inducing measures unrelated to the natural process of dying. <em>McKay v Bergstedt, </em>106 Nev 808, 820; 801 P2d 617 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b699-4\">In affirming a lower court decision to discontinue artificial sustenance for a profoundly retarded woman who was in a persistent vegetative state, the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts similarly emphasized the \"well-settled\u201d principle that withdrawing or refusing life-sustaining medical treatment is not equivalent to attempting suicide. <em>Guardianship of Jane Doe, </em>411 Mass 512, 521; 583 NE2d 1263 (1992), cert den sub nom <em>Doe v Gross, </em>503 US 950 (1992). The vigorous dissents in <em>Doe </em>were not offered in support of a broader right to die, but rather in recognition of the state\u2019s paramount interest in protecting life.<footnotemark>45</footnotemark>_</p>\n<p id=\"ATU\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number><em>in </em>its first case involving the cessation of life-sustaining medical treatment, the Kentucky Supreme Court found that withdrawal of nutrition and hydration from a person in a persistent vegetative state, and with irreversible brain damage, fits the medical definition of \"permit[ting] the natural process of dying.\u201d <em>DeGrella v Elston, </em>858 SW2d 698, 707 (Ky, 1993). The court cautioned that it was not engaging in \"an objective inquiry into the quality of life, but a subjective inquiry into whether the patient wishes the continuation of medical procedures to interdict 'the natural process of dying.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b700-3\">At the point where the withdrawal of life-prolonging medical treatment becomes solely another person\u2019s decision about the patient\u2019s quality of life, the individual\u2019s \"inalienable right to life,\u201d as so declared in the United States Declaration of Independence and protected by Section One (1) of our Kentucky Constitution, outweighs any consideration of the quality of the life, or the value of the life, at stake. <em>[Id. </em>at 702.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b700-4\">These and other recent decisions of the highest courts of other states bolster our conclusion that <em>Cruzan </em>does not portend that the United States Supreme Court would find a fundamental liberty interest in suicide, let alone assisted suicide, that is protected by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-5\">E</p>\n<p id=\"b700-6\">1</p>\n<p id=\"b700-7\">Neither does <em>Casey </em>provide support for the posi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>tion that the Due Process Clause encompasses a fundamental right to commit suicide. In <em>Casey, </em>the Court was not directly concerned with the establishment of a new right, but rather with whether the Court should retreat from the right previously recognized in <em>Roe v Wade. </em>In declining to overrule <em>Roe, </em>and relying heavily on the doctrine of stare decisis, the Court emphasized that abortion cases are unique. 120 L Ed 2d 698.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-4\">Although the Court in <em>Casey </em>was not called upon to determine the merits of a newly asserted due process right, it is well settled that the Due Process Clause shelters both procedural and substantive rights. <em>Casey, </em>120 L Ed 2d 695. The latter includes those rights that have been selectively incorporated from the Bill of Rights, and those that have been found to be \"fundamental.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b701-5\">The state argues that in determining those fundamental rights not expressly identified in, but nonetheless protected by, the Due Process Clause, the analysis must be guided by a search for whether the asserted right is implicit in the concept of ordered liberty or deeply rooted in our nation\u2019s history and traditions. See <em>Palko v Connecticut, </em>302 US 319, 325-326; 58 S Ct 149; 82 L Ed 288 (1937), and <em>Snyder v Massachusetts, </em>291 US 97, 105; 54 S Ct 330; 78 L Ed 674 (1934).<footnotemark>46</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b701-6\">Those who urge this Court to find a fundamental liberty interest in suicide under the Due Process Clause challenge the traditional analysis, arguing that the United States Supreme Court articulated in <em>Casey </em>a new, broader inquiry to be employed in the adjudication of substantive due process claims. They submit that even if such a right cannot be inferred from <em>Casey, </em>it nonetheless exists as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>rational extension of those liberty interests previously recognized under a principled application of the proper test for determining whether an asserted right is protected by the Due Process Clause.<footnotemark>47</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b702-4\">We acknowledge that the United States Supreme Court said in <em>Casey </em>that courts are to exercise reasoned judgment in assessing claims of substantive due process, and that the analysis is \"not susceptible of expression as a simple rule.\u201d 120 L Ed 2d 697. However, we need not resolve the debate over whether the Court established a new test because further examination of the principles discussed in <em>Casey </em>reveals that the constitutional inquiry described in that case does not fall so far outside the \"implicit in the concept of ordered liberty\u201d and \"deeply rooted in history and tradition\u201d analysis as to lead to a different conclusion here.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-5\">Thus, in the present context, consistent with the observations of Justice Harlan<footnotemark>48</footnotemark> quoted approv<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>ingly and expanded upon in <em>Casey, </em>120 L Ed 2d 697-698, we must determine whether the asserted right to commit suicide arises from a rational evolution of tradition, or whether recognition of such a right would be a radical departure from historical precepts. We conclude that the principles that guide analysis of substantive due process do not support the recognition of a right to commit suicide.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-4\">2</p>\n<p id=\"b703-5\">Although acts of suicide are documented throughout the recorded history of England and this nation, we find no indication of widespread societal approval.

Marzen, O\u2019Dowd, Crone &amp; Balch, <em>Suicide: A constitutional right?, </em>24 Duq L R 1, 63, 69, 85-86, 88-89 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b703-7\">One who assisted a suicide was accorded no such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>concession, however.<footnotemark>50</footnotemark> At the time the Fourteenth Amendment was ratified, at least twenty-one of the thirty-seven existing states (including eighteen of the thirty ratifying states) proscribed assisted suicide either by statute or as a common-law offense. <em>Id. </em>at 76.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-4\">Presently, a substantial number of jurisdictions have specific statutes that criminalize assisted suicide,<footnotemark>51</footnotemark> and the Model Penal Code also provides for criminal penalties.<footnotemark>52</footnotemark> Further, nearly all states ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>pressly disapprove of suicide and assisted suicide either in statutes dealing with durable powers of attorney in health-care situations,<footnotemark>53</footnotemark> or in \"living will\u201d statutes.<footnotemark>54</footnotemark> In addition, all states provide for the involuntary commitment of persons who may harm themselves as the result of mental illness,<footnotemark>55</footnotemark> and a number of states allow the use of nondeadly force to thwart suicide attempts.<footnotemark>56</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b706-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>It is thus incorrect to conclude, on the basis of the absence of criminal penalties for an act of suicide itself and the existence of a pragmatic capacity to commit suicide, that there is a constitutional right to commit suicide.<footnotemark>57</footnotemark> Such a right is not expressly recognized anywhere in the United States Constitution or in the decisions of the United States Supreme Court, and cannot be reasonably inferred.<footnotemark>58</footnotemark> In fact, as we observed earlier in this opinion, those courts that have found a right to refuse to begin or to continue life-sustaining medical treatment have done so only after concluding that such refusal is wholly different from an act of suicide.<footnotemark>59</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b706-4\">Indeed, the United States Supreme Court repeatedly and unequivocally has affirmed the sanctity of human life and rejected the notion that there is a right of self-destruction inherent in any common-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>law doctrine or constitutional phrase. In <em>Cruzan, </em>the majority observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b707-4\">As a general matter, the States\u2014indeed, all civilized nations\u2014demonstrate their commitment to life by treating homicide as a serious crime.

We do not think a State is required to remain neutral in the face of an informed and voluntary decision by a physically able adult to starve to death. [497 US 280.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b707-5\">On the basis of the foregoing analysis, we would hold that the right to commit suicide is neither implicit in the concept of ordered liberty nor deeply rooted in this nation\u2019s history and tradition. It would be an impermissibly radical departure from existing tradition, and from the principles that underlie that tradition, to declare that there is such a fundamental right protected by the Due Process Clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-6\">F</p>\n<p id=\"b707-7\">We are keenly aware of the intense emotions and competing moral philosophies that characterize the present debate about suicide in general, and assisted suicide in particular.

Their deaths occurred before the enactment of Michigan\u2019s ban on assisted suicide, and the question is whether defendant Kevorkian can be prosecuted for his role in the deaths.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-8\">Each woman was said to be suffering from a condition that caused her great pain or was severely disabling. Each separately had sought defendant Kevorkian\u2019s assistance in ending her life. The women and several friends and relatives met <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>the defendant at a cabin in Oakland County on October 23, 1991.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-4\">According to the testimony presented at the defendant\u2019s preliminary examination, the plan was to use his \"suicide machine.\u201d The device consisted of a board to which one\u2019s arm is strapped to prevent movement, a needle to be inserted into a blood vessel and attached to iv tubing, and containers of various chemicals that are to be released through the needle into the bloodstream. Strings are tied to two of the fingers of the person who intends to die. The strings are attached to clips on the iv tubing that control the flow of the chemicals. As explained by one witness, the person raises that hand, releasing a drug called methohexital, which was described by expert witnesses as a fast-acting barbiturate that is used under controlled circumstances to administer anesthesia rapidly.<footnotemark>61</footnotemark> When the person falls asleep, the hand drops, pulling the other string, which releases another clip and allows potassium chloride to flow into the body in concentrations sufficient to cause death.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-5\">The defendant tried several times, without success, to insert the suicide-machine needle into Ms. Miller\u2019s arm and hand. He then left the cabin, returning several hours later with a cylinder of carbon monoxide gas and a mask apparatus. He attached a screw driver to the cylinder, and showed Ms. Miller how to use the tool as a lever to open the gas valve.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-6\">The defendant then turned his attention to Ms. Wantz. He was successful in inserting the suicide-machine needle into her arm. The defendant explained to Ms. Wantz how to activate the device so <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>as to allow the drugs to enter her bloodstream. The device was activated,<footnotemark>62</footnotemark> and Ms. Wantz died.<footnotemark>63</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b710-4\">The defendant then placed the mask apparatus on Ms. Miller. The only witness at the preliminary examination who was present at the time said that Ms. Miller opened the gas valve by pulling on the screw driver. The cause of her death was determined to be carbon-monoxide poisoning.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-5\">The defendant was indicted on two counts of open murder. He was bound over for trial following a preliminary examination. However, in circuit court, the defendant moved to quash the information and dismiss the charges, and the court granted the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b710-7\">A divided Court of Appeals reversed. <em>People v </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number><em>Kevorkian No 1, </em>205 Mich App 180; 517 NW2d 293 (1994). The Court of Appeals majority relied principally on <em>People v Roberts, </em>211 Mich 187; 178 NW 690 (1920).</p>\n<p id=\"b711-4\">In <em>Roberts, </em>the defendant\u2019s wife was suffering from advanced multiple sclerosis and in great pain. She previously had attempted suicide and, according to the defendant\u2019s statements at the plea proceeding, requested that he provide her with poison. He agreed, and placed a glass of poison within her reach. She drank the mixture and died. The defendant was charged with murder. He pleaded guilty, and the trial court determined the crime to be murder in the first degree.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-5\">The defendant appealed. He argued, among other things, that because suicide is not a crime in Michigan, and his wife thus committed no offense, he committed none in acting as an accessory before the fact. The Court rejected that argument, explaining:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Anj\">If we were living in a purely common-law atmosphere with a strictly common-law practice, and defendant were charged with being guilty as an accessory of the offense of suicide, counsel\u2019s argument would be more persuasive than it is. But defendant is not charged with that offense. He is charged with murder and the theory of the people was that he committed the crime by means of poison. He has come into court and confessed that he mixed poison with water and placed it within her reach, but at her request. The important question, therefore, arises as to whether what defendant did constitutes murder by means of poison. [211 Mich 195.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b711-7\">After discussing a similar Ohio case, <em>Blackburn </em>v <em>State, </em>23 Ohio St 146 (1872), the <em>Roberts </em>Court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b712-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>We are of the opinion that when defendant mixed the paris green with water and placed it within reach of his wife to enable her to put an end to her suffering by putting an end to her life, he was guilty of murder by means of poison within the meaning of the statute, even though she requested him to do so. By this act he deliberately placed within her reach the means of taking her own life, which she could have obtained in no other way by reason of her helpless condition. [211 Mich 198]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b712-4\">In the instant case, defendant Kevorkian had argued that the discussion of this issue in <em>Roberts </em>was dicta because the defendant in that case had pleaded guilty of murder, and thus the controlling authority was <em>People v Campbell, </em>124 Mich App 333; 335 NW2d 27 (1983).<footnotemark>64</footnotemark> The Court of Appeals majority rejected that view and said thht <em>Roberts </em>controlled the issue presented in the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-5\">c</p>\n<p id=\"b712-6\">We agree with the Court of Appeals that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>holding in <em>Roberts </em>was not dicta.<footnotemark>65</footnotemark> While it is true that defendant Roberts pleaded guilty of placing a poisonous mixture at the bedside of his sick wife, knowing that she intended to use it to commit suicide, nothing in the opinion indicates that this Court based its affirmance of the conviction of first-degree murder on the fact that the conviction stemmed from a guilty plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-4\">However, it is not sufficient in the instant case to decide simply that the holding in <em>Roberts </em>was not dicta. We must determine further whether <em>Roberts </em>remains viable, because, as noted in <em>People v Stevenson, </em>416 Mich 383, 390; 331 NW2d 143 (1982):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b713-5\">This Court has often recognized its authority, and indeed its duty, to change the common law when change is required[<footnotemark>66</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b713-6\">The crime of murder has been classified and categorized by the Legislature, see MCL 750.316; MSA 28.548 and MCL 750.317; MSA 28.549, but the definition of murder has been left to the common law. <em>People v Aaron, </em>409 Mich 672; 299 NW2d 304 (1980); <em>People v Scott, </em>6 Mich 287 (1859). Unless abrogated by the constitution, the Legislature, or this Court, the common law ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>plies. Const 1963, art 3, \u00a7 7; <em>Aaron, supra </em>at 722-723.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-4\">Under the common-law definition, \" '[m]urder is where a person of sound memory and discretion unlawfully kills any reasonable creature in being, in peace of the state, with malice prepense or aforethought, either express or implied.\u2019 \u201d <em>Aaron, supra </em>at 713, quoting <em>People v Potter, </em>5 Mich 1 (1858). Implicit in this definition is a finding that the defendant performed an act that caused the death of another. To convict a defendant of criminal homicide, it must be proven that death occurred as a direct and natural result of the defendant\u2019s act. <em>People v Barnes, </em>182 Mich 179, 196; 148 NW 400 (1914). See also <em>People v Flenon, </em>42 Mich App 457, 460; 202 NW2d 471 (1972) (\"a defendant\u2019s [first-degree murder] conviction should only be sustained where there is a reasonable and direct causal connection between the injury and death\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b714-5\">Early decisions indicate that a murder conviction may be based on merely providing the means by which another commits suicide.<footnotemark>67</footnotemark> However, few jurisdictions, if any, have retained the early common-law view that assisting in a suicide is murder. The modern statutory scheme in the majority of states treats assisted suicide as a separate crime, with penalties less onerous than those for murder. See, e.g., 1993 PA 3, which was enacted by our own Legislature.<footnotemark>68</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b715-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>Recent decisions draw a distinction between active participation in a suicide and involvement in the events leading up to the suicide, such as providing the means. Frequently, these cases arise in the context of a claim by the defendant that the prosecution should have been brought under an assisted suicide statute. The courts generally have held that a person may be prosecuted for murder if the person\u2019s acts went beyond the conduct that the assisted suicide statute was intended to cover.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-4\">For example, in <em>People v Cleaves, </em>229 Cal App 3d 367; 280 Cal Rptr 146 (1991), the defendant was charged with first-degree murder in the strangulation death of another man. The trial court had refused a defense request to instruct the jury on the statutory offense of aiding and abetting a suicide, and the jury convicted him of second-degree murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-5\">In deciding whether an instruction on the statu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>tory offense of aiding and abetting suicide should have been given, the appellate court accepted the defendant\u2019s detailed version of the events. The decedent in <em>Cleaves </em>was suffering from aids and wanted the defendant\u2019s assistance in strangling himself. With the defendant\u2019s help, the decedent trussed his body in an arched position, with his face down on a pillow. The defendant\u2019s role, when the decedent \"pulled down\u201d on the truss to effect strangulation, was to put his hand on the decedent\u2019s back to steady him. At one point, when the sash slipped from the decedent\u2019s neck, the defendant rewrapped it at the decedent\u2019s request and retied it to the decedent\u2019s hands. By straightening out his body with his feet, the decedent was in sole control of how tight the sash was around his neck. In holding that the trial judge properly refused to instruct the jury under the assisted suicide statute, the appeals court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-4\">[The statute] provides: \"Every person who deliberately aids, or advises, or encourages another to commit suicide, is guilty of a felony.\u201d As explained by our Supreme Court, the \"key to distinguishing between the crimes of murder and of assisting suicide is the active or passive role of the defendant in the suicide. If the defendant merely furnishes the means, he is guilty of aiding a suicide; if he actively participates in the death of the suicide victim, he is guilty of murder.\u201d <em>[In re Joseph G, </em>34 Cal 3d 429, 436; 194 Cal Rptr 163; 667 P2d 1176; 40 ALR4th 690 (1983).] The statute providing for a crime less than murder \" 'does not contemplate active participation by one in the overt act directly' causing death. It contemplates some participation in the events leading up to the commission of the final overt act, such as furnishing the means for bringing about death, the gun, the knife, the poison, or providing the water, for the use of the person who himself commits the act of self-murder. But where a person actually per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>forms, or actively assists in performing, the overt act resulting in death, such as shooting or stabbing the victim, administering the poison, or holding, one under water until death takes place by drowning, his act constitutes murder, and it is wholly immaterial whether this act is committed pursuant to an agreement with the victim <em>[People v Matlock, </em>51 Cal 2d 682, 694; 336 P2d 505; 71 ALR2d 605 (1959).] [229 Cal App 3d 375.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b717-5\">In <em>Cleaves, </em>viewing the evidence most favorably for the defense, the court said there were no facts to support the requested instruction on aiding and abetting an assisted suicide. Although the defendant may not have applied pressure to the ligature itself, he admitted that his act of holding the decedent to keep him from falling off the bed was designed to assist the decedent in completing an act of strangulation. \"This factual scenario indisputably shows active assistance in the overt act of strangulation,\u201d the court said. <em>Id. </em>at 376.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-6\">Similarly, in <em>State v Sexson, </em>117 NM 113; 869 P2d 301 (NM App, 1994), cert den 117 NM 215 (1994), the defendant was charged with first-degree murder in connection with the fatal shooting of his wife. He was convicted of second-degree murder following a bench trial, and argued on appeal that he should have been prosecuted under the state\u2019s assisted suicide statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-7\">The only fact in dispute in <em>Sexson </em>was whether it was the defendant or the decedent who actually pulled the trigger of the rifle that killed her. It was not disputed that there was a suicide agreement between the two, and that the pact was genuine. The defendant claimed simply to have held the rifle in position while the decedent pulled the trigger, and that he had failed to then kill himself because he \"freaked out\u201d when the decedent continued to breathe after being shot.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>The appellate court rejected the defendant\u2019s argument that he could not be prosecuted under the more general murder statute because of the specific assisted suicide statute. In so doing, the court emphasized that the two statutes proscribed different conduct:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b718-4\">The wrongful act triggering criminal liability for the offense of assisting suicide is \"aiding another\u201d in the taking of his or her own life. It is well accepted that \"aiding,\u201d in the context of determining whether one is criminally liable for. their involvement in the suicide of another, is intended to mean providing the means to commit suicide, not actively performing the act which results in death. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b718-5\">There are three different views about the criminal liability of one who, whether pursuant to a suicide pact or not, solicits (by talk) or aids (as by providing the means of self-destruction) another to commit suicide. Occasionally aiding or soliciting suicide has been held to be no crime at all on the ground that suicide is not criminal. That view is most certainly unsound. At one time many jurisdictions held it to be murder, but a great many states now deal specifically with causing or aiding suicide by statute, treating it either as a form of manslaughter or as a separate crime. Such statutes typically do \"not contemplate active participation by one in the overt act directly causing death,\u201d and thus their existence is not barrier to a murder conviction in such circumstances.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b718-6\">In contrast, the wrongful act triggering criminal liability for second degree murder is \"kill[ing]\u201d or \"caus[ing] the death\u201d of another. In the context of the instant case, the second degree murder statute is aimed at preventing an individual from actively causing the death of someone contemplating suicide, whereas the assisting suicide statute is aimed at preventing an individual from providing someone contemplating suicide with the means to commit suicide. Thus, the two statutes do not condemn <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>the same offense. . . . [117 NM \u2014; 869 P2d 304. Citations omitted.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b719-5\">Turning to the evidence presented in <em>Sexson, </em>the court reiterated that the distinction accepted in other jurisdictions between murder and aiding suicide \"generally hinges upon whether the defendant actively participates in the overt act directly causing death, or whether he merely provides the means of committing suicide.\u201d 869 P2d 304-305. This distinction applies even where the decedent has given consent or requested that actual assistance be provided. In <em>Sexson,. </em>the defendant admitted holding the rifle in a position calculated to assure the decedent\u2019s death. The court concluded: \"That action transcends merely providing Victim a means to kill herself and becomes active participation in the death of another.\u201d 869 P2d 305.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-6\">In the years since 1920, when <em>Roberts </em>was decided, interpretation of causation in criminal cases has evolved in Michigan to require a closer nexus between an act and a death than was required in <em>Roberts. </em>See, e.g., <em>People v Flenon, supra; People v Scott, </em>29 Mich App 549, 558; 185 NW2d 576 (1971). The United States Supreme Court also has addressed the importance of relating culpability to criminal liability. See <em>Tison v Arizona, </em>481 US 137; 107 S Ct 1676; 95 L Ed 2d 127 (1987); <em>Mullaney v Wilbur, </em>421 US 684, 697-698; 95 S Ct 1881; 44 L Ed 2d 508 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b719-7\">In the context of participation in a suicide, the distinction recognized in <em>In re Joseph G, supra </em>at 436, constitutes the view most consistent with the overwhelming trend of modern authority. There, the California Supreme Court explained that a conviction of murder is proper if a defendant participates in the final overt act that causes death, such as firing a gun or pushing the plunger <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>on a hypodermic needle. However, where a defendant is involved merely \"in the events leading up to the commission of the final overt act, such as furnishing the means . . .,\u201d a conviction of assisted suicide is proper. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b720-4\">As noted, this Court has modified the common law when it perceives a need to tailor culpability to fit the crime more precisely than is achieved through application of existing interpretations of the common law. See, e.g., <em>Stevenson, supra; Aaron, supra. </em>For the reasons given, we perceive such a need here. Accordingly, we would overrule <em>Roberts </em>to the extent that it can be read to support the view that the common-law definition of murder encompasses the act of intentionally providing the means by which a person commits suicide.<footnotemark>69</footnotemark> Only where there is probable cause to believe that death was the direct and natural result of a defendant\u2019s act can the defendant be properly bound over on a charge of murder.<footnotemark>70</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>Where a defendant merely is involved in the events leading up to the death, such as providing the means, the proper charge is assisting in a suicide.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-4\">However, even absent a statute that specifically proscribes assisted suicide, prosecution and punishment for assisting in a suicide would not be precluded. Rather, such conduct may be prosecuted as a separate common-law offense under the saving clause of MCL 750.505; MSA 28.773:<footnotemark>71</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b721-5\">Any person who shall commit any indictable offense at the common law, for the punishment of which no provision is expressly made by any statute of this state, shall be guilty of a felony, punishable by imprisonment in the state prison not more than 5 years or by a fine of not more than $10,000.00, or both in the discretion of the court.[<footnotemark>72</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b722-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>Our reinterpretation of the common law does not enlarge the scope of criminal liability for assisted suicide, but rather reduces liability where a defendant merely is involved in the events leading up to the suicide, such as providing the means. Therefore, there is no violation of the prohibition on ex post facto laws. US Const, art I, \u00a79; Const 1963, art 1, \u00a7 10.

Such balance should be struck with due respect to history and rationally evolving tradition. Thus, in the present context, the process of rational evolution <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>must focus on a determination whether the question of assisted suicide can be left to the political process without intrusion on a protected liberty interest, eschewing either a radical departure from tradition or the moral code of individual judges.

A person who participates in the death of another may be charged with murder, irrespective of the consent of the deceased. Nor do I agree with the lead opinion\u2019s conclusion or rationale justifying a charge of assisted suicide under the saving clause.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The saving clause recognizes only unprovided-for common-law crimes; it does not authorize this Court to create new crimes. If assisting a suicide is a common-law crime and not murder under the common-law definition incorporated in our murder statutes, it may be penalized as another crime under the saving clause. The Court, however, cannot simply exclude from the common-law definition of murder that which is murder under our statutes and then hold that the Legislature intended in the saving clause to authorize the Court to say that that which was murder at the common law is now a new crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-7\">Finally, I disagree with the conclusion that one who provides the means for suicides and participates in the acts leading up to death may not be charged with murder as long as the final act is that of the decedent. In stating this conclusion, the lead opinion has parsed the definition of participation to permit involvement that is dangerously <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>overinclusive. Absent standards established to distinguish between those who are in fact terminally ill or suffering in agony and rationally wish to die and those who are not, there is no principled vehicle in the judicial arsenal to protect against abuse, save the jury\u2019s evaluation of a given defendant\u2019s conduct. The acts shown in the Oakland County case establish causation as a matter of law for purposes of bindover. Thus, the trial court erred in quashing the information, and the decision of the Court of Appeals should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-5\">i</p>\n<p id=\"b725-6\">Criminal homicide has been a statutory offense in Michigan since 1846. The crime is not defined by reference to its elements but by reference to the common law. <em>People v Schmitt, </em>275 Mich 575, 577; 267 NW 741 (1936). There is no dispute that at the time these offenses were committed, the Legislature had shown no disposition to depart from the common-law definition of murder as including assisted suicide. The lead opinion today would alter the definition of murder by changing the causation requirement in the context of suicide to exclude from liability for criminal homicide those who intentionally participate in the events that directly cause death with the intention that death occur.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-7\">However, the intended results of the plaintiff\u2019s acts were the results actually obtained, and the acts were both the cause in fact and the proximate or foreseeable cause of the decedents\u2019 deaths. The lead opinion would thus redefine murder as it is defined in our statutes and has created a special causation standard, unknown in any other jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-8\">The detailed account of the preliminary exami<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>nation testimony describing the assisted suicides of Ms. Miller and Ms. Wantz, <em>ante </em>at 482-484, belies the notion that the degree of participation by the defendant in these events was insufficient to permit a charge of murder even in those states that have adopted separate penalties for soliciting or assisting suicide. Testimony at the preliminary examination presented evidence that the defendant, inter alia, inserted iv needles into Ms. Wantz\u2019 arm, tied strings to her fingers so she could release chemicals into her bloodstream, and placed a mask over Ms. Miller\u2019s face so that she could breathe carbon monoxide gas. <em>Id. </em>at 483-484. The mask was secured so tightly that without intervention that fact alone would have caused death. It cannot be said, as a matter of law, that these actions did not establish probable cause to believe that the defendant committed murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-6\">The decedents\u2019 alleged desire in the present case that they die with the defendant\u2019s assistance does not absolve the defendant of criminal liability. <em>People v Potter, </em>5 Mich 1, 5 (1858). The request by the decedents does not provide justification or excuse. E.g., <em>State v Cobb, </em>229 Kan 522; 625 P2d 1133 (1981); <em>State v Fuller, </em>203 Neb 233; 278 NW2d 756 (1979); anno: <em>Criminal liability for death of another as result of accused\u2019s attempt to kill self or assist another\u2019s suicide, </em>40 ALR4th 702, \u00a7 5, pp 709-710. The magistrate\u2019s decision to bind over the defendant for trial should be upheld.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-7\">ii</p>\n<p id=\"b726-8\">The lead opinion invites the circuit court on remand to draw a distinction between acts of participation that are merely \"the events leading up to\u201d the deaths of the decedents and \"the final overt act that causes death\u201d that, as a matter of law, will constitute probable cause for the charge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>of murder. Such a \"test\u201d transfers the responsibility for the outcome from the shoulders of this Court to the trial court and effectively converts every criminal homicide accomplished by participation into assisting suicide.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-4\">It could be argued that this solution does no more than what the assisted suicide law does. But the assisted suicide law is still only a temporary measure, and the Legislature has never indicated that it would not follow the model of other states and continue to apply the law of criminal homicide despite the existence of statutes specifically directed to suicide.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-5\">The lead opinion\u2019s \"solution\u201d is in fact an invitation to continue participation until the level of participation assumes a level of proof for bindover suggesting that the defendant intended to kill a decedent for impure reasons. In pragmatic terms, the force of the law is to discourage conduct on the margins. What the lead opinion would do in setting new margins is permit a new range of activity and thus increase the potential for abuse of the vulnerable by the active participant.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-6\">As the Canadian Supreme Court recently and aptly observed in upholding a blanket prohibition against assisted suicide:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b727-7\">The basis for this refusal is twofold it seems\u2014 first, the active participation by one individual in the death of another is intrinsically morally and legally wrong, and secondly, there is no certainty that abuses can be prevented by anything less than a complete prohibition. <em>[Rodriguez v British Columbia, </em>107 DLR4th 342, 401 (1993).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b727-8\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b727-9\"><em>People v Roberts, </em>211 Mich 187; 178 NW 690 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>(1920), correctly held that the homicide statute had incorporated the common-law definition of assisted suicide as murder. The question presented is whether we have the authority to modify that definition and, granting that we have the power to do so, whether we should. <em>People v Couch, </em>436 Mich 414; 461 NW2d 683 (1990). The latter question involves the issue whether the judiciary can devise an acceptable formula advancing the autonomy of those who deem their lives not worthy to be lived, without jeopardizing the lives of those whose further existence society might deem not worthy of protection. That the Court is unable to do so is illustrated by today\u2019s decision that alters the law of causation in all suicide settings, not just those of the terminally ill or acutely suffering.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-4\">As Justice Jackson observed in a famous dissent, a judicial decision has a force all its own. \"The principle then lies about like a loaded weapon .... Every repetition imbeds that principle more deeply in our law and thinking and expands it to new purposes.\u201d <em>Korematsu v United States, </em>323 US 214, 246; 65 S Ct 193; 89 L Ed 194 (1944).</p>\n<p id=\"b728-5\">The fact that an active participant in the death of another risks jury determination that the circumstances are not so compelling as to benefit from their mercy-dispensing power tests the situation and the actions by the only repository of authority within the judicial reach. Whether death has been caused for good, bad, or mixed reasons, or whether the person is in fact presently incurable or suffering intolerable and unmanageable pain, and has a fixed and rational desire to die, are issues that should be addressed by a jury or the Legislature, not by this Court as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-6\">Today the Court purports to approve only a mild deviation from the common law by moving the line of protection the murder statute affords from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>participation to pulling the trigger. But the law that condemns such killings as murder has a substantially greater deterrent effect, imposing a substantially greater responsibility on those who would violate it than the penalty for assisted suicide.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-4\">While the Court\u2019s redefinition of causation is presumably correctable, the lead opinion would reduce the deterrent potential without any assurance that the line it draws will not marginally increase the risk of death for those who would have a reason to live had society and the participant in their demise valued their continued existence.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-5\">The lead opinion recognizes that the state\u2019s interest in guarding against potential abuses does not require it to stand neutral. The state\u2019s interest in protecting the lives of those who wish to live under any circumstances also justifies the most severe sanction for those who would cause such deaths. The lead opinion nonetheless sends the message that it assesses the quality of particular human life and judges as a matter of law that it is less culpable to destroy some lives than others.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In a society that draws a line that dictates that it is better that many go free than that one innocent person should be convicted, something approaching the principles protecting against error that are extended to the criminally accused should be extended to the victims of those who are willing to participate in suicide and to cause death, as long as they do not pull the final trigger. Kamisar, <em>Some non-religious views against proposed \"mercy-</em>killing\u201d <em>legislation, </em>42 Minn L R 969, 1041 (1958).</p>\n<p id=\"b730-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>The lead opinion\u2019s distrust of the jury and its dislike for the severity of the punishment imposed by the law of criminal homicide has caused it to draw a line that crosses a dangerous threshold. The risk of irreversible mistake, however \"minimal,\u201d should not be borne by those no longer able to protest\u2014it should rest on those who assume the authority and wisdom to extinguish human life.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-4\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b730-5\">To the extent that this Court reduces culpability for those who actively participate in acts that produce death, we do so at the risk of the most vulnerable members of our society\u2014the elderly, the ill, the chronically depressed, those suffering from a panoply of stressful situations: adolescence, loss of employment, the death of a child or spouse, divorce, alcoholism, the abuse of other mind-altering substances, and the burden of social stigmatization.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-6\">The lead opinion\u2019s solution assumes the actor is a sufficient buffer between the patient and the family, that the actor knows enough about the disease to assure its terminal course and enough about the sanity of the deceased to evaluate the rationality of suicide. The lead opinion thus ignores the distinction between a voluntary act carried out if the victim is sane, and the inquiry into whether the victim\u2019s mental state is compromised by disease, depression, or medication.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-7\">c</p>\n<p id=\"b730-8\">The Model Penal Code recognizes the inherent difficulty of objective management of an assisted suicide law to separate proper from improper motivations of a participant. The code classifies pur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>posely causing, that is, engaging in conduct \"but for which the result in question would not have occurred,\u201d Model Penal Code, \u00a7 210.5, comment 4, p 98, suicide by force, duress, or deception as criminal homicide. Aiding or assisting another to commit suicide is a felony at the level of manslaughter if the defendant\u2019s conduct causes, that is, was a \"significantly contributing factor\u201d to a suicide or attempted suicide. <em>Id., </em>comment 5, p 103. The same distinctions are drawn in statutory schemes. States that have enacted assisted suicide statutes continue to permit prosecutions for criminal homicides out of recognition that underinclusive line drawing by the judiciary may, as here, permit dangerously overinclusive activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-4\">In fact, as the excerpts from the cases cited by the lead opinion indicate, it has not aligned itself with other states. Thus, in <em>People v Cleaves, </em>229 Cal App 3d 367, 375; 280 Cal Rptr 146 (1991), the court found that a defendant who held the decedent\u2019s back so the decedent could strangle himself was not merely a passive participant in a suicide, stating that the murder statute applies \"where a person actively assists in performing the Overt act resulting in death . . . .\u201d Likewise, <em>State v Sexson, </em>117 NM 113; 869 P2d 301 (NM App, 1994), does not support the lead opinion\u2019s revisionist view of causation. In <em>Sexson, </em>the court found that defendant could be charged with murder on evidence that he merely held a gun in place because \"[t]hat action transcends merely providing the Victim a means to kill herself and becomes active participation in the death of another.\u201d <em>Id., </em>869 P2d 305.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-5\">The factual setting and issue decided in <em>In re Joseph G, </em>34 Cal 3d 429; 194 Cal Rptr 163; 667 P2d 1176; 40 ALR4th 690 (1983), are markedly dissimilar from those in the present case. Unlike defendant Kevorkian, who was not a party to any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>similar agreement, but rather an aider in accomplishing the deaths of two other persons, the defendant in <em>Joseph G </em>was a participant in a mutual suicide pact, intending at the time of his actions to kill both himself and his partner.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b732-5\">In finding that a defendant who simultaneously undertook completion of the agreed to suicides with his deceased partner by a single instrumentality could only be found guilty of assisting suicide, and not murder, the California court \"decline[d] to ritualistically apply the active/passive distinction\u201d between murder and suicide assistance employed by earlier precedent to the <em>unique </em>facts before it. <em>Id. </em>at 440.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-6\">The <em>Joseph G </em>court did analyze precedent regarding the distinction between murder and the statutory crime of assisting suicide, but did not hold, as the lead opinion suggests, that a charge of murder against a suicide assistor is unavailable unless the assistor participated in the final overt act. Instead, the court concluded that \"the key to distinguishing between the crimes of murder and of assisting suicide is the active or passive role of the defendant in the suicide. If the defendant merely furnishes the means, he is guilty of aiding a suicide; if he actively participates in the death of the suicide victim,, he is guilty of murder.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 436. The court made no clear distinction between where such passive assistance ends and active participation begins.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>_</p>\n<p id=\"b733-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>Although these distinctions are irrelevant in this context because we did not have an assisted suicide statute at the time of the deaths of Ms. Wantz and Ms. Miller, the referenced discussion establishes that, in these states, participation in the overt acts causing death is chargeable as murder. Thus, the cases cited do not support the lead opinion\u2019s conclusion that if the defendant did not participate \"in <em>the </em>act that . . . directly cause[s] death,\u201d <em>ante </em>at 494, n 69 (emphasis added), he cannot be bound over on a charge of murder.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Sexson did not pull the trigger, he held up the gun, and Cleaves did not strangle the decedent, he assisted the decedent in completing the act. Likewise, defendant Kevorkian did not pull the trigger for Ms. Miller, but he assisted Ms. Miller in completing the act. In Ms. Wantz\u2019 case, his involvement was even more direct. Defendant inserted the needle and Ms. Wantz sedated herself. When her hand dropped involuntarily, the trigger was pulled and the needle inserted by defendant was .activated carrying potassium chloride in sufficient quantities to cause death._</p>\n<p id=\"b734-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b734-4\">Finally, the lead opinion finds that one who has only participated in a suicide but has not done the final act causing death may be prosecuted under the saving clause. MCL 750.505; MSA 28.773. The statute is applicable only when two conditions obtain: the conduct is not otherwise punishable by statute and the conduct was indictable at common law. However, at common law, one who does the deed, even through an innocent agent, is a principle in the first degree. Perkins &amp; Boyce, Criminal Law (3d ed), p 737. If suicide is not criminal,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> the lead opinion has attempted by judicial fiat to create a new crime of assisting suicide. Culpability for persons assisting in suicide at common law was based on participation as parties to the crime of suicide.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The saving clause furnishes no basis for the Court\u2019s creation of a new crime. The usurpation of legislative authority in the lead opinion\u2019s approach is evident if one considers the reach of its rationale. The lead opinion suggests an ability to exclude certain factual settings from the reach.# of the homicide statutes and then, as it were, find legislative authorization of a free-standing authority to recognize newly evolving crimes punishable under the saving clause. If such conduct were permissible, the Court could simply reorder the punishment for any felony by concluding that conduct falls outside a given statute but within the saving clause. Contrary to the lead opinion\u2019s conclusion, the saving clause is not a delegation of legislative authority to this Court to create new crimes. The Legislature intended to save only what had not otherwise been covered in 1846.</p>\n<p id=\"ABl\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b735-5\">The lead opinion would hold that where one \"only\u201d plans and participates in a death the actor can claim was \"suicide,\u201d he may not be charged as a matter of law with criminal homicide. No jurisdiction in the history of this country has so held and for obvious reasons. We have no way of assuring that redefining the line that constitutes causation will distinguish between terminally ill or desperately suffering people and those who think they are, no way of deciding in advance that the act of suicide is that of a rational person who chose death with dignity or that of a severely depressed person who- would not have chosen death had help been available. Most significantly, the lead opinion\u2019s unwillingness to allow a jury to dispense mercy by determining the degree of culpability for a result clearly intended and caused in fact by a defendant is a sea change in the fundamental value we have assigned to the preservation of human life as one of the last great faiths that unites us.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-6\">The question whether the definition of murder should be changed so as to exclude one who participates in all events leading up to the death, save for the final act, is a matter of compelling public interest, demanding a balancing of legitimate interests that this Court is institutionally unsuited to perform. Although the Legislature passed a temporary assisted suicide law that included participation, it has not indicated that it intends to redefine murder, and every jurisdiction that has adopted a specific law covering assisted suicide has permitted prosecution for murder where the participation goes \"too far.\u201d No issue is more deserving of continued legislative debate and public study regarding whether, when, and how persons <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>can maximize personal autonomy without running the risk of creating a societal quicksand for irreversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-4\">The decision to stay our hand in this matter is not simply a matter of adhering to the rule of law.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> It reflects the wisdom in recognizing that if we choose not to intervene, we have left the pressure for change in this rapidly developing and exceedingly complex field in the forum where it is best addressed. To choose to intervene is to remove the pressure to decide that assisting suicide can be found by a jury to be murder, and to add the Court\u2019s imprimatur to the voices of those who argue for an expansive right to self-determination that would decriminalize assisted suicide.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-5\">As Professor Tribe observed in the context of constitutional principles regarding these issues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b736-6\">[T]he judiciary\u2019s silence regarding such constitutional principles probably reflects a concern that, once recognized, rights to die might be uncontainable and might prove susceptible to grave abuse, more than it suggests that courts cannot be persuaded that self-determination and personhood may include a right to dictate the circumstances under which life is to be ended. In any event, whatever the reason for the absence in the courts of expansive notions about self-determination, the resulting deference to legislatures may prove wise in light of the complex character of the rights at stake and the significant potential that, without careful statutory guidelines and gradually evolved procedural controls, legalizing euthanasia, rather than respecting people, may endanger personhood.

They should be allowed to commence an action at any time to establish a record so that if and when they approach the threshold where it is appropriate to conclude that they are entitled to medical assistance to commit suicide, the preliminary phases of such litigation will have been concluded and the circuit court can, on a proper showing, expeditiously enter an order providing the relief that they seek so that they can die, if they choose, less convulsively, less painfully, and with as much dignity as may be possible.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-6\">iv</p>\n<p id=\"b742-7\">I turn to the meritorious question, whether \u00a7 7 of act 3 violates the Due Process Clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-8\">The lead opinion states that \"the threshold question in this case is whether the [Due Process CJlause encompasses a fundamental right to commit suicide and, if so, whether it includes a right to assistance.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark>_</p>\n<p id=\"b743-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>By framing the question in this manner, the lead opinion foreordains the answer.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-5\">There is a long history of laws prohibiting suicide.

Those laws assume that persons seeking to terminate their lives are emotionally disturbed or mentally ill. This is so in the vast majority of cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-6\">The real issue is not whether the state can generally prohibit suicide. The real issue is whether the state may deny a competent, terminally ill person, facing imminent, agonizing death, medical assistance to commit suicide.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-7\">I agree with the lead opinion that assisted suicide can be distinguished from other conduct protected by the Due Process Clause, such as abortion and the withdrawal of life-sustaining medical treatment. The absence of controlling precedent precisely addressing the issue does not, however, end the inquiry, as the lead opinion presupposes when it states, \"[w]e disagree . . . that either <em>Cruzan </em>[v <em>Director, Missouri Dep\u2019t of Health, </em>497 US 261; 110 S Ct 2841; 111 L Ed 2d 224 (1990)] or <em>[Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania </em>v] <em>Casey </em>[, 505 US 833; 112 S Ct 2791; 120 L Ed 2d 674 (1992),] <em>preordains </em>that the Supreme Court would find that any persons, including the terminally ill, have a liberty interest in suicide that is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>protected by the Fourteenth Amendment.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b744-4\">If the issue were preordained, these cases would not be so troubling. The real issue facing the Court is not whether suicide or assisting suicide can be proscribed by law, but whether the Due Process Clause bars a state from depriving a competent, terminally ill person, facing imminent death, and increasing agony, from obtaining medical assistance to avoid suffering such a bitter end of life.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-5\">The lead opinion distinguishes at length the instant cases from <em>Cruzan </em>and <em>Casey, </em>and stresses the obvious: there is a long history of laws outlawing suicide.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-6\">Abortion and withdrawal of life-sustaining measures are indeed different from assisted suicide. Nevertheless, a reasoned application of the principles stated in <em>Casey </em>and <em>Cruzan </em>persuades me that state law restrictions on a person\u2019s ability to end his life implicates the interest in personal liberty. Whether a competent, terminally ill person has a right to medical assistance to commit suicide cannot be decided without balancing the state\u2019s interest against the person\u2019s interest. I conclude that the United States Supreme Court, as presently composed, if constrained to decide the question, would hold that the person\u2019s interest outweighs the state\u2019s interest when the person is competent, terminally ill and facing an imminent and agonizing death.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-7\">I thus so conclude, not from any explicit command of precedent, but by applying the approach suggested by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Casey, </em>\"reasoned judgment\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> to the imperfect analogies of <em>Casey </em>and Cruzan.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark>_</p>\n<p id=\"b745-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>V</p>\n<p id=\"b745-4\">The lead opinion dismisses <em>Casey, </em>arguing that it was decided on the basis of stare decisis, rather than the merits, and that abortion is sui generis. <em>Casey, </em>however, reaffirmed the doctrinal support for earlier abortion rights decisions of the United States Supreme Court, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-5\">[T]he reservations any of us may have in reaffirming the central holding of <em>Roe </em>[v <em>Wade, </em>410 US 113; 93 S Ct 705; 35 L Ed 2d 147 (1973)] are <em>outweighed by the explication of individual liberty </em>we have given combined with the force of <em>stare decisis.\u201d [Id., </em>112 S Ct 2808. Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b745-6\">The <em>Casey </em>plurality clarified the analytic method for deciding substantive due process issues, and said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-7\">The inescapable fact is that adjudication of substantive due process claims may call upon the Court in interpreting the Constitution to exercise that same capacity which by tradition courts always have exercised: <em>reasoned judgment. Its boundaries are not susceptible of expression as a simple rule. </em>That does not mean we are free to invalidate state policy choices with which we disagree; yet neither does it permit us to shrink from the duties of our office. <em>[Id., </em>112 S Ct 2806 (opinion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>of O\u2019Connor, Kennedy, and Souter, JJ.). Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b746-4\">Although the lead opinion would limit the inquiry solely to historical practices and precedent, <em>Casey </em>calls on us to engage in a more thoughtful, less formulaic approach.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b746-5\">VI</p>\n<p id=\"b746-6\">Another line of cases, beginning with <em>In re Quinlan, </em>70 NJ 10; 355 A2d 647 (1976), and, more recently <em>Cruzan, supra, </em>addresses the question whether life-sustaining medical treatment may be withdrawn from an incompetent person. <em>Cruzan </em>said that recognition of a right to refuse life-sustaining support was implicit in the Court\u2019s earlier decisions construing the Due Process Clause. The Court on that basis assumed that \"the United States Constitution would grant a <em>competent </em>person a constitutionally protected right to refuse lifesaving hydration and nutrition.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 279.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> The Court said that competing interests were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>involved, especially where, as in <em>Cruzan,</em><footnotemark><em>19</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the life of an incompetent person was involved.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> The Court ruled in conclusion that a Missouri statute requiring that there be clear and convincing evidence of the incompetent person\u2019s intent before authorizing the withdrawal of life-sustaining treatment struck a constitutionally permissible balance between the competing interests.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b747-4\">The lead opinion contends that withdrawal of life support can be distinguished from assisted suicide. I generally agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-5\">A rule allowing a person to have his respirator disconnected, but to take no other steps to end his life, condemns him to choke to death on his own sputum. Similarly, if the law bars a person who can only take nourishment through a feeding tube from taking steps in addition to ordering the tube removed to end his life, he is required to suffer death by starvation and dehydration. Barring such persons from taking other steps to end their lives would, I think, constitute an undue burden on the right implicitly recognized in <em>Cruzan.</em><footnotemark><em>22</em></footnotemark><em> Cruzan </em>should not be read as limiting a person to a half step when that would result in greater suffering.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-6\">The legitimate concerns about involuntary euthanasia apply with at least as much force to the withdrawal of life support where the person is incompetent, yet the United States Supreme Court in <em>Cruzan </em>held that a state statute permitting the withdrawal of life support on proof of the incompetent\u2019s wishes by clear and convincing evidence was consistent with due process._</p>\n<p id=\"A17I\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>VII</p>\n<p id=\"b748-5\">The <em>Casey </em>plurality resolved the conflict between the state\u2019s interest in the life of the fetus and the woman\u2019s interest in bodily integrity and self-determination by drawing a line at fetal viability.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Before viability, the state may not place an \"undue burden\u201d on the woman\u2019s right to an abortion.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b748-6\">In <em>Cruzan, </em>the Court struck a balance between the state\u2019s interest in life and preventing euthanasia, and the incompetent person\u2019s interest in being free of unwelcome bodily intrusions. The Court found that a \"clear and convincing\u201d evidentiary standard provided a permissible balance of the competing interests.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b748-7\">In the suicide context, legitimate state interests generally outweigh a person\u2019s interest in ending his life. The vast majority of suicides are \"irrational\u201d efforts by the depressed or mentally disturbed. Society can reasonably assume that a person\u2019s mental problems have clouded his perception. Where an otherwise healthy person is depressed or mentally disturbed, the personal liberty interest is weak, and the state has a strong interest in protecting the person\u2019s interests in life.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-8\">In contrast, where the person involved is competent, terminally ill, and facing imminent, agonizing death, the interest of the state in preserving life is weak, and the interest of the terminally ill person in ending suffering is strong._</p>\n<p id=\"b749-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>The state asserts two interests.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> First, the state\u2019s general interest in preserving life.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> In most situations where a person might seek to commit suicide, the person, even if handicapped or emotionally disturbed, has years of life remaining for the state to protect. That possibility has been largely foreclosed for a terminally ill person. The choice that remains is not between life and death, but over the terms of death.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-4\">The principal argument against assisted suicide is the second interest asserted by the state: assuring that persons who desire to live are not coerced into committing suicide. While this is clearly a concern of great importance, adequate procedures can and have been developed to assure that a terminally ill person\u2019s choice to end life is not coerced.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b749-5\">Restrictions on medical assistance to commit suicide for the terminally ill should be evaluated according to the undue burden standard enunciated in <em>Casey.</em><footnotemark><em>29</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The undue burden standard permits the state to regulate the process of medically assisted suicide to assure that the person truly (a) is terminally ill, (b) is competent, (c) is suffering agonizing pain, (d) faces imminent death, (e) de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>sires to commit suicide, and (f) needs or desires help to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-4\">The lead opinion contends that \"[n]o clear definition of 'terminal illness\u2019 is medically or legally possible, since only in hindsight is it known with certainty when someone is going to die.\u201d<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> There is, to be sure, difficulty in defining \"terminal illness.\u201d That does not justify avoiding the issue.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b750-5\">With appropriate regulation and safeguards, the state may account for the differences in medical opinion in determining whether a competent, terminally ill person faces an imminent agonizing death.</p>\n<judges id=\"b750-6\">Mallett, J., concurred with Levin, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b737-7\"> MCL 752.1021 <em>et seq.; </em>MSA 28.547(121) <em>et seq.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b737-8\"> (1) A person who has knowledge that another person intends to commit or attempt to commit suicide and who intentionally does either of the following is guilty of criminal assistance to suicide, a felony punishable by imprisonment for not more than 4 years or by a fine of not more than $2,000.00, or both:</p>\n<p id=\"b737-9\">(a) Provides the physical means by which the other person attempts or commits suicide.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-10\">(b) Participates in a physical act by which the other person attempts or commits suicide.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-11\">(2) Subsection (1) shall not apply to withholding or withdrawing medical treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-12\">(3) Subsection (1) does not apply to prescribing, dispensing, or administering medications or procedures if the intent is to relieve pain or discomfort and not to cause death, even if the medication or procedure may hasten or increase the risk of death.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-13\">(4) This section shall take effect February 25, 1993.</p>\n<p id=\"ASs\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>(5) This section is repealed effective 6 months after the date the commission makes its recommendations to the legislature pursuant to section 4.

They argue that because there is a common background making suicide and assisted suicide crimes, physician-assisted suicide cannot be a fundamental right. They also argue that such a right cannot be found anywhere in the constitution or its amendments. However, to recognize only fundamental rights according to such a test is unsuitable for the vast and fast-moving progressions of the modern world. Earlier laws or traditions are not the \"source\u201d of liberty or privacy interests.

Moreover, if the historical analysis test is appropriate, then the holding in <em>Roe v Wade, </em>410 US 113; 93 S Ct 705; 35 L Ed 2d 147 (1973), would be nothing more than an exception to the rule.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b756-6\">A. THE RIGHT TO DIE</p>\n<p id=\"b756-7\">This Court should not demand that plaintiffs establish an historical right to self determine the quality of life that a terminally ill person must endure.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-8\">The lead opinion suggests that because the <em>Cruzan </em>Court merely \"assumed\u201d for the purposes of that case that a person has a constitutional right to refuse life-sustaining treatment such a right may not exist. Yet if this Court was squarely presented with that issue, it is doubtful that it would rule contrary to established precedent of this state and others.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b756-9\">Even applying the \"concept of ordered liberty\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>analysis espoused by the lead opinion, the right to refuse life-sustaining treatment can be recognized. In <em>Washington v Harper, </em>494 US 210; 110 S Ct 1028; 108 L Ed 2d 178 (1990), the United States Supreme Court found that a competent person, even an inmate who suffers from psychotic episodes, has a due process liberty interest to be free from the unwanted administration of antipsychotic medications.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Further, in the seminal case, <em>In re Quinlan, supra </em>at 39, the New Jersey Supreme Court explicitly recognized such a right:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b757-4\">We have no doubt, in these unhappy circumstances, that if Karen were herself miraculously lucid for an interval (not altering the existing prognosis of the condition to which she would soon return) and perceptive of her irreversible condition, she could effectively decide upon discontinuance of the life-support apparatus, even if it meant the prospect of natural death.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b757-5\">We have no hesitancy in deciding . . . that no external compelling interest of the State could compel Karen to endure the unendurable, only to vegetate a few measurable months with no realistic possibility of returning to any semblance of cognitive or sapient life.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b757-6\">Both <em>Harper </em>and <em>Quinlan, </em>establish that a competent person has a fundamental right to refuse unwanted medical treatment. But more importantly, <em>Quinlan </em>and its progeny establish that a person has a right to determine whether to continue suffering when faced with an inevitable death and that the state may not compel unwanted lifesaving treatment._</p>\n<p id=\"b758-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>Moreover, other jurisdictions have recognized that the state\u2019s interest in preserving life includes the duty to protect the right of a person not to die in a demeaning or degrading manner.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> To recognize the right asserted here is simply a logical extension of the law.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> As Justice O\u2019Connor stated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>in <em>Cruzan, supra </em>at 289: \"Requiring a competent adult to endure such procedures against her will burdens the patient\u2019s liberty, dignity, and freedom to determine the course of her own treatment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b759-5\">B. <em>PLANNED PARENTHOOD v CASEY</em></p>\n<p id=\"b759-6\">In <em>Planned Parenthood v Casey, </em>the United States Supreme Court reviewed the constitutionality of the Pennsylvania Abortion Control Act and whether its provisions constituted an undue burden on a woman\u2019s right to receive an abortion. For our purposes, the most instructive aspect of <em>Casey </em>was its reaffirmance of the basic tenets of <em>Roe v Wade </em>and a woman\u2019s fundamental right to receive an abortion.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b759-7\">The opinion in <em>Casey </em>recognized that not all the substantive due process rights were identifiable at the time of the drafting of either the Bill of Rights or the Fourteenth Amendment. The. framers of the constitution were also aware of this fact and understood that liberty could not be summarized in a single document, no matter how extensive. Justice <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>Harlan\u2019s assertion in <em>Poe v Ullman </em>illustrates this principle best:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b760-4\">\"[T]he full scope of the liberty guaranteed by the Due Process Clause cannot be found in or limited by the precise terms of the specific guarantees elsewhere provided in the Constitution. <em>This 'liberty\u2019 is not a series of isolated points </em>pricked out in terms of the taking of property; the freedom of speech, press, and religion; the right to keep and bear arms; the freedom from unreasonable searches and seizures; and so on. <em>It is a rational continuum which, broadly speaking, includes a freedom from all substantial arbitrary impositions and purposeless restraints, . </em>. . and which \u00e1lso recognizes, what a reasonable and sensitive judgment must, that certain interests require particularly careful scrutiny of the state needs asserted to justify their abridgments.\u201d <em>[Casey, </em>112 S Ct 2805, quoting <em>Poe v Ullman, </em>367 US 497, 543; 81 S Ct 1752; 6 L Ed 2d 989 (1961) (Harlan, J., dissenting). Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b760-5\">Thus, determining the existence of a liberty right involves a textual examination of the constitution, an inward examination of a jurist\u2019s beliefs, and an analysis of public inclinations.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-6\">Justice O\u2019Connor maintained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b760-7\">The inescapable fact is that adjudication of substantive due process claims may call upon the Court in interpreting the Constitution to exercise that same capacity which by tradition courts always have exercised: reasoned judgment. Its boundaries are not susceptible of expression as a simple rule. . . . <em>\"Due process has not been reduced to any formula </em>. . . .\u201d <em>[Casey, </em>112 S Ct 2806. Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b760-8\">Even without a formulaic approach, reasoned <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>judgment coupled with guidance from the following language of <em>Casey </em>provides some insight regarding the existence of the right asserted here:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b761-4\">Our law affords constitutional protection to personal decisions relating to marriage, procreation, contraception, family relationships, child rearing, and education. . . . These matters, involving the most intimate and personal choices a person may make in a lifetime, choices central to personal dignity and autonomy, are central to the liberty protected by the Fourteenth Amendment. <em>At the heart of liberty is the right to define one\u2019s own concept of existence, </em>of meaning, of the universe, and of the mystery of human life. <em>[Id., </em>112 S Ct 2807. Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b761-5\">In the ordinary course of existence, some decisions remain so personal in nature that society is not in a position to make judgments about their appropriateness. It is difficult to imagine a more personal or intimate choice than determining the nature or extent of one\u2019s suffering during a terminal illness. A person\u2019s conscience, coupled with the advice of an informed and personally chosen physician, is the appropriate decision-making method.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-6\">Therefore, under the <em>Casey </em>\"undue burden\u201d analysis, I believe that the statute is facially invalid because it prohibits <em>all </em>physician-assisted suicide. As established in the right to die cases, a person has the right to determine the extent of his suffering when faced with an inevitable death. A complete ban on physician-assisted suicide represents an \"undue burden\u201d on the right of the terminally ill to end their suffering through physician-prescribed medications. As in <em>Casey, </em>an infringement of a fundamental right by the state <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>that completely bars the exercise of that right cannot pass constitutional muster.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b762-4\">Dr. Kevorkian asks this Court to find that there is a constitutional right for a suffering person to commit suicide with the assistance of a physician. However, I do not believe that people can always make competent decisions regarding their fate while suffering because too often there are circumstances in which such decisions would be later regarded as mistakes.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-5\">Plaintiffs ask this Court to recognize that a terminally ill person has a fundamental right to hasten an inevitable death. To the extent that the plaintiff asks this Court to recognize that a terminally ill person has an absolute right to make a choice to hasten an inevitable death, I believe this swings the pendulum too far. Instead, I would conclude that a terminally ill person has such a right only if the person has made a competent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>decision and is suffering from great pain.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Because plaintiffs are in a position to meet such a requirement, the Court ought not allow the prospect of reversal by the United States Supreme Court to inhibit the analysis of the very real constitutional claims presented by the plaintiffs. Beyond this criteria, I would hold that the state may assert its interest to preserve life as well as other established interests. Therefore, because the statute completely prohibits physician-assisted suicide, I believe that it is facially invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-5\">This, of course, is not to say that the state does not have a readily identifiable interest in this area. The state has a legitimate interest in the preservation of the lives of its citizenry. However, the interests are not all-encompassing interests that would allow a blanket ban on physician-assisted suicide. \"The Constitution imposes on this Court the obligation to 'examine carefully . . . the extent to which [the legitimate government interests advanced] are served by the challenged regulation.\u2019 \u201d <em>Cruzan </em>at 303 (Brennan, J., dissenting, quoting <em>Moore v East Cleveland, supra </em>at 499). The interest in the preservation of life that is advanced by the state in the present case is not served by preserving the life of a person who will inevitably die and is suffering intolerable pain.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-6\">II. THE STATE\u2019S INTEREST</p>\n<p id=\"b763-7\">While it is arguable that each of us possesses the right to commit suicide because suicide is no longer criminally punishable, such a right, if it exists, is not absolute when a third party is involved. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>Indeed, protecting the rights and interests of third parties underpins both our constitutional doctrine and criminal laws. Accordingly, I do not embrace the suggestion that because a person may have the right to commit suicide, he also has an unconditional constitutional right to physician-assisted suicide. Rather, the right to physician-assisted suicide must be balanced against the countervailing interests of the state and society.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-5\">There are four main interests in this area that may be asserted by the state: (1) the preservation of life, (2) the protection of innocent third parties, (3) the prevention of suicide, and (4) the maintenance of the ethical integrity of the medical profession. <em>In re Rosebush, </em>195 Mich App 675, 681; 491 NW2d 633 (1992); <em>In re Conroy, </em>98 NJ 321; 486 A2d 1209 (1985); <em>Donaldson v Lundgren, </em>2 Cal App 4th 1614, 1620; 4 Cal Rptr 2d 59 (1992); <em>Cruzan </em>at 269-271. See also anno: <em>Judicial power to order discontinuance of life-sustaining treatment, </em>48 ALR4th 67. These authorities have uniformly maintained that a \" 'state\u2019s interest in the preservation of life has been held to be insufficient to outweigh the individual right where the life which would be preserved would be one in a merely vegetative state or one enduring only a prolonged process of dying ....\u2019\u201d <em>Rosebush </em>at 681, n 2. Similarly, there does not exist a sufficiently compelling justification for the infringement of the right of a competent, terminally ill person suffering from great pain to hasten death through physician-prescribed medications.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-6\">As a person\u2019s illness progresses to the point of facing an inevitable death while suffering great pain, the state cannot put forth a sufficient rationale to completely proscribe physician-assisted suicide. In <em>Brophy v New England Sinai Hosp, </em>398 Mass 417, 433; 497 NE2d 626 (1986), the Massa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>chusetts Supreme Judicial Court balanced the state\u2019s interest in the preservation of human life against the right of self-determination and individual autonomy. The court noted that the state\u2019s interest ordinarily involves the prolongation of human life and that that interest is \"very high when 'human life [can] be saved where the affliction is curable.\u2019 \u201d Quoting <em>Superintendent of Belchertown State School v Saikewicz, </em>373 Mass 728, 742; 370 NE2d 417 (1977). However, the court further noted that this interest diminishes as the prognosis for recovery wanes. <em>Brophy, </em>398 Mass 433. Thus, when a person is suffering from a terminal disease, the state should avoid subjective judgments concerning the quality of that person\u2019s life.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b765-5\">The state may also require that such decisions be made competently.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Such a requirement has been fashioned by previous courts as well. In <em>Application of President &amp; Directors of Georgetown College, Inc, </em>118 US App DC 80; 331 F2d 1000 (1964), ithe court denied the right of patients to refuse lifesaving treatment for themselves in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>circumstances strongly suggesting that they lack the time or the capacity for reflection on the matter, so that the course least likely to do irreversible harm was an insistence on proceeding with treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-5\">Patients have been denied the right to refuse life-sustaining medical treatment where they did not have the capacity or an adequate opportunity to reflect on the finality of the decision. See, e.g., <em>Osgood v Dist of Columbia, </em>567 F Supp 1026 (D DC, 1983). Additionally, the <em>Quinlan </em>court suggested that a person in extreme shock or pain is incapable of making a truly informed decision. 70 NJ 39, citing <em>John F Kennedy Memorial Hosp v Heston, </em>58 NJ 576; 279 A2d 670 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b766-6\">Dr. Kevorkian\u2019s actions are within the scope of the state\u2019s protected interests. To the extent that a country sanctions the assisted suicide of the suffering, it does so at the risk of harm to its most vulnerable of citizens: e.g., the elderly and the clinically depressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-7\">Furthermore, extending the right to any suffering person making a rational decision almost begs the question. It has been widely acknowledged that most individuals who attempt suicide are suffering from depression, hopelessness, or lack of social interaction. Often such attempts are merely \"cries for help.\u201d There are also socioeconomic pressures on individuals that make them consider suicide as a means of relief. Circumstances such as grief, prejudice, oppression, or teenage stress are often the reasons cited by people attempting suicide. Marzen, O\u2019Dowd, Crone &amp; Balch, <em>Suicide: A constitutional right?, </em>24 Duq LR1 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b766-8\">Therefore, the state has a right to legislate in this area. However, the state\u2019s interests diminish as death nears for a terminally ill person; the interests are no longer sufficient to outweigh an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>individual\u2019s right to self-determination. Such an outcome would be consistent with <em>Compassion in Dying, supra, </em>in which the court recognized the right of mentally competent, terminally ill adults to knowingly and voluntarily hasten their deaths.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-5\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b767-6\">The statute at issue should be deemed facially invalid because it bans all assisted suicides. A terminally ill individual who is suffering from great pain and who has made a competent decision should have a constitutional due process right to hasten his death. Because plaintiffs are in a position to now make a choice that I believe should survive any challenge from the state, I would hold that the statute represents an undue burden on that right.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-7\">The assumption that the recognition of this right would be problematic in its administration is not an appropriate consideration when determining the existence of a fundamental right. Indeed, constitutional litigation often creates the necessity to draw abstract lines that in practice are not easily workable. Nevertheless, the recognition of fundamental rights requires choices in these areas that are not readily ascribable to any particular administrative device.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-8\">We need only look to the development of the living will as an example of guidelines in the death and dying area that work effectively and remain constitutional. Pursuant to MCL 700.496; MSA 27.5496, a competent person already has the right to document the desire to refuse lifesaving medical treatment. While such documentation provides us with the right to refuse life-sustaining treatment, our laws currently do not permit us to choose to end our suffering as we near death <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>through physician-prescribed medications. If we were allowed such an opportunity, our own reasoned judgment would prevail in each case.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-5\">There is no adequate distinction between the right of a terminally ill person to refuse unwanted medical treatment and the right to physician-assisted suicide. There is no sense in disallowing the competent choice to have a physician intervene to relieve intolerable suffering at the end of one\u2019s life. Furthermore, such a result conflicts with what many of us would desire when faced with severe pain and an inevitable death.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-6\">Many citizens of this state are disturbed by defendant Kevorkian\u2019s crusade and, at the same time, wish to see a resolution of the difficulties facing the terminally ill. Perhaps even more troubling is that, under this law, an individual is forbidden from consulting with a private, trusted physician about such matters. The recognition of a right to make such private decisions with a trusted physician would allow open and honest discussion with the patient of all options and consequences.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-7\">Substantive due process cases invariably address those rights that are considered so fundamental that they cannot be unduly burdened by the state. Here, it is fundamentally wrong not to allow a competent, terminally ill person who is suffering from great pain the opportunity to die with some dignity.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-8\">Therefore, I would hold that the plaintiffs may assert a constitutional right to physician-assisted suicide if it can be shown that they have made a competent decision and are suffering from great pain. I would further allow, consistent with <em>Cru</em>zan, that the state may require proof of such a competent decision by clear and convincing evidence if it chooses to so legislate.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-9\">I would reverse the judgment of the Court of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>Appeals and allow plaintiffs to document their intent to receive physician-prescribed medications should their terminal illnesses progress to the point of great pain.</p>\n<judges id=\"b769-5\">Levin, J., concurred with Mallett, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b752-9\"> In <em>Griswold v Connecticut, </em>381 US 479, 500-501; 85 S Ct 1678; 14 L Ed 2d 510 (1965), in concurrence, Justice Harlan outlined the criteria for reviewing constitutional claims brought pursuant to the Due Process Clause stating that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b752-10\">the proper constitutional inquiry in this case is whether [the] statute infringes the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment because the enactment violates basic values \"implicit in the concept of ordered liberty,\u201d ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b752-11\">While the relevant inquiry may be aided by resort to one or more of the provisions of the Bill of Rights, it is not dependent on them or any of their radiations.

In <em>Griswold, supra, </em>the United States Supreme Court recognized that decisions of married couples concerning procreation are private in character. In <em>Thornburgh v American College of Obstetricians &amp; Gynecologists, </em>476 US 747, 777, n 5; 106 S Ct 2169; 90 L Ed 2d 779 (1986), Justice Stevens observed that \"the concept of privacy embodies the 'moral fact that a person belongs to himself and not others nor to society as a whole.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b753-8\">The present case is also analogous to the family or bodily integrity cases to the extent these cases extended liberty interests to matters of public social concern. In <em>Washington v Harper, </em>494 US 210; 110 S Ct 1028; 108 L Ed 2d 178 (1990), the Court found that an inmate has a significant liberty interest under the Due Process Clause in avoiding the unwanted administration of drugs. However, the Court found that the state\u2019s compelling interest outweighed the inmate\u2019s personal liberty interest. In <em>Loving v Virginia, </em>388 US 1; 87 S Ct 1817; 18 L Ed 2d 1010 (1967), the Court held that couples have a liberty interest to marry outside of their own race.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b754-6\"> The United States Constitution does not, rior could it, specifically spell out each right a person maintains as an individual. The application of the express constitutional principles embodied in the Bill of Rights resolves only the easiest cases. Emanating from these principles, however, are implied rights and interests that are no less important to individual liberties than those specifically provided in the Bill of Rights. <em>Griswold v </em>Connecticut, n 1 <em>supra. </em>These rights lie within the parameters of the Bill of Rights, applicable to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-7\">Under the First Amendment, these unarticulated rights include the freedom to associate and privacy in one\u2019s associations, <em>NAACP v Alabama ex rel Patterson, 357 </em>US 449, 462; 78 S Ct 1163; 2 L Ed 2d 1488 (1958); the right to educate a child in a school of the parent\u2019s choice, <em>Pierce </em>v <em>Society of Sisters, </em>268 US 510; 45 S Ct 571; 69 L Ed 1070 (1925); and the right to study the German language in a private school, <em>Meyer v Nebraska, </em>262 US 390; 43 S Ct 625; 67 L Ed 1042 (1923). Tangential to the Fourth Amendment right to be free from unlawful search and seizure is a limited right to be free from the unlawful withdrawal of blood. <em>Schmerber v California, </em>384 US 757; 86 S Ct 1826; 16 L Ed 2d 908 (1966). Attached to the Ninth Amendment is the historical recognition that additional rights exist outside the constitution\u2019s plain wording.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b754-9\">The language and history of the Ninth Amendment reveal that the Framers of the Constitution believed that there are additional fundamental rights, protected from governmental infringement, which exist alongside those fundamental rights specifically mentioned in the first eight constitutional amendments. <em>[Griswold, supra </em>at 488 (Goldberg, J., concurring).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b754-10\">The concept that courts may construct new liberty rights pursuant to the Fourteenth Amendment is well established. Pursuant to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>Fourteenth Amendment, there is a fundamental right to marry a person of another race. <em>Loving v Virginia, supra. </em>Married persons have the right to receive medical advice regarding contraception. <em>Griswold v Connecticut, supra; Eisenstadt v Baird, </em>405 US 438; 92 S Ct 1029; 31 L Ed 2d 349 (1972) (extending the right to unmarried persons); <em>Carey v Population Services Int\u2019l, </em>431 US 678; 97 S Ct 2010; 52 L Ed 2d 675 (1977) (recognizing the right to sell and distribute contraceptives).</p>\n<p id=\"b755-9\">Also pursuant to the Fourteenth Amendment is the line of cases protecting a person\u2019s right of personal autonomy and self-determination. Part of the right to personal autonomy is the right to refuse unwanted medical treatment, <em>Washington v Harper, supra, </em>and of course the right to receive an abortion, <em>Roe v Wade, </em>410 US 113; 93 S Ct 705; 35 L Ed 2d 147 (1973); <em>Casey, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b755-10\">This is not an exhaustive list of the rights that lie within the penumbras of the Bill of Rights, both in terms of the cases already decided as well as those to be decided in the future. As Justice Harlan declared in dissent in <em>Poe v Ullman, </em>367 US 497, 543; 81 S Ct 1752; 6 L Ed 2d 989 (1961), these matters fall all along the \"rational continuum\u201d of rights. It is a mistake to focus on whether physician-assisted suicide is a right textually demonstrable within the body of the constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-11\">The individual liberty interest in ending one\u2019s suffering during terminal illness lies within the penumbras of the Ninth and Fourteenth Amendments. Furthermore, there is a privacy right emanating from the Fourteenth Amendment to seek guidance from a physician of choice so that an informed and knowledgeable decision can be made. As with the right to abortion, the right in the present case may be identified either as a privacy or liberty right.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b756-10\"> Indeed there is a great deal of historical antecedence for the proposition that abortion is a criminal offense. See <em>Roe </em>at 129-141 (tracing the criminal history of abortion).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b756-11\"> See <em>In re Rosebush, </em>195 Mich App 675; 491 NW2d 633 (1992) (allowing the parents of a minor the right to determine whether life-sustaining treatment should be withheld or withdrawn from the minor).

[MCL 700.496(7)(d); MSA 27.5496(7)(d).]</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b758-9\"> Recent polls show increasing support for physician-assisted suicide under certain circumstances. In August, 1993, the Journal of Family Practice reported on a survey conducted by the Harvard School of Public Health that 61 percent of all Americans would vote for an initiative legalizing physician-assisted suicide. Furthermore, 52 percent of Americans would consider such an option if it was legal and they were terminally ill and suffering from great pain.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-10\">This sentiment also has support among the medical communities of the United States and other westernized nations. A survey of 156 internists and surgeons revealed that 61 percent agreed that doctors were currently practicing euthanasia by either accelerating death or withholding treatment. See Messinger, <em>A gentle and easy death: From ancient Greece to beyond </em>Cruzan <em>toward a reasoned legal response to the societal dilemma of euthanasia, </em>71 Den ULR 175, 201 (1993). Out of 354 physicians responding to a survey conducted by the Medical Journal of Australia, 107 had provided the means by which patients could hasten their deaths. However, the number was twice as high for physicians who thought the law should be changed to allow it in some circumstances. In Britain, 273 physicians responded to a similar survey, and over half would consider physician-assisted suicide in some circumstances if it were legal.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-11\">Most recently, voters in the State of Oregon approved a referendum (the Death with Dignity Act) that would allow physician-assisted suicide under carefully regulated circumstances. Physicians may pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>scribe suicide pills to patients with less than six months to live, but only after a second medical opinion and three requests from the patient are received. The patient must also be mentally competent and free from clinical depression.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b759-12\"> In <em>Casey, </em>112 S Ct 2804, the Court reaffirmed <em>Roe\u2019s </em>essential three-part holding:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b759-13\">First is a recognition of the right of the woman to choose to have an abortion before viability and to obtain it without undue interference from the State. Before viability, the State\u2019s interests are not strong enough to support a prohibition of abortion or the imposition of a substantial obstacle to the woman\u2019s effective right to elect the procedure. Second is a confirmation of the State\u2019s power to restrict abortions after fetal viability, if the law contains exceptions for pregnancies which endanger a woman\u2019s life or health. And third is the principle that the State has legitimate interests from the outset of the pregnancy in protecting the health of the woman and the life of the fetus that may become a child.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b762-6\"> In the only other case directly addressing the constitutionality of an assisted suicide law, <em>Compassion in Dying v Washington, supra, </em>the court was asked to rule on the constitutionality of the State of Washington\u2019s assisted suicide law.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-7\">The court stated that abortion raises even more difficult questions about competing interests than does suicide by the terminally ill. \"In reproductive rights cases, there is not only the interest of the pregnant woman seeking an abortion, but also the potential life interest which cannot speak for itself. By contrast, in the case of assisted suicide involving a competent person, only one life is involved and that individual can voice his or her wishes.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1460. Significantly, the court found that the \"concept of existence\u201d language from <em>Casey </em>was \"almost prescriptive\u201d of recognizing the right of an individual to commit suicide. <em>Id. </em>at 1459, citing <em>Casey, supra, </em>112 S Ct 2807.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-8\">The court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b762-9\">\"[T]he suffering of a terminally ill person cannot be deemed any less intimate or personal, or any less deserving of protection from unwarranted governmental interference, than that of a pregnant woman. Thus, consonant with the reasoning in <em>Casey, </em>such an intimate personal decision <em>falls within the realm of the liberties constitutionally protected under the Fourteenth Amendment.\u201d [Id. </em>at 1460. Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b763-8\"> 1 have signed my colleague\u2019s opinion (Levin, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part), and recognize that a person who is terminally ill and suffering from great pain <em>and is facing an imminent death </em>falls within the confines of the due process right I would recognize here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b765-6\"> See also <em>Quinlan, supra </em>at 41.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b765-7\">We think that the State\u2019s interest . . . weakens and the individual\u2019s right to privacy grows as the degree of bodily invasion increases and the prognosis dims.

Here, it is the individual <em>who, </em>in the appropriate circumstances, should make the decision to hasten death through physician-prescribed medications.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b765-9\"> [T]he common-law doctrine of informed consent is viewed as generally encompassing the right of a competent individual to refuse medical treatment. <em>[Cruzan, supra </em>at 277.]</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
