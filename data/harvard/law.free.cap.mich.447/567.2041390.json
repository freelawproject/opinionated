(Cavanagh, C.J., and Levin, Brickley, Boyle, and Mallett, JJ.)</p>\n<p id=\"b797-6\">(3) Oral sexual conduct committed in a public place is grossly indecent under MCL 750.338; MSA 28.570. (Cavanagh, C.J., and Levin, Brickley, Boyle, Riley, Griffin, and Mallett, JJ.)</p>\n<p id=\"b797-8\">(4) Procuring or attempting to procure the specific sexual conduct alleged in <em>Brashier </em>with a person under the age of consent can support a conviction under MCL 750.338; MSA 28.570, regardless of whether the conduct is performed in public. (Cavanagh, C.J., and Levin, Riley, Griffin, and Mallett, JJ.)</p>\n<p id=\"b797-9\">In <em>Lino, </em>we reverse the decision of the Court of Appeals and we affirm the defendant\u2019s conviction. Fellatio performed in a public place clearly falls within the ambit of MCL 750.338; MSA 28.570.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-10\">In <em>Brashier, </em>we reverse the decision of the Court of Appeals in part and affirm in part. Defendant Brashier\u2019s case is remanded to the trial court so that he may stand trial. Procuring or attempting to procure the specific sexual conduct alleged in <em>Brashier </em>with a person under the age of consent can support a conviction under MCL 750.338; MSA</p>\n<p id=\"b797-11\">28.570, regardless of whether the conduct is performed in public.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-12\">ii</p>\n<p id=\"b797-13\">A. <em>PEOPLE v LINO</em></p>\n<p id=\"b797-14\">On August 23, 1988, several officers, including <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>officers Smith and Ferguson, were investigating complaints of prostitution in the Michigan Avenue and Larch Street area of Lansing. Smith and Ferguson noticed defendant Lino walking on Larch, waving at passing cars. Lino was dressed as a woman; however, from past experience the officers knew that Lino was a man. The police followed a tan pickup truck that picked up Lino. The pickup eventually came to a stop in the overflow parking lot at DeMarco\u2019s restaurant.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-6\">The overflow parking lot was enclosed by a six-to eight-foot tall wooden fence on the north and east sides. The south side of the lot is open to the street. There is also an opening on the north side of the fence that allows pedestrian traffic. Although DeMarco\u2019s was open for business at the time of the incident (approximately 12:30 a.m.), there were no other vehicles in the overflow lot.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-7\">Officer Ferguson testified that, while he was behind the fence to the north, he saw the driver of the truck lean back in his seat and the defendant\u2019s head moving over the driver\u2019s lap. It was not until the officer climbed up three feet on the fence that he witnessed the defendant performing oral sex (fellatio) on the driver of the pickup truck.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-8\">Officer Smith testified that from his vantage point at the pedestrian opening on the north fence, approximately twenty feet away from the vehicle, he saw the driver sitting in the driver\u2019s seat while the defendant bent down out of sight. Officer Smith approached the vehicle and observed the defendant performing oral sex on the driver.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-9\">The driver of the truck testified that when he picked up the defendant, the defendant offered to perform oral sex for money. After arriving at the parking lot, the driver paid the defendant twenty dollars and the events, as described, occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-10\">Judge Peter Houk presided at the defendant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>jury trial. Following the state\u2019s proofs, the defense moved for a directed verdict, claiming that the prosecution failed to present sufficient evidence that the act was committed \"openly and in a public place.\u201d Judge Houk denied the motion. The jury found the defendant guilty of gross indecency between males, MCL 750.338; MSA 28.570, under the standard announced by the plurality opinion in <em>People v Howell, </em>396 Mich 16; 238 NW2d 148 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b799-6\">On appeal, the defendant claimed that (1) there was insufficient evidence that the act took place in a public place, (2) the gross indecency statute is unconstitutionally vague as applied, and (3) the trial court erred by not instructing the jury under the \"common sense of the society standard.\u201d The Court of Appeals reversed the defendant\u2019s conviction using the <em>Howell </em>test and reasoning that the prosecution failed to present sufficient evidence that the act occurred in a public place. 190 Mich App 715, 721; 476 NW2d 654 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b799-7\">This Court initially denied the prosecutor\u2019s application for leave to appeal, but the prosecutor\u2019s motion for reconsideration was granted. 443 Mich 882 (1993). We ordered that <em>Lino </em>be submitted with <em>People v Brashier.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b799-8\">B. <em>PEOPLE v BRASHIER</em></p>\n<p id=\"b799-9\">Brashier was charged in four separate informations. In each, a fourteen- or fifteen-year-old boy was victimized by Brashier and codefendant Goike. These events occurred in November and December of 1989.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-10\">The details varied, but the basic theme was the same. Defendant Brashier would strike up a conversation with the minor victim, eventually asking whether the victim was interested in earning some <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>money by \"beatin\u2019 up a queer.\u201d Defendant Bra-shier would buy the minor victims lunch and then take them to a hotel room where codefendant Goike was waiting.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-6\">With Brashier directing the proceedings, the minors would physically and verbally abuse Goike, while Goike masturbated. The minors would hit Goike with a stick, urinate on him, vomit on him, pour syrup on him, and force him to consume combinations of these materials. All the while, Goike would continue to masturbate, eventually to climax.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-7\">For the most part, defendant Brashier\u2019s participation was limited to directing the activities. At times, he would actively participate in the abuse of Goike. At the end of these sessions, the minors were paid and threatened with harm if they ever revealed what happened.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-8\">There was never any direct physical sexual contact between the victims and either Brashier or Goike.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-9\">In separate informations corresponding to the four minors, these defendants were charged with one count of procuring or attempting to procure the commission of an act of gross indecency between the male minor victim and another male (the codefendant). In the circuit court, the defendant filed a motion to quash. Oakland Circuit Court Judge Fred Mester denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-10\">The Court of Appeals reversed on interlocutory appeal, holding that the adoption of the <em>Howell </em>test by the <em>Lino </em>panel compelled the result. On the prosecutor\u2019s petition, the Court of Appeals agreed to convene a special panel to resolve the conflict between the <em>Howell </em>standard and the commonsense-of-the-community standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-11\">The special panel issued a per curiam opinion rejecting the <em>Howell </em>standard for gross indecency <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>and adopting the common-sense-of-the-community standard. 197 Mich App 672, 679; 496 NW2d 385 (1992) . The three concurring judges would have adopted the <em>Howell </em>test; however, they agreed that this defendant nevertheless could be bound over. This Court granted leave to appeal, 443 Mich 882 (1993) .</p>\n<p id=\"b801-8\">in</p>\n<p id=\"b801-9\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b801-10\">Defendants challenge MCL 750.338; MSA 28.570,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> as being unconstitutionally vague.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In order to pass constitutional muster, a penal statute must define the criminal offense \"with sufficient definiteness that ordinary people can understand what conduct is prohibited and in a manner that does not encourage arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement.\u201d <em>Kolender v Lawson, </em>461 US 352, 357; 103 S Ct 1855; 75 L Ed 2d 903 (1983) (citations omitted). Vagueness challenges that do not implicate First Amendment freedoms are examined in light of the facts of each particular case. <em>Howell </em>at 21. When making a vagueness determination, a court must also take into consideration any judicial constructions of the statute. <em>Kolender </em>at 355.</p>\n<p id=\"A1O\">Thus, there are at least three ways a penal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>statute may be found unconstitutionally vague: (1) failure to provide fair notice of what conduct is prohibited, (2) encouragement of arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement, or (3) being overbroad and impinging on First Amendment freedoms.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Howell </em>at 20-21, n 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-6\">Defendant Lino\u2019s vagueness challenge fails because it is clear that a number of cases hold that the public act of fellatio between males is encompassed within the scope of the gross indecency statute; See <em>Howell </em>at 22, and <em>People v Kalchik, </em>160 Mich App 40, 45-46; 407 NW2d 627 (1987). Lino had fair notice that public fellatio between males is prohibited by the statute, and, correspondingly, the statute does not create a risk of arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-7\">Nor is the statute vague as it applies to Mr. Brashier. He cannot plausibly claim that he could not have known his conduct was prohibited. In <em>McSherry v </em>Block, 880 F2d 1049 (CA 9, 1989), cert den 499 US 943 (1991),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, rejected a vagueness challenge brought by a defendant convicted of \"loiter[ing]\u201d under a California statute that provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b802-8\">Every person who loiters about any school or public place at or near which children attend or normally congregate and who remains at any school or public place at or near which children attend or normally congregate, or who reenters or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>comes upon such school or place within 72 hours, after being asked to leave ... is a vagrant .... [Cal Penal Code, \u00a7 653g.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b803-6\">Although it was undisputed that the petitioner had not been asked to leave, \"[t]he evidence at trial consisted of highly incriminatory observations of the appellant at five different schools, other relevant observations of his behavior, and his prior convictions for kidnapping a minor and lewd conduct with a girl under the age of eighteen.\u201d 880 F2d 1051. The court rioted that \"[i]n applying the rule against vagueness or overbroadness something . . . should depend on the moral quality of the conduct.\u201d Freund, <em>The supreme court and civil liberties, </em>4 Vand LR 533, 540 (1951), quoted with approval in <em>Bouie v City of Columbia, 378 US </em>347, 362, n 9; 84 S Ct 1697; 12 L Ed 2d 894 (1964).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The court stated that it was placing \"considerable emphasis on this factor,\u201d in rejecting the petitioner\u2019s vagueness challenge. 880 F2d 1055.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-7\">In <em>Rose v Locke, </em>423 US 48, 51; 96 S Ct 243; 46 L Ed 2d 185 (1975), the United States Supreme Court said: \"[Although <em>[Wainwright v Stone, </em>414 US 21; 94 S Ct 190; 38 L Ed 2d 179 (1973)] demonstrated that the existence of previous applications of a particular statute to one set of facts forecloses lack-of-fair-warning challenges to subsequent prosecutions of factually identical conduct, it did not hold that such applications were a prerequisite to a statute\u2019s withstanding constitutional attack.\u201d In that case, the United States <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>Supreme Court upheld a conviction for forced cunniling\u00fas under a Missouri statute proscribing \"crime[s] against nature,\u201d despite the fact that Missouri courts had never applied the statute to the precise facts of the defendant\u2019s case. Brashier was therefore on notice that sexual activity involving persons under the age of consent could constitute the statutory crime of gross indecency.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-4\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b804-5\">With respect to defendant Lino, fellatio performed in a public place clearly falls within the ambit of the gross indecency statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-6\">With respect to defendant Brashier, we remand his case to the trial court so that he may stand trial. If proven true, Brashier\u2019s alleged conduct in orchestrating the conduct of the minors, to facilitate Goike\u2019s sexual arousal and masturbation in the presence of the minors would constitute the offense of procuring, or attempting to procure, an act of gross indecency even though it was not committed in a public place. Procuring or attempting to procure an act of gross indecency with a person under the age of consent can support a conviction under MCL 750.338; MSA 28.570, regardless of whether the conduct is performed in public.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-7\">c</p>\n<p id=\"b804-8\">This memorandum opinion is signed by the seven participating justices. There are separate concurring and dissenting opinions. However, at least four justices concur in every holding, statement, and disposition of this memorandum opinion.</p>\n<author id=\"b804-9\">Levin, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AkJ\"><em>(separate </em>opinion). We all agree that Luciano Lino was subject to prosecution for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>offense of gross indecency between male persons<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> on presentation of sufficient evidence that he performed oral sex (fellatio) with another man in public.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b806-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>I agree with the majority<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> that Edward Brashier is subject to prosecution for gross indecency between male persons on presentation of sufficient evidence that he procured minors to perform fetishes to arouse Paul Goike sexually while Goike was masturbating to climax, even though the conduct was not in public and the minors and Goike did not touch each other.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>_</p>\n<p id=\"AQR\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b807-5\">The question shrouded under the sheets, and veiled behind the pages, of the several opinions, is whether it constitutes the felony of gross indecency for consenting adults to engage in oral, anal, or manual sex in private.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b807-7\">Lino is subject to prosecution, if at all, on presentation of sufficient evidence that a sexual act was committed in public, not because oral sex between consenting adults itself is grossly indecent. A married man and woman would be subject to prosecution for gross, indecency between a male and a female person<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> if they were to engage in \u201cnormal\u201d heterosexual intercourse in public._</p>\n<p id=\"b808-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>I would hold, following the lead of the Court of Appeals of Maryland in <em>Schochet v Maryland, </em>320 Md 714; 580 A2d 176 (1990), that it does not constitute the felony of gross indecency for adults to engage in oral sex (fellatio, cunnilingus) or anal sex, or manual sex, including masturbation or other manual penetration or arousal, as long as the activity is consensual and in private.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>_</p>\n<p id=\"b809-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>Schochet had been acquitted by the jury of rape, anal intercourse, sodomy, and fellatio of the complaining witness by force or threat of force against her will and without her consent, but convicted of committing \"a certain unnatural and perverted sexual practice,\u201d namely fellatio, with the complaining witness. <em>Id., </em>p 718.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-5\">Schochet alleged that the statute criminalizing \"unnatural and perverted sexual practice\u201d on evidence of fellatio was unconstitutional as applied to private and noncommercial sexual acts between consenting heterosexual adults._</p>\n<p id=\"b810-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>Maryland\u2019s highest court said that the principle that a statute should be construed to avoid constitutional questions<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> was applicable, and that, to avoid deciding whether criminalizing fellatio was unconstitutional, it would hold that the statute did not encompass consensual, noncommercial heterosexual activity between adults in the privacy of a home. Schochet\u2019s conviction was reversed, with the direction that a judgment of acquittal be entered.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b810-7\">Instructions to a jury should be clear that the accused cannot be convicted of the offense of gross indecency because it might be thought by some or many members of the community that oral, anal, or manual sex is grossly indecent, or that sex between a transvestite<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and another man, or between persons who are not married to each other, or in exchange for the payment of money or other consideration,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> is grossly indecent.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-8\">After the superpanel decision of the Court of Appeals in <em>People v Brashier, </em>197 Mich App 672; 496 NW2d 385 (1992), a new standard criminal jury instruction, replacing an instruction based on the definition of gross indecency set forth in the plurality opinion in <em>People v Howell, </em>396 Mich 16; 238 NW2d 148 (1976),<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> was promulgated by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>Michigan State Bar Standing Committee on Standard Criminal Jury Instructions, which was established under the authority of this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-6\">The new standard instruction allows a jury to decide whether the sexual act charged in the information constitutes an act of gross indecency. The new standard instruction reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b811-7\">(1) The defendant is charged with the crime of committing an act of gross indecency with another person. To prove this charge, the prosecutor must prove each of the following elements beyond a reasonable doubt:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b811-8\">(2) First, that the defendant voluntarily committed a sexual act with another person.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b811-9\">(3) Second, that this sexual act was an act of gross indecency. <em>An act is grossly indecent if it is of such a character that the common Sense of society regards it as indecent and improper. </em>[CJI2d 20.31. Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b811-10\">This new standard instruction shows the deficiency of the common-sense-of-the-community<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> definit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>ion, absent further direction from this Court. This new standard instruction does not, in contrast with the former instruction, state that where consenting adults are the only persons involved, the accused may be convicted of gross indecency only if the jury finds that the sexual act was committed in public.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-6\">Nor does the new standard instruction state\u2014as the old instruction in effect provided\u2014that an oral, anal, or manual sexual act between consenting adults in private is not an act of gross indecency. Nor does the new standard instruction state\u2014as the old instruction in effect provided\u2014that whether a sexual act is grossly indecent does not depend on whether the act is heterosexual or between gays or lesbians.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-7\">c</p>\n<p id=\"b812-8\">Unless a majority of this Court is prepared to affirm a jury verdict finding that oral, anal, or manual sex in private between consenting adult heterosexuals, or gays or lesbians, is grossly indecent, a majority of this Court should <em>preclude such a prosecution </em>or conviction by providing an alternative standard instruction that <em>does not permit the prosecution </em>or conviction of consenting adults under any such circumstances for the commission of such acts in private.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-9\">Even if a prosecutor knows that he might not be able to obtain a conviction, he may ruin a person, such as an elected official, by bringing the prosecution. Permitting a prosecutor to commence a prosecution and cause arrests for, and conduct a preliminary examination concerning, and the trier of fact, generally a jury, to decide whether sexual acts committed by consenting adults in private <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>constitute acts of gross indecency, poses a substantial risk of abuse.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b813-6\">This Court should not wait until long after a prosecutor in one of the eighty-three counties files an information against gays or lesbians or heterosexuals for consensual sexual acts committed in private to rein in unstructured prosecutorial/jury discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-7\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b813-8\">Penalties are provided by the criminal sexual conduct act to cover nonconsensual sexual behavior, or sexual behavior with a person under the age of consent.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> In addition to the gross indecency charge, Brashier was charged with contributing to the delinquency of a child under the age of seventeen,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> with accosting, enticing, or soliciting a child under the age of sixteen years to commit an immoral act,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> and with conspiracy to commit an offense prohibited by law.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b813-9\">It, therefore, appears that there is little, or at least less, need to continue to include within the definition of gross indecency sexual acts committed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>without consent, or with a person under the age of consent,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> or, indeed, for a definition of gross indecency stating <em>what constitutes gross indecency.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b814-5\">There is, however, clearly a need\u2014to avoid conferring unstructured discretion on the prosecutor/ trier of fact to determine whether an offense has been committed\u2014for this Court to state <em>what does not constitute gross indecency, </em>and specifically for this Court to state that oral, anal, or manual sexual acts committed in private by consenting adults are not grossly indecent.

The Court nevertheless .then construed the statute so that it would be consistent with the obscenity definition set forth in <em>Miller v California, </em>413 US 15; 93 S Ct 2607; 37 L Ed 2d 419 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b816-6\">In <em>Commonwealth v Balthazar, </em>366 Mass 298; 318 NE2d 478 (1974), the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts held that a statute barring unnatural and lascivious acts was not vague as applied to the defendant, but nevertheless narrowed an earlier construction of the statute to remedy vagueness.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-7\">In <em>Pryor v Municipal Court of Los Angeles, </em>25 Cal 3d 238, 253; 158 Cal Rptr 330; 599 P2d 636 (1979), a statute prohibiting solicitation o\u00ed \"lewd\u201d and \"dissolute\u201d conduct, was held not to be vague as applied to the defendant. The California Supreme Court nevertheless adopted a narrowing construction to remedy vagueness, and said: \"The judiciary bears an obligation to 'construe enactments to give specific content to terms that might otherwise be unconstitutionally vague.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark>_</p>\n<p id=\"b817-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b817-4\">A criminal statute must provide fair warning of the conduct it prohibits, and may not vest law enforcement officials and juries with unbridled discretion to determine the conduct that is prohibited. <em>Kolender v Lawson, </em>461 US 352, 357; 103 S Ct 1855; 75 L Ed 2d 903 (1983).

The court, to remedy vagueness, held that the \"unnatural and lascivious acts\u201d statute would no longer apply to private consensual sexual relations between adults. The court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b818-6\">In light of these changes [developments in the right to privacy] and <em>in light of our own awareness that community values on the subject of permissible sexual conduct no longer are as monolithic as the </em>Jaquith <em>case suggested they were in 1954, we conclude that </em>[Mass Ann Laws, ch 272, <em>\u00a7 35] must be construed to be inapplicable to private, consensual conduct of adults. </em>We do so on the ground that the concept of general community disapproval of specific sexual conduct, which is inherent in \u00a7 35, requires such an interpretation. <em>[Balthazar, supra, </em>p 302. Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b818-7\">The court held, however, that because Balthazar <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>had been convicted of forcing a woman to engage in sexual relations, the statute could be applied to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-4\">When Balthazar sought a writ of habeas corpus, the federal courts joined Massachusetts\u2019 highest court in recognizing the impermissible vagueness of a criminal statute that bases liability on community standards. The United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b819-5\">While a state may have a legitimate interest in protecting community sensibilities, criminal liability should only attach to clearly delineated transgression. Currents of community standards are constantly shifting. These changes are sometime subtle. Standards are apt to vary from generation to generation without the specific awareness of either generation. This is true in the area of private sexual conduct, among others. <em>[Balthazar v Superior Court of Massachusetts, </em>428 F Supp 425, 433 (D Mass, 1977).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b819-6\">On appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit, the court said that the \"District Court was rightly concerned that the use of constantly shifting community standards, as the test of what conduct falls within the terms of a criminal statute, places the public 'at its peril to anticipate a judicial pronouncement that public standards of morality have changed.\u20195,<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> <em>Balthazar v Superior Court of Massachusetts, </em>573 F2d 698, 701 (CA 1, 1978).<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AA_\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>B</p>\n<p id=\"b820-5\">The \"common sense of the community\u201d definition vests the community\u2014law enforcement officials and juries\u2014with discretion to criminalize sexual behavior it finds offensive. This discretion conflicts with the United States Supreme Court\u2019s recent statement \"that the more important aspect of the vagueness doctrine \u2019is not actual notice, but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>the other principal element of the doctrine\u2014the requirement that a legislature establish minimal guidelines to govern law enforcement.\u2019 \u201d <em>Kolender, supra, </em>p 358. Where the legislature fails to enact such guidelines, the Court explained, \"a criminal statute may permit 'a standardless sweep [that] allows policemen, prosecutors, and juries to pursue their personal predilections.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b821-6\">Under the \"common sense of the community\u201d definition, police, prosecutors, and especially juries make the sort of standardless sweep of sexual behavior prohibited in <em>Kolender. </em>As stated by the Supreme Court of Alaska, in holding that a statute proscribing the \"crime against nature\u201d was void for vagueness: \"[w]e cannot allow criminality to depend only upon the moral sentiment or idiosyncracies of the tribunal before which a defendant is tried.\u201d <em>Harris v State, </em>457 P2d 638, 641 (Alas, 1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b821-7\">In a gross indecency prosecution under the common sense of the community definition, the prosecutor is not required to call \"expert\u201d witnesses to provide evidence concerning the common sense of the community. The prosecutor simply presents proof of the allegedly indecent act. The judge then instructs the jury that if it finds that the defendant committed the act and that the act offends the common sense of the community, it should convict. The jury thus becomes the arbiter of what constitutes the common sense of the community.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b821-8\">There is no fixed yardstick against which to measure the jury\u2019s conclusion that the act in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>question violates the \"common sense of the community.\u201d Because the jury <em>is </em>\"the community,\u201d its determination that an act offends the common sense of the community would ordinarily decide the matter. Under the \"common sense of the community\u201d definition, a reviewing court would find it difficult to decide that the \"community\u201d misapplied its own \"common sense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b822-6\">The United States Supreme Court\u2019s obscenity jurisprudence<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> shows the importance of substantive limitations (\"fixed yardsticks\u201d) in criminal statutes. In <em>Jenkins v Georgia, </em>418 US 153, 159; 94 S Ct 2750; 41 L Ed 2d 642 (1974), the Court reversed a decision of the Georgia Supreme Court that affirmed the defendant\u2019s obscenity conviction for showing the movie \"Carnal Knowledge.\u201d In the United States Supreme Court, the State of Georgia argued that the question whether the film was obscene was \"a question of fact for the jury, and that the jury having resolved this question against appellant, and there being some evidence to support its findings, the judgment of conviction should be affirmed.\u201d The Court unanimously rejected Georgia\u2019s argument that the jury\u2019s verdict must be affirmed simply because there was some evidence to support it, and the implication that an obscenity conviction must be affirmed whenever a jury determines that the material violated \"community standards.\u201d<footnotemark>28</footnotemark>_</p>\n<p id=\"b823-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>The <em>Jenkins </em>decision<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> shows that an obscenity <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>conviction cannot rest on a jury\u2019s ad hoc, ad hominem application of community standards.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> An obscenity conviction must be consistent with \"substantive constitutional limitations.\u201d <em>Id., </em>p 160.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-6\">The common sense of the community definition is devoid of substantive limitations. The common sense of the community definition is the <em>Miller </em>definition for obscenity <em>minus </em>any substantive limitations like those found in <em>Miller. </em>It is, in short, the test for obscenity squarely rejected in <em>Jenkins.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b824-7\">The Supreme Court of California recently observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b824-8\">The obscenity test as developed in Supreme Court decisions was <em>not framed to measure non-communicative conduct; </em>with no audience to be aroused pruriently or redeemed socially, <em>all that is left of the test is the appeal to contemporary community standards. That appeal is the vaguest part of the test and, standing alone, does not provide a sufficient standard to judge the criminality of conduct. [Pryor, supra, </em>p 250.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b824-9\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b824-10\">In <em>Lino, </em>the jury was instructed that the prosecutor must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the act was \"committed .openly and in a public place,\u201d and, apparently, so found.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark>_</p>\n<p id=\"b825-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>We all agree, that a person, man or woman, who commits fellatio, in public has committed an \"act of gross indecency.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b825-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b825-6\">The meaning of \"public\u201d is not, however, self-evident. The New York Court of Appeals explained that, \"[b]ecause the term 'public place\u2019 has no cut- and-dried meaning, it is necessary to interpret and apply the statute [banning lewd public conduct] in a manner that comports with its purpose.\u201d <em>People v McNamara, </em>78 NY2d 626, 633; 585 NE2d 788 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b825-7\">The New York Court of Appeals held that New York\u2019s public lewdness statute applies only where the \"objective circumstances\u201d establish that lewd acts \"can, and likely would, be seen by the casual passerby, whose sensibilities the statute seeks to protect.\u201d <em>McNamara, supra, </em>pp 634-635. In the words of New York\u2019s highest court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b825-8\">That a member of the public may pass by is certainly part of the essence of a public place, and the harm to such a person\u2019s sensibilities is precisely that aimed at by the statute. Conversely, where no such harm is likely, the statute is not violated. <em>[Id., </em>p 633.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b825-9\">The Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts and the California Supreme Court have similarly defined the term \"public place\u201d as set forth in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>public lewdness statutes. The Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts held that to establish the \"public place\u201d element of public lewdness, \"[t]he Commonwealth must prove that the likelihood of being observed by a casual passerby must have been reasonably foreseeable to the defendant or, stated otherwise, that the defendant acted upon an unreasonable expectation that his conduct would remain secret.\u201d <em>Commonwealth v Ferguson, </em>384 Mass 13, 16; 422 NE2d 1365 (1981). In <em>Pryor, supra, </em>p 256, the California Supreme Court held that its public lewdness statute prohibited only a limited range of conduct, and only when \"the actor knows or should know of the presence of persons who may be offended by his conduct.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b826-6\">This Court should follow the lead of the highest courts of New York, Massachusetts, and California, and hold that, to establish the \"public place\u201d element of gross indecency, the prosecutor must prove that when the sexual act was committed, the objective circumstances indicated that the conduct could have been seen, and was likely to have been seen, by members of the public.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b826-7\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b826-8\">The jury in Lino\u2019s trial was not properly instructed concerning the \"public place\u201d element of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>gross indecency.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> After deliberating for approximately one-half hour, the jury asked the judge, \"[w]hat constitutes a public place and is being in a personal vehicle the same as being in a public place?\u201d The judge responded that, \"[t]here is no exact answer to the questions that you have asked.

The record does not, however, indicate that the sexual activity charged in <em>Brashier </em>was photographed or otherwise recorded so that it could be viewed on a subsequent occasion.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-6\">The statute also subjects to prosecution with a like penalty \"a person who attempts or prepares or conspires to arrange for, produce, make, or finance any child sexually abusive activity or child sexually abusive material . . . .\u201d There was no \"audience\u201d other than Brashier, and it does not appear that the conduct of the minors was for the purpose of Brashier\u2019s sexual gratification or stimulation.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b828-7\">That colleague also states that the majority of this Court today defines gross indecency as including \"any and all conduct that a jury thinks is indecent,\u201d<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> and \"[d]espite contrary protestations, [has] adopt[ed] a broad view of the statute,\u201d<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> and \"[f]aced with the unattractive prospect of finding Brashier\u2019s conduct outside the reach of the gross <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>indecency statute,\u201d<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> the majority has solved the problem by saying in effect, that gross indecency is what four members of this Court say it is.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-4\">In <em>Howell, supra, </em>a plurality of this Court defined gross indecency as including oral and manual sexual acts committed \"with\u201d a person under the age of consent.

I write separately, however, because I disagree with the Court\u2019s conclusion in <em>Brashier </em>that the gross indecency statute covers the conduct alleged.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-8\">The behavior Brashier is alleged to have procured appears to be proscribed by MCL 750.145c; MSA 28.342a, <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> which provides that a person who <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>\"finances\u201d any \"child sexually abusive activity,\u201d specifically defined to include \"sadomasochistic abuse, masturbation, [or] passive sexual involvement,\u201d is guilty of a felony punishable by up to twenty years imprisonment. It also might have been encompassed by the indecent liberties statute, formerly MCL 750.336; MSA 28.568. This statute was repealed by the Legislature in conjunction with adoption of the criminal sexual conduct statutes. 1974 PA 266.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>Whether the conduct is punishable under a different statute, however, is not the issue here. On the proofs submitted,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> defendant Brashier was not properly bound over on the charge of gross indecency.

THE PROBLEM ILLUSTRATED\u2014THE \"CRIME AGAINST NATURE\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b832-6\">Courts have faced this precise question with respect to statutes that proscribe \"sodomy\u201d or \"the crime against nature.\u201d Jurisdictions differ regarding whether such terms are limited to anal intercourse, or are to be broadly interpreted to cover all \"unnatural\u201d acts, including bestiality, fellatio, and cunnilingus. In <em>Rose v Locke, </em>423 US 48, 50-51; 96 S Ct 243; 46 L Ed 2d 185 (1975), the Supreme Court seemed to agree that \"jurisdictions differ as to whether 'crime against nature\u2019 is to be narrowly applied only to those acts constituting the common-law offense of sodomy, or is to be broadly interpreted to encompass additional forms of sexual aberration.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 50-51. The issue in that case was whether the Tennessee statute the respondent had been convicted of violating applied to cunnilingus, which would not have constituted sodomy at the common law. The Court reinstated the respondent\u2019s conviction because Tennessee had adopted the broader version of the statute, <em>id. </em>at 53, which the Court held was not unconstitutionally vague, <em>id. </em>at 52.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-7\">Although it was not uncommon in other states, including Tennessee, to add fellatio and cunnilingus to the offense of sodomy by interpretation,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Michigan followed the narrow approach by sepa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>rately proscribing fellatio and sodomy. In <em>People v </em>Schmitt, 275 Mich 575, 577; 267 NW 741 (1936), this Court reversed the defendant\u2019s conviction for sodomy because the prosecution proved only \"penetration . . . per os,\u201d or fellatio, not sodomy. The Court found that the Legislature had shown no disposition to depart from the common-law definition, observing that this conclusion was \"evidenced further\u201d by the fact that in 1931 the Legislature reenacted 1903 PA 198, which prohibited the offense of fellatio. <em>Id. </em>According to Professors Perkins and Boyce, Michigan\u2019s narrower approach</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b833-6\">is the logical position since sodomy was not an offense under the common law of England and is an offense under American common law because of the early English statute which did not apply where the act is in the mouth. [Criminal Law (3d ed), p 466.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b833-7\">Because the scope of the offense is specifically defined, it may not be expanded on the basis of what a judge or jury thinks it ought to encompass. As the Colorado Supreme Court explained in a case with facts identical to Schmitt, \"[w]e cannot, because of our belief that the act charged against the defendant is even more vile and filthy than sodomy, stretch the sodomy section of the statute to include it.\u201d <em>Koontz v </em>People, 82 Colo 589, 594; 263 P 19 (1927).</p>\n<p id=\"b833-8\">B. THE MICHIGAN GROSS INDECENCY STATUTES</p>\n<p id=\"b833-9\">Although sodomy does not as a matter of law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>include fellatio, <em>People v Schmitt, supra, </em>it does not inexorably follow that gross indecency includes only fellatio. This case hinges on the question whether the term \"gross indecency\u201d is to be construed broadly or narrowly.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b834-6\">The answer to this question begins with an examination of the statutory scheme. Gross inde<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>cency between males was not proscribed by statute until 1903.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> See 1903 PA 198, \u00a7 1. In 1931, that statute was reenacted as part of the criminal code. See 1931 PA 328, \u00a7 338.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-4\">The offenses of gross indecency between females and gross indecency between males and females were first enacted in 1939, see 1939 PA 148, only three years after a decision of this Court carrying implications for the original statute. In <em>Schmitt, </em>275 Mich 577-578, which followed the historical narrow interpretation of the sodomy statute, the Court noted that \"the offense of <em>fellatio </em>is now prohibited by [the gross indecency statute].\u201d The fact that the Legislature thereafter employed identical language in the companion statutes lends support to the argument that the statute applies only to oral-genital contact.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-5\">The very addition of those two offenses, which meant that \"gross indecency\u201d was prohibited regardless of the gender of the participants, provides additional support for the narrow interpretation. If any sexual act could constitute the offense, then the 1939 act would have instituted decency regulation for all sexual behavior. Though this interpretation of the statutes would not necessarily have prohibited all sex, it would seem to mean that any person who had sex could be bound over and tried on a felony charge. The outrageousness of this possibility is stronger evidence that the Legislature intended the statutes to apply only to a specific act or acts.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-6\">While there is a textual argument<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> for applica<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>tion of the statute to any \"unnatural\u201d or immoral act, that argument is belied by the number and variety of statutes addressing specific sexual behavior. <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The Legislature\u2019s awareness of the numerous offenses, and the distinctions between them, is illustrated in 1952 PA 73, which amended 1948 CL 750.85 to apply to \"[a]ny person who shall assault any female with intent to commit the crime of rape, and any person who shall assault another person with intent to commit the crime of sodomy or gross indecency . . . .\u201d Another example is MCL 750.145a; MSA 28.341, which makes it a misdemeanor to \"accost, entice, or solicit a child under the age of 16 with intent to induce or force said child to commit an immoral act, or to submit to an act of sexual intercourse, or an act of gross indecency, or any other act of depravity or delinquency . . . .\u201d The statute contemplates an \"act of depravity\u201d that is not an act of gross indecency.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-4\">Michigan case law also supports this view. Although early opinions of this Court hesitate to provide explicit details, they reflect a certainty</p>\n<p id=\"ASf\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>that \"particular conduct is rendered criminal by it.\u201d <em>People v Carey, </em>217 Mich 601, 603; 187 NW 261 (1922). As illustrated by the Court of Appeals in <em>People v Dexter, </em>6 Mich App 247, 250-251; 148 NW2d 915 (1967):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b837-6\">Appellant raises the question of whether the counts charging gross indecency merged into the sodomy counts. Michigan follows the common-law definition of sodomy. <em>People v Hodgkin </em>(1892), 94 Mich 27 [53 NW 794]. At common law, sodomy covered only copulation <em>per anum. </em>\"Penetration <em>per os </em>did not constitute sodomy, or the 'crime against nature,\u2019 \u201d <em>People v Schmitt </em>(1936), 275 Mich 575, 577 [267 NW 741], and cases therein cited. The legislature has shown no inclination to depart from the common-law definition of sodomy. Penetration <em>per os, </em>fellatio, is prohibited by the gross indecency statute. <em>People v Schmitt, supra. </em>The elements of gross indecency and sodomy differ.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b837-7\">Greater detail was recounted in <em>People v Myers, </em>161 Mich App 215, 219-220; 409 NW2d 788 (1987), in which the Court held that the statute did not apply to the touching of another\u2019s genital area over clothing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b837-8\">[P]ost-Nexter appellate decisions that have construed the gross indecency statute at issue have arisen from a factual background in which fellatio occurred. . . . No cases were found in which another sexual act, i.e., the massage of fully covered male genitalia, has occurred.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b837-9\">[Prosecutions brought under other gross indecency statutes which also do not define an \"act of gross indecency,\u201d namely MCL 750.338a; MSA 28.570(1) (gross indecency between females) and MCL 750.338b; MSA 28.570(2) (gross indecency between a male and a female) have involved acts of fellatio or cunnilingus. <em>People v Livermore, </em>9 Mich App 47, 56-59; 155 NW2d 711 (1967) (sexual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>conduct between two females); <em>People v McCaleb, </em>37 Mich App 502; 195 NW2d 17 (1972), lv den 389 Mich 784 (1973) (fellatio); <em>People v Rea, </em>38 Mich App 141; 195 NW2d 809 (1972), lv den 388 Mich 795 (1972) (cunnilingus); <em>People v Roy Edwards, </em>58 Mich App 146; 227 NW2d 263 (1975), reversed in light of <em>People v Howell, supra, </em>396 Mich 825; 238 NW2d 536 (1976) (fellatio); <em>People v Towlen, </em>66 Mich App 577; 239 NW2d 668 (1976), lv den 397 Mich 831 (1976) (fellatio).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b838-5\">In each of the above cases (except <em>Livermore, </em>which did not involve a determination of whether, the sexual act committed constituted gross indecency), the trier of fact determined that the act was grossly indecent in light of community mores.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b838-6\">The only case from this Court to suggest that the gross indecency statutes proscribe \"unnatural\u201d acts other than fellatio and cunnilingus was <em>People v Howell, </em>396 Mich 16, 24; 238 NW2d 148 (1976). That case and its companion case, <em>People v Helzer </em>actually involved forced fellatio and fellatio with a minor, respectively. The Court held that the statute was not unconstitutionally vague as applied to the defendants because \"the statutes have long been applied in the courts of this state to acts of forced fellatio and fellatio with a minor.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 21. However, three justices would have adopted a definition of gross indecency that encompassed acts that had not been previously held to be \"acts of gross indecency\u201d: \"manual sexual acts committed without consent or with a person under the age of consent or any ultimate sexual act committed in public.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 24. Because the three other justices did not sign this section, it is not binding precedent.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> <em>Negri v Slotkin, </em>397 Mich 105, 109; 244 NW2d 98 (1976)._</p>\n<p id=\"b839-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>The dispute we now face was perpetuated as the Court of Appeals wrestled with the assertion in <em>Howell </em>that the offense of gross indecency encompassed acts that the \"common sense\u201d of society test would regard as indecent and improper. See 396 Mich 23. Some panels read <em>Dexter </em>as impermissibly endorsing a broad common sense of society test and held that the gross indecency statute did not apply to the act of touching a covered groin. See, e.g., <em>People v Emmerich, </em>175 Mich App 283; 437 NW2d 30 (1989). Others noted that the gross indecency statute had only been applied to cases involving oral sexual acts. See, e.g., <em>People v Myers, supra, </em>161 Mich App 221. Still others found in <em>Carey </em>and <em>Dexter </em>a broad common-sense test to find mutual masturbation in public a question \"left to the discretion of the jury,\u201d and thus chargeable as gross indecency. See, e.g., <em>People v Austin, </em>185 Mich App 334, 340; 460 NW2d 607 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b839-6\">ii</p>\n<p id=\"b839-7\">The separate opinion rejects the historical definition of the scope of the statute and asserts that gross indecency has historically been defined by the common sense of the community. Opinion of Levin, J., <em>ante </em>at 594-598. The author then rejects the common sense of the community test and holds that gross indecency includes masturbation in the presence of minors. Id. at 580, 594-598.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-8\">The suggestion that the scope of gross indecency as defined by this Court<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> was \"the common sense of the community\u201d is a straw man. That approach postulates that the requirement of indecency has not simply been <em>an </em>element of the statutory of<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>fense, but that it has been <em>the only </em>element, and that the offense has thus included any and all conduct that a jury thinks is indecent. Compare <em>supra, </em>p 608, n 8. The \"common sense of the community\u201d test finds no support in <em>Carey.</em><footnotemark><em>14</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The issue was not the scope of the offense, but the sufficiency of the information. The Court held that it was unnecessary to name the particular conduct involved, and that it was sufficient simply to track the language of the statute: \"The information in the language of the statute informed defendant of the crime for which he was to be tried. It should not state the evidence by which it is to be proved, nor should it describe the particular act charged. The gross indecency of the subject forbids it.\u201d 217 Mich 603. The Court cited the passage from <em>Hicks </em>about the test that applied in prosecutions for the distinct offenses of indecent liberties and indecent exposure, as well as the passage from <em>People v Girardin, 1 </em>Mich 90 (1848), concerning obscenity, merely to support the unremarkable proposition that the charging document need not state all details explicitly to be legally sufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-4\">Defining the offense of indecent liberties, as the Court did in <em>Hicks, </em>is a very different matter from defining gross indecency. It appears that the offense of indecent liberties, along with indecent exposure, was defined in terms of the \"common sense of the community.\u201d See, e.g., <em>People v Healy, </em>265 Mich 317, 319; 251 NW 393 (1933); <em>People v Visel, </em>275 Mich 77, 79; 265 NW 781 (1936); <em>People v Noyes, </em>328 Mich 207, 211; 433 NW2d 331 (1950) (quoting actual jury instructions). This was possible because the scope of the offense has built-in limitations. Indecent exposure, for example, is lim<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>ited to cases involving exposure\u2014a concept familiar to everyone. Though the term \"indecent liberties\u201d may be slightly more amorphous, it seems that it was commonly understood to encompass touching. With that understanding, it is easy to see how society shared, and probably continues to share, a common sense about what exposure or which liberties with children are \"indecent.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> In that sense, those terms need no further definition. Establishing \"common sense\u201d as the test only confirms this.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-6\">The opposite is true of \"gross indecency\u201d or \"the crime against nature.\u201d These terms are not definitions that limit the type of conduct to which a jury will apply its common-sense judgment. They are euphemisms for the conduct prohibited by them. \"Crime against nature\u201d is a euphemism for anal intercourse. As explained in Spence, <em>The law of crime against nature, </em>32 NC L R 312, 313 (1954), the first English statute on the subject, passed in 1533, prohibited as a felony the \"detestable and abominable vice of buggery committed with mankind or beast.\u201d Some American states, however, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>seem to have \"found the word 'buggery\u2019 too offensive to be seen in the code.\u201d <em>Id. </em>See also Perkins &amp; Boyce, Criminal Law (3d ed), p 465 (citing states \"which have used some such designation in lieu of a name\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b842-4\">The debate regarding the common sense of the community test in the context of gross indecency misfocuses the inquiry and obscures the precise issue in this case. That issue is what the term \"gross indecency\u201d is a euphemism for, and whether the statute encompasses the conduct of defendant Brashier. Gross indecency is a euphemism for fellatio and cunnilingus. As noted, the \"common sense of the community\u201d has not historically defined the scope of the gross indecency statutes. The holding of the Court in <em>Dexter, </em>6 Mich App 250, for example, as opposed to the dicta regarding common sense of the community, was that \"[pjenetration <em>per os, </em>fellatio, is prohibited by the gross indecency statute\u201d and that that offense and sodomy were distinct offenses. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b842-5\">The second flaw in the separate opinion is even more fundamental. Despite contrary protestations, the opinion adopts a broad view of the statute. There is no support in the almost one-hundred-year history of the statute for its application to sadomasochistic activity that involves no sexual contact between the victims and the perpetrators.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-6\">To state it differently, the separate opinion would \"overrule\u201d the broad interpretation of the statute, only to apply it broadly to conduct that is not even covered by the definition proposed by three justices in <em>Howell.</em><footnotemark><em>16</em></footnotemark><em> </em>In fact, the sadomaso<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>chistic abuse of Mr. Goike is conduct to which the statute has never been applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-4\">Faced with the unattractive prospect of finding Brashier\u2019s conduct outside the reach of the gross indecency statute, the problem is solved by four members of this Court saying that gross indecency is what Brashier did. The result contradicts the rationale of the separate opinion, and assumes authority we do not possess. No matter how reprehensible the alleged conduct, the power to create crimes and establish penalties rests exclusively with the Legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-5\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b843-6\">The common sense of the community does not define the conduct proscribed by the gross indecency statute. The statute covers only oral-genital contact that a jury finds in the circumstances is indecent. Because this conduct was not shown at the preliminary examination, it was error to bind over the defendant on this charge. I dissent, and would remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b843-7\">Brickley, J., concurred with Boyle, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b829-11\"> MCL 750.145c(2); MSA 28.342a(2), reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b829-12\">A person who persuades, induces, entices, coerces, causes, or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>knowingly allows a child to engage in a child sexually abusive activity for the purpose of producing any child sexually abusive material, or a person who arranges for, produces, makes, or finances, or a <em>person who attempts or prepares or conspires to arrange for, produce, make, or finance any child sexually abusive activity </em>or child sexually abusive material is guilty of a felony, punishable by imprisonment for not more than 20 years, or a fine of not more than $20,000, or both, if that person knows, has reason to know, or should reasonably be expected to know that the child is a child, or that person has not taken reasonable precautions to determine the age of the child.

The Court held that it was error:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b834-8\">The jury\u2019s function in this case as the trier of fact was to determine that (1) defendant had engaged in fellatio with a female, and (2) fellatio between a male and a female is conduct which the common sense of society regards as indecent and improper. The effect of the trial judge\u2019s charge was to eliminate the second element of the crime, \"whether the conduct was indecent,\u201d from the purview of the jury. <em>[Id. </em>at 507.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b834-9\">As the second sentence implies, the \"common sense test\u201d was a second element of the offense, limiting the scope of the statute to acts of fellatio that are found by a jury to be indecent:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b834-10\">In <em>[People v] Dexter </em>[6 Mich App 247; 148 NW2d 915 (1967)], we did not hold that as a matter of law fellatio is prohibited by the gross indecency statute. What this Court did in <em>Dexter </em>was affirm a jury\u2019s determination as trier of fact that the act of fellatio violated the gross indecency statute. Dictum from <em>People v Schmitt, </em>275 Mich 575, 577 (1936), was cited in <em>Dexter </em>at 250, for the proposition that \"fellatio is prohibited by the gross indecency statute.\u201d This statement, however, fails to tell us whether fellatio is prohibited as a matter of law or only upon jury determination. This statement in <em>Schmitt </em>relied on <em>People v Swift, </em>172 Mich 473 [138 NW 662] (1912), for its authoritative basis. <em>Swift, </em>however, was a jury case in which the trier of fact determined in the first instance that the gross indecency statute had been violated. It is to be noted that nowhere in <em>Swift </em>is fellatio mentioned as the type of conduct prohibited by the act. <em>Dexter </em>and <em>Schmitt, </em>resting as they do on <em>Swift, </em>thus fail to resolve the issue posed by the case at bar. <em>[Id. </em>at 505.]</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b835-7\"> In contrast, the statute proscribing \"the abominable and detestable crime against nature\u201d appears to date from Michigan\u2019s early years of statehood.

Under some circumstances a given act may be permissible, yet when that same act is accompanied by improper suggestions or proposals and occurs in surroundings such as .are here disclosed, it assumes a new aspect and becomes criminal in character. <em>[Id. </em>at 284.]</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b842-7\"> The definition proposed by three justices in <em>Howell, </em>396 Mich 24, would have prohibited \"oral and manual sexual acts committed without consent or with a person under the age of consent or any ultimate sexual act committed in public.\u201d Particularly in light of the final phrase that mentions \"any ultimate sexual act,\u201d the limitation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>of the offense to \"oral or manual sexual acts\u201d with minors seems rather definite.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-10\">The word \"with\u201d parallels language used in the Criminal Sexual Conduct statutes. The esc statutes require \"sexual penetration with another person,\u201d see, e.g, MCL 750.520b(l); MSA 28.788(2X1), or \"sexual contact with another person,\u201d MCL 750.520c(l); MSA 28.788(3)(1). These terms contemplate penetration into the genital or anal openings, and intentional touching of the intimate parts or clothing covering them, respectively. MCL 750.520a(k), (1); MSA 28.788(l)(k), (i). They do not suggest that the act criminalizes sexual intercourse or sexual contact in the presence of a minor.

Legislative intent is to be derived from the actual language of the statute, and when the language is clear and unambiguous, no further interpretation is necessary.\u201d <em>Storey v Meijer, Inc, </em>431 Mich 368, 376; 429 NW2d 169 (1988) (citations omitted). If judicial construction is necessary, the Court must discern the Legislature\u2019s intent by examining \"the object of the statute, the harm which it is designed to remedy, and apply a reasonable construction which best accomplishes the statute\u2019s purpose.\u201d <em>In re Forfeiture of $5,264, </em>432 Mich 242, 248; 439 NW2d 246 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b845-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>B</p>\n<p id=\"b845-4\">At issue in the instant case is the definition of \"gross indecency.\u201d While a majority rejects a definition formed by a common sense of the community, no majority definition emerges. Two justices<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> refuse to define the term. Justice Levin would define gross indecency under the <em>People v Howell</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark><em> </em>test and extend the scope of \"manual sexual act[s] . . . 'with a person under the age of consent\u2019 \u201d to include manual sexual acts, e.g., masturbation, in the presence of persons under the age of consent, even though this act was not done to or by persons under the age of consent. <em>Ante </em>at 580, n 4. Justice Boyle, joined by Justice Brickley, would limit gross indecency to oral-genital contact. I believe all three approaches are flawed. In fact, this Court has long held that the phrase gross indecency constitutes behavior offensive to the common sense of the community:<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b845-5\">\" 'Indecent and improper liberties with the person of such child\u2019 means such liberties as the common sense of society would regard as indecent and improper. In this case, as in <em>State v Millard, </em>18 Vt [571] 577 [1846], it may be said that 'no particular definition is given by the statute of what constitutes this crime. The indelicacy of the subject forbids it, and does not require of the court to state what particular conduct will constitute the offense. The common sense of the community, as well as the sense of decency, propriety, and morality which most people entertain, is sufficient to apply the statute to each particular case, and point out what particular conduct is rendered criminal by it.\u2019 \u201d <em>[People v Carey, </em>217 Mich 601, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>602-603; 187 NW 261 (1922), quoting <em>People v Hicks, </em>98 Mich 86, 90; 56 NW 1102 (1893).][<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b846-7\">Hence, contrary to the approach that refuses to define \"gross indecency,\u201d the approach adopting and extending <em>Howell, </em>and the approach limited to oral-genital contact, gross indecency is determined by reference to the common sense of the community, i.e., it is a question for the trier of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-8\">Certainly many gross indecency cases refer to or deal with oral sexual acts; however, no Michigan court has ever held that gross indecency is limited solely to such acts. Similarly, while this Court has held that sodomy does not constitute gross indecency, see, e.g., <em>People v Schmitt, </em>275 Mich 575; 267 NW 741 (1936), that finding has not limited the definition of gross indecency. In fact, we simply held that the crime of sodomy (then termed \" 'the abominable and detestable crime against nature\u2019 \u201d) did not include penetration per os,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> but did not hold that gross indecency included only penetration per os. <em>Id. </em>Likewise, the Court in <em>People v Dexter, </em>6 Mich App 247; 148 NW2d 915 (1967), held only that fellatio is prohibited by the gross indecency statute, not by the sodomy statute. The Court did not hold that gross indecency is limited simply to oral sexual acts. <em>Id. </em>at 250-251.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-9\">The purpose of the gross indecency act is to prohibit sexual conduct that is offensive to the community. \"The word 'indecent\u2019 is a common and general one. As ordinarily understood, it includes anything which is lewd or lascivious, obscene or grossly vulgar, unbecoming, unseemly, unfit to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>seen or heard, or which violates the proprieties of language or behavior.\u201d 50 Am Jur 2d, Lewdness, Indecency, and Obscenity, \u00a7 2, pp 451-452.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b847-4\">Statutes generally confer authority upon municipalities to preserve and protect the public morals, and to provide for the punishment of persons conducting themselves indecently in the streets and other public places, to the annoyance of the citizens. It has been observed that the decency which is protected by a statute is that which the predominant majority of minds agree upon. [Id. at 452.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b847-5\">Indeed, even the lead opinion in <em>People v Howell, </em>396 Mich 16; 238 NW2d 148 (1976), which would have redefined and narrowly construed the statute, would have encompassed more than merely oral sexual acts. It would have redefined gross indecency to include:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b847-6\">oral and manual sexual acts committed without consent or with a person under the age of consent or any ultimate sexual act committed in public. <em>[Howell, supra </em>at 24 (Levin, J.).][<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b847-7\">Thus, I agree with the memorandum opinion that the statute includes more than just oral-genital acts. The purpose and history of the statute reveal that while oral sexual conduct may constitute gross indecency, other acts may also violate the statute. However, unlike the memorandum opinion, I leave this latter determination to the trier of fact, i.e., whether gross indecency is con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>duct violative of the common sense of the community.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-5\">ii</p>\n<p id=\"b848-6\">Lino\u2019s conduct could very well be considered gross indecency by a jury. Under the <em>Carey </em>standard, a reasonable jury should be permitted to find that fellatio in a well-lit parking lot next to an open restaurant that is visible by the naked eye offends the common sense of society. Fellatio, as noted by the memorandum opinion, has long been deemed gross indecency by Michigan courts. See, e.g., <em>Howell, supra </em>at 22 (finding forced fellatio and fellatio performed on a nine-year-old boy gross indecency); <em>People v Myers, </em>161 Mich App 215, 220; 409 NW2d 787 (1987).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Indeed, even under the <em>Howell </em>standard, fellatio should be understood as an \"ultimate\u201d sex act. See, e.g., <em>Howell, supra </em>at 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-7\">Because Lino\u2019s actions constituted gross indecency, I join the memorandum opinion affirming his conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-8\">hi</p>\n<p id=\"b848-9\">Similarly, Brashier\u2019s conduct could be found by a jury to constitute gross indecency. Brashier on four separate occasions approached fourteen- or fifteen-year-old boys and offered them money if they would accompany him to \"beat up a queer.\u201d Brashier would approach the boys, feed them <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>lunch, and take them to a hotel where codefendant Goike would be waiting. Brashier would direct the boys to abuse Goike while Goike masturbated. The boys would, inter alia, hit Goike with a stick, urinate and vomit and pour syrup on him, and force him to eat combinations of these materials. Brashier mostly directed the behavior, but also would partake at times. At no time did either the boys or defendant engage in any sexual touching or acts. At the completion of these \"occasions,\u201d Brashier would pay the boys and threaten them with serious harm if they revealed what occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-4\">A jury certainly would be entitled to find that this behavior constituted gross indecency although it did not constitute oral sex. The common sense of the community is clearly offended by these acts. The exact purpose for enacting the gross indecency statute was to combat such aberrant behavior. The appropriateness of maintaining a purposefully vague statute is also clearly revealed by the circumstances of this case. No legislature can be expected to delineate with laser-like precision all possible offensive sexual predilections. Finding that this conduct could not constitute gross indecency simply would be inconsistent with the common law and the purpose of the statute at issue.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b849-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b849-6\">.
