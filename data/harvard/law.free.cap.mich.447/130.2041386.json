The student and his mother sued Wayne County on the theory that it was negligent because it failed to post school warning signs on that street. We hold that the trial court should have granted the defendant\u2019s motion for summary disposition on the ground of governmental immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-12\">i</p>\n<p id=\"b358-13\">This case arises out of an accident that occurred on June 10, 1987, at the intersection of Outer Drive and Mendota in the City of Detroit. The plaintiff, Anthony Mason, who was engaged in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>race with a friend, ran out into the street and struck the side of a car that had just run the red light at the intersection. He sustained a closed head or traumatic brain injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-4\">Anthony Mason and his mother sued numerous defendants. Count v of the plaintiffs\u2019 sixth amended complaint alleged that the City of Detroit, Wayne County, and their employees breached their duties pursuant to MCL 691.1402; MSA 3.996(102) to maintain the streets and the intersection in reasonable repair. The complaint alleged that the defendants failed to install stop signs, a pedestrian overhead walkway, a flashing red stoplight, school advance signs, school crossing signs, school speed limit signs, and school pavement markings.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">Before trial, the plaintiffs settled with the driver of the automobile. In addition, the court granted defendant City of Detroit\u2019s motion for summary disposition on the ground that the county had exclusive jurisdiction over the streets in question. Defendant Wayne County\u2019s motion for summary disposition on the basis of governmental immunity was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-6\">The plaintiffs proceeded to trial against both Wayne County and the crossing guard who was stationed at the intersection. The jury found in favor of the crossing guard, but against Wayne County and awarded the plaintiffs two million dollars in damages.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b359-7\">Both the plaintiffs and Wayne County appealed. The Court of Appeals resolved several issues, all in favor of the plaintiff. With respect to governmental immunity, the Court affirmed the trial court\u2019s ruling denying the county\u2019s motion for summary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>disposition. It reasoned that the duty to repair and maintain the highway \"includes the duty to post adequate traffic signage, including school signs, because they serve an integral part of the highway designed for vehicular travel.\u201d Unpublished opinion per curiam, issued June 11, 1992 (Docket No. 127003), slip op, p 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-6\">The county appealed, and we granted leave to appeal. 442 Mich 924 (1993).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b360-7\">ii</p>\n<p id=\"b360-8\">By statute, governmental agencies are immune from tort liability while engaging in a governmental function, except activities that fall within one of the narrowly drawn exceptions. See MCL 691.1407; MSA 3.996(107); <em>Ross v Consumers Power Co (On Rehearing.), </em>420 Mich 567, 618; 363 NW2d 641 (1984). This case involves the highway exception. See MCL 691.1402(1); MSA 3.996(102)(1).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b361-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>Defendant Wayne County argues that it cannot be liable under the highway exception for failing to install school warning signs because a school crossing is not a danger to vehicles and the vehicle passengers. We agree. The plaintiffs\u2019 action does not fall within the highway exception because a school does not present a special danger to vehicles. The highway exception abrogates governmental immunity except at \"points of special danger to motorists . . . .\u201d <em>Grof v Michigan, </em>126 Mich App 427, 434; 337 NW2d 345 (1983); <em>Comerica Bank of Kalamazoo v Dep\u2019t of Transportation, </em>168 Mich App 84, 86; 424 NW2d 2 (1987).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The plaintiffs\u2019 argument that prior decisions abrogate governmental immunity for all \"traffic control devices,\u201d which include signs, reads those decisions far too expansively. The cases cited by the plaintiff involve signs warning vehicular traffic as opposed to pedestrians.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-4\">The highway exception specifically excepts the state and counties from liability for defects in crosswalks, the defect alleged by the plaintiff: \"[t]he duty of the state and county road commissions to repair and maintain highways, and the liability therefor, shall extend only to the improved portion of the highway designed for vehicular travel and shall not include sidewalks, <em>crosswalks, </em>or any other installation outside of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>improved portion . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> That limiting sentence definitively excludes from the exception specific installations whose only rational purposes narrowly service the unique needs of pedestrians.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> As <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>we explained in <em>Roy v Dep\u2019t of Transportation, </em>428 Mich 330, 336; 408 NW2d 783 (1987), \"the exclusion of sidewalks, crosswalks, and other installations from the duty of maintenance and repair, reflects a [legislative] conclusion that pedestrians and users of these installations have been sufficiently protected by the separation of them from motorists, without any need to impose a duty of maintenance and repair enforced by liability for resultant injuries.\u201d The fact that liability under the statute does not extend to those using the excluded installations may seem harsh. However, the phrase \"designed for vehicular travel\u201d can only be reasonably interpreted to mean <em>\"intended </em>for vehicular travel.\u201d The explicit removal of exclusively pedestrian installations from the highway exception, coupled with the express language of the provision itself, permits but one conclusion: Pedestrians who trek upon Michigan highways must and do venture beyond the protective mandates of MCL 691.1402(1); MSA 3.996(102)(1).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b363-4\">The exclusion of crosswalks from the highway exception is consistent with the idea underlying the highway exception\u2014that drivers of vehicles should be able to keep their minds on the traffic, and should not have to worry that dangerous <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>surprises lie ahead. Pedestrians are situated differently than vehicular traffic, which may approach obstacles in the highway too quickly to avoid them, or may avoid obstacles only by jeopardizing traffic in the adjoining lanes.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-6\">This legislative line drawing is also explicable on the ground that expanding the right to sue past a certain point does not prevent accidents, and amounts to nothing more than an expanded obligation to pay.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The Legislature may well have concluded that governmental liability for injuries to pedestrians crossing the street will not enhance vehicular safety.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-7\">iii</p>\n<p id=\"b364-8\">For the foregoing reasons, we reverse the decision of the Court of Appeals and hold that the trial court erred when it denied the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss on the basis of governmental immunity. The case is remanded to the trial court with instructions to grant the defendant\u2019s motion for summary disposition on the ground of governmental immunity._</p>\n<judges id=\"b365-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>Brickley, Riley, and Griffin, JJ., concurred with Boyle, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b359-8\"> Much confusion surrounded the jury\u2019s verdict regarding the amount of damages.

[MCL 257.10; MSA 9.1810.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b362-9\">This Court assumes that the Legislature intended to give terms in the governmental immunity act the same meaning as they have in the Motor Vehicle Code. See <em>Roy v Dep\u2019t of Transportation, </em>428 Mich 330, 338-340; 408 NW2d 783 (1987). Other sources also define \"Crosswalk\u201d as \"a lane, usually marked, for pedestrians crossing a street or highway.\u201d See <em>The Random House College Dictionary. A </em>crosswalk should not be confused with a \"pedestrian overhead walkway.\u201d Cf. MCL 257.627a(3); MSA 9.2327(1)(3). Unless the word is to be read out of existence, governmental agencies do not owe a duty to pedestrians in crosswalks. Pedestrians crossing outside crosswalks face the additional hurdle of comparative negligence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b362-10\"> It appears that the purpose of this limiting sentence, which applies only to counties and the state, is to allocate responsibility for sidewalks and crosswalks to local governments, including townships, cities, and villages. This had been the arangement before 1964 (when the statute at issue was enacted). Compare 1948 CL 224.21:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-11\">It is hereby made the duty of the counties to keep in reasonable repair, so that they shall be reasonably safe and convenient for public travel, all county roads, bridges and culverts that are within their jurisdiction and under their care and control and which are open to public travel. The provisions of law respecting the liability of townships, cities, villages and corporations for damages for injuries resulting from a failure in the performance of the same duty respecting roads under their control, shall apply to counties adopting such county road system.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b362-12\">with 1948 CL 242.1:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-13\">Any person or persons sustaining bodily injury ... by reason of neglect to keep such public highways or streets, and all bridges, sidewalks, cross walks and culverts on the same in reasonable repair, and in condition reasonably safe and fit for travel by the township, village, city or corporation whose <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>corporate authority extends over such public highway, street, bridge, sidewalk, crosswalk or culvert, and whose duty it is to keep the same in reasonable repair ....</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b363-8\"> The State of Michigan pays for, and regulates the behavior of, school crossing guards. See MCL 257.613a to 257.613d; MSA 9.2313(1) to 9.2313(4). The highway exception does not place a tort duty on the government to protect other people who may need assistance. For example, the duty to protect toddlers from traffic lies with their caregivers. The duty to watch out for the visually impaired falls on drivers. The Penal Code requires them to take necessary precautions. See MCL 752.52(1); MSA 28.770(2)(1). \"A driver of a vehicle shall not approach a crosswalk ... or any other pedestrian crossing without taking all necessary precautions to avoid accident or injury to a blind pedestrian carrying a cane or using a dog guide.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b364-9\"> Professor Priest has explained why expanding liability does not always increase safety:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b364-10\">Some courts and agencies appear to believe that increasing the obligation of providers to compensate victims will always increase these providers\u2019 investments in safety. Where damage measures are compensatory, however, there is a very definite ceiling to the accident prevention investments that any provider will make. Providers will make investments to reduce the accident rate only to the extent that such investments are cost-effective\u2014that is, that the marginal costs of preventive investments are less than the marginal gain in expected accident cost reduction. Beyond that point, it is less costly to pay damage claims or judgments than to prevent accidents from occurring. Thus, extending liability beyond that point will not affect the level of safety investments.

The argument is made by defendant that whether or not street light poles are required to be maintained in repair by that statute, the duty to do so does not extend to anyone except travelers and, since at the time of injury plaintiff was not traveling upon the adjoining street, defendant\u2019s statutory duty did not extend to him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b367-6\">We disagree. <em>The reference to public </em>travel[<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>] <em>contained in the statute quoted above is not a restriction upon the persons to whom the duty is owed but, rather, de\u00f1nes the standard by which the duty is measured: </em>\"to keep in reasonable repair, so that they shall be reasonably safe and convenient for public travel.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b368-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number><em>Liability is imposed upon municipalities in favor of \"any person or persons\u201d injured by reason of the municipality\u2019s breach of its statutory duty.

To the extent that there is any inference in that case inconsistent with this opinion, it is expressly overruled. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b368-6\">Although the fourth sentence of the highway exception<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> provides that the county is not obliged to repair and maintain crosswalks or sidewalks, it does not follow that the fourth sentence relieves counties from liability for failure to keep the roadway \"in condition reasonably safe and fit for travel\u201d for all travelers, including pedestrians. \"The defect alleged by the plaintiff\u201d is not a defect in crosswalks,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> but rather a failure of the county to discharge its obligation to keep the roadway \"in condition reasonably safe and fit for travel\u201d by a child on his way to school.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-7\">The fourth sentence imposes on cities and townships the duty to keep crosswalks and sidewalks \"in condition reasonably safe and fit for travel.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>The fourth sentence does not thereby relieve the state or the county of its obligation under the first and second sentences to keep the roadway \"in condition reasonably safe, and fit for travel.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b369-4\">Cities and townships are obliged under the first, second, and fourth sentences of the highway exception to provide signs and traffic signals reasonably necessary for pedestrian travel on city and township roads, sidewalks, and crosswalks, and also on sidewalks and crosswalks of state and county roads. But the state and the county have the obligation under the first and second sentences to provide signs and traffic signals respecting use of the highway reasonably necessary for the protection of motorists, their passengers, and other travelers, including pedestrians.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">The majority errs in stating, as a matter of law, that \"a school does not present a special danger to vehicles,\u201d and that \"a school crossing is not a danger to vehicles and the vehicle passengers.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> School advance signs, school crossing signs, school speed limit signs, school pavement markings, overhead walkways, and flashing red stoplights are installed at schools for the protection of motorists and their passengers, as well as for the protection of school children, to guard against the risk of collisions resulting from diversion of vehicles from the line of travel to avoid hitting a child.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-6\">Outer Drive at this school crossing is a busy thoroughfare. Outer Drive is a boulevard for approximately a mile preceding the east boundary of the school, and for approximately a mile preceding the west boundary of the school.

The speed limit is thirty-five miles an hour, but actual speeds exceed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>forty-five miles an hour. The need for special precautions is apparent. Minimally, the county could have stenciled across the roadway \"school\u201d in each lane of travel\u2014a precaution seen throughout the metropolitan area.' Such a school advance warning would not be an \"other installation outside of the improved portion of the highway designed for vehicular travel\u201d under the fourth sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">As the Great Depression was about to descend on this nation, this Court observed that a highway authority \"cannot confine its citizens in a traffic groove. It must take into account the natural inclination of children to run about in play and the perverse insistence of adults to cut corners and cross streets and grass plats instead of following precisely the beaten or provided path. Such departure from the sidewalk is not negligence <em>per se </em>in the individual, nor does it relieve the city of the duty to keep its streets in proper condition for travel at the places where people may reasonably be expected probably to walk. <em>Lincoln v City of Detroit </em>[101 Mich 245; 59 NW 617 (1894)];[<footnotemark>8</footnotemark>] <em>Baker v City of Grand Rapids, </em>111 Mich 447 [69 NW 740 (1897)]; <em>Finch v Village of Bangor, </em>133 Mich 149 [94 NW 738 (1903)].
