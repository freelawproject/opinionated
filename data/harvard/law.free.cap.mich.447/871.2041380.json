The Court of Appeals reversed and awarded physical custody to the defendant. Because it did not correctly review this matter, we reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals insofar as it relates to the standards of review applicable to child custody cases, and remand to circuit court for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b1100-11\">I. FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b1100-12\">The parties were married in 1975 and have three children. The plaintiff filed for divorce in 1990. Following extended hearings incident to the divorce proceeding, a referee recommended that physical custody of the children be awarded to the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b1101-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"875\">*875</page-number>The referee reached this conclusion after reviewing the statutory factors for determining the best interests of the children. See MCL 722.23; MSA 25.312(3). <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Although the referee found that most of the factors were of neutral weight, he did find that factors b and c weighed slightly in favor of the defendant and factor f weighed slightly in favor of the plaintiff. The referee also indicated that he considered what the children had told him during private and separate interviews.</p>\n<p id=\"b1101-4\">At the request of the plaintiff, the circuit court held a de novo hearing. After hearing the testi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"876\">*876</page-number>mony of the parties, reviewing the evidentiary record made before the referee, and interviewing the two older children, the circuit court granted physical custody to the plaintiff. Although the circuit court judge found that most of the statutory factors were of neutral weight, he found that factors b, e, and f weighed slightly in favor of the plaintiff. The circuit court issued a December 6, 1991, custody order granting physical custody to the plaintiff and awarding the defendant liberal visitation rights, as well as joint legal custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b1102-6\">The defendant appealed, and the Court of Appeals reversed the custody determination, concluding that the circuit court had made clearly erroneous findings of fact with regard to factor f and had committed clear legal errors concerning factors b, e, and f. 200 Mich App 505; 504 NW2d 684 (1993). Without discussing the remaining factors, the Court of Appeals further stated that upon de novo review it found the parties to be equal on all the statutory factors except factor i, which relates to the child\u2019s reasonable preference. On the basis of that factor, the Court of Appeals awarded custody to the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b1102-7\">The plaintiff appealed to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1102-8\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b1102-9\">We are asked to clarify the proper standard of review in child custody cases. We conclude that such cases are to be reviewed in accordance with \u00a7 8 of the Child Custody Act, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1102-10\">To expedite the resolution of a child custody dispute by prompt and final adjudication, all orders and judgments of the circuit court shall be affirmed on appeal unless the trial judge made findings of fact against the great weight of evidence or committed a palpable abuse of discretion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"877\">*877</page-number>or a clear legal error on a major issue. [MCL 722.28; MSA 25.312(8).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1103-6\">By its terms, \u00a7 8 distinguishes among three types of findings and assigns standards of review to each. Findings of fact are to be reviewed under the \"great weight\u201d standard, discretionary rulings are to be reviewed for \"abuse of discretion,\u201d and questions of law for \"clear legal error.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1103-7\">As noted by the Court of Appeals, the review standards of the Child Custody Act differ from the standards that this Court has applied in alimony disputes and property disputes incident , to divorce. However, unlike the Court of Appeals, we do not attempt to import or superimpose the standards applicable to property and alimony disputes into the legislatively prescribed standards applicable to custody disputes. We believe that the difference in standards comports with the fact that the interests at stake in a child custody dispute differ from those involved in a dispute over money or property.</p>\n<p id=\"b1103-8\">The three standards of review enumerated in \u00a7 8 of the custody act are part of the Legislature\u2019s comprehensive effort to promote the best interests and welfare of children. By incorporating standards of review into the act, the Legislature apparently recognized that in custody cases the proceedings themselves may jeopardize a child\u2019s welfare. Because we believe that standards set forth in \u00a7 8 reasonably minimize the possibility of unwarranted and disruptive changes in custody, while at the same time enabling courts to pursue suitable custody arrangements, we adopt those standards as explained more fully herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b1103-9\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b1103-10\">The Child Custody Act provides that findings of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"878\">*878</page-number>fact in child custody cases are reviewed under the \"great weight of evidence\u201d standard. MCL 722.28; MSA 25.312(8). When the Legislature enacted the custody act it presumably used the phrase, \"against the great weight of evidence,\u201d with knowledge of its existing meaning and with intent that the phrase maintain its existing meaning. <em>In re Chamberlain Estate, </em>298 Mich 278, 284; 299 NW 82 (1941). \"Against the great weight of evidence\u201d was defined by <em>Murchie v Standard Oil Co, </em>355 Mich 550, 558; 94 NW2d 799 (1959). The Court explained that a reviewing court should not substitute its judgment on questions of fact unless they \" 'clearly preponderate in the opposite direction.\u2019 \u201d The court should review \"the record in order to determine whether the verdict is so contrary to the great weight of the evidence as to disclose an unwarranted finding, or whether the verdict is so plainly a miscarriage of justice as to call for a new trial . . . .\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1104-6\">Although the great weight standard traditionally is applied in the context of granting and denying new trials, the Legislature\u2019s adoption of that standard for appellate review of child custody orders reasonably furthers its express intent to: \"expedite the resolution of a child custody dispute by prompt and <em>\u00f1nal </em>adjudication . . . .\u201d MCL 722.28; MSA 25.312(8). In custody trials, the trial judge is the finder of fact. Thus, when an appellate court reviews a trial judge\u2019s findings, it acts as the functional equivalent of a trial judge reviewing the findings of a jury. Therefore, the great weight standard, which is the standard by which jury findings are reviewed, is also a logical standard by which to review findings of a trial judge. The great weight standard of review allows a meaningful yet deferential review by the Court of Appeals. A more deferential standard, such as \"insufficient <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"879\">*879</page-number>evidence\u201d or \"supported by competent, material, and substantial evidence,\u201d could effectively immunize the trial judge\u2019s fact finding in contravention of a child\u2019s best interests.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1105-6\">In the context of child custody cases, there are findings of ultimate facts, i.e., a finding regarding each factor, and there are findings of ordinary or evidentiary facts. The great weight of the evidence standard applies to all findings of fact. Thus, a trial court\u2019s findings on each factor should be affirmed unless the evidence \" 'clearly preponderate^] in the opposite direction.\u2019 \u201d <em>Murchie, supra </em>at 558.</p>\n<p id=\"b1105-7\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b1105-8\">Under the Child Custody Act, discretionary rulings are reviewed under a \"palpable' abus\u00e9 of discretion\u201d standard. MCL 722.28; MSA 25.312(8). Abuse of discretion was defined in <em>Spalding v Spalding, </em>355 Mich 382, 384-385; 94 NW2d 810 (1959), as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1105-9\">Where, as here, the exercise of discretion turns upon a factual determination made by the trier of the facts, an abuse of discretion involves far more than a difference in judicial opinion between the trial and appellate courts. ... In order to have an \"abuse\u201d in reaching such determination, the result must be so palpably and grossly violative of fact and logic that it evidences not the exercise of will <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"880\">*880</page-number>but perversity of will, not the exercise of judgment but defiance thereof, not the exercise of reason but rather of passion or bias.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1106-6\">Although defendant and amici curiae have suggested that this Court abandon the <em>Spalding </em>definition, at least in the context of custody disputes, the disposition of this case does not require such an outright rejection.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> By using the word \"palpable,\u201d the Legislature clearly contemplated a strict standard of review. Nevertheless, we do not agree with plaintiff that the Legislature\u2019s use of the word \"palpable\u201d should be construed as requiring an even stricter standard than Spalding\u2014in essence, plaintiff proposes: palpability <em>plus Spalding. </em>A standard stricter than <em>Spalding, </em>as suggested by plaintiff, would effectively grant trial courts unfettered discretion over child custody matters and potentially jeopardize a child\u2019s best interests. Because we construe statut\u00e9s in harmony with the spirit and intent of the act and in a manner that does not achieve absurd or unreasonable results, <em>In re State Hwy Comm, </em>383 Mich 709, 714-715; 178 NW2d 923 (1970), we instead conclude that the Legislature\u2019s reference to \"palpable,\u201d the same word this Court used in <em>Spalding, </em>manifests its intent to adopt a high standard of review not significantly unlike the <em>Spalding </em>standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b1106-7\">To whom custody is granted is a discretionary dispositional ruling. <em>Cooley v Cooley, </em>329 Mich 91, 95; 44 NW2d 884 (1950). Therefore, a custody award should be affirmed unless it represents an abuse of discretion. While the abuse of discretion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"881\">*881</page-number>standard is strict, it does not afford trial courts unfettered discretion in awarding custody. The court\u2019s exercise of that discretion is already limited by the statutory best interest factors, MCL 722.23; MSA 25.312(3), each of which must be carefully evaluated by the trial judge. <em>Wolfe v Howatt, </em>119 Mich App 109; 326 NW2d 442 (1982). Further, as noted above, a court\u2019s ultimate finding regarding a particular factor is a factual finding that can be set aside if it is against the great weight of the evidence. Therefore, a court\u2019s discretion in weighing the evidence regarding a particular factor is not unlimited; rather, it must be supported by the weight of the evidence.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> See <em>Baker v Baker, </em>411 Mich 567, 584-585; 309 NW2d 532 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b1107-6\">c</p>\n<p id=\"b1107-7\">Lastly, the custody act provides that questions of law are reviewed for \"clear legal error.\u201d MCL 722.28; MSA 25.312(8). Because we are unable to discern any substantial distinction between \"clear legal error\u201d and ordinary \"legal error\u201d we regard the word \"clear\u201d as a legislative caution against result-oriented jurisprudence that might operate to the detriment of a child\u2019s interest in maintaining a stable custodial environment. When a court incorrectly chooses, interprets, or applies the law, it commits legal error that the appellate court is bound to correct.</p>\n<p id=\"AF-\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"882\">*882</page-number>D</p>\n<p id=\"b1108-5\">To alleviate any confusion that prior decisions of this Court may well have engendered, we expressly recognize that the standards of review described in this section preclude de novo review of custody cases by appellate courts. In the context of appellate review, a truly de novo review would be a review of the record without deference to prior proceedings; on the basis of the record, the appellate court would make its own findings of fact and conclusions of law.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Although, courts have recited that review of custody cases is \"de novo limited by the statute,\u201d they have not actually accorded a truly de novo review. See <em>Baker, supra. </em>Indeed, the extent to which the statutory standards \"limit\u201d de novo review is tantamount to abolishing de novo review. Today, we recognize as much by holding that review of custody orders is not de novo.</p>\n<p id=\"b1108-6\">in</p>\n<p id=\"b1108-7\">Having considered the proper standards of review in custody cases, we next turn to the Court of Appeals opinion. The Court held that the trial court committed clear legal error with regard to factors b, e, and f. As explained below, we agree with the Court of Appeals finding of legal error with respect to factors e and f, but we do not find error in the trial court\u2019s analysis of factor b. Further, in accord with <em>Dempsy v Dempsy, </em>409 Mich 495; 296 NW2d 813 (1980), we hold that upon a finding of error, appellate courts should remand to the trial court unless the error was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"Afq\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"883\">*883</page-number>A</p>\n<p id=\"b1109-3\">The Court of Appeals held that it was clear legal error for the trial judge to provide only a one-sided account of the facts when considering factor b. We disagree. While we believe that the most effective appellate review obviously would result from a more thorough account of the court\u2019s balancing, we disagree with the Court of Appeals finding of clear legal error on this issue. The trial court\u2019s findings in this case minimally satisfy the requirements of the court rules and case law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1109-4\">MCR 2.517, which governs findings of fact by the trial court, provides in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1109-5\">(A) Requirements.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1109-6\">(1) In actions tried on the facts without a jury or with an advisory jury, the court shall find the facts specially, state separately its conclusions of law, and direct entry of the appropriate judgment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1109-7\">(2) <em>Brief, de\u00f1nite, </em>and <em>pertinent </em>findings and conclusions on the contested matters are sufficient, <em>without over elaboration of detail or particularization of facts. </em>[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1109-8\">In the context of custody cases, this Court has refused to interpret this rule as requiring a recitation of all the evidence considered. In <em>Baker, supra </em>at 583, the Court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1109-9\">Neither the mandate of the Child Custody Act nor our requirement that in non-jury cases the \"court shall find the facts specially and state separately its conclusions of law thereon\u201d requires in cases involving child custody decisions that the court comment upon every matter in evidence or declare acceptance or rejection of every proposition argued.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1109-10\">The <em>Baker </em>Court explained that the trial court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"884\">*884</page-number>failure to address the myriad facts pertaining to a factor does not suggest that the relevant among them were overlooked. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1110-6\">In the instant case, the factors not <em>discussed </em>by the trial court in ruling on factor b were: the defendant\u2019s involvement in the academic affairs and extracurricular activities of the children and the children\u2019s reliance on the defendant to answer questions about sexual maturation. The record does not suggest that those relevant facts were overlooked by the court. Instead, because the court only found \"some\u201d diff\u00e9rence between the parents, rather than a \"significant\u201d or \"substantial\u201d difference, it would seem that the court did consider those facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b1110-7\">Because the trial court complied with the court rules and case law, the \"one-sided account\u201d is not \"clear legal error.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1110-8\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b1110-9\">Factor e requires the trial court to consider \"[t]he permanence, as a family unit, of the existing or proposed custodial home or homes.\u201d MCL 722.23(e); MSA 25.312(3)(e). In the instant case, the trial court focused on the <em>\"acceptability </em>of the custodial home,\u201d as opposed to its permanence. It stated its finding as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1110-10\">The Court is satisfied that either parent would provide permanence, as a family unit, and would offer acceptable custodial homes. It is undisputed that plaintiff as a father is accustomed to and willing to preform [sic] the day to day jobs to maintain a household. The Court feels that some weight should be assigned in favor of plaintiff because the evidence shows that defendant had been out of the home in the evening many times and thus not caring for the family while plaintiff has been present on those occasions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1111-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"885\">*885</page-number>Because acceptability of the home is not pertinent to factor e, the panel found that it was legal error for the trial court to consider it. We agree with the Court of Appeals. The facts relied upon and expressed by the judge relate to acceptability, rather than permanence, of the custodial unit. Therefore, the trial court\u2019s error seems to go beyond mere word choice.</p>\n<p id=\"b1111-6\">c</p>\n<p id=\"b1111-7\">Standing alone, the trial court\u2019s error on factor e might be deemed harmless; however, we also agree with the Court of Appeals that there was legal error in the trial court\u2019s evaluation of factor f, which requires the court to consider the parties\u2019 \"moral fitness.\u201d MCL 722.23; MSA 25.312(3). The trial court found this factor favored the plaintiff and supported its conclusion with the fact that the defendant had engaged in extramarital affairs. It stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1111-8\">The Court is of the opinion that the moral fitness factor favors plaintiff under the circumstances. Defendant does not dispute that she engaged in extra-marital affairs during the past few years. The Court is of the opinion that this demonstrates a poor moral example for the children and thus finds this factor in favor of plaintiff.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1111-9\">In finding that the trial court committed clear legal error in its analysis of f\u00e1ctor f, the Court of Appeals explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1111-10\">Although the record reveals that defendant did not admit that she had engaged in extramarital affairs, defendant apparently admitted one affair during the friend of the court hearings and there was some evidence of another. Even assuming that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"886\">*886</page-number>there was evidence supporting the existence of two extramarital affairs, the evidence was clear that the children had no knowledge of them. Given that the children had no knowledge of defendant\u2019s affairs, there was no reason for finding that defendant\u2019s affairs established a poor moral example for the children. Under the circumstances, the affairs could establish a poor moral example only if the children knew about them. Because there were no findings of fact demonstrating a poor moral example for the children, there was no reason for finding this factor in favor of plaintiff.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1112-6\">Moreover, the trial court\u2019s conclusion that defendant\u2019s affairs demonstrated a poor moral example for the children evinced a clear legal error on a major issue. In <em>Truitt [v Truitt, 172 </em>Mich App 38, 46; 431 NW2d 454 (1988)], this Court stated that \"[standing alone, unmarried cohabitation is not enough to constitute immorality under the Child Custody Act.\u201d Previously, a panel of this Court also observed that a mother\u2019s acts of adultery do not necessarily preclude her from having custody of her children. <em>Williamson v Williamson, </em>122 Mich App 667, 673; 333 NW2d 6 (1982). Even if defendant engaged in extramarital affairs, this finding, standing alone, is not sufficient to support the trial court\u2019s conclusion that defendant behaved immorally. This finding is a clear legal error that requires reversal. [200 Mich App 514-515.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1112-7\">Thus, the Court of Appeals concluded that extramarital conduct of the plaintiff, which was unknown to the children, did not, as a matter of law, bear on the defendant\u2019s moral fitness. While, for reasons explained below, we agree with the Court of Appeals, we also note that by focusing exclusively on the parent\u2019s \"moral example\u201d the Court of Appeals, like the trial court, overlooked the critical words in factor f: \"fitness of the parties involved.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1112-8\">Factor f (moral fitness), like all the other statu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"887\">*887</page-number>tory factors, relates to a person\u2019s fitness <em>as a parent. </em>To evaluate parental fitness, courts must look to the parent-child relationship and the effect that the conduct at issue will have on that relationship. Thus, the question under factor f is <em>not </em>\"who is the morally superior adult\u201d; the question concerns the parties\u2019 relative fitness to provide for their child, given the moral disposition of each party as demonstrated by individual conduct. We hold that in making that finding, questionable conduct is relevant to factor f only if it is a type of conduct that necessarily has a significant influence on how one will function <em>as a parent.</em><footnotemark><em>6</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1113-6\">Extramarital relations are not necessarily a reliable indicator of how one will function within the parent-child relationship.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> While such conduct certainly has a bearing on one\u2019s spousal fitness, it need not be probative of how one will interact with or raise a child. Because of its limited probative value and the significant potential for prejudicially ascribing disproportionate weight to that fact, extramarital conduct, in and of itself, may not be relevant to factor f. To the extent that one\u2019s marital misconduct actually does have an identifiable adverse effect on a particular person\u2019s ability or disposition to raise a child, those parental shortcomings often may be reflected in other relevant statutory factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b1113-7\">Unfortunately, extramarital relations are not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"888\">*888</page-number>uncommon incidents in divorces. Indeed, they are often the impetus for a marital breakdown. We do not take lightly the moral or destructive consequences of extramarital conduct on a marriage. Nonetheless, to punish infidelity at the risk of jeopardizing a child\u2019s best interests simply contravenes the overriding purpose of the Child Custody Act. Accordingly, we agree with the Court of Appeals to the extent that it found that the trial court committed legal error when considering the extramarital conduct under factor f.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1114-6\">iv</p>\n<p id=\"b1114-7\">Finally, we address the proper disposition of custody cases following appellate review. In its strained effort to reconcile de novo review with the otherwise deferential standards of review in custody cases, the Court of Appeals concluded that upon finding error, it was required to engage in a de novo review to determine the proper custody arrangement.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1114-8\">[W]e conclude that this Court may review de novo the dispositional ruling of a trial court, but only after we have concluded, as we do here, that the trial court has either made findings of fact against the great weight of the evidence or committed a palpable abuse of discretion or a clear legal error on a major issue. In this case, the trial court committed the first and third of these prohibitions and we are, therefore, free to review de novo the custody issue. [200 Mich App 522.][<footnotemark>9</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1115-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"889\">*889</page-number>We decline to adopt the dispositional framework offered by the Court of Appeals. De novo review of the ultimate custodial disposition is inappropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b1115-6\">In accord with <em>Dempsy, supra, </em>upon a finding of error an appellate court should remand the case for reevaluation, unless the error was harmless. We further hold that on remand, the court should consider up-to-date information, including the children\u2019s current and reasonable preferences, as well as the fact that the children have been living with the plaintiff during the appeal and any other changes in circumstances arising since the. trial court\u2019s original custody order.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1115-7\">We are aware that an appellate court\u2019s peremptory change of custody would be more expeditious than remanding to the trial court. However, we do not believe that the Legislature\u2019s express intent to expedite proceedings was to take precedence over the primary goal of the Child Custody Act, which is to secure custody decisions that are in the best interests of the child. The state\u2019s interest in child protection cannot be reduced merely to providing expedient proceedings. As amici curiae have pointed out: \"It is a false efficiency to put 'expediency\u2019 over accuracy.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1115-8\">Our disposition of this case recognizes that trial courts are in a superior position to make accurate decisions concerning the custody arrangement that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"890\">*890</page-number>will be in a child\u2019s best interests. Although not infallible, trial courts are more experienced and better situated to weigh evidence and assess credibility.

While such conduct certainly has a bearing on one\u2019s spousal fitness, it need not be probative of how one will interact with or raise a child. Because of its limited probative value and the significant potential for prejudicially ascribing disproportionate weight to that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"901\">*901</page-number>fact, extramarital conduct, in and of itself, may not be relevant to factor f.[<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1127-4\">The holding of the lead opinion with respect to factor f amounts to a usurpation of legislative authority. Inclusion of factor f in the Child Custody Act reflects a decision by the Legislature that <em>moral </em>fitness <em>is </em>relevant to the \"best interests of the child\u201d determination. Since extramarital conduct is probative of moral fitness, such conduct merits consideration in custody decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1127-5\">While the statute divides parental fitness into various aspects, there is no similar subdivision of moral fitness into what is relevant to parental fitness and what is not. All actions bearing on one\u2019s moral fitness necessarily become relevant to one\u2019s parental fitness by virtue of factor f. While disagreement may exist over the nexus between moral fitness and parental fitness,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> arguments of this type are more appropriately addressed to the Legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b1127-6\">I do not suggest that extramarital conduct should be dispositive. As expressed by the Court of Appeals in <em>Feldman v Feldman, </em>55 Mich App 147, 151; 222 NW2d 2 (1974):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1127-7\">[M]oral fitness of the competing parties is only one of ten factors which the court considers in child custody disputes.
