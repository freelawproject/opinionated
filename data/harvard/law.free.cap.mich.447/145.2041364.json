The Court of Appeals relied upon our plurality opinion in <em>Scheurman v Dep\u2019t of Transportation, </em>434 Mich 619; 456 NW2d 66 (1990), to reverse the Court of Claims denial of defendant\u2019s motion for summary disposition. While we agree with the result reached by the Court of Appeals, we do not fully endorse its rationale. 198 Mich <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>App 728; 499 NW2d 29 (1993). We hold that because the abutment and guardrail are neither part of \"the improved portion of the highway designed for vehicular travel,\u201d nor installations integrally and directly affecting safe vehicular travel upon the improved portion, governmental immunity bars the cause of action set forth in plaintiff\u2019s complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-6\">i</p>\n<p id=\"b378-7\">Plaintiff was injured when his motorcycle left the roadway of a highway entrance ramp and overpass, crossed the shoulder, and struck either a metal guardrail or concrete abutment<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> immediately adjacent to, but beyond, the shoulder. Plaintiff was thrown over the bridge railing and landed next to a median barrier on the highway below, incurring a number of injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-8\">Plaintiff filed suit in the Court of Claims, alleging that the entrance ramp was owned by the state and under the jurisdiction and control of defendant who, plaintiff maintained, had responsibility for the design, construction, and maintenance of those bridge railings on the entrance ramp. Plaintiff\u2019s complaint specifically alleged that defendant had failed to properly design and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>construct the bridge railing, failed to inspect the entrance ramp for dangerous conditions, and failed to provide adequate warnings of dangers on the entrance ramp. The complaint further alleged that these negligent acts and omissions were the direct and proximate cause of plaintiff\u2019s injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">Defendant moved for summary disposition and, relying upon our decision in <em>Scheurman, supra, </em>argued that because of governmental immunity it was under no duty to maintain bridge railings \"which fall outside the traveled and paved portion of the roadbed actually designed for public vehicular travel.\u201d The Court of Claims denied summary disposition, concluding that guardrails are \"designed to affect the way vehicles travel down the road.\u201d Invoking stare decisis and explaining that it was bound to \"follow\u201d our holding in <em>Scheurman, </em>the Court of Appeals reversed in a per curiam opinion.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Specifically, the Court of Appeals concluded that because the bridge railing \"was neither 'roadbed\u2019 nor 'designed for vehicular travel,\u2019 governmental immunity applies and defendant should not be held liable for plaintiff\u2019s injuries\u201d (citing Scheurman).</p>\n<p id=\"b379-6\">ii</p>\n<p id=\"b379-7\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b379-8\">As a general rule, governmental agencies are immune from tort liability for actions taken in furtherance of a governmental function. MCL 691.1407; MSA 3.996(107). The Legislature has articulated limited exceptions to this general rule, including the highway exception, which mandates <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>that a governmental agency having jurisdiction over any highway</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-4\">shall maintain the highway in reasonable repair so that it is reasonably safe and convenient for public travel. [MCL 691.1402(1); MSA 3.996(102X1).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">Notably, for activities undertaken to fulfill this mandate, both the government\u2019s duty and its liability are limited to that \"improved portion of the highway designed for vehicular travel.\u201d It is this limiting language which we interpret and apply in the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-6\">As this Court explained in <em>Ross v Consumers Power (On Rehearing), </em>420 Mich 567; 363 NW2d 641 (1984), the statutory grant of governmental immunity is broad, and its exceptions are narrowly drawn. We are mindful, however, that like all judicial interpretations of statutory provisions, this Court is bound by the well-established rule that our primary goal is to give effect to the controlling intent of the Legislature. <em>Lorencz v Ford Motor Co, </em>439 Mich 370; 483 NW2d 844 (1992). Accordingly, while we address our efforts in the shadow of a narrowly drawn statutory exception, our analysis inextricably proceeds toward the light of legislative intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-7\">The legislative purpose for the highway exception is, we believe, a clear one: to enhance the safety of public travel upon state-owned highways. This interpretation of the highway exception was first articulated in <em>Roy v Dep\u2019t of Transportation, </em>428 Mich 330, 341; 408 NW2d 783 (1987), and was most recently reaffirmed in <em>Gregg v Dep\u2019t of State Hwys, </em>435 Mich 307, 316; 458 NW2d 619 (1990). We expressly reiterate and adopt it today.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-8\">As was first explained in <em>Roy, </em>the legislative purpose underlying the highway exception is ful<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>filled by requiring certain governmental agencies to \"repair and maintain the highway so that the improved portion designed for vehicular travel is reasonably safe and convenient for public travel.\u201d <em>Roy, supra </em>at 341. Although this duty to \"repair and maintain\u201d is a limited one\u2014extending only to that \"improved portion of the highway designed for vehicular travel\u201d\u2014within this conceptual boundary the statutory goal of maintaining safe highways is clear and unambiguous. Because we are obligated to give effect to the controlling legislative intent of this exception, it. is against the backdrop of this statutory purpose that we today interpret and apply the limiting language of MCL 691.1402; MSA 3.996(102).</p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b381-6\">1. <em>ROY v dep\u2019t OF TRANSPORTATION</em></p>\n<p id=\"b381-7\">The highway exception, and its limiting language, was first examined by this Court in <em>Roy. </em>There we held that a bicycle path adjacent to, but separate and detached from, a highway was not part of the improved portion of that highway designed for vehicular travel. <em>Id. </em>at 340. In reaching this conclusion, we focused primarily on the <em>location </em>of the allegedly defective installation. Specifically, we explained that \"the [highway exception] does not offer general protection to pedestrians or motorists without regard to <em>location,\u201d </em>and that \"[t]he criterion used by the Legislature was not based on the class of travelers, <em>but the road on which they travel.\u201d Id. </em>at 341 (emphasis added). Because the bicycle path in <em>Roy </em>was located beyond the improved portion designed for vehicular travel, we concluded that governmental immunity from suit was not abrogated by the highway exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>2. <em>SCHEURMAN v DEP\u2019t OF TRANSPORTATION</em></p>\n<p id=\"b382-4\">The location of allegedly defective installations was again emphasized by this Court in <em>Scheurman. </em>There we held that the failure to install lighting along a state trunk line did not subject the government to potential liability because \"the physical structure of the lights falls outside the traveled or paved portion of the roadbed actually designed for public vehicular travel.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 633.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Notably, while four justices in <em>Scheurman </em>joined in the rationale and result of the lead opinion, only three justices expressly subscribed to its holding that the limiting language of MCL 691.1402; MSA 3.996(102) \"refers only to the traveled portion, paved or unpaved, of the roadbed actually designed for vehicular travel.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 623.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Con-versely, four justices specifically expressed their desire for an interpretation of the limiting language that would include installations\u2014even those located outside the improved portion of a highway designed for vehicular travel\u2014that integrally affected safe travel on the improved portion.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b383-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>We interpret <em>Scheurman </em>as reiterating the general rule, first articulated by this Court in <em>Roy, </em>that the highway exception does not normally include installations physically separate and detached from the paved or traveled portion of a highway. As is explained below, this interpretation is consistent with <em>Gregg, supra, </em>this Court\u2019s most recent majority interpretation of the highway exception. This interpretation of <em>Scheurman </em>is also consistent with the position we take in the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">3. <em>GREGG v dep\u2019t OF STATE HWYS</em></p>\n<p id=\"b383-6\">In <em>Gregg, supra, </em>a majority of this Court again affirmed that location is a key determinant for properly defining and applying the highway exception. There we held that a bicycle path running between the traveled portion of a highway and its paved shoulder comprised part of the improved highway \"designed for vehicular travel.\u201d In reaching this conclusion, we explained that highway shoulders, while not part of the normally traveled roadbed, were nevertheless intended and designed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>for vehicular travel. <em>Id. </em>at 314, citing <em>Johnson v Michigan, </em>32 Mich App 37; 188 NW2d 33 (1971). We held that the highway exception must be tempered by common experience, and that certain installations located beyond the traveled or paved roadway \"are essential to a safe modern highway\u201d so as not to be excluded from the highway exception. <em>Id. </em>at 315. This interpretation of the highway exception, we concluded, was more consistent with the exception\u2019s express purpose of protecting vehicular travelers by mandating the safe repair and maintenance of highways. <em>Id. </em>at 316.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-4\">c</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">The rule that can be derived from these decisions is clear, and we confirm it today: The limiting language of MCL 691.1402; MSA 3.996(102), creating liability only for \"the improved portion of a highway designed for vehicular travel,\u201d encompasses (1) installations physically located within that traveled or paved portion of a highway designed for vehicular travel, or (2) some installations, even those physically located beyond the traveled or paved portion of a highway, that directly and integrally affect safe vehicular travel on this improved portion.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-6\">This conclusion is consistent with our prior interpretations of the highway exception articulated in <em>Roy </em>and <em>Gregg, supra. </em>Furthermore, this conclusion incorporates the position, advocated by a majority of the justices in <em>Scheurman, </em>that the highway exception should not preclude potential governmental liability in \"cases alleging a failure to 'repair and maintain\u2019 installations that are integral to, if not part of, the 'improved portion of the highway designed for vehicular travel,\u2019 such as traffic lights and signs.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 637 (opinion of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>Boyle, J., and dissenting opinion of Brickley, J., joined by Levin and Archer, JJ.).</p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">More importantly, this interpretation of the highway exception is consistent with the overriding legislative intent that guides our inquiry today, namely, the assurance of safe, reliable highways to protect public vehicular travel. As we recognized in <em>Roy </em>and <em>Gregg, </em>this intent is manifestly evident from the plain language of MCL 691.1402; MSA 3.996(102), which commands highway authorities to repair and maintain highways for safe public travel.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-6\">Defendant asks us to adopt an interpretation of the highway exception that would limit liability exclusively to alleged defects arising on \"part of the physical structure of the roadbed\u201d or \"relat[ing] to conditions arising out of the roadbed.\u201d While we conclude in this case that a physical installation off the improved portion does not escape immunity, in view of the expressions of a majority of this Court in the above-referenced opinions, we respectfully decline defendant\u2019s request for such a limited interpretation of the highway exception. Even the most minimalist assurances of vehicular safety demand more than simply decreeing that potholes be repaired, and proper striping applied, to those state-owned highway's so greatly relied upon by both citizens and guests of this state. We do not interpret the limiting language of MCL 691.1402; MSA 3.996(102) in a manner so clearly inconsistent with, and damaging to, the highway exceptibn\u2019s clear and overriding legislative mandate demanding safe highways.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-7\">Nevertheless, it must be emphasized that the scope of liability under the highway exception is <em>not </em>all-encompassing. Indeed, potential liability is expressly limited to that \"improved portion of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>highway designed for vehicular travel.\u201d MCL 691.1402; MSA 3.996(102). This limiting phrase, of course, necessarily defines the scope of duties and liabilities sanctioned by the highway exception. In this respect, the restrictive phrase is a spatial limitation: all duties, and all liabilities, must accomplish the purpose of promoting safe vehicular travel <em>on the improved portion.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">To summarize: in light of the clear legislative purpose that we must uphold, we interpret the limiting language of the highway exception as including only installations physically located on, or deemed to integrally affect, those properties comprising \"the improved portion of a highway designed for vehicular travel.\u201d This interpretation adequately fulfills the legislative goals of the provision, while recognizing that it is also a narrowly defined exception to a broad grant of immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-6\">m</p>\n<p id=\"b386-7\">Turning now to the facts of this instant case we conclude, albeit for different reasons, that the Court of Appeals did not err in reversing the Court of Claims denial of defendant\u2019s motion for summary disposition. Accordingly, we affirm the decision of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-8\">The Court of Appeals read our decision in <em>Scheurman </em>as having interpreted the statutory phrase \"improved portion of the highway designed for vehicular travel\u201d to encompass <em>only </em>\"the traveled portion of a roadbed actually designed for public vehicular travel.\u201d <em>Chaney, supra </em>at 730. We note that this narrow reading does not comport with our interpretation of the limiting language. Rather, and as explained above, we have interpreted this statutory phrase as including installations physically located within that traveled or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>paved portion of a <em>highway </em>designed for vehicular travel (including that \"traveled portion of a roadbed actually designed for public vehicular travel\u201d), as well as, in some narrowly defined circumstances, installations located beyond this improved portion that directly and integrally affect safe vehicular travel on the highway.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">Applying this interpretation of the limiting language, we conclude that governmental immunity precludes liability for the bridge railing at issue in this instant case. First, it is clear that this bridge railing\u2014lying outside both the curb and the shoulder of the highway\u2014is not physically located within that improved portion of the highway designed for vehicular travel. Unlike the bicycle path in <em>Gregg, </em>this bridge railing is not part of the highway shoulder. Rather, like the bike path in <em>Roy, </em>this bridge railing is physically separate and \"detached\u201d from the improved portion of this highway.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-6\">Second, the bridge railing does not directly and integrally affect vehicular travel along the improved portion of this highway. Neither a guardrail nor a concrete abutment, located beyond the shoulder of a highway, has any effect upon the safe and convenient passage of vehicles while on the improved portion. In this respect, the bridge railing here is markedly different from the traffic lights and signs alluded to by Justice Boyle in <em>Scheurman, supra. </em>Traffic signals and signs are purposely designed to directly affect the flow of vehicular traffic on the improved portion of a highway. If these installations fail, traffic <em>on the improved portion of a highway </em>is directly and integrally affected: the likelihood of accidents increases, as does the related probability of injury to vehicular passengers.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-7\">In contrast, a guardrail or concrete abutment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>permanently located beyond the shoulder of a highway simply cannot cause an accident that originates on the improved portion of a highway. Indeed, the sole purpose and effect of the bridge railing here\u2014i.e., to prevent vehicles from accidentally leaving the highway\u2014is <em>only </em>implicated <em>after </em>a vehicle has left the improved portion. Accordingly, barriers such as guardrails and concrete abutments are not directly and integrally related to safe travel along the highway\u2014the barrier is simply not necessary for safe vehicular travel on and along the improved portion.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">iv</p>\n<p id=\"b388-6\">Because the bridge railing at issue here was not physically located within the improved portion of a highway designed for vehicular travel, and because it did not directly and integrally affect safe vehicular travel on the improved portion of the highway, we conclude that the highway exception is inapplicable and that governmental immunity is available to defendant. Accordingly, we affirm the decision of the Court of Appeals.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b377-9\"> MCL 691.1402(1); MSA 3.996(102)(1) provides, in pertinent part, that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b377-10\">Each governmental agency having jurisdiction over any highway shall maintain the highway in reasonable repair so that it is reasonably safe and convenient for public travel.

The dissenting justices would have held that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-8\">the \"improved portion\u201d language of [MCL 691.1402; MSA 3.996(102)] does not distinguish the surface of the highway as opposed to conditions other than the surface of the highway which may well foreclose the highway <em>from </em>being \"reasonably safe.\u201d <em>[Id. </em>at 641.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b383-9\">Additionally, while concurring in both the rationale and result of the lead opinion, Justice Boyle also indicated a preference for interpreting the limiting language to include installations \"integral to\u201d safe passage along the improved portion of a highway.

The first viewpoint is that because the state\u2019s liability is limited to the \"improved portion of the highway designed for vehicular travel,\u201d and because the plain meaning of this statutory language can only be interpreted to encompass the roadbed on which vehicles travel, only those accidents that are caused by a condition directly on this roadbed qualify for the exception to immunity. <em>Post </em>at 168, Riley, J. <em>Scheurman v Dep\u2019t of Transportation, </em>434 Mich 619; 456 NW2d 66 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b388-9\">Another viewpoint, represented by Justice Levin\u2019s writings, is that any accident that results from the use of the improved portion of the highway, whether or not it occurs thereon or is caused by a condition thereon, is subject to potential liability. <em>Post </em>at 196-198, Levin, J.</p>\n<p id=\"AGn\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>I distinguish my position from the foregoing views in that I read the statute as creating liability for an accident that occurs on the improved portion of the highway caused by a condition that affects that improved portion, regardless of the ultimate location of that cause. Hence, this and my prior decisions allow for <em>recovery </em>when, and only when, the occurrence is on the improved portion and is caused by a condition directly affecting vehicular travel on the improved portion, even though that condition may have been occasioned by an act or an omission outside the improved portion of the highway.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-8\">As expressed herein, it is my view that this latter interpretation best captures the essence of a statute that provides liability for mishaps occurring on the improved portion of the highway, but which does so without any direct reference to the location of their causality. This interpretation also protects the stated purpose of the statute to avoid liability for accidents that occur outside the improved portion of the highway, regardless of their cause.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b389-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>Riley, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Aqc\"><em>(concurring in part and dissenting in part). </em>While I agree that the state is immune from liability in the instant case, because I find that it may not be liable for damages arising from installations directly and integrally affecting vehicular safety on the improved portion of the highway unless the highway is unreasonably unsafe because of physical disrepair of the improved portion of the roadbed designed fo<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>\" vehicular travel, I write separately.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">i</p>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">At issue in the instant case is whether defendant may be held liable for injuries to a motorcyclist that allegedly occurred because of defendant\u2019s failure to properly design, construct, and maintain a bridge railing.

Hence, each word of \u00a1an act is \"presumed to be made use of for some purpose,\u201d and \"so far as possible, effect must be\u2019 given to every clause and sentence.\u201d <em>Univ of Michigan Bd of Regents v Auditor General, </em>167 Mich 444, 450; 132 NW 1037 (1911). Accordingly, the Court may not substitute or redefine a word, <em>People v Crucible Steel Co of America, </em>150 Mich 563, 567; 114 NW 350 (1907), or assume that the Legislature mistakenly utilized one word or phrase instead of another. <em>Detroit v Redford Twp, </em>253 Mich 453, 456; 235 NW 217 (1931). Thus, \"'[a] fundamental principle guiding this Court is that a clear and unambiguous statute leaves no room for judicial construction or interpretation.\u201d <em>Coleman v Gurwin, </em>443 Mich 59, 65; 503 NW2d 435 (1993).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In other words, \"[a] statute is not open to construction as a matter of course, but only where the language used in the statute requires interpretation\u2014where it is ambiguous or where 2 or more constructions can be placed upon it, where it is of such doubtful or obscure meaning that reasonable minds might be uncertain or disagree as to its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>meaning.\u201d <em>Lansing v Lansing Twp, </em>356 Mich 641, 649; 97 NW2d 804 (1959). These rules of statutory construction are especially appropriate in the instant case because, historically, Michigan has strictly construed statutes imposing liability on the state in derogation of the common-law rule of sovereign immunity. See, e.g., <em>Detroit v Putnam, </em>45 Mich 263, 265; 7 NW 815 (1881); <em>Johnson v Ontonagon Co Bd of Co Rd Comm\u2019rs, </em>253 Mich 465, 468; 235 NW 221 (1931).</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b392-6\">The majority finds that the statute permits liability when injuries arise from \"(1) installations physically located within that traveled or paved portion of a highway designed for vehicular travel, or (2) some installations, even those physically located beyond the traveled or paved portion of a highway, that directly and integrally affect safe vehicular travel on this improved portion.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 158. The majority reasons that such an interpretation of the statute is consistent with both precedent and the legislative intent of the statute. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b392-7\">Contrary to the conclusion of the majority, the clear and unambiguous language of the statute imposes liability only when the physical highway is unreasonably unsafe because of physical disrepair of the improved portion of the road designed for vehicular travel. The language is not so doubtful or obscure that reasonable minds need to search behind its words to find its meaning. This Court has explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-8\">[T]he duty imposed by the statute upon the state and county road commissions is restricted to the \"improved portion of the highway designed for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>vehicular travel . . . In <em>Roy </em>[v <em>Dep\u2019t of Transportation, </em>428 Mich 330, 339; 408 NW2d 783 (1987)], we observed that the limited scope of the term \"highway\u201d found in \u00a7 2 parallels the common understanding of the word. We are in accord with the conclusion reached in <em>Roy. </em>Therefore, we hold today that the phrase \"improved portion of the highway designed for vehicular travel\u201d refers only to the traveled portion, paved or unpaved, of the roadbed actually designed for public vehicular travel. <em>Roy, supra.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-5\">The purpose of the highway exception is not to place upon the state or counties an unrealistic duty to ensure that travel upon the highways will always be safe. Looking to the language of the statute, we discern that the true intent of the Legislature is to impose a duty to keep the physical portion of the traveled roadbed in reasonable repair. <em>[Scheurman v Dep\u2019t of Transportation, </em>434 Mich 619, 630-631; 456 NW2d 66 (1990).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b393-6\">Hence, \"compliance with the conditions and restrictions of the highway exception statute negates the inclusion of street lighting within the duty of the state because the physical structure of the lights falls outside the traveled or paved portion of the roadbed actually designed for public vehicular travel.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 633. Similarly, a county is not liable for obstructions of the highway caused by private hedges because it lacks any \"connection to the traveled portion of the roadbed designed for public vehicular traffic.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 636.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b393-7\">The plain language of the statute, therefore, simply does not permit liability for injuries arising from a bridge railing. A bridge railing is not an \"improved portion of the highway designed for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>vehicular travel.\u201d While a bridge railing is designed for vehicular safety, it is not a portion of the highway on which motor vehicles were designed to travel. Nor does the statute expressly impose liability for bridge railings. To the contrary, the bridge railings, separated from the roadbed by a raised curb and a paved shoulder, are akin to \"sidewalks, crosswalks, or any other instal- \u2018 lation outside the improved portion of the highway . . . .\u201d Generally, bridge railings, not unlike lighting or vegetation, exist outside the improved portion of the highway designed for vehicular travel and are not a part of the roadbed. Nor are there allegations that this particular bridge railing posed a danger to those traveling on the improved portion of the highway. Thus, the unambiguous language of the statute excludes injuries arising from the bridge railing.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>_</p>\n<p id=\"b395-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>In <em>Scheurman, supra </em>at 632, the Court noted that necessity of lighting for safety purposes was not the issue before it, but whether lighting was an improved portion of the highway designed for vehicular travel. Similarly, contrary to the conclusion of the majority, the issue in the instant case is not whether bridge railings are necessary for safety, but whether an exception to common-law immunity has been provided for accidents arising from the failure to properly design, maintain, and repair such installations. The majority, however, ignores the narrow issue presented and expands - the sovereign immunity exception to include all injuries arising from any installation that \"directly and integrally affecfjsj safe vehicular travel on\u201d the improved portion of the highway in contradiction of the clear language of the statute. <em>Ante </em>at 158. While the obvious purpose undergirding the section is to compensate injured persons when the highway is unsafe for vehicular travel, it does so only in very limited circumstances. The statute does not provide blanket liability for all injuries that deprive drivers of conditions essential to safety on the highway itself. The statute only provides for liability if the injuries arise from the failure to repair or maintain the improved portion of the highway designed for vehicular travel.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The majority attempts to reconcile this holding with precedent and legislative intent, but ignores the proper focus of the inquiry: the plain language of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">Furthermore, the holding is inconsistent with <em>Scheurman. </em>The majority explains that liability may arise from those installations \"deemed to integrally affect, those properties comprising 'the improved portion of a highway designed for vehi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>cular travel.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ante </em>at 160. Thus, installations beyond the roadbed, but which affect traffic on it, may give rise to liability. This Court, however, has rejected liability arising from blocked vision caused by overhanging hedges or inadequate lighting, both of which are located outside the roadbed, but which also affect traffic <em>on </em>the roadbed. <em>Id. </em>In effect, the majority overrules <em>Scheurman </em>because hedges and lighting that block drivers\u2019 vision certainly affect s\u00ed ,'efy on the highway. Indeed, adequate lighting and unobstructed views are more essential to the proper and safe flow of traffic because bridge railings, as the majority notes, have no \"effect upon the safe and convenient passage of vehicles while on the improved portion.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 161.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">The majority\u2019s holding appears to be based on the conclusion that the Legislature could not have been so unwise as to have intended a result inconsistent with the majority\u2019s. Yet, the wisdom, fairness, or incongruity of the statute is not our concern. The judiciary may not amend statutes to conform with its policy preferences. The Legislature, not the Court, is the lawmaking authority within our constitutional order of separate powers. Unless the constitution invalidates a legislative enactment, the propriety and wisdom of such enactments are not for this Court to question. Unwise legislative enactments must be rectified by the democratic safeguards and checks in the constitution: ballot box,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> initiative,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> referendum,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>constitutional amendment.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Finding itself wiser than the Legislature and the people, the majority reaches beyond the plain language of the act and crafts a new statute reflective of its sensibilities. Because this is not our role in the constitutional order, I concur solely with the result reached by the majority.</p>\n<judges id=\"b397-5\">Griffin, J., concurred with Riley, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b390-7\"> At common law, local governments were immune from suits arising from the negligent upkeep of highways. <em>Nile Twp Hwys Comm\u2019rs v Martin, </em>4 Mich 557 (1857).

While the first two sentences of the statute impose general duties and liability on defendant to \"maintain the highway in reasonable repair,\u201d the fourth sentence explicitly limits such liability \"to-the improved portion of the highway designed for vehicular travel\u201d and exempts from liability \"sidewalks, crosswalks, or any other installation outside of the improved portion of the highway designed for. vehicular travel.\u201d While Justice Levin repeatedly criticizes members of the Court for ignoring statutory language and for so-called \"myopic\u201d interpretations of the statute at issue, his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>interpretation blatantly misconstrues the statute by making meaningless the fourth sentence of the provision.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b395-7\"> Thus, injuries arising from crumbling roads or collapsing bridges, for instance, are clearly compensable.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b396-6\"> Art 2, \u00a7 8 (\"Laws shall be enacted to provide for the recall of all elective officers except judges of courts of record\u201d); art 4, \u00a7 2 (senators are to be elected every four years); art 4, \u00a7 3 (representatives are to be elected every two years); art 5, \u00a7 21 (the Governor is to be elected every four years).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b396-7\"> Art 2, \u00a7 9 (\"The people reserve to themselves the power to propose laws and to enact and reject laws, called the initiative\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b396-8\"> <em>Id. </em>(\"The people reserve to themselves . . . the power to approve or reject laws enacted by the legislature, called the referendum\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b397-9\"> Art 12, \u00a7\u00a7 1-3 (outlining three methods to amend the state constitution).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b397-6\">Boyle, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Abt\">(concurring). I agree with Justice Brickley\u2019s conclusion that the defendant is immune from liability for accidents that are allegedly caused by its failure to properly repair, maintain, or construct concrete bridge abutments or guardrails that are beyond the shoulder of a state trunk line.

See MCL 691.1407; MSA 3.996(107); <em>Ross v Consumers Power Co (On Rehearing), </em>420 Mich 567, 618; 363 NW2d 641 (1984).

[MCL 691.1402(1); MSA 3.996(102)(1).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b398-6\">The difficulty is that the phrase \"improved portion of the highway designed for vehicular travel\u201d draws no obvious line. We know, because the statute tells us, that it does not include sidewalks and crosswalks, which are for pedestrian travel. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>However, the contrast between the improved portion and \"any other installation outside of the improved portion\u201d is not helpful because, in this context, the word \"outside\u201d does not seem to denote a spatial relationship. \"Crosswalks,\u201d one example of an \"installation outside of the improved portion,\u201d are not physically outside the highway, but are instead part of the pavement<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and are shared with vehicular traffic.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">It seems to be generally agreed that the improved portion includes the paved surface as well as bicycle paths that are part of the paved portion. See <em>Gregg v Dep\u2019t of State </em>Hwys, 435 Mich 307, 316; 458 NW2d 619 (1990). On the other hand, it does not include bicycle paths that are detached from, but parallel to, the traveled portion of the roadway. <em>Roy v Dep\u2019t of Transportation, </em>428 Mich 330, 331; 408 NW2d 783 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b399-6\">It also seems to be agreed that, as a general rule, the \"improved portion of the highway designed for vehicular travel\u201d does not include installations outside the edges of the roadway. The limiting sentence was the subject of this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Scheurman v Dep\u2019t of Transportation, </em>434 Mich 619; 456 NW2d 66 (1990).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In that case, we held that governmental agencies are immune <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>from liability for failing to install lighting next to a freeway because \"the physical structure of the lights falls outside the traveled or paved portion of the roadbed actually designed for public vehicular travel.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 633. In a companion case, we held that a hedge growing on private property that allegedly interfered with a driver\u2019s vision was not part of the improved portion of the highway. <em>Id. </em>at 635.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">I cannot agree, however, with Justice Brickley\u2019s statement that the highway exception includes \"some installations, even those physically located beyond the traveled or paved portion of a highway, that directly and integrally affect safe vehicular travel on this improved portion.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 158. The test is less helpful than the statute itself. I am now persuaded that the test is so imprecise that it would foster litigation with no clear countervailing benefit. Governmental agencies attempting to avoid liability by fulfilling their duty cannot know with certainty what it is that they are required to do. Injured persons seeking advice regarding litigation could not be given reasonable evaluation of the parameters of the government\u2019s responsibility, and trial judges would be left without standards to determine the question of the scope of the duty to maintain. In the end, the phrase would mean that governmental agencies will be liable whenever this Court, at the end of a long and expensive road of appellate litigation, deems it reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-7\">Although the language of the statute is far from clear, I think the best course for this Court is clear. We should reaffirm the precedents of this Court that construed the exception after its adop<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>tion and say that the state (and counties) may be liable under the highway exception only when it falls to repair and maintain<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the paved surface of the roadway, including objects on and structures supporting that surface, or traffic signs or traffic signals necessary for safe vehicular travel.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">Of course, given this clarification, it will not follow that all variations of the above-listed defects will come within the exception. Because the issue is not squarely presented in the case before us, we cannot say with certainty that there can be any liability for given signs and signals.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> However, traffic signs and traffic signals in general are improvements that are designed for vehicular travel, as opposed to pedestrian traffic, and are essential to safe and efficient vehicular travel. Moreover, there is textual support for the conclusion that governmental agencies may be liable for failing to repair or maintain signs and signals. By the early eighties, it was established that \"the duty to maintain a highway in reasonable repair encompasses the maintenance of traffic signs.\u201d <em>Salvati v Dep\u2019t of State Hwys, </em>415 Mich 708, 715; 330 NW2d 64 (1982).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In 1986, the Legislature narrowed liability <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>under the highway exception by excluding trees and utility poles from the definition of \"highway\u201d as that term is used in the highway exception. MCL 691.1401(e); MSA 3.996(101)(e). Before the amendment, this section had stated merely that \"[t]he term 'highway\u2019 shall not be deemed' to include alleys.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Because, at that time, governmental units could be liable for failing to repair and maintain traffic lights and signs, and because the Legislature restricted liability without mentioning signs and traffic lights, it is reasonable to infer<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> that it intended that governmental units should be liable for failing to repair and maintain signs and signals.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-6\">In this case, I would affirm the decision of the Court of Appeals. The plaintiff\u2019s claim is barred by governmental immunity because he does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>allege a failure to repair and maintain the paved surface of the roadway or a traffic sign or signal.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b397-10\"> Each governmental agency having jurisdiction over any high.way shall maintain the highway in reasonable repair so that it \u25a0is reasonably safe and convenient for public travel.

In <em>Ross v Consumers Power Co (On Rehearing), </em>420 Mich 567, 596; 363 NW2d 641 (1984), this Court sought \"to create a cohesive, uniform, and workable set of rules which . . . readily define the injured party\u2019s rights and the governmental agency\u2019s liability.\u201d It was against this backdrop and our goal of remaining \"faithful to the statutory language and legislative intent\u201d of the government tort liability act<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> that this Court recognized broad governmental immunity with narrowly drawn exceptions.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Because Justice Riley\u2019s offering remains faithful to these premises, I reluctantly join her opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-6\">Admittedly, Justice Riley\u2019s plain interpretation of the highway exception results in harsh consequences. Her interpretation, however, is defensible because it is in accord with the plain language of the statute<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and <em>Ross\u2019 </em>command of broad governmental immunity with narrowly drawn exceptions. Furthermore, Justice Riley\u2019s interpretation provides an exact standard, defining not only an injured party\u2019s rights but the government\u2019s poten<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>tial liability. None of the other separate opinions satisfies each of these components.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-4\">Although I find Justices Brickley\u2019s and Boyle\u2019s interpretations preferable from a policy standpoint, I cannot in good conscience join either opinion. Justice Brickley\u2019s interpretation does not provide a standard with which to guide both the bench and bar. The test is vulnerable to endless interpretation, encouraging recurrent appellate litigation. Justice Boyle\u2019s interpretation, while more limited in scope, is not supported by the statutory language or <em>post-Ross </em>case law.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">Finally, Justice Levin\u2019s interpretation, while sympathetic to the plight of injured plaintiffs, effectively abrogates governmental immunity within the realm of highway transportation. While the Legislature obviously intended to except certain situations from the shield of governmental immunity, it certainly did not intend to provide limitless application of the highway exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-6\">I find it inconceivable that liability under the highway exception should be so severely limited, nevertheless for the reasons stated above, I am compelled to strictly construe the statute. The badly fractured opinions seen in this case and <em>Mason v Wayne Co Bd of Comm\u2019rs, </em>447 Mich 130; 523 NW2d 791 (1994), scream for legislative action.

A motorist who, like the driver in Arnold,<footnotemark>66</footnotemark> has experienced a highway emergency necessitating that he move onto the shoulder understands that where the far side of a shoulder is a precipice, as in the instant case where the ramp was an overpass of 1-94, a barrier on the far side of the shoulder is as \"essential to a safe modern highway\u201d as the shoulder itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-6\">The majority slices the bologna far too thin in holding that the Legislature intended that a shoulder be included within the highway exception but not a barrier alongside the shoulder.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-7\">This is not a case where the mdot saw no need to install a barrier. We are long past the day when highway authorities might ordinarily ignore the need for barriers when designing a highway.

It would appear \u2014but because this is not an issue in this case, I do not formally address it\u2014that, to the extent that that standard is less than what would constitute reasonable repair, and in condition reasonably safe and fit for travel by <em>pedestrians, </em>the townships and city continue to be responsible.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"59\">\n<p id=\"b430-6\"> <em>Roy </em>was decided by per curiam opinion. We all agreed that the highway exception \"does not extend to injuries which arise from detached, ancillary installations, such as sidewalks, crosswalks, and bicycle paths.\u201d <em>Id., </em>p 331.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-7\">Roy was riding his bicycle on a bicycle path adjacent to a portion of 1-275. The complaint alleged that there was a \" 'substantial asphalt bump,\u2019 \u201d and that the mdot\u2019s agents had cut weeds and piled them over the area of the bump, and, as a result, he was unable to see the bump and was thrown from his bicycle when he encountered it. <em>Id., </em>p 332.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"60\">\n<p id=\"b430-8\"> The improved portion of the roadway leading to and from rest stops and truck stops, and possibly the parking areas, are improved portions of the highway designed for vehicular travel.

I make these observations because the construction placed by the majority on the fourth sentence attributes a meaning to \"any other installation\u201d that, in my judgment, is clearly wrong, and I feel obliged to show that there is another reading that gives those words substantial meaning.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"62\">\n<p id=\"b431-8\"> Ante, p 161 (opinion of Brickley, J.).</p>\n<p id=\"b431-9\">The opinion declares that it reads <em>Scheurman </em>as reiterating the general rule that the \"highway exception does not <em>normally </em>include installations physically separate and detached from the paved or traveled portion of a highway.\u201d <em>Id., </em>p 157 (emphasis added). The opinion continues that the limiting language of the fourth sentence of the highway exception \"creating liability only for 'the improved portion of a highway designed for vehicular travel,\u2019 encompasses (1) installations physically located within that traveled or paved portion of a highway designed for vehicular travel, or (2) some installations, even those physically located beyond the traveled or paved portion of a highway, that directly and integrally affect safe vehicular travel on this improved portion.\u201d <em>Id., </em>p 158.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-10\">The language in (2) above parallels the \"integral\u201d language in the concurring opinion in <em>Scheurman. </em>See text accompanying n 5 for the text of that opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"63\">\n<p id=\"b432-7\"> In <em>Fogarty v Dep\u2019t of Transportation, </em>200 Mich App 572; 504 NW2d 710 (1993), formal abeyance for <em>Mason, </em>February 28, 1994 (Docket No. 97248), the plaintiff\u2019s decedent was killed when his automobile was struck head on by an automobile being driven by the defendant\u2019s decedent, Mancini. Mancini was traveling southbound on 1-75 when he lost control of his vehicle, passed through a grassy median, and entered the northbound lanes in which the plaintiff\u2019s decedent was traveling. The plaintiff claims that the mdot failed to adequately design, construct, and repair the median.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-8\">The Court of Appeals held that th'e grassy median is not part of the highway designed for vehicular travel. While the mdot is not required to repair and maintain the median in condition reasonably safe and fit for travel, and as set forth in text accompanying n 60, the median is generally an \"other installation,\u201d that does not relieve the mdot of the obligation to erect barriers necessary to maintain the improved portion of a highway, such as expressway lanes moving in opposite directions, in condition reasonably safe and fit for travel.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-9\">See also <em>Sinishtaj v Dep\u2019t of State Hwys, </em>unpublished opinion per curiam of the Court of Appeals, issued April 30, 1993 (Docket No. 135368), formal abeyance for <em>Chaney, </em>December 3, 1993 (Docket No. 96641). The plaintiff is the guardian of a woman who was hurt when her automobile went over a guardrail on M-59 near Adams Road. She claims the mdot breached its duty to keep M-59 in a manner reasonably safe and fit for public travel. The woman\u2019s automobile struck a guardrail, went over the guardrail, and rolled down a steep embankment. The Court of Appeals granted summary disposition on the basis of its decision in <em>Chaney </em>and <em>Scheurman.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"64\">\n<p id=\"b433-9\"> One justice dissented, stating that a shoulder of a highway is not within the highway exception because it is not designed for vehicular travel but rather for the temporary accommodation of disabled or stopped vehicles. <em>Gregg, supra, </em>p 317 (Griffin, J., dissenting).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"65\">\n<p id=\"b434-9\"> <em>Gregg, supra, </em>p 308 (Riley, C.J., dissenting).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"66\">\n<p id=\"AXj\"> See text accompanying n 38.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"67\">\n<p id=\"b435-8\"> <em>Id., </em>p 631.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"68\">\n<p id=\"b435-9\"> In a recent opinion, construing the gross negligence exception to employee governmental immunity, MCL 691.1407(2)(c); MSA 3.996(\u00cd07)(2)(c), a majority observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-10\">It defies common sense and the responsible exercise of our authority to conclude that the Legislature would have provided protection tantamount to eliminating liability without having commented on it. <em>[Dedes v Asch, </em>446 Mich 99, 115; 521 NW2d 488 (1994).]</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"69\">\n<p id=\"b436-9\"> The plurality opinion in <em>Scheurman </em>reads out from the highway exception the words stricken in the foregoing text, and in effect renders the highway exception almost no exception at all.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"70\">\n<p id=\"b437-10\"> <em>Id., </em>p 631.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"71\">\n<p id=\"b437-11\"> <em>Id., </em>p 623.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"72\">\n<p id=\"b437-12\"> Neither <em>Scheurman </em>itself nor its companion case, <em>Prokop, </em>concerned allegations of design or construction defects.

Indeed, the thought that the fourth sentence might provide a basis for holding that there is no governmental liability for \"negligent design and construction of highways\u201d was so far out of mind that the fourth sentence was not quoted in the dissenting opinion. The quotation of the highway exception set forth in the dissenting opinion concluded with the third sentence. <em>Id., </em>p 20 (Riley, C.J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b441-9\">The view expressed in the dissenting opinion was based, rather, on the first sentence of the highway exception.

Furthermore, I interpret \"maintain ... in reasonable repair\u201d as encompassing only those repairs necessary as a result of normal highway usage. The statute does not impose a duty to repair defects in design or construction. <em>[Id. </em>Emphasis in original.]</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"78\">\n<p id=\"b441-11\"> Llewellyn, Common Law Tradition, Deciding Appeals, p 206.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"79\">\n<p id=\"b441-12\"> See n 76 and accompanying text.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"80\">\n<p id=\"b442-7\"> Except as noted in n 6.
