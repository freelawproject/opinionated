Our answer turns on the scope of the manifest-necessity exception to the double jeopardy bar and its application to the particular facts presented. We conclude that the Double Jeopardy Clause allows retrial of defendant Hicks, but precludes retrial of defendant Bellew. Accordingly, we would reverse the Court of Appeals decision in <em>People v Hicks,</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and we would affirm its decision in <em>People v </em>Bellew.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>_</p>\n<p id=\"b1049-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"823\">*823</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b1049-4\">Both cases arise out of bench trials presided over by Judge Daphne Curtis of the Detroit Recorder\u2019s Court, and involve her failure before trial to disclose a relationship with one of the parties. In each case, the prosecutor learned of the relationship and directed the court\u2019s attention to this information after several witnesses had testified. A midtrial dilemma ensued when the judge abruptly recused herself and refused to participate further in either trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1049-5\">A. <em>PEOPLE v HICKS</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1049-6\">Defendant Hicks was charged with assault with intent to murder<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and possession of a firearm during the commission of a felony<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> in a bench trial that commenced on September 9,1991. During the lunch recess, after three witnesses had testified, the assistant prosecutor discovered that defendant\u2019s brother was Gregory Hicks, a friend of Judge Curtis who had served as her campaign manager when she was elected to judicial office. After the lunch recess, the assistant prosecutor brought this fact to the attention of Judge Curtis. She admitted that a person named Gregory Hicks had been her campaign manager and friend for the last ten years, and then she invited the parties to comment on their respective positions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1049-7\">Defense counsel argued against the judge\u2019s recusal, indicating that Gregory Hicks would not be a witness in the case. The assistant prosecutor declined to comment. Judge Curtis then recused herself.</p>\n<p id=\"b1049-8\">Shortly thereafter the parties appeared before <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"824\">*824</page-number>Judge Terrance Boyle.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> He offered to continue the trial before him, but defendant rejected this proposal. Judge Boyle then entered a mistrial \"as an official thing to clean up what happened there,\u201d and he denied defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss the case on double jeopardy grounds, reasoning that Judge Curtis\u2019 recusal after acknowledging that she might be affected by her knowledge of the questioned relationship was the functional equivalent of a mistrial prompted by manifest necessity.</p>\n<p id=\"b1050-6\">A divided panel of the Court of Appeals reversed and dismissed the case, concluding that \"manifest necessity [did not exist to warrant] a mistrial over defendant\u2019s objection and the state is barred from placing defendant in jeopardy a second time on these charges.\u201d 201 Mich App 197, 203-204; 506 NW2d 269 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b1050-7\">In a vigorous dissenting opinion, Judge Hammond posited that if Judge Curtis had dropped dead, fallen ill, or become disabled during the course of the trial, no one would dispute that manifest necessity justified a mistrial. He deemed the situation resulting from Judge Curtis\u2019 recusal analogous to \" 'a breakdown in judicial machinery such as happens when the judge is stricken, or a juror has been discovered to be disqualified to sit . . . .\u2019 \u201d <em>Gori v United States, </em>367 US 364, 372; 81 S Ct 1523; 6 L Ed 2d 901 (1961) (Douglas, J., dissenting). <em>Id. </em>at 206.</p>\n<p id=\"b1050-8\">We granted the prosecutor\u2019s application for leave to appeal. 445 Mich 862 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b1050-9\">B. <em>PEOPLE v BELLEW</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1050-10\">A retrial of defendant Bellew on a felony charge of receiving and concealing stolen property in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"825\">*825</page-number>excess of $100 <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> commenced on June 9, 1992.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> After two witnesses had testified, the trial was continued until June 23,1992.</p>\n<p id=\"b1051-6\">During the interim, the prosecutor filed a motion to disqualify Judge Curtis, alleging that the defense attorney was \"in some way associated in the practice of law\u201d with Judge Curtis\u2019 spouse. The motion focused on Judge Curtis\u2019 ethical obligation to disclose this alleged relationship, and her failure to do so. Defense counsel answered by challenging the grounds for disqualification and requesting Judge Curtis to deny the motion or hold an evidentiary hearing. Counsel argued that \"[w]hether that relationship would provide a basis under these circumstances for this Court to recuse itself on the vague generalization is unsubstantiated,\u201d and that in light of the \"substantial constitutional interests\u201d involved, it was \"an outrage\u201d for the prosecution to file this motion. Stating that she had not engaged in any misconduct, Judge Curtis nonetheless recused herself to insure that both sides felt \"their rights are protected and that impartiality is assured . . . .\u201d She declined to address defendant\u2019s request for an evidentiary hearing, choosing instead to refer the matter to Chief Judge Dalton Roberson.</p>\n<p id=\"b1051-7\">The chief judge declared a mistrial, and then granted defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss, holding that retrial was barred by the Double Jeopardy Clause._</p>\n<p id=\"b1052-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"826\">*826</page-number>A unanimous panel of the Court of Appeals upheld the chief judge\u2019s decision, concluding that, while manifest necessity is an elusive concept, with considerable deference being accorded a trial court\u2019s application of this concept, such deference could not operate to cloak the mere appearance of impropriety under the umbrella of manifest necessity.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Unpublished opinion per curiam, issued January 7, 1994 (Docket No. 157434).</p>\n<p id=\"b1052-6\">We granted the prosecutor\u2019s application for leave to appeal, and ordered that this case be argued and submitted with <em>People v Hicks.</em><footnotemark><em>9</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1052-7\">ii</p>\n<p id=\"b1052-8\">Under both the Michigan<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and the federal<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> constitutions, an accused cannot be placed in jeopardy twice for the same offense.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Jeopardy attaches \"once the defendant is put to trial before the trier of fact, whether [it] be a jury or a judge.\u201d <em>United States v Jorn, </em>400 US 470, 479; 91 S Ct 547; 27 L Ed 2d 543 (1971). In a bench trial, jeopardy attaches once the court begins to hear <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"827\">*827</page-number>evidence. <em>Serfass v United States, </em>420 US 377, 388; 95 S Ct 1055; 43 L Ed 2d 265 (1975).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1053-5\">An oft-repeated statement of the reasons justifying this protection is set forth in <em>Green v United States, </em>355 US 184, 187-188; 78 S Ct 221; 2 L Ed 2d 199 (1957), where the Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1053-6\">The underlying idea, one that is deeply ingrained in at least the Anglo-American system of jurisprudence, is that the State with all its resources and power should not be allowed to make repeated attempts to convict an individual for an alleged offense, thereby subjecting him to embarrassment, expense and ordeal and compelling him to live in a continuing state of anxiety and insecurity, as well as enhancing the possibility that even though innocent he may be found guilty.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1053-7\">Despite the concern for repeated prosecutions, it is axiomatic that retrial is not automatically barred whenever circumstances compel the discharge of a factfinder before a verdict has been rendered.</p>\n<p id=\"b1053-8\">One exception to the double jeopardy bar arises when a defendant moves for or consents to a mistrial. In <em>United States v Dinitz, </em>424 US 600, 607; 96 S Ct 1075; 47 L Ed 2d 267 (1976), the Supreme Court held that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1053-9\">\"where circumstances develop not attributable to prosecutorial or judicial overreaching, a motion by the defendant for mistrial is ordinarily assumed to remove any barrier to reprosecution, even if the defendant\u2019s motion is necessitated by prosecutorial or judicial error. \u201d[<footnotemark>14</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1054-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"828\">*828</page-number>Consequently, retrial is not barred whenever a defendant has consented to a mistrial and the consent was not precipitated by prosecutorial or judicial goading.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1054-5\">In addition to the consent exception, the Supreme Court has consistently maintained that retrial is permitted when the mistrial was occasioned by manifest necessity. The classic formulation of the test to be applied in determining whether retrial is permissible was articulated by Justice Story in <em>United States v Perez, </em>22 US (9 Wheat) 579, 580; 6 L Ed 165 (1824):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1054-6\">We think, that in all cases of this nature, the law has invested Courts of justice with the authority to discharge a jury from giving any verdict, whenever, in their opinion, taking all the circumstances into consideration, there is a manifest necessity for the act, or the ends of public justice would otherwise be defeated. They are to exercise a sound discretion on the subject; and it is impossible to define all the circumstances, which would render it proper to interfere. To be sure, the power ought to be used with the greatest caution, under urgent circumstances, and for very plain and obvious causes ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1054-7\">The impetus behind this rule was the recognition that even personal security and freedom from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"829\">*829</page-number>governmental harassment should not be purchased at the high cost of barring <em>all </em>retrials following a mistrial declared without the defendant\u2019s consent. <em>Jorn, supra </em>at 480. The Supreme Court has stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1055-5\">[A] defendant\u2019s valued right to have his trial completed by a particular tribunal must in some instances be subordinated to the public\u2019s interest in fair trials designed to end in just judgments. <em>[Wade v Hunter, </em>336 US 684, 689; 69 S Ct 834; 93 L Ed 974 (1949).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1055-6\">Determining whether manifest necessity exists to justify the declaration of a mistrial requires a balancing of competing concerns: the defendant\u2019s interest in completing his trial in a single proceeding before a particular tribunal versus the strength of the justification for a mistrial. Recognizing the tension between these two concerns, the Supreme Court has held that the <em>Perez </em>doctrine commands trial judges to refrain from declaring a mistrial until \"a scrupulous exercise of judicial discretion leads to the conclusion that the ends of public justice would not be served by a continuation of the proceedings.\u201d <em>Jorn, supra </em>at 485.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Each case necessarily depends on its own particular facts. <em>Illinois v Somerville, </em>410 US 458, 464; 93 S Ct 1066; 35 L Ed 2d 425 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b1056-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"830\">*830</page-number>Despite the command to decide each case on its own facts, the Supreme Court in <em>Somerville </em>concluded it was possible to distill some general rules from individual cases, premised on the \"public justice\u201d prong articulated in <em>Perez. </em>The <em>Somerville </em>Court had determined there was manifest necessity for a mistrial where under local law, a defect in the indictment neither could be cured by amendment nor waived by the defendant. The Court held that a trial judge properly exercises discretion to declare a mistrial when an impartial verdict cannot be obtained, or when a guilty verdict could be returned but would be reversed on appeal because of an obvious procedural error occurring during the trial. Any doubts concerning the existence of manifest necessity should be resolved in favor of the defendant. <em>Downum v United States, </em>372 US 734, 738; 83 S Ct 1033; 10 L Ed 2d 100 (1963). With these considerations in mind, we turn to the cases at bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b1056-5\">m</p>\n<p id=\"b1056-6\">As a preliminary matter, we note that in both the cases at bar, Judge Curtis\u2019 recusal occurred after several witnesses had testified. Jeopardy had thus attached.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Consequently, retrial would be barred in either case in the absence of consent by the defendant or manifest necessity justifying the mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1056-7\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b1056-8\">We cannot conclude that the defendant in either case consented to the mistrial. Both defendants <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"831\">*831</page-number>adamantly opposed Judge Curtis\u2019 decision to recuse herself and expressed their desire to continue with the chosen factfinder. Accordingly, consent cannot be derived from defendants\u2019 actions surrounding Judge Curtis\u2019 recusal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1057-4\">Moreover, we decline to extract consent from defendant Hicks\u2019 justifiable refusal to accept the alternatives proffered by Judge Boyle<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> or from a motion by defendant Bellew for declaration of mistrial<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> and to dismiss. We note that the hallmark of consent is the defendant\u2019s retention of primary control over the course of his trial. <em>Dinitz, supra </em>at 609. The consent <em>Dinitz </em>envisioned manifests itself in a defendant\u2019s decision to forgo taking his case \" 'to the first jury and, perhaps, end the dispute then and there with an acquittal.\u2019 \u201d <em>Dinitz, supra </em>at 608, quoting <em>United States v Jorn, supra </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"832\">*832</page-number>at 484.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> A careful reading of the record, however, compels the conclusion that neither defendant opted to forgo a ruling by Judge Curtis on his guilt or innocence.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> In fact, both defendants opposed her recusal. In this sense, Judge Curtis\u2019 recusal did not comport with the expressed desires of either defendant.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Because Judge Curtis\u2019 recusal extinguished defendants\u2019 option to \"go to the first jury,\u201d we cannot conclude that either of the defendants consented to a mistrial.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1059-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"833\">*833</page-number>Moreover, in <em>Bellew, </em>we believe it would be patently unfair to construe defendant\u2019s motion for declaration of mistrial and for dismissal as consent to the mistrial, in light of defendant\u2019s vigorous <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"834\">*834</page-number>objection to Judge Curtis\u2019 recusal. Defendant\u2019s motion evidenced his belief that the functional equivalent of a mistrial had occurred upon Judge Curtis\u2019 recusal. Although we reject this view today, we decline to transform defendant\u2019s attempted clarification of the recusal into consent for a mistrial occasioned by an event outside of defendant\u2019s control.</p>\n<p id=\"b1060-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b1060-7\">With respect to the manifest-necessity exception to double jeopardy, we heed the counsel provided by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Somerville, supra, </em>to decide each case on the basis of its own unique factual setting. We find instructive the analysis employed by the dissenting Court of Appeals judge in <em>Hicks. </em>Our focus must be on what actually occurred at the trial court level. Accordingly, we turn to a more detailed examination of the factual setting of each of these cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b1060-8\">1</p>\n<p id=\"b1060-9\">a. <em>PEOPLE v HICKS</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1060-10\">As noted above, despite opposition to recusal expressed by counsel for defendant Hicks, Judge Curtis recused herself after the assistant prosecutor discovered and called attention to the judge\u2019s relationship with defendant\u2019s brother. Judge Curtis expressed her reasoning:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1060-11\">All right. The problem with sitting as a judge, particularly in a waiver trial is that not only do I have to be concerned about whether I might be influenced in my rulings or in my findings by knowing someone in the defendant\u2019s family but also whether or not it looks improper, the appear<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"835\">*835</page-number>anee of impropriety and the Cannons [sic] refer to both of those situations as it applies to judges. <em>I might be in\u00f1uenced by knowing his brother now that I know that I know his brother. I don\u2019t really think that I would be, but I think just as important is the fact that it would not look good, </em>that the appearance of impropriety could certainly result from my continuing as the trier of fact in this case. ... I don\u2019t think that it is proper for the Court to continue in this case for the reasons that I have just stated <em>and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s proper to dismiss the case either. </em>[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1061-6\">I am not necessarily in agreement that [the assistant prosecutor] created the mistrial. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1061-7\">I think the better way of resolving this is to recuse myself, disqualify myself from further proceedings in this matter and to refer the matter to the chief judge ... to determine whether or not this case should be dismissed or a mistrial declared because I suppose one might argue that my decision regarding a dismissal or mistrial might be influenced by my knowledge of the defendant\u2019s brother, or my knowing the defendant\u2019s brother.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1061-8\">Judge Curtis recused herself, and shortly thereafter the parties appeared before Judge Boyle, to whom the case was assigned.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1061-9\">After reviewing what had transpired in Judge Curtis\u2019 court, Judge Boyle concluded that a mistrial had not been formally declared; he discerned that neither party desired a mistrial, and then he observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1061-10\">That leaves a number of options open. I could continue with that trial and use the transcript, or we could continue with the trial and have all the witnesses recalled before me, or I could declare a mistrial and the defendant could then decide as a matter of a new trial whether to have a jury or a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"836\">*836</page-number>bench trial in front of me. That option in my view goes exclusively to the defendant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1062-6\">Defense counsel responded by stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1062-7\">It would be our position that the Court really doesn\u2019t have the options of continuing the case from where it left off or recalling the witnesses. We believe that once Judge Curtis recused herself, that is a technical declaration of a mistrial.[<footnotemark>25</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1062-8\">Judge Boyle stated that \"what [Judge Curtis] did was the functional granting of a mistrial whether or not she used the words . . . .\u201d He entered a mistrial \"as an official thing to clean up what happened there,\u201d but he denied defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss, concluding that Judge Curtis\u2019 expressed discomfort with the situation justified her recusal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1062-9\">I wouldn\u2019t have done what she did, I\u2019ve already made that perfectly clear. But I\u2019m not gonna say that what she did was wrong . . . where a judge can certify on the record that the judge says there is a manifest necessity for me to excuse myself from continuing as a fact-finder in this case, an appellate tribunal ought to be pretty loathe to say that\u2019s not manifest necessity if the judge thinks its manifest necessity.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1062-10\">And for that reason, I\u2019m gonna deny the motion to dismiss on grounds of double jeopardy . . . ._</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1063-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"837\">*837</page-number>b. <em>PEOPLE v BELLEW</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1063-6\">In <em>Bellew, </em>after the trial had begun and witnesses had testified, Judge Curtis granted the assistant prosecutor\u2019s motion for disqualification, which alleged that the defense attorney and the judge\u2019s spouse were somehow associated in the practice of law.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> Judge Curtis referred the matter to the chief judge without holding a hearing on the allegations.</p>\n<p id=\"b1063-7\">The parties immediately appeared before the chief judge, where they agreed that Judge Curtis had not declared a mistrial.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> The prosecutor focused on Judge Curtis\u2019 statement that she was \"simply refer[r]ing it to Chief Judge Roberson for assignment,\u201d<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> and argued that a successor judge should continue the trial. The chief judge told the prosecutor to find case authority for substituting a judge midtrial, or he might send the case back to Judge Curtis.</p>\n<p id=\"b1063-8\">When the parties appeared again before the chief judge, the prosecution agreed that a mistrial had to be granted, but asserted that retrial should be permitted, because Judge Curtis\u2019 recusal was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"838\">*838</page-number>analogous to the death of a judge in the middle of the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1064-4\">The chief judge granted the mistrial, and later granted defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss, holding that retrial was barred by the Double Jeopardy Clause:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1064-5\">As in <em>Little,[</em><footnotemark><em>29</em></footnotemark><em>] </em>the defendant emphatically objected to the declaration of a mistrial when the trial court failed to make explicit findings as to manifest necessity. Although the trial court found an appearance of impropriety, manifest necessity to justify a mistrial has not been demonstrated. The trial judge clearly indicated that she would be able to remain impartial.[<footnotemark>30</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1064-6\">2</p>\n<p id=\"b1064-7\">In each of these cases, the record establishes that Judge Curtis did not formally declare a mistrial. She merely recused herself.</p>\n<p id=\"b1064-8\">In each case, the defendant contends that Judge Curtis\u2019 action in recusing herself was functionally equivalent to declaring a mistrial. Acceptance of this interpretation would render the failure to formally declare a mistrial virtually meaningless; the applicable analysis would be similar to that employed had Judge Curtis actually declared the mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1064-9\">In contrast, the prosecutors in both cases urge us to treat Judge Curtis\u2019 midtrial recusal and refusal to further participate as an illness or other disability sustained in the middle of the trial. This <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"839\">*839</page-number>midtrial disability constituted manifest necessity justifying the mistrial. Put another way, the recusal in the middle of trial caused the mistrial; it was not the mistrial itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b1065-6\">We find the prosecutors\u2019 arguments more persuasive on this issue. A mistrial is defined as a \"[t]rial which has been terminated prior to its normal conclusion.\u201d<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> Although Judge Boyle ultimately concluded in <em>Hicks </em>that Judge Curtis\u2019 actions were the functional equivalent of a mistrial, he reached this conclusion only after defendant Hicks had rejected the proffered alternatives to aborting the trial:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1065-7\">Unless the defendant consented to go forward in front of another judge with the same continued proceeding, either using the transcript, as I\u2019ve already made perfectly clear on the record, if the defendant opted for that, I\u2019d do that even over the prosecution\u2019s objection and I would do that because I think the defendant does have a right to that alternative.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1065-8\">But the defendant doesn\u2019t wish to do that and I don\u2019t think the defendant can be forced to do that.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1065-9\">Judge Boyle\u2019s exploration of alternatives supports our conclusion that Judge Curtis\u2019 actions should not be equated with a mistrial.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> While the options were admittedly limited, the trial should not have been terminated until such options had been considered. Stated another way, Judge Curtis\u2019 recusal operated neither as an automatic termination of the proceedings nor a necessary foreclosure of the continuation of such proceedings before <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"840\">*840</page-number>another judge. On this basis, we cannot conclude that Judge Curtis\u2019 recusal, without more, <em>necessarily </em>terminated the trial before its natural conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1066-6\">Consequently, we adopt the argument advanced by the prosecutors, and treat Judge Curtis\u2019 mid-trial recusal and refusal to further participate as a \"disability\u201d incurred by the factfinder during the trial. Support for this characterization can be found in the decision of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit in <em>United States v </em>Sartori, 730 F2d 973, 976 (CA 4, 1984),<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> that a trial judge\u2019s midtrial recusal was encompassed within the term \"other disability\u201d contained in Rule 25(a) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> While the dispositive issue in <em>Sartori </em>was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"841\">*841</page-number>the trial court\u2019s failure to consider reasonable alternatives to a mistrial, alternatives existed once the court recognized that a midtrial recusal was analogous to a disability.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1067-5\">We believe Judge Curtis\u2019 refusal to further participate presented a situation not unlike that created by the midtrial disability of a trial judge. We are cognizant of the general rule, reiterated in <em>Sartori, </em>that trial judges must consider reasonable alternatives before declaring a mistrial. We note, however, that in contrast to the district judge in <em>Sartori, </em>Judge Curtis never reached the moment when reasonable alternatives were to be explored. For purposes of this trial, she became \"disabled\u201d when she recused herself, yet at this point, she had not declared a mistrial.

Once defendant rejected the \"lesser included\u201d protection of finality, Judge Boyle had no choice but to declare a mistrial.

At a minimum, the chief judge should have expressly raised the possibility of completing the trial before a different judge. Even after losing his \"particular tribunal,\u201d defendant may have opted to exercise his \"lesser included\u201d interest in finality, and chosen to continue the trial before another factfinder, preserving any recorded testimony that he perceived to be favorable.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1069-5\">The chief judge did allude to the possibility of appealing Judge Curtis\u2019 recusal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1069-6\">Hold it, Your remedy is in the Court of Appeals, not here, because I have no authority to rule on. her motion to disqualify herself once she grants it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1070-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"844\">*844</page-number>We are not suggesting such an appeal should have been taken; we are merely noting another option that the chief judge failed to adequately explore.</p>\n<p id=\"b1070-6\">We will not attempt to discern whether defendant would have accepted any of these options.

Finding this to be a close case, and being cognizant of the command to resolve doubts in favor of the defendant, <em>Downum, supra, </em>we decline to hold that manifest necessity existed to justify the mistrial in <em>Bellew.</em><footnotemark><em>40</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1070-8\">iv</p>\n<p id=\"b1070-9\">Accordingly, we conclude that Judge Curtis\u2019 recusal and refusal to continue in both <em>Hicks </em>and <em>Bellew </em>is analogous to a midtrial disability suffered by the presiding judge, and that the determination whether manifest necessity existed to justify a mistrial necessarily depends on whether a \"scrupulous exercise of discretion\u201d by the successor judge would have revealed reasonable alternatives to declaring a mistrial. We conclude that only Judge Boyle properly considered available alternatives to declaring a mistrial, and that in <em>Hicks, </em>the defendant\u2019s justified refusal of the prof<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"845\">*845</page-number>fered alternatives constituted manifest necessity for the mistrial. Consequently, defendant Hicks may be retried consistent with the protections afforded by the Double Jeopardy Clause, but retrial of defendant Bellew is barred by the Double Jeopardy Clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b1071-5\">Accordingly, we would reverse the decision of the Court of Appeals in <em>Hicks </em>and would remand for retrial, and we would affirm the decision of the Court of Appeals in <em>Bellew.</em></p>\n<judges id=\"b1071-6\">Mallett, J., concurred with Griffin, J.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b1071-7\">Brickley, J., concurred only in the result.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1048-14\"> 201 Mich App 197; 506 NW2d 269 (1993).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1048-15\"> Unpublished opinion of the Court of Appeals, issued January 7, 1994 (Docket No. 157434).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1049-9\"> MCL 750.83; MSA 28.278.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1049-10\"><em> </em>MCL 750.227b; MSA 28.424(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1050-11\"> Judge Curtis had telephoned Judge Evans, the acting chief judge, and informed him of her recusal.

It now is apparent that there will be problems because of the known relationship between the judge and the defendant\u2019s family. The prosecution does not move for a mistrial, to disqualify the judge, or for anything else. The judge refused to participate further and, if the double jeopardy claim is upheld the defendant gets off absolutely free from a life offense (and from a charge of possession of a firearm during the commission of a felony) because the trial judge, by some legal mumbo jumbo, made it forever impossible for the prosecution to continue the case against the defendant to judgment and sentence.

THE CASES AT BAR</p>\n<p id=\"b1073-9\">The lead opinion properly focuses its inquiry on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"848\">*848</page-number>whether manifest necessity justified each mistrial.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> It relies on direction from <em>Jorn:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1074-6\">[T]he determination whether manifest necessity existed to justify a mistrial necessarily depends on whether a \"scrupulous exercise of discretion\u201d by the successor judge would have revealed reasonable alternatives to declaring a mistrial. [Opinion of Griffin, J., p 844.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1074-7\">I agree with the lead opinion\u2019s analysis of the constitutional considerations up to this point. However, I would add an additional inquiry that we stated in <em>Dawson: </em>whether the cause prompting the mistrial was outside the prosecutor\u2019s and the trial judge\u2019s control. <em>Id. </em>at 252.</p>\n<p id=\"b1074-8\">In each of the cases at bar, I would hold that the cause prompting mistrial was within the control of the prosecutor or of the trial judge. Therefore, neither mistrial was compelled by manifest necessity.</p>\n<p id=\"b1074-9\">In each case, the lead opinion sidesteps the issue whether the trial judge\u2019s recusal, on the basis of the appearance of impropriety, was justified.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Instead, the lead opinion equates the trial judge\u2019s recusal to a disability, and examines the successor judge\u2019s actions. By focusing on the \"clean-up\u201d part of the case histories, the lead opinion would create an arbitrary, bright-line: A judge can disqualify <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"849\">*849</page-number>himself from a case for any reason, and as long as the successor judge recites a litany of options, whether or not they are meaningful options,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> manifest necessity is established and retrial can proceed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1075-6\">Unfortunately, as Justice Harlan indicated,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> manifest necessity cases are much more complex and should be decided by the constitutional balancing test. Accordingly, I believe that the sounder approach is to focus on the real cause of each trial\u2019s termination: the trial judge\u2019s recusal without apparent justification. I would <em>then </em>determine whether manifest necessity existed, \"whether a 'scrupulous exercise of discretion\u2019 by the successor judge would have revealed reasonable alternatives to declaring a mistrial,\u201d Griffin, J., <em>ante </em>at 844, and whether the cause of the mistrial was outside the control of the prosecutor and the trial judge. I turn now to the individual cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b1075-7\">III. <em>PEOPLE v HICKS</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1075-8\">In <em>Hicks, </em>neither party moved for recusal. The trial judge, sua sponte, recused herself and transferred the case to the chief judge, who in turn assigned the case to a successor judge. When the trial judge recused herself, the prosecutor could have filed an interlocutory appeal for a determina<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"850\">*850</page-number>tion whether the appearance of impropriety was sufficient to justify recusal and, in turn, whether manifest necessity was established, compelling a mistrial. The prosecutor did not do so. If the appellate court had ruled that the trial judge should proceed with the trial, the trial could have continued to its conclusion.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> A mistrial would then have been avoided.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Therefore, the cause of the mistrial was within the prosecutor\u2019s control.</p>\n<p id=\"b1076-6\">I would hold that defendant Hicks\u2019 right to have his fate decided in one proceeding by the sitting trial judge outweighed society\u2019s interest in prosecuting him where the prosecutor did not pursue an interlocutory appeal of the trial judge\u2019s recusal in order to preserve the prosecutor\u2019s claim that manifest necessity compelled the mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1076-7\">IV. <em>PEOPLE v BELLEW</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1076-8\">In <em>Bellew, </em>the prosecutor moved for recusal. The trial judge granted this motion over the defendant\u2019s objection and recused herself.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Even though the trial judge did not declare a mistrial, the cause of the mistrial was within her control: she could have referred the case to the chief judge for a hearing on whether she could proceed.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> If the chief <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"851\">*851</page-number>judge then ruled that she could proceed, the trial could have proceeded to its conclusion.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> A mistrial would then have been avoided.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1077-4\">I would hold that defendant Bellew\u2019s right to have his fate decided in one proceeding by the sitting trial judge outweighed society\u2019s interest in prosecuting him where the trial court granted the prosecutor\u2019s motion to disqualify herself, over the defendant\u2019s objection, without first determining that recusal was necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b1077-5\">v. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1077-6\">I would find that a reasonable alternative to mistrial existed, i.e., a hearing on whether recusal was required, and that the cause of the mistrial was not outside the control of the prosecutor in <em>Hicks </em>and the trial judge in <em>Bellew. </em>Therefore, in both of the instant cases, I would affirm the Court of Appeals holding that retrial was barred by double jeopardy.</p>\n<judges id=\"b1077-7\">Levin, J., concurred with Cavanagh, C.J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1071-11\"> <em>People v Hicks, </em>201 Mich App 197; 506 NW2d 269 (1993); <em>People v Bellew, </em>unpublished per curiam opinion of the Court of Appeals, issued January 7, 1994 (Docket No. 157434).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1074-10\"> Neither defendant consented to waive his right to avoid double jeopardy.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1074-11\"> The court rule provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1074-12\">A judge is disqualified when the judge cannot impartially hear a case ....

Further, simply substituting judges in a <em>bench </em>trial would deprive the defendant of having his trier-of-fact hear firsthand the testimony of the witnesses on cross-examination. Finally, the option of declaring a mistrial would deprive the defendant of his preferred choice of having the first trial judge decide his fate.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1075-10\"> <em>Jorn </em>at 485.

Before trial, the prosecutor dismissed three of the four receiving and concealing stolen property counts and the chop shop count because of an inability to produce material witnesses. At the conclusion of a waiver trial before the Honorable Daphne Means Curtis, the defendant was found guilty of receiving and concealing stolen property over $100 and of the four counts of altering a vin with the intent to mislead another regarding the identity of the motor vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b1078-8\">Before sentencing, the defendant dismissed his attorney and retained attorney Walter Pookrum, who filed a motion for a new trial on the basis of ineffective assistance of counsel. Several hearings were held between November 21, 1991, and February 24, 1992. On February 24, 1992, Judge Curtis found prior counsel ineffective in respect to the receiving and concealing of stolen property count, and granted defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial on that basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b1078-9\">Defendant waived a trial by jury, and a bench trial before Judge Curtis began on June 9, 1992, but was not finished because of the court\u2019s docket. The trial was adjourned until June 23, 1992 upon agreement of the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b1078-10\">On June 16, 1992, the prosecutor learned about what seemed to be a business arrangement between new defense counsel and Paul Daniel Curtis, the trial judge\u2019s husband. Although the exact details of the arrangement were not known by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"853\">*853</page-number>prosecutor, business cards indicated that the two individuals shared a common office, a common fax number, and the same receptionist. The prosecutor represented in his written motion that a call to Mr. Pookrum at Mr. Curtis\u2019 office yielded the response that Mr. Pookrum was not presently in but that they would have him return the call.</p>\n<p id=\"b1079-5\">A motion to disqualify was brought before Judge Curtis on June 23, 1992. Without granting a mistrial, Judge Curtis recused herself \"[t]o insure that each of the sides in this particular litigation feels that their rights are protected and that impartiality is assured . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1079-6\">The litigants then appeared before Judge Dalton Roberson, who almost immediately suggested that the propriety of Judge Curtis\u2019 recusation was a matter for the Court of Appeals, not himself. The prosecutor then argued that the case should continue with another judge. The judge responded by stating twice that he did not think it was permissible to switch triers of fact in the middle of a trial, and that a mistrial had to be declared. Each time, defense counsel agreed. The court scheduled a subsequent hearing to allow the prosecutor to submit authority on the issue of changing triers of fact in a bench trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1079-7\">At the hearing, the prosecutor began by stating, \"I questioned whether you had to grant a mistrial. At that point, your Honor, I looked into it. The defense said you had to grant a mistrial. I agree, your Honor, I think you should grant a mistrial and assign it for trial.\u201d With defense counsel stating, \"I don\u2019t think you have any choice about that,\u201d Judge Roberson formally declared a mistrial. The discussion turned to whether a second trial would violate the Double Jeopardy Clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b1079-8\">On September. 25, 1992, Judge Roberson issued an opinion holding that retrial would be barred on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"854\">*854</page-number>double jeopardy grounds. The prosecutor appealed, and the Court of Appeals affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1080-4\">ii</p>\n<p id=\"b1080-5\">At the point that Judge Curtis recused herself, the defense counsel had two choices, each of which he clearly understood. He could have continued the trial before a different judge who had read the transcripts, as the prosecutor initially suggested, and preserved his objections to recusal for appeal in the event of conviction. Alternatively, defense counsel could have opted to abandon the trial and begin anew. Counsel objected to reassignment, insisted on a mistrial, and the mistrial was declared at his request.</p>\n<p id=\"b1080-6\">The defendant now attempts to fashion a third option, one that is the moral equivalent of eating his cake and having it too. The defendant, who asked for the mistrial, now claims that the state is barred from further prosecution because the mistrial was not necessary. The lead opinion agrees and holds the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1080-7\">1. The defendant\u2019s request for a mistrial did not lift the bar to double jeopardy because he did not have the option of completing the trial before the judge who began it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1080-8\">2. Therefore, retrial is barred unless the prosecutor shows manifest necessity for the mistrial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1080-9\">3. The retrial was not manifestly necessary because the judge did not \"explore\u201d the defendant\u2019s choices before granting his request.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1080-10\">Because I disagree with each of these propositions, I respectfully dissent. I would hold:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1081-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"855\">*855</page-number>1. The defendant\u2019s request for the mistrial lifted the bar to double jeopardy because the defendant\u2019s request was not intentionally provoked by the prosecution.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1081-6\">2. Because the mistrial was declared at the defendant\u2019s request, the state does not need to justify the declaration. The \"manifest necessity\u201d strand of double jeopardy precedent applies where a mistrial is granted over the defendant\u2019s objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1081-7\">3. Even if this case were properly analyzed under the line of cases involving sua sponte declarations of mistrial, or mistrial over the defendant\u2019s objection, thus requiring the prosecution to show manifest necessity, it has met this requirement. Judge Roberson\u2019s decision to grant a mistrial was necessary in the strictest sense of the word. Because counsel resisted any alternative, he had no other choice.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1081-8\">4. The lead opinion\u2019s requirement that the judge must \"explore\u201d alternatives available to the defendant may be appropriate where the cause of the mistrial is subject to manipulation by the prosecutor, and the defendant asserts feasible alternatives to a mistrial. Where the trial has begun and the cause of the mistrial is not one that the prosecutor has manipulated to avoid an acquittal, the defendant\u2019s interest in completing the proceedings is subordinate to the public interest in affording the prosecution one full and fair opportunity to present the evidence to an impartial fact-finder.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1081-9\">5. Where the situation triggering mistrial is potential bias of the factfinder, the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"856\">*856</page-number>court\u2019s exercise of discretion in declaring a mistrial is entitled to the highest deference.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1082-6\">hi</p>\n<p id=\"b1082-7\">The result in <em>People v Bellew </em>is governed by application of a very straightforward rule: \"a motion by the defendant for mistrial is ordinarily assumed to remove any barrier to reprosecution, even if the defendant\u2019s motion is necessitated by prosecutorial or judicial error.\u201d <em>United States v Dinitz, </em>424 US 600, 607; 96 S Ct 1075; 47 L Ed 2d 267 (1976); see also <em>Oregon v Kennedy, </em>456 US 667, 672-673; 102 S Ct 2083; 72 L Ed 2d 416 (1982). After a trial is aborted on the defendant\u2019s own motion, a second trial is barred only \"where the governmental conduct in question is intended to 'goad\u2019 the defendant into moving for a mistrial . . . .\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 676. There is not the slightest suggestion of such intent here, nor would the record support it. Therefore, the defendant\u2019s request for a mistrial waives the bar to double jeopardy, and he may be retried.</p>\n<p id=\"b1082-8\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b1082-9\">The lead opinion initially errs by analyzing both <em>Hicks </em>and <em>Bellew </em>under the manifest-necessity standard for declarations of mistrial over the defendant\u2019s objection. However, as the facts clearly indicate, there is a critical distinction between the cases. The defendant in <em>Hicks </em>did not move for a mistrial but resisted any alternative to Judge Curtis\u2019 declaration of disqualification. The record in <em>Hicks </em>thus arguably presents the issue whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"857\">*857</page-number>\"manifest necessity\u201d justified the mistrial.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> However, this test applies only \"[w]here the trial is terminated over the objection of the defendant . . . .\u201d <em>Oregon v </em>Kennedy, <em>supra, </em>456 US 672 (\"in the case of a mistrial declared at the behest of the defendant, quite different principles come into play\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1083-4\">The lead opinion states that it \"cannot conclude that the defendant [Bellew] consented to the mistrial,\u201d because he objected to Judge Curtis\u2019 decision to recuse herself and expressed a desire to conclude the trial before her. <em>Ante </em>at 830. The approach thus confuses defendant\u2019s objection to Judge Curtis\u2019 action with the remedy he sought in light of it.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> It is necessary to support the proposition that, because the defendant\u2019s ideal choice\u2014 continuing the trial before the judge whose husband he apparently shared an office with\u2014was no longer available, his request for a mistrial did not amount to consent. However, the analysis fails to acknowledge that this method of analyzing a defendant\u2019s request for mistrial has been rejected by the United States Supreme Court. The relevant inquiry for present purposes is not why counsel believed that a mistrial should be declared, but whether he opted for that alternative instead of choosing to continue the trial. As the lead opinion acknowledges, defendant sought \"a declaration of a mistrial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1083-5\">In <em>United States v Dinitz, supra, </em>the Supreme Court emphasized that only a request is necessary to lift the bar to double jeopardy.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The trial court excluded Dinitz\u2019 lead attorney from his trial and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"858\">*858</page-number>then declared that if the defendant did not appeal that order, he would have to choose between continuing the trial the next day with co-counsel and a mistrial. Because he felt he needed more time to obtain outside counsel, the defendant elected a mistrial. 424 US 604. He was tried again and convicted on both counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b1084-6\">A divided panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit reversed the convictions for reasons strikingly similar to those employed here to support the conclusion that counsel for defendant <em>Bellew </em>did not consent. See Griffin, J., <em>ante </em>at 831-832. The Court of Appeals in <em>Dinitz </em>reasoned that the trial court\u2019s exclusion of counsel had left respondent no choice but to ask for a mistrial and therefore the \"request for a mistrial should be ignored and the case treated as though the trial judge had declared a mistrial over the objection of the defendant.\u201d 424 US 605. The court held that \" 'something more substantial than a Hobson\u2019s choice\u2019 is required before a defendant can 'be said to have relinquished voluntarily his right to proceed before the first jury.\u2019 \u201d 424 US 608 (quoting <em>United States v </em>Dinitz, 492 F2d 53, 59 [CA 5, 1974]).</p>\n<p id=\"b1084-7\">The Supreme Court granted certiorari and reversed, specifically quoting and rejecting the position that the lead opinion here adopts: that the request for mistrial should be ignored. The Court emphasized that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1084-8\">traditional waiver concepts have little relevance where the defendant must determine whether or not to request or consent to a mistrial in response to judicial or prosecutorial error. ... In such circumstances, the defendant generally does face a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"859\">*859</page-number>\"Hobson\u2019s choice\u201d between giving up his first jury and continuing a trial tainted by prejudicial judicial or prosecutorial error. The important consideration, for purposes of the Double Jeopardy Clause, is that the defendant retain primary control over the course to be followed in the event of such error. [424 US 609.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1085-5\">Double jeopardy rights, unlike the right to counsel, for example, do not require a knowing, intelligent waiver. When a defendant seeks the mistrial, \"the central policy of the Double Jeopardy Clause \u2014to protect defendants from <em>governmen </em>\u00bf-instigated multiple prosecutions and sentences\u2014is not implicated.\u201d <em>United States v Jamison, </em>164 US App DC 300, 305; 505 F2d 407 (1974), cited with approval in <em>Dinitz, </em>424 US 609 (emphasis in original). The <em>Jamison </em>court summarized its lengthy explanation<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> of why mistrial motions cannot be treated as waivers of rights, which would require the defendant\u2019s personal approval and full advice of rights, with this concise statement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1085-6\">The startling implication of barring reprosecution after a mistrial brought about by defense counsel\u2019s own errors and on his own motion is that the government could irrevocably lose the right to prosecute for a given crime without itself having committed the least impropriety, and with the trial judge having erred only in declining to second guess defense counsel as to the accused\u2019s best interests. <em>[Id. </em>at 306.]_</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1086-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"860\">*860</page-number>Confirming that \"traditional waiver concepts have little relevance where the defendant must determine whether or not to request or consent to a mistrial\u201d the Court further explained in <em>Dinitz, </em>424 US 609:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1086-6\">The respondent characterizes a defendant\u2019s mistrial motion as a waiver of \"his right not to be placed twice in jeopardy\u201d and argues that to be valid the waiver must meet the knowing, intelligent, and voluntary standard set forth in <em>Johnson v Zerbst, </em>304 US 458 [58 S Ct 1019; 82 L Ed 1461 (1938)]. This approach erroneously treats the defendant\u2019s interest in going forward before the first jury as a constitutional right comparable to the right to counsel. It fails to recognize that the protection against the burden of multiple prosecutions underlying the. constitutional prohibition against double jeopardy may be served by a mistrial declaration and the concomitant relinquishment of the opportunity to obtain a verdict from the first jury. This Court has implicitly rejected the contention that the permissibility of a retrial following a mistrial or a reversal of a conviction depends on a knowing, voluntary, and intelligent waiver of a constitutional right. See <em>Breed v Jones, </em>421 US 519, 534 [95 S Ct 1779; 44 L Ed 2d 346 (1975)]; <em>United States v Wilson, </em>420 US 332, 343-344, n 11 [95 S Ct 1013; 43 L Ed 2d 232 (1975)]; <em>United States v Jorn, </em>400 US 470, 484-485, n 11 [91 S Ct 547; 27 L Ed 2d 543 (1971)] (plurality opinion); <em>United States v Tateo, </em>377 US [463, 466; 84 S Ct 1587; 12 L Ed 2d 448 (1964)]. <em>[Id. </em>at 609-610, n 11.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1086-8\">Viewed in this light, the case is on all fours with <em>Dinitz. </em>Bellew faced the same alternatives:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1086-9\">(1) continuing with the trial in spite of the judge\u2019s decision; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1086-10\">(2) a declaration of a mistrial. (Compare 424 US 609.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1087-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"861\">*861</page-number>Like Dinitz, Bellew selected a mistrial. Thus <em>Dinitz </em>is controlling not only in its rationale, but in its holding.</p>\n<p id=\"b1087-6\">The lead opinion appears to limit <em>Dinitz </em>to cases in which the defendant can complete his trial with the same factfinder: \"Unlike other trial errors, a judge\u2019s decision sua sponte to recuse herself after jeopardy has attached in a bench trial deprives a defendant of the option to obtain a verdict from the first factfinder.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 832, n 22. While the statement is true, it is constitutionally irrelevant. Like all errors that result in a mistrial, the declaration of a mistrial deprives a defendant of the right to obtain a verdict from the first factfinder.</p>\n<p id=\"b1087-7\">The issue is not whether the incident precipitating a declaration of mistrial was error or not. The Double Jeopardy Clause protects the defendant\u2019s right to choose to proceed with the trial and preserve the error for appeal if he is not acquitted, or to abort the trial and begin again. If defendant decides to abort the trial, his interests have been protected because he has made the choice.</p>\n<p id=\"b1087-8\">The availability of an alternative to a mistrial\u2014 continuing the trial with another judge\u2014was controlled by the defendant. Because he chose not to exercise it, the retrial he requested was not only manifestly necessary, but absolutely necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b1087-9\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b1087-10\">The attempt to distinguish <em>Dinitz </em>on the basis that Bellew was \"deprive[d] ... of the option to obtain a verdict from the first factfinder\u201d is based on erroneous assumptions. First, the Supreme Court has held that the option to obtain a verdict in the first trial is not essential to the permissibility of retrial. In <em>United States v Tateo, </em>377 US <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"862\">*862</page-number>466-467, the defendant pleaded guilty during his first trial because of improper threats by the judge. He subsequently withdrew his plea, received a trial, and was convicted. The Supreme Court held that the defendant\u2019s double jeopardy rights had not been violated even though he was involuntarily deprived of the choice to take his case to the first jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1088-6\">Tateo contends that his situation must be distinguished from one in which an accused has been found guilty by a jury, since his involuntary plea of guilty deprived him of the opportunity to obtain a jury verdict of acquittal. We find this argument unconvincing. If a case is reversed because of a coerced confession improperly admitted, a deficiency in the indictment, or an improper instruction, it is presumed that the accused did not have his case fairly put to the jury. <em>A defendant is no less wronged by a jury \u00f1nding of guilt after an unfair trial than by a failure to get a jury verdict at all; the distinction between the two kinds of wrongs affords no sensible basis for differentiation with regard to retrial. </em>[377 US 466-467. Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1088-7\">Second, assuming that Judge Curtis\u2019 decision to recuse herself was erroneous, Bellew in fact had the option to complete the trial and challenge the recusal as error requiring reversal. The prosecutor suggested continuation, but the defendant insisted on a mistrial. The statement that defendant Bellew did not waive these alternatives is thus both factually and legally incorrect.</p>\n<p id=\"b1088-8\">iv</p>\n<p id=\"b1088-9\">The foregoing indulges the assumptions that the principle right protected by double jeopardy is the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"863\">*863</page-number>right to have the trial completed before a particular tribunal, that the interest in finality is a \"lesser included\u201d protection, and that the right to a particular tribunal applies in a bench trial. These positions are premised on the language in <em>Dinitz </em>about \"taking [the defendant\u2019s] case ' \"to the first jury,\u201d \u2019 \u201d quoting <em>United States v Jorn, </em>400 US 470, 484; 91 S Ct 547; 27 L Ed 2d 543 (1971). <em>Ante </em>at 831, quoting Dinitz, 424 US 608. Applying this language to a bench trial takes it out of context. Losing the trier of fact in a jury trial means that the trial cannot continue. In a bench trial, on the other hand, a second judge may continue the trial from the point of interruption by reading the transcripts. See MCR 6.440(B).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1089-6\">The question is whether concluding a bench trial with a different judge constitutes double jeopardy. It appears that a defendant\u2019s valued right to a particular tribunal is merely an incident of the defendant\u2019s more generalized interest in being able to complete the trial itself. Professors Westen and Drubel\u2019s explanation of this position and examination of the relevant cases merits lengthy mention:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1089-7\">Before an analysis of this interest in finality, however, it may be useful to turn to value (4), i.e., the defendant\u2019s \"valued right to have his trial completed by a particular tribunal.\u201d Although the Court has never explored the nature of this valued right, there are several possible interpretations. One is that a defendant has a constitutional interest in having his case resolved by a tribunal that he perceives to be \"favorably disposed to his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"864\">*864</page-number>fate.\u201d[<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>] This suggestion finds no support in the Court\u2019s decisions. Assume, for example, that a case, having been assigned to a judge whom the defendant considers favorable, is reassigned to another judge before the trial commences. Or assume that a juror whom the defendant perceives to be favorable is excused and replaced by an alternate juror for no compelling reason. Whatever else may be objectionable about such changes, they can hardly be said to violate double jeopardy. Accordingly, \"the [defendant\u2019s] interest in having his 'trial completed by a particular tribunal\u2019 must refer to some interest other than retaining a fact-finder thought to be favorably disposed toward the defendant.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1090-5\">Another meaning is more likely. A defendant has a valued right to have his trial completed by a particular tribunal, not because he has a constitutional interest in the identity of any particular tribunal, but because he has an interest in being able \"to conclude his confrontation with society\u201d once it has begun. Once a trial begins, a defendant has a legitimate interest in getting the trial over with \"once and for all.\u201d It follows, therefore, that he also has an interest in continuing with \"the first jury\u201d impaneled in the c\u00e1se because changing the jury means interrupting the trial. To that extent, the defendant\u2019s interest in retaining the particular tribunal with which he began is merely an incident of his primary interest in being able to complete the trial itself. [Westen &amp; Drubel, <em>Toward a general theory of double jeopardy, </em>1978 Sup Ct R 81, 89-90.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1090-6\">Contrary to the assumption of the lead opinion, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"865\">*865</page-number>in cases since <em>Jorn, </em>the Court has identified the primary interest protected as being able once and for all to conclude confrontation with the state. It is this interest, rather than the value of proceeding with the first tribunal, that is balanced against the public interest in one full and fair opportunity for presentation of the prosecutor\u2019s evidence. See, generally, <em>Illinois v Somerville, </em>410 US 458; 93 S Ct 1066; 35 L Ed 2d 425 (1973); <em>Arizona v Washington, </em>434 US 497; 98 S Ct 824; 54 L Ed 2d 717 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b1091-6\">Had the defendant objected to the mistrial and agreed to have the case transferred to another judge, and the prosecutor objected to the transfer, or any other alternative, see n 4 above, thereby causing a mistrial to be declared over the defendant\u2019s objection, it might be more persuasively argued that defendant\u2019s interest in final confrontation had been violated. However, Bellew\u2019s interest in finality could have been served by transferring the case to a different judge. Defendant rejected that alternative, chose to abort the proceedings, and thus waived the opportunity to try the case to conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1091-7\">v</p>\n<p id=\"b1091-8\">Ignoring the defendant\u2019s request for mistrial, the lead opinion applies the manifest-necessity strand of jeopardy jurisprudence and states that the permissibility of a retrial is governed by the \"rule . . . that trial judges must consider reasonable alternatives before declaring a mistrial.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 841. The opinion construes this rule, which actually concerns the <em>availability </em>of alternatives to a mistrial over the defendant\u2019s objection, as a rule about the \"exploration\u201d <em>of possibilities. </em>On this basis, it concludes that retrial is barred, not be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"866\">*866</page-number>cause there were alternatives to a mistrial, but because the judge failed to \"adequately explore\u201d them, <em>id. </em>at 844:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1092-4\">At a minimum, the chief judge should have expressly raised the possibility of completing the trial before a different judge. Even after losing his \"particular tribunal,\u201d defendant may have opted to exercise his \"lesser included\u201d interest in finality, and chosen to continue the trial before another factfinder, preserving any recorded testimony that he perceived to be favorable. <em>[Id. </em>at 843.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1092-5\">The lead opinion\u2019s emphasis on \"adequate exploration\u201d is based on a misunderstanding of <em>United States v Sartori, </em>730 F2d 973 (CA 4, 1984), and fails to acknowledge that the Supreme Court has, in analogous contexts, rejected the contention that a declaration of mistrial must be the least drastic available remedy to constitute \"manifest necessity.\u201d In <em>Sartori, </em>the trial judge abruptly recused himself in the midst of a <em>jury trial </em>over the objection of both parties and sua sponte declared a mistrial. A different district judge ruled that the mistrial did not lift the bar to double jeopardy, and the court of appeals affirmed. The court held that it had not been manifestly necessary to declare a mistrial over the defendant\u2019s objection because the judge who declared the mistrial had an available alternative\u2014assigning the case to another judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b1092-6\"><em>Sartori </em>actually stands for the proposition that a mistrial should not be declared because of the disability of a judge presiding over a jury trial when the defendant objects to the mistrial and it can be avoided by substituting another presiding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"867\">*867</page-number>judge.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The lead opinion\u2019s statement that substitution was precluded in the absence of consent ignores the fact that, unlike defendant Sartori, who objected to the mistrial, defendant Bellew requested a mistrial. Likewise, assuming arguendo that Judge Roberson had to explore alternatives, the defendant declined a different judge and insisted on a mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1093-5\">The assumption that, as a matter of law, manifest necessity requires the exploration of less drastic alternatives to mistrial also ignores that the United States Supreme Court has specifically rejected the proposition that all other alternatives to a mistrial must be explored on the record in the context of a mistrial triggered by the possibility of bias. In <em>Arizona v Washington, </em>434 US 511, 516-517, the Court held that the record did not have to reflect the exploration and rejection of all available alternatives so as to establish the necessity for mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1093-6\">In <em>Washington, </em>the trial judge granted the prosecutor\u2019s motion for mistrial after defense counsel made improper prejudicial arguments during his opening statement. <em>Id. </em>at 499-501. Rejecting the argument that the mistrial was not necessary because the judge could have given cautionary instructions to the jury, Justice Stevens explained that \"the key word 'necessity\u2019 cannot be interpreted literally,\u201d but that there are degrees of necessity that vary depending on the circumstances. <em>Id. </em>at 506. The highest degree of necessity <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"868\">*868</page-number>\"is appropriate when the basis for the mistrial is the unavailability of critical prosecution evidence . . . <em>Id. </em>at 508.</p>\n<p id=\"b1094-5\">At the other end of the spectrum, however, are cases where mistrial is triggered by the possibility that the factfinder may be prejudiced. <em>Id. </em>at 510. The Court observed that when the difficulty leading to mistrial is the possible bias of the factfinder, the trial court\u2019s determination is entitled to great deference from the reviewing court. Although the mistrial was not strictly and literally necessary because \"some trial judges might have proceeded with the trial after giving the jury appropriate, cautionary instructions,\u201d the Court held that the bar to double jeopardy was lifted because of the \"overriding interest in the evenhanded administration of justice . . . .\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 511. The Court summarized its reasoning this way:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1094-6\">Neither party has a right to have his case decided by a jury which may be tainted by bias; in these circumstances, \"the public\u2019s interest in fair trials designed to end in just judgements\u201d must prevail over the defendant\u2019s \"valued right\u201d to have his trial concluded before the first jury impaneled. <em>[Arizona v Washington, </em>434 US 516.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1094-7\"><em>Washington </em>illustrates that the focus of inquiry is not the factfinder\u2019s actual capacity to be fair to the prosecutor, but the decision to grant the defendant\u2019s request,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>Ante </em>at 843-844. Whether Judge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"869\">*869</page-number>Curtis erred or not is not the proper focus of inquiry even under the manifest-necessity strand of double jeopardy. The inquiry is whether the mistrial was necessary. When possible bias is the triggering event, the declaration of necessity is within the trial court\u2019s discretion, and \"the highest degree of respect\u201d to the declaration of mistrial is accorded on review.</p>\n<p id=\"b1095-5\">Judge Curtis stated that she was recusing herself \"[t]o insure that each of the sides in this particular litigation feels that their rights are protected and that impartiality is assured . . . .\u201d While disqualification is not a step to be lightly taken, particularly when jeopardy has attached, neither Judge Curtis nor Judge Roberson was obligated to justify her recusation on the basis of the appearance of impropriety by requiring her to prove that she had a financial interest that would in fact make her partial. Assuming the applicability of the manifest necessity standard, as in <em>Washington, </em>\"the overriding interest in the evenhanded administration of justice requires that we accord the highest degree of respect to the trial judge\u2019s evaluation . . . .\u201d 434 US 511.</p>\n<p id=\"b1095-6\">vi</p>\n<p id=\"b1095-7\">The approach adopted by the lead opinion presents the obvious potential for unwarranted expansion of double jeopardy claims. Moreover, to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"870\">*870</page-number>extent it is based on a perceived need to discourage unwarranted recusations, it is misguided.</p>\n<p id=\"b1096-4\">The lead opinion\u2019s struggle with applicable authority to reach the explicit conclusion that defendant had a right to have Judge Curtis serve as his particular tribunal is based on the unexpressed premise that to permit a judge to recuse herself from a bench trial after jeopardy attaches would invite corruption. Yet the foreordained result of the lead opinion\u2019s conclusion that the defendant\u2019s interest in continuing with the particular fact-finder is superior to his interest in finality is that the defendant must go free.</p>\n<p id=\"b1096-5\">While trial judges should be wary of recusing themselves on the basis of a cynical perception of judicial integrity, we should be equally loath to discourage recusal on the basis of a good-faith belief that the circumstances are such that any ultimate verdict would be compromised. A decision that tells trial courts that, despite such a possibility, the trial must be completed on pain of the defendant going free, discourages the honest expression of reservations. Given that the interest in finality could have been accommodated, tolerating rare instances of disqualification far better serves society than repressing judicial candor, issuing compromised decisions, or turning defendants free.</p>\n<p id=\"b1096-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1096-7\">For the foregoing reasons, I would reverse the decision of the Court of Appeals and remand the case to Detroit Recorder\u2019s Court for trial.</p>\n<judges id=\"b1096-8\">Riley, J., concurred with Boyle, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1083-6\"> 1 am not participating in <em>Hicks, </em>but I believe that defendant\u2019s refusal to consent to any alternative was the \"functional equivalent\u201d of a request for a mistrial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1083-7\"> Ante at 831, n 19.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1083-8\"> See, e.g., <em>Dinitz, </em>424 US 607 (\u201c 'a motion by the defendant for a mistrial\u2019 \u201d); <em>id. </em>at 608 (\"mistrials granted at the defendant\u2019s request or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"858\">*858</page-number>with his consent\u201d).

Moreover, as subsequent authority confirms, defendant does not have a right to object to a mistrial and claim jeopardy preclusion unless the cause of the mistrial is one that could be manipulated to abort a proceeding that is not going favorably to the prosecution.
