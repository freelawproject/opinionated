While we would hold that the trial court did err, because the instructional error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt, we find no actual prejudice to defendant and, accordingly, would reverse the decision of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">i</p>\n<p id=\"b447-6\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b447-7\">On the evening of September 24, 1989, complainant and a friend met the defendant at a Flint tavern. At approximately 1:40 a.m., after sharing some drinks and dancing, defendant asked the complainant to accompany him to a local party store. Complainant agreed to the excursion and joined defendant in his car.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-8\">At the store, defendant purchased some alcohol and glasses. Returning to the car, he poured drinks for himself and complainant. After leaving the store, complainant gave defendant the address of a friend and asked to be dropped off at that location. Complainant also asked to be returned to the tavern. Disregarding these requests, defendant drove to a gas station. While defendant remained in the automobile, complainant tried to use an outside pay phone to call for a ride, but was too nervous to remember any phone numbers. Reentering the automobile, complainant repeated her request to be dropped off either at her friend\u2019s home or at the tavern.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-9\">Again disregarding complainant\u2019s plea, defendant drove to a nearby parking lot, where he rolled a marijuana cigarette. After instructing complainant to take a \"hit,\u201d defendant smoked some of the marijuana himself and then drove onto the 1-69 expressway. After again asking to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>returned either to her friend\u2019s home or the tavern, defendant told complainant that he needed to visit a friend\u2019s home. Upon learning this, complainant opened the door and tried to flee the moving vehicle. Grabbing her arm, defendant pulled the complainant back into the vehicle, slammed the door shut, and struck complainant in the head.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-5\">After traveling along the expressway for approximately twenty minutes, defendant arrived at his friend\u2019s home and began changing the oil in his car. According to complainant, this task took approximately fifteen to twenty minutes. Upon completion, defendant returned to the vehicle where he grabbed the complainant and ripped off her coat and sweater. Complainant fled from the car and began running down the road. Defendant followed in his automobile, catching up with her at a home some blocks away. Defendant got out of the vehicle, ran to the complainant, and punched her twice in the head. Defendant then grabbed complainant by the arm, lifted her off the ground, and forced her back into the car.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-6\">Defendant now drove directly to a motel. Already having a key to the room, he did not check in at the main office. Defendant told complainant that she could use the telephone in the room, but, upon entering, she discovered that the room did not have a telephone. Recognizing that she had been tricked, she tried to leave, but defendant locked the door and would not let her depart.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-7\">Defendant instructed complainant to sit on the bed and to undress, which she did. Complainant struck the defendant with an ashtray, and he responded by striking her in the face, knocking her off the bed. Defendant then threw the complainant back onto the bed and raped her. Defendant later drove the complainant to a local school where he dropped her off. According to complain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>ant, defendant left her at the school just before dawn, approximately between 5:00 and 6:00 a.m.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-6\">Defendant was charged with first-degree criminal sexual conduct, penetration occurring in connection with the commission of a felony and with the separate offense of kidnapping. The prosecutor proceeded under theories of (1) actual forcible or secret confinement, and (2) forcible confinement with intent to secretly confine complainant or hold her in service against her will. MCL 750.349; MSA 28.581; see also <em>People v </em>Wesley, 421 Mich 375, 383; 365 NW2d 692 (1984). After a lengthy jury trial, at the close of evidence, both the prosecutor and defense counsel submitted jury instructions to the trial judge. Defendant\u2019s submission was based on CJI2d 19.1, which the trial judge accepted. After instructing the juiy on both the kidnapping and first-degree esc charges, the trial judge inquired if counsel had any corrections or comments pertaining to the instructions. Both the prosecutor and defense counsel expressed agreement with the instructions given. Defendant was subsequently found guilty of both charges and, after pleading guilty of being an habitual (second) offender, was sentenced to concurrent forty- to sixty-year terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-7\">Defendant appealed and argued, inter alia, that there was insufficient evidence of the asportation element to support his convictions. Defendant did not raise in the Court of Appeals his current challenge of the jury instructions. Rejecting defendant\u2019s sufficiency of the evidence claim, the Court of Appeals concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-8\">[S]ufficient -evidence was presented so that a rational juiy could find beyond a reasonable doubt that the movement of the victim in this case was not \"merely'incidental\u201d to the sexual assault. [200 Mich App 611, 614; 505 NW2d 41 (1993).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b450-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>Notwithstanding this conclusion, the Court of Appeals went on to reverse defendant\u2019s separate kidnapping conviction because it deemed the trial court\u2019s jury instructions insufficient to convey the essential point that the asportation necessary for kidnapping could not be merely movement incidental to commission of the esc. This failure to adequately inform the jury about an essential element of kidnapping, the Court of Appeals reasoned, resulted in manifest injustice and required reversal. <em>Id. </em>at 614-617.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-5\">Because this kidnapping had served as the underlying felony for defendant\u2019s csc-i and habitual offender convictions, the Court of Appeals reversed the jury verdict on these counts as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-6\">On January 4, 1994, we granted the prosecutor\u2019s application to appeal. 444 Mich 913.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-7\">ii</p>\n<p id=\"b450-8\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b450-9\">It is well established that forcible-confinement kidnapping requires proof of asportation taken in furtherance of kidnapping and not merely movement incidental to the commission of an underlying offense. <em>Wesley, supra </em>at 388.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> This essential <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>element of asportation applies if the underlying offense is a coequal or lesser crime. See <em>People v Barker, </em>411 Mich 291; 307 NW2d 61 (1981) (coequal offenses); <em>People v Adams, </em>389 Mich 222; 205 NW2d 415 (1973) (lesser offenses) (hereinafter <em>Adams I). </em>These rules pertaining to asportation have been incorporated into both the first and the second editions of the standard Criminal Jury Instructions. See CJI 19:1:01; CJI2d 19.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">The importance of this distinction between asportation for kidnapping and movement incidental to an underlying offense cannot be overemphasized. As this Court explained in <em>Wesley, </em>because \" 'virtually any assault, any battery, any rape, or any robbery involves some \"intentional confinement,\u201d of the person of the victim,\u2019 \u201d <em>Wesley, supra </em>at 385, quoting <em>People v Adams, </em>34 Mich App 546, 560; 192 NW2d 19 (1971), a forcible confinement kidnapping charge may be used by the prosecutor to \"elevate[ J a common-law misdemeanor to an offense punishable by life imprisonment.\u201d 421 Mich 385. To avoid this potential problem, this Court has specifically demanded that the prosecution prove asportation unique to the commission of kidnapping. <em>Adams I, supra </em>at 237-238. This burden of proof, of course, means little if a jury is not informed of it. Accordingly, it is erroneous not to properly instruct regarding this essential element of asportation. Similarly, it is erroneous to instruct the jury in such a way that it may find the asportation element satisfied by movement not incidental to kidnapping but, instead, merely incidental to commission of a coequal offense such as first-degree esc. Such an instruction circumvents the express demands of <em>Adams </em>I.,, <em>Barker, </em>and <em>Wesley, </em>and exposes the kidnapping statute to potential charges of unconstitutionality. <em>Adams I, supra </em>at 237-238.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>B</p>\n<p id=\"b452-4\">It is equally well established that the criminal defendant has a right to have a properly instructed jury consider the evidence presented against him. See, e.g., <em>People v </em>Liggett, 378 Mich 706, 714; 148 NW2d 784 (1967); <em>People v Visel, </em>275 Mich 77, 81; 265 NW 781 (1936). This prerogative emanates from a criminal defendant\u2019s right under the federal and state constitutions to a fair trial by jury,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and is entrusted, as an initial matter, to the able trial judges of this state, whose general duty to properly instruct is specifically mandated by MCL 768.29; MSA 28.1052:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b452-5\">The court shall instruct the jury as to the law applicable to the case and in his charge make such comment on the evidence, the testimony and character of any witnesses, as in his opinion the interest of justice may require.[<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b453-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>Under the common law of this state, trial judges are responsible for insuring that cases are presented to juries in an intelligent manner so that the jurors have a clear and correct understanding of what it is they are to decide. See, e.g., <em>People v Martin, </em>392 Mich 553, 562; 221 NW2d 336 (1974); <em>People </em>v <em>Townes, </em>391 Mich 578, 587; 218 NW2d 136 (1974); <em>People v Allen, </em>109 Mich App 147, 158-159; 311 NW2d 734 (1981). This responsibility demands that the trial judge instruct a jury regarding the general features of a case, define the offense, and explain what must be proven to establish that offense. <em>Liggett, supra </em>at 714. Where the instruction pertains to an essential element of the charged offense, the trial judge\u2019s duty to ade7 quately instruct must be adhered to even absent a request from counsel. <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Failure to recognize these instructional responsibilities may demand reversal where an erroneous or misleading charge denies a criminal defendant the right to have a properly instructed jury consider the evidence. See <em>People v Petrella, </em>424 Mich 221, 277; 380 NW2d 11 (1985); <em>People v Pepper, </em>389 Mich 317, 322; 206 NW2d 439 (1973); <em>Visel, supra </em>at 81; <em>Liggett, supra </em>at 714; <em>People v MacPherson, </em>323 Mich 438; 35 NW2d 376 (1949).</p>\n<p id=\"b453-6\">hi</p>\n<p id=\"b453-7\">We agree with the Court of Appeals that the jury instructions given here were erroneous inso<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>far as they failed to adequately explain that forcible-confinement kidnapping demands asportation incidental to the kidnapping, and not movement merely incidental to commission of the coequal offense of first-degree esc.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-6\">We first address appellant\u2019s argument that defendant\u2019s challenge to the jury instructions is not properly before this Court because defendant did not object to the instructions at trial. This Court has recently reaffirmed the general rule that \"issues . . . not properly raised before a trial court cannot be raised on appeal absent compelling or extraordinary circumstances.\u201d <em>People </em>v Grant, 445 Mich 535, 546; 520 NW2d 123 (1994). This general rule applies specifically to alleged instructional errors occurring at trial. See, e.g., <em>People v Van Dorsten, </em>441 Mich 540, 544-545; 494 NW2d 737 (1993) (citing cases). Absent an objection to the instruction, appellate review and relief will only be granted when necessary to avoid manifest injustice to the defendant. See <em>Petrella, supra </em>at 276; <em>People v Woods, </em>416 Mich 581, 610; 331 NW2d 707 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b454-7\">However, it is aiso well established in our jurisprudence that where an erroneous jury instruction pertains to an essential element of an offense, a contemporaneous objection to the instruction is <em>not </em>required to preserve the issue for appeal. See, e.g., <em>Liggett, supra </em>at 714 (failure to object or request a correct instruction pertaining to the identity of defendant); see also <em>Allen, supra </em>at 159; <em>People v Ashford, </em>91 Mich App 693; 283 NW2d 830 (1979); <em>People v Price, 21 </em>Mich App 694, 697-698; 176 NW2d 426 (1970). Accordingly, while defendant admittedly failed to object to those instruc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>tions ultimately given by the trial judge, because defendant\u2019s present appeal goes directly to that portion of the jury instructions that pertain to asportation\u2014i.e., an essential element of forcible-confinement kidnapping\u2014his failure to object at trial does not preclude appellate review of the instructional issue raised here.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b455-6\">At the conclusion of trial, defense counsel submitted and requested a standard criminal jury instruction for kidnapping.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Defendant\u2019s request was based on CJI2d 19.1, the model instruction for kidnapping where an underlying offense other than murder, extortion, or hostage-taking has also been charged. This standard jury instruction reads, in pertinent part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-7\">Third, that while he was confining [name complainant], the defendant forcibly moved or caused [name complainant] to be moved from one place to another for the purpose of kidnapping. <em>If </em>[name complainant] <em>was moved as part of a crime other </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number><em>than kidnapping, this is not enough. </em>In this case, for instance, you should consider whether [name complainant] was moved for the purpose of kidnapping or as part of the crime of__In determining whether [name complainant] was moved for the purpose of kidnapping, you may consider how far [name complainant] was moved and whether being moved added any greater danger or threat to [name complainant] than the crime of__[Name complainant] <em>must have been moved for the purpose of kidnapping and this movement must have been independent of the other crime. </em>[CJI2d 19.1(4). Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b456-8\">Accepting this proffered instruction, the trial judge instructed the jurors regarding the penetration-related elements of esc and accurately explained the requirement that sexual penetration be shown to have occurred in connection with the commission of a kidnapping. The trial judge then gave a simple description of kidnapping,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and concluded with the following specific instructions on the elements of kidnapping as a separate offense:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-9\">These are the elements the prosecution must prove beyond a reasonable doubt: First, that the victim as described here must have been forcibly confined or imprisoned; second, the victim must have been so confined or imprisoned against her will and without lawful authority; next, during the course of such confinement the defendant must have forcibly moved or caused the victim to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>moved from one place to another for the purpose of abduction and kidnapping.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-5\">In determining whether or not the movement was for the purpose of kidnapping, you may consider whether the movement was for a few feet or for a substantia] distance, that at the time of the confinement the defendant must have intended to kidnap the victim; next, at the time of the confinement the defendant must have been acting willfully and maliciously, willfully and maliciously meaning the defendant intentionally confined the victim knowing such confinement to be wrong, and that he did so without legal justification or ex-cuseF [<footnotemark>8</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b458-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>Jury instructions are reviewed as a whole rather than examined piecemeal to establish error. <em>People v </em>Watkins, 178 Mich App 439, 450; 444 NW2d 201 (1989), rev\u2019d on other grounds 438 Mich 627; 475 NW2d 727 (1991). Even if somewhat imperfect, there is no error if the instructions fairly presented the issues to be tried and sufficiently protected the defendant\u2019s rights. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">In this case, the instruction given almost completely failed to introduce or explain that, for purposes of forcible-confinement kidnapping, the essential element of asportation must be based on movement incidental to kidnapping and not merely movement incidental to the underlying offense of first-degree esc. While the trial judge\u2019s instructions were ostensibly based on a standard criminal jury instruction for kidnapping and an underlying offense,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> they in fact omitted the following fundamental language referring to the distinction between asportation incidental to kidnapping versus movement incidental to the underlying offense:</p>\n<p id=\"b458-6\"><em>Eliminated </em>from CJI 19:1:01 (the instruction actually used):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-7\">(4) . . . Such movement is not sufficient if it is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>part of a crime other than kidnapping. In this case, for instance, you should consider whether the movement was for the purpose of kidnapping or whether it was a part of the crime of_ [or crimes of_and_].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-8\">(5) . . . However, the evidence must convince you beyond a reasonable doubt that there was movement independent of the other crime and that it was for the purpose of kidnapping.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b459-9\"><em>Eliminated </em>from CJI2d 19.1 (the instruction requested by defense counsel):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-10\">Third . . . [i]f [name complainant] was moved as part of a crime other than kidnapping, this is not enough. In this case, for instance, you should consider whether [name complainant] was moved for the purpose of kidnapping or as part of the crime of-___ . . [Name complainant] must have been moved for the purpose of kidnapping and this movement must have been independent of the other crime.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b459-13\">These are the only direct references in CJI and CJI2d to the essential distinction between asportation incidental to kidnapping versus movement incidental to the underlying offense. Importantly, the remaining two instructions concerning asportation<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> only identify the necessity of asportation intended for kidnapping; <em>these instructions do not explain to the jury that this asportation must not be merely incidental to commission of the underlying offense.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b459-14\">Jury instructions must fairly and adequately <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>apprise the jury of those elements that must be proven, in a criminal case. Asportation is an essential element of a forcible-confinement kidnapping charge, <em>Wesley, supra </em>at 388, and, accordingly, was also a central issue in the instant criminal action. By giving an otherwise standard instruction that eliminated the only language adequately describing asportation, the trial judge effectively eradicated from jury consideration <em>all </em>guidance designed to assist the jury in properly assessing the asportation requirement. Notably, while these deletions were not error per se,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> the trial judge did not replace the expunged information with clear or more accurate instructions and, in fact, gave no substitute instructions regarding asportation.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">The practical consequence of the instructions given here was that the jurors did not have a \"clear and correct understanding of what it is they are to decide.\u201d See, e.g., <em>Martin, supra </em>at 562. Specifically, it was never explained to the jurors that they had to find asportation incidental to kidnapping and not movement merely incidental to the commission of esc. By failing to make clear this distinction, the trial judge in effect permitted jurors to find the asportation element satisfied by movement merely incidental to the commission of esc. This instruction was incomplete and misleading, and did not adequately explain what must be proven to establish the offense of kidnapping. <em>Liggett, supra </em>at 714; <em>Barker, supra </em>at 301.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> By failing to adequately instruct on this essential <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>element of kidnapping, the trial judge denied defendant his right to have a properly instructed jury consider all the evidence presented against him. <em>Liggett, supra </em>at 714; <em>Visel, supra </em>at 81.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b461-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b461-7\">While we agree with the Court of Appeals that the failure to properly instruct on asportation was error, and that it was not forfeited, the question remains whether this error resulted in prejudice to defendant to the extent that a miscarriage of justice occurred requiring reversal. We turn now to this dispositive issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-8\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b461-9\">This Court first explained in Woods, supra, that an erroneous instruction regarding an essential element of a criminal offense per se does not mandate a rule of reversal. Specifically, we held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-10\">A per se harmless error rule cannot be justified by quoting the general rule from cases such as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number><em>People v Visel, </em>275 Mich 77, 81; 265 NW 781 (1936), that a \"[djefendant has a right to have a [properly instructed] jury pass upon the evidence.\u201d <em>Whether an instruction is reversible depends on whether it was prejudicial, </em>and no reasoning or case law suggests that we should now discard that sound approach. <em>[Id. </em>at 600-601. Emphasis added.][<footnotemark>14</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">This emphasis on actual prejudice derives directly from Michigan\u2019s \"harmless error\u201d statute, which provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b462-6\">No judgment or verdict shall be set aside or reversed or a new trial be granted by any court of this state in any criminal case, <em>on the ground of misdirection of the juiy . . </em>. unless in the opinion of the court, <em>after an examination of the entire cause, </em>it shall affirmatively appear that the error complained of <em>has resulted in a miscarriage of justice. </em>[MCL 769.26; MSA 28.1096. Emphasis added .][<footnotemark>15</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b463-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>Relying on our decision in <em>Wesley, </em>the Court of Appeals concluded that\u2014despite the existence of evidence sufficient for a rational jury to find the movement of complainant not \"merely incidental\u201d to the commission of esc\u2014the instructional error here created manifest injustice requiring reversal. 200 Mich App 617. By neglecting any analysis of prejudice or harmless error, the Court of Appeals in effect created a rule of reversal per se for the instructional error that occurred here. Notably, however, this Court has recently reaffirmed the \"harmless error\u201d approach taken in <em>Woods </em>and MCL 769.26; MSA 28.1096, and rejected an automatic reversal rule for erroneous jury instructions on nonessential elements. Specifically, in <em>Grant, supra, </em>we explained that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b463-6\">the failure to give a preliminary instruction on insanity does not require automatic reversal for several reasons. First, automatic reversal would come into direct conflict with MCL 769.26; MSA 28.1096, which orders that judgments or verdicts shall not be reversed absent a miscarriage of justice. . . . Second, other important concerns <em>such as proper iinal histructions to the jury are the subject of harmless-error analysis and are therefore not susceptible to automatic reversal. </em>Absent a. clear legislative directive, we camiot consider the preliminary jury instruction involved here to avoid the more generalized requirement that no judgment or verdict may be reversed absent a miscarriage of justice. <em>[Id. </em>at 543. Emphasis added.J[<footnotemark>16</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b463-7\">We would reaffirm the general approach to in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>structional error articulated in MCL 769.26; MSA 28.1096, <em>Woods, </em>and <em>Grant, </em>and would reject an automatic reversal rule for erroneous jury instructions regarding an essential element of a criminal offense. Specifically, we reiterate that erroneous jury instructions regarding essential elements may be reviewed for harmless error by utilizing a \"prejudice\u201d standard. In the context of an erroneous jury instruction on an essential element, this standard demands that the court assess whether the jury, properly instructed, could have reached a different verdict had the error not occurred.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b465-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>Turning now to the facts of this case, we conclude that because of the overwhelming and unrefuted record evidence indicating that most of complainant\u2019s involuntary confinement and asportation was incidental to kidnapping, and not movement merely for purposes of committing first-degree esc, no actual prejudice resulted from the instructional error that occurred here. Accordingly, we would hold that the error was harmless.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b466-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>B</p>\n<p id=\"b466-4\">While complainant initially agreed to accompany defendant for a short trip to a nearby store, the extent of her consent was expressly limited to this brief excursion. Upon his return from the store, complainant made clear to defendant that she no longer wished to accompany him. On numerous occasions thereafter complainant asked defendant to take her to a friend\u2019s home or, alternatively, to return her to the tavern. Defendant refused or ignored each of these requests. Further, complainant tried to telephone for an alternate ride and, on at least two occasions, attempted to physically escape only to be forcibly and violently returned by defendant to the automobile. While the record is not precisely clear on duration and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>distance, it does appear that complainant was involuntarily and forcibly confined to defendant\u2019s vehicle for a period approximating between one and two hours and for a distance covering many miles.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-4\">Similarly, the facts establish that, before forcibly taking complainant to the motel where he eventually raped her, defendant drove complainant to a gas station, to a parking lot, and to a friend\u2019s home for purposes of changing the oil in his car. During this time, defendant consumed both alcohol and marijuana, fraying his senses to such a degree that, according to complainant, he almost struck a telephone pole with his automobile.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">From these facts, we derive two conclusions. First, given the nature and duration of complainant\u2019s forcible confinement in defendant\u2019s automobile, no properly instructed juror in this case could have interpreted the facts as indicating asportation merely incidental to first-degree CSC. Defendant\u2019s various stops at a gas station, a parking lot, and a friend\u2019s home\u2014all <em>before </em>moving complainant to the motel where the rape eventually occurred\u2014clearly deviated from any sort of asportation that, on the facts here, could be considered necessary or only incidental to the commission of first-degree esc.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Further, defendant cer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>tainly did <em>not </em>have to confine complainant in his automobile for approximately one to two hours and many miles in order to later execute this heinous rape in a local motel room.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">In fact, had defendant intended to confine and move complainant solely for the purposes of committing rape, he could have driven directly to the motel. Complainant\u2019s forcible confinement to defendant\u2019s vehicle <em>was </em>asportation incidental exclusively'to kidnapping, and no juror examining this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>record evidence against the backdrop of proper instructions on asportation could have concluded otherwise.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b469-6\">Second, defendant\u2019s extended asportation of complainant added greater dangers, both actual and threatened, beyond those inherent to a criminal sexual assault. Defendant\u2019s consumption of alcohol and marijuana while operating his vehicle on local roads and a highway significantly increased the likelihood that complainant, and perhaps others, would be involved in a traffic accident. Further, by driving complainant away from alternative crime locations where observation by others was more likely (i.e., the party store, the gas station, the parking lot, and his friend\u2019s home), and to an isolated motel room where the probability of detection was remote and where isolation substantially increased the risk of harm to complainant if she tried to defend herself or escape, defendant placed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>complainant in greater danger than she otherwise would have been had the crime occurred elsewhere.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> In short, defendant\u2019s irresponsible actions incidental to this kidnapping substantially increased the risk of harm to complainant beyond that otherwise incidental to the rape.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> The exis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>tence of these additional dangers counsels our conclusion that no juror, properly instructed, could determine that complainant\u2019s asportation was solely incidental to first-degree esc.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">c</p>\n<p id=\"b471-6\">We conclude, therefore, that the crime of forcible-confinement kidnapping both preceded and was complete well before defendant duped complainant into entering his motel room.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Defendant\u2019s forcible confinement of complainant in his vehicle was beyond a reasonable doubt incidental to the commission of kidnapping. It is clear from these facts that no juror, properly instructed, could have concluded that the extended confinement here was merely incidental to commission of esc. Accordingly, it is also clear that defendant was not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>prejudiced by the erroneous jury instruction and, therefore, that the trial court\u2019s instructional error was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">For these reasons, the Court of Appeals decision should be reversed and the jury verdict reinstated.</p>\n<judges id=\"b472-6\">Mallett, J., concurred with Brickley, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b450-10\"> Specifically, forcible confinement kidnapping requires that the prosecutor prove four elements beyond a reasonable doubt:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-11\">1) a forcible confinement of another within the state,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-12\"><em>2) </em>done wilfully, maliciously and without lawful authority,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-13\">3) against the will of the person confined or imprisoned, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-14\">4) an asportation of the victim which is not merely incidental to an underlying crime <em>unless </em>the crime involves murder, extortion or taking a hostage.

See <em>Woods, supra </em>at 600 (\"The circumstances of |two prior cases| were examined to determine if the erroneous instructions were on elements essentia/ to those cases, i.e., was the instruction <em>prejudicial </em>to that defendant? Thus, the traditional harmless error analysis was applied\u201d) (emphasis added and in original); <em>People v Robinson, </em>386 Mich 551, 562; 194 NW2d 709 (1972) (explaining that the \"manifest injustice\u201d requirement is simply a requirement for showing prejudice, articulating two-pronged test for harmless error); <em>People v Nichols, </em>341 Mich 311, 332; 67 NW2d 230 (1954) (\"the rule always in effect in Michigan . . . has been and is that the question of reversal is controlled by determination of whether the error was prejudicial\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b462-9\">Kecently, this Court recognized that the <em>Robinson </em>two-part inquiry is strikingly similar to the federal constitutional test announced in <em>Chapman </em>v <em>California, </em>386 US 18; 87 S Ct 824; 17 L Ed 2d 705 (1967), and <em>Arizona </em>v <em>Fulminante, </em>499 US 279; 111 S Ct 1246; 113 L Ed 2d 302 (1991), but determined that the test applies to constitutional, not nonconstitutional, errors. Having carefully considered this multitude of Michigan case law, we believe our articulation of harmless error herein to be manifestly consistent with these prior decisions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b463-8\"> Again, we recognize that the instant case is markedly different from <em>Grant, supra, </em>and <em>Anderson, supra, </em>insofar as it involves an error with constitutional implications that is not subject to traditional preservation requirements. Nevertheless, we note that \u00e1 \"prejudice\u201d standard for harmless error is well established in Michigan law for assessing instructional infirmities pertaining to an essential element of a criminal offense. Like the Court in <em>Woods, </em>we see \"no reasoning <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>or case law [to] suggest . . . that we should now discard that sound approach.\u201d <em>Woods, supra </em>at 601. Because a rule of automatic reversal is antithetical to this admittedly ''sound approach,\u201d like the Court in <em>Grant </em>we find significant merit for rejecting it here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b464-7\"> Insofar as the instructional error here violated defendant\u2019s federal constitutional rights, see n 2, we note that our harmless error standard for constitutional error squares with that approach taken by our brethren in the federal courts. As this Court recently explained in <em>Anderson, </em>n 2 <em>supra </em>at 404-407, the United States Supreme Court has enunciated a two-part harmless error inquiry for constitutional infirmities. This test is discussed below.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-8\">Under <em>Arizona v Fulminante, </em>n 15 <em>supra, </em>a court must first determine whether a harmless error analysis is even applicable to the constitutional violation. In this regard, the <em>Fulminante </em>Court has distinguished between \"trial errors\u201d and \"structural errors.\u201d Trial errors, involve \"error which occurred during the presentation of the case to the jury, and which may therefore be quantitatively assessed in the context of other evidence presented in order to determine whether its admission was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 307-308. Conversely, structural errors \"are structural defects in the constitution of the triad mechanism, which defy analysis by 'harmless-error\u2019 standards.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 309. The key point, for purposes of the instant case, is that constitutionally-infirm instructional error was categorized in <em>Fulminante </em>as generally being \"trial error\u201d subject to harmless-error analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-9\">Notably, this categorization is consistent with other United States Supreme Court cases addressing instructional error. See <em>Sullivan v Louisiana, </em>508 US \u2014; 113 S Ct 2078; 124 L Ed 2d 182, 190 (1993) (an erroneous \"reasonable doubt\u201d instruction demanded reversal because instruction implicated the entire jury verdict; however, the Court affirmed <em>Rose v Clark, </em>478 US 570, 579; 106 S Ct 3101; 92 L Ed 2d 460 [1986], and intimated that jury instructions generally remain subject to harmless-error analysis as \"trial errors\u201d); <em>Pope v Illinois, </em>481 US 497, 503; 107 S Ct 1918; 95 L Ed 2d 439 (1987) (the Court concluded that \"if a reviewing court concludes that no rational juror, if properly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>instructed, could [conclude otherwise], the convictions should stand\u201d); <em>Rose, supra </em>at 579 (the Court concluded that while a jury instruction was unconstitutional, in absence of error rendering trial fundamentally unfair\u2014such as the denial of the right to counsel or trial before a financially interested judge\u2014the conviction should be affirmed \"[w]here a reviewing court can find that the record developed at trial establishes guilt beyond a reasonable doubt\u201d). See also <em>Chapman v California, </em>n 15 <em>supra </em>(general proposition that constitutional errors do not automatically require reversal of a conviction).</p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">Second, and assuming that the infirmity is a \"trial error\u201d subject to harmless-error analysis, the beneficiary of this error must prove \"beyond a reasonable doubt that there is no ' \"reasonable possibility that the evidence complained of might have contributed to the conviction.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>Anderson, </em>n 2 <em>supra </em>at 406 (quoting <em>Chapman, </em>n 15 <em>supra </em>at 23).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b465-6\"> The concurring opinion explains that \"[i]f the facts, as alleged, \u25a0 are found by the jury to have occurred beyond a reasonable doubt, the movement is, as a matter of law, not merely incidental to a separate, coequal charge of forcible-confinement, false-imprisonment kidnapping.\u201d <em>Post </em>at 247. From this premise, the opinion ultimately concludes that\u2014because the jury found asportation facts sufficient to support a kidnapping conviction\u2014it was not error to exclude those instructions that directed the jury to find this asportation independent of any movement incidental to commission of esc. I disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-7\">The rationale upon which this concurring opinion proceeds\u2014i.e., juror factfinding on asportation sufficient to convict of kidnapping\u2014is an approach based fundamentally on <em>postinstruction </em>jury proceedings. While under the microscope of retrospective analysis it may accurately be said that the jury found facts sufficient for conviction, and that it properly applied these facts to reach a kidnapping conviction, it is certainly accurate that the deliberative process that resulted in both the facts and the verdict is one significantly directed by jury instructions. Facts are neither deduced nor applied in a vacuum. The deliberative process of a jury sails fundamentally with the winds of a trial judge\u2019s instructions. To say, therefore, that a jury\u2019s ultimate factual conclusions justify a prior instructional decision ignores the simple truth that the jury\u2019s findings may have been prejudicially affected <em>by that decision. </em>The end does not justify the means. Facts and verdicts procured under the spectre of prior instructional error <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>cannot be, and should not be, later inverted to sanction that error. Such an intrinsically circular approach is taken by the concurring opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-6\">Seldom are the implications of instructional error more <em>potentially </em>prejudicial than in those cases in which the prosecutor proceeds under the approach utilized in the instant case. Here, the prosecutor charged defendant with both kidnapping and esc. Kidnapping was used to elevate the second charge to csc-i. To convict under both counts, the prosecutor had to <em>\u00f1rst </em>prove kidnapping; without a valid kidnapping conviction, csc-i was legally impossible. While the charges are therefore separate, the factual basis and legal conclusions for the first (kidnapping) must have been deduced before the second (csc-i) could even be considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-7\">Potential difficulties arise, however, where the kidnapping and esc charges are based inextricably on a continuous set of facts. If a jury must find kidnapping as a prerequisite to convicting of csc-i, it must also be instructed to first separate out from the collective offense those facts necessary for a preliminary kidnapping analysis. The necessity for distinct fact finding and analysis is conveyed to a jury via instructions such as CJI 19:1:01 and CJI2d 19.1. Such instructions inform the jury to not \"mix\u201d facts when arriving at a kidnapping determination\u2014to separate any asportation incidental to the esc, and only consider that movement incidental to kidnapping. Lack of such an instruction, even on \"clear\u201d facts such as these, permits jurors to mix their analysis for determinations, which, by definition, must otherwise be kept separate. In effect, the jury is permitted to do that which the <em>Adams </em>Court sought to prevent prosecutors from accomplishing: convicting defendants for two offenses in cases in which the facts only support one.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b467-6\"> At least three foreign courts have considered a defendant\u2019s superfluous movement of a esc victim as one factor to be considered in determining if a kidnapping conviction is valid. See, e.g., <em>United States v Peden, </em>961 F2d 517 (CA 5, 1992) (the defendant\u2019s asportation of the victim away from the area where they initially met, and subsequent detention of the victim for half an hour, went beyond that necessarily inherent in rape and supported the kidnapping conviction); <em>Daniels v State, </em>274 Ind 29; 408 NE2d 1244 (1980) (a separate kidnapping conviction was proper where the defendant drove the rape victim around back roads without her consent and where the victim finally had to escape by jumping from the vehicle); <em>State v Newman, </em>326 NW2d 788 (Iowa, 1982) (the kidnapping conviction was valid where the defendant transported the victim several miles to various places, used physical force on at least two occasions to thwart escape <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>efforts, and threatened the victim before actually raping her). These cases are cited for purposes of illustration only. Nothing in this citation shall be construed as indicating that this Court has adopted the findings\u2014asportation or otherwise\u2014of these foreign courts.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b468-7\"> Numerous foreign courts have considered the distance and duration of a esc victim as one factor to be considered in determining if a kidnapping conviction is valid. See, e.g., <em>State v Perry, </em>116 Ariz App 40; 567 P2d 786 (1977) (the record supported the conviction of armed rape and armed kidnapping where the defendant refused to let the complainant out of his car and drove her out of town before committing rape); <em>People v Neal, </em>37 Ill App 3d 713; 346 NE2d 178 (1976) (the kidnapping conviction was proper where the victim was forcibly confined to the automobile for two and one-half hours before being raped); <em>People v Henderson, </em>36 Ill App 3d 355; 344 NE2d 239 (1976) (a separate kidnapping conviction was valid where the victim was confined in a vehicle for at least an hour); <em>People v D\u2019Angelo, </em>166 AD2d 662; 561 NYS2d 83 (1990) (the kidnapping and rape convictions were proper where the defendants drove the victim for several hours before committing rape); <em>State v Williams, </em>308 NC 339; 302 SE2d 441 (1983) (a separate conviction for kidnapping was proper where the defendant restrained the victim for several hours in her home before committing rape); <em>State v Swaggerty, </em>15 Or App 343; 515 P2d 952 (1973) (the asportation was sufficiently extensive to support kidnapping where the defendant drove away with the victim, later returned and changed vehicles, and drove to two motels before committing rape); <em>State v Taylor, </em>562 A2d 445 (RI, 1989) (where the defendant removed the child from her home and asportated the victim several houses away, prosecution for kidnapping and sexual assault was proper because the movement was more than otherwise necessary to commit sexual assault); <em>State v St Cloud, </em>465 NW2d 177 (SD, 1991) (the prosecution for both rape and kidnapping was proper where the defendant forced the victim to drive five miles to an isolated area before raping her); <em>State v Trail, </em>174 W Va 656; 328 SE2d 671 (1985) (the defendant could be convicted of both kidnapping and rape where he led the victim three miles into the woods before raping her). Again, these cases are cited for purposes of illustration only. Nothing herein shall be construed as indicating that this Court has adopted the findings\u2014asportation or otherwise\u2014of these foreign courts.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b469-7\"> Again, we note that our harmless error standard, and the conclusion it necessitates here, are consistent with federal court precedent. See <em>Rose, </em>n 17 <em>supra, Pope, </em>n 17 <em>supra. </em>Like the United States Supreme Court in <em>Fulminante, </em>n 15 <em>supra, </em>and <em>Sullivan, </em>n 17 <em>supra, </em>we appraise the instructional error that occurred here to be a \"trial error\u201d susceptible to harmless-error analysis. However, unlike the instructional error in <em>Sullivan, </em>which involved the decision-making process of the jury generally and, accordingly, which invalidated all its findings and conclusions, the erroneous instruction given here simply involved an element of the criminal offense. Therefore, the erroneous lack of instruction given in this case says little or nothing about the jury\u2019s factfinding or deliberative processes generally. See <em>Sullivan, </em>n 17 <em>supra, </em>124 L Ed 2d 190.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-8\">Further, and as alluded to by the Court in <em>Sullivan, </em>the error that occurred here was more akin to that challenged in <em>Rose, </em>n 17 <em>supra. </em>While the jury in <em>Rose </em>was erroneously instructed to presume malice from predicate facts, it still had to find the existence of those underlying facts beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Sullivan, </em>n 17 <em>supra, </em>124 L Ed 2d 190. Similarly, to find defendant guilty of kidnapping, the jury in this case had to (and did) conclude that some fact of asportation had actually taken place. The finding of this predicate fact (asportation generally) is, <em>given the unique facts of this case, </em>so closely linked to' the ultimate fact (separate asportation) that the jury\u2019s finding of asportation is, we believe, the \"functional equivalent\u201d of a finding of separate asportation. <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b470-6\"> At least four foreign decisions have considered the effect that a defendant\u2019s actions had upon the level of danger to which a esc victim was exposed.

I concur in the result reached by the lead opinion, reversing the decision of the Court of Appeals. I write separately because the lead opinion, like the majority of the panel of the Court of Appeals, erroneously assumes that every charge of forcible-confinement kidnapping necessarily requires inclusion of the \"merely incidental asportation\u201d requirement articulated for the guidance of trial judges by the committee on standard jury instructions for criminal cases. Our precedent does not require the prosecution to prove a negative, that is, that movement was not merely incidental to another crime. What is required is proof of a positive act that is not \"merely incidental\u201d to another offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-8\">There was no error in the trial judge\u2019s instruction to the jury in this case. The judge instructed the jury on the duty to find that the prosecution had proven all the essential elements of both forcible-confinement, false-imprisonment kidnapping and first-degree criminal sexual conduct beyond a reasonable doubt, including the requirement under the kidnapping charge that the victim be forcibly moved for the purpose of kidnapping. As has been ably pointed out by the lead opinion, if such asportation element was found to be proven to the satisfaction of the jury, as it was, the movement was more than just incidental to the commission of esc, and established that \"the crime of forcible-confinement kidnapping both preceded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>and was complete well before defendant duped complainant into entering his motel\u201d where the commission of the esc occurred. <em>Ante </em>at 245.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">Where two crimes charged are coequal offenses, and it is beyond question that any movement proven was extensive and occurred well in advance of the commission of the esc, the concerns that dictate the instruction that the jury find an asportation not merely incidental to an underlying crime<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> are not present. If the proofs of the prosecution and the charge to the jury require a finding of a significant movement for the purpose of abduction and kidnapping, there is no error in tailoring the standard jury instruction and choosing not to give the \"merely incidental\u201d language to the jury. If the facts, as alleged, are found by the jury to have occurred beyond a reasonable doubt, the movement is, as a matter of law, not merely incidental to a separate, coequal charge of forcible-confinement, false-imprisonment kidnapping.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-6\">i</p>\n<p id=\"b473-7\">This Court first engrafted the asportation requirement onto forcible-confinement kidnapping in <em>People v Adams, </em>389 Mich 222, 230; 205 NW2d 415 (1973), in order to distinguish the common-law misdemeanor of false imprisonment and prevent overcharging.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In that case, we also adopted the rule from New York and California jurisprudence that \"the movement element must not be merely incidental to the commission of a lesser underlying <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>crime, i.e., it must be incidental to the commission of the kidnapping.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 236. The asportation element and incidental asportation rule were adopted to provide an alternative to true movement and were \" 'designed to prevent gross distortion of lesser crimes into a much more serious crime by excess of prosecutorial zeal.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 232, quoting <em>People v Miles, </em>23 NY2d 527, 540; 297 NYS2d 913; 245 NE2d 688 (1969). In discussing the rationale for New York\u2019s version of the incidental asportation rule, the Court of Appeals of that state explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-5\">[I]n any robbery, there is a restraint of \"false imprisonment\u201d and in every rape there is a similar restraint and often removal in some limited sense. It is this kind of factual merger with the ultimate crime of the preliminary, preparatory, or concurrent action that the rule is designed to recognize, and thus prevent unnatural elevation of the \"true\u201d crime to be charged. <em>[Id. </em>at 539.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b474-6\">The New York court went on to caution, however, that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-7\">the Levy-Lombardi[<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>] [incidental asportation] rule was designed to prevent gross distortion of lesser crimes into a much more serious crime by excess of prosecutorial zeal. <em>It was not designed to merge \"true\u201d kidnappings into other crimes merely because the kidnappings were used to accomplish ultimate crimes of lesser or equal or greater gravity. Moreover, it is the rare kidnapping that is an end in itself; almost invariably there is another ultimate crime. </em>[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b474-8\">In the present case, the facts presented by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>prosecution and accepted by the jury do not present the kind of factual merger or preparatory action that requires a merely incidental instruction to guard against overcharging. The kidnapping that occurred was a \"true\u201d kidnapping, committed and completed before the esc, although used to accomplish the ultimate crime of sexual assault.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b475-4\">In <em>People v Barker, </em>411 Mich 291, 296; 307 NW2d 61 (1981), the Court expanded the incidental asportation rule of <em>Adams </em>to apply when two coequal offenses are charged. The issue in <em>Barker </em>was whether it was proper to affirmatively instruct the jury that it could satisfy the asportation element necessary for kidnapping by finding movement \"merely\u201d incidental to another offense when the punishment for both offenses was equal. While the Court did not focus on whether the crime charged was forcible-confinement kidnapping as it did in <em>Adams,</em><footnotemark><em>5</em></footnotemark><em> </em>we again acknowledged that asportation was an alternative to other forms of kidnapping, <em>id. </em>at 298, and we again addressed the possibility of \"excessive prosecutorial zeal.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In <em>Barker, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>the manifestation of that zeal was the possibility that a prosecutor could transform one offense into two by using the incidental movement from one coequal charge to fulfill the asportation requirement of a second offense of kidnapping.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b477-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>However, while it is error to instruct the jury that movement incidental to committing another offense <em>satisfies </em>the asportation element, it does not follow, as the Court of Appeals concluded, that the words \"asportation . . . not merely incidental to\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> must always be given.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-5\">In <em>People v Wesley, </em>421 Mich 375, 391; 365 NW2d 692 (1984), we observed that the asportation requirement is applicable only to false-imprisonment kidnapping, not to the other forms of kidnapping incorporated in the Michigan statute. We explained that the interpolation of asportation as an element is not required for other forms of kidnapping because the elements of those other forms do not present the danger of overcharging or inappropriate punishment.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> We specifically held, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>for example, that no movement is needed to establish the offense of forcible confinement with intent to secretly confine because the required element of a purpose to cause such secret confinement served to avoid any overbreadth concerns. <em>Id. </em>at 389-390.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">As is apparent, the purpose of the inclusion of the asportation element and incidental asportation rule in forcible-confinement, false-imprisonment kidnapping is to (1) prevent the literal application of the kidnapping statute to sweep so broadly as to allow the improper elevation of lesser crimes to capital offenses, and (2) guard against the use of movement incidental to another coequal offense, charged along with kidnapping, to fulfill the movement requirement of forcible-confinement kidnapping to improperly present the prosecution with two opportunities to convict the defendant of a capital offense, instead of one.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-6\">. ii</p>\n<p id=\"b478-7\">Our concern in the present case is not with the first danger. The jury was instructed that asportation was an element of kidnapping that had to be found beyond a reasonable doubt, and there has been no suggestion that a lesser crime, such as assault, has been surreptitiously elevated to a capital offense by allowing some incidental movement to satisfy the asportation requirement. The danger then, if any, presented by the absence of a \"merely incidental\u201d asportation instruction, is the possible use by the jury of movement incidental to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>the coequal charge of esc to fulfill the asportation element of the kidnapping offense. As is true of the first possible hazard, on these facts, any such peril is nonexistent.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-4\">Evidence of extensive movement was presented at trial. According to testimony of the complainant,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> she joined the defendant voluntarily at approximately 1:40 a.m. They then proceeded to a party store to purchase alcohol, a gas station to make a phone call, and a parking lot to smoke marijuana. The complainant testified that she was no longer accompanying the defendant willingly after leaving the party store, that she tried to flee the moving vehicle once and was struck by the defendant before arriving at his friend\u2019s home, that she later fled down the road from the friend\u2019s home, and that defendant caught her, struck her, and forced her back into the car, all before proceeding to the motel where the sexual assault occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">While this testimony did not absolve the prosecutor of the duty to prove the element of movement for the purpose of kidnapping beyond a reasonable doubt, it did present ample evidence of movement independent of the ultimate commission of esc.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Indeed, the evidence is so overwhelming that the lead opinion finds that \u201d[c]omplainant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>forcible confinement to defendant\u2019s vehicle <em>was </em>asportation incidental exclusively to kidnapping, and no juror examining this record evidence against the backdrop of proper instructions on asportation could have concluded otherwise.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 242-243 (emphasis in original). The question, of course, is why, if there was such movement, it was error to eliminate the merely incidental language from the proposed standard jury instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-5\">The jury was instructed that \"the defendant must have forcibly moved or caused the victim to be moved from one place to another for the purpose of abduction and kidnapping.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> This asportation <em>for </em>the purpose of kidnapping is the essential element the jury must find, not asportation <em>not merely incidental to </em>another offense charged. See <em>Adams </em>and <em>Barker, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b480-6\">Although \"[jjurors are the sole judges of the facts and neither the trial court nor this court can interfere with their exercise of that right,\u201d <em>People v Miller, </em>301 Mich 93, 100; 3 NW2d 23 (1942), where the proofs as presented indicate completed offenses, it is <em>not </em>a usurpation of the jury\u2019s function for the trial court to charge movement for the purpose of kidnapping. Where the proofs raise no question of fact or law regarding whether a false-imprisonment kidnapping is merely incidental to another crime, an instruction that the jury must find forcible movement for the purpose of kidnapping is a correct statement of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-7\">Under the particular facts of a given case, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>dangers that require the instruction that the asportation element be found independent of its occurrence in the commission of another crime are absent. In the present case, the jury found asportation beyond a reasonable doubt on the basis of evidence presented by the prosecution that the lead opinion accurately characterizes as \"overwhelming and unrefuted record evidence indicating that most of complainant\u2019s involuntary confinement and asportation was incidental to kidnapping, and not movement merely for purposes of committing first-degree esc . . . .\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 239. In short, if the jury was sufficiently convinced that the evidence presented at trial proved the element of asportation, this finding precluded concern that such evidence could be incidental to another coequal charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-5\">In the present case, an experienced trial court judge correctly recognized that because of the absence of the danger guarded against by the incidental asportation rule, the standard jury instruction was inapplicable and properly tailored the standard instruction to conform to the proofs in a form that clearly charged the elements that must be found beyond a reasonable doubt.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Any incidental asportation instruction was superfluous, potentially confusing, and properly eliminated.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-6\">hi</p>\n<p id=\"b481-7\">Movement is a necessary element of forcible-confinement, false-imprisonment kidnapping, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>the judge properly instructed the jury in respect to that fact. If such asportation was found on the facts presented at trial, however, there existed no reason for concern regarding the possibility of elevating a. lesser offense to a capital crime or borrowing asportation incidental to another offense to satisfy that element of the kidnapping charge. Because the jury was correctly instructed, I agree that the Court of Appeals decision should be reversed and the jury\u2019s verdict should be reinstated.</p>\n<judges id=\"b482-5\">Riley and Griffin, JJ., concurred with Boyle, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b473-8\"> Except in the case of murder, extortion, or taking a hostage.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b473-9\"> We have previously held that the addition of the asportation element is only necessary to cure constitutional infirmities in the forcible-confinement, portion of our kidnapping statute, not those sections regarding secret confinement, forcible seizure, or forcible confinement with intent to secretly confine. <em>People v Wesley, </em>421 Mich 375, 391; 365 NW2d 692 (1984).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b474-9\"><em> People v Levy, </em>15 NY2d 159; 256 NYS2d 793; 204 NE2d 842 (1965); <em>People v Lombardi, </em>20 NY2d 266; 282 NYS2d 519; 229 NE2d 206 (1967).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b475-5\"><em> </em>The dissent attempts to broaden this rationale for the incidental asportation rule.

I prefer the analytical framework that Justice Levin advocates\u2014a framework that I interpret as a distinctive harmless-error standard to be applied in cases in which the trial court has failed to properly instruct the jury on an essential element of a crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-8\">While I endorse the harmless-error standard that Justice Levin champions, I disagree with the conclusion that Justice Levin makes when he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>applies that standard to the error in the instant case, i.e., Justice Levin\u2019s finding that the deficient instruction was not a harmless error. If an appellate court focuses on what this jury actually found, as Justice Scalia directs it to do in <em>Sullivan v Louisiana, </em>508 US \u2014; 113 S Ct 2078; 124 L Ed 2d 182 (1993), I believe that the appellate court could properly conclude that, on the basis of the special circumstances of this case, the jury necessarily found the uninstructed element of asportation in furtherance of the kidnapping and not merely incidental to the criminal sexual conduct. See also <em>Pope v </em>Illinois, 481 US 497, 504; 107 S Ct 1918; 95 L Ed 2d 439 (1987) (Scalia, J., concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b483-4\">The trial judge instructed the jury that it had to find that the defendant \" 'must have forcibly moved or caused the victim to be moved from one place to another for the purpose of abduction and kidnapping.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ante </em>at 230-231. The undisputed asportation evidence that was actually argued to the jury pertained to movement that was clearly incidental exclusively to the kidnapping. In light of the guilty verdict, the jury had to have found that asportation transpired. Applying Justice Scalia\u2019s harmless-error framework, as it was explicitly explained by the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in <em>Martinez v </em>Borg, 937 F2d 422, 425 (CA 9, 1991), I find that \"no rational jury could have made those findings [the ones that we know the jury made on the basis of the instructions that were actually given] without also finding [the element of independent asportation].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b483-5\">To arrive at this conclusion does not require speculation on the part of the appellate court. Certainly, it is possible that the jury\u2019s asportation finding was based on the movement from the car to the motel room, or from the floor to the bed, as Justice Levin hypothesizes in his dissent at 274. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>However, in view of the particular nature of the asportation evidence that in fact was argued to the jury, I consider such a scenario to be highly unlikely and assert that the jury necessarily found asportation unique to the commission of the kidnapping. Accordingly, an appellate court could accurately rule that \"[t]he [instructional] error is harmless because it is 'beyond a reasonable doubt,\u2019 <em>Chapman v California, </em>386 US 18, 24 [87 S Ct 824; 17 L Ed 2d 705] (1967), that the jury found the facts necessary to support the conviction.\u201d <em>Carella v California, </em>491 US 263, 271; 109 S Ct 2419; 105 L Ed 2d 218 (1989) (Scalia, J., concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">As a final point, and one that I acknowledge neither the majority nor the dissent directly addresses, I write to object to the fact that the defendant in this case has been convicted of <em>both </em>first-degree criminal sexual conduct by penetration under circumstances involving the commission of another felony, and kidnapping\u2014where kidnapping serves as the other felony. As I have indicated on prior occasions, I regard the imposition of separate punishments under these circumstances to be a violation of the constitutional prohibition against double jeopardy, specifically the prohibition against multiple punishments for the same offense. See <em>People v Sturgis, </em>427 Mich 392, 413; 397 NW2d 783 (1986) (Cavanagh, J., dissenting); <em>People v Robideau, </em>419 Mich 458, 504-513; 355 NW2d 592 (1984) (Cavanagh, J., dissenting). I find it necessary to expressly reiterate my view that a legislature\u2019s authorization of successive punishments for the same offense does not dispose of the question whether a double jeopardy violation has occurred \" '[s]ince the Double Jeopardy Clause limits the power of all branches of government, <em>including the legislature </em>....\u2019\u201d <em>Robideau </em>at 510, quoting <em>Missouri v Hunter, </em>459 US 359; 103 S Ct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>673; 74 L Ed 2d 535 (1983) (Marshall, J., dissenting) (emphasis added). Moreover, as I also pointed out in <em>Robideau, </em>I find that \"the [Michigan] Legislature has not clearly and unequivocally authorized punishment for both first-degree criminal sexual conduct based on sexual penetration under circumstances involving any 'other felony\u2019 and the 'other felony.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 511.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-4\">In conclusion, I concur in the result reached in Justice Brickley\u2019s opinion, and the analyses set forth in parts n and hi of that opinion; and I join the analyses set forth in parts i, ii, and hi of Justice Levin\u2019s dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-4\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b485-5\">Levin, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ac1\">(dissenting). I agree with the signers of the lead opinion and the Chief Justice that the trial court erred in failing to instruct the jury that to consider the defendant, Derrick Terrance Vaughn, guilty of forcible-confinement kidnapping, it had to find beyond a reasonable doubt that Vaughn moved the victim and that that movement was not merely incidental to the commission of the underlying esc charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-6\">The failure to instruct on an essential element cannot be deemed harmless on the basis that a properly instructed jury surely would have found the uninstructed element.

The United States Supreme Court held that this instructional error was subject to harmless-error review. The Court emphasized that the presumption did not prevent the jury from considering every element of the crime because \"the jury . . . was clearly instructed that it had to find respondent guilty beyond a reasonable doubt as to <em>every element </em>of both first- and second-degree murder,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 579. The Court added that the erroneous instruction was not the equivalent of a directed verdict for the state because \"[w]hen a jury is instructed to presume malice from predicate facts, it still must find the existence of those facts beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 580.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-8\">In <em>Pope, </em>the trial court instructed the jury that the literary, artistic, political, or scientific value of allegedly obscene material should be determined by reference to how that material would be viewed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>by ordinary adults in the entire State of Illinois. The United States Supreme Court held that the value of a work should be determined under a \"reasonable person\u201d standard that is not specific to any city or state, and therefore found the instruction to be erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-6\">The Court rejected the defendants\u2019 claims that they were automatically entitled to a new trial because the jury had not found them guilty of an essential element of the crime of selling obscene materials, namely, that the materials lacked serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value. The Court compared this case to <em>Rose, </em>and said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-7\">[I]n the present cases the jurors were not precluded from considering the question of value: they were informed that to convict they must find, among other things, that the magazines petitioners sold were utterly without redeeming social value. While it was error to instruct the juries to use a state community standard in considering the value question, if a reviewing court concludes that no rational juror, if properly instructed, could find value in the magazines, the convictions should stand. <em>[Id. </em>at 503.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b488-8\"><em>Carella </em>concerned a California jury instruction that told jurors that a person who has leased or rented a vehicle and wilfully failed to return it within five days after it is due to be returned shall be presumed to have embezzled the vehicle. The Court first held that the instruction was unconstitutional because it \"subverted] the presumption of innocence accorded to accused persons and also invade[d] the truth-finding task assigned solely to juries in criminal cases.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 265. The Court held that the instructional error was subject to harmless-error analysis even though it \"foreclosed independent jury consideration of whether the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>facts proved established certain elements of the offenses with which Carella was charged.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 266. The Court remanded for a determination of \"whether no rational jury could find the predicate acts but fail to find the fact presumed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 267.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">Justice Scalia filed a concurring opinion in which he suggested how harmless-error review should be conducted when the trial court has given an instruction with an impermissible mandatory presumption. He first highlighted the problem with harmless-error review in the mandatory presumption context: the jury has arguably failed to make any finding on the fact that it was instructed to presume. He next explained that where a jury has failed to make a factual finding, a reviewing court may not find that element itself, no matter how overwhelming the evidence of that element may be. Justice Scalia, therefore, suggested that an appellate court could only review for harmless error in the mandatory presumption context by scrutinizing the jury instructions that were actually given in an attempt to determine whether the <em>jury </em>itself found the essential element. He said that an appellate court could find a mandatory presumption instruction harmless when \"the predicate facts relied upon in the instruction, or other facts necessarily found by the jury, are so closely related to the ultimate fact to be presumed that no rational jury could find those facts without also finding that ultimate fact, making those findings is functionally equivalent to finding the element to be presumed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 271.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-6\">After <em>Rose, Pope, </em>and <em>Carella,</em><footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the appellate courts were in disagreement whether a trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>court\u2019s failure to instruct on an essential element of an offense could ever be harmless error. Those courts that held that a failure to instruct could be harmless error could not agree when such an error would be deemed harmless.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">hi</p>\n<p id=\"b490-6\">The United States Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in <em>Sullivan v Louisiana, </em>508 US \u2014; 113 S Ct 2078; 124 L Ed 2d 182 (1993), precludes an appellate court from holding that a failure to instruct on an essential element is harmless because a properly instructed jury surely would have found the uninstructed element.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-7\">In <em>Sullivan, </em>the trial judge gave a faulty reasonable-doubt instruction. The prosecutor conceded that the instruction was improper, but he argued that the error was harmless beyond a reasonable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>doubt. The Court held that harmless-error analysis was not appropriate in this context, and, writing for a unanimous Court, Justice Scalia made the following observations concerning harmless-error analysis:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-4\"><em>Chapman </em>itself suggests the answer [whether this sort of error is subject to harmless-error analysis]. Consistent with the jury-trial guarantee, the question it instructs the reviewing court to consider is not what effect the constitutional error might generally be expected to have upon a reasonable jury, but rather what effect it had upon the guilty verdict in the case at hand. . . . Harmless-error review looks, we have said, to the basis on which \"the jury <em>actually rested </em>its verdict.\u201d . . . The inquiry, in other words, is not whether, in a trial that occurred without the error, a guilty verdict would surely have been rendered, but whether the guilty verdict actually rendered in <em>this </em>trial was surely unattributable to the error. That must be so, because to hypothesize a guilty verdict that was never in fact rendered\u2014 no matter how inescapable the findings to support that verdict might be\u2014would violate the jury-trial guarantee. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-5\">Once the proper role of an appellate court engaged in the <em>Chapman </em>inquiry is understood, the illogic of harmless-error review in the present case becomes evident. Since, for the reasons described above, there has been no jury verdict within the meaning of the Sixth Amendment, the entire premise of <em>Chapman </em>review is simply absent. There being no jury verdict of guilty-beyond-a-reasonable-doubt, the question whether the <em>same </em>verdict of guilty-beyond-a-reasonable-doubt would have been rendered absent the constitutional error is utterly meaningless. There is no <em>object, </em>so to speak, upon which the harmless-error scrutiny can operate. The most an appellate court can conclude is that a jury <em>would surely have found </em>petitioner guilty beyond a reasonable doubt\u2014not that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>jury\u2019s actual finding of guilty beyond a reasonable doubt <em>would surely not have been different </em>absent the constitutional error. That is not enough. . . . The Sixth Amendment requires more than appellate speculation about a hypothetical jury\u2019s action, or else directed verdicts for the State would be sustainable on appeal; it requires an actual jury finding of guilty. . . . [Emphasis in the original.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ayd\">Insofar as the possibility of harmless-error review is concerned, the jury-instruction error in this case is quite different from the jury-instruction error of erecting a presumption regarding an element of the offense. A mandatory presumption \u2014for example, the presumption that a person intends the ordinary consequences of his voluntary acts\u2014violates the Fourteenth Amendment, because it may relieve the State of its burden of proving all elements of the offense. . . . But \"[w]hen a jury is instructed to presume malice from predicate facts, <em>it still must find the existence of those facts beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d [Id., </em>113 S Ct 2081-2082. Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">The Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Sullivan </em>relied in part on Justice Stevens\u2019 dissenting opinion in <em>Pope v Illinois. </em>The portion of Justice Stevens\u2019 opinion on which the Court relied states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-6\">An application of the harmless-error doctrine ' under these circumstances [where a defendant is denied a jury determination on an essential element] would not only violate petitioners\u2019 constitutional right to trial by jury, but would also pervert the notion of harmless error. When a court is asked to hold that an error that occurred did not interfere with the jury\u2019s ability to legitimately reach the verdict it reached, harmless-error analysis may often be appropriate. <em>But this principle cannot apply unless the jury found all of the elements required to support a conviction. The harmless-error doctrine may enable a court to remove a taint from proceedings in order to pre</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number><em>serve a jury\u2019s \u00f1ndings, but it cannot constitutionally supplement those \u00f1ndings. It is fundamental that an appellate court (and for that matter, a trial court) is not free to decide in a criminal case that, if asked, a jury would have found something that it did not \u00f1nd. </em>We have consistently rejected the possibility of harmless error in these circumstances. [481 US 497-498. Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b493-4\">The analysis in <em>Sullivan </em>and the Court\u2019s reliance therein on Justice Stevens\u2019 opinion in <em>Pope, </em>indicates that harmless-error review necessarily assumes that the j\u00fcry has found all the elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt. Only after a jury has made such findings, as Justice Scalia explained, can a court intelligently ask whether the guilty verdict would have been the same absent the error. Where the jury has not found all the essential elements, an appellate court, in finding harmless error because a properly instructed jury surely would have found the uninstructed element, would be making the very mistake that Justice Scalia identified: it would be saying that the jury would surely have found all the essential elements.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">Judge Procter Hug, Jr., of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit recently explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-6\">This principle [that a court is not free to \"hypothesize a guilty verdict that was never in fact rendered,\u201d <em>Sullivan v Louisiana, </em>508 US \u2014, \u2014; 113 S Ct 2078, 2082; 124 L Ed 2d 182 (1993)] is equally applicable to a finding of an essential element of a crime\u2014in this case, knowledge. In order to render a verdict of guilty, a jury must find all of the essential elements of the crime, under proper instructions. \"[A] jury\u2019s verdict [of guilty] cannot stand if the instructions ... do not require it to find each element of the crime under a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>proper standard of proof.\u201d Here, the jury did not make a finding of knowledge under a proper instruction. For appellate court judges to make this finding, by concluding what the jury would have found under a proper instruction, violates the defendant\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to have a jury actually make that finding. It is a structural error of constitutional dimension\u2014the judges, instead of the jury, are making the finding essential to the verdict. <em>See Sullivan, </em>[508] US \u2014, \u2014; 113 S Ct 2082-2083. <em>[United States v Aguilar, </em>994 F2d 609, 636 (CA 9, 1993) (Hug, J., dissenting), opinion withdrawn and superseded by 21 F3d 1475 (CA 9, 1994). Citations omitted.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">The Ninth Circuit recently accepted Judge Hug\u2019s view in an en banc opinion written by Judge Hug. <em>United States v Gaudin, </em>28 F3d 943 (CA 9, 1994). The court said that \"a judge may not direct a verdict against a defendant no matter how clear the evidence, <em>nor may an appellate court conclude under a harmless error doctrine that a jury 'would have\u2019 found an essential element of the crime if the jury did not do so under proper instructions.

(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b494-6\">A number of state courts have also concluded, on the authority of <em>Sullivan, </em>that they may not review the record to determine whether a jury would have found an essential element had it been properly instructed. In <em>State v Pyke, </em>640 So 2d 460 (La App, 1994), the trial court instructed the jury that it could convict the defendant of attempted second-degree murder if it found that he had either a specific intent to kill or a specific intent to commit great bodily harm. In Louisiana, however, \"a specific intent to do great bodily harm is not an element of the crime of attempted second degree murder.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 462. Thus, in <em>Pyke, </em>there was no way of determining whether the jury had found all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>the essential elements of the charge when it rendered a guilty verdict. It may have found an intent to do great bodily harm instead of an intent to kill.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">After discussing <em>Sullivan\u2019s </em>teachings concerning harmless-error review, the court noted that it did not have the authority to deem an error harmless on the ground that a properly instructed jury surely would have found the uninstructed element:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-6\">The \"specific intent to inflict bodily harm\u201d error in this case must be likened to the \"beyond-a-reasonable doubt\u201d error which the United States Supreme Court in <em>Sullivan </em>determined is \"structural\u201d and vitiates all the jury\u2019s findings.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-7\">[Moreover,] determining what a reasonable jury might have done in instructional error cases <em>involving the de\u00f1nition of the crime </em>necessarily interjects speculation in the reviewing process and results in \"the wrong entity judging] the [defen-, dant\u2019s guilt].\u201d <em>Sullivan v Louisiana, supra.

The Wyoming Supreme Court reversed the defendant\u2019s conviction, even though the defendant had proffered the erroneous instruction, because <em>\"inaccurate jury instructions on a speci\u00f1cally repealed statute, resulting in a possible conviction without proof beyond a reasonable doubt of all present elements of a crime, cannot be excused </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number><em>as invited error or harmless error.

In <em>Martinez v Borg, 937 </em>F2d 422 (CA 9, 1991),<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit analyzed and adopted Justice Scalia\u2019s approach to harmless-error review, and concluded that Justice Scalia would permit a limited form of harmless-error review where a trial court failed to instruct the jury on an essential element of an offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-8\">The Ninth Circuit held that while an appellate court may not make its <em>own </em>determination of what a jury would have found had it been instructed on all the elements of the offense, the court may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>review the record to determine whether \" 'the <em>jury </em>found the facts necessary to support the conviction.\u2019 \u201d 937 F2d 424, quoting Carella, <em>supra </em>(Scalia, J., concurring). The Ninth Circuit focused on the following language in Justice Scalia\u2019s concurring opinion in <em>Carella:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b497-5\">When the predicate facts relied upon in the instruction, or other facts necessarily found by the jury, are so closely related to the ultimate fact to be presumed that no rational jury could find those facts without also finding that ultimate fact, making those findings is functionally equivalent to finding the element required to be presumed. [491 US 271.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b497-6\">In the Ninth Circuit\u2019s words, if the appellate court determines that the jury found all the facts necessary to support the conviction, then \" 'the erroneous instruction is simply superfluous: the jury has found, in <em>Winship\u2019s </em>words, \"every fact necessary\u201d to establish every element of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt.\u2019 \u201d 937 F2d 424, quoting <em>Rose v </em>Clark, supra.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>Thus, a failure to instruct may be found to be harmless error, according to the Ninth Circuit\u2019s reading of Justice Scalia\u2019s views, if the reviewing court can determine that \"no rational jury would have made these findings [the ones that we know the jury made on the basis of the instructions that were actually given] without also finding\u201d that the prosecution proved the uninstructed element beyond a reasonable doubt. 937 F2d 425.

Neither of these findings would establish the essential element of an asportation with independent significance. In sum, the findings that the jury must have made (on the basis of the instructions that were given) do not compel the conclusion that the jury must also have found an asportation of independent significance.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The failure to instruct on the asportation element in this case cannot be considered harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-5\">VI</p>\n<p id=\"b500-6\">Even under the view that an appellate court can find that a failure to instruct was harmless if it concluded that a properly instructed jury could not have reached a different verdict,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> the failure to instruct was not harmless in this case. It is not clear that a properly instructed jury would have convicted Vaughn of kidnapping.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-7\">When the jury\u2019s findings are read in light of the instructions, it becomes clear that the jury found that Vaughn raped Holly Smith, that he confined <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>her, and that he moved her some distance. The jury obviously believed much of Smith\u2019s testimony. It is noteworthy, however, that the portion of Smith\u2019s testimony concerning the rape (and the confinement in conjunction with the rape) was corroborated, in large part, by forensic evidence and other testimony. Holly\u2019s pelvis, vagina, and external genitalia were swollen. The police found nonmobile sperm in a vaginal smear taken from Holly, and they found semen in the crotch of Holly\u2019s panties. Vaughn could not be eliminated as the source of the semen in the panties. Holly was observed with bruises on her face that were consistent with her claim that Vaughn hit her while they were in the motel room.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-4\">The evidence of an asportation is not as strong as the evidence of the sexual assault. The <em>sole </em>evidence that Vaughn moved Holly against her will was Holly\u2019s own testimony. Holly testified that Vaughn drove her around while he was intoxicated and that during various stops he hit her.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-5\">Holly\u2019s testimony, however, was not fully consistent with her initial statements to the police or with her testimony at the preliminary examination, and Vaughn\u2019s lawyer impeached her on a number of aspects of the alleged asportation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-6\">\u2014Holly testified that while she and Vaughn were in the parking lot of Awad\u2019s party store, she asked Vaughn to take her back to the bar and to take her home. Vaughn\u2019s lawyer demonstrated that, in her initial report to Sergeant Elford, Holly mentioned only that she asked to be taken home at that point in the evening.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-7\">\u2014Holly testified that when she attempted to jump out of Vaughn\u2019s car, Vaughn pulled her back into the car and hit her in the face. Vaughn\u2019s lawyer then impeached Holly with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>her preliminary examination testimony that after Vaughn pulled her back into the car (1) the car door hit her in the. head, and (2) Vaughn did not do anything besides pull her back into the car (i.e., did not hit her).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-6\">\u2014Holly testified that when she ran from Vaughn\u2019s car in the unfamiliar neighborhood, she knocked on only a single door in search of help. Vaughn\u2019s lawyer confronted Holly with her statement to Sergeant Elford that she had knocked on several doors.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-7\">\u2014Holly testified that when Vaughn forced her back into his car after she ran away in the unfamiliar neighborhood, Vaughn hit her twice with a closed fist. Vaughn\u2019s lawyer impeached Holly with her statement to Sergeant Elford that mentioned only that Vaughn grabbed her around the neck and in which Holly did not say anything about being hit with a closed fist.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b502-8\">Not only was Holly Smith\u2019s testimony not \"uncontested,\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> it was <em>successfully </em>contested on a number of details.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-9\">I do not mean to suggest that the evidence was not sufficient to support a kidnapping conviction. If a properly instructed jury chose to believe the testimony of Holly Smith, it surely could have returned a verdict of guilty of kidnapping.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-10\">The uncorroborated testimony of Holly Smith\u2014 the sole evidence concerning the asportation and the force involved\u2014is not overwhelming evidence that Vaughn moved her independently of the sexual assault. It is not clear that a jury could not have disbelieved the portion of Holly\u2019s testimony that led up to the rape. An <em>Adams</em><footnotemark><em>15</em></footnotemark><em> </em>asportation instruction was necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>Contrary to the view expressed in the concurring opinion, the failure to instruct concerning \"incidental movement\u201d instruction could have converted a lesser offense into a more serious offense.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The kidnapping charge lodged against Vaughn was the predicate felony underlying the esc i charge against him. Thus, Vaughn could only have been convicted of esc i if the jury properly found that he had committed the offense of kidnapping.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> If the jury erroneously found an asportation and convicted Vaughn of. kidnapping\u2014on the basis of the movement from the car to the motel\u2014then its verdict on the esc i charge would also have been tainted. And, if the jury found only that Vaughn moved Holly Smith from the car to the motel, he should have been convicted of esc hi, not esc i. The failure to give the <em>Adams </em>asportation instruction could have led to Vaughn\u2019s conviction on a more severe charge._</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b486-5\"> See <em>In re Winship, </em>397 US 358, 364; 90 S Ct 1068; 25 L Ed 2d 368 (1970) (the prosecution must prove \"every fact necessary to constitute the crime with which [the defendant] is charged\u201d beyond a reasonable doubt); <em>Carella v California, </em>491 US 263, 265; 109 S Ct 2419; 105 L Ed 2d 218 (1989) (jury instructions that relieve the state.of the burden of proving the essential elements of a crime \"violate a defendant\u2019s due process rights\u201d); <em>Martinez v Borg, </em>937 F2d 422, 423 (CA 9, 1991) (failure to instruct on an essential element \"is constitutional error because the jury did not have the opportunity to find each element of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt\u201d); <em>Rael v Sullivan, </em>918 F2d 874, 875 (CA 10, 1990) (\"We agree with those cases cited by appellant holding that a complete failure to instruct on an essential element of an offense violates the right to.due process\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b486-6\"> There are a number of decisions by this Court that indicate that a failure to instruct on an essential element can never be harmless error.

In <em>Willard, </em>the defendant was charged with robbery, and the prosecution argued, inter alia, that Willard was guilty as an aider and abettor.

The New Mexico Supreme Court affirmed a conviction of criminal sexual contact of a minor although the trial court had failed to instruct the jury that the unlawfulness of the touching (i.e., that it was not for a medical or other proper purpose) was an element of the offense. The court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b498-7\">Th\u00e9 circumstances of these cases are important also because, to the extent we affirm the convictions, we do <em>not </em>in effect direct a verdict for the state or <em>make an independent finding </em>on the element of unlawfulness.
