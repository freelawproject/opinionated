The language of the statutes at issue makes clear that the conclusive presumption of dependency automatically terminates at the end of the statutorily mandated 500-week period. Thereafter, the continuation of benefits to dependents under a certain age is a discretionary decision of the Worker\u2019s Compensation Appellate Commission. A discretionary decision to continue benefits requires a factual finding of continued dependency in order to conform with the statutory mandates of the wdca. Finally, the logic behind this mode of procedure is elementary: employers obligated to pay death benefits under the wdca should not be required to pay death benefits after the period of statutory presumption has expired or has otherwise been terminated by statute without a showing of continued need.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> A finding to the contrary is outside the scope of the wdca and constitutes the sanction of economic waste.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-6\">i</p>\n<p id=\"b322-7\">Dennis Wainman was killed while driving a truck in the course of his employment with Michi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>gan Bell Telephone Company in February, 1972. Worker\u2019s compensation death benefits were paid to his widow, Candace, and his two children. In June 1973, she was remarried to Charles Murphy. Michigan Bell thereafter ceased payment of benefits to her pursuant to MCL 418.335; MSA 17.237(335), but voluntarily continued to pay benefits for the two children until the expiration of the 500-week period required by MCL 418.321; MSA 17.237(321).</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">Thereafter, Candace Murphy petitioned for a hearing of her claim that the children aged thirteen and nine, were entitled to benefits beyond the 500-week period, on the basis of \u00a7\u00a7 321 and 335 of the worker\u2019s compensation act, as dependent children. Michigan Bell argued that, although the children were under sixteen years of age at the end of the 500-week period, they no longer were dependent on their deceased father because they had been adopted by Charles Murphy and there was no factual showing of continued dependency on their deceased father.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-6\">A hearing referee ordered the continuation of benefits until the children were sixteen, and the Worker\u2019s Compensation Appeal Board affirmed. The Court of Appeals remanded for clarification. On remand, the wcab ruled that Michigan Bell was obligated under \u00a7\u00a7 331, 335, and 353 to pay benefits until the children were eighteen. After remand, the Court of Appeals reversed in an opinion per curiam, holding that the basis for the permissive ordering of continued weekly benefits is the recipient\u2019s continued dependency, concluding, on the basis of <em>Theodore v Packing Materials, Inc, </em>396 Mich 152; 240 NW 2d 255 (1976), that a child who is adopted ceases to be factually dependent on the deceased father. It stated further that in this case the adoption destroyed the rationale for the conclusive presumption of the children\u2019s depen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>dency and created a legal relationship in which the adoptive father assumed the legal obligation to provide for the children, thereby supplanting the legal relationship that gave rise to the statutory presumption.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">We granted leave to appeal. 444 Mich 866 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b324-6\">ii</p>\n<p id=\"b324-7\">The starting point of this Court\u2019s inquiry is to consider how to interpret the statutes involved. The cardinal rule of statutory construction is to discern and give effect to the intent of the Legislature. <em>Farrington v Total Petroleum, Inc, </em>442 Mich 201, 212; 501 NW2d 76 (1993). Where a statute is clear and unambiguous, interpretation is unnecessary. <em>Franks v White Pine Copper Div, </em>422 Mich 636, 650; 375 NW2d 715 (1985); <em>Dussia v Monroe Co Employees Retirement System, </em>386 Mich 244, 249; 191 NW2d 307 (1971). When different statutes address the same subject, courts must endeavor to read them harmoniously and give them reasonable effect. <em>House Speaker v State Administration Bd, </em>441 Mich 547, 568; 495 NW2d 539 (1993); <em>Huron Twp v City Disposal Systems, Inc, </em>201 Mich App 210, 212; 505 NW2d 897 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b324-8\">hi</p>\n<p id=\"b324-9\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b324-10\">The specific question we are asked to answer is whether the conclusive presumption of dependency terminates at the end of the 500-week period. Accordingly, it is appropriate to focus our inquiry on certain provisions of the wdca. We are aided by a particular statutory provision in our search to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>determine the existence and extent of dependency for death benefits recipients. MCL 418.341; MSA 17.237(341) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b325-5\">Questions as to who constitutes dependents and the extent of their dependency shall be determined as of the date of the injury to the employee, and their right to any death benefit shall become fixed as of such time, irrespective of any subsequent change in conditions <em>except as otherwise speci\u00f1cally provided in sections 321, 331 and 335. </em>[Emphasis added.][<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b325-6\">This language, which clearly indicates the legislative intent to maintain the conclusive presumption <em>except </em>as stated otherwise, requires no interpretation regarding the point that the conclusive presumption is erased under prescribed circumstances. See <em>Farrington, Franks, </em>and <em>Dussia, supra. </em>Creative construction that disregards the removal of the conclusive presumption under appropriate circumstances would therefore violate the legislative intent. With this in mind, we now turn to consideration of the statutes wherein one may find the circumstances removing the conclusive presumption._</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>B</p>\n<p id=\"b326-6\">First, MCL 418.321; MSA 17.237(321) provided, in relevant part, for death benefits as follows at the time of the decedent\u2019s injury and death:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b326-7\">[F]or a period of 500 weeks from the date of death. If at the expiration of the 500-week period any such wholly or partially dependent person is less than 21 years of age, a hearing referee . . . <em>may </em>order the employer to continue to pay the weekly compensation or some portion thereof until such . . . person reaches the age of 21. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b326-8\">The emphasized language indicates the discretionary nature of a hearing referee\u2019s ruling on the payment of continued benefits following the expiration of the 500-week period. In fact, use of the term \"may\u201d instead of the term \"shall\u201d indicates discretionary, rather than mandatory, action.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> It would be anomalous to hold that the hearing referee <em>must </em>order the continuance of death benefits after the 500-week period as a matter of law. To do so would nullify the quoted language of \u00a7 341 in violation of established precedent,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> would violate the clear legislative intent in \u00a7 321 of preserving discretion in hearing referees, see <em>Farrington, Franks, </em>and <em>Dussia, supra, </em>and would lead to forcing an employer to pay continued death benefits even in cases where the presumption has terminated <em>and </em>the legal and economic status of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>the claimant would make any further payments an absurdity.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">Second, the wdca also specifically provides for the termination of benefits payable to a dependent wife upon remarriage and a reassessment of benefits payable to dependent children. At the time of Dennis Wainman\u2019s death, MCL 418.335; MSA 17.237(335) provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-6\">Upon the remarriage of a dependant wife receiving compensation, such payments shall cease upon the payment to her of the balance of the compensation to which she would otherwise have been entitled but in no event to exceed the sum of $500.00 .... Where, at the expiration of the 500-week period, any such wholly or partially dependent person is less than 21 years of age, a hearing referee <em>may </em>order the employer to continue to pay the weekly compensation, or some portion thereof, until such wholly or partially dependent person reaches the age of 21. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b327-7\">In short, hearing referees are ordered to reassess the dependency of <em>children </em>at the end of the 500-week period in case of remarriage as well as to terminate an award to formerly dependent wives.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> There is no indication of any intent on the part of the Legislature to continue the conclusive presumption of total dependency after the statutory period in the case of children whose living parent remarries. Worthy of note is the emphasized lan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>guage that again calls for a hearing referee to exercise discretion regarding whether the facts support a continued award.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Thus, hearing referees may order continued benefits for the children of deceased employees as an exercise of the discretion granted in \u00a7 335 as well as in \u00a7 321. To remove this discretion by judicial fiat certainly violates the clear intent of the Legislature for a factual inquiry into the nature of any continued dependency on the part of a child in cases of <em>remarriage </em>even without consideration of the added concerns surrounding legal adoption. See <em>Farrington, Franks, </em>and <em>Dussia, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b328-6\">Third, MCL 418.331(l)(b); MSA 17.237(331)(l)(b) does not require the continued presumption of dependency in cases of remarriage of the surviving spouse or the end of the 500-week benefits period. Rather, the provision calls for the conclusive presumption of complete dependency for \"[a] child under the age of 16 years, or over if physically or mentally incapacitated from earning . . . .\u201d It is clear from the language of \u00a7 331 that individuals having prescribed relationships with a deceased employee and who are under the age of sixteen are to be treated as <em>wholly </em>dependent. What is not particularly clear is whether the Legislature intended for the age of sixteen years, as found in \u00a7 331(l)(b), to represent a termination date for the conclusive presumption. Keeping in mind that we are required to provide an harmonious reading and a reasonable effect to ambiguous language, see <em>House Speaker, supra, </em>we conclude that \u00a7 331(l)(b) defines only the status of dependency and not its length. In other words, \u00a7331(l)(b) controls the question <em>who </em>is entitled to the conclusive presumption of complete dependency and not <em>how long </em>the conclusive presumption remains.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>In addition, both \u00a7\u00a7 321 and 335 target 500 weeks from the date of death as a critical period in cases of death benefits. Any attempt to disregard this commonality would negate a concept that the Legislature considered important enough to mention twice.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">Indeed, it is the conclusive presumption provided in \u00a7 331(l)(b) that best supports the dissent. However, and as noted above, it is inappropriate to extend this presumption to the statute involving remarriage. We conclude that the presumption in \u00a7 331 does not nullify the termination of benefits following the conclusion of the statutory 500-week period provided in \u00a7 321 because it would violate the clear legislative intent previously described. Moreover, we are constrained to give an harmonious reading and reasonable effect to different statutes that arguably address the same subject, see <em>House Speaker </em>and <em>Huron Twp, supra, </em>without creating absurd results.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The legislative intent for termination of the conclusive presumption on the happening of certain events, together with the discretion afforded hearing referees to order continued benefits after these events occur, requires the conclusion that \u00a7 331(l)(b) relates to the qualification of an individual as a dependent and not how long the conclusive presumption of dependency lasts.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b329-6\">In sum, it is beyond doubt that the Legislature <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>intended the termination of the conclusive presumption of dependency under certain circumstances. These circumstances are the end of the statutory 500-week period and remarriage. See MCL 418.321, 418.335; MSA 17.237(321), 17.237(335).</p>\n<p id=\"b330-7\">iv</p>\n<p id=\"b330-8\">While it is clear that the conclusive presumption contained in \u00a7 331(l)(b) is not absolute, it is more problematic to discern which of the circumstances contained in \u00a7 341, i.e., remarriage (\u00a7 335) or the conclusion of the 500-week period (\u00a7 321), is operative under these facts. Moreover, the inquiry is further complicated by the legal adoption of the dependents involved. However, it is unnecessary to resolve this question at this time because defendant continued to pay death benefits to the two children after their adoption and their mother\u2019s remarriage and up to the end of the 500-week period.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Accordingly, we conclude that the presumption of dependency was terminated at the end of the 500-week period under the terms of \u00a7 321 and that it was incumbent upon the claimants to establish a continued factual dependency in order to justify further benefits.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> This holding ensures the continuation of benefits in appropriate cases, while providing hearing referees with the opportunity to exercise the discretion that is so clearly part of the statutory scheme. It also avoids <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>the absurd result of forcing employers to pay continued benefits where there is no further need.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">In conclusion, it is not argued that qualified dependents are entitled to enjoy the conclusive presumption of dependency. Disagreement arises regarding whether this presumption may be terminated before a dependent\u2019s reaching a certain age on th\u00e9 happening of specifically delineated events. It must be emphasized that there is no prohibition against a continuation of benefits following the occurrence of one or more of these events as long as hearing referees, within their statutorily authorized discretion, conclude that continued benefits are required. However, the burden of establishing a <em>continued </em>need of benefits rests with the same party who must establish the initial entitlement, i.e., the claimant.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-6\">Accordingly, we would affirm the decision of the Court of Appeals and remand the case to the wcac for further proceedings regarding whether claimants are entitled to a continuation of death benefits.</p>\n<judges id=\"b331-7\">Boyle, J., concurred with Riley, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b322-8\"> Cf. <em>Webster v Rotary Electric Steel Co, </em>321 Mich 526, 532; 33 NW2d 69 (1948) (the failure of the worker\u2019s compensation commission to lower an award after a spouse\u2019s remarriage constituted \"the imposition of a penalty upon employers\u201d and required reversal of an award).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b325-7\"> The language of this statute has remained unchanged since before Dennis Wainman\u2019s death to the present day, despite sweeping changes made in the wdca in the last decade.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-8\">Furthermore, this Court\u2019s inquiry into the issue involved in this case properly begins with consideration of \u00a7 341. Its title and its import evidence the fact that its specific purpose is to govern the existence and extent of any presumptions of dependency, while the other statutes define situations best described as categories of entitlement. See 2B Singer, Sutherland Statutory Construction (5th ed), \u00a7 51.05, p 174 (\"Where one statute deals with a subject in general terms, and another deals with a part of the same subject in a more detailed way, the two should be harmonized if possible; but if there is any conflict, the latter will prevail\u201d). Accordingly, we are required to treat the mandates of \u00a7 341 as paramount to sentences in other statutes that appear to be facially inconsistent when taken out of context.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b326-9\"> See <em>Lake Angelus v Oakland Co Rd Comm, </em>194 Mich App 220, 224; 486 NW2d 64 (1992) (\"The use of the term 'shall\u2019 in a statute indicates mandatory, rather than discretionary, action\u201d); <em>Mollett v City of Taylor, </em>197 Mich App 328, 339; 494 NW2d 832 (1992).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b326-12\"> See, e.g., <em>Feld v Robert &amp; Charles Beauty Salon, </em>435 Mich 352, 364; 459 NW2d 279 (1990) (\"every word of a statute should be given meaning and no word should be treated as surplusage or rendered nugatory if at all possible\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b327-8\"> See, e.g., <em>Reisman v Wayne State Univ Regents, </em>188 Mich App 526, 536; 470 NW2d 678 (1991) (\"Statutes are to be construed to avoid absurd or unreasonable consequences\u201d); <em>Webster, </em>n 1 <em>supra </em>at 531.

However, \u00a7 331 does not contain the type of termination language found in \u00a7\u00a7321 and 335. On the other hand, the negative implication of \u00a7 331(l)(b) is that children <em>over </em>the age of sixteen are not entitled to the conclusive presumption of total dependency. Thought of in this light, \u00a7 331 <em>does </em>contain an exception, which in turn leads to an harmonious reading of these statutes in concert.

However, resolution of this issue is not required under the facts of this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b330-10\"> In the absence of this presumption, one must resort to the underlying rule that it is a claimant\u2019s burden to establish factual dependency.

Rather, I believe the relevant statutory provisions can best be harmonized by construing dependency as a necessary, but not always sufficient, condition for the continuation of benefits. Under this interpretation, the conclusive presumption of depen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>dency merely enables a dependent under age sixteen to remain <em>eligible </em>for an extension of benefits; it does <em>not </em>automatically require the award of continuing benefits to these dependents. Accordingly, I write separately to express my disagreement with Justice Levin regarding this issue and to expound on my interpretation \u2022 of the relevant statutory provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-6\">i</p>\n<p id=\"b332-7\">THE CONCLUSIVE PRESUMPTION OF DEPENDENCY</p>\n<p id=\"b332-8\">Justice Levin concludes that the conclusive presumption of dependency<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> remains operative until age sixteen, requiring a magistrate to award continuing benefits to dependents until age sixteen, irrespective of whether the sixteenth birthday occurs before or after the initial 500-week benefit period has expired.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> While I concur in Justice <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>Levin\u2019s conclusion that the conclusive presumption of dependency remains viable until age sixteen, I cannot conclude that this presumption mandates an automatic award of benefits to those dependents under age sixteen upon the expiration of the initial 500 weeks. Instead, I would hold that, while the conclusive presumption of dependency dispels the need for a factual determination of dependency and renders the dependent eligible for further benefits, it does not guarantee that such benefits will be awarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">A careful examination of the relevant statutory provisions establishes that the Legislature envisioned dependency as being a prerequisite to, but not a guarantee of, continuing benefits. At the time of Dennis Wainman\u2019s death, \u00a7 321 provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-6\">If death results from the injury, the employer shall pay ... to the dependents of the employee, wholly dependent upon his earnings for support at the time of the injury, a weekly payment equal to 2/3 of his average weekly wages for a period of 500 weeks from the date of death . ... <em>If at the expiration of the 500-week period any such wholly or partially dependent person is less than 21 years of age, a hearing referee may order </em>the employer to continue to pay the weekly compensation or some portion thereof until such wholly or partially dependent person reaches the age of 21. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b333-7\">It is evident from this section that benefits are <em>not </em>automatically to be awarded at the end of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>500 weeks, even to a wholly dependent person. Rather, the magistrate has <em>discretion </em>to award continuing benefits. In this instance, the Legislature contemplated a situation in which persons may be wholly dependent, yet undeserving of benefits. Under \u00a7 321, any claimant seeking continuing benefits following the expiration of the initial 500 weeks must be either wholly or partially dependent and under age twenty-one. If both these criteria are met, the magistrate then has <em>discretion </em>to award continuing benefits; such benefits are <em>not </em>to be automatically awarded. In other words, while dependency is a necessary prerequisite to continuing benefits, it alone does not guarantee an award of benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-6\">Section 335 at the time of Dennis Wainman\u2019s death provided yet another illustration of a situation in which the Legislature contemplated that a wholly dependent person may be denied continuing benefits.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-7\">Upon the remarriage of a dependent wife receiving compensation, such payments [to the wife] shall cease . . . and further compensation, if any, shall be payable to the person either wholly or partially dependent upon deceased for support at his death as provided in subdivision (b) of section 331. . . . Where, at the expiration of the 500-week period, any such <em>wholly or partially dependent person </em>is less than 21 years of age, a hearing referee <em>may order </em>the employer to continue to pay the weekly compensation, or some portion thereof, until such wholly or partially dependent person reaches the age of 21. The payment of compensation to any dependent child shall cease when the child reaches the age of 21 years, if at the age of 21 years he is neither physically nor mentally incapacitated from earning, or when the child <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>reaches the age of 16 years and thereafter is self-supporting for 6 months. [Emphasis added.][<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">Under \u00a7 335, as under \u00a7 321, a claimant must be both dependent and less than twenty-one years of age<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> in order to be eligible for continuing benefits. After both requirements have been satisfied, a magistrate has <em>discretion </em>to award or deny continuing benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-6\">It is evident from these sections that the Legislature envisioned situations in which even wholly dependent persons could be denied continuing benefits. While dependency is often the determinative factor, it is clear from these provisions that the Legislature did not deem it to be <em>necessarily </em>dis-positive. Rather, it viewed dependency as a prerequisite that a claimant must satisfy in order to become eligible for continuing benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-7\">In fact, a careful examination of Justice Levin\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7\u00a7 321 and 335 confirms that it advocates a similar position concerning the weight to be accorded a dependency determination. In effect, Justice Levin also views dependency as necessary but not sufficient for continuing benefits. This conclusion is best illustrated by Justice Levin\u2019s discussion of the exceptions articulated in \u00a7 341.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Justice Levin asserts that under \u00a7 321 a magistrate deciding whether to order continuing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>benefits need only determine if the dependent is under twenty-one;<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> the magistrate need <em>not </em>determine dependency because the dependency determination was made at the time of the injury. Since it is clear that the magistrate has discretion to order benefits,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Justice Levin is essentially acknowledging that dependency is necessary for, but not determinative of, an award of benefits beyond the 500-week period under \u00a7 321.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-4\">Justice Levin\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 335 is also in accord with this view. It concludes that \u00a7 335 provides <em>only </em>for the determination whether a dependent is under eighteen at the end of 500 weeks.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> If a dependent is under age eighteen, a magistrate <em>may </em>order continuing benefits. In light of the fact that the dependency determination has already been made, Justice Levin\u2019s acknowledgment of the discretionary nature of continuing benefits supports the view that dependency is not necessarily sufficient to merit an award of continuing benefits.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b337-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>These examples are indicative of a potential inconsistency in Justice Levin\u2019s position. Justice Levin asserts that dependency is both necessary <em>and sufficient </em>for an award of continuing benefits to <em>persons under age sixteen, </em>but that dependency, though necessary, <em>is not necessarily sufficient </em>for an award of continuing benefits <em>to dependents over sixteen. </em>The question thus becomes whether there is textual support for this dichotomy of interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">Because the sole distinction under the relevant statutes between these two groups is the conclusive presumption of dependency applicable to those under age sixteen, I begin by examining the conclusive presumption of dependency. At the time of Dennis Wainman\u2019s death, \u00a7 331 stated, in pertinent part,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-6\">(1) The following persons shall be conclusively presumed to be wholly dependent for support upon a deceased employee:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-7\">(b) A child under the age of 16 years, or over 16 years of age if physically or mentally incapacitated from earning upon the parent with whom he or she is living at the time of the death of such parent. ... In all other cases questions of dependency, in whole or in part, shall be determined in accordance with the fact, as the fact may be at the time of the injury .... [MCL 418.331; MSA 17.237(331).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b338-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>It must be determined whether the effect of being \"conclusively presumed to be wholly dependent\u201d differs from the effects of a factual determination of dependency. Put another way, does the conclusive nature of the presumption of dependency transform the discretionary aspect of the magistrate\u2019s decision to award continuing benefits under \u00a7\u00a7 321 and 335 into a compulsory obligation to award such benefits? I believe it does not.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-6\">I would conclude that this statutory provision neither supports nor compels the conclusion that claimants conclusively presumed to be dependent are also automatically entitled to an award of continuing benefits. Rather, this provision simply states that children under the age of sixteen are conclusively presumed to be wholly dependent on the deceased employee with whom they are living at the time of death. The effect of this conclusive presumption is to preclude a defendant-employer from presenting evidence on the issue of dependency; it cannot attempt to establish that the dependent is in fact self-supporting. This conclusive presumption, however, does <em>not </em>prohibit the employer from presenting evidence regarding the diminished need for such benefits on the part of the dependent\u2019s parents or guardians. It is this distinction that allows the conclusive presumption of dependency and the discretionary nature of continuing benefits to be reconciled.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-7\">Accordingly, I would hold that there is a conclusive presumption of dependency until age sixteen, but that despite the existence of this presumption, benefits are not automatically continued until age sixteen; rather, continuing benefits may be awarded at the discretion of the magistrate.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b339-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>I would vacate the decision of the Court of Appeals and remand the case to the wcac for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b339-5\">Griffin, J., concurred with Brickley, J.</judges>\n<author id=\"b339-6\">Levin, J.</author>\n<p id=\"ATa\"><em>(separate </em>opinion).

In particular, \u00a7 335 stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-9\">The payment of compensation to any dependent child shall cease when the child reaches the age of 18 years, if at the age of 18 years he or she is neither physically nor mentally incapacitated from earning, or when the child reaches the age of 16 years and thereafter is self-supporting for 6 months. <em>If the child ceases to be self-supporting thereafter, the dependency shall be reinstated. </em>[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b336-10\">By stating that the \"dependency\u201d must be reinstated, it <em>could </em>be inferred from the statute that dependency is synonymous with compensation. This, however, does not comport with the interpretation advanced above in which dependency is a prerequisite to, but not a guarantee of, compensation. Two comments should serve to dispel any discomfort brought about by the language emphasized above.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-11\">First, the emphasized sentence could be read in a manner consis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>tent with the interpretation advanced above\u2014that the dependency is reinstated and, hence, the dependent once again becomes <em>eligible </em>for continuing benefits. Under this interpretation, a child who ceases to be self-supporting once again becomes eligible for benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-9\">Second, I have noted that the Legislature did not use \"dependency\u201d and \"benefits\u201d interchangeably in \u00a7 341, which suggests that the Legislature did not intend \"dependency\u201d to be the equivalent of \"benefits.\u201d Any inference to that effect appears contrary to the legislative intent.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b338-8\"> One may wonder what benefit the dependent derives from the conclusive presumption of dependency, given that it does not guarantee the continuation of benefits. In short, this presumption relieves <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>the dependent from having to make a showing of factual dependency, <em>and </em>it relieves that dependent\u2019s parents or guardians from having to show a financial need for such benefits, at least until such time as the defendant-employer has produced sufficient evidence to establish that the dependent\u2019s parents are no longer in need of continuing benefits. Does this interpretation in effect abolish the conclusive presumption of dependency? I think not, if one distinguishes between the child\u2019s ability to support himself and the parents\u2019 ability to support the dependent. The former involves the question of dependency; the latter entails a determination of the dependent\u2019s parents\u2019 financial need. It seems that the compensation scheme was designed to pay benefits to those persons who were both dependent <em>and </em>whose parents\u2019 financial condition evinced a need for such benefits. Under the interpretation advanced above, anytime an employer contests the continuation of benefits, a magistrate would engage in a two-pronged inquiry. First, is the child dependent? Second, do the child\u2019s parents need financial help? If both of these inquiries are answered in the affirmative, the magistrate should award continuing benefits consistent with his discretion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b339-8\"> Section 335 of the Worker\u2019s Disability Compensation Act (1969 PA 317), in effect at the time of Dennis Wainman\u2019s death, provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-9\">Upon the remarriage of a dependent wife receiving compensation, such payments shall cease upon the payment to her of the balance of the compensation to which she would otherwise have been entitled but in no event to exceed the sum of $500.00, and further compensation, if any, shall be payable to the person either wholly or partially dependent upon deceased for support at his death as provided in subdivision (b) of section 331.
