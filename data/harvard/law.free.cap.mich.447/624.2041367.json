Specifically, we must decide whether the insured\u2019s act of confronting and firing a shotgun at an occupied vehicle with the admitted intent only to scare and cause property damage, but with the actual consequence of personal injury to the driver, is covered by insurance where the policy covers acts caused by an occurrence, but excludes coverage for damage resulting from acts either expected or intended from the standpoint of the insured. We conclude that while coverage may exist under the occurrence provision and the test discussed herein, on the instant facts this question is for the trier of fact and cannot be resolved as a matter of law. Nonetheless, because we find that coverage is precluded under the intentional acts exclusion, Auto Club has no duty to defend or indemnify. We therefore would reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"AtFx\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b854-5\">In the instant case, plaintiff sought a determination that its insurance policy does not cover the possible liability resulting from the tort suit brought by Michael Marzonie against Vernon Oaks, an insured under his parents\u2019 homeowners\u2019 policy. The parties stipulated that the facts and testimony taken from an earlier automobile insurance trial would serve as the record in this case, with the trial judge acting as the trier of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-6\">Review of that record indicates that an altercation arose between the occupants of two vehicles driven by Marzonie and Oaks, respectively. Although there is conflicting testimony in the record, apparently somebody in either Marzonie\u2019s or Oaks\u2019 vehicle made an obscene gesture to the other while stopped at an intersection. In any event, Marzonie stepped out of his vehicle and urged the occupants of the Oaks vehicle to fight. This led to a lengthy, high-speed chase throughout the City of Flint. During the chase, Marzonie and friends threw beer bottles at the Oaks vehicle and, on one occasion, tossed a bottle through an open side window. The chase continued until Oaks drove home and ran, along with the other occupants of his vehicle, into the house. Still in pursuit, Marzonie arrived and stopped in front of the Oaks house, leaving his engine running.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-7\">While inside, Oaks apparently heard bottles being thrown at his house and driveway.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Nevertheless, instead of calling the police, Oaks retrieved a shotgun from his bedroom, a gun he had never <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>fired,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and proceeded outside to confront and scare off Marzonie and friends. Upon arriving outside, he saw Marzonie\u2019s vehicle in the street, evidencing no attempt to leave the premises. Indeed, instead of leaving, Oaks testified that Marzonie\u2019s vehicle \"crept\u201d or drove slowly in his direction,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> causing Oaks to respond by aiming and firing the gun at the grill of Marzonie\u2019s vehicle. Because this shot did not discharge, he fired a second shot, which actually hit Marzonie.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> However, not seeing any visible damage to the vehicle, Oaks believed he had missed, and, as Marzonie\u2019s vehicle began to back up, Oaks attempted to fire another shot, this time at the rear tire of the vehicle. When the gun again misfired, Oaks fired a final shot, striking one of the rear tires. Marzonie\u2019s vehicle then departed, with Jeffrey Dingo taking control of the vehicle and driving Marzonie to the hospital. As a result of these events, Oaks pleaded guilty of careless discharge of a firearm.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b855-4\">Despite his guilty plea, Oaks testified for purposes of the civil actions that he did not intend to hit Marzonie, noting that he easily could have shot Marzonie when he was in front of him, but instead shot at the grill. Oaks maintained that he simply wanted to stop the vehicle so the police could be called.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b855-5\">After oral argument and review of the record, the trial court held that coverage was not precluded because the intentional acts exclusion did not apply. Although properly raised in the com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>plaint, the court never addressed the first question of coverage, i.e., was there an occurrence? Instead, relying on the exclusionary language, the court found no actual intent to injure and no certainty of injury so that an expectation to injure could be inferred as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-6\">On appeal, the Court of Appeals affirmed in an unpublished per curiam opinion, issued May 21, 1993 (Docket No. 132237). In reviewing the record under a clearly erroneous standard of review, the Court found there to be an occurrence, noting that the shooting was \"an undesigned contingency which was not anticipated or naturally expected.\u201d Slip op at 2. Turning then to the intentional acts exclusion, the Court likewise found it not preclusive of coverage. Using a subjective standard, the Court held that Oaks did not intend to injure Marzonie, nor was the injury \"the expected or anticipated result of the intentional act of Oaks.\u201d Slip op at 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-7\">This Court granted plaintiff\u2019s application for leave to appeal on April 20, 1994.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b856-8\">ii</p>\n<p id=\"b856-9\">In interpreting an insurance policy, we attempt to effect the intent of the parties by first reviewing the policy language. <em>Auto-Owners Ins Co v Churchman, </em>440 Mich 560, 566; 489 NW2d 431 (1992). When the language is clear and unambiguous on its face and does not offend pubic policy, we simply apply the terms as written. <em>Id. </em>at 567; <em>Group Ins Co v Czopek, </em>440 Mich 590, 596; 489 NW2d 444 (1992); <em>Allstate Ins Co v Freeman </em>and <em>Metropolitan Property &amp; Liability Ins Co v DiCicco, </em>432 Mich 656, 667; 443 NW2d 734 (1989). Moreover, if an ambiguity exists, it is resolved in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>favor of the insured, i.e., coverage. <em>Powers v DAIIE, </em>427 Mich 602, 624; 398 NW2d 411 (1986). However, simply because a policy does not define a term does not render the policy ambiguous. <em>Fireman\u2019s Fund Ins Co v Ex-Cell-O Corp, </em>702 F Supp 1317, 1323, n 7 (ED Mich, 1988). Instead, absent a policy definition, terms are \"given a meaning in accordance with their common usage.\u201d <em>DiCicco, supra </em>at 666.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-4\">Similarly, when construing an exclusionary provision, the language must be \"strictly construed against the insurer.\u201d <em>Czopek, supra </em>at 597. However, if the language is clear and specific, it simply must be applied. Indeed, this Court will not countenance holding \"an insurance company liable for a risk it did not assume.\u201d <em>Churchman, supra </em>at 567; <em>Kaczmarck v La Perriere, </em>337 Mich 500; 60 NW2d 327 (1953).</p>\n<p id=\"b857-5\">In the instant case, we are presented with two questions: the first interpreting the scope of coverage, i.e., an occurrence or accident, and the latter construing exclusionary language, i.e., the intentional acts exclusion. This Court has determined that the proper mode of construction first addresses whether coverage exists and then turns to the exclusionary language if necessary. See <em>DiCicco, supra </em>at 667-668. Accordingly, we must first decide whether this shooting constitutes an occurrence.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-6\">in</p>\n<p id=\"b857-7\">In Auto Club\u2019s policy, occurrence is defined as an \"accident . . . which results ... in bodily injury or property damage.\u201d However, the policy does not define accident. Nevertheless, in <em>DiCicco, supra, </em>this Court, applying its common usage to identical policy language, held that \"an accident is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>an undesigned contingency, a casualty, a happening by chance, something out of the usual course of things, unusual, fortuitous, not anticipated, and not naturally to be expected.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 670. While this Court agreed on the statement of this test, a majority of this Court has yet to fully develop the workings and scope of this definition.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-5\">In <em>DiCicco, </em>we provided only part of the answer by observing that accidents are not limited to unintentional acts. <em>Id. </em>at 670. Yet, in applying the definition to the facts of the case, we held that the record was not \"clear cut enough\u201d to conclude that there was no occurrence, i.e., whether the insured had any intention of using a knife or whether the victim perceived it as such. <em>Id. </em>at 672. Indeed, in <em>DiCicco, </em>the insured disavowed any intent to use the knife, instead allegedly harboring the knife in order to scare away his victim. During a skirmish, however, the knife entered the victim\u2019s stomach. Thus, construing the term \"accident\u201d broadly, it was possible to find the actual use of the knife accidental. Nevertheless, we specifically noted that in appropriate situations \"we do not preclude the possibility that an incident may not be considered an 'occurrence\u2019 under the coverage section of the policy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 672, n 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-6\">On the other hand, we found the factual setting in <em>Czopek, supra, </em>to be one of these appropriate circumstances. In <em>Czopek, </em>the insured intentionally injured two police officers during an attempted arrest. The police officers sought compensation for their injuries, and the insurer sought a declaration that there was no coverage. This Court held that no coverage existed because the act of forcibly resisting arrest did not constitute an occurrence. Indeed, unlike <em>DiCicco, </em>this Court found the record clear enough to permit a finding of no occurrence. <em>Czopek, supra </em>at 598.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>However, neither in <em>DiCicco </em>nor in <em>Czopek </em>did a majority of this Court specifically address whether the accident should be viewed from the insured\u2019s or the injured person\u2019s perspective,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> or how the conduct and resulting injury affect a court\u2019s view of the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-5\">In <em>Frankenmuth Mutual Ins Co v Piccard, </em>440 Mich 539, 549-550; 489 NW2d 422 (1992), three members of the Court agreed that an accident, although defined differently than in the instant case,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> should be viewed from the injured person\u2019s perspective. Moreover, although the majority in <em>Czopek </em>did not address this issue, Justice Boyle\u2019s concurrence explained that under policy language identical to that in the instant case, where the insurer does not designate the perspective in the policy, the accident must be viewed from the injured party\u2019s perspective. <em>Id. </em>at 608-612. However, this Court has yet to achieve a majority on the issue presented by the parties in this case: the Auto Club arguing that the insured\u2019s perspective is controlling and Marzonie contending that the injured person\u2019s perspective is controlling._</p>\n<p id=\"b860-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>Turning first to case law from other jurisdictions, we note that there is a split of authority, at least with respect to assaults, regarding whose perspective is controlling.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Indeed, our survey of the cases reveals that both perspectives can be said to further important public policies, with the injured party\u2019s perspective promoting the policy of compensating persons for their losses and the insured\u2019s perspective deterring persons from engaging in intentional or criminal conduct. <em>Czopek, supra </em>at 608-609 (opinion of Boyle, J.). While we are sensitive to these competing policy considerations, our review of the instant policy language and relevant Michigan precedent leads us to conclude that the injured person\u2019s perspective is controlling.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-5\">From our review of the policy language, we cannot glean any intent with respect to perspective because it simply is hot addressed. Accordingly, where the policy is silent with respect to perspective, we would hold that the accidental nature of the event must be evaluated from the injured party\u2019s standpoint. <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> See <em>Ashland Oil, Inc v </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number><em>Miller Oil Purchasing Co, </em>678 F2d 1293 (CA 5, 1982); <em>Czopek, supra </em>at 609 (opinion of Boyle, J.).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> In other words, by not designating the perspective in the policy, we would construe this ambiguous language against the insurer and would hold that the injured party\u2019s perspective controls.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> See <em>DiCicco, supra </em>at 665.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-5\">Moreover, viewing the accident from the injured <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>person\u2019s standpoint is in accord with Michigan precedent that construed the term accident under an automobile insurance policy. See <em>State Farm Mutual Automobile Ins Co v Coon, </em>46 Mich App 503; 208 NW2d 532 (1973). In <em>Coon, </em>the plaintiff-insurer sought a declaration that it had no duty to indemnify the insured for his intentional act of hitting a person with his vehicle. However, the Court of Appeals held that the insurer had a duty to defend, finding that the accident should be determined from the injured person\u2019s perspective. <em>Id. </em>at 505-508.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-4\">In reaching this conclusion, the Court of Appeals relied on <em>New Amsterdam Casualty Co v Jones, </em>135 F2d 191 (CA 6, 1943). In <em>Jones, </em>the insured business owner shot a person during a dispute. That person sued the business owner and won a judgment. Thereafter, the injured person sought to collect on the judgment by garnishing the insurance company.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-5\">On appeal, the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit had to construe the meaning of accident in the policy. It first noted that Michigan and many other jurisdictions have held the intentional infliction of injury to be an accident <em>except </em>when the injured person is responsible for it, i.e., an aggressor or one who is otherwise blameworthy for the injuries. <em>Id. </em>at 193, citing <em>Furbush v Maryland Casualty Co, </em>131 Mich 234, 237-238; 91 NW 135 (1902) (\"The text-books have been slow to admit that [an intentional homicide] is accidental, but the majority of adjudicated cases hold that it is <em>where the deceased is in no wise responsible for it\u201d). </em>To justify this result, the court reasoned that the accident must \"be determined from the standpoint of the one suffering it, rather than from the standpoint of the one inflicting it . . . .\u201d We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-6\">Plaintiff, however, maintains that <em>Coon </em>and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>other Michigan precedent is distinguishable because the persons in those cases suffering the injuries were also the insureds. See, e.g., <em>Ripley v Railway Passengers Assurance Co, </em>20 F Cas 823 (WD Mich, 1870) (coverage exists for an insured under a life insurance policy because, although intentionally killed by another, when viewed from his perspective, it was an accident); <em>Peterson v Aetna Life Ins Co, </em>292 Mich 531; 290 NW 896 (1940) (coverage exists under a life insurance policy because death, when viewed from the injured person/insured\u2019s perspective, was accidental with regard to him). <footnotemark>14</footnotemark> We have reviewed these authorities and acknowledge the distinction, but we do not find the distinction dispositive. Rather, we find no persuasive reason to depart from well-established Michigan precedent that has broadly construed accidents, except when the persons seeking coverage or indemnity are somehow responsible for the events. Moreover, while Michigan courts have not directly extended this policy where the injured person and the insured are different parties, we find precedent from other jurisdictions that have done so persuasive.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> In any event, absent some indication in the policy,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> the injured person\u2019s perspective appears to be the majority <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>rule.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Therefore, we find the injured person\u2019s perspective controlling.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-4\">Furthermore, in reaching this conclusion, we acknowledge but reject the contention that the conduct by itself, without consideration of its possible result, should be determinative of the accidental nature of the event. Such a holding would be contrary to Michigan precedent. Indeed, \"we established in [DiCicco] that it is possible to have a cause of action where the intentional conduct will result in unintended and unexpected injury thus constituting an 'accident\u2019 under the policy language.\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> See <em>Piccard, supra </em>at 548-549 (opinion of Riley, J.), citing <em>DiCicco, supra </em>at 670. Therefore, we reiterate that, under the instant policy language, and evaluated from the injured person\u2019s perspective, an accident may include an unforeseen consequence of an intentional act of the insured.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b864-6\">Finding that the injured party\u2019s perspective controls, however, does not end our inquiry. As noted above, precedent in Michigan and throughout the United States generally will refuse to deem an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>event an accident where the injured party provokes the injury, i.e., is an aggressor or is otherwise blameworthy.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> In part on the basis of public policy, this precedent simply recognizes that the facts and circumstances as a whole must be considered in applying the definition of accident, i.e., under the facts of the case, was the injury foreseen from the injured party\u2019s perspective:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b865-4\">\"An insured who meets death in an affray in which he was the aggressor cannot ordinarily be said to have suffered his injuries as the result of an accident, for he must be held to have foreseen the result of his wrongful acts.\u201d <em>[Peterson, supra </em>at 535, quoting <em>Interstate Business Men\u2019s Accident Ass\u2019n v Lester, </em>257 F 225 (CA 8, 1919).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b865-5\">In the instant case,<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> there certainly is culpable conduct on both sides. Beginning with the initial encounter, the record indicates that somebody in one of the vehicles made an obscene gesture to the other, resulting in a high-speed chase by Marzonie throughout the City of Flint. At one point, while <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>stopped at the intersection, Marzonie stepped out of his vehicle, urging Oaks and friends to engage in a fight. Furthermore, occupants of the Marzonie automobile admitted throwing beer bottles at the Oaks automobile during the chase, with one bottle traveling through the side window of the vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-4\">Further culpable conduct is found once Marzonie arrived at the Oaks house. Oaks indicated that bottles were thrown at his house and driveway, whereas Jeffrey Dingo disputes this contention. Moreover, Oaks testified that when he came outside with the gun, Marzonie\u2019s vehicle crept or rolled towards him, whereas Dingo testified that this never happened. Nonetheless, Marzonie did not immediately retreat after Oaks reappeared from the house with the shotgun. Not until after the first and second shots were fired did Marzonie put the car in reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-5\">Therefore, we conclude that, given the disputed facts, we cannot, as a matter of law, decide that Marzonie was so blameworthy for the events that developed that the shooting was an undesigned contingency, casualty, happening by chance, out of the usual course of things, unusual, fortuitous, not anticipated, and not naturally to be expected. Certainly the dangerous nature of this high-speed chase, the invitation to fight, the admitted throwing of bottles at the Oaks vehicle, and the failure to immediately retreat once Oaks reappeared with the gun, all dictate against finding an accident. However, the resolution of this question is for the trier of fact. While remand would normally be necessary to resolve this question of fact, we turn first to the exclusionary language to determine whether coverage is nonetheless precluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-6\">v</p>\n<p id=\"b866-7\">Auto Club\u2019s policy excludes coverage for \"bodily <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>injury or property damage which is either expected or intended from the standpoint of the Insured.\u201d In <em>DiCicco, supra, </em>a majority of this Court found the language clear and unambiguous and held that the \"expected or intended\u201d language requires the application of a policy-blended subjective test.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> In reaching this conclusion, we noted that the words \"intended\u201d and \"expected\u201d were designed to expand the policy beyond mere intended injuries.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 673. Accordingly, the policy language now precludes coverage for both intended <em>and </em>expected injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-5\">As previously construed by this Court, coverage is barred for intended injuries if the insured intends some type of injury, albeit that the actual injury was of a different character or magnitude <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>than that intended. See <em>Churchman, supra </em>at 577 (opinion of Riley, J.); <em>Piccard, supra </em>at 549-550 (opinion of Riley, J.). However, coverage is also precluded for expected injuries where the insured was \"aware[ ] that harm was likely to follow from the performance of his intentional act.\u201d<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> <em>Piccard, supra </em>at 550 (opinion of Riley, J.). In other words, coverage is precluded if the insured\u2019s claim that he did not intend or expect the injury \" 'flies in the face of all reason, common sense and experience.\u2019 \u2019,<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> See <em>DiCicco, supra </em>at 720 (opinion of Boyle, J.); <em>id. </em>at 682 (opinion of Riley, C.J.).</p>\n<p id=\"b868-6\">In this case, we agree that Oaks intended to cause property damage, but did not subjectively <em>intend </em>some type of injury within the meaning of the exclusionary language. However, we are persuaded that Oaks did or should have <em>expected </em>injury to follow from his actions and accordingly find coverage precluded as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-7\">The record indicates that instead of calling the police, Oaks returned from his house with a shotgun, a weapon that he had never previously fired, and directly confronted the Marzonie vehicle. With this occupied vehicle directly in front of him, Oaks then fired at the grill of the car, with the unfortunate result of hitting Marzonie in the head. In light of his inexperience in firing this gun, especially when aiming at a target that left only a small margin for error,<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> we are persuaded that Oaks should have expected that there was a sub<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>stantial likelihood that he might miss the grill and hit an occupant of the Marzonie vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-4\">Moreover, we note that Oaks did have some experience with other guns and presumably had some knowledge' regarding the operation and mechanics of a gun, including its ammunition. In this case, Oaks admitted that he loaded the shotgun with both slugs and bird shot shells. However, he indicated that at the time of the shooting he did not know what order the shells were arranged. Given this fact, we are persuaded that Oaks\u2019 knowledge that the gun was also loaded with bird shot shells<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> satisfies the \"expected\u201d language in the policy because he should have expected that some of the shells were likely to spray in an larger radius than the intended target, i.e., the grill, and thus likely hit one of the occupants of the vehicle. The fact that Marzonie was actually injured by a slug rather than a bird shot shell does not change the fact that he should have known that shooting this shotgun, with both slug and bird shot shells, at the front of this occupied vehicle was likely to result in bodily injury rather than simply property damage.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-5\">In other words, on these facts, we conclude that the contention that Oaks did not intend or expect this injury \"flies in the face of all reason, common sense and experience.\u201d His inexperience and training with this gun, the small margin for error given the position of the vehicle, the use of both bird shot and slug shells, and the overall intention in aiming at this occupied vehicle persuade us that coverage is precluded as a matter of law.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark>_</p>\n<p id=\"AbE\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>VI</p>\n<p id=\"b870-5\">In sum, with respect to the first question, whether this shooting, which resulted in bodily injury, is covered by the insurance policy, we hold that coverage must be determined by construing the term \"accident\u201d from the injured person\u2019s perspective. Under this test and on the instant facts, however, this question is left for the trier of fact and therefore cannot be resolved as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-6\">Nevertheless, the exclusionary language of this policy precludes coverage as a matter of law and thus makes further consideration of the coverage question unnecessary.

While the policy language is the same, this Court did not decide the issue of perspective. Evidence of this fact is demonstrated by reviewing <em>Frankenmuth Mutual Ins Co v Piccard, </em>440 Mich 539; 489 NW2d 422 (1992), which was issued the same day. There, Justices Mallett and Brickley joined my lead opinion, which found the injured person\u2019s perspective controlling. Notably, Justice Mallett authored the majority opinion in <em>Czopek, </em>joined by Chief Justice Cavanagh and Justices Brickley, Riley, and Griffin. This inconsistency demonstrates the fallacy of Justice Griffin\u2019s contention.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b859-8\"> Frankenmuth Mutual defined \"occurrence\u201d as \"an accident, including continuous or repeated exposure to conditions, which results in bodily injury or property damage neither expected nor intended from the standpoint of the insured.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 547.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b860-6\"> See 72 ALR3d 1090.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b860-7\"> In <em>Guerdon Industries v Fidelity &amp; Casualty Co of New York, </em>371 Mich 12, 18; 123 NW2d 143 (1963), this Court considered the term accident in a liability policy.

Justice Griffin states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b861-9\">I submit that a principled distinction can be drawn by examining the consequences of the action and determining whether such consequences either were intended by the insured or reasonably should have been expected because of the direct risk of harm intentionally created by the insured\u2019s actions. [Post at 648-649.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b861-10\">The contention that liability policies are primarily intended to protect the insured is lost once this broad construction is given to the insurer. Indeed, in applying the policy, he gives the insurer the benefit of any ambiguity rather than the insured and construes the \"occurrence\u201d language so broadly in favor of the insurer that the provision specifically directed at excluding this type of conduct, i.e., the intentional acts exclusion, becomes virtually meaningless. The intentional acts exclusion precludes coverage for \"bodily injury or property damage which is either expected or intended from the standpoint of the Insured.\u201d It is well established in Michigan jurisprudence that this requires an application of a policy-blended <em>subjective </em>test. See part v. Justice Griffin, however, rewrites .the policy so that the intentional acts exclusion would never be needed because coverage would be barred under the occurrence language, using a test almost identical to the broader, <em>objective </em>exclusionary language interpreted in <em>Freeman, supra. </em>In interpreting the instant policy, such a view is untenable and unsupported by case law or the policy itself. Accordingly, I submit that instead of creating a \"principled distinction,\u201d Justice Griffin\u2019s test is clearly unprincipled, contrary to traditional interpretations of insurance policies, and obviously contrary to the stricture of the policy itself.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b863-5\"> See also <em>Reed v Mutual Benefit Health &amp; Accident Ass\u2019n, </em>345 Mich 586, 590-591; 76 NW2d 869 (1956); <em>Hooper v State Mutual Life Assurance Co, </em>318 Mich 384, 390-391; 28 NW2d 331 (1947).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b863-8\"> See, generally, 72 ALR3d 1090; Rynearson, n 12 <em>supra </em>at 521-522; see also <em>Ashland Oil, supra </em>at 1320.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b863-10\"> We again note that the insurer could have explicitly designated the perspective, but chose not to do so.

Our review of the record supports Marzonie\u2019s theory that this issue was not raised below. However, we note that consideration of the injured person\u2019s perspective was first squarely presented in Michigan jurisprudence in 1992, shortly before oral argument in the Court of Appeals. Plaintiff addressed these arguments by supplemental brief in the Court of Appeals, but essentially contended that the insured\u2019s perspective controls or should control, basing the argument on the lack of majority in this Court. Marzonie did not file a supplemental brief on this issue. Indeed, the Court of Appeals did not rule on the issue of perspective. Given our adoption of the insured party\u2019s perspective in the case at bar and the contested record, we do not decide this issue as a matter of law. Nonetheless, our conclusion regarding the exclusionary language makes further inquiry on remand unnecessary.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b867-6\"> See <em>DiCicco, supra </em>at 679 (opinion of Riley, C.J.)

I would hold as a matter of law that the insured\u2019s intentional discharge of a firearm at the grill of Marzonie\u2019s car was not an accident. Consequently, no \"occurrence,\u201d within the meaning of the liability policy has transpired, and it is unnecessary to consider the applicability of the exclusionary clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-5\">An analysis of insurance coverage must necessarily begin with the relevant contractual language.

Despite the connotations of the word \"accident,\u201d we have recognized that an insured need not act unintentionally in order for an act to be an \"occurrence.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Consequently, a problem arises in attempting to distinguish between intentional acts that can be classified as \"accidents\u201d and those that cannot. I submit that a principled distinction can be drawn by examining the consequences of the action and determining whether such consequences either were intended by the insured or reasonably should have been expected because of the direct risk of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>harm intentionally created by the insured\u2019s actions. When an insured acts intending to cause property damage or personal injury, liability coverage should be denied, irrespective of whether the resulting injury is different from the injury intended. Similarly, I would hold that when an insured\u2019s intentional actions create a direct risk of harm, there can be no liability coverage for <em>any </em>resulting damage or injury, despite the lack of an actual intent to damage or injure.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b875-4\">These rules comport with the contractual nature of a liability policy and recognize its inherent function to protect an <em>insured </em>from the unintended and unexpected consequences of his actions. Liability insurance does not exist to insulate an insured from the ramifications of his intentional actions designed or reasonably expected to cause property damage or personal injury. Additionally, these rules find support in our decision in <em>Czopek, </em>which was signed by five members of this Court. For these reasons, I would apply these rules to the case at bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-5\">Oaks testified that he did not intend to shoot Marzonie, but intended only to hit the grill of Marzonie\u2019s car in order to stop it and to call the police. Oaks\u2019 assertion that he did not intend to shoot Marzonie should not remove the bar to coverage arising from his admitted intent to cause property damage. That the nature of the resulting harm differed from the intended harm is irrelevant for purposes of coverage. I would hold that Oaks\u2019 actions cannot be characterized as an accident, and consequently, there has been no occurrence. Accordingly, there is no liability coverage for the resulting injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-6\">I would reverse the decision of the Court of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>Appeals and conclude there has not been an \"occurrence.\u201d</p>\n<judges id=\"b876-4\">Cavanagh, C.J., and Brickley, J., concurred with Griffin, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b871-9\"> In <em>Freeman, </em>\"accident\u201d was defined in this context as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b871-10\">\"an undesigned contingency, a casualty, a happening by chance, something out of the usual course of things, unusual, fortuitous, not anticipated, and not naturally to be expected.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b872-9\"> <em>Ante </em>at 684.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b872-10\"> See Jerry, Understanding Insurance Law, p 15.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b872-11\"><em> </em>See 11 Couch, Insurance, 2d (rev ed), \u00a7 44:1, p 185; 7A Appleman, Insurance Law &amp; Practice, \u00a7 4491, p 4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b872-12\"> Couch, n 4 <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 44:3, p 187.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b873-10\"> See Sosin &amp; Sherburn, <em>Insurance law, </em>40 Wayne LR 887, 922 (1994).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b874-7\"><em> </em>See <em>id. </em>at 602 (Boyle, J., concurring).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b874-8\">I write separately to state that because the insurance contract does not require an examination of the accidental nature of the event from the insured\u2019s perspective to determine whether an \"accident\u201d that resulted in the officers\u2019 bodily injuries was an occurrence, the accidental nature of the event must be viewed from the officers\u2019 perspective.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b874-14\"> Moreover, I note that this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Frankenmuth Mutual Ins Co v Piccard, </em>440 Mich 539; 489 NW2d 422 (1992), does not support the conclusion of the lead opinion, since only three members of the Court embraced the \"injured\u201d perspective.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b874-15\"> See <em>Piccard, supra </em>at 548; <em>Freeman, supra </em>at 670.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b875-7\"> See <em>Piccard, supra </em>at 557 (Cavanagh, C.J., dissenting).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b876-6\">Levin, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A_x\">(dissenting).

Since the trier of fact decided<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>that the injury was neither expected nor intended by Oaks, the injury was a result of an occurrence/accident although the discharge of the firearm was intentional and Oaks intended to damage Marzonie\u2019s automobile and hence cause property damage.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-5\">i</p>\n<p id=\"b878-6\">Before the 1966 revision of the standard general liability policy, liability policies generally provided coverage for personal injury caused by an \"accident.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Because \"accident\u201d was not defined in the policy, courts developed judicial definitions. There were many definitions<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> designed to implement the fundamental principle that insurance provides coverage for fortuitous losses.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b878-7\">It became well established that where the consequences of intentional acts were unintended, the loss was accidental, and, hence, there was insurance coverage for unintended losses resulting from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>intentional conduct.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> A treatise explains that because \"[f]ortuity, or the lack thereof, is primarily a matter of intent,\u201d in insurance law, \"questions about intent focus on the consequences, not the <em>acts.\u201d </em>(Emphasis in original.)<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b879-4\">Although the concept of fortuity generally involves an analysis whether the insured \"intended the consequences,\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> many courts concluded that the question whether there was an accident should be decided from the standpoint of the injured person.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b879-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b879-6\">The insurance industry accepted the judicial construction that liability policies provide coverage for unintended consequences of intentional acts, but not judicial decisions that provided coverage for \"expected\u201d consequences that the courts were not prepared to find were actually intended. Nor did the industry accept judicial decisions determining coverage from the standpoint of the injured person. As part of a comprehensive revision of the general liability policy, the standard policy was revised in 1966 to exclude coverage where the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>consequences of the insured\u2019s conduct, the injury, was \"expected\u201d as well as where it was actually intended, and to determine whether the injury was expected or intended from the standpoint of the insured rather than the standpoint of the injured person.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b880-6\">The Insuring Clause was revised in 1966 to read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b880-7\">\"The Company will pay on behalf of the Insured all sums which the Insured shall become legally obligated to pay as damages because of bodily injury or property damage to which this insurance applies caused by an occurrence ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b880-8\">\" 'Occurrence\u2019 is defined to mean:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b880-9\">... an accident, including injurious exposure to conditions, which results during the policy period, in bodily injury or property damage neither expected nor intended from the standpoint of the Insured.\u201d[<footnotemark>14</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b880-10\">The insurance policy issued by the Auto Club to Oaks is substantively the same as the 1966 revision of the standard general liability policy. The Auto Club policy provides that it will pay on behalf of the insured sums that the insured becomes legally obligated to pay as damage because of bodily injury \"caused by an occurrence.\u201d The term \"occurrence\u201d is defined to mean \"an accident\u201d that \"results, during the policy term, in bodily injury or property damage.\u201d In a separate clause, the policy excludes coverage for \"bodily injury or property damage which is either ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>pected or intended from the standpoint of the insured.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b881-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b881-6\">The 1966 revision provides coverage for injury caused by an \"occurrence.\u201d \" 'Occurrence\u2019 <em>means </em>an accident.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Thus, coverage is provided for injury caused by accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-7\">It is then provided that a covered accident is one \"which results ... in injury . . . neither expected nor intended from the standpoint of the insured.\u201d Thus, coverage is provided, somewhat circularly, for an injury <em>caused </em>by an accident that <em>results </em>in an injury neither expected nor intended.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-8\">Eliminating the circularity, coverage is provided <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>for an accident that results in bodily injury neither expected nor intended.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-4\">There were a number of components of the various judicial definitions of what constitutes an \"accident,\u201d including the concept that an accident is a \"sudden event which is identifiable in time and place . . . .\u201d In defining \"accident\u201d to include \"injurious exposure to conditions,\u201d the 1966 revision also accepted judicial decisions that eliminated the sudden-and-unexpected-event-identifiable-in-time-and-place requirement.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b882-5\">There were still other components in judicial definitions of accident. Some definitions exclude foreseeable consequences, but, because foreseeability generally equates with negligence, this might mean that there would be no coverage for negligent conduct and \"would result in a liability policy of no significant value to the insured.\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"Ay7\">In <em>Frankenmuth Mutual Ins Co v </em>Piccard, 440 Mich 539, 547; 489 NW2d 422 (1992) (opinion of Riley, J.), the lead opinion<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> observed that in the lead opinion<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> in <em>Allstate Ins Co v Freeman, </em>432 Mich 656; 443 NW2d 734 (1989) (opinion of Riley, C.J.), this Court considered the meaning of \"acci<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>dent,\u201d as used to define \"occurrence,\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> and the following definition was offered:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b883-6\">[A]n accident is an undesigned contingency, a casualty, a happening by chance, something out of the usual course of things, unusual, fortuitous, not anticipated, and not naturally to be expected.[<footnotemark>21</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b883-7\">Since coverage under occurrence-based policies is predicated on a finding of \"accident,\u201d it is understandable that courts continue to address the question whether there is an \"occurrence\u201d/\"accident,\u201d as well as whether the injury was expected or intended. This is nevertheless somewhat circular because it is difficult to conceive of an injurious <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>consequence neither expected nor intended that would not be an accident within the meaning of the coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-5\">An injury neither expected nor intended is \"an undesigned contingency, a casualty, a happening by chance, something out of the usual course of things, unusual, fortuitous, not anticipated, and not naturally to be expected.\u201d As stated by three justices in <em>Piccard, supra, </em>p 548, there may be coverage \"where the intentional conduct will result in unintended and unexpected injury <em>thus constituting an </em>'accident\u2019 . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b884-6\">A finding or conclusion that an injury neither expected nor intended is not an accident would, I venture, stem from misanalysis focusing on the act or conduct of the insured<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> rather than the injurious consequence, and would be contrary to the insurance law principle that \"questions about intent focus on the <em>consequences, </em>not the <em>acts\u201d</em><footnotemark><em>23</em></footnotemark><em> </em>(Emphasis in original.)</p>\n<p id=\"b884-7\">Focusing on the act or conduct would also be contrary to the language of the policy. The act or conduct of the insured giving rise to liability is not in itself an, or the, occurrence. An insured\u2019s act or conduct becomes an \"occurrence\u201d only if it was an accident. And whether the insured\u2019s act or conduct was an accident turns on whether the consequence, the injury\u2014not the act or conduct\u2014was expected or intended._</p>\n<p id=\"b885-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b885-4\">Three justices are of the opinion that the \"accident\u201d inquiry should Continue to be decided from the standpoint of the injured person. This view or reading of the language of the policy is contrary to the 1966 revision\u2019s purpose to determine coverage from the standpoint of the insured and not the standpoint of the injured person.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-5\">The drafters of the 1966 revision did not intend that, while the question whether the <em>injury </em>was expected or intended would be determined from the standpoint of the insured, there would continue to be a separate and preceding inquiry whether there was an <em>\"occurrence\u201d/\"accident\u201d </em>from the standpoint of the injured person.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> As a result of the 1966 revision, adopted in the Auto Club policy, both the coverage and exclusion questions are to be decided from the standpoint of the insured, rather than the standpoint of the injured person.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-6\">Another three justices are similarly of the opinion that there should continue to be a separate and preceding inquiry whether there was an \"occurrence\u201d/\"accident\u201d that was an accident. They conclude that where the intentional conduct re-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>suited in both expected/intended and unexpected/ unintended consequences, the injury was not caused by an \"occurrence\u2019\u2019 / \"accident. \u2019\u2019 I am unable to agree. The 1966 revision\u2019s purpose of precluding coverage where an unintended consequence is expected as well as where the consequence is intended, did not include precluding coverage for unexpected consequences simply because there were other consequences that were expected or intended.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-6\">When it was decided, long before 1966, that unintended consequences of intentional acts were covered unless, since the 1966 revision, the unintended consequence was expected or intended from the standpoint of the insured, it was decided that the focus should be on whether the consequence giving rise to liability was expected or intended, and not the insured\u2019s conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-7\">A single volitional act of an insured may give rise to consequences both expected/intended and unexpected/unintended. In such a case, because a golden thread in insurance law is that \"questions about intent focus on the <em>consequences, </em>not the acts\u201d (emphasis in original),<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> and whether conduct is an accident turns on whether the consequence is expected or intended, it necessarily follows, although one might intuitively feel otherwise, that the single volitional act of the insured gives rise to an \"accident\u201d where the consequence is unexpected/unintended, and to a happening or event that is not an \"accident\u201d where the consequence is expected/intended.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark>_</p>\n<p id=\"b887-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>Since whether conduct is an accident turns on whether the consequence is expected or intended, when the conduct results in both expected/ intended and unexpected/unintended consequences, there is no more reason to conclude that the conduct is not an accident than that it is. To conclude otherwise is to focus on the conduct rather than whether the consequence is expected or intended.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-4\">In many, possibly most, cases, there will be but one consequence of the insured\u2019s conduct, not both unexpected/unintended consequences and expected/intended consequences. Denying coverage for unexpected/unintended consequences where there is adventitiously expected/intended consequences is unexamined line-drawing unrelated to any 1966 revision purpose or the history of adjudication that gave rise to the 1966 revision.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-5\">It truly elevates form over substance to say that the insured and the injured person are unprotected by insurance coverage for the kind of devastating loss that is involved in the instant case because the insured intended comparatively minor damage to Marzonie\u2019s automobile. Defeating coverage in the instant case because comparatively minor property damage was intended is a cramped reading of \"occurrence\u201d/\"accidental\u201d inconsistent with judicial decisions preceding the 1966 revision and the drafting history and purpose of the 1966 revision.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-6\">Having in mind that (i) before the 1966 revision, it was well established that coverage was provided for unintended consequences of intentional acts, and, hence, that intentional conduct was accidental where the injury was unintended, and (ii) \"questions about intent focus on the <em>consequences, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>not the acts\u201d<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> (emphasis in original), and (iii) the purpose of the 1966 revision was to provide coverage where the consequences were expected as well as where they were intended, and not to change the focus from the consequences to the act or conduct of the insured,<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> it is inexplicable that an injury neither expected nor intended is yet not an accident, or becomes not an accident because another injury, particularly one, as here, comparatively minor was intended.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-6\">iii</p>\n<p id=\"b888-7\">The meritorious question is whether the injury suffered by Marzonie was expected or intended from the standpoint of Oaks, the insured. Three justices conclude that the injury was expected or intended, and three do not reach that question because they decide that there was no occurrence/ accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-8\">In <em>Buczkowski v Allstate Ins Co, </em>447 Mich 669; 526 NW2d 589 (1994), decided the day after <em>Marzonie </em>was decided, this Court affirms a decision of the Court of Appeals that Allstate had a duty to indemnify its insured for injuries suffered by Buczkowski when the insured fired his shotgun with the intent of hitting Buczkowski\u2019s truck but a bullet ricocheted and hit Buczkowski. The majority of the Court of Appeals, in an unreported opinion, found that whether the injury \"may reasonably be expected to result\u201d from the insured\u2019s actions within the meaning of an exclusion in the Allstate policy<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> was a question of fact for the jury._</p>\n<p id=\"b889-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>This Court affirmed in <em>Buczkowski, </em>three justices agreeing with the reasoning of the Court of Appeals, and one justice concurring in that result. I- signed both opinions for affirmance.

I signed the lead opinion because I agree with the other signers of that opinion and the Court of Appeals that ordinarily the question what is expected or intended by the insured, whether assessed subjectively or objectively, should be decided by the trier of fact.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b890-6\"><em>Buczkowski </em>and <em>Marzonie </em>are distinguishable on the basis that the vehicle in <em>Buczkowski </em>was unoccupied and the vehicle in <em>Marzonie </em>was occupied. While this factual difference is important, and it is, indeed, more likely that personal injury will result from the firing of a gun at an occupied vehicle than at an unoccupied vehicle, a court may not in effect direct a verdict for the insurer declaring that there is no coverage unless\u2014where the question arises (as in <em>Czopek, DiCicco, Piccard </em>and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number><em>Marzonie</em><footnotemark><em>32</em></footnotemark><em>) </em>under the occurrence-based language of the 1966 revision of the standard general liability policy\u2014all reasonable persons must agree that personal injury was subjectively<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> expected or intended, or\u2014where the question arises (as in <em>Freeman </em>and <em>Buczkowski) </em>under the Allstate policy\u2014 all reasonable persons must agree that personal injury was objectively<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> reasonably to be expected.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>Courts in other jurisdictions have generally held that where the facts are in dispute, or where differing inferences may reasonably be drawn from undisputed facts, the question whether injury is expected or intended is to be decided by a trier of fact and not by the court as a matter of law.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> A number of cases so holding involved injuries caused by the discharge of firearms.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b893-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>Since it appears that a subjective standard<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> is stated in the Auto Club\u2019s policy and an objective standard in the Allstate policy, one would think that there is less reason to decide, as a matter of law, the question whether Oaks expected or intended to injure Marzonie than whether McKay expected or intended to injure Buczkowski.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-4\">I would hold that it was for the trier of fact, and not for this Court as a matter of law,<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> to decide on the basis of the facts and circumstances of the discharge by Oaks<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> of the firearm, whether Oaks <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>expected or intended to cause the personal injury suffered by Marzonie, and thus whether what occurred was accidental and covered by the policy of insurance issued by Auto Club.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b876-9\"> <em>Ante, </em>p 644, Riley, J., Boyle and Mallett, JJ., concurring.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b876-10\"> <em>Id., </em>p 627.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b876-11\"> Marzonie, Vernon Oaks, and the occupants of their vehicles became embroiled in a dispute in November, 1986, while stopped at an intersection near Flint.

Oaks retrieved a shotgun, with which he claims he hoped to scare Marzonie, and went outside.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-6\">Marzonie\u2019s vehicle began to creep up the driveway. Oaks aimed the gun at the vehicle\u2019s grill and fired a shot in the hope, he said, of preventing the vehicle from approaching closer. After the first shot failed to fire, Oaks fired again. Oaks did not see the second shot hit the vehicle, and thought he had missed. Unbeknownst to Oaks, the shot had struck Marzonie. Marzonie\u2019s vehicle began to back up, turned, and then started to move away. Oaks aimed a third shot at the rear tires in an effort to stop the vehicle. This shot did not fire. Finally, Oaks fired a fourth shot that hit one of the rear tires.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-7\">Auto Club commenced this action, seeking a declaration that coverage under a homeowner\u2019s policy issued to Oaks\u2019 parents was excluded.
