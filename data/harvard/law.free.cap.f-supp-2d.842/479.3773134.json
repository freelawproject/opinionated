(collectively, \u201cdefendants\u201d). Defendants\u2019 motion seeks dismissal of the claims of all remaining plaintiffs in this consolidated multi-district proceeding \u2014 specifically, Jane Clark (a/k/a Hazel Jane Clark), Marjorie McDonald, Christopher Raso (o/b/o Susan Raso), Sylvia Rose, Karen Shareff, Betty Anne Woodward, Carol Strong (successor: Stacy Strong), Skyla Whaley (o/b/o Doris Whaley), and Cynthia Burke (o/b/o Ed Burke) (collectively, \u201cplaintiffs\u201d) \u2014 in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in <em>PLIVA, Inc. v.

Mem.\u201d).)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Plaintiffs have not opposed the motion and have indicated that they do not seek to do so.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> For the reasons that follow, defendants\u2019 unopposed motion to dismiss is granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-17\">\n<em>BACKGROUND</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b519-18\">On December 2, 2009, this multi-district litigation (\u201cMDL\u201d) was transferred to this court by the United States Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation. (ECF No. 1-3, MDL Transfer Order, filed 12/2/2009.) The MDL Transfer Order described the cases as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-19\">All actions share factual questions relating to generic equivalents of Aredia<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>, a brand name prescription drug. Plaintiffs in all actions challenge the safety of these generic equivalents and allege that they developed osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> or have a higher risk for devel<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>oping ONJ, because of their infusion with those pharmaceutical products.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b520-4\"><em>(Id. </em>at 1.) Plaintiffs are all individuals or their decedents who were given the generic drug pamidronate<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and developed ONJ. (See Case No. 10-CV-1860, ECF No. 10, Second Amended Complaint, filed 1/6/2011 (\u201cCompl.\u201d) \u00b6 6.) On January 6, 2011, plaintiffs filed a Second Amended Complaint (\u201cComplaint\u201d). <em>(See id.) </em>The Complaint alleges that as a result of being infused with generic pamidronate, plaintiffs developed ONJ and suffered injuries. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 31-32.) Plaintiffs seek damages from defendants based on theories of design defect, failure to warn, negligence, breach of express warranty, and breach of implied warranty. (Id. \u00b6\u00b6 33-60.)</p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">On April 26, 2011, defendants served plaintiffs with a motion to dismiss the Complaint, which plaintiffs opposed on June 10, 2011. Following the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Mensing </em>on June 23, 2011, this court stayed further briefing on the pending motion to dismiss while the parties considered the impact of that decision and/or whether plaintiffs\u2019 claims against defendants would be voluntarily dismissed. <em>(See </em>ECF No. 128, Letter Request for Extension of Deadline to File Reply Briefs by APP Pharmaceuticals, LLC, filed 6/27/2011; ECF No. 130, Letter re Status by APP Pharmaceuticals, LLC, filed 8/8/2011; ECF No. 131, Letter MOTION for Extension of Time to File Response/Reply Brief in Support of Motion to Dismiss by APP Pharmaceuticals, LLC, filed 8/8/2011.) Of the 134 plaintiffs included in the MDL, 125 plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed their claims by December 28, 2011. Pursuant to an Order dated November 25, 2011 (Order . dated 11/25/2011), on January 6, 2012, defendants filed the instant motion to dismiss the remaining nine plaintiffs\u2019 claims <em>(see </em>ECF No. 157, Notice of Motion, filed 1/6/2012; ECF No. 158, Def. Mem.).</p>\n<p id=\"b520-10\">\n<em>DISCUSSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"A-F\">I. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b520-11\">A. Motion To Dismiss</p>\n<p id=\"b520-12\">Defendants move to dismiss the Complaint pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim. <em>(See </em>ECF No. 158, Def. Mem. at 1.) In considering a motion to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), the court construes the complaint liberally, \u201caccepting all factual allegations in the complaint as true, and drawing all reasonable inferences in the plaintiffs favor.\u201d <em>Chambers v. Time Warner, Inc., </em>282 F.3d 147, 152 (2d Cir. 2002) (citing <em>Gregory v. Daly, </em>243 F.3d 687, 691 (2d Cir.2001)). In order to survive a motion to dismiss, the complaint must set forth factual allegations sufficient \u201cto raise a right to relief above a speculative level.\u201d <em>Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, </em>550 U.S. 544, 555, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007). The court need not credit \u201clegal conclusions\u201d in the complaint or \u201cthreadbare recitals of the elements of a cause of action, supported by mere conclusory statements.\u201d <em>Harris v. Mills, </em>572 F.3d 66, 72 (2d Cir.2009) (quoting <em>Ashcroft v. Iqbal, </em>556 U.S. 662, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 1949, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009)) (internal quotation marks and alteration omitted). A motion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>to dismiss should be granted when, viewing the facts in the light most favorable to the non-moving party, the complaint fails to state a claim upon which relief may be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">B. Law of Preemption</p>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">The Supremacy Clause of the United States Constitution provides that federal law \u201cshall be the supreme Law of the Land ... any Thing in the Constitution or Laws of any State to the Contrary notwithstanding.\u201d U.S. Const. art. VI, cl. 2. Implied preemption, which is at issue here, occurs when it is \u201cimpossible for a private party to comply with both state and federal requirements.\u201d <em>Freightliner Corp. v. Myrick, </em>514 U.S. 280, 287, 115 S.Ct. 1483, 131 L.Ed.2d 385 (1995) (citation omitted); <em>accord U.S. Smokeless Tobacco Mfg. Co., LLC v. City of New York, </em>703 F.Supp.2d 329, 334 (S.D.N.Y.2010). In other words, \u201c[w]here state and federal law \u2018directly conflict,\u2019 state law must give way.\u201d <em>Mensing, </em>131 S.Ct. at 2577 (quoting <em>Wyeth v. Levine, </em>555 U.S. 555, 583, 129 S.Ct. 1187, 173 L.Ed.2d 51 (2009) (Thomas, J., concurring in judgment)).</p>\n<p id=\"b521-7\">In <em>PLLVA, Inc. v. Mensing, </em>plaintiffs brought failure to warn claims under state law against several generic manufacturers of the drug metoclopramide. <em>Mensing, </em>131 S.Ct. at 2573. Plaintiffs alleged that the generic manufacturers violated state tort laws by failing to change the labels for metoclopramide to adequately warn of the risk of a severe neurological disorder. <em>Id. </em>The applicable state tort laws required manufacturers that are \u201cor should be aware of [their] product\u2019s danger to label that product in a way that renders it reasonably safe.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The manufacturers, on the other hand, argued that under federal regulations, the generic manufacturers had a duty of \u201csameness\u201d \u2014 that is, \u201cthe warning labels of a brand-name drug and its generic copy must always be the same.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2574-75. The Supreme Court held that the plaintiffs failure to warn claims under state law were preempted by federal law because \u201cit was impossible for the Manufacturers to comply with both their state-law duty to change the label and their federal law duty to keep the label the same.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2578.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-10\">II. Application</p>\n<p id=\"b521-11\">Defendants move to dismiss the Complaint, arguing that plaintiffs\u2019 state law tort claims are either preempted by federal regulations applicable to generic drugs such as pamidronate or are inadequately pled under federal pleading standards. (ECF No. 158, Def. Mem. at 1, 10.) The court agrees.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b522-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>A. Failure To Warn</p>\n<p id=\"b522-4\">Plaintiffs\u2019 claims of failure to warn are squarely preempted by <em>Mensing. </em>Plaintiffs claim that defendants \u201cknew or should have known about the possible adverse side effects of pamidronate\u201d but nevertheless failed to satisfy their state law duty to provide \u201cproper warnings regarding possible adverse side effects\u201d of the drug. (Case No. 10-CV-1860, ECF No. 10, Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 42^43.) In essence, therefore, plaintiffs\u2019 argument is that defendants should have altered the labeling of pamidronate to provide stronger warnings about the drug\u2019s possible adverse side effects. However, federal drug regulations \u201cdemand[ ] that generic drug labels be the same at all times as the corresponding brand-name drug labels.\u201d <em>Mensing, </em>131 S.Ct. at 2578. If defendants \u201chad independently changed their labels to satisfy their state-law duty, they would have violated federal law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus, under the Supreme Court\u2019s reasoning in <em>Mensing, </em>plaintiffs failure to warn claims are dismissed as preempted.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">B. Design Defect</p>\n<p id=\"b522-6\"> Plaintiffs\u2019 claims alleging defective design are also preempted by federal law. In <em>Mensing, </em>the Supreme Court found that a generic drug is \u201cdesigned to be a copy of a reference listed drug (typically a brand-name drug)\u201d and it must be \u201cidentical in active ingredients, safety, and efficacy.\u201d <em>Mensing, </em>131 S.Ct. at 2574 n. 2. Thus, the \u201cfederal duty of \u2018sameness,\u2019 \u201d <em>id. </em>af 2575, also applies in the context of generic drug design, and federal law preempts state laws imposing a duty to change a drug\u2019s design on generic drug manufacturers, <em>see In re Fosamax Prods. Liab. Litig. (No. II), </em>MDL No. 2243, Civ. No. 08-008, 2011 WL 5903623, at *6, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 135006, at *33-34 (D.N.J. Nov. 21, 2011) (finding state law design defect claims preempted pursuant to Mensing); <em>Stevens v. Pliva, Inc., </em>6:10-0886, 2011 WL 6224569, at *2, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 147684, at *5-6 (W.D.La. Nov. 15, 2011) (same). Accordingly, plaintiffs\u2019 design defect claims are dismissed.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b522-9\">C. Negligence</p>\n<p id=\"b522-10\">Plaintiffs allege that defendants \u201cfailed to exercise reasonable care in testing, manufacturing, labeling, marketing, distributing and selling pamidronate....\u201d (Case No. 10-CV-1860, ECF No. 10, Compl. \u00b6 48.) First, allegations that the labeling, marketing, distributing, and selling of pamidronate failed to meet a certain standard of reasonable care are preempted pursuant to <em>Mensing </em>because these allegations are in essence failure to warn claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-11\">Second, plaintiffs\u2019 allegations of negligence based on the failure to exercise reasonable care in testing and manufacturing pamidronate fail because the Complaint merely makes a conclusory allegation of negligence, without any factual support for this cause of action. Indeed, the factual allegations as to wrongdoing by defendants contained in paragraphs 23 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>through 30 of the Complaint are all allegations that defendants knew of the potential adverse effects of pamidronate and provided inadequate information regarding the harm that pamidronate may cause. <em>(See id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 23-30.) Thus, plaintiffs have provided no more than a \u201csheer possibility\u201d that defendants defectively tested and manufactured pamidronate. <em>Iqbal, </em>129 S.Ct. at 1949. Plaintiffs\u2019 \u201cformulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action will not do.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Twombly, </em>550 U.S. at 555, 127 S.Ct. 1955). Thus, plaintiffs\u2019 claims that defendants were negligent are dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-5\">D. Breach of Express Warranty</p>\n<p id=\"b523-6\">Plaintiffs\u2019 claim based on breach of express warranty is in essence a failure to warn claim, and thus is preempted pursuant to <em>Mensing. </em>Plaintiffs allege that defendants made false statements or representations that pamidronate was \u201csafe, effective, and fit for its intended uses.\u201d (Case No. 10-CV1860, ECF No. 10, Compl. \u00b6 52.) Plaintiffs attack the accuracy of these representations by alleging that pamidronate \u201ccaused serious adverse side effects, including ONJ.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 54.) This claim suggests that defendants should have changed or omitted the allegedly inaccurate statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-7\">Federal law, however, forbids a generic drug manufacturer from unilaterally changing, omitting, or strengthening drug labeling. <em>See Mensing, </em>131 S.Ct. at 2578 (\u201c[S]tate law imposed on the Manufacturers a duty to attach a safer label to their generic [drug]. Federal law however, demanded that generic drug labels be the same at all times as the corresponding brand-name drug labels.\u201d). Here, defendants could not unilaterally change their pamidronate labels pursuant to state law and simultaneously comply with their federal law duty of sameness. Accordingly, plaintiffs\u2019 breach of express warranty claims are preempted and dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-9\">E. Breach of Implied Warranty</p>\n<p id=\"b523-10\">Plaintiffs\u2019 breach of implied warranty claims are also preempted. Plaintiffs allege that defendants \u201cimpliedly warranted to Plaintiffs and/or their decedents ... and/or their agents, that pamidronate was of merchantable quality and was safe and fit for its intended uses,\u201d but that the drug \u201cwas not of merchantable quality or safe and fit for its intended uses.... \u201d (Case No. 10-CV-1860, ECF No. 10, Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 57, 59.) Because this cause of action is founded on the argument that pamidronate should have been designed differently, it fails for the same reasons previously explained in the court\u2019s analysis of the design defect claims. Plaintiffs\u2019 breach of implied warranty claim necessarily alleges that defendants should have changed the design of pamidronate to make it \u201csafe and fit for its intended uses.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 59.) Pursuant to defendants\u2019 \u201cfederal duty of \u2018sameness,\u2019 \u201d <em>Mensing, </em>131 S.Ct. at 2575, however, defendants were prohibited by federal law from changing the design of pamidronate. Thus, plaintiffs\u2019 breach of implied warranty claims are preempted and dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-11\">\n<em>CONCLUSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b523-12\">For the reasons stated above, defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss the claims of all remaining plaintiffs is granted.

In dismissing plaintiffs\u2019 claims, the court joins numerous other district courts that have found claims against generic drug manufacturers to be preempted by <em>Mensing. See, e.g., In re Fosamax Prods. Liab. Litig. (Mo. II), </em>MDL No. 2243, Civ. No. 08-008, 2011 WL 5903623, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 135006 (D.N.J.

Plaintiffs' allegations of design defect also fail because they are not supported by factual \u2018 allegations in the Complaint.
