Defendant William J. Rose appeals from his misdemeanor conviction of the same Penal Code section for sale of the same book. Another misdemeanor charge against defendant Rose for sale of obscene films (different from the Adler films) was dismissed upon motion of the People after the jury\u2019s inability to reach a general verdict although having rendered a special verdict that one of the films was not obscene; the court ordered the entry of a verdict of not guilty as to the defendant Benjamin Carl Adler on another charge of sale of obscene film after the juiy was unable to arrive at a general verdict but did render a special verdict that the particular film in question (different from the first two Adler films) was not obscene. The defendants appeal from the judgments of conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1093-5\">At the trial, it was shown that appellant Adler on October 14, 1967, sold two films to a district attorney\u2019s investigator; four days later, two other films were seized from the trunk of Adler\u2019s car, pursuant to a search warrant. On May 8, 1968, the book \u201cLove Together\u201d was purchased by a sheriff\u2019s detective from a sales clerk in the Fulton Book Store, owned by defendant Rose. On June 6, 1968, the same book \u201cLove Together\u201d was purchased by the chief deputy district attorney of Sacramento County, from a sales clerk in the K Street Book Store owned by appellant Adler. The prosecution further presented expert testimony that the films and book are obscene by statewide standards and the films and book were received into evidence, over objection. Appellants presented expert testimony that the items were not obscene, either by state or national attitudes. Each side fortified its contention by rebuttal and sur-rebuttal testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b1093-6\">Appellants contend: (1) The book \u201cLove Together\u201d is not obscene; (2) misinstruction to the jury on the element of social importance; (3) misinstruction to the jury of a statewide rather than nationwide community: (4) insufficiency of the proof and misinstruction on the element of scienter; (5) unlawful seizure of films because the warrant was general and over-broad, and the seizure was without a prior adversary hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1093-9\">In order to consider the defendants\u2019 contentions, it is necessary to bring into its most current focus the general rules relative to obscenity as articulated by the United States Supreme Court. In <em>Roth </em>v. <em>United States, </em>(1957) 354 U.S. 476 [1 L.Ed.2d 1498, 77 S.Ct. 1304], and its companion case of <em>Alberts </em>v. <em>California </em>convictions under federal obscenity statutes punishing the mailing of obscene, lewd, lascivious or filthy material, and convictions under the California statute proscribing the keeping for sale or advertising of material that is obscene or indecent were affirmed. Against the contention that such matters were protected as free speech <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"Supp. 28\">*Supp. 28</page-number>under the First Amendment to the United States Constitution, the court squarely determined that obscenity is <em>not </em>within the area of constitutionally protected speech or press.</p>\n<p id=\"b1094-4\">Whether spawned or encouraged by the dissenting views expressed in <em>Roth, </em>subsequent judicial expression did lend growing support to the view that, at least because of its difficulty of definition and/or because of the lack of agreement as to what in fact is obscene, obscenity was no longer a valid subject for statutory prohibition. It would now appear that the high-water mark of the view that obscenity is \u201cconstitutionally protected\u201d was <em>Stanley </em>v. <em>Georgia </em>(1969) 394 U.S. 557 [22 L.Ed.2d 542, 89 S.Ct. 1243], which held that the mere private possession of obscene matter cannot constitutionally be made a crime. The \u201cright to receive\u201d obscene materials spoken of in <em>Stanley </em>was thereafter interpreted in the lower federal courts as providing constitutional protection to obscenity for its very content. (See for example <em>Karalexis </em>v. <em>Byrne </em>(W.D. Pa. 1969) 306 F. Supp. 1363, later overruled in <em>Byrne </em>v. <em>Karalexis </em>(1971) 401 U.S. 216 [27 L.Ed.2d 792, 91 S.Ct. 777].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1094-6\">These contentions were on May 3, 1971, squarely rejected by the United States Supreme Court in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Reidel, </em>402 U.S. 351 [28 L.Ed.2d 813, 91 S.Ct. 1410] and <em>United States </em>v. <em>Thirty-Seven Photographs, </em>402 U.S. 363 [28 L.Ed.2d 822, 91 S.Ct. 1400] both of which reassert that obscenity is <em>not </em>within the area of constitutionally protected speech or press and that <em>Roth </em>has <em>not </em>been overruled and <em>does </em>remain the law. The opinion of the court in <em>Reidel, </em>by Mr. Justice White points out that: \u201c[respondent] Reidel . . . stands squarely on a claimed First Amendment right to do business in obscenity and use the mails in the process. But <em>Roth </em>has squarely placed obscenity and its distribution outside the reach of the First Amendment and they remain there today. <em>Stanley </em>did not overrule <em>Roth </em>and we decline to do so now.\u201d (402 U.S. 351 at p. 356 [28 L.Ed.2d 813 at p. 818, 91 S.Ct. 1410 at p. 1413].) And the concurring opinion of Mr. Justice Harlan in <em>Reidel </em>is equally positive (402 U.S. at p. 358 [28 L.Ed.2d at p. 819, 91 S.Ct. at p. 1414]): <em>\u201cEither Roth means </em>that government may proscribe obscenity as such rather than merely regulate it with reference to other state interests, or <em>Roth </em>means nothing at all. And <em>Stanley, </em>far from overruling <em>Roth, </em>did not even purport to- limit that case to its facts: \u2018We hold that the First and Fourteenth Amendments prohibit making mere private possession of obscene material a crime. <em>Roth </em>and the cases following that decision are not impaired by today\u2019s holding . . . .\u2019 394 U.S. at 568.\u201d The \u201cright to receive\u201d discussed in <em>Stanley </em>is thus clarified to- refer simply to the privacy of a man\u2019s thoughts rather than modes of commercial or other distribution. The area of obscenity then remains properly one for legislation reflecting the philosophies and the desires of the populace as reflected - <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"Supp. 29\">*Supp. 29</page-number>by their elected representatives. Those differing philosophies, that obscenity should be prohibited, or that obscenity should merely be regulated to insulate the young (see for example the majority and dissenting opinions in <em>People </em>v. <em>Luros, </em>4 Cal.3d 84 [92 Cal.Rptr. 833, 480 P.2d 633], decided on Feb. 18, 1971, before <em>United States </em>v. <em>Reidel, </em>supra) are recognized as being reserved for the legislative expression of the states: \u201cThis may prove to be the desirable and eventual legislative course. But if it is, the task of restructuring the obscenity laws lies with those who pass, repeal, and amend statutes and ordinances. <em>Roth </em>and like cases pose no obstacle to such developments.\u201d <em>(United States </em>v. <em>Reidel, supra, </em>402 U.S. at n. 357 [28 L.Ed. 2d at p. 818, 91 S.Ct. at p. 1413].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1095-5\">Penal Code section 311.2, as it read at the time of these offenses provided: \u201cEvery person who knowingly [:] sends or causes to be sent, or brings or causes to be brought, into this state for sale or distribution, or in this state prepares, publishes, prints, exhibits, distributes, or offers to distribute, or has in his possession with intent to distribute or to exhibit or offer to distribute any obscene matter is guilty of a misdemeanor.\u201d Against this statutory language we turn to a consideration of appellants\u2019 contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1095-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b1095-7\">They first urge that \u201cThe book \u2018Love Together\u2019 is not obscene and that Penal Code 311.2 as construed and applied to authorize the judgments of conviction rendered against the defendants herein based upon the sale of the said book violates the free speech and press, due process and equal protection provisions of the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution, violates the parallel provisions of the State Constitution and the rulings of the United States Supreme Court and other Federal and State Courts holding comparable books to be entitled to constitutional protection.\u201d In support of this contention, appellants urge that explicit description of sexual activity in a book is not synonymous with obscenity and that questions of taste are ultimately a matter for the public to decide for itself. Appellants then cite a number of cases holding other books, which they allege to be completely comparable to \u201cLove Together,\u201d not obscene. Respondent counters with case citations as to still other publications which have been held obscene as that term is defined in <em>Roth, supra, </em>as well as its testimonial evidence of the obscenity of \u201cLove Together.\u201d  Having reviewed the book, as this court must under <em>Zeitlin </em>v. <em>Arnebergh </em>(1963) 59 Cal.2d 901 [31 Cal.Rptr. 800, 383 P.2d 152, 10 A.L.R.3d 707] and applying the three-pronged <em>Roth </em>test which was enacted into the definition of \u201cObscene,\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> this court has no difficulty in stating that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"Supp. 30\">*Supp. 30</page-number>the dominant theme of the book taken as a whole appeals to a prurient interest in nudity and sex. It is a vile and pointless recitation of continuously repeated heterosexual, homosexual and lesbian copulation and coupling\u2014oral, genital and anal\u2014all of orgiastic proportion, frequently involving more than two subjects, and early degenerating to sadism, torture and masochism. It is patently offensive and does affront contemporary community standards relating to the description or representation of such matters, and is material which is utterly without redeeming social value.</p>\n<p id=\"b1096-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1096-5\">Appellant\u2019s second contention is that \u201cPenal Code Section 311.2 as construed and applied to authorize the judgments of conviction herein upon an uncontroverted record showing that the films involved herein are not utterly without redeeming social importance and upon the giving of instructions and the refusal to instruct as requested by appellants with respect to the element of social importance, violates the free speech, due process and equal protection provisions of the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution and the parallel State constitutional guarantees.\u201d The first part of this contention is that the prosecution failed to adduce any evidence that the films are utterly without redeeming social importance, whereas appellants did produce several witnesses who affirmatively testified that the films <em>did </em>have redeeming social importance, so that, appellants urge, the record is then uncontroverted that the films did have redeeming social importance and therefore cannot provide the basis for an obscenity prosecution. Respondents\u2019 answer is to point to their expert testimony that the films had no artistic merit, had no-story, no relationship that changed, no dialogue, or communication, nor did they have psychological value. In this court\u2019s view the net effect of such testimony is that the material is utterly without redeeming social importance, and the failure to use those specific words does not diminish the evidentiary import of the words actually used as supportive of that conclusion. Additionally, appellant\u2019s argument overlooks the films themselves which were viewed by the jury and,- by their verdict, were obviously without redeeming social importance to that jury. This court, having viewed the films pursuant to <em>Zeitlin </em>v. <em>Amebergh, supra, </em>heartily concurs. The films are hard-core pornography and nothing more; they depict only sexual intercourse, oral copulation, masturbation and self-manipulation, for no purpose other than a depiction of the activity of the moment, whether it be individual, mutual by two- persons of the same <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"Supp. 31\">*Supp. 31</page-number>or opposite sex, or group by more than two persons. The portrayals can appeal to nothing <em>except </em>a prurient interest in sex and nudity; they do substantially exceed customary or even reasonable limits of candor, and having no purpose other than explicit depiction of sexual activity, can have no conceivable redeeming social importance. It is thus unnecessary to reach a consideration of <em>People </em>v. <em>Newton, 9 </em>Cal.App.3d Supp. 24 [88 Cal.Rptr. 343] which the People cite as holding that if prurient interest and limits of candor are established by the evidence, the burden of going forward with evidence that there is some redeeming social importance is placed upon the defense, and the appellants\u2019 violent disputation of <em>Newton </em>as having been wrongly decided in that the matter of redeeming social importance is an element of the offense itself which must be established positively by the People. The films themselves, being evidence in the case, in conjunction with the prosecution\u2019s testimony already adverted to, more than cover the People\u2019s burden of proof on the element of social importance.</p>\n<p id=\"b1097-5\">Appellants further contend the jury was misdirected and misinstructed, by application of the concepts of the average person and contemporary standards to the element of social importance, appellants\u2019 urging that no such restrictions on that element (\u201cutterly without redeeming social importance\u201d) were either contemplated by the Legislature in enacting the statute nor are such restrictions permissible under the federal Constitution, citing <em>Roth, </em>supra: \u201cAll ideas having even the slightest redeeming social importance\u2014unorthodox ideas, controversial ideas, even ideas hateful to the prevailing climate of opinion\u2014have the full protection of the guarantees ... [of the First Amendment].\u201d (Italics added.) (354 U.S. at p. 484.) and <em>Zeitlin </em>v. <em>Arnebergh, supra: </em>\u201cBy [implying] the terms \u2018utterly\u2019 the Legislature indicated its intention to give legal sanction to all material relating to sex except that which was totally devoid of social importance.\u201d (59 Cal.2d at p. 920.) Thus appellants contend that if the evidence shows that the matter has some social value, however slight, the matter cannot constitutionally be found obscene even if the average man, applying contemporary standards, would conclude that the matter is utterly without redeeming social importance. The court refused to instruct the jury, as requested by appellants, that: \u201cthe question of whether the matter is utterly without redeeming social importance is not measured by what the average person believes to have social importance but whether in fact the matter is utterly without redeeming value.\u201d And: \u201cAll ideas, having even the slightest redeeming social importance\u2014unorthodox ideas, controversial ideas, even ideas hateful to the prevailing climate of opinion\u2014have the full protection of the guarantees, unless excludable because they encroach upon the limited area of more important interests.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1098-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"Supp. 32\">*Supp. 32</page-number>The relevant instructions as given to the jury in their entirety were as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1098-4\">\u201cAs used in these instructions \u2018obscene\u2019 means that to the average person, applying contemporary standards, the predominant appeal of the matter taken as a whole, is to prurient interest, i.e., a shameful or morbid interest in nudity, sex, or excretion, which goes substantially beyond customary limits of candor in description or representation of such matters and is matter which is utterly without redeeming social importance.\u201d (Pen. Code, \u00a7 311, subd. (a).)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1098-5\">\u201cThat an average person, applying contemporary standards, would conclude that: ... (3) the material is utterly without redeeming social importance.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1098-6\">\u201cThe contemporary standard to' which the law makes reference is set by what is, in fact, accepted and not by what some persons or groups of persons may believe the community as a whole ought to accept or refuse to accept.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1098-7\">\u201cYou are instructed that, for purposes of determining the obscenity of the material here in question, the relevant community is the entire State of California.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1098-8\">\u201cThe matter must be measured by its appeal to the average person. The average person is, of course, .determined by a synthesis of the entire community, including persons of all sexes, religions, nationalities, creeds, ages, et cetera, but once the jury has determined the average person it must be remembered that the matter must be measured by such average person, and not by young persons or the susceptible.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1098-9\">\u201cPutting this in still another manner: In determining who is an average person under the definition of obscenity which I have previously given to you, you are to consider society as a whole, young and old, educated and uneducated, the religious and the irreligous, men, women and children.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1098-10\">\u201cThe word \u2018redeeming\u2019 in the context herein refers not to a balancing of the alleged pruriency against the social importance of the material, but rather to the presence of matters of social importance in the content which will recover for the material its position as constitutionally protected utterance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1098-11\">\u201cTo be of social importance the matter must be of value to society; thus a matter that is of no value to society is utterly without redeeming social importance.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1099-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"Supp. 33\">*Supp. 33</page-number>\u201cUnder the law, the word \u2018utterly\u2019 which appears in the definition has been defined in the law as follows: to an absolute or extreme degree; to the full extent; absolutely; altogether; entirely; fully; thoroughly; totally.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1099-5\">\u201cIn determining whether or not the matter has social importance you may consider among other things if it deals with the basic realities of life as the artist sees it; if it is a serious work of art; and if it honestly probes social values.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1099-6\">\u201cA work designed to entertain or amuse is as much entitled to the protection of free speech as a scientific or educational work.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1099-7\">\u201cA motion picture film or books have social importance if they have the capacity to broaden man\u2019s range of sympathies or consciousness, or to enable him to see, hear, or appreciate what he might otherwise have missed, or deepens his emotions, or makes life seem richer, more interesting or more comprehensible, or provides insights into man\u2019s relationship to the society in which he lives. A film or book may have social importance even if they appear worthless to the average person or to- most people.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1099-8\">\u201cYour own personal and social views on material such as that charged in the complaint may not be considered. Thus, whether you believe that the material is good or bad is of no concern; so, too, you may not consider whether in your opinion the material is moral or immoral; whether it is likely to be helpful or injurious to- the public morals. Similarly, whether you like or dislike the material; whether it offends or shocks you, may not be considered by you. You may think the material is immoral, shocking or offensive, and yet you must acquit the defendant if it is not obscene as the Court has defined that term for you.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1099-9\">\u201cYou are instructed that Section 311.8 of the Penal Code provides that it shall be a defense, in any prosecution for violation of Section 311.2 of the Penal Code, that the act charged was committed in aid of legitimate, scientific, or educational purposes.\u201d (Pen. Code, \u00a7 311.8.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1099-10\">Respondent contends that when considered in their entirety, the instructions mean that the personal standards of the jurors could not be used, that the standards of the community were to be used to determine if the material had the least value to any segment of society, and that the question was not whether the average man would conclude that the material had some value to him, but rather whether the average man would conclude that the material had some value to someone. Respondent further contends that the instruction actually given is more restrictive than required because the community standards concept need only be used to test the customary limits of candor portion of the three-pronged <em>Roth </em>test. <em>(Mishkin </em>v. <em>New </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"Supp. 34\">*Supp. 34</page-number><em>York </em>(1966) 383 U.S. 502 [16 L.Ed.2d 56, 86 S.Ct. 958]; <em>In re van Geldern </em>(1971) 14 Cal.App.3d 838 [92 Cal.Rptr. 592].) Finally, respondent concludes that the error, if any, was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt and therefore not reversible.</p>\n<p id=\"b1100-4\">There was no error of instruction. In their totality, the instructions given more than amply voiced the <em>Roth </em>and <em>Zeitlin </em>scope of protection to ideas having <em>any </em>redeeming social importance, so that the court did actually give, although not in the appellants\u2019 particularly chosen words, the direction that matters of any redeeming social importance, though unpopular or even personally distasteful, cannot be found obscene.</p>\n<p id=\"b1100-5\">There then remains appellants objection to the \u201caverage person applying contemporary standards\u201d as to redeeming social importance. Assuming arguendo that this concept applies to more than the \u201ccustomary limits of candor\u201d prong of <em>Roth, </em>the language read to the jury was that of the statute itself, and the court then fully amplified and explained that statutory language, and the constitutional limits thereon. (Cf. <em>People </em>v. <em>Thomas </em>(1945) 25 Cal.2d 880, 895 [156 P.2d 7].) Implicit in the opinion in <em>Zeitlin </em>v. <em>Arnebergh, supra, </em>involving this same statute, is the rejection of appellants\u2019 contention. There, while considering \u201caverage person\u201d specifically relative to predominant appeal to prurient interest, the court observes: \u201cFinally, we do not believe that the definition of \u2018obscene\u2019 material as that which \u2018to the <em>average person </em>. . . predominant appeal ... is to prurient interest . . .\u2019 (italics added) indicates that the ultimate determination of that question is always for the jury. These words fix a <em>standard </em>which is to be applied to the material; they do not designate the body which is to apply the standard. The statutory language does not inherently predicate a question for the jury; it merely frames a definition. As we hereinafter point out, the Legislature wrote the words \u2018average man\u2019 into the statute because a lesser standard would offend constitutional guarantees; the phrase does not serve to mark the respective spheres of the court and jury.\u201d (59 Cal.2d at p. 911.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1100-6\">The court then discusses <em>Roth </em>and subsequent cases, recites how the Legislature, cognizant of the applicable constitutional guarantees, wrote a statute which in substance prohibited hard-core pornography as the only material \u201cutterly\" devoid of social importance and construes \u201credeeming\" as <em>not </em>balancing pruriency against social importance. The court then puts itself to the task of applying those principles for the purpose of determining the question of fact mixed with determination of law (\u201cconstitutional fact\u201d), the obscenity or not of \u201cTropic of Cancer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1100-7\">The instructions here given to the jury accurately reflect the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"Supp. 35\">*Supp. 35</page-number>\u201cstandard which is to be applied to the material\u2019 <em>(Zeitlin </em>v. <em>Arnebergh, </em>supra), even though that same standard is ultimately applied by the court itself, and that is, not what any individual may want subjectively but whether the material could, objectively, have or be of some value to someone. There was no misdirection of the jury, and by its own independent review and evaluation of the films and book forming the basis of appellants\u2019 convictions, this court finds those materials to be utterly without redeeming social importance and unquestionably obscene. Had there been any error in instruction, it would have been harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>(Chapman </em>v. <em>California </em>(1967) 386 U.S. 18 [17 L.Ed.2d 705, 87 S.Ct. 824. 24 A.L.R.3d 10651.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1101-5\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b1101-6\">Appellants\u2019 third major contention is that \u201cPenal Code Section 311.2 as construed and applied to authorize the judgments of conviction herein upon the basis of statewide rather than national community standards violates the free speech, due process, and equal protection provisions of the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution, and the parallel California state constitutional guarantees.\u201d This contention is based upon the court\u2019s instruction to the jury that for the purposes of determining contemporary community standards, the relevant community is the State of California.</p>\n<p id=\"b1101-7\">Respondent is correct that <em>In re Giannini </em>(1968) 69 Cal.2d 563 [72 Cal.Rptr. 655, 446 P.2d 535] is dispositive of thh issue. There, in. considering the contemporary standards test of judging obcenity under the statute here in question, the court expressly designated, the State of California, although two members of that court disagreed and would even authorize the smaller, local, community rather than the entire state. The caveat as to <em>Giannini </em>reflected in <em>Barrows </em>v. <em>Municipal Court </em>(1970) 1 Cal.3d 821 [83 Cal.Rptr. 819. 464 P.2d 483] is not pertinent, because it deals with the vagrancy statute, Penal Code section 647. While <em>Giannini </em>was a prosecution for \u201ctopless\u201d dancing, the court's discussion of the relevant \u201ccommunity\u201d was in express consideration of the definition of \u201cobscene\u201d in Penal Code section 311, subdivision (a), the very statute here involved. Our Supreme Court expressly considered and evaluated the United States Supreme Court cases on obscenity, including <em>Jacobellis </em>v. <em>Ohio </em>(1964) 378 U.S. 184 [12 L.Ed.2d 793, 84 S.Ct. 1676]. After first pointing out that the United States Supreme Court was evenly split on whether a \u201cnational community\u201d is required in determining whether a work is obscene, and then observing that in the absence of guidance from that court the lower courts have divided so as to support at least three <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"Supp. 36\">*Supp. 36</page-number>standards: national, state, and \u201clocal\u201d or citywide (69 Cal.2d at p. 578), <em>Giannini </em>then resolves the matter, for the reasons therein expressed, in favor of a statewide standard. The caveat (69 Cal.2d 579) that the case did not involve films or books simply recognized that such items would require reconciliation of the practical problems of producing evidence of a national standard with the possibility of some claimed deference of expression. The reasons persuading the court to a statewide standard in <em>Giannini </em>have full application here. Further, the United States Supreme Court did in <em>Roth </em>cite with approval the trial court\u2019s instruction which clearly suggested only a local and not even statewide standard.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Additionally, it can be suggested that there is no real \u201cdilemma\u201d in applying a statewide \u201ccommunity\u201d standard to the \u201cnational\u201d protection of the First Amendment. The test itself, \u201cthe average person applying contemporary community standards\u201d <em>(Roth </em>v. <em>United States, </em>supra) applies throughout the nation, but that nation is made up of varying communities which may well entertain varying views.</p>\n<p id=\"b1102-4\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b1102-5\">Appellants fourth contention is that \u201cPenal Code Section 311.2 as construed and applied to authorize the judgments of conviction for sale of the book \u2018Love Together\u2019 without proof that the appellants had knowledge of the contents or the alleged obscenity of the book and upon the giving of instructions and the refusal to instruct as requested by appellants with respect to the element of scienter, violates the free speech, due process, and equal protection provisions of the First and Fourteenth. Amendments to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"Supp. 37\">*Supp. 37</page-number>the United States Constitution and the parallel state constitutional guarantees.\u201d While the appellants did each testify that they had never read the particular book \u201cLove Together\u201d and they did not believe or have reason to believe that the book was obscene, and while scienter is an element of the offense and must be proven by the People, <em>Smith </em>v. <em>California </em>(1959) 361 U.S. 147 [4 L.Ed.2d 205, 80 S.Ct. 215], as the United States Supreme Court did itself observe in <em>Smith, </em>\u201cThe circumstances may warrant the inference that he was aware of what a book contained, despite his denial\u201d (361 U.S. at p. 154 [4 L.Ed.2d at p. 212].) The circumstances shown by the evidence in this case, that the appellants were owner-proprietors and not absentee owners, whose stores were clearly denominated and advertised as \u201cadult\u201d book stores, and who admitted that they dealt in adult books concerned primarly or exclusively with sex, is sufficient to sustain the conviction. The trial court correctly instructed that the knowledge which appellants must have could be established by circumstantial evidence. That it was so established to the jury is demonstrated by their verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b1103-4\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b1103-5\">Appellants fifth and final contention is that \u201cPenal Code Section 311.2 and Penal Code Section 1523-1542 as construed and applied to authorize the judgment of conviction herein based upon the seizure of films pursuant to a general and overbroad warrant and without a prior adversary hearing violates the free speech, search and seizure, due process, and equal protection provisions of the First, Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution and the parallel state constitutional guarantees.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1103-6\">The two films constituting the basis of appellant Adler\u2019s conviction of the offense of possession for sale were seized pursuant to a search warrant which directed the seizure of \u201cnumerous films, both moving and still, portraying obscenity.\u201d It is this allegedly \u201coverbroad\u201d language in using merely the word \u201cobscenity\u201d which appellants attack. Respondent correctly points out that the procedures leading to the issuance of the warrant and surrounding its execution were more than adequate to avoid suppression of constitutionally protected publications. A municipal court judge viewed the two films which had been purchased from the appellant Adler, at which time he had taken them from the trunk of his car, which at that time was seen to contain other films similar in size and markings, at least one of which such other films had been described by the appellant at that time as depicting two women \u201ceating each other.\u201d After the seizure, the appellant did have, and indeed did pursue, by way of suppression motion under 1538.5 of the Penal Code, the opportunity and remedy by which to litigate, in timely fashion, the issue of obscenity, thereby satisfying the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"Supp. 38\">*Supp. 38</page-number>requirements of due process of law. <em>(Aday </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1961) 55 Cal.2d 789 [13 Cal.Rptr. 415, 362 P.2d 47]; <em>Monica Theater </em>v. <em>Municipal Court </em>(1970) 9 Cal.App.3d 1 [88 Cal.Rptr. 71].) The prior adversary hearing advocated by appellant has been expressly rejected in <em>Monica, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1104-4\">The judgments therefore must be affirmed. No contrary result is compelled by either <em>People v. Noroff </em>(1967) 67 Cal.2d 791 [63 Cal.Rptr. 575, 433 P.2d 479] or <em>Redrup </em>v. <em>New York </em>(1967) 386 U.S. 767 [18 L.Ed.2d 515, 87 S.Ct 1414].</p>\n<p id=\"b1104-5\">All that was involved in <em>Noroff, supra, </em>was a nudist magazine which, while displaying the naked male or female including genitalia, did not depict sexual activity of any form. As to this, the United States Supreme Court: \u201c. . . . has decided that the judiciary cannot engage in the task of placing legal fig leaves upon variegated presentations of the. human figure. That court has told us that no matter how ugly or repulsive the presentation, we are <em>not to hold nudity, absent a sexual activity, to be obscene.\u201d </em>(67 Cal.2d at p. 797, italics added.) <em>Noroff </em>further concluded that the dominant theme of that magazine taken as a whole, did not appeal to a prurient interest in sex. The \u201cpandering\u201d discussion was rejected because it was advanced for the first time on appeal, whereas the originial charge in the indictment had been the obscenity <em>per se </em>of the magazine. The sexual activity absent in <em>Noroff </em>is present in the instant appeals; indeed, the representations of the nude human forms herein are in nothing <em>but </em>a sexual context. The dominant theme of the materials herein, taken as a whole, appeal <em>only </em>to a prurient interest in sex, and have no redeeming social value.</p>\n<p id=\"b1104-6\"><em>Redrup </em>v. <em>New York, supra </em>is simply of no value, in this or any other current obscenity proceeding. The very diversity of the rules recited therein prevents that opinion from standing for any clearly definable principle of obscenity law. To synthesize <em>Redrup </em>into the whole by en-grafting the requisite of pandering onto the law of obscenity requires an almost labyrinthine process of implication and construction, since the Supreme Court has never said that in express terms. This (pandering) is too consequential a limitation upon the law of obscenity to be assumed without specific declaration. Certainly the fountainhead of the current law, <em>Roth </em>v. <em>United States, supra, </em>never contained that limitation, and none of the subsequent reaffirmations of <em>Roth, </em>through <em>Stanley </em>v. <em>Georgia </em>and <em>Reidel </em>and <em>Thirty-Seven Photographs, supra, </em>have announced the addition of the element of pandering to the conduct criminally actionable as obscenity. It can further be suggested that <em>Reidel </em>and <em>Thirty-Seven Photographs </em>have \u201creturned\u201d judicial thinking to the original path of <em>Roth, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"Supp. 39\">*Supp. 39</page-number>and whatever straying therefrom may have been engendered by <em>Redrup, Stanley </em>v. <em>Georgia </em>and <em>Karalexis </em>v. <em>Byrne, supra, </em>is now corrected. Whatever <em>Redrup </em>may have been intended to announce or exemplify, it should not authorize the construction of a new wall of limitation (pandering) upon obscenity law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1105-5\">The judgments are affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1095-8\">At the time here involved, Penal Code section 311, subdivision (a), provided: \u201c \u2018Obscene\u2019 means that to the average person, applying contemporary standards, the predominant appeal of the matter, taken as a whole, is to a prurient interest, i.e., a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"Supp. 30\">*Supp. 30</page-number>shameful or morbid interest in nudity, sex, or excretion, which goes substantially beyond customary limits of candor in description or representation of such matters; and is matter which is utterly without redeeming social importance.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1102-6\">\u201c \u2018. . .

I am unable to read into <em>Redrup </em>a requirement that a statute proscribing the commercial distribution of pornographic material as the same is defined in <em>Roth </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1957) 354 U.S. 476 [1 L.Ed.2d 1498, 77 S.Ct. 1304] cannot be valid unless it is directed toward the protection of juveniles or unwilling audiences or expressly prohibits \u201cpandering\u201d in the distribution of the material. It is true that <em>Redrup </em>recites the absence of such claims by the prosecution and also the absence of \u201cpandering\u201d as that term is used in <em>Ginzburg </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1966) 383 U.S. 463 [16 L.Ed.2d 31, 86 S.Ct. 942] 'but it does not follow that the conviction of <em>Redrup </em>was reversed because of the absence of such elements.</p>\n<p id=\"b1105-7\">Whether or not <em>Redrup </em>has been misconstrued or misapplied in later cases, the Supreme Court of California has taken the view that the Supreme Court of the United States has now drawn the line between constitutionally non-repressible pornography and constitutionally repressible pornography at a point which permits private use and assimilation of pornographic material, no matter what, and a point which forbids commercial distribution and dissemination of pornographic material which meets the <em>Roth </em>test. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Luros </em>(1971) 4 Cal.3d 84 [92 Cal.Rptr. 833, 480 P.2d 633], referring to <em>Stanley </em>v. <em>Georgia </em>(1969) 394 U.S. 557 [22 L.Ed.2d 542, 89 S.Ct. 1243].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1105-8\">The last paragraph of the majority opinion in <em>People </em>v. <em>Luros, supra </em>at page 93 of 4 Cal.3d, reads as follows: \u201cTherefore we find that <em>Stanley, </em>as the United States Supreme Court expressly stated, does not impair <em>Roth </em>and the cases following it. States retain broad power to regulate obscenity and regulation of the public distribution of obscenity falls well within the broad scope of that power. <em>Stanley </em>does not require that an indictment charging public distribution of obscenity also charge that the obscene <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"Supp. 40\">*Supp. 40</page-number>matter was distributed to a child or unwilling audiences. We conclude that <em>Stanley </em>has no application to<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> [this] case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1106-3\">Mr. Justice Tobriner in his dissent in <em>Luros </em>mentioned the \u201cspecial circumstances\u201d referred to in <em>Redrup </em>so we may assume that the majority which decided <em>Luros </em>was conversant with all of the arguments which disturb our dissenting colleague in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1106-4\">Six weeks after the decision of <em>Luros </em>by the Supreme Court of California, the Supreme Court of the United States decided <em>United States </em>v. <em>Reidel </em>(May 3, 1971) 402 U.S. 351 [28 L.Ed.2d 813, 91 S.Ct. 1410] and in that decision arrived at the conclusion that the restriction of sales to adults only and to willing purchasers did not require a holding that the material could not constitutionally be suppressed as hardcore pornography assuming it met the <em>Roth </em>test. This should lay the ghost of <em>Redrup </em>to rest, and attacks upon the California statute should be addressed to the Legislature rather than the courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b1106-5\">At the time of the trial of the case on appeal, section 311 of the Penal Code defined various words used in chapter 7.5 which includes section 311.2. The defendants were charged either with \u201cdistributing obscene matter\u201d or \u201cpossessing with intent to distribute\u201d under the same section. It was established that the \u201cdistributions\u201d involved or intended were sales.</p>\n<p id=\"b1106-6\">Section 311, subdivision (a) defined \u201cobscene matter\u201d as set forth by Judge Goldberg in his dissent, but section 311, subdivision (d) defined the word \u201cdistribute\u201d as follows: \u201c(d) \u2018Distribute\u2019 means to transfer possession of, whether with or without consideration.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1106-7\"><em>People </em>v. <em>Noroff, </em>67 Cal.2d 791 [63 Cal.Rptr. 575, 433 P.2d 479], did not hold that \u201cpandering\u201d had to be established before material could be held to be repressible pornography. It merely held that in the case before the court the material could not qualify, under the decision in <em>Roth, supra, </em>as repressible pornography and that since there was no evidence of \u201cpandering\u201d which might permit a holding that the material was repressible, in spite of its innocuous character, it could not be repressed. Under the test set forth in <em>Roth, </em>it was therefore not repressible pornography, hoi the case before this court the material is repressible under the <em>Roth </em>test and it is completely irrelevant whether \u201cpandering\u201d is present or not present. The only thing necessary is \u201cdistribution\u201d or \u201cintent to distribute\u201d and in this case since the distribution was \u201ccommercial\u201d we need not concern ourselves about what we would be called upon to decide if the material here had not been sold by the defendants or held by them for sale. In other words, the statute with which we are dealing is valid as to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"Supp. 41\">*Supp. 41</page-number>the defendants in this case under the circumstances with which we are here involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b1107-5\">This principle of appellate review is set forth in a dissenting opinion by Mr. Justice Frankfurter in <em>Staub </em>v. <em>Baxley </em>(1958) 355 U.S. 313, 330-331 [2 L.Ed.2d 302, 316, 78 S.Ct. 277] as follows: \u201cEven though its action may result in the disadvantages and embarrassments of keeping open doubtful questions of constitutionality, this Court will consider only those very limited aspects of a statute that alone may affect the rights of a particular litigant before the Court. ... A statute may be found invalid in some of its parts but valid in others ... it may be valid at one time and not another ... it may be valid under one state of facts but not another ... it may be valid as to one class of persons and invalid as to others, ... It is because the exercise of the right to declare a law unconstitutional is \u2018the most important and delicate duty of this Court,\u2019 and because that right \u2018is not given to [the Court] ... as a body with revisory power over the action of Congress,\u2019 . . . nor, it may be added, over the action of the forty-eight States, that this Court has from the beginning demanded of litigants that they show in precisely what way and to what extent incursions have been made into their federally protected rights and rules have been developed designed to narrow as closely as possible the issues presented by such claims.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1107-6\">I am therefore convinced that section 311.2 was valid as to the defendants in this case in; that their conduct or intention with reference to the material in question was \u201cdistribution\u201d of a commercial character. That is all that was required.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1107-10\">I dissent somewhat more vigorously on two other propositions. The one is on the publication of these opinions. I do not believe that they meet the criteria for publication in California Rules of Court, rule 976. They do not establish a new rule or modify an existing rule. They do not criticize or even involve existing law, because the applicable statute has long since been amended significantly. And, I feel, they do not involve matters of public interest such as are described in footnote 2 to rule 976. The \u201cconstitutional jungle\u201d cannot be reclaimed by this court With <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"Supp. 42\">*Supp. 42</page-number>three reviewing courts over us, we can do no more than go over old ground and contribute to rather than relieve the existing difficulties. I view these opinions only as aids to our own analysis and, hopefully, as guides to the parties. They are not and cannot be definitive, and so they should not be intruded on the profession by publication. The other proposition from which I dissent is the refusal of my brethren to certify the case to the Court of Appeal on our own motion pursuant to rule 63(a). If the case is important enough to require publication, it is important enough to be certified, rule 62(a), even though transfer of the case would remove these opinions from the Official Reports under rule 976(d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b1107-7\">GOLDBERG, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A4h\">I dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b1107-8\">Justice Friedman recently wrote: \u201cJudicial disagreements in obscenity cases should be characterized by extreme deference, because obscenity law is a constitutional jungle.\u201d <em>Glancy </em>v. <em>County of Sacramento</em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark><em> </em>(Cal.

The complaints against Rose were filed on October 18, 1967, October 20, 1967, and June 7, 1968, Nos. 263660, 263687 and 3325M, respectively. The one against Rose was filed on June 10, 1968, No. 3372M. The trial began on December 26, 1968, and the verdicts were returned on January 29, 1969. (On another complaint against Adler, No. 3326M, the court directed a verdict of not guilty; and another complaint against Rose, 3373M, was dismissed by the prosecution.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1108-4\">Two of Adler\u2019s convictions were based on the sale of obscene motion pictures. The third Adler conviction and the Rose conviction were based on the sale of an obscene book, \u201cLove Together.\u201d This book and these films bring to mind Justice Stewart\u2019s reference to \u201chard-core pornography\u201d in <em>Jacobetlis </em>v. <em>Ohio </em>(1964) 378 U.S. 184, 197 [12 L.Ed.2d 793, 803-804, 84 S.Ct. 1676]: \u201cI shall not . . . attempt further to define the kinds of material I understand to be embraced within that shorthand description; and perhaps I could never succeed in intelligibly doing so.

But the expression \u201chard-core pornography\u201d is as elusive as \u201cobscenity.\u201d <em>(Jacobellis </em>v. <em>Ohio, supra, </em>378 U.S. at p. 201 [12 L.Ed.2d at pp. 805-806], Warren, C. J., dissenting.) For example, the New York Court of Appeals adopted it in <em>People </em>v. <em>Richmond County News, Inc. </em>(1961) 9 N.Y.2d 578 [216 N.Y.S.2d 369, 175 N.E.2d 681, 685], apparently applied it to sustain another conviction, and was reversed in <em>Mishkin </em>v. <em>New York </em>(1966) 383 U.S. 502 [16 L.Ed.2d 56, 86 S.Ct. 958] (Kuh, Foolish Figleaves? (1967) 58, 78.) And in <em>United States </em>v. <em>West Coast News Company </em>(6th Cir. 1966) 357 F.2d 855, 858, the court reviewed a collection of trash similar to that confronting us and upheld the conviction saying: \u201cWe know hard-core pornography when we see it.\u201d In one of its three-line per curiam opinions that became commonplace in obscenity cases, the Supreme Court said simply, \u201creversed. <em>(Redrup </em>v. <em>New York, </em>386 U.S. 767 (1967),\u201d (1967) 388 U.S. 447 [18 L.Ed.2d 1309, 87 S.Ct. 2095].) It may be that \u201chard-core pornography\u201d is no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"Supp. 43\">*Supp. 43</page-number>more than a \u201cpersonal obscenity divining rod.\u201d (Kuh, <em>supra, </em>at pp. 63-64.) Nevertheless, I assume that the present materials fit the description, because if they do not, nothing does.</p>\n<p id=\"b1109-5\">The fact that the materials distributed are hard-core pornography is not alone enough to sustain a conviction. As <em>Redrup, supra, </em>has been applied by the Supreme Court, before a conviction may be sustained there must be not only the distribution of obscene material but distribution under circumstances involving either (a) juveniles, or (b) obtrusion on an unwilling audience, or (c) pandering. The first two of these alternatives are not shown by the evidence before us. The last was irrelevant under Penal Code section 311.2 at the time of the offenses involved here. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Noroff </em>(1967) 67 Cal.2d 791, 793 [63 Cal.Rptr. 575, 433 P.2d 479].) Since one of the three alternatives is required and none are available, the convictions must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1109-6\">At the risk of being charged with supererogation, I shall try to explain this in a. little detail: In 1967, Penal Code section 311.2 provided: \u201cEvery person who knowingly: Sends or causes to be sent, or brings, or causes to be brought, into this state for sale or distribution, or in this state prepares, publishes, prints, exhibits, distributes, or offers to distribute, or has in his possession with intent to distribute or to exhibit or offer to distribute, any obscene matter is guilty of a misdemeanor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1109-7\">\u201cObscene\u201d was then defined by Penal Code section 311 as follows: \u201c(a) \u2018Obscene\u2019 means that to the average person, applying contemporary standards, the predominant appeal of the matter, taken as a whole, is to prurient interest, i.e., a shameful or morbid interest in nudity, sex, or excretion, which goes substantially beyond customary limits of candor in description or representation of such matters and is matter which is utterly without redeeming social importance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1109-8\">In 1967, sections 331 and 311.2 said nothing about the mode of distribution, but in 1969, section 311 was recast and amended to provide in part in new subparagraph (a): \u201c(2) In prosecutions under this chapter, where circumstances of production, presentation, sale, dissemination, distribution, or publicity indicate that matter is being commercially exploited by the defendant for the sake of its prurient appeal, such evidence is probative with respect to the nature of the matter and can justify the conclusion that the matter is utterly without redeeming social importance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1109-9\">This amendment is apparently based on <em>Ginzburg </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1966) 383 U.S. 463 [16 L.Ed.2d 31, 86 S.Ct. 942], discussed <em>infra, </em>and seems designed to alter the law as stated in <em>People </em>v. <em>Noroff, supra, </em>particularly footnote 4 at page 793. The sufficiency, of the amendment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"Supp. 44\">*Supp. 44</page-number>to preserve more recent prosecutions from <em>Redrup </em>reversals is, of course, not involved here, and I neither express nor intimate any opinion on that problem. But accepting the amendment at its face value as a rule of evidence, rather than as an element of the crime, it has no application here, because the trial here was begun and concluded long before the amendment was adopted. At the time of the trial what was important under sections 311 and 311.2 was the fact of distribution; the circumstances of distribution were irrelevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b1110-4\">Section 311 emanated from <em>Roth </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1957) 354 U.S. 476 [1 L.Ed.2d 1498, 77 S.Ct. 1304], which defined obscenity as: \u201c[W]hether to the average person, applying contemporary community standards, the dominant theme of the material taken as a whole appeals to prurient interest[,]\u201d <em>id. </em>at page 489 [1 L.Ed.2d at page 1509], and said: \u201c[b]ut implicit in the history of the First Amendment is the rejection of obscenity as utterly without redeeming social importance^\u201d <em>id. </em>at pages 484-485 [1 L.Ed.2d at page 1507]. Section 311 also anticipated the similar language in <em>Memoirs </em>v. <em>Massachusetts </em>(1966) 383 U.S. 413, 418 [16 L.Ed.2d 1, 5-6, 86 S.Ct. 975]. <em>In re Giannini </em>(1968) 69 Cal.2d 563, 573 [72 Cal.Rptr. 655, 446 P.2d 535].</p>\n<p id=\"b1110-5\"><em>Ginzburg </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1966) 383 U.S. 463 [16 L.Ed.2d 31, 86 S.Ct. 942], decided the same day as <em>Memoirs, </em>affirmed a federal conviction for mailing obscene material. The court assumed, but did not hold, that the materials could not themselves be adjudged obscene in the abstract. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 474 [16 L.Ed.2d at p. 40].) Instead it looked to the defendants\u2019 conduct in disseminating the materials; e.g., efforts to mail them from, the hamlets of Intercourse and Blue Ball, Pennsylvania, and finally mailing them from Middlesex, New Jersey, <em>id. </em>at pages 467-468 [16 L.Ed.2d at pages 36-37]; the. \u201cleer of the sensualist\u201d permeating the advertising, <em>id. </em>at page 468 [16 L.Ed.2d at page 37]; and the purveyors\u2019 sole emphasis on the sexually provocative aspects of the publications, which \u201cfact may be decisive in the determination of obscenity.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 470 [16 L.Ed. 2d at p. 38].) In a nutshell <em>Ginzburg </em>held that in determining obscenity one need not look only at the materials but may also look to \u201cthe setting in which the publications were presented as an aid . . . .\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p; 465 [16 L.Ed.2d at p. 35].) It did not hold that one was obliged to look to that setting, although it does say: \u201cIt is important to- stress that this analysis simply elaborates the test by which the obscenity <em>vel non </em>of the material must be judged.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 475 [16 L.Ed.2d at p. 41].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1110-6\">Discussions since <em>Ginzburg </em>frequently refer to \u201cpandering\u201d because of the reference in the opinion to \u201cthe sordid business of pandering\u2014\u2018the business of purveying textual or graphic matter openly advertised to appeal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"Supp. 45\">*Supp. 45</page-number>to the erotic interest of . . . customers.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 467 [16 L.Ed.2d at p. 36].) Since, and perhaps because of, <em>Stanley </em>v. <em>Georgia </em>(1969) 394 U.S. 557, 564, 567 [22 L.Ed.2d 542, 549, 550-551, 89 S.Ct. 1243], the more recent cases refer to \u201ccommercial distribution\" or \u201cpublic distribution.\u201d But the citation of <em>Redrup, </em>in <em>Stanley, id. </em>at page 567 [22 L.Ed.2d at pages 550-551], shows that \u201cpandering\u201d is still with us. Further, in the present context \u201cpandering\u201d and \u201ccommercial distribution\u201d seem to be synonymous.</p>\n<p id=\"b1111-5\"><em>Redrup </em>v. <em>New York </em>(1967) 386 U.S. 767 [18 L.Ed.2d 515, 87 S.Ct. 1414], a per curiam opinion, reversed three state obscenity convictions, because \u201cWhichever of these constitutional views [of the members of the Supreme Court] is brought to bear upon the cases before us, it is clear that the judgments cannot stand.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 771 [18 L.Ed.2d at p. 518].) The materials were not described, but the court pointedly noted that the cases did not involve the states\u2019 concern for juveniles, or prevention of obtrusive assaults on individuals unwilling to be exposed to dubious materials, and that \u201cin none was there evidence of the sort of \u2018pandering\u2019 which the court found significant in <em>Ginzburg </em>v. <em>United States, . . </em>.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 769 [18 L.Ed.2d at p. 517].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1111-6\"><em>Redrup </em>is so cryptic that in itself it defies analysis and but for its frequent iteration by the court would be useless as a precedent. The penetrating and comprehensive text published shortly after its announcement gives it but passing mention. (Kuh, Foolish Figleaves? (1967) 52, fn. 2, 121, fn. 6, 230, fn. 23.) It has been virtually ignored in the learned periodicals. But the one article on the case says: <em>\u201cRedrup </em>may be the most important obscenity decision since the 1957 landmark of <em>Roth </em>v. <em>United States. </em>... As of March, 1969, <em>Redrup </em>had been cited as controlling or as a key factor in the reversal of 35 state and federal obscenity convictions.\u201d (Teeter and Pember, <em>The Retreat from Obscenity: Redrup </em>v. <em>New York (1969) 21 </em>Hastings L.J. 175-176. See also <em>State </em>v. <em>Hoyt </em>(1970) 286 Minn. 92 [174 N.W.2d 700, 702, 711] (dissenting opinion); \u201creversed, <em>Redrup </em>v. <em>New York </em>. . . .\u201d <em>Hoyt </em>v. <em>Minnesota </em>(1970) 399 U.S. 524 [26 L.Ed.2d 782, 90 S.Ct. 2241].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1111-7\">\u201cBy their fruits ye shall know them,\u201d is an admonition that is particularly applicable to <em>Redrup </em>in its California context. <em>Schackman </em>v. <em>Arnebergh </em>(C.D.Cal. 1966) 258 F.Supp. 983, appeal dismissed for lack of jurisdiction (1967) 387 U.S. 427 [18 L.Ed.2d 865, 87 S.Ct. 1622], rehearing denied (1967) 389 U.S. 893 [19 L.Ed.2d 204, 88 S.Ct. 16], was an unsuccessful effort to enjoin a pending prosecution under Penal Code section 311.2. The district court reviewed the evidence, motion pictures of naked women masturbating, in all its sordid details. One of these films, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"Supp. 46\">*Supp. 46</page-number>D-15, was displayed to this court as an exemplar in Vengetechalliam v. Municipal Court,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> No. 194889, and it was, assuming the term has some meaning, \u201chard-core pornography.\u201d Nevertheless, when the conviction was finally reviewed by the Supreme Court on the merits, it was \u201creversed. <em>Redrup </em>v. <em>New </em>York, . . <em>Schackman </em>v. <em>California </em>(1967) 388 U.S. 454 [18 L.Ed.2d 1316, 87 S.Ct. 2107]. (On the connection between the two <em>Schackman </em>cases see <em>Hermann </em>v. <em>United States </em>(D.C.App. 1969) 259 A.2d347, 348.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1112-3\">On the same day that <em>Schackman </em>was reversed, the court affirmed <em>Landau </em>v. <em>Fording </em>(1966) 245 Cal.App.2d 820 [54 Cal.Rptr. 177]. (388 U.S. at p. 456 [18 L.Ed.2d 1317, 87 S.Ct. 2109.) <em>Landau </em>involved a motion picture of men masturbating. Of course, it is inconceivable that the cases turned on some sort of \u2022 distinction between auto eroticism in men and women. The difference between <em>Schackman </em>and <em>Landau </em>is that in <em>Schackman </em>pandering was not discussed although the films were shown in a peep-hole machine in an arcade; but in <em>Landau </em>the court found not only that the film was commercially exploited but also that the case met \u201cthe criteria recently set forth in <em>Ginzburg </em>v. <em>United States, </em>. . .\u201d (245 Cal.App.2d at p. 830.) In <em>Schackman </em>only three justices would have affirmed on the basis of <em>Ginzburg.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1112-4\">What has apparently happened, therefore, is that what was permitted in <em>Ginzburg </em>has become a requirement under <em>Redrup. </em>If we assume that to sustain an obscenity conviction not only must the material meet the tests of content laid down in <em>Roth </em>and <em>Memoirs, </em>but also that the conduct of the disseminator must show one of the three elements of distribution stated in <em>Redrup, </em>then the different results in <em>Schackman </em>and <em>Landau </em>become comprehensible. Justice Otis dissenting in <em>State </em>v. <em>Hoyt, supra, </em>174 N.W.2d at page 711, took this position, and he seems to have been correct. The injection of these elements reflects the application of the concept that has been called \u201cvariable obscenity,\u201d under which the same given materials may under some circumstances be made the basis of a prosecution and under other circumstances may not. This concept originated in <em>Ginzburg </em>(Kuh, Foolish Figleaves? (1967) at p. 76) and has since been expressly adopted <em>(Ginsburg </em>v. <em>New York </em>(1968) 390 U.S. 629, 635-636 and <em>id. </em>fn. 4 [20 L.Ed.2d 195, 201-202, 88 S.Ct. 1274]).</p>\n<p id=\"b1112-5\">The above analysis conforms to the results in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Reidel </em>(1971) 402 U.S. 351 [28 L.Ed.2d 813, 91 S.Ct. 1410] and <em>United States </em>v. <em>Thirty-Seven Photographs </em>(1971) 402 U.S. 363 [28 L.Ed.2d 822, 91 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"Supp. 47\">*Supp. 47</page-number>S.Ct. 1400], decided on the third of May and involving materials intended for commercial distribution. Mere private possession of obscene materials has not been made a crime under the California statutes <em>(In re Klor </em>(1966) 64 Cal.2d 816 [51 Cal.Rptr. 903, 415 P.2d 791]), nor could it be <em>(Stanley </em>v. <em>Georgia </em>(1969) 394 U.S. 557 [22 L.Ed.2d 542, 89 S.Ct 1243]). .But it does not follow that there is \u201ca constitutional right in people like Reidel to distribute or sell obscene material.\u201d <em>(United States </em>v. <em>Reidel, supra, </em>402 U.S. at p. 356 [28 L.Ed.2d at p. 817].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1113-5\">Reidel was charged with violating the same statute as Ginzburg, i.e., using the mails for the delivery of obscene matter. Compare 383 U.S. at page 464, footnote 2 [16 L.Ed.2d at pages 34-35] and 402 U.S. at page 352 [28 L.Ed.2d at page 815, footnote 1], He procured the dismissal of the indictment on the basis of <em>Stanley, </em>and the Supreme Court reversed. The court assumed the materials were obscene. (402 U.S. at p. 353 [28 L.Ed.2d at p. 816].) The circumstances of the distribution were, of course, not developed at this stage of the proceedings, but there is enough to suggest, at least, that what <em>Landau </em>v. <em>Fording </em>calls the <em>Ginzburg </em>criteria would be met. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 353, fn. 3 [28 L.Ed.2d at p, 816].) The viability of those criteria is illustrated in the separate concurrence of Justice Marshall: \u201csuch mail order distribution poses the danger that obscenity will be sent to children.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 361 [28 L.Ed.2d at p. 821].) <em>Reidel </em>is essentially similar to <em>People </em>v. <em>Luros </em>(1971) 4 Cal.3d 84 [92 Cal.Rptr. 833, 480 P.2d 633] (proof of probable cause sufficient to indict).</p>\n<p id=\"b1113-6\"><em>United States </em>v. <em>Thirty-Seven Photographs </em>apparently involves the same alleged pornographer involved in <em>People </em>v. <em>Luros, supra. Luros </em>sought to import the photographs. He stipulated that some or all of them \u201cwere intended to be incorporated in a hard cover edition of The Kama Sutra of Vatsyayana, a widely distributed book candidly describing a large number of sexual positions.\u201d (402 U.S. at p. 366 [28 L.Ed.2d at p. 828].) The court held, on the basis of <em>Reidel, </em>that they might be subject to forfeiture under the customs laws. Since the attack was solely on the constitutionality of the statute, it was not necessary to decide, nor did the court decide, that the photographs were obscene.</p>\n<p id=\"b1113-7\">The court agreed on a judgment, but only four members concurred in Justice White\u2019s opinion that importation of obscenity intended solely for the private use of the importer might be forbidden. Justices Black and Douglas again dissented on the grounds that \u201cthe First Amendment denies Congress the power to act as censor . . . .\u201d (402 U.S. at p. 379 [28 L.Ed.2d at p. 836].) Justice Stewart dissented on the basis of <em>Stanley </em>v. <em>Georgia. (Id. </em>at p. 379 [28 L.Ed.2d. at p. 835].) Justice Marshall dissented on the ground that the proceeding was premature: \u201c[T]he Government has ample opportunity to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"Supp. 48\">*Supp. 48</page-number>protect its valid interests if and when commercial distribution should take place.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 361 [28 L.Ed.2d at p. 820].) And Justice Harlan concurred in the judgment because <em>Luros </em>had \u201cstipulated that the materials were imported for commercial purposes,\u201d and, therefore, had no standing to raise the overbreadth of the statute as applied to materials for private use. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 377-378 [28 L.Ed.2d at p. 835].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1114-4\">Thus, as in the progeny of <em>Redrup </em>v. <em>New York, Reidel </em>and <em>Thirty-Seven Photographs </em>appear to depend not merely on the obscenity of the materials but on the element of commercial distribution or, in <em>Ginzburg </em>terms, pandering. It should be noted that in both of his cases <em>Luros </em>apparently sought to minimize the pandering element by relying on arguments mentioning only the elements of distribution to minors or intrusion on the sensibilities of unwilling adults. (Cf. 4 Cal.3d at p. 90 and 402 U.S. at p. 375 [28 L.Ed.2d at p. 833]. But cf. <em>Stanley </em>v. <em>Georgia </em>(1969) 394 U.S. 557, 567 [22 L.Ed.2d 542, 550-551, 89 S.Ct. 1243].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1114-5\">There is ample evidence of pandering in the instant case, e.g., the \u201cadult\u201d bookstore and the advertising blurbs on the covers of \u201cLove Together\u201d: <em>\u201cNot </em>one word cut from this fiery tale of sexual excess in which perversion was the order of the day and normal sexuality something weird, square and almost unknown!\u201d \u201cArtists and models writhe together in frantic abandon in a world where anything goes.\u201d (Kuh, <em>supra, </em>at pp. 76, 78.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1114-6\">But the evidence of pandering cannot be used to sustain the convictions here, because of <em>People </em>v. <em>Noroff </em>(1967) 67 Cal.2d 791 [63 Cal.Rptr. 575, 433 P.2d 479], decided a few months after <em>Landau </em>was affirmed. There it was held that evidence of pandering did not sustain a prosecution under section 311.2. The section did not refer to pandering. \u201cInsofar as dictum in <em>Landau </em>v. <em>Fording . . . </em>suggests a contrary reading of the California statutes, it is hereby disapproved.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 793.) \u201cNothing in <em>Klor [In re Klor </em>(1966) 64 Cal.2d 816 (51 Cal.Rptr. 903, 415 P.2d 791)], of course, suggested the adoption of a \u2018pandering\u2019 concept similar to that elaborated in <em>Ginzburg </em>in the context of the federal obscenity statute.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>fn. 4.) Since the California Supreme Court declined to include in the version of section 311.2 that is before us an alternative element that the United States Supreme Court indicates must be present if the other alternatives are not present, and they are not present, the convictions must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1114-7\">Under <em>Noroff </em>former section 311.2 is overbroad, because it applies to any distribution and is not limited to pandering or commercial distribu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"Supp. 49\">*Supp. 49</page-number>tion, or, in the language of <em>Dombrowski </em>v. <em>Pfister </em>(1965) 380 U.S. 47,9, 491, 492, 502 [14 L.Ed.2d 22, 31-32, 37, 85 S.Ct. 1116], \u201chard-core conduct.\u201d This court cannot, because of <em>Noroff, </em>salvage the statute by giving it an acceptable narrowing construction limiting it to \u201cthe sort of \u2018hard-core\u2019 conduct that would obviously be prohibited under any construction.\u201d <em>(Dombrowski </em>v. <em>Pfister, supra.) </em>The interpretative technique suggested in <em>Dombrowski </em>was employed in <em>In re Cox </em>(1970) 3 Cal.3d 205, 223, 224 [90 Cal.Rptr. 24, 474 P.2d 992], and in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Thirty-Seven Photographs, supra, </em>402 U.S. at page 375 [28 L.Ed.2d at page 833, footnote 3]. But <em>Noroff </em>makes it unavailable to- us here.</p>\n<p id=\"b1115-5\">The reason the problem posed by <em>Noroff </em>has not been highlighted before this may be that since <em>Redrup </em>there has, apparently, been no reported decision sustaining a conviction under former Penal Code section 311.2 other than <em>People </em>v. <em>Pinkus </em>(1967) 256 Cal.App.2d Supp. 941 [63 Cal.Rptr. 680]. <em>Pinkus </em>was overruled <em>sub silentio </em>by <em>In re Giannini </em>(1968) 69 Cal.2d 563 [72 Cal.Rptr. 655, 446 P.2d 535]. <em>Monica Theater </em>v. <em>Municipal Court </em>(1970) 9 Cal.App.3d 1, 21 [88 Cal.Rptr. 71] (dissenting opinion). Recently, however, a minority of the Advisory Board to the Joint Legislative Committee for Revision of the Penal Code have questioned the validity of a proposed statute which would make \u201ctrafficking in obscenity\u201d a crime. This minority includes the District Attorney of Sacramento County. They said: \u201cThe language of the [proposed] section is not limited to commercial transactions or exhibitions and one might be guilty of such a crime if he shows such obscene material to a friend or friends within,the confines of his own home. This comes very close to the mere possession situation discussed in <em>Stanley </em>v. Georgia.\u201d Joint Legislative Committee for Revision of the Penal Code, The Criminal Code (1971) Penal Code Revision Project Staff Draft, page 212. And the problems posed by limited circulation are discussed in <em>The Supreme Court, 1970 Term </em>(1971) 85 Harvard Law Review 3, 229, 235-237.</p>\n<p id=\"b1115-6\">Another reason that the convictions should be reversed is that the jury was instructed: \u201cfor the purposes of determining the obscenity of the matter here in question, the relevant community is the entire State of California.\u201d This instruction was obviously derived from <em>In re Giannini </em>(1968) 69 Cal.2d 563 [72 Cal.Rptr. 655, 446 P.2d 535], Although there is no reference to any community in section 311, <em>Giannini </em>held that \u201cthe words \u2018customary limits of candor,\u2019 as used in section 311 of the Penal Code . . . require a showing that the material so exceeds customary limits of candor as to affront contemporary community standards of decency.\u201d (I<em>d. </em>at p. 574.) It then held that the contemporary community standards must be established by evidence, and that \u201cFor the purposes of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"Supp. 50\">*Supp. 50</page-number>determining the obscenity of the performed dance here in question, the relevant \u2018community\u2019 is the entire State of California.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 577.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1116-4\"><em>Giannini </em>was a prosecution for \u201ctopless dancing,\u201d i.e., indecent exposure and: lewd conduct in public. Penal Code sections 314, subd. 2 and 647, subdivision (a). It was not a prosecution under section 311.2. Section 311, defining obscenity, was relevant only as an analogy for determining the meaning of the terms \u201clewd\u201d and \u201cdissolute\u201d in sections 314 and 647, subdivision (a). <em>(Id. </em>at p. 567.) The court carefully pointed out that \u201cthe decision to stage a \u2018topless dance\u2019 rests solely on local considerations . . .,\u201d but that when dealing with books and films, as in the instant case, different considerations are present. \u201cEvaluation of \u2018speech\u2019 that is designed for nationwide dissemination, such as books or films, according to a non-national community standard might well unduly deter expression in the first instance and thus run afoul of First Amendment guarantees. But we need not, in the instant case, reconcile this contention with the practical problems of producing evidence of national standards.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 579.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1116-5\">In the case at hand we must make the reconciliation, because here we are involved with books and films. The reasoning of Justices Brennan and Goldberg in <em>Jacobellis </em>v. <em>Ohio </em>(1964) 378 U.S. 184 [12 L.Ed.2d 793, 84 S.Ct. 1676] is compelling: \u201cWe do not see how any \u2018local\u2019 definitions of the \u2018community\u2019 could properly be employed in delineating the area of expression that is protected by the Federal Constitution. . . . [A] standard based on a particular local community would have \u2018the intolerable consequence of denying some sections of the country access to material, there deemed acceptable, which in others might be considered offensive to prevailing community standards of decency.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 193 [12 L.Ed.2d at p. 801].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1116-6\">This view should prevail as long as the Supreme Court adheres to the opinion that \u201cThe freedoms protected against federal encroachment by the First Amendment are entitled under the Fourteenth Amendment to the same protection from infringement by the States.\u201d <em>(United Mine Workers </em>v. <em>Illinois </em>(1967) 389 U.S. 217, 221, fn. 4 [19 L.Ed.2d 426, 430, 88 S.Ct. 353].) Justice Harlan\u2019s opinion that there is a difference between the powers of the states and the United States, and that the Fourteenth Amendment confines the states \u201conly insofar as such power is inconsistent with our concepts of \u2018ordered liberty\u2019 \u201d <em>Roth </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1957) 354 U.S. 476, 501 [1 L.Ed.2d 1498, 1516, 77 S.Ct. 1304], has not prevailed.
