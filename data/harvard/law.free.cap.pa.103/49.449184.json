A married woman has no power to bind herself by a bond for borrowed money. Thai, the money was borrowed for and applied to the improvement of her separate real estate, is immaterial.

A., a married woman, executed with her husband a conveyance of certain land whereof she was seised, to B. Two days afterwards, B. executed articles of agreement, whereby it was agreed that B. should advance 03,000, to be used in erecting a mill on the land, and that he should reconvey the land to A., on payment of said sum. Several months aficrwards A. and her husband executed a bond and mortgage of the land to I?. for 05,737.28, which sum had been borrowed from him. Both these instruments recited the former transactions and the intent of the parties to consider them as a mortgage. Attached to the bond ivas an agreement by B. that if there should be a sale under the mortgage, and B should receive all the money arising therefrom, he would release A. and her husband from all liability upon the bond. B. afterwards entered up judgment on the bond by virtue of the warrant, of attorney therein contained, issued execution on said judgment, and levied on the lot of ground in question. At the sheriff's sale, IS. bought, in the lot, and exchanged receipts with the sheriff for the purchase money. ,B. subsequently issued a scire facias upon the mortgage accompanying the bond, to which the defendants filed an affidavit of defence, setting out the foregoing facts:</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b65-7\"><em>Held, </em>that the bond of A., a married woman, being void, the sale under the judgment obtained thereon was without force or effect, and did not avail to divest her title, and that therefore the foregoing facts eon\u201e stituted no defence to the scire facias sur mortgage.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b65-8\">3.

J., tiling the following opinion :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b69-12\">\u201c Where a conveyance is made to a married woman, and she and her husband give a bond and mortgage to secure the payment of the purchase money, such bond and mortgage are valid against the wife as to the land so convoyed ; and if judgment is entered on the bond by virtue of a confession contained in it, a sheriff\u2019s sale on such judgment transfers her title to the purchaser. This is a well settled rule of law in Pennsylvania: Shnyder <em>v. </em>Noble, 13 Norris 286. In this ease it was said \u201ca bond secured by mortgage is part of tbe mortgage, and must be regarded as one or more of the conditions of that instrument put, for the sake of convenience and more ready enforcement, into the shape of a bond.\u201d It was true this was said in a case of purchase money for land \u2014 the only ease in which a married woman can bind herself by bond \u2014 but where she borrows money <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>to improve her own estate, or to secure money loaned to her husband, or for the payment of his debts, her bond and mortgage are valid, and they form one instrument or obligation as much as if given for purchase money, and I am unable to see why her confession or judgment in the bond is not equally valid. A judgment entered upon it would be a lien only on the land described in the mortgage \u2014 that is, no other land belonging to her, would be bound by it, and a sale, made under such judgment, would convey all the interest that a sale would, on the mortgage, for the reason that \u201cthe bond secured by the mortgage is a part of the mortgage,\u201d and if suit could be maintained on the bond, I see no want of power\u2019, on her part, to give a valid warrant of attorney; and as Judge <em>Gordon </em>said, in the caso already referred to, \u201cwe cannot understand why such conditions may not be enforced as well when contained in the bond as when written in the mortgage itself.\u201d The mortgage was given to better secure the payment of the bond, and the power to confess jndgment was no greater exercise of power than to obligate herself to pay money. I have been of this opinion for years, and although some doubt has been raised by the individual expression of opinion by some of the judges of the Supreme Court, I do not understand that court to have decided different from what is here indicated, and I think their ruling in the distribution of the fund, raised by the sale mentioned in the affidavit of - defence. is a substantial determination of the validity of the sale on.the jndgment entered against Wells and wife on the bond, secured by the mortgage in this suit. At least, it is my opinion that such sale vested in Gr. H. Tandyke, all the title that Wells and wife had in the land, and'hence this proceeding on the mortgage is unnecessary.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b70-5\">\u201c Rule discharged.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b70-6\">The plaintiff thereupon took this writ of error, assigning for error the order of the court discharging said rule for judgment for want of a sufficient affidavit of defence.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b70-7\">\u2022 <em>John F. Sanderson </em>(with him <em>Edward Overton, Jr.), </em>for the plaintiff in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AJ\">\u2014 This proceeding upon the mortgage originated from the defendants making claim to the property, they alleging the sale on the bond to be void, and is for the purpose of quieting the title by a sale upon the mortgage, or by a decision of this court that the sale under the judgment is valid. The question is whether the voluntary confession of judgment by a married woman contained in the -joint bond of herself and husband, which accompanies her mortgage of her real estate, for-borrowed money, duly executed, is valid, as' against the mortgaged premises, so as to sustain a sheriff\u2019s sale <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>upon execution issued upon such judgment. The agreement of Mr. Vandyke to release the bond upon a sale of the mortgaged premises upon the mortgage, will not of course be held to discharge the debt, if the sale upon the bond was not a valid sale. If the sale upon the bond was valid, it is conceded that no judgment can be rendered for the plaintiff. No decision of this court has been found which rules this case. The judgment upon the bond cannot be sustained merely because the confession of judgment is the joint confession of husband and wife. Such confession is of no validity as to the wife : Shallcross <em>v. </em>Smith, 31 P. F. Smith 132; Keiper <em>v. </em>Helfricker, 6 Wright 325. Nor can it be sustained merely because the married woman might be compelled by resort to an appropriate remedy to pay the debt: Keiper <em>v. </em>Helfricker, 6 Wright 325. A judgment in a personal action can be obtained against a married woman only for necessaries contracted for by herself, or in some of the cases enumerated in the Act of Assembly, and ,thc facts to fix her liability must affirmatively appear on tile record, otherwise the judgment is void: Huguss <em>v. </em>Dithridge Glass Co., 15 Norris 160; Hecker <em>v. </em>Haak, <em>7 </em>Norris 238; Steinman <em>v. </em>Henderson, 13 Norris 313; Schriffer <em>v. </em>Saum, 31 P. F. Smith 385. It is said in the following cases that a married woman\u2019s confession of judgment is void except in the single case of a debt for purchase-money of laud, and then valid only as against the land purchased : Brunner\u2019s Appeal, 11 Wright 67; Quinn\u2019s Appeal, 5 Norris 447; Shnyder v. Noble, 13 Norris 286; Glass <em>v. </em>Warwick, 4 Wright 140. The cases settling the liability in the present instance are Patterson <em>v. </em>Robinson, 1 Casey 81; Ramborger <em>v. </em>Ingraham, 2 Wright 146. In the first ease the ruliug is put upon the principle, that as a married woman has power to purchase, her application to deprive the creditor of hissecurity for the purchase-money, could not be granted as to the lands purchased. In the second case it was put upon the ground that the conveyance and the lien for the unpaid purchase-money, are one transaction, and both benefit and burden must be treated as valid. Other, grounds on which these cases are based have been denied, and Judge Strong, in Brunner\u2019s Appeal, 11 Wright 67, after criticising these cases, said: \u201cIt matters not whence comes her power to bind land which she lias purchased by confessing a judgment. It is enough that it is settled that slie has power to confess a judgr ment in this one case.\u201d In Schlosser\u2019s Appeal, 8 P. F. Smith 493, Judge Sharswood said : \u201c The cases which permit a married woman to bind her separate property, are exceptions to a general rule of sound policy, and ought to be strictly confined, within the limits prescribed. If we begin to reason on the abstract justice of making her property answerable for her honest debts, the exceptions will soon eat out the rule-itself!\u201d \u2019</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b72-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>The recent decisions of this court upon the powers and liabilities of married women indicate a conservative tendency, and display keen discrimination in sustaining the just powers of married women, without extending them in opposition to the general policy. They show that the disposition of this court is to look at the substance of the transaction and to further the remedy where the power or liability is unquestionable : Rose <em>v. </em>Latshaw, 9 Norris 238; Brown\u2019s Appeal, 13 Norris 362; Dando\u2019s Appeal, 13 Norris 76; Fryer <em>v. </em>Rishell, 3 Norris 521; Daubert <em>v. </em>Eckert, 13 Norris 255; Steinman <em>v. </em>Henderson, <em>13 </em>Norris 313.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b72-6\">The principle upon which the validity of the judgment on the bond in this case may be sustained, may be stated as follows : The bond and mortgage arise out of one transaction, evidence one contract, and constitute substantially one instrument. The confession of judgment is in furtherance of the remedy for <em>the </em>collection of the mortgage, is in recognition of a liability which the law has imposed in the creation of the pledge which has been made in the exercise of an undoubted legal right, and has the effect to enable the'Creditor to accomplish amicably and with little expense the same result which otherwise must be reached by adverse and- more expensive process. At the same time, no advantage has been gained to the prejudice of the woman\u2019s right for the judgment by confession'is at all times subject to the control of the court.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b72-7\">A distinction must be taken between stipulations in a mortgage which are contractual and those which are remedial merely. A married woman c\u00e1nnot contract under the form of a mortgage so as to bind herself in matters with <em>reference to </em>wjiich she is incapable of contracting, so as to subject herself to forbidden liabilities : Wolbach <em>v. </em>Build\u2019g Asso., 3 Norris 211. A bond and mortgage constitutes one instrument. Shnyder <em>v. </em>Noble, 13 Norris 286. A married woman may stipulate in a mortgage that, on failure to pay the interest annually,\u2018the principal may be enforced : Glass <em>v. </em>Warwick, 4 Wright 140. She may stipulate for the issue of a scire facias thereon immediately on default: Black <em>v. </em>Galway, 12 Harris 18. She may convey her land by agent authorized by a power of attorney duly executed and acknowledged : Fulweiler <em>v. </em>Baugher, 15 S. <em>&amp; </em>R. 45. And may, with her husband, enter into an amicable confession of judgment of revival by scire facias : Brunner\u2019s Appeal, 11 Wright 67; McCullough <em>v. </em>Wilson, 9 Harris 436. The reasoning upon which these cases are based is that what the married woman may do directly, she may do indirectly: that power to convey includes the power to convey upon condition, and power to convey upon condition implies power to prescribe the terms; that the creation of a power of sale in an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>agent or creditor, which is permitted, implies a right to vest the same authority in officers of the law, through legal forms, and that she should be permitted to do that voluntarily in furtherance of remedy, which she is legally bound to submit to, and which creates no new liability.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b73-6\">Judgment in this case against the defendant should be for the mortgage debt, with interest, without abatement by reason of the bid made by the purchaser at sheriff\u2019s sale upon the bond. The defendants cannot be permitted to redeem the land without payment of the full amount of the mortgage debt: Evans <em>v. </em>Meylert, 7 Harris 402.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b73-8\"><em>R. A. llerour </em>and <em>II. N. Williams {E. J. </em>Angle, -with them), for the defendants in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Aph\">\u2014 -The plaintiff in error, indifferent as to whether the judgment is affirmed or reversed, seeks to have an abstract question of law decided, in advance, on a rule for judgment for want of a sufficient affidavit of defence, and has presented arguments and authorities on both sides of the question. The only question now is, was the case, as presented in the affidavit of defence, a proper one to be sent\u00f3 a jury. The position of Amelia Wells at each stage of the transaction must be regarded. Prior to July 2d 1873, she could clearly have avoided her agreement of September 1872. But the only consideration for the mortgage, of July 3d 1873, was a past consideration, and a married woman cannot enlarge her contractual powers by mortgage (except for purchase money of real estate), so as to subject herself to forbidden liabilities: Wolbach <em>v. </em>Building Ass'n, 3 Nor. 214; Schlosser\u2019s Appeal, 8 P. F. S. 493.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"AD7\">April 9th 1883.</decisiondate>\n<opinion data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b73-9\">Mr. Justice Gbeen</author>\n<p id=\"AY\">delivered the opinion of the court,</p>\n<p id=\"b73-10\">In this case a judgment was entered on abend and warrant, against a married woman. The real estate of the wife was sold upon execution on this judgment, and purchased by the plaintiff in the judgment. Subsequently a scire facias was issued against the wife and her husband, on the mortgage, which was given with the bond to secure its payment. Against this scire facias the defendants interpose an affidavit of defence alleging that the bond and mortgage were given to secure the payment of $5,757.28 borrowed by the defendants from the mortgagee, that the money was loaned upon a bond accompanying the mortgage and bearing the same date, a copy' of the bond being annexed, that it contained a clause authorizing the entry of judgment, upon which judgment was entered, execution issued and the land described in the mortgage was sold to the mortgagee for $4,000, the said sum being received by the mortgagee <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>\u25a0less the expenses of sale. The affidavit further alleged that the mortgagee by an agreement attached to the bond and signed by him, agreed that in the event of a sale of the premises upon \u25a0the mortgage, and of the mortgagee\u2019s receiving all of the money arising from the sale, he would release the payers of the bond from the further payment of any sum remaining due upon the bond ; that the mortgagee did receive the full proceeds of the sale and therefore the bond and mortgage became extinguished and void.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-4\">So far as the effect of this annexed agreement is concerned we do not see how it can operate as a defence to this action, for the reason that it was only to become effective in the event of a sale <em>upon the mortgage. </em>There has never been a sale upon the mortgage, and hence, literally, the agreement to release has no operation. Of course if a sale upon the judgment entered on the bond had the same legal effect in divesting the title of the mortgagors as a sale upon the mortgage, it could be argued with great, and possibly with controlling force, that the remander of the debt was extinguished by force of the provision for a release. But we are very clearly of opinion that the sale under the judgment had no such effect. It was a judgment against a married woman and her husband. It was good enough against the husband but it had no validity, against the wife,, and the title to the land was in the wife. The title was somewhat curiously complicated by the fact that the wife and her husband had made a deed for the ground \u2014 about a quarter of an acre of land in the country \u2014 to the mortgagee, who in turn executed and delivered an agreement to the grantors, by which he undertook to reconvoy the promises to them, upon their paying to him certain advances to the extent of $3,000 which he agreed to make, for the building of a mill upon the land. It was agreed between the parties that these papers should constitute a mortgage, and in the following year a mortgage was actually executed by Wells and wife to Vandyke, treating the title as in the wife. It was upon this mortgage t.he present writ of scire facias was issued. The transaction therefore was, what the parties agreed in writing and under seal it should be, a bond and mortgage to secure the payment of a loan of money to the wife. On this bond the judgment was entered, on which execution was issued and the premises sold as set out-in the affidavit of defence.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-5\">That such a judgment, as against a married woman is absolutely void, lias been s\u00f3 frequently decided, and upon such sufficient reasons, that a prolonged discussion of the subject is entirely unnecessary. The circumstance that the money borrowed was obtained for the improvement of the land of Mrs. Wells is of no consequence. It was, nevertheless, a loan of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>money for which the bond was given, and that fact avoids it without any regard to the use to which the money was put. Thus in Keiper <em>v. </em>Helfricker, 6 Wr. 325, it was held that where a married woman gave a judgment bond to one who advanced her money, to be applied, at the time, for the purchase of real estate by her, for her sole and separate use, and which was in fact so applied, the bond so given was void and could not be enforced against lier separate estate. Head, J., on p. 329 said, \u201c The bond and warrant of attorney being those of a married woman, were absolutely void, and, of course, the judgment upon the bond was a nullity as against her.\u201d He further said that the bond, warrant and judgment \u201cwould not be good even though given for debts contracted before marriage, or for necessaries for the support and maintenance of her family.\u201d This was directly held in the case of Glyde <em>v. </em>Keister, 8 Cas. 85, and in Caldwell <em>v. </em>Walters, 6 Harr. 79, it was held that not only was the bond and warrant void as to the wife, but that a sale of her real estate upon the judgment entered on the bond, and the purchase of it during coverture by the plaintiff in the judgment, did not divest her title. These eases have never been departed from. The ease of a bond given by a married woman directly for the payment of purchase money of real estate conveyed to her as a part of the same transaction, is the one exceptional case, in which the instrument is treated as valid and made effective against the land sold, but no further: Patterson <em>v. </em>Robinson, 1 Cas. 81; Ramborger <em>v. </em>Ingraham, 2 Wright 146. The reasoning of those eases is perfectly familiar to the profession, and it is unnecessary to repeat it here. In Brunner\u2019s Appeal, 11 Wright 67, we held that a judgment given by a mairied woman for a debt contracted for the improvement of her real estate is void. Strong, J., on p. 73, said that the judgment bond given by a married woman for the purchase money of real estate was the single exception to the rule of invalidity, admitted in this state : and on p. 75 he said that had the land of the wife in that case been sold upon the judgment no title would have passed. Our brother Tbunkey, in delivering the opinion of this court in Hecker <em>v. </em>Haak, 7 Norris on p. 242, said, \u201c She cannot give a valid warrant of attorney to confess judgment, even for a debt contracted by herself for necessaries used by herself and family. A judgment on such warrant, though in legal contemplation the judgment of the court, is a nonentity. The only exception is where the warrant and judgment are for purchase money of real estate conveyed to her, which may be enforced against the land itself, but not against her other lands or goods.\u201d lie also held that a sale of the wife\u2019s land upon a void judgment was a nullity and passed no title. In Quinn\u2019s Appeal, 5 Norr. 447, Woodward, J., said on p. 452, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>\u201c A judgment confessed by a married woman can be enforced in the single instance where, when a conveyance is made to her, it forms part of an-agreement under which she takes land subject to the condition that she shall pay its price.\u201d The case of Shnyder <em>v. </em>Noble, 13 Norr. 286, upon which the learned judge of the court below ruled this case for the defendants, is no exception to the rule. There the bond was given directly for purchase money of land conveyed to the wife. There was also a mortgage to secure the bond, and both instruments were executed by the husband and wife. It is true the action was debt on the bond, and it was held that the circumstance that there was no warrant of attorney, and confession of judgment, did not affect the case. It was the bond, or rather the contracting power to make the bond, that gave validity to the warrant, and not the power to make the warrant that gave validity to the bond. Judge Gordon said what had been so often said before, that the bond \u201cstill would remain a bond for purchase money, the single and only case in which a married woman has power to execute such an instrument.\u201d Whether the peculiar conditions of the transaction were incorporated in the bond or in the mortgage made no difference, since botli were given for the same purpose. In no respect was this case intended to chango the existing law. It remains as before. Entertaining these views, we are of opinion that the learned judge of the court below was in error in refusing judgment under the rule for that purpose, and the case must, therefore, be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-5\">Order discharging rule reversed and procedendo awarded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
