Upon oiie occasion, when delivering goods to a customer, he abused Sutton. \u2022 The latter, hearing of this, charged Anderson with-having done so, and, upon his admitting it, discharged him. Immediately thereafter Anderson went to a customer of Sutton\u2019s and exhibited samples of Sntton\u2019s coffee and told him \u201c that Sutton &amp; Co. delivered inferior goods to what they sold. I meant that Sutton <em>&amp; </em>Co. were swindling and cheating their customers. I took them (the sampl\u00e9s) the day before. Sutton did not tell me to take them. He did not know I had them ; he did not tell me to go to Richardson and show those samples or use them in any way. I returned to Sutton &amp; Co.\u2019s after a pair of shoes, about 4 o\u2019clock in the afternoon. Mr. Sutton asked me where I got those samples of coffee. I told him I got them up stairs. I delivered him those two samples. After I delivered up the samples Mr. Sutton charged me with theft, and sent for an officer. It was for stealing those particular samples that I was arrested.\u201d The plaintiff was arrested about 5 o\u2019clock in the afternoon, and was held in $500 bail on a charge of larceny. He remained all night in a cell at the Central station. The next day <em>before the </em>hearing, plaintiff \u201c made an agreement with Mr. Yansant, Sutton\u2019s partner, that I would not interfere any more with their customers.\u201d At the hearing, Sutton not appearing, the defendant was discharged. He then brought this suit.</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b168-6\">At the close of the plaintiff\u2019s case the defendant moved for a non-suit, which was refused. He then submitted testimony, and subsequently presented the following point: \u2014 \u201c Under all the evidence, if believed by you, there was probable cause for the arrest of Mr. Anderson, your verdict must therefore be <em>for </em>the defendant.\u201d Refused. Exception. (First assignment of error.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b168-7\">The court, in'the charge, said, inter alia:</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b168-8\">[By Mr. Anderson\u2019s testimony it appears, and he states, that he had a right to the possession of the samples which he had at the time ; that in addition to his duties as a porter in the store, he took samples and sold-goods at night; that at least upon one occasion Mr. Sutton had given him samples, wrapping them up and marking the prices upon them ; that he liad these samples in his possession if not by direct authority of Mr. Sutton, at least by his implied'authority;] that when after he had left Mr. Sutton\u2019s employ, and after he had been in Mr. Richardson\u2019s store and returned to Mr. Sutton\u2019s store for the purpose of obtaining his shoes he was asked in relation to these samples, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>lie says that lie at once stated that lie had them in his possession \u2014 that they were samples that he had taken for the purpose of selling goods \u2014 and that he at once delivered them to Mr. Sutton. [Now if this is all \u2014 if this is just what took place at that time \u2014 the truth and the whole, truth \u2014 a fair inference from it is that although Mr. Anderson the moment he left Mr. Sutton\u2019s employ should have returned the samples; that they were taken without any intent on liis part to appropriate them to his own use ; and that there was no probable cause for his arrest based upon that state of facts.] (Fourth assignment of error.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b169-6\">Verdict for plaintiff for $250, reduced by remittitur, on rule for a new trial, to $125, and judgment thereon.

The plaintiff himself testified that he was employed by Sutton &amp; Co. at six dollars per week, that he was a porter, and that he did nothing but manual labor. He said he had never sold a dollar\u2019s worth of goods for Sutton <em>&amp; </em>Co. while lie was with them, that he once had samples which Sutton had given him on his own request stating that he would try and sell some to a friend. These samples were put up by Sutton, who delivered them personally to the plaintiff, and marked the prices on them. He further testifies that immediately after he was discharged he went to Richardson, who was a customer of Sutton &amp; Co., that he had samples in his pocket which he showed to Richardson and told him that Sutton &amp; Co. delivered inferior goods to those they sold, and that he meant that Sutton <em>&amp; </em>Co. were swindling and cheating their customers. He admits that he had taken the samples from Suttou &amp; Co.\u2019s store from a lot of coffee that had just come in ; that Sutton did not tell him to take the samples, and that no person saw him take them. He further says that Sutton did not know that ho (Anderson) had the samples, and that he did not tell him to show them to Richardson or use them in any way. He says also that he wrapped the samples in paper when he took them, put them in his pocket, kept them there <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>until he returned them to Sntton on the evening of the day he was discharged, and that it was for stealing these particular samples he was arrested. He also testifies that when he returned in the afternoon to Sutton &amp; Co.\u2019s store for a pair of shoes, Sutton asked him where he got the samples of coffee from, and he replied ho got them up stairs and thereupon Sutton charged him with theft, and sent for an officer. Charles Miller, a witness produced and examiued by the plaintiff, said he was present in the afternoon when Anderson returned to the store, and heard the conversation between him and Sutton and repeated it, as follows : \u201c Mr. Sutton said, What have you been doing to-day? What did yon go to Richardson\u2019s for? Where are those samples you showed him ? And where are those-samples that you stole from up-stairs ? Anderson first said, I have no samples. Mr. Sutton then said, Yes, you have, Richardson was here and told me all about it. Then Anderson said, Yes, I have the samples. Mr. Sutton then demanded the samples and-received them from Anderson.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b170-5\">, It is not easy to conceive how a stronger case of probable cause than this could be made out. The person who took the missing goods from the owner admits that he took them without the knowledge, authority or consent\" of the owner, that ho took them secretly, that he used them for a purpose of revenge, that he kept them till he ivas charged with their theft, and his witness proves that when first asked for them he denied having them, but subsequently admitted having them and delivered them to the owner. All the elements essential to prove larceny are present in this testimony ; the unlawful taking by one, of the property of another, without the knowdedge or consent of the latter, and the conversion of the property taken to the use of the taker. To make the matter worse the taker admits that he used the property for his own private and personal pnrpose of revenge ag\u00e1inst the owner. The facts as proved by the plaintiff and his witness are far stronger than were the facts in the case of Bernar <em>v. </em>Dunlap, 13 Norr. 329, in which we sustained a compulsory non-suit. There the prosecutor was simply informed .by the word of a third person that he had seen the prosecutor\u2019s gauntlets -in possession of the plaintiff, while here the plaintiff liimself not only admits that he took the goods and took them secretly, but produced them from his pocket and delivered them to the prosecutor on demand of the latter, who immediately charged him with the theft and sent for an officer to arrest him.\" Miller, the plaintiffs\u2019 witness, testified that Sutton charged the plaintiff with the theft in the first instance and that Anderson at first denied having them, but after being told that Richardson had told Sutton all about it, admitted that lie had them and delivered them to Sutton</p>\n<p id=\"b171-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>Anderson\u2019s allegation on the witness stand that he took the samples the day before he was discharged does not help his case in the least, as he does not say that he told that to Sutton, and he does net pretend that he had a general authority to take samples for any purpose. Ilis statement that he took the samples to sell goods by is emphatically disproved by his own testimony that he used them with a customer of the house for the very purpose of preventing sales. It is not at all necessary to recur to Sutton\u2019s testimony to make out a case of probable cause. The burden of proving want of probable cause rested upon Anderson, and he must also prove malice: Kirkpatrick <em>v. </em>Kirkpatrick, 3 Wr. 288; Dietz <em>v. </em>Langfitt, 13 P. F. S. 234; Bernar <em>v. </em>Dunlap, 13 Norr. 329. The .burden of proving probable cause was not shifted to the defendant in this case because the plaintiff established it by his own testimony, and when this is the case it is the clear duty of the court to so instruct the jury. This we held in both the cases of Dietz <em>v. </em>Langfitt and Bernar <em>v. </em>Dunlap, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-6\">We think the learned judge was in error in the matter covered by the fourth assignment. It is certain that Anderson did not testify that he had a right to the possession of the samples, or that in addition to his duties as porter he took samples and sold goods at night. The statement of the learned judge to that effect would tend to mislead the jury and was hence erroneous. Nor do we think there was any conflicting testimony as to any material facts of the case. Upon the testimony of the plaintiff and his witness it is quite clear to us that probable cause for the prosecution Was fully established. The abandonment of the prosecution was entirely explained by the testimony of Vansant, who said that Anderson promised he would go about his business and never mention the name of Sutton again, for reference or for any other purpose, if he, the witness, Would induce Sutton not to carry on the prosecution, and that he did induce Sutton to take this course. The assignments of error are all sustained except the second and sixth.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-7\">Judgment reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
