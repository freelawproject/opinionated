Certain land was conveyed by A. to B., and while it was in the latter\u2019s name, several judgments were entered against him. Subsequently a bill in equity was filed by C. \u2014 B.\u2019s wife \u2014 against A. and B., in which B. \u2019s judgment creditors were not joined, setting forth a prior contract by A. to convey to C., alleging that the deed to B. was fraudulent, and praying that it be cancelled and the property conveyed to 0., which under a decree of the court was done. C. after mortgaging the property, conveyed it to D., and it was subsequently sold under said mortgage, and a feigned issue was awarded to determine whether the fund produced should go to C.\u2019s mortgage creditors and grantee, or to B.\u2019s judgment creditors. The plaintiffs, claimants under 0., having shown their claim through her, the defendants offered in evidence the cancelled deed to B., which was rejected on the ground that it had been destroyed as a deed by the cancellation. <em>Held, </em>to be error, because tile defendants, not having been joined in the equity proceedings, were entitled to their day in court upon the feigned issue.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b17-10\">2.

W. Dewitt and George Henning, mortgage creditors of Harriet E. Yorscheimer, and B. W..Lewis, her grantee, .or Wm. M. Platt, Charles Rittispaugh, The Wyoming National Bank and George Henning, who were judgment creditors of Emil Yorscheimer, Harriet E. Yorscheimer\u2019s husband, were entitled to the proceeds of certain real estate, sold by the sheriff, under a mortgage thereon, given in 1878 by Harriet E. Yorschiemer to George Henning.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b18-6\">The plaintiffs in the issue were Dewitt, Henning and Lewis. The facts, which are more fully set out in the opinion of this court, were briefly as follows. The plaintiffs alleged that in 1859 or 1860, Dewitt, in whom the title to the land in question was then conceded to be, contracted to sell the same to Mrs. Yorscheimer, but that in 1872 Emil Yorscheimer induced Dewitt to destroy this agreement, and deed the land to him, and while the title was thus in him, between the years 1872 and 1878, the defendants obtained their judgments against him, which were duly revived. That when Mrs. Yorscheimer discovered'the conveyance of 1872, she brought a bill in equity against Dewitt and her husband, in which bill the defendants were not joined and after a reference to a Master, procured a decree that the deed be cancelled and declared void as to her, and that Dewitt be required to convey to her. Whereupon, July 27th 1878, Dewitt made a deed to her, in pursuance of the original agreement, and she in turn made a purchase money mortgage to Dewitt, and on November 28th 1878, a mortgage to Henning. In January 1880, she sold and conveyed the prop-to Lewis.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"pAAV\">Henning subsequently issued a sci. fa. on his mortgage, and the fund in controversy was realized by the sheriff\u2019s sale in pursuance of this proceeding.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b18-9\">In order to rebut the prima facie case thus shown by plaintiffs, the defendants offered in evidence the deed of September 19th 1S72, from Dewitt to Emil Yorscheimer, together with evidence that Henning, Lewis-and Mrs. Yorscheimer all had notice of this deed before the deed of 1878 to Mrs. Yorscheimer, and before she executed the mortgages on the premises. This was objected to, inter alia, on the ground that by virtue of the decree ordering the cancellation of the deed, it had ceased to exist as such, and the objection was sustained. The defendants then offered the answer of Dewitt in the equity proceeding, proof of a contract in 1862 by Dewitt with Emil Yorscheimer, upon which several hundred dollars were paid, and in pursuance of which the deed of 1872 was made to Yorscheimer, and a judgment given by him to Dewitt for the balance of the purchase money; evidence of a declaration by Yor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>scheimer, in the presence of his wife, that he owned the land ; evidence of a conversation with Henning in regard to Vorscheimer\u2019s ownership ; proof that the defendants lent their money, relying on the declarations of the plaintiffs themselves, in regard to the title to the property, and that Lewis bought with full knowledge of the deed of 1872.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b19-6\">Upon objection, these offers of evidence were all rejected by the court, to which rulings, exceptions were taken, and they were assigned for error in the first seven specifications.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b19-7\">The court instructed the jury, inter alia, as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b19-8\">\u201cThere is no evidence in this case that Emil Vorscheimer had any title to this land. The evidence there is in the case is that Emil Vorscheimer got money of Mr. liittispaugh (perhaps by alleging to him falsely that ho owned the land), and that judgments were entered against him. But there being no evidence whatever in the case that Emil Vorscheimer had any title to this land, and the whole evidence showing that his wife owned it, of course the mortgage creditors of the wife are entitled to the money that is derived from the sale. So that there is no question as to what should be the result of this issue.

The plaintiffs in the issue were M. W. Hewitt and George Henning, mortgagees, and B. W. Lewis, terre-tenant of the land thus sold; and the defendants therein were the present plaintiff in error and other judgment creditors of Emil Yorscheimer, whose judgments antedated the mortgages.</p>\n<p id=\"b20-9\">It was contended by the plaintiffs below that by the deed of Dewitt and wife, executed in July 1878, the title to the land sold by the sheriff became vested in Mrs. Yorscheimer, and hence her mortgagees should be first paid out of the proceeds, and the residue should be awarded to Lewis, her subsequent vendee. On the other hand, the contention of the plaintiff in error and other defendants below was that, at the date of their respective judgments against Emil .Yorscheimer, he,.and not his wife, was the owner of the land in question, and consequently their liens took precedence of the mortgages subsequently executed by Yorscheimer and wife to Dewitt and Henning, and should be first paid out of the fund, in the order of their respective dates.</p>\n<p id=\"b20-10\">For the purpose of maintaining the issue on their part, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>plaintiffs, after showing title in Dewitt in 1860, gave in evidence his deed of July 27th 1878, to Mrs. Yorscheimer, the mortgages of July 27th and November 19th 1878, to Dewitt and \u00edlenning respectively, the deed of January 1880 to Lewis, the record of the scire facias on the Henning mortgage, judgment thereon, execution and sale by the sheriff, from which the fund for distribution was realized. To rebut the prima facie case thus presented, the defendants below mallo the several offers of evidence, contained in the first seven specifications of error, for the purpose of proving, inter alia, that the land in question was conveyed in September 1872 by Dewitt and wife to Emil Yorscheimer, their judgment debtor, and that the consideration of one of the judgments held by plaintiff in error was purchase money, and the other was money loaned on the faith of the title thus acquired and held by Emil Yorscheimer. The judgment last referred to was entered in 1873, and the lien thereof was regularly continued by scire facias and judgment thereon in 1878. It is conceded that in 1872, prior to the entry of the original judgment, the property in question was conveyed by Dewitt to Emil Yorscheimer; hut in 1878 a hill in equity was filed by Mrs. Yorscheimer against her husband and his vendor, Dewitt, alleging that the equitable title to the land was in her, and praying, inter alia, that the deed to her husband be cancelled and declared void as to her, and that Dewitt he required to convey or cause to be conveyed to her the whole or such portion of the premises as might be adjudged to belong to her. Notwithstanding the rights of the plaintiff in error and other judgment creditors might be affected by the decree prayed for, they were not made parties to the proceeding. Perhaps, if they had been, the defence might have been more vigorous and the result somewhat different. In his answer, Emil Yorscheimer substantially admitted all the material allegations of the bill, and, in the most accommodating spirit, assented to any decree the court might see fit to make. The case was so proceeded in that a decree was made, declaring the deed of 1872 from Dewitt to Emil Vorscheimer void, and directing its cancellation, and ordering Dewitt to execute and deliver to Mrs. Yorscheimer a deed, in fee simple, for the premises in dispute. When the defendants below offered the deed of 1872, to Emil Yorscheimer, to he followed by other evidence, for the purpose of showing title, in their debtor, which was bound by the lien of their judgments, and that the subsequent mortgagees and vendee took their securities and conveyance, respectively, with knowledge of that title and the liens thereon, they were met by the objection that the deed had been so completely annihilated by the decree that it cannot now he regarded as ever having existed; that the decree is absolutely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>conclusive of the question of title and cannot bo inquired into collaterally. These objections would be unanswerable if defendants below had been parties to the equity proceeding ; but they wore not. As to the questions involved in that proceeding, so far as their personal rights might be affected thereby, they never had a day in court until they were called upon to defend in the feigned issue ; and, hence it follows they were not concluded by the decree. They had aright to prove, by way of defence in the feigned issue, such facts and circumstances as would have been relevant in the equity case, if they had been made parties thereto. As was said by Mr. Justice Thompson, in Morrison <em>v. </em>Mullin, 10 Casey 12 : \u201cIt contravenes the tirst principles of justice to hold a man bound by a judgment, against which ho has. neither an opportunity to defend, nor notice in any way that he was to be involved in its consequences.\u201d The same principle is recognized in Taylor <em>v. </em>Cornelius, 10 P. F. Smith 187; Mackey <em>v. </em>Coates, 20 P. F. Smith 350, and other cases. The general rule that judgments conclude only parties and privies is illustrated in the case\u2019of terre-tenants not made parties to a sci. fa. sur mortgage. They have a right to take the same defence in an after suit that they might have made if they had been warned by service of the scire facias: Mather <em>v. </em>Clark, 1 Watts 491; Schnepf\u2019s Appeal, 11 Wr. 37; Kramph <em>v. </em>Hatz, 2 P. F. Smith 525. But, it is said, the court would have received the testimony if defendants could have visited the plaintiffs in the issue with notice of the prior conveyance to Emil Yorscheimer and the circumstances connected with the judgments represented by plaintiff in error and others. As to the mortgagees, Dewitt and Henning, the testimony offered would have been quite sufficient to have carried that question to the jury; and we think it was also sufficient as to Lewis, the terre-tenant. He served as master in the equity suit, and was therefore fully advised of the conveyance to Emil Yorscheimer several years before. The facts and circumstances, necessarily brought to his notice in that case, were sufficient to put him on inquiry, as to whether the property was conveyed or incumbered by Yorscheimer while the legal title was in him. The proper prosecution of that inquiry, before he took a conveyance from Mrs. Yorscheimer, would have led to a knowledge of the judgments in favor of plaintiff in error and, in all probability, the circumstances under which they were obtained. In that event, it would have' been the duty of the court to submit the case to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b22-5\">Judgment-reversed and a venire facias de novo awarded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
