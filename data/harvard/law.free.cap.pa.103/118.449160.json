Walstrom and Edwin B. Stevens, copartners trading as Walstrom <em>&amp; </em>Stevens, against William Hopkins, senior, and Abraham Bowker, copartners, late trading as Bowker &amp; Hopkins. \u25a0 The defendant. Hopkins alone was served. The suit was originally brought before a magistrate, who gave judgment for the plaintiff against the defendant Hopkins for $51.49. On appeal by the said defendant to the <em>Common </em>Pleas, the plaintiff filed a copy of hook entries for goods sold and delivered and work done, to which the defendant Hopkins filed the following affidavit of defense:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b134-13\">\u201c During July 18.78, the firm of Bowker <em>&amp; </em>Hopkins was dissolved and Abraham Bowker continued the business, agreeing to pay all debts. The usual notice of dissolution was published, but, in .order: that knowledge of dissolution should be brought directly to the firm of Walstrom &amp; Stevens, your deponent, notified them both of said dissolution, and that the debts would be paid by Bowker, according to agreement, and the notice <em>published; </em>Walstrom &amp; Stevens said they were satisfied <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>with Bowker as a debtor; that they liad often done work for him. That they would release your deponent and look to Bowker for the'debt, which he was and now is able to pay. Plaintiffs continued furnishing goods to Bowker after they had received notice of dissolution and no demand of any kind has ever been made on deponent oil account of this debt until this suit was brought.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b135-4\">The plaintiffs entered a rule to show cause why judgment should not be entered for want of a sufficient affidavit of defense, which rule the court, after argument, discharged, whereupon the plaintiffs took this writ of error, assigning for error the order of the court discharging said rule.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b135-5\"><em>JIunn [Monaghan </em>with him), for the plaintiffs in error.\u2014</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AqL\">A plea stating the facts in the affidavit of defence would be demurrable, because no consideration is set forth for the alleged release by the plaintiffs to Ilopkins as a retiring partner. lie had left the firm prior to the alleged promise to release, without affecting his liability to the plaintiffs and the alleged promise was clearly nudum pactum. A promise founded upon an executed consideration is bad : Eastwood <em>v. </em>Kenyon, 11 Ad. &amp; Ell. 451; Lampleigh <em>v. </em>Brathwait, Hob. 239; Hunt <em>v. </em>Bate, 3 Dyer 272a; Child <em>v. </em>Morley, 8 Term 610; Shorb\u2019s Ex\u2019r <em>v. </em>Shultz 7 Wright 208; Miller <em>v. </em>Hemler, 5 W. &amp; S. 486; Partridge <em>v. </em>Partridge, 2 Wright 78; Campbell <em>v. </em>Daly, 25 Leg. Int. 124. The English cases with reference to the release of one partner are to the same effect: Lodge <em>v. </em>Dicas, 3 B. &amp; A. 611; Robinson <em>v. </em>Read, 9 B &amp; C. 449. Thompson v. Percival, 5 B. &amp; Ad. 925, is distinguishable, because there plaintiff accepted a note from onepartner in full satisfaction of his claim against both.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b135-6\"><em>J.

The doctrine adopted in some of the States is that where, upon; the retirement of a partner, the remaining partner undertakes to pay the debts and secure the credits of the firm, the relation of principal and surety is established between him and the retiring partner, and any act of a firm creditor having knowledge of such an agreement as would release a surety, will discharge the retiring partner: Colgrove <em>v. </em>Tallman, 67 N. <em>Y. </em>95; Harris <em>v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>Lindsay, 4 W.

But when all this is admitted it does not reach the defendant\u2019s case. For when we come to consider how the creditor \u201c may \u201d thus lose his right, we learn that it can result only from some advantage gained by him, or from some prejudice suffered by the retiring partner. In other words, taking the authorities cited by the defence, and we are brought back, through the somewhat ambiguous, language that is made use of, to the well-known and well-established doctrine that a contract, in order to render it effective, must be founded upon a.consideration of some'kind, otherwise it is mere nudum pactum. Shorb\u2019s Ex\u2019rs <em>v. </em>Shultz, 7 Wr. 208.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-7\">. But in the affidavit of defence under discussion, there is no allegation of any consideration,- however remote, on which to base the ..alleged release. \u201cWalstrom and. Stevens said they were satisfied with Bowker as a debtor:;.that they had often done work for him. That they would release your deponent and look to him for the debt, which he was, and now is, able to pay.\u201d - This, is the sum and substance of the agreement. But here is, at best, but a promise to release on request of the defendant without consideration expressed or implied, nor does it appear that by reason of such promise the affiant has suffered any prejudice whatever. According to his own oath, Bowker is still solvent and responsible over to him. He therefore loses nothing by delay; he has but to pay the partnership debt and be repaid by his partner. Under these circumstances, were we to approve of the judgment of the court below, we must adopt the doctrine that a consideration purely moral in its character, an empty promise, without more, is sufficient to support a legal contract'. - Such certainly has never heretofore been the law, and we are not disposed, to be the first to attempt to make it so by the adoption of a principle,.the .utility of which would be more than doubtful.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>It is now ordered that the record in this case he remitted to the court below, in order that judgment may be entered by that court against the defendant as to it may seem just and right, unless other legal or equitable cause be shown why such judgment should not be so entered.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
