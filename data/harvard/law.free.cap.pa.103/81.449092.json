And this the defendant is ready to verify. Wherefore he prays judgment, &amp;c.\u201d |</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b98-5\">On the trial, before Thatek, P. J., the following facts appeared : \u2014 Laber was treasurer &lt;j&gt;f a beneficial society which became embarrassed and unable to continue business. A committee of seven members was appointed to collect and distribute the assets. Laber owed the society money which he failed to pay. A new treasurer was elected in his place, and a committee of three was appointed to settle with Laber. They caused him to be arrested on a charge of embezzlement, and in order to effect a settlement Laber gave the check in suit to J. M. Moyer, the attorney acting on behalf of the committee of three, saying at the time that he had no money in bank, but that if presentation was delayed until the following Monday he would make a deposit to meet i|t. The check was given on Wednesday, March 16th 1881. The society permitted Moyer to retain the check, in payment of fees due him, and on the Friday following Moyer passed it to the plaintiffs in a business settlement for a full consideration, without notice to or inquiry by the plaintiffs as to the circumstances under which the check had been given. On the same day the committee of seven, by their attorney, notified Laber toj pay no money belonging to the society to any one except said committee; whereupon Laber notified Moyer that he would not pay the check nor make any deposit to meet it. Moyer received this letter a few hours after ho had passed the check to the plaintiffs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b98-6\">The court charged the jury, inter alia, as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b98-7\">\u201c Taking a cheek after it is due is not alone notice of itself. It would seem from the testimony that the check was given on a Tuesday or Wednesday, and Mr. Laber, having no money in bank, requested that it should not be \u2022 presented until the fol<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>lowing Monday, when lie would make it good. According to the testimony \u00f3f Mr. Moyer, he paid the check to the plaintiffs on Friday. The fact that the check was taken by the plaintiffs two or three days after its date is a fact for the jury, and any other facts in connection with it might be received to show that the holder was put upon inquiry, but the fact standing alone is not notice of the defense here set up. It is not denied that Laber owed the money, and there is no reason that I can see why he should not pay it. The secretary testified that the society .was indebted to Mr. Moyer, and paid the check to him, and if that is so, a payment by Mr. Laber, even if it was the society\u2019s money, would be a payment by the society and they would be bound and Mr. Laber with it.\u2019\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b99-6\">Yerdiet and judgment for the plaintiffs for $240.10.

The check was drawn and delivered on Tuesday or Wednesday. The drawer said he had no money in bank then, and requested the payee to hold it until the Monday following. Two or three days after its date the payee passed it to the defendants in error for a valuable consideration. This time was not so long as to put them on inquiry in regard to the consideration on which it was drawn : Walker <em>v. </em>Geisse, 4 Whar. 256. It was presented for payment on the following Monday.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-11\">bio question as to an indorser being discharged from liability by delay in presenting the check for payment, nor of a failure of the bank in the mean time, arises in this case. The defence is by the drawer of the check. He seeks to attack the consideration, and show that it was improperly obtained from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>liim. ' As the defendants obtained it in good faith and for a valuable consideration at the time stated, it cannot be impeached in their hands. |</p>\n<p id=\"b100-5\">\u25a0 We further agree with the \u00a1learned judge that inasmuch as the plaintiff in error undoubtedly owed the money for which the check was given, no good reason is shown why he should not pay it. The assignments of error are not sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
