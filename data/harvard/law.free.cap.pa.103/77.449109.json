All the creditors except Zngsmitli and one or two others, signed an agreement that the account as filed should be affirmed, the balance divided, pro rata, and, provided it amounted to ten per centum of their claims, that they would release the assignor from all further claims on account of his indebtedness to them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b93-13\">The defendant alleged that those who did not actually sign, agreed to this compromise; that the agreement was proved before the auditor as signed by all but two creditors, and that Zugsmith was represented there, by attorney, and made no objection to this proof; that the fund being likely to fall short, Mrs. Hannah Isaacs, one of the largest creditors, while Zugsmith\u2019s attorney was present, withdrew part of her claim so that the compromise might be carried out and the dividend reach <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>ten per centum of the claims; that said attorney signed the acceptance of service of notice of the auditor\u2019s report, and made no objection to its confirmation. The defendant also alleged that he was alone with Zugsmith when the latter promised to release him, if all the general creditors should agree to 'the compromise. ;</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b94-6\">Shortly after suit was begun on the note, Zugsmith died and his administratrix was substituted as plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b94-7\">Zugsmith\u2019s death having deprived the defendant of his own testimony, he .offered:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b94-8\">(1) The auditor\u2019s report, to show that by the finding of \u2018the auditor, as reported, the creditors of said defendant had agreed to release him, the said defendant; this offer being made to \u25a0 preclude a recovery on this note, in this action. Offer refused. Exception.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b94-9\">: (2) To prove by a witness what declaration was made by Mr. Isaacs, the defendant, before the auditor in the said assigned estate, and' under oath, namely, that Mr. Zugsmith, the plaintiff, had agreed to sign the compromise paper, and that on the faith of this, settlement had been accepted 'by the other creditors at the dividend reported by the auditor; and that Mrs. Hannah Isaacs, one of the said creditors, represented by the witness, had agreed to let the settlement go through at ten per centum, and to further that end, as the fund was in danger of being short, had withdrawn a portion of her claim, so as to leave the dividends at ten per centum each. Refused. Exception.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b94-11\">(3) To prove by the same witness, that Mrs. Hannah Isaacs, a creditor, had agreed to withdraw a portion of her claim, to pay the auditor.and a watchman, provided the creditors agreed to compromise at ten per centum, so that a release of the defendant might occur on the payment of the dividends, and that Mrs. Isaacs, in fulfillment of this agreement, did withdraw a portion of her claim; that Mr. Folz, the attorney of the plaintiff, was present at the time and made no objection, and after-wards received the dividend, being the sum credited in this action. Refused. Exception.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b94-12\">Verdict for the plaintiff, for the full amount of the note, less the dividend of ten per centum received by him from the assignee, and judgment thereon. The defendant took this writ of error, assigning for error, the refusal of the court to admit his offers of evidence as above.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b94-13\"><em>Joseph De F. </em>Junlcin, for plaintiff in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Aja\">\u2014 If the defendant in error had been present personally at the auditor\u2019s meeting, and the jury had believed the account which we offered to give, he would have been estopped; and such evidence would have been admissible: Guiterman <em>v. </em>Landis, 1 W. N. C. 622. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>This is not altered by the fact that he was not there in person, but by attorney. The attorney was there as the principal would have been, and notice to him was notice to the principal: Wharton on Agency \u00a7 178; Silvis <em>v. </em>Ely, 3 W. &amp; S. 427; Hovil <em>v. </em>Pack, 7 East 164; Coleman <em>v. </em>Stark, 1 Oregon 115; Commonwealth <em>v. </em>Moltz, 10 Barr 530; Miller\u2019s Appeal, 3 Nor. 395; McClenkan <em>v. </em>McMillan, 6 Barr 367; Young <em>v. </em>Babilon, 10 Nor. 280.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b95-6\">But apart from all the relations between the plaintiff and defendant in the cause, the evidence as to the increase of the fund for distribution or the amount of the dividend, by the withdrawal of a portion of Mrs. Isaac\u2019s claim, as stated in the assignment of error, was certainly admissible. The assignee\u2019s fond would pay less than ten per cent. In consideration that all the \u00ab\u2019editors would release the assignor absolutely, upon payment of ten per cent., this lady gave what was practically a cash contribution to each creditor, so as to raise his dividend. The plaintiff\u2019s agent and attorney was present and gave no sign of dissent. The fund was subsequently distributed on that basis, and the increased dividend accepted by the agent\u2019s or attorney\u2019s principal. Can it be, under such circumstances, when the rights of third parties intervene, that the agent\u2019s silence, and the acceptance of the fruits of such silence, in no way hind a principal?</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b95-7\"><em>Leon II.

But since there was no dispute as to the ten per centum received, which was admitted on the trial, and allowed by the jury in making up their verdict, the offer was properly rejected. The Auditor was appointed, \u201c to audit, settle and adjust the account \u201d of the assignee, and his report is res adjndicata only as to the facts ionnd strictly in the line of his duty : Willis <em>v. </em>Willis, 2 Jones 159; Benson\u2019s Appeal, 12 Wr. 159; Sergeant\u2019s Ex'r <em>v. </em>Ewing, 6 Casey 81; Cowan <em>v. </em>Gonder, 5 Phila. 15.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b95-8\">Mr. Uhle\u2019s testimony was properly rejected. lie was called fo prove what Mr. Isaacs, the defendant below, testified to before the Auditor. This would clearly have been hearsay evidence, and thus objectionable, as well as for a much stronger reason ; to wit, the death of the plaintiff below : Proviso to Act 15th April, 1869, P.

Isaacs, who had assigned in trust for his creditors, and to distribute.the balance in the hands of the accountant. Nearly all the creditors having signed an agreement that the account as filed should be confirmed, the balance divided pro rata, and that they would release the assignor from all further claims on account of their debts, it being understood that the balance was about ten per centum of the amount of the debts, and none objecting, the Auditor merely made distribution. Zugsmith did not sign the agreement, and was not present at the audit; but his attorney was present, and after confirmation of the report, received- the dividend for his client.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-5\">There is no evidence that Zugsmith 'Pad any knowledge of what passed before the Auditor in relation to a compromise by the creditors, or of Mrs. Isaacs\u2019 release of part of her claim to induce the compromise, or that his attorney had any authority other than is implied by the relation of attorney and client. This is not the case of a creditor who orally agreed to a compromise and wittingly received the per centum on the same footing with the other creditors; but it is where the attorney appeared for his client before an Auditor appointed in course of legal proceedings, in pursuance of due notice, and made no objection to what was said and done by other creditors. The plaintiff in error contends that the creditor is affected as if he had been personally, present and afterwards took the dividend, on the ground that by taking it ho adopted the implied contract of compromise made by his attorney before the Auditor.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-6\">Not a circumstance indicates that the attorney had power to compromise. He was an officer of the court attending to his client\u2019s business in a legal proceeding. His duty was to see that a proper share of the fund was appropriated to the claim. That he did. Authority to compromise cannot be inferred from the bare relationship of attorney and client: Mackey\u2019s Heirs <em>v. </em>Adair, 39 Leg. Intell. 34. Persons dealing with an attorney-at-law respecting his client\u2019s business, may justly infer that he has all the power implied by the relation, fiut not that he has the powers of a general agent to compromise and release debts, or transfer and convey the goods or lands of his client. There must be some proof of agency beyond that implied by the relation, or of a ratification, to bind the client by acts of his attorney not within the scope of his duties as an attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-7\">The adjudication on its face shjows no distribution of money in excess of the balance in the hands of the accountant, no release of part of any creditor\u2019s claim, no warning to a creditor who was not a party to the agreement that his attorney had compromised his rights. It was not the duty of the attorney <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>to inform his client of agreements between other people. The creditors were notified to attend before the Auditor, for settlement of an account and distribution of the balance, not for compromising with their debtor. Had tlie client, in pursuance of an express notification fora meeting of the creditors to make a composition, attended by attorney, there would be some reason to infer that the attorney had authority to act, and for holding that his knowledge, obtained while acting within the scope of his duties, would be imputed to his client.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-6\">As the case stood before the court, foundation had not been laid for admission of the offers of testimony which were rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-7\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
