Where, by agreement of the parties filed, a caus\u00e9 is submitted to a referee, under the provisions of the Act of May 14th 1874 (P. L. 160), the decision of the referee must conform to the requirements provided by the Act of April 22d 1874 (P. L. 109), Mth respect to the decision of a court in the case of a submission under the last mentioned Act. That is, such decision must state separately and distinctly the facts found by the referee, the answers to points submitted, and the referee\u2019s conclusions of law; and judgment cannot be entered upon such decision until thirty days after filing and notice thereof to the parties. A referee\u2019s decision lacking the foregoing requisites will be set aside; and a judgment entered thereon without notice of its filing will be reversed upon writ of error.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b479-9\">2. Upon the trial,of an issue before such referee, the plaintiff put in evidence an alleged agreement of settlement between the parties; signed not by the defendant but by his attorney for him. The defendant offered to show that his attorney had no power to sign said agreement, and that the settlement thereby evidenced was incorrect. The defendant\u2019s offers of evidence recited certain transactions both prior to and since the date of the alleged settlement, whereby it was claimed that the plaintiff had been fully paid. The referee, holding that, the validity of said agreement had not been impeached, rejected evidence of all transactions prior to its date: <em>.Held, </em>to be error, and that the defendant\u2019s offers of testimony should have been admitted.</headnotes>\n<otherdate data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b479-10\">April 27th 1883.</otherdate>\n<judges data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"Aqz_\">Before Mercxje, O.

The judgment was erroneously entered the same day the referee\u2019s decision was filed, instead of after 30 days\u2019 notice to the parties. The defendants\u2019 offers of evidence were erroneously excluded by the referee. ' ...</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b482-15\"><em>W: 11. M. Oram (:Andrew H. Dill </em>with him). \u2014</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AnrC\">While the facts stated\u2019by the referee are not separately numbered, they are distinctly found, and the conclusion of law is deduced that the defendant owes to the plaintiff a stated amount. This would be sufficient as a special verdict, and -we contend, is sufficiently certain under the Act of May 14th 1874. That Act contains no requix-ernents as to the referee\u2019s decision except that the decision and wlxat pertains to it, shall be filed of recoxld in the case. The words, \u201c in like manner ... as in cases submitted in like manner to the court,\u201d refer only to the right of appeal axxd not to the duties of the referee. If it was intended to incoi\u2019pox-ate and re-enact in the Act of May 14th 1874, all the provisions of the Act of April 22d 1874, relating-to submissions to the court, such provisions should have been x-ecited in lime <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>verba; the constitution prohibits that result being accomplished by a mere general reference in one Act to the provisions of another Act. The referee\u2019s rulings on evidence are stated fully in the notes of evidence filed with the report, which alone this court can review: City of Philadelphia <em>v. </em>Linnard, 1 Out. 250.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"AMbS\">October 1st 1883.</decisiondate>\n<opinion data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b483-5\">Mr. Justice Gkeen</author>\n<p id=\"AZze\">delivered the opinion of the court,</p>\n<p id=\"b483-6\">This case was submitted by the parties, by agreement in writing and tiled of record, to the decision of a referee learned in the law, under the Act of May 14th 1874 (P. L. 16G). By the third section of the Act, the referee is required to proceed to perforin the duties of his appointment, in all things pertaining to the trial and decision of the ease, in the same manner in all respects as would be done by the court under a like submission. The section further provides that the decision together with what pertains to it shall be filed of record, and shall in like manner and to the same extent be subject to exceptions and writ of error or appeal, as in cases submitted in like manner to the court. The Act of April 22d 1874 (P. L. p. 109), which authorizes the submission of civil causes to the decision of the court, directs, in the second section, that the decision of the court shall bo in writing, stating separately and distinctly the facts found, the answers to any points submitted in writing by counsel, and the conclusions of law, and shall be filed within sixty days after the termination of the trial, whereupon notice of the filing shall forthwith be given to the parties by the prothonotary or clerk, in order that exceptions may be filed within thirty days after service of notice. In the present case none of these requirements was observed. On the first of December, 1882, the report of the referee, dated the same day, was filed in the prothouotary\u2019s office. The meeting, under the reference, wras ordered for the 10th of July 1882, but the appendix containing the evidence does not show the date of any meeting, or of the closing of the trial. It is alleged, however, and not denied, that the report was not filed until 133 days after the trial. There is no finding by the referee of any facts or any conclusions of lawq and in reality the report coutains nothing but an award that there was due, on the judgment in question, the sum of $10,155.27, on December 1st 1882, and a direction that judgment be entered for that amount with costs. On the day of the date of the report judgment was entered upon it, in express violation of the provision of the Act, which only authorizes judgment to be entered after the expiration of thirty days after notice by the prothonotary of the filing of the report, for the very purpose of allowing exceptions to be filed. No opportunity was afforded for filing exceptions after the report and before <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>judgment. It is too plain for argument that the proceedings were fatally defective and erroneous throughout, and the jndg- \u2022 ment must therefore be reversed. It is indispensable to the validity of the report.of a referee under the Act of May 14th 1874, that it should state separately and distinctly the facts found and the conclusions of law resulting from the facts. In Butterfield <em>v. </em>Lathrop, 21 P. F. S. 229, we held, Siiaeswood, J'., that, \u201c it is evident that the xict contemplates that there shall be in each case what is equivalent to a special verdict. The finding of the referee must have the same certainty and fullness as is required in a special verdict, so that the judgment shall be the conclusion of law upon the facts.\u201d This language is used with reference to the fourth section of the Act of April 6th 1869 (P. L. p. 725), authorizing the reference of civil 'actions in the county of Bradford. The language of that section is, so far as it relates to this subject, as follows: \u201c The said referee shall state the facts found and the conclusions of law separately.\u201d The other provisions of the Act of 1869 are in substance very similar to those of the Act of May 14th 1874, and the principle of the above decision is quite applicable to the interpretation of the latter Act. As a writ of error or appeal lies directly from the decision of the referee to this court it is all the more important that every right of review which would have been enjoyed in cases submitted to the court, should be protected. 'We held, in City of Philadelphia <em>v. </em>Linnard, 1 Out. 250, construing the Act of May 14th 1874, that the court of common pleas has no jurisdiction to review the action of the referee; that this could only be done by the supreme court on error or appeal, and that the referee\u2019s findings of fact are as conclusive as the verdict of a jury. We held also, that this Act was similar to the prior local Acts of 1869 and 1870, referring to the cases of Thornton <em>v. </em>Enterprise Ins. Co., 21 P. F. S. 234, and Butterfield <em>v. </em>Lathrop, Id. 225, and that the Act of 1874 in reference to the effect to be given to the report of the referee, has the same intendment as those Acts. The essential requisites of a special verdict are fully described in Vansyckel <em>v. </em>Stewart, 27 P. F. S. 124, and, tested by the rule there stated the report of the referee in the present case is entirely defective and void.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-4\">We are also of opinion that the referee was in error in rejecting the offers of proof covered by the third, fourth, fifth and sixth assignments of error. Those matters offered in evidence must be assumed as true, for the purposes of this argument, and, as such, they constituted the whole history of the transaction as alleged by the defendant, and he certainly could not be precluded from having them considered, by the allegation that they had all been finally settled by the action of his attorney. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>when a part of his offer was to prove that the attorney had no authority from him to make a binding settlement of the matters in controversy. We think the proper course for the referee would have been to hear all of this testimony, and then, upon all the evidence in the case, to report separately and distinctly all the facts found by him material and pertinent .to the issue, and also his conclusions of law upon the facts found, and conclude by reporting whether anything, and if so, how much was due upon the judgment in question. The case could then have been fully reviewed upon all its merits of law and fact, a course which it is impossible to adopt now as we have no findings or conclusions before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-6\">Judgment reversed, report and award set aside, and procedendo awarded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
