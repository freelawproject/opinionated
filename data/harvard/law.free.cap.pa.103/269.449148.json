' ...</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b286-6\">, . On motion, a comp.ulsory non-suit was granted by the court, based upon the following reasons, as stated by Woodward, J. :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AIU\">\u201c Well, gentlemen, 1 am obliged to take a certain view of this case. c I will protect the rights, however, of all parties by granting a rule which will enable us to examine it more thoroughly at another time. Under my view of the. case, at present, I hold that this note should have been indorsed by the payee in order to pass title to a third party ; secondly, that it lias not been so indorsed; thirdly, that the signature claimed to be an indorsement is intended to apply or does apply to the certificate or contract on the back of the note, and is not such an indorsement as the law contemplates is necessary to pass title to the note. I do not think that the signature in question can have a two-fold force \u2014 one as a contract growing out of the certificate, and the other as an indorsement of negotiable paper. For these reasons the motion for non-suit must prevail. We enter a rule at the same time to show cause why the non-suit shall not be taken off to be placed on the argument list.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b286-8\">A rule to take off the non-suit was subsequently discharged, and judgment was entered for.the defendant. W.hereupon the plaintiff took this'writ of error, assigning for error the refusal of the court to take off the non-suit.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b286-9\"><em>John \u25a0MeGahren </em>(with whom was <em>Garrick M. </em>Harding), for plaintiff in error. \u2014</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AdHE\">:The defendant\u2019s transfer of the note in suit, when consummated by delivery, was sufficient to render him liable as maker, and his liability did not spring from his indorsement alone. The defendant was both maker and payee, and his promise to pay to his own order, six months after date, at a place specified, was certain and unconditional. The indorsement that \u201c the within obligation is given for goods bought by me,\u201d followed by. a delivery, constituted a sufficient' transfer. The unnecessary averment in the certificate of transfer, that the maker owned property of a certain value in excess of his \u25a0liabilities should not prejudice or affect it. \u2022 The certificate does not contain any condition .or contingency which would delay or impede the collection of the note. As was said by Mi\\ Justice Read, in Zimmerman <em>v. </em>Anderson, <em>\u201c </em>Instead of clogging its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>negotiability it adds to it, and gives additional value to the note 67 Pa. St. 422. No particular form of indorsement is prescribed by law in order to negotiate paper: Ege <em>v. </em>Kyle, 2 Watts 223. \u25a0 The indorsement is usually made by writing one\u2019s name across the back of the paper. <em>\u201c </em>And, if any other words are placed over or precede the signature, it is sufficient, if they import a present intent to transfer the same thereby: Story on Promissory Notes 121; Thorne <em>v. </em>Woodhull, 29 Ill. 92; Chaworth <em>v. </em>Beech, 4 Vesey 555. The indorsement may be in the form of a guaranty: Partridge <em>v. </em>Davis, 20 Ver. 499; Upham <em>v. </em>Prince, 12 Mass. 14; Myrick <em>v. </em>Hasey, 27 Me. 9; Childs <em>v. </em>Davidson, 38 Ill. 438. No allusion was made to the affidavit of defence at the trial, but the note and indorsements were admitted in evidence without objection. This was a waiver of the right to demand proof of signatures : Diamond Coal Co. <em>v. </em>Schultz, 71 Pa. 180; Wharton on Evidence, \u00a7 1136; Greenleaf on Ev. vol. 1, p. 169.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b287-6\"><em>Hubbard B. </em>Payne, for defendant in error.- \u2014</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A1z\">If there were nothing except the face of the paper in the suit, nothing whatever on the back, there could be no recovery on it: Daniels on Negotiable Instruments, \u00a7 130, Note 3. \u2022 Nor is there anything on the back of the instrument which makes it negotiable. The affidavit of defence denied the genuineness of Heller\u2019s signature on the back. By rule 15 of the court of common pleas of Luzerne county, when, in such an action as this, a signature is denied by affidavit, the plaintiff must prove the signature before offering the note in evidence. This was not done in the present instance, and no indorsement whatever has been legally shown. But even if the signature of Heller were genuine, it does not amount to a legal indorsement. Indorsement technically means, writing one\u2019s name on an instrument with intent to incur the liability of a party who warrants payment of the instrument, provided it is properly presented for payment to the principal and the indorser duly notified of his refusal : Daniels on Negotiable Instruments, \u00a7 667. The writing on this instrument is simply, First, a certificate that Heller has |4,000 worth of property; Second, that the paper was given in settlement of claims between him and the Queen City Fertilizing Company.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"Alh\">April 30th 1883.</decisiondate>\n<opinion data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b287-7\">Mr. Justice Paxsox</author>\n<p id=\"AXo\">delivered the opinion of the court,</p>\n<p id=\"b287-8\">The note in controversy was offered in evidence without objection on 'the part of defendant. This disposes of the argument based on the rule of court and the affidavit of defence. Conceding the right of the defendant to demand proof of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>signature, he waived it by allowing the note to go in without objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">The learned judge below, however, non-suited the plaintiff, for the reason that the note was not indorsed. It was made payable to the order of the maker.' His name was written across the back of the note in the - place where indorsements are usually placed. Over his signature we find the following words:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b288-6\"><em>\u201c </em>I hereby certify that I own and am worth, in personal and real estate, in the County of Luzerne, State of Pa., \u00a74,000 over and above all indebtedness, and that the within obligation is given for goods bought by me of the Queen City Fertilizing Company, and the same is in full settlement of all claims and demands of every name and nature between said company and myself up to the date of this obligation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b288-7\">(Signed) Renatus Heller.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b288-8\">The learned judge in granting the motion for a non-suit, said : \u201c I do not think that the signature in question can have a two-fold force \u2014 one as a contract growing out of the certificate, and the other as an indorsement of negotiable paper.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b288-9\">We do not think the words over the indorsement amount to a contract. They contain a statement as to \u00bflie indorser\u2019s pecuniary responsibility and the consideration of the note. It was unnecessary and perhaps foolish for the maker to put all this over his signature as indorser. ' But he has done it, and as it does not vary his contract as maker and indorser, we are unable to say, as a matter of law, that the note was not indorsed as required by the commercial law. Nor was the learned judge strictly- accurate in saying that the signature cannot have a two-fold force. The indorser may waive protest over his indorsement, which manifestly gives a two-fold character to his signature and affects the rights of the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-10\">It was held in Ege <em>v. </em>Kyle, 2 Watts 222, that an indorsement \u00f3n a negotiable note of a receipt on account of a quantity of iron,- \u201c the net proceeds of which are to be credited on the within,\u201d and which were afterwards credited on it by indorsement, did' not destroy its negotiable character. The usual form of indorsement, is by writing the name of the indorser across the back of the note. When the note is payable to order any order in writing is sufficient which shows an intent to pass the title. Thus : \u201cI give this note to A., George Ohaworth,\u201d was held to be a sufficient indorsement: Chaworth <em>v. </em>Beech, 4 Vesey 555. And where the indorsement is in the form of a guaranty, it has been held sufficient: Partridge <em>v. </em>Davis, 20 Vermont 499; Upham <em>v. </em>Prince, 12 Mass. 14; Myrick <em>v. </em>Hasey, 27 Me. 9; Childs <em>v. </em>Davidson, 38 Ill. 438; Watson <em>v. </em>McLaren, 19 Wend. 557.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>This disposes of the single point in the case. No other question is properly presented upon the record and no other will be discussed.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">Judgment reversed and a procedendo awarded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
