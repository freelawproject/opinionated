That George A. Berry, notary public, having made one certificate to the acknowledgment of lease from Maryette Sheedy and Patrick. Sheedy, her husband, dated September 11th 1876, under which plaintiffs claim in this case, and said lease and acknowledgment having been recorded September 22d 1876, his authority and power to act ceased and he had no lawful authority to make another certificate of such acknowledgment after, that date.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b510-11\">Answer. Affirmed. .</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b510-12\">2. The defendant, Maryette Sheedy,. being in possession of the premises in dispute, claiming title thereto as her separate estate at the' date of said lease and such possession and claim of title having been by her fully made known to the plaintiff, before the making of such lease, and she being, at the date thereof a married woman, and the certificate of acknowledgment of said lease failing to show that the contents of said lease were made known to her before she signed and executed the same, np title passed to the plaintiffs thereby.\u201d ,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b510-13\">Answer. Affirmed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b510-14\">In tlie general charge the court said, inter alia: \u201cWe say .to, y.ou for the present, gentlemen, that while that lease is sufficient-in, form to pass title of both lessors, yet the acknowledgment-is defective. We further instruct you that when the lease was placed on record the power of the notary over the in7 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>strumentwas gone. The result of this instruction to you is that the title of the Enterprise Transit Company depends upon the first acknowledgment, and as that was not taken in such manner as to hind Mrs. Sheedy, we shall accordingly direct a verdict to be entered for the defendants ; but we shall entertain a motion to show cause why a new trial shall not be granted in order that the rights of the parties may be further considered.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b511-6\">Verdict, as directed, for the defendants. The court granted, and subsequently discharged a rule for a new trial, and entered judgment on the verdict; whereupon the plaintiff took this writ of error, assigning for error the affirmance of the defendants\u2019 points and the instruction of the court to the jury to find for the defendants, and the entry of judgment.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b511-7\"><em>Hamlin &lt;&amp; Son </em>and IF. <em>B. Chapman, </em>for the plaintiffs in error. \u2014</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AGl\">The only statute which refers to or indicates a time when the certificate of the acknowledgment is to be made is the Act of 2d May 1715, Pur. Dig. 460 pi. 11, and is in these words : \u201c Whereupon the same justice shall, under his hand and seal, certify such acknowledgment or proof, upon the back of the deed, with the day and year when the same was made,, and by whom.\u201d (It is said in Watson <em>v. </em>Bailey, 1 Binney 470, that \u201c the Act of 24th of February, 1770, evidently points to the same mode of certificate.\u201d) The word \u201cwhereupon,4\u2019 according to Webster, signifies \u201cupon which : in consequence of which.\u201d Thus, the only requirement of, the statute as to the time when the certificate is to be made, is that it be done after the acknowledgement has been taken, and in consequence of it. In Stevens <em>v. </em>Martin, 6 Harris 101, a deed was acknowledged before a judge of the court of common pleas of Hunterdon county, New Jersey, on.the 26th of October 1796, and a certificate of this acknowledgment was made by the clerk of that court, on the 24th of October 1849. The deed being for lands in Pennsylvania, and offered in evidence in an ejectment tried in Mercer county, was objected to, and the objection overruled, and the deed admitted in evidence. The supreme court, in affirming the judgment, use this l\u00e1nguage : \u201c The objection to the interval between the acknowledgment before the judge, and the date of the certificate of the clerk of the court, is not sneh as will vitiate it, and prevent the admission of the deed in evidence; circumstances may prevent the acknowledgment and certificate from being consecutive, and it is not essential they should be.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b511-8\">In Sheldon <em>v. </em>Stryker, 42 Barbour 284, it is held to be sufficient if the certificate of acknowledgment is endorsed on the deed when offered in evidence.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b511-9\">J.u Wannall <em>v. </em>Korn, 51 Missouri Rep. 151, a mortgage wras<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>executed for,the wife\u2019s l\u00e1nds. The acknowledgment was properly, made, but the notary failed to, state in his certificate the facts necessary to constitute a proper acknowledgment. A bill in equity was filed, making the notary \u00e1 defendant, and asking a decree requiring him to correct the omission. The court held that a court of equity is not the proper forum to afford the relief, but they say: \u201c The officer may voluntarily correct his certificate, or make out a proper certificate, where he has given a defective one, if the facts really exist to warrant such action: If the officer refuses to make a proper certificate, he may be compelled to do so by mandamus, but a court of equity has no .jurisdiction..to correct such defects. The notary derives-his authority to take acknowledgments from the statute, and courts of equity do not aid the defective execution of statutory powers.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b512-4\">.The doctrine of this case was affirmed in Miller <em>v. </em>Powell, 53 Missouri Rep. 252, and in it the court say : \u201c The officer taking the acknowledgment, acts under a statutory power, and a court of equity cannot aid the defective execution of such a power. The only remedy would be to apply to the officer to put his certificate in form, and if he refused to comply, he might be compelled to do so by mandamus.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b512-5\">It is submitted that Elliott <em>v. </em>Peirsol, 1 Peters 328, relied on by the defendants in error, is not authority for this case. It has been uniformly held by the courts of this and other states that the taking of the acknowledgment .of a deed is a \u201c judicial act.\u201d The statute requires the grantors to be present at the taking of the acknowledgment, but not at the certificate thereof ; the latter is a ministerial act; any person may draw the certificate ; the officer affixes his name to it as evidence that he has done flie judicial a'ct. The law requires a class of deeds to be acknowledged in open court. The judge holding the court takes the acknowledgment. This is the judicial act. The judge passes the deeds down to the clerk who makes the certificate. This is a ministerial act. The judge may discover the next day, or the next term, the clerk has made a mistake in the, certificate, and that it needs to be corrected to conform to the truth. The sheriff, or other person, who made the acknowledgment may not be present, or if present, may be unwilling to re-acknowledge. Can it be said.thatthe court, or the judge before, whom the acknowledgment was taken, is functus officio, .and is-without power to cause the correction ? Suppose the notary had made this discovery of the omission in his first certificate, immediately after he had signed it; will'it be doubted that he then had the power to insert the. missing words ? Or, that: he had power to erase the certificate he had made and attach another ? If so, when did his power cease until he eer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>tilled to the truth, as required by law to do, or until the rights of new parties intervened ? All the adjudged cases rest the sufficiency of the acknowledgment on the certificate of the officer, and not on the time when made. The acknowledgment, of the lease in question was certified according to law, and the controversy is between the original parties and affecting them only.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b513-6\">It will be urged that a deed is only effective after delivery, and that a married woman\u2019s deed has no validity to pass title until acknowledged. All this granted, but her title does not pass by the certificate of acknowledgment. The title passes when slio acknowledges the instrument according to law, and delivers it. The instrument cannot be used as evidence of title until properly certified. The certificate showing the acknowledgment is essential only as rendering it evidence, in the same manner as affixing a revenue stamp required by the Act of congress was essential before permitting the instrument to be read. The absence of the stamp did not render it void. When this married woman with her husband signed the lease, acknowledged it according to law, and placed it in the hands of the notary to be certified and delivered to the lessee, her title passed. She had nothing further to do with it, and no further power over it: Blight <em>v. </em>Schenck, 10 Barr 285.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b513-7\">A grantor may prove by parol that the certificate of acknowledgment is false, or that the acknowledgment was procured by fraud or coercion, and remit the parties to tlieir original position: Michener <em>v. </em>Cavender, 2 Wright 334; Louden <em>v. </em>Blythe, 4 Harris 532; Schrader <em>v. </em>Decker, 9 Barr 14; Heeter <em>v. </em>Glasgow, 29 P. F. S. 79. Why in reason may not a grantee have rendered valid, under the forms of law, a deed/ which confessedly was executed and delivered, bona fide, and with the intent of passing the title <em>% </em>The protection the law has thrown about the property of a married woman is to be used as a shield, and not as a lance.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b513-8\"><em>O. A. Ilotelikm </em>and <em>N. B. </em>Smiley, for the defendants in error. \u2014</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AAm\">The question is one of devolution of title to real estate. Title was in Mrs. Sheedy at the date of the lease.. There was but one statutory mode by which she could divest herself of it, viz., by deed, separately acknowledged in accordance with all the statutory requisites, which facts must affirmatively appear on the face of the certificate : Jourdan <em>v. </em>Jourdan, 9 S. &amp; R. 272, and cases there cited; Graham <em>v. </em>Long, 15 P. F. S. 387. The original certificate in this case not showing the requisite acknowledgment by Mrs. Slieedy, it is certain that no title to the real estate passed out of her by the delivery of the instrument. As she never did anything further, it is equally clear that the acts of the notary or of other parties could not operate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>to divest her title; or, as expressed in Glidden <em>v. </em>Strupler, 2 P. F. S. 400, \u201c The contract to convey being absolutely void because of incapacity, its ratification is equally forbidden unless by deed in the mode prescribed by the statutes. ETo multiplication of deeds (and they are the most solemn acts in pais by which title can be transferred), will serve to ratify the void conveyance, unless made according to statute. Much less can express ratification by parol . . . infuse life into that which has no yitality.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b514-6\">The case is ruled by Elliott <em>v. </em>Peirsol, 1 Peters 328.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"AdU\">May 21st 1883.</decisiondate>\n<opinion data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b514-7\">The opinion of the court was filed</p>\n<author id=\"b514-8\">Pee Cukiam.</author>\n<p id=\"Ab-\">This attempt to impart life to a void instrument lias the merit of novelty. When Mrs. Sheedy affixed her name to the written instrument and acknowledged it, the acknowledgment was confessedly so defective as not to bind her or pass her title to the land. It was then delivered, and eleven days thereafter recorded. More than five months after the acknowledgment was actually taken, and the certificate thereof signed by the notary public indorsed thereon, he wrote and signed a second certificate of acknowledgment. The parties to the instrument did not again come before him, but he certifies what occurred months before. To this last certificate be adds facts not contained in bis former certificate, with a view and for the purpose of making valid the writing of a married woman, which was then invalid. Effect cannot be given to this latter aetion of the notary public.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-9\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
