Coleman from an order of said court, dismissing his exceptions to and confirming an appraisement of certain real estate, levied upon in execution, and awarding $300 of the proceeds of a sheriff\u2019s sale thereof, to the defendant in the execution, under his claim for exemption.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b383-6\">The facts of the case were as follows : On April 19th 1880, Peter Coleman obtained judgment in the common pleas of Montgomery county against T. Coleman for $1,300. On March 27th 1882, $700 of this sum remained unpaid, and plaintiff issued a fi. fa. to June Term, 1882, under which the sheriff levied on certain lands of the defendant. Before the return day of the writ, to wit, on May 9th 1882, the defendant gave the sheriff a written notice that he claimed the benefit of the exemption law out of the said real estate levied on, and demanded an appraisement thereof. No notice was taken of this claim by the sheriff, who made return of the fi. fa., and a jury of inquisition condemned the said real estate, which the court confirmed. The plaintiff then issued a writ of vend. ex. to sell the real estate levied on, and the sheriff accordingly advertised it to be sold on August 23d 1882. On the morning of the sale the sheriff appointed three appraisers, who certified that the said real estate could not be divided so as to set off a tract of the value of $300, \u201c and that the sum of $300 due the defendant under the exemption act shall be paid to the defendant out of the proceeds of said real estate; that is to say that the defendant\u2019s interest in said real estate under this appraisement is $300.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b383-7\">The plaintiff filed exceptions to said appraisement, inter alia:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b383-8\">\u201c Because said appraisement is illegal and void in that it was not made under the fi. fa. issued on the judgment of the plaintiff <em>v. </em>the defendant, and because it was made at a time when the sheriff could not hold it, to wit: long after the writ of vend. ex. was issued under which the sale was made of defendant\u2019s real estate, and on the day of the sale, without notice to the plaintiff in the execution.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b383-9\">The court, Boyer, P. J., dismissed the said exceptions, and confirmed the appraisement, on the authority of Seibert\u2019s Appealed P. F. S. 359 ; whereupon the plaintiff took this appeal, assigning for error the said order of the court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b383-10\"><em>B. F.

He made that claim before the return day of the writ, and in due form. The delay of the sheriff in causing the appraisement to be made, was not caused by the appellee, and his right to the benefit of the exemption ivas not thereby defeated. Although the appraisement was unduly postponed by the sheriff, yet ivben made, the benefits thereof vested in the appellee. He is not bound to resort to an action against the sheriff, but may claim the $300 out of the fund produced by a sale of the whole land : Seibert\u2019s Appeal, 23 P. F. Smith 359.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-8\">Decree affirmed and appeal dismissed at the costs of the appellant.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
