But when the Plaintiff\u2019s costs cannot be recovered of the Defendant, there is no reason why the Plaintiff should not pay them. And so it was held, in <em>Merrit </em>v. <em>Merrit, </em>and <em>Brehon </em>v. <em>Tatom\u2019s adm\u2019r. </em>(1 <em>Hay. </em>20). I therefore think, that in this case, the motion ought to have been allowed in the Superior Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-7\">Per Curiam, Judgment reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
