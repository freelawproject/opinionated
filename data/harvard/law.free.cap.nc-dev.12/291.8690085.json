His honor Judge Strange being of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>a (5i(ferent opinion, nonsuited the Plaintiff who appealed to this Court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b292-5\">No Counsel appeared for the Plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"Av6U\">Badger, for the Defendant, submitted the case.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b292-7\">Ham, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"AZDb\">The by-law under which the penalty in question is claimed, is not stated in the case ; but we are told that the Plaintiff founds his right to sue for it, under the 5th section of' the act of 1802, c. 29.. That section declares, that \u201c it shall be the duty of said Treasurer, in his own name, to sue for and recover all forfeitures which shall accrue <em>under this or any other act \u25a0heretofore passed.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b292-8\">Now the penalty sought to be recovered, is not a penalty accruing for a direct breach of the act itself, as where the Constable refuses to execute a warrant, or process, directed to him from the Magistrate of Police <em>; </em>but I think, by a liberal construction, it is a penalty <em>accruing under the act. </em>If the Commissioners are authorised to make by laws, (which is not disputed,) no doubt penalties are imposed for a breach of them, and such penalties indirectly accrue finder the provisions of the act which gave the power of imposing them, although they accrued directly under the by-law. No inconvenience can result from this construction of the act. The case is substantially within its meaning. \u2014 I therefore think, the nonsuit should be set aside, and a new trial granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-9\">Per Curiam. \u2014 Judgment reversed, and a new trial ' granted.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
