United States, </em>116 U.S. 616, 635, 6 S.Ct. 524, 535, 29 L.Ed. 746 (1886). With this admonition guiding our path, we proceed to consider the issue presented on this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-4\">Kenneth Barry Smith, appellant, was convicted at a bench trial in the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County of assault with intent to murder, robbery with a deadly weapon, and use of a handgun in the commission of a crime of violence. His sentences for these offenses, a total of 49 years to the custody of the Division of Correction, were ordered served consecutively to a sentence he received in another <em>case</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em>. </em>On appeal, appellant presents a single issue: Whether the trial court erred in denying his pretrial motion to suppress a sweatshirt seized in his apartment at the time of his arrest and a statement given the police subsequent to his arrest.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b480-5\">The testimony presented at the hearing on the motion to suppress disclosed the facts surrounding appellant\u2019s arrest and the giving of his statement. Shortly after midnight on November 11, 1985, Detective Hauf and other members of the Anne Arundel County Police Department responded to the murder scene to investigate the November 9, 1985 murder of one William Conlee. As a part of that investigation, one James Costlow, the murder victim\u2019s roommate, was questioned. In the course of this questioning, Costlow provided information linking appellant to the November 5, 1985 robbery of Robert H. Massey, an employee of the Big Red service station on Baltimore-Annapolis Boulevard in Glen Burnie. Specifically, Costlow told the police that on the evening of November 5th, he dropped appellant off <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>across the street from the Big Red station so that appellant could \u201ccase\u201d the station. He then drove to a church, approximately two blocks away, to wait for appellant. When appellant did not join him within a short time, Cost-low returned to the area of the Big Red station, where he observed an ambulance and law enforcement personnel on the scene. He learned at that time that the station\u2019s attendant had been shot during the course of an armed robbery of the station. When Costlow saw appellant the next day and asked him what had happened, appellant allegedly responded that \u201che had to shoot the guy because he came at him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b481-4\">Edwin and Brenda Pearson were also questioned in connection with the murder investigation. Each made a statement implicating appellant in the Big Red holdup. According to Edwin Pearson, on the evening of the holdup, he, Costlow and a woman named Laura Knott waited in Cost-low\u2019s vehicle, the \u201cgetaway\u201d vehicle, while appellant went to rob the gas station. Although appellant was supposed to meet them at the church where they had parked, he never did. Pearson also admitted supplying the gun used by appellant in the armed robbery and to its having been returned to him by appellant on November 9, 1985, sometime after William Conlee was shot; however, Pearson reported that the gun was no longer in his possession.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-5\">Having concluded their questioning of James Costlow and the Pearsons at approximately 9:30 p.m. on November 11, 1985, the investigating officers decided to arrest the appellant for the November 5th armed robbery at the Big Red station.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Without attempting to obtain an arrest warrant and with Costlow accompanying them for the purpose of pointing out appellant\u2019s residence, Detective Hauf and Ser<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>geant Collier proceeded to the house in Glen Burnie in which appellant\u2019s apartment<footnotemark>3a</footnotemark> was located. By 10:30 p.m., at least five other Anne Arundel County police officers had arrived and positioned themselves around the house. After evacuating residents of the second floor of the house and confirming that appellant rented a first floor apartment, the police knocked on the door to appellant\u2019s apartment. When appellant answered the door and, in response to Sergeant Collier\u2019s inquiry, identified himself as \u201cKenny Smith,\u201d appellant was immediately placed under arrest. In effecting the arrest, Detective Hauf, Sergeant Collier and Detective Harp entered the one-room apartment, at which time, Detectives Hauf and Harp observed a sweatshirt, which \u201cmatched the description of the sweatshirt worn by the gentleman who did in fact rob the Big Red gas station,\u201d in plain view on a chair in the apartment. The sweatshirt was seized. Upon closer examination, Detective Hauf observed what appeared to be a spot of blood on the front of the sweatshirt. Then, without conducting a search of the apartment at that time, the police removed the appellant from the apartment and \u201csecured a perimeter around it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b482-5\">Appellant was taken to the police department\u2019s Criminal Investigation Division Headquarters in Crownsville. No attempt to interrogate appellant was made during that trip. At the station, appellant was taken to an interrogation room and given a cup of coffee. He was then advised of his Miranda<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> rights and, at 12:30 a.m. on November 12, 1985, signed a waiver of rights form. Detective Hauf testified that, at that time, appellant stated that he did not want a lawyer, but that he \u201cwanted to finish his cup of coffee and ... to think about whether or not he wanted to speak with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>us.\u201d The detectives left the interrogation room at that point.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-5\">Detective Hauf returned to the interrogation room a short time later and asked appellant to consent to the search of his apartment. Appellant agreed and signed a consent form. The search of appellant\u2019s apartment resulted in the discovery of a wallet matching James Costlow\u2019s description of William Conlee\u2019s wallet.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-6\">Detective Harp was in the interrogation room with appellant from 1:10 a.m. until 2:15 a.m. talking to him about general matters such as \u201cwhere he\u2019s been the last week, who his friends were in the area____\u201d During this time, Detective Hauf was \u201cin and out\u201d. At 2:15 a.m., Detective Harp asked appellant whether he was ready to make a statement, to which appellant replied that he wanted more time to think about it. Detective Harp then got appellant another cup of coffee and left him alone in the room for 15 minutes. At 2:30 a.m., appellant asked to go to the bathroom, and Detective Hauf escorted him there. When appellant returned to the interrogation room, he was joined by Detective Harp, who remained until 3:10 a.m. At that time, Detective Hauf joined them and informed appellant of the discovery of the wallet at his apartment. Appellant again indicated that he needed more time to think. He was then left alone. At 3:55 a.m., Detective Hauf entered the room and asked appellant to consent to the taking of a hair sample. Appellant agreed, signed a consent form, and permitted the police to procure the hair sample. Appellant was once again left alone in the interrogation room.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-9\">Sergeant Collier entered the interrogation room at approximately 4:30 a.m. He advised appellant of the charges, including that of first degree murder, that were being placed against him. Sergeant Collier also mentioned the possible sentences appellant could receive if convicted of those charges, including the possibility of the death penalty for the murder charge. He remained in the room with appellant until sometime between 5:30 and 6:00 a.m. During that time, he engaged appellant in what Collier de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>scribed as \u201ca man to man, heart to heart session.\u201d Before leaving, he asked whether appellant wanted to make a statement; appellant again replied that he wanted to think about it.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">At 6:05 a.m. appellant knocked on the door to the interrogation room. When Detective Hauf opened the door, appellant stated that he was ready to make a statement. Having been re-advised of his <em>Miranda </em>rights and in the presence of Detective Hauf and Sergeant Collier, appellant gave a statement in which he confessed to killing William Conlee and to the November 5th armed robbery of the attendant at the Big Red station. At the conclusion of the statement, which commenced at 6:55 a.m. and ended at 8:50 a.m. on November 12, 1985, appellant was processed and taken before a District Court commissioner in Glen Burnie.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-6\">In challenging the denial of his motion to suppress, appellant argues that his arrest was illegal and that, the evidence obtained as a result of that arrest, being tainted by the illegality, should have been suppressed. While conceding that the police had probable cause to arrest him, he points out that the' police arrested him in his home without obtaining a warrant, a point that is not in dispute, and asserts that there were no exigent circumstances justifying the warrantless entry, a point also conceded by the State. Thus, appellant argues that he was arrested in violation of the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution. He relies heavily on <em>Payton v. New York, </em>445 U.S. 573, 100 S.Ct. 1371, 63 L.Ed.2d 639 (1980), and <em>Welsh v. Wisconsin, </em>466 U.S. 740, 104 S.Ct. 2091, 80 L.Ed.2d 732 (1984), in both of which the Supreme Court discussed, at length, the permissible parameters of warrantless arrests.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-7\">The State, on the other hand, responds that appellant\u2019s arrest in this case need not be justified by exigent circumstances because, in effecting the arrest, the police did not violate the sanctity of appellant\u2019s home, <em>i.e. </em>gain entry with the use of force or with the consent of someone other than appellant. Proceeding on the premise that the Fourth Amendment\u2019s protection against warrantless intrusions by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>the police into the home is dependent upon an individual\u2019s reasonable expectation of privacy in his home and relying on <em>United States v. Santana, </em>427 U.S. 38, 96 S.Ct. 2406, 49 L.Ed.2d 300 (1976), the State proffers that when an individual voluntarily opens his door in response to a knock, he exposes himself to public view and thus gives up his expectation of privacy. Therefore, the argument continues, since the police may make an arrest upon probable cause in any public place, <em>United States v. Watson, </em>423 U.S. 411, 96 S.Ct. 820, 46 L.Ed.2d 598 (1976), and since appellant, by voluntarily opening his door in response to a knock, was in a \u201cpublic place\u201d in the sense that he exposed himself to the view, speech, hearing and touch of whomever was at the door, appellant was lawfully arrested.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-4\">In <em>Santana, </em>which was decided four years before <em>Pay-ton, </em>the police had probable cause to believe that \u201cMom\u201d Santana had in her possession marked money that she had received in a controlled sale of heroin that took place only minutes earlier. Santana was standing in the doorway<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> of her house, holding a brown paper bag when the police arrived. The police having stopped their van within 15 feet of her and having exited, shouting \u201cpolice\u201d and displaying identification, Santana retreated in the vestibule. The officers followed through the open door. They caught and arrested her in the vestibule, seizing the marked money from her person. They also seized two bundles of heroin that had fallen out of the paper bag Santana had been holding. The Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit affirmed the District Court\u2019s order suppressing the evidence. The Supreme Court reversed, reasoning that Santana was in a \u201cpublic\u201d place when she stood in the open doorway of her house:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-5\">While it may be true that under the common law of property the threshold of one\u2019s dwelling is \u201cprivate,\u201d as is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>the yard surrounding the house, it is nonetheless clear that under the cases interpreting the Fourth Amendment Santana was in a \u201cpublic\u201d place. She was not in an area where she had any expectation of privacy. \u201cWhat a person knowingly exposes to the public, even in his own house or office, is not a subject of Fourth Amendment protection.\u201d <em>Katz v. United States, </em>389 U.S. 347, 351 [88 S.Ct. 507, 511, 19 L.Ed.2d 576] (1967). She was not merely visible to the public but was as exposed to public view, speech, hearing, and touch as if she had been standing completely outside her house. <em>Hester v. United States, </em>265 U.S. 57, 59 [44 S.Ct. 445, 446, 68 L.Ed. 898] (1924). Thus, when the police, who concededly had probable cause to do so, sought to arrest her, they merely intended to perform a function which we have approved in <em>Watson.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">427 U.S. at 42, 96 S.Ct. at 2409. Significantly, the Court went on to discuss Santana\u2019s retreat into her home. It justified the police entry into the home on the basis of \u201chot pursuit\u201d, pointing out that \u201cthere was ... a realistic expectation that any delay would result in destruction of evidence.\u201d <em>Id., </em>427 U.S. at 43, 96 S.Ct. at 2410. The Court then concluded that \u201ca suspect may not defeat an arrest which has been set in motion in a public place, and is therefore proper under <em>Watson, </em>by the expedient of escaping to a private place.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b486-6\"><em>Payton </em>and <em>Welsh </em>stand in stark contrast to <em>Santana. </em>In <em>Payton, </em>the Supreme Court reversed convictions in two companion cases in which the police entered private residences without a warrant, in one case, <em>Riddick v. New York, see </em>445 U.S. at 578, 100 S.Ct. at 1375, effecting an arrest of the accused. No exigent circumstances justifying the entry were present in either case, and, in both, there was ample time for the police to have obtained a warrant. Noting that \u201cthe warrantless arrest of a person is a species of seizure required by the [Fourth] Amendment to be reasonable\u201d and that \u201cphysical entry of the home is the chief evil against which the wording of the Fourth Amendment is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>directed\u201d, the Court held: \u201cit is a \u2018basic principle of Fourth Amendment Law\u2019 that searches and seizures inside a home without a warrant are presumptively unreasonable.\u201d <em>Id., </em>445 U.S. at 585, 586, 100 S.Ct. at 1379, 1380, quoting <em>United States v. United States District Court, </em>407 U.S. 297, 313, 92 S.Ct. 2125, 2134, 32 L.Ed.2d 752 (1972). The Court said that \u201cthe Fourth Amendment has drawn a firm line at the entrance to the house. Absent exigent circumstances, that threshold may not reasonably be crossed without a warrant.\u201d 445 U.S. at 590, 100 S.Ct. at 1382. <em>Payton, </em>therefore, patently establishes that the Fourth Amendment \u201cprohibits the police from making a warrantless and nonconsensual entry into a suspect\u2019s home in order to make a routine felony arrest.\u201d 445 U.S. at 576, 100 S.Ct. at 1375. <em>See United States v. McCool, </em>526 F.Supp. 1206, 1208 (M.D. Tenn.1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">The principles announced in <em>Payton </em>were applied and elucidated in <em>Welsh. </em>At issue there was the propriety of the accused\u2019s arrest for non-criminal traffic charges by officers who entered his home in the nighttime without a warrant. Acknowledging that the gravity of the offense for which the accused is arrested is an important factor in the determination of whether exigency exits, 466 U.S. at 753, 104 S.Ct. at 2099, the Court concluded that the arrest in that case was not justified by any exigency in light of the minor nature of the offense involved. 466 U.S. at 753-54, 104 S.Ct. at 2099-2100. In discussing the applicable principles, however, the Court made it clear that \u201c[bjefore agents of the government may invade the sanctity of the home, the burden is on the government to demonstrate exigent circumstances that overcome the presumption of unreasonableness that attaches to all warrantless home entries.\u201d 466 U.S. at 750, 104 S.Ct. at 2098. It stated explicitly that \u201cno exigency is created simply because there is probable cause to believe that a serious crime has been committed,\u201d 466 U.S. at 753, 104 S.Ct. at 2099, and, further, that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A78\">exceptions to the warrant requirement are \u201cfew in number and carefully delineated,\u201d <em>United States v. United </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number><em>States District Court, supra, </em>[407 U.S.], at 318 [92 S.Ct. at 2137], and that the police bear a heavy burden when attempting to demonstrate an urgent need that might justify warrantless searches or arrests. Indeed, the Court has recognized only a few such emergency conditions, <em>see, e.g., United States v. Santana, </em>427 U.S. 38, 42-43 [96 S.Ct. 2406, 2409-2410, 49 L.Ed.2d 300] (1976) (hot pursuit of a fleeing felon); <em>Warden v. Hayden, </em>387 U.S. 294, 298-299 [87 S.Ct. 1642, 1645-1646, 18 L.Ed.2d 782] (1967) (same); <em>Schmerber v. California, </em>384 U.S. 757, 770-771 [86 S.Ct. 1826, 1835-1836, 16 L.Ed.2d 908] (1966) (destruction of evidence); <em>Michigan v. Tyler, </em>436 U.S. 499, 509 [98 S.Ct. 1942, 1949, 56 L.Ed.2d 486] (1978) (ongoing fire), and has actually applied only the \u201chot pursuit\u201d doctrine to arrests in the home, <em>see Santana, supra.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b488-5\"><em>Id. </em>466 U.S. at 749, 104 S.Ct. at 2097.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-6\">As must readily be apparent, <em>Santana </em>is distinguishable from the case <em>sub judice </em>on several bases. First, Santana was <em>truly </em>voluntarily on the threshold of her home and exposed to public view when first observed by the police; appellant was not, his exposure to police view being procured by police action.<footnotemark>5a</footnotemark> Second, Santana\u2019s arrest was justifiable, as the court held, on the basis of hot pursuit, an exigent circumstance, <em>See Warden v. Hayden, </em>387 U.S. 294, 298-99, 87 S.Ct. 1642, 1645-46, 18 L.Ed.2d 782 (1967); <em>Dorman v. United States, </em>435 F.2d 385, 392-93 (1970); no such exigency existed here. It is interesting to note in this regard, that <em>Santana </em>was cited in <em>Welsh, </em>466 U.S. at 750, 104 S.Ct. at 2097, as one example of the \u201cfew ... emergency conditions\u201d recognized by the Supreme Court: \u201chot pursuit of a fleeing felon.\u201d Finally, and perhaps most important, because her arrest followed a series of rapidly unfolding events, the police had no opportunity to obtain a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>warrant to effect Santana\u2019s arrest. The circumstances immediately preceding the arrest demonstrate that this is so. After having given one Patricia McCafferty money with which to purchase heroin and having received heroin from McCafferty upon her return from Santana\u2019s house, the police arrested McCafferty, who told them that Santana had the money. Armed with that knowledge, the police drove to Santana\u2019s home where the events previously recounted occurred. In the instant case, the police had ample time to obtain an arrest warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">The latter two distinctions, which are closely interrelated, are particularly significant because they are also the critical distinctions between <em>Payton </em>and <em>Santana. </em>This point, without mentioning <em>Santana, </em>is forcefully and persuasively made by the <em>McCool </em>Court. <em>See </em>526 F.Supp. 1206. There, DEA agents, operating undercover, arrested one McCloud after he had sold them a quantity of qualudes. Shortly before the sale was consummated, McCool, who had come from a nearby apartment building, was observed at McCloud\u2019s car. After the sale and while in custody, McCloud informed the agents that his source was McCool. The agents discovered the apartment which McCool occupied and knocked on the door. When McCool opened the door, he was arrested. The Court, noting that the agents had probable cause for the arrest, held that the arrest was valid. It found <em>Payton </em>to be inapplicable because the arresting officers did not enter McCool\u2019s apartment. The Court went on to state, however:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-6\">Even though the <em>Payton </em>rule is inapplicable to this case because the arrest was accomplished without an entry, the Court cautions that <em>a different result might follow if the agents had had an opportunity to obtain a warrant for McCool\u2019s arrest before the events recounted above. Payton </em>expressly limited itself to cases involving \u201croutine arrests in which there was ample time to obtain a warrant,\u201d 445 U.S. at 583, 100 S.Ct. at 1378, a statement that clearly implies the possibility of different rules when arrests of particular individuals are not \u201cplanned.\u201d <em>See </em>2 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>W. LaFave, <em>[Search and Seizure </em>\u00a7 6.1 (c)] at 391-95 [1978]. In the Ninth Circuit\u2019s <em>Johnson </em>case<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> ... the court found an unlawful \u201cdoorway arrest\u201d on facts similar to those of the instant case, except that in <em>Johnson </em>the agents apparently could have obtained an arrest warrant before going to the defendant\u2019s home. The Court distinguished <em>United States v. Botero, supra, </em>589 F.2d [430] at 432-33 [(9th Cir.1978), <em>cert. denied, </em>441 U.S. 944, 99 S.Ct. 2162, 60 L.Ed.2d 1045 (1979)], on the grounds that <em>Botero </em>involved no subterfuge in getting the suspect to open the door. In <em>Botero, </em>the agents knocked and announced their presence, whereas in <em>Johnson </em>the agents identified themselves by ficticious names. <em>See </em>626 F.2d at 755. In this Court\u2019s opinion, that distinction is immaterial. The important distinction between <em>Johnson </em>and <em>Botero, </em>although the Ninth Circuit did not address it, is that in <em>Johnson, </em>the agents had \u201cample opportunity\u201d to obtain a warrant for Johnson before they went to his home, while in <em>Botero, </em>the arrest followed a series of rapidly unfolding events that led to the identification of a previously unknown suspect. Compare <em>United States v. Johnson, supra, </em>626 F.2d at 754-55, with <em>United States v. Botero, supra, </em>589 F.2d at 431.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-5\">If the facts had shown that Agent Tucker could have obtained a warrant for McCooI's arrest before this episode, the Court would be inclined to hold the arrest illegal under <em>Payton, </em>despite the absence of an entry. <em>To uphold warrantless arrests at a person\u2019s home whenever law enforcement officers successfully obtain his presence at a door too readily allows subversion of the Payton principle. See United States v. Johnson, supra, </em>626 F.2d at 757. In this Court\u2019s view, proper deference to <em>Payton </em>dictates that warrantless arrests effected even without entry in a suspect\u2019s home are generally illegal unless they are the unplanned results of field operations. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>Cf. <em>United States v. Blake, </em>632 F. [2d] 731, 734 (9th Cir.1980), (emphasizing that a warrant could have been obtained before arrest at suspect\u2019s home); 2 W. LaFave, <em>supra, </em>at 391-95. In most cases, this principle would allow doorway arrests only when an actual entry would have been justified under \u201chot pursuit\u201d exigent circumstances. <em>See </em>generally La Fave, <em>supra, </em>at 386-88. For example, in the instant case the hot pursuit exception would have allowed Agent Tucker to enter MeCool\u2019s apartment to make the arrest if McCool had not appeared at the door. <em>See United States v. Holland, </em>511 F.2d 38 (6th Cir.1975). But once McCool appeared at his door and submitted to arrest, a nonconsensual entry was unconstitutional____(footnote omitted) (emphasis supplied)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b491-5\"><em>Id., </em>526 F.Supp. at 1208-9.

In <em>Morse, </em>the police acting on probable cause that Morse had committed a rape, but without having obtained a warrant, went to Morse\u2019s motel room and knocked at the door. Morse, who was nude, answered the door and the police identified themselves, whereupon Morse said, \u201cI guess 1 know why you are here\u201d and tried to shut the door. This attempt was thwarted and the police entered the room.

In this case, however, any exigency arising from the defendant\u2019s retreat was created solely by the police action in knocking on the defendant\u2019s door.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">480 A.2d at 186. <em>See also State v. George, </em>210 Neb. 786, 317 N.W.2d 76, 79-81 (1982); <em>Morgan, </em>743 F.2d at 1166-67; <em>Johnson, </em>626 F.2d at 757; <em>McCool, </em>526 F.Supp. at 1209.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-6\">The fact that an accused may be exposed to police view when he opens the door in response to their knock does not in any manner vitiate the <em>Payton </em>rule. In <em>People v. Levan, supra, </em>the Court of Appeals of New York found illegal a warrantless arrest of the accused in his apartment even though the police entered the apartment only after the accused, who had opened the door in response to his neighbor\u2019s knock, was observed through the open door. The Court referred to <em>Riddick, </em>the companion case to <em>Payton, </em>in which a small child opened the door. It pointed out that the Supreme Court did not find the fact that Riddick had been seen through an open door before the arrest to be significant or, in any way, to justify the entry into Riddick\u2019s apartment. 476 N.Y.S.2d at 103, 464 N.E.2d at 471. <em>See also United States v. Johnson, </em>626 F.2d at 757. This analysis applies equally to the facts <em>sub </em>judice.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-7\">What we have said makes it obvious that, in reviewing the legality of a warrantless arrest effected in a private residence, the presence or absence of exigent circumstances, which necessarily involves an assessment of the opportunity of the police to have obtained a warrant prior to invading the residence to make the warrantless arrest, is a highly relevant factor to be considered by a reviewing court and, indeed, is critical, analytically, to that determination. <em>McCool, </em>526 F.Supp. at 1209. That appellant was arrested inside his apartment is beyond dispute; police testimony conceded that point. <em>See Johnson, </em>626 F.2d at 757 (\u201c[I]t is the location of the arrested person, and not the arresting agents, that determines whether an arrest occurs within a home.\u201d). Nor is the fact that the police <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>entered the apartment in effecting the arrest open to challenge, that fact having also been conceded in the police testimony. Moreover, there is absolutely no contention, nor could there be, that appellant consented to the police entry. When the chronology of the events surrounding appellant\u2019s arrest is considered in light of these concessions, it is clear that the police had ample time and opportunity to obtain a warrant; thus, appellant\u2019s arrest was not justified by any exigent circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-4\">By approximately 9:30 p.m. on November 11, the police had probable cause to arrest appellant for the Big Red gas station robbery, which had occurred some six days earlier. Shortly after 9:30 p.m., they went to appellant\u2019s apartment building for the express purpose of arresting appellant for that robbery. By 10:30 p.m., at least seven officers were \u201cpositioned around\u201d the building and between then and 11:30 p.m., when the arrest was made, the other residents of the building were evacuated from the building. Other than describing the police actions leading to appellant\u2019s arrest\u2014the development of probable cause and the preparations for the arrest\u2014the State offered only the testimony of Sgt. Collier as bearing on the exigency which might have justified the warrantless arrest. Incredibly, Sgt. Collier testified that, despite the presence of at least seven officers surrounding the house and the lapse of some two hours from the time probable cause was developed, he did not obtain a warrant because he \u201cdidn\u2019t have the time to do that and [because he] didn\u2019t have the manpower to do that.\u201d Patently, that testimony established neither exigent circumstances justifying a warrantless arrest, nor the absence of an opportunity for the police to have obtained a warrant. In any event, at oral argument, the State conceded that appellant\u2019s arrest could not be justified by exigent circumstances or a lack of opportunity to obtain a warrant since the facts disclosed the existence of neither.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">We hold that <em>Payton, </em>rather than <em>Santana, </em>controls the resolution of the issue before us. And because no exigent circumstances justified the warrantless entry into appel<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>lant\u2019s home, there being ample opportunity for the police to have obtained a warrant, we further hold that the police invaded appellant\u2019s home in order to make a routine felony arrest, rendering appellant\u2019s arrest illegal.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">In so holding, we are, to be sure, aware that courts across the country have had difficulty reconciling <em>Santana </em>and <em>Payton </em>with respect to warrantless doorway arrests and that some courts have held that the police may effect a warrantless arrest when an individual voluntarily opens his door in response to a police officer\u2019s knock. <em>E.g., People v. Schreiber, </em>104 Ill.App.3d 618, 60 Ill.Dec. 417, 421-22, 432 N.E.2d 1316, 1320-21 (1982), <em>cert. denied, </em>459 U.S. 1214, 103 S.Ct. 1214, 75 L.Ed.2d 452 (1983) (arrest of defendant at entrance of her room, after she voluntarily opened door in response to police officer\u2019s knock, held lawful where \u201cthere was no evidence to suggest that subterfuge was used or that defendant was in any manner coerced into opening the door and thus exposing herself to public view\u201d); <em>State v.

LaFave, <em>Search and Seizure </em>\u00a7 6.1(e), 587-595 (2d ed. 1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">These cases proceed on a false premise, one that fails to recognize or, at least, fails to acknowledge, the substantial distinctions between <em>Santana </em>and <em>Payton, </em>They focus myopically upon one factor\u2014an expectation of privacy<footnotemark>9</footnotemark>\u2014concomitantly, ignoring the warrant requirement as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>enunciated in <em>Payton, </em>and, thus, refusing to require compliance with its dictates. Moreover, adopting their reasoning would expand the warrant exception, which allows warrant-less arrests in private residences only if exigent circumstances exist, to include warrantless arrests in the absence of exigent circumstances, and would permit the exception, in that form, to swallow the rule. These cases are singularly unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">Having concluded that appellant was illegally arrested, it follows that the seizure of the sweatshirt by the police at the time of that arrest was the fruit of that illegality. <em>See In Re Owen F., </em>70 Md.App. 678, 688, 523 A.2d 627 (1987) (\u201c... [S]earches and seizures incident to an illegal arrest are necessarily unreasonable, <em>Stanley v. State, </em>230 Md. 188, 192, 186 A.2d 478 (1962), and no evidence secured from such a search and seizure may be introduced into evidence, <em>Mapp v. Ohio, </em>367 U.S. 643, 81 S.Ct. 1684, 6 L.Ed.2d 1081 (1961)____\u201d). Appellant\u2019s motion to suppress the sweatshirt should have been granted. The denial of the motion requires us to reverse appellant\u2019s convictions and remand the case to the circuit court for a new trial. In so holding, we, of course, reject the State\u2019s argument that the doctrine of inevitable discovery, <em>see Nix v. Williams, </em>467 U.S. 431, 104 S.Ct. 2501, 81 L.Ed.2d 377 (1984), renders the sweatshirt admissible. We agree with appellant that application of that doctrine to the facts <em>sub judice </em>\u201cwould ... read out of the Constitution the requirement that the police follow certain protective procedures, in this case, the warrant requirement of the Fourth Amendment [,]\u201d <em>Commonwealth v.

LaFave, <em>Search and Seizure, </em>\u00a7 11.4(a), 382 (2nd ed. 1987) in which the commentator states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b497-4\">Because one purpose of the exclusionary rule is to deter [unconstitutional] shortcuts, the \u201cinevitable discovery\u201d rule should be applied only when it is clear that \u201cthe police officers have not acted in bad faith to accelerate the discovery\u201d of the evidence in question. If the rule were applied when such a shortcut was intentionally taken, the effect would be to read out of the Fourth Amendment the requirement that other, more elaborate and protective procedures be followed, (footnote omitted)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">Since we have reversed appellant\u2019s convictions and ordered a new trial on the basis of the trial court\u2019s error in admitting the sweatshirt, we need not address appellant\u2019s arguments concerning the admissibility <em>vel non </em>of his statement; however, because the issue may arise on retrial, we offer the following observation. Our holding that the arrest was illegal does not automatically or even necessarily require suppression of appellant\u2019s statement. <em>See Brown v. Illinois, </em>422 U.S. 590, 603, 95 S.Ct. 2254, 2261, 45 L.Ed.2d 416 (1975); <em>Michigan v. Tucker, </em>417 U.S. 433, 449-50, 94 S.Ct. 2357, 2366-67, 41 L.Ed.2d 182 (1974); <em>Ryon v.

The facts in <em>Carrion </em>are very close to those in <em>McCool </em>and <em>Santana: </em>Carrion's co-defendant, who transported the narcotics for the transaction, was arrested shortly after the narcotics transaction had taken place.

Massey, could not arrest him without a warrant in the absence of exigent circumstances when the appellant voluntarily opened the door to his apartment in response to their knock. <em>United States v. Santana, </em>427 U.S. 38, 96 S.Ct. 2406, 49 L.Ed.2d 300 (1976) should control the disposition of this case rather <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>than <em>Payton v.

When an individual voluntarily opens the door in response to a knock, that expectation of privacy is relinquished. Under such circumstances, I would hold that the police may effect a warrantless arrest upon probable cause as is permitted in any public place. <em>United States v. Watson, </em>423 U.S. 411, 96 S.Ct. 820, 46 L.Ed.2d 598 (1976) (holding that a nonexigent warrantless arrest of an individual in a public place upon probable cause does not violate the Fourth Amendment).</p>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">In <em>Santana </em>the police had probable cause to believe that \u201cMom\u201d Santana had in her possession marked money that she had received in a sale of heroin. When the officers went to Santana\u2019s home, they saw her standing in the doorway of the house with a brown paper bag in her hand. After shouting \u201cpolice\u201d and displaying identification, the officers approached the house, but Santana retreated into the vestibule. The officers followed her through the open door, catching her in the vestibule, whereupon they seized two bundles of heroin that had fallen out of the paper bag and the marked money which had been in Santana\u2019s pockets. In reversing the decision of the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, which had upheld a district court\u2019s order granting Santana\u2019s motion to suppress that evidence, the Supreme Court concluded that Santana was in a \u201cpublic\u201d place when she stood in the open doorway of her house:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AL7\">While it may be true that under the common law of property the threshold of one\u2019s dwelling is \u201cprivate,\u201d as is the yard surrounding the house, it is nonetheless clear that under the cases interpreting the Fourth Amendment Santana was in a \u201cpublic\u201d place. She was not in an area where she had any expectation of privacy. \u201cWhat a person knowingly exposes to the public, even in his own house or office, is not a subject of Fourth Amendment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>protection.\u201d <em>Katz v. United States, </em>389 U.S. 347, 351 [88 S.Ct. 507, 511, 19 L.Ed.2d 576] (1967). <em>She was not merely visible to the public but was as exposed to public view, speech, hearing, and touch as if she had been standing completely outside her house. Hester v. United States, </em>265 U.S. 57, 59 [44 S.Ct. 445, 446, 68 L.Ed. 898] (1924). Thus, when the police, who concededly had probable cause to do so so, sought to arrest her, they merely intended to perform a function which we have approved in <em>Watson. </em>(Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b500-5\">427 U.S. at 42, 96 S.Ct. at 2409, 49 L.Ed.2d at 305. Because the arrest of Santana had been set in motion in a public place, the Court held that Santana\u2019s act of retreating into her house did not invalidate the otherwise proper arrest. <em>Id. </em>at 42-43, 96 S.Ct. at 2409-10, 49 L.Ed.2d at 305-06.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-6\">In terms of the Supreme Court\u2019s analysis in <em>Santana, </em>the appellant was in a \u201cpublic\u201d place after he voluntarily opened his door in response to a knock. Appellant certainly knew that he was exposing himself to the \u201cview, speech, hearing, and touch\u201d of whoever was at the door. Since the record does not reflect that he was aware of who was knocking at his door, there is no suggestion that he was intimidated into opening the door by the presence of police officers by anything they said or did.

State, </em>653 S.W.2d 305, 307 (Tex.Crim.App.1983) (appellants\u2019 act of opening door to police officer who had knocked on door, shouting \u201cPolice Officer,\u201d exhibited \u201cintentional relinquishment of any subjective expectation of privacy\u201d). Furthermore, the appellant does not assert that he was lured into opening the door through some ruse or deception on the part of the police. Compare <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>626 F.2d 753, 755-57 (9th Cir.1980), <em>aff'd on other grounds, </em>457 U.S. 537, 102 S.Ct. 2579, 73 L.Ed.2d 202 (1982) (defendant did not voluntarily expose himself to warrantless arrest by opening his door to federal agents who had misrepresented their identities). The mere fact that the police officers obtained the appellant\u2019s presence at the door by knocking on it did not render his act of opening the door involuntary, \u201cthere being no right of a citizen, constitutional or otherwise, which immunizes him from having a policeman knock on his door during reasonable evening hours.\u201d <em>Mullaney v. State, </em>5 Md.App. 248, 257, 246 A.2d 291 (1968), <em>cert. denied, </em>252 Md. 732 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b501-5\">The voluntary act of the appellant in the case <em>sub judice </em>in exposing himself to \u201cpublic view, speech, hearing, and touch\u201d is significant when measured against the factual predicates for the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Payton v. New York, supra. </em>The Court there was reviewing two warrantless entries into residences. In the first case police officers, possessing probable cause to arrest one Riddick for armed robbery, knocked on the door of Riddick\u2019s home. When Riddick\u2019s young son opened the door, the officers saw Riddick sitting in bed covered by a sheet. They entered the house and placed him under arrest. In the second case police officers, possessing probable cause to arrest one Payton for murder, proceeded to his apartment. When there was no response to their knock at the apartment door, they forcibly broke down the door and entered the apart<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>ment. In neither case before the Court in <em>Payton </em>had the arrestee voluntarily opened the door of his residence and exposed himself to \u201cpublic view, speech, hearing and touch.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">In testing the reasonableness of the seizure of the appellant\u2019s person without a warrant under the Fourth Amendment, the focus should be on his reasonable expectation of privacy at the site of the arrest. When he voluntarily placed himself in the open doorway of his home, he knowingly entered a public place where he was subject to a nonexigent warrantless arrest. <em>United States v.
