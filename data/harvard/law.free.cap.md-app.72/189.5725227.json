Section II of that policy contained provisions for the payment of personal injury protection (PIP) benefits, as required by Md.Code (1986 Repl. Vol.), Art. 48A, \u00a7 539(a). Ms. Huntt was an \u201cinsured\u201d as that term was defined in Section II of that policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-4\">As a result of the injuries she sustained, Ms. Huntt incurred expenses for medical treatment. She requested that State Farm reimburse her for those medical expenses under the PIP provisions of its policy. In support of that request, she supplied State Farm with copies of her medical reports and bills. State Farm reimbursed Ms. Huntt for her medical expenses until October 31, 1985, when it advised Ms. Huntt that it would not pay any further benefits unless she submitted to a medical examination by a physician selected by State Farm. State Farm\u2019s request that Ms. Huntt submit to a medical examination was made pursuant to paragraph 4(b) of the policy section applicable to PIP benefits entitled \u201cReporting a Claim-Insured\u2019s Duties.\u201d That provision allowed State Farm to require that a person making a claim \u201cbe examined by physicians chosen and paid by [State Farm] as often as [it] reasonably may require.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">Ms. Huntt continued to receive medical treatment after October 31, 1985 and to send State Farm her medical bills seeking reimbursement. She refused, however, to submit to a medical examination by a physician of State Farm\u2019s choice. Because of Ms. Huntt\u2019s refusal to be examined, State Farm continued to refuse her requests for reimbursement. On May 6, 1986, Ms. Huntt filed a three-count complaint against State Farm in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City. She sought damages in Count I for breach of contract and in Count II for \u201ctortious breach of duty of good faith and reasonable care.\u201d In Count III she requested a declaratory judgment concerning State Farm\u2019s obligations under the PIP provisions of its policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-6\">State Farm moved to dismiss Ms. Huntt\u2019s complaint pursuant to Rule 2-322 on the ground that it failed to state any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>claims upon which relief could be granted. After a hearing, Judge Thomas Ward granted State Farm\u2019s motion and entered judgment in its favor. Ms. Huntt appeals from that judgment, contending:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b220-4\">I. The Maryland PIP statute does not permit an insurer to require a beneficiary under the statute to submit to an examination by a physician chosen and paid by the insurer before the insurer\u2019s obligation to pay benefits required by the statute accrues.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b220-5\">II. An action may be maintained in the Maryland courts against an insurer by an insured for tortious breach of duty of good faith and reasonable care in the handling of a claim against the insurer by the insured.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">The appellant\u2019s argument that the PIP statute does not permit an insurer to require a beneficiary to submit to a physical examination is premised on the notion that such a requirement is somehow at odds with the \u201cremedial purpose\u201d of Maryland\u2019s no-fault automobile insurance legislation. The Court of Appeals recently reiterated that \u201c[t]he primary purpose of \u00a7 539 is \u2018to assure financial compensation to victims of motor vehicle accidents without regard to the fault of a named insured or other persons entitled to PIP benefits.\u2019\u201d <em>Tucker v. Fireman\u2019s Fund Ins. Co., </em>308 Md. 69, 75, 517 A.2d 730 (1986) (quoting <em>Pennsylvania Nat\u2019l Mut. Cas. Ins. Co. v. Gartelman, </em>288 Md. 151, 154, 416 A.2d 734 (1980)). In keeping with that \u201cclear remedial purpose, [citation omitted], a liberal construction of the statute is required.\u201d <em>Tucker v. Fireman\u2019s Fund Ins. Co., supra, </em>308 Md. at 77, 517 A.2d 730. This does not mean, however, that we should construe the statute so as to preclude an insurance company from enforcing a policy provision that is not in conflict with any statutory provision. <em>See DeJarnette v. Federal Kemper Ins. Co., </em>299 Md. 708, 725, 475 A.2d 454 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b220-7\">The statutory language requiring construction in this case is found in Md.Code, <em>supra, </em>Art. 48A, \u00a7 544(a), which provides in part: \u201cAll payments of benefits prescribed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>under \u00a7 539 shall be made periodically as the claims therefor arise and within 30 days after <em>satisfactory proof </em>thereof is received by the insurer____\u201d (Emphasis supplied). The appellant asserts that, by sending State Farm copies of her medical reports and bills, she satisfied the statutory requirement of \u201csatisfactory proof\u201d and that the State Farm policy provision imposing the additional condition of a physical examination is repugnant to that legislative standard and hence unenforceable. She attempts to distinguish between \u201creasonable medical proof,\u201d a term used in \u00a7 539(a) and again in \u00a7 544(a)(2), and \u201csatisfactory proof.\u201d Section 539(a) permits an insurer providing loss of income benefits to require, as a condition of receiving such benefits, \u201cthat the injured person furnish the insurer reasonable medical proof of his injury causing loss of income.\u201d Section 544(a)(2) permits an insurer to require \u201creasonable medical proof\u201d when an injured person who received benefits under the coverage(s) described in \u00a7 539 seeks additional benefits after a lapse in the period of disability or in medical treatment. In the appellant\u2019s view, these uses of \u201creasonable medical proof\u201d as the standard of proof in certain particularized situations reflect a legislative intention that \u201creasonable medical proof\u201d should be a higher standard than \u201csatisfactory proof.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">Whatever the distinction, if any, between \u201creasonable medical proof\u201d and \u201csatisfactory proof,\u201d we do not think it has a bearing on the resolution of this appeal. The only question we need to address is whether an insurer seeking \u201csatisfactory proof\u201d of a PIP claimant\u2019s request for benefits may require the claimant to undergo a physical examination by a physician selected and paid by the insurer.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">Section 544(a) mandates that \u201cpayments of benefits prescribed under \u00a7 539 shall be made ... within 30 days after satisfactory proof thereof is received by the insurer\u2014\u201d The benefits prescribed under \u00a7 539 include: \u201cpayment of all <em>reasonable </em>expenses arising from the accident and incurred within three years from the date thereof for <em>necessary </em>medical, surgical, x-ray and dental services, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>including prosthetic devices, and <em>necessary </em>ambulance, hospital, professional nursing and funeral services____\u201d (Emphasis supplied). While \u00a7 539 was enacted in order to assure prompt payment of PIP benefits without regard to fault, this does not mean that PIP coverage was intended to provide a PIP claimant with a blank check. Maryland\u2019s no-fault statute, like those of other states, places a control on inflated or spurious claims by limiting the insurer\u2019s obligation to payment of \u201creasonable\u201d expenses for \u201cnecessary\u201d services arising from the accident in question. 5 M. Minzer, et al., <em>Damages in Tort Actions </em>\u00a7 47.12[2][b] (1987). In our view, it would be impossible in many cases for an insurer to determine whether a PIP claimant\u2019s expenses were \u201creasonable\u201d and for \u201cnecessary\u201d services if the insurer could not require that the claimant be examined by a physician of its choice. Therefore, we hold that a policy provision permitting an insurer to require that a PIP claimant submit to a physical examination as a condition precedent to payment of benefits is consistent with the statutory mandate in \u00a7 544(a) that payment shall be made after the insurer receives \u201csatisfactory proof\u201d of the claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">The remedial purpose of the no-fault statute does not dictate that the State Farm policy provision be held unenforceable simply because that provision may cause some delay in the payment of PIP benefits.. When a policy provision is not in conflict with the statute, that provision will be enforced, the statute\u2019s underlying purpose notwithstanding. Thus, in <em>DeJarnette v. Federal Kemper Ins. Co., supra, </em>the Court of Appeals upheld a provision in an automobile liability policy excluding from PIP coverage persons injured while using a motorcycle. DeJarnette had been injured while riding a motorcycle as a passenger. He sought to recover PIP benefits under his father-in-law\u2019s automobile liability policy based on his status as a member of his father-in-law\u2019s household. The Court determined that \u00a7 545(b) made motorcycles subject to exclusion from PIP coverage and that \u00a7\u00a7 539 and 545, read together, indicated a legislative intention to allow motorcycle exclusions for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>any person covered under \u00a7 539, and not merely the named insured. <em>DeJarnette, supra, </em>299 Md. at 725, 475 A.2d 454. Accordingly, the policy exclusion in <em>DeJarnette </em>was held valid because it was not in conflict with the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-4\">In <em>Provident General Ins. Co. v. McBride, </em>69 Md.App. 497, 518 A.2d 468 (1986), <em>cert. denied, </em>309 Md. 326, 523 A.2d 1013 (1987), we considered whether an automobile liability policy properly excluded from uninsured motorist (UM) coverage an automobile owned by McBride, the named insured. Rejecting McBride\u2019s argument that the exclusion was invalid because the statute requiring UM coverage should be liberally construed in order to promote its purpose of assuring recovery to innocent victims of motor vehicle accidents, we pointed out that the policy exclusion at issue was specifically authorized by Art. 48A, \u00a7 541(c)(2)(i). 69 Md.App. at 507, 518 A.2d 468. Given the specific legislative authorization for such an exclusion, we declined \u201cto insert or delete words to ascertain a legislative intention different from [the statute\u2019s] clear meaning.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Although \u00a7 544(a) may not expressly authorize a policy provision such as that in the case <em>sub judice, </em>we think such a provision is contemplated by the statute\u2019s terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">The appellant also argues that requiring her to undergo a physical examination would place upon her the burden of litigating her claim if State Farm\u2019s examining physician was of the opinion that the expenses for which she sought reimbursement were unreasonable and/or that the treatment she received was unnecessary or not causally related to the accident in question. While that may be true, in order to make an informed decision as to whether a PIP claim should be paid, an insurer is entitled to the benefit of having a claimant examined by someone other than his or her own treating physician(s). Although disagreements between physicians as to the best course of treatment for a particular injury are not uncommon, we do not think the legislature intended that the opinion of the claimant\u2019s physician should be conclusive in every case. Nor do we think the legislature intended that insurance companies should be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>left unprotected against unreasonable PIP claims. Accordingly, we hold that the term \u201csatisfactory proof\u201d in \u00a7 544(a) encompasses the right of an insurance company to demand that a PIP claimant submit to a physical examination by a physician selected and paid by the insurer.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-4\">The appellant cites several cases from other jurisdictions in support of her argument that the medical bills and reports she submitted to State Farm should be considered satisfactory proof of entitlement to PIP benefits. In none of those cases, however, did the court address whether a medical examination provision was permitted by statute. In <em>Hart v. Allstate Ins. Co., </em>426 So.2d 711 (La.App.1982), <em>modified, </em>437 So.2d 823 (La.1983), the court found that the insured had submitted \u201csatisfactory proof of loss,\u201d as that term is used in a Louisiana statute governing uninsured motorist claims, by sending medical bills, medical reports and a medical authorization form to her insurer. 426 So.2d at 713-14. There was no discussion in either Louisiana appellate court\u2019s opinion, however, as to whether an insurer could require a claimant to submit to a medical examination as part of its investigation of the claim, since that was not at issue in the case. In <em>Kentucky Farm Bureau Mut. Ins. Co. v. Roberts, </em>603 S.W.2d 498 (Ky.App.1980), the court found that \u201creasonable proof of loss\u201d had been provided to the insurer on a claim for basic reparation benefits where the claimant forwarded copies of her attending physicians\u2019 bills and furnished the insurer with a completed medical authorization form. 603 S.W.2d at 499-500. Again, the issue before us was not presented to the Court in <em>Kentucky Farm </em>Bureau.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The courts in <em>Hagains v. Government </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number><em>Employees Ins. Co., </em>150 N.J.Super. 576, 376 A.2d 224 (1977), and <em>DiBassie v. American Standard Ins. Co. of Wisconsin, </em>8 Kan.App.2d 515, 661 P.2d 812 (1983), likewise did not consider whether an insurer may require an insured to submit to a medical examination as a condition precedent to payment of benefits. Indeed, both New Jersey and Kansas have specific statutory provisions authorizing insurers \u201cto include reasonable provisions\u201d in motor vehicle liability policies for mental and physical examination of those persons claiming personal injury protection benefits. Kan.Stat.Ann. \u00a7 40-3115(a) (1986); N.J.Stat.Ann. \u00a7 39:6A-13d. (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b225-4\">Where the issue has been presented, such policy provisions have been upheld. <em>Jensen v. American Family Mut. Ins. Co., </em>683 P.2d 1212 (Colo.App.1984); <em>Morris v. Aetna Life Ins. Co., </em>160 Ga.App. 484, 287 S.E.2d 388 (1981). In <em>Jensen </em>the plaintiffs, a husband and wife, brought suit against the defendant insurance company, alleging that the insurer \u201chad willfully and wantonly refused to pay\u201d PIP benefits for personal injuries sustained by the wife in two automobile accidents. 683 P.2d at 1213. On appeal from a jury verdict in favor of the insurer, they contended that a policy provision conditioning payment of benefits upon examination \u201cby physicians selected by the company, when and as often as the company may reasonably require,\u201d was an impermissible restriction on the coverage specified by Colorado\u2019s no-fault statute. The Colorado court disagreed and held that the provision at issue did not conflict with the basic purpose of the No-Fault Act, which is \u201cto avoid inadequate compensation to victims of automobile accidents.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">Similarly, the court in <em>Morris </em>concluded that a medical examination provision in an automobile liability policy did not violate Georgia\u2019s no-fault statute. The plaintiff there, an additional insured under his mother\u2019s policy, sued the defendant insurer for failure to pay PIP benefits allegedly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>due. On appeal from the trial court\u2019s entry of summary judgment for the insurer, he contended that because the statute authorizing PIP coverage did not expressly mention an insurer\u2019s right to request a medical examination in investigating such claims, the insurer had no right to require such an examination. Noting that such a conclusion by the court \u201cwould at least tend to ignore the possibility of the exercise of potential fraud,\u201d the Georgia appellate court rejected the appellant\u2019s argument, stating, \u201cIt hardly can be argued that an insurer cannot investigate what reasonably appears to be a questionable claim simply because the underlying statute authorizing the coverage does not mention such investigative rights.\u201d 287 S.E.2d at 390. Accordingly, the court held that the insurer\u2019s right to require a medical examination was neither a limitation on an insured\u2019s right to collect PIP benefits, nor a violation of public policy or of the Georgia no-fault statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-4\">In summary, we find nothing in Maryland\u2019s no-fault statute that would render unenforceable the State Farm policy provision at issue in this case. State Farm therefore had a contractual right to deny the appellant\u2019s claim for PIP benefits based on her failure to comply with the condition precedent that she submit to a medical examination by a physician of State Farm\u2019s choice. <em>Cf. Government Employees Ins. Co. v. Harvey, </em>278 Md. 548, 554, 366 A.2d 13 (1976). In view of our holding that the State Farm policy provision was valid and enforceable, the appellant's argument that State Farm breached a duty of good faith in handling her claim (i.e., Count II of her complaint) is rendered moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED;</p>\n<p id=\"b226-6\">COSTS TO BE PAID BY THE APPELLANT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b224-5\">. Even if the court in <em>Kentucky Farm Bureau </em>had addressed the issue that is before us, a contrary result would not have influenced our decision, since Kentucky, unlike Maryland, has created by statute a presumption that medical bills submitted in support of a claim for reparation benefits are reasonable. Ky.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 304.39-020(5)(a) (1981 Repl.Vol.). Kentucky also provides by statute that an insurer may petition a court to have an insured submit to a medical examina- . tion. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 304.39-270.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
