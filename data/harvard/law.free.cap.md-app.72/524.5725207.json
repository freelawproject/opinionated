He was examined on the record in open court pursuant to Md. Rule 4-242(c) in order to satisfy the court that his plea was voluntary and that he understood the nature of the charges and the consequences of his plea. Appellant, however, was never advised that if he is convicted of another \u201ccrime of violence\u201d in the future, the daytime housebreaking convictions would make him eligible for mandatory sentencing under Md.Ann.Code art. 27, \u00a7 643B (1986 Supp.). We granted leave to appeal to answer the question: \u201cWas Appellant properly advised of the consequences of his guilty plea?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b553-11\">Appellant contends that the possible use of the present convictions as predicate convictions for sentencing him under \u00a7 643B in the future is a \u201cconsequence\u201d of his guilty pleas that he must be made aware of under Md. Rule 4-242(c)(l) before the pleas can be accepted. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>Prior cases indicate that \u201cconsequences\u201d is not to be read as broadly as appellant reads it.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Thus, the defendant must be made aware of the maximum sentence he can receive when pleading guilty. <em>Bryant v. State, </em>47 Md.App. 551, 424 A.2d 1115 (1981). But he need not be told that his conviction could cause him to be deported in a separate civil proceeding; <em>Daley v. State, </em>61 Md.App. 486, 487 A.2d 320 (1985) (per curiam); that the judge may use sentencing guidelines, <em>Durbin v. State, </em>56 Md.App. 442, 468 A.2d 145 (1983); the nature of a suspended sentence with probation, <em>id.; </em>or that he may be referred to Patuxent Institution for a potentially indefinite (at that time) period, <em>Smith v. Director, </em>13 Md.App. 53, 280 A.2d 910 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b554-5\">In <em>Daley, supra, </em>this Court recognized the distinction drawn by other courts between direct and collateral consequences of a guilty plea. Courts generally hold that for the plea to be accepted, the defendant must be made aware of the former, but not the latter. A consequence is considered direct only if \u201cthe result represents a definite, immediate and largely automatic effect on the range of the defendant\u2019s punishment.\u201d <em>Daley, </em>61 Md.App. at 489, 487 A.2d at 322 (quoting <em>Cuthrell v. Director, Patuxent Institution, </em>475 F.2d 1364, 1366 (4th Cir., 1973)).</p>\n<p id=\"b554-6\">Section 643B can be invoked only for a crime which is committed <em>after </em>the predicate convictions. <em>Garrett v. State, </em>59 Md.App. 97, 112, 474 A.2d 931, 938 (1984). Thus, the convictions at issue could only be used as \u00a7 643B predicates against appellant if he were to commit a qualifying crime <em>after </em>he entered his guilty plea. This is not a definite, immediate, or largely automatic result of the plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>If appellant is convicted of a third qualifying crime in the future and sentenced under \u00a7 643B, the enhanced sentence will be for the third crime: it would not constitute a punishment for the predicate crimes at issue here. <em>Hawkins v. State, </em>302 Md. 143, 149, 486 A.2d 179, 182-83 (1985). Thus, the possibility of enhanced sentencing in the future is not part of the maximum sentence appellant could receive for the charges he pleaded guilty to in this case. <em>Cf. Bryant v. State, supra, </em>47 Md.App. 551, 424 A.2d 1115. Further, if the deportation of a resident alien based <em>solely </em>upon the conviction at issue in <em>Daley, supra, </em>is not a consequence within the meaning of Rule 4-242(c), then a fortiori the more tenuous risk of enhanced sentencing for a future crime is not.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-4\">We also note that the issue appellant raises is not entirely novel. In <em>Hawkins, supra, </em>defendant Hawkins had been convicted on two counts of daytime housebreaking in the late 1970\u2019s, when that offense was not listed as a qualifying offense under \u00a7 643B(a). Daytime housebreaking was added to the sentencing statute in 1982. Hawkins was then convicted of a third crime and the State sought to use the daytime housebreaking convictions to invoke \u00a7 643B. Hawkins objected to the use of an offense which was not listed in \u00a7 643B(a) at the time of the conviction. He correctly observed that this could lead a defendant to plead guilty to a crime without knowledge that it might later be used against him under the enhanced sentencing statute. Hawkins felt that this would render the plea unknowing or involuntary. <em>Hawkins, supra, </em>302 Md. at 149, 486 A.2d at 182. Nevertheless, the Court held that the prior convictions could be used as \u00a7 643B predicates even though a defendant could not have foreseen that possibility at the time of those convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\">Although the issue appellant raises here was not precisely before the Court in <em>Hawkins, </em>the Court was made aware of it through the defendant\u2019s argument in that case. <em>See </em>302 Md. at 147 and 149, 486 A.2d at 181 and 182. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>Court\u2019s opinion in that case leads us to believe that appellant\u2019s claim should be rejected in the case at bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-5\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-6\">COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLANT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b554-7\">. These prior cases were governed by former Rule 731c, from which Rule 4-242(c) is derived. For practical purposes, both rules used the same language: the court must determine that a guilty plea is made \"voluntarily, with understanding of the nature of the charge and the consequences of the plea.\u201d <em>See </em>Rule 4-242(c)(l) and <em>Bryant </em>v. <em>State, </em>47 Md.App. 551, 554, 424 A.2d 1115, 1117 (1981) (quoting former Rule 731c).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
