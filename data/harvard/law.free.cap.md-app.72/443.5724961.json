We disagree and affirm the judgment of that court.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-6\">Appellant and Eckel G., who married in April of 1985, have lived together for approximately 12 years. They are the parents of four children: Carlotta (date of birth\u2014September 23, 1976),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Christiana (date of birth\u2014February 17, 1978), James (date of birth\u2014July 18, 1979), and Kenneth (date of birth\u2014November 11, 1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b473-7\">On March 12, 1986, appellant left her marital home with her children when she learned that Carlotta had revealed at school that she had been sexually abused by Eckel G. She and the children were granted sanctuary at the Montgomery County Crisis Center when appellant reported to the Montgomery County Department of Social Services (DSS) that she feared reprisals by her husband against her and their children because of Carlotta\u2019s allegations against him. On March 13, 1986, while at the Crisis Center, appellant became severely depressed and threatened suicide. As a consequence, she was admitted to the psychiatric unit of Suburban Hospital. After a two week stay, the appellant left the hospital against medical advice.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-8\">On March 17, 1986, DSS filed petitions with the court alleging that the appellant\u2019s daughters and sons were children in need of assistance (CI\u00d1A) as defined in Md. Code (1984 Repl. Vol.,1986 Supp.), \u00a7 3-801(e) of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and requesting the court to order shelter care for the children pending an adjudicatory hearing on the petition. After a hearing the court commit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>ted the children to DSS for shelter care placement pursuant to \u00a7 3-815.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-4\">After an adjudicatory hearing on May 21, 1986, the court concluded that the children were CI\u00d1A. The court found from the evidence at that hearing that Carlotta had been sexually abused by her father since she was six years old. The court continued the children's commitment to DSS for shelter care pending disposition pursuant to \u00a7 3-820.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-5\">After a hearing conducted on July 14, 1986, the court made its dispositions. Foster care of all four children was continued, and the appellant and her husband were given reasonable visitation privileges under the supervision of DSS. At the request of the appellant, who had returned to live with her husband on June 4, 1986, the court reviewed the commitment of the children at hearings conducted on September 2, 1986 and November 5, 1986. When the court declined to modify the commitment, this appeal ensued.</p>\n<p id=\"AOy\">Section 3-820 provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-6\">(b) The priorities in making a disposition are the public safety and a program of treatment, training, and rehabilitation best suited to the physical, mental, and moral welfare of the child consistent with the public interest.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-7\">(c) (1) In making a disposition on a petition, the court may:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-8\">(i) Place the child on probation or under supervision in his own home or in the custody or under the guardianship of a relative or other fit person, upon terms the court deems appropriate;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-9\">(ii) Subject to the provisions of paragraph (2) of this subsection, commit the child to the custody or under the guardianship of the Juvenile Services Administration, a local department of social services, the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, or a public or licensed private agency on terms that the court considers appropriate to meet the priorities set forth in subsection (b) of this section, including designation of the type of facility where the child is to be accommodated, until custody or guardi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>anship is terminated with approval of the court or as required under \u00a7 3-825 of this subtitle; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-4\">(iii) Order the child, parents, guardian, or custodian of the child to participate in rehabilitative services that are in the best interest of the child and the family.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b475-5\">These options available to the judge in making a disposition must be considered <em>in pari materia </em>with the legislatively declared purpose of our juvenile code as set forth in \u00a7 3-802(a). <em>In re Jertrude O., </em>56 Md.App. 83, 97-99, 466 A.2d 885 (1983); <em>In re David K., </em>48 Md.App. 714, 720-21, 429 A.2d 313 (1981). That section states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-6\">(a) The purposes of this subtitle are:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-7\">(1) To provide for the care, protection, and wholesome mental and physical development of children coming within the provisions of this subtitle; and to provide for a program of treatment, training, and rehabilitation consistent with the child\u2019s best interests and the protection of the public interest;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-8\">(2) To remove from children committing delinquent acts the taint of criminality and the consequences of criminal behavior;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-9\">(3) To conserve and strengthen the child\u2019s family ties and to separate a child from his parents only when necessary for his welfare or in the interest of public safety;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-10\">(4) If necessary to remove a child from his home, to secure for him custody, care, and discipline as nearly as possible equivalent to that which should have been given by his parents;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-11\">(5) To provide judicial procedures for carrying out the provisions of this subtitle.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b475-12\">\u00a7 3-802(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b475-13\">Thus, the nature of the disposition is committed to the sound discretion of the court, <em>In re Johanna F., </em>284 Md. 643, 650, 399 A.2d 245 (1979); <em>In re Jessica M and Joseph M., </em>72 Md.App. 7, 527 A.2d 766, 768-69 (1987); but that discretion is limited where a child is removed from his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>or her parents. That option should be exercised only \u201cfor the most urgent reasons.\u201d <em>In re Jertrude O., supra, </em>56 Md.App. at 99, 466 A.2d 885. In the case <em>sub judice, </em>we hold that the court did not abuse its discretion in concluding that such reasons did exist.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">The environment within the marital home of appellant and Eckel G. posed a serious threat to the physical and emotional health of their children. Despite the ample evidence of Eckel G.\u2019s sexual abuse of Carlotta, he has denied any such conduct, and the appellant has supported him in that position. Indeed, appellant\u2019s mental illness was characterized by her treating psychiatrist as a personality disorder which centered around her abnormal dependency on her husband. This was further demonstrated by appellant's desire to continue living with Eckel G. even though he has physically abused her during the entire period of their relationship. Finally, evidence was adduced that Ann Sexton, the appellant\u2019s husband\u2019s paramour, who was also a distant member of the appellant\u2019s husband\u2019s family, lived in the home with the appellant and her husband. Ann Sexton\u2019s two children, fathered by Eckel G., also resided with the family and the appellant was often forced to care for these children although she resented their presence in the home. Some evidence was also presented that the appellant\u2019s children had witnessed their parents and Ann Sexton engaging in sexual activity, and that the children were aware that all three of the adults slept in the same bed.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-6\">The appellant was described as having no control over her children, and in fact the sole disciplinarian in the home was the appellant\u2019s husband. The discipline administered by the appellant\u2019s husband was described in the evaluation of the home environment prepared at the court\u2019s direction pursuant to \u00a7 3-818 as \u201cinconsistent and, more often than not, involve[d] physical abuse.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b476-7\">In summary, the documented misconduct of Eckel G. created a chaotic environment in appellant\u2019s marital home and posed a continuing threat to the mental and physical health of all of their children. Appellant\u2019s need to continue <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>her relationship with her husband in such an environment is sufficient to disqualify her as their custodian. <em>Cf.
