Before trial, the passenger, appellant Jason Hamm, moved to suppress the admission of the drugs as evidence. After oral argument, that motion was denied. The case was then tried upon an agreed statement of facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-11\">After presentation of the statement of facts, the Honorable Albert P. Close, Circuit Court for Harford County, found appellant, Jason Victor Hamm, quilty of possession with intent to distribute and sentenced him to five years imprisonment. A timely appeal was filed, and the following questions presented:</p>\n<p id=\"b206-12\">1. Did the trial court err in denying appellant\u2019s motion to suppress?</p>\n<p id=\"b207-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>2. Did the trial judge err in refusing to fully consider and in denying appellant\u2019s request to withdraw from his agreement to proceed by a not guilty statement of facts?</p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">I. <em>Motion to Suppress</em></p>\n<p id=\"b207-6\">Appellant contends that the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress cocaine seized from him. We disagree and explain as follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-7\">On December 11, 1985, Corporal Michael Joseph Cole stopped a 1986 Chrysler Fifth Avenue for speeding. The car was stopped at approximately 1:50 a.m. on 1-95, just south of the Susquehanna River Bridge. The car was being driven by Leslie Hamm. Her brother, Jason Hamm, was the only passenger in the automobile.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-8\">After the stop, Trooper Cole approached the car from the passenger side, startling Jason Hamm. While asking for the driver\u2019s license and the vehicle\u2019s registration, Cole noticed a large knife sitting on the dashboard. He then returned to his patrol car to examine the license and registration, that Leslie Hamm had given to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-9\">Leslie Hamm\u2019s driver\u2019s license had been issued by the State of California and listed a Los Angeles address. The car had been rented from Snappy Car Rental. The rental agreement, which was given to the officer in lieu of the registration, was in the name of Nadine Stansfield. After questioning, Jason Hamm revealed that the car had been rented to his girlfriend, but that \u201cshe was still back in Baltimore.\u201d Cole testified that this information, coupled with an examination of the rental contract, led him to believe that Leslie and Jason had unauthorized use of the automobile.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b208-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>When Trooper Cole returned to the stopped vehicle, the knife he had seen earlier was missing and a hat was put in its place. Concerned for his safety due to the unknown location of the knife, Cole asked Leslie and Jason Hamm to get out of the car.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Once out, the occupants were frisked <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>by Cole and then he searched the dash and under the seat of the car, looking for the knife. Cole discovered a gun and the knife under the hat. Jason and Leslie Hamm were then placed under arrest. A search was conducted incident to that arrest, during which cocaine and a large sum of money were discovered on appellant, Jason Hamm.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">Appellant contends that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-6\">Corporal Cole testified, albeit reluctantly, that he arrested Leslie Hamm for unauthorized use.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-7\">The trial judge did not rely on this basis for arrest. The reason is obvious: cross-examination of Cole and examination of the rental agreement demonstrated that there was no basis for an arrest for unauthorized use.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-8\">Instead, the trial judge relied on Cole having seen the knife. One problem is that for legally sufficient probable cause, \u201cIt is necessary that such belief abide in the seizing officer.\u201d <em>Dipasquale v. State, </em>43 Md.App. 574, 406 A.2d 665 (1979). In this case, Officer Cole specifically disclaimed any belief in probable [cause] to arrest \u201cfor a knife that could be something that anybody may carry.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-9\">A search of a vehicle may be conducted pursuant to a lawful custodial arrest of an occupant. <em>New York v. Belton, </em>453 U.S. 454, 461 [101 S.Ct. 2860, 2864] [69 L.Ed.2d 768] (1981). The prerequisite for a lawful custo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>dial arrest is probable cause to make the arrest. In this case, there was no probable cause and the fruits of the resulting search and seizure should have been suppressed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b210-4\">Appellant\u2019s contentions, however, are based on erroneous perceptions of both the law and the facts of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">Appellant and his sister were lawfully stopped for a routine traffic violation. During that stop, Trooper Cole noticed the knife and developed a suspicion that the driver had obtained unauthorized use of the car. Regardless of the legitimacy of his suspicion, Trooper Cole became concerned for his safety when he returned to the vehicle and found the knife missing. At that point, he asked the vehicle\u2019s occupants to get out of the car, whereupon he frisked them and searched the car for weapons.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-6\">The initial stopping of the car was justified as the driver had committed a misdemeanor, speeding, in the officer\u2019s presence. The second phase of detention, the stop and frisk of the vehicle\u2019s occupants, was justified under <em>Michigan v. Long, </em>468 U.S. 1032, 103 S.Ct. 3469, 77 L.Ed.2d 1201 (1981). In that case, the Supreme Court held that a police officer may make a protective search of both occupants and the passenger compartment of a car after a traffic stop, even when there is no probable cause, if the officer has a reasonable belief, based on specific and articulable facts, that the stopped person is dangerous and has or may gain immediate possession of weapons. <em>See also Pennsylvania v. Mimms, </em>434 U.S. 106, 111-12, 98 S.Ct. 330, 333-34, 54 L.Ed.2d 331 (1977) (police may order persons stopped for traffic violation out of their car and may frisk those persons for weapons if there is a reasonable belief that they are armed and dangerous).</p>\n<p id=\"b210-7\">Once the weapons were found, Trooper Cole had probable cause to arrest appellant for a weapons violation. <em>Adams v. Williams, </em>407 U.S. 143, 92 S.Ct. 1921, 32 L.Ed.2d 612 (1972). <em>Accord United States v. Hensley, </em>469 U.S. 221, 227, 105 S.Ct. 675, 680, 83 L.Ed.2d 604 (1985). A subse<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>quent, more extensive search was then justified as an incident to the arrest. <em>See New York v. Belton, </em>453 U.S. 454, 101 S.Ct. 2860, 69 L.Ed.2d 768 (1981); <em>Adams, supra. </em>Evidence found as a result of this more extensive search was, therefore, admissible. <em>Belton, supra; Adams, supra. See also Farrow v. State, </em>233 Md. 526, 527, 197 A.2d 434 (1964); <em>Payne v. State, </em>65 Md.App. 566, 573, 501 A.2d 484 (1985). <em>See generally </em>Annot., <em>Law Enforcement Officer\u2019s Authority, Under Federal Constitution, to \u201cStop and Frisk\u201d Person\u2014Supreme Court Cases, </em>32 L.Ed.2d 942 (1972). Thus, like the prior two tiers of appellant\u2019s detention, we think that the third tier\u2014the search incident to the arrest\u2014was reasonable and not in violation of the Fourth Amendment. <em>Adams, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b211-4\">In so deciding, we expressly reject appellant\u2019s contention that the evidence must be suppressed because there was no probable cause to arrest appellant for unauthorized use of the car, the charge Trooper Cole gave at the time of arrest. In <em>Boddie and Brooks v. State, </em>6 Md.App. 523, 252 A.2d 290 (1968), we defined what is meant by the term \u201cprobable cause.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b211-5\">Probable cause ... exists when the facts and circumstances within the knowledge of the arresting officer, or of which he had reasonably trustworthy information, are sufficient to warrant a reasonably cautious person in believing that a felony had been committed by the person arrested. <em>Michaels v. State, </em>2 Md.App. 424 [234 A.2d 772 (1967)]; <em>Gaudio v. State, </em>1 Md.App. 455 [230 A.2d 700 (1967)]. The rule of probable cause is a non-technical conception of a reasonable ground for belief of guilt, requiring less evidence for such belief than would justify conviction, but more evidence than that which would arouse a mere suspicion. <em>Edwardsen v. State, </em>243 Md. 131 [220 A.2d 547 (1966)]; <em>Terrell v. State, </em>3 Md.App. 340 [239 A.2d 128 (1968) ]. In other words, an officer is not required to have sufficient evidence to convict at the time of the arrest, but only probable cause or, as stated by the Supreme Court in <em>Spinelli v. United States, </em>393 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>U.S. 410 [89 S.Ct. 584, 21 L.Ed.2d 637 (1969) ], \u201conly the probability, and not a <em>prima facie </em>showing of criminal activity is the standard of probable cause.\u201d In <em>Davis v. United States, supra, </em>the District of Columbia Court of Appeals held at page 486 that <em>\u201cthe problem faced by the officer is one of probabilities\u2014not certainties and not necessarily eventual truth.\u201d </em>And it is settled that the legality of an arrest is measured by the existence of probable cause <em>at the time of the arrest. Mullaney v. State, </em>5 Md.App. 248 [246 A.2d (1968) ]; <em>Leatherberry v. State, </em>4 Md.App. 300 [242 A.2d 599 (1968)]; <em>Wilson v. State, </em>2 Md.App. 210 [233 A.2d 817 (1967) ]. In <em>Simms v. State, </em>4 Md.App. 160 [242 A.2d 185 (1968) ], we noted at page 167:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b212-5\">\u201cIn assessing the validity of an arrest under the rule <em>the essential ingredient is that probable cause existed within the knowledge of the arresting officer and not that he necessarily construed that knowledge correctly. </em>It is not the belief of the officer that determines the validity of the arrest; it is <em>whether, in the situation in which he found himself, he had probable cause to believe a felony had been committed and that the person arrested committed it.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b212-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 532, 252 A.2d 290 (emphasis added). Even assuming, <em>arguendo, </em>that the officer did not have probable cause to arrest for unauthorized use, he certainly had probable cause to arrest for the weapons violation. The arrest was, therefore, justified on that basis. For, \u201c[a]s to the <em>presence </em>of probable cause, if probable cause to arrest is apparently present, the fact that the information upon which the officer acted is subsequently determined to be false will not render the arrest illegal, nor does it matter that the arrest initially was made for the wrong offense.\u201d Cook, <em>Constitutional Rights of the Accused </em>at 106 (1972). <em>See also United States v. Lester, </em>647 F.2d 869, 873 (8th Cir.1981) (validity of search incident to an arrest does not turn upon suitability of stated grounds for arrest, instead \u201cthe validity of the arrest should be judged by whether the arresting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>officers actually had probable cause for the arrest, rather than by whether the officers gave the arrested person the right reason for the arrest\u201d); <em>State v. Retford, </em>276 S.C. 657, 281 S.E.2d 471, 472-3 (1981) (where officers clearly had probable cause to arrest appellant for auto theft, the fact that they stated the arrest was made for another offense did not render the arrest unlawful and, therefore, the fruit of the search incident to the arrest was properly admitted into evidence); <em>State v. Robinson, </em>622 S.W.2d 62, 68 (Tenn.Cr.App.1980) (although defendant is entitled to be informed of the cause for his arrest, \u201can arrest is not rendered unlawful by the fact that an officer who has authority to make an arrest for a particular offense erroneously states he is making an arrest for some other offense, or even for a cause which is not in fact an arrest, or states the offense inaccurately.\u201d). <em>See </em>generally LaFave, 1 <em>Search and Seizure </em>\u00a7 1.4(d)(2d ed. 1987) (exclusion based on officer\u2019s mistaken grounds for arrest is \u201cunjustified ... because such situations are often attributable to complicated legal distinctions between offenses or an officer\u2019s failure to record all the bases or the strongest basis upon which the arrest was made\u201d). Accordingly, we hold that the trial court did not err in denying appellant\u2019s motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-4\">II. Request to Withdraw From Agreement to Plead Not Guilty and Proceed on an Agreed Statement of Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b213-5\">Appellant contends that the trial court erred in denying his request to withdraw from his agreement to proceed by a not guilty statement of facts<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and allow him to go to trial. Specifically, appellant alleges that the agreement was not made voluntarily, but was coerced by his attorney. Further, he argues \u201cthat Appellant acted to waive substan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>tial constitutional rights not as a matter of free will, but out of a threat to his sister.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b214-5\">The \u201cagreement,\u201d which the trial court referred to as \u201ca plea bargain,\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> was recited for the record at trial by the prosecutor:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b214-6\">The plea arrangement in this case is as follows: As to Jason Hamm, the plea bargain on the agreed statement of facts would be to Possession with Intent to Distribute Cocaine; that the State would be seeking five years incarceration to the Division of Correction; that the State would stet the other remaining counts in the Jason Hamm indictment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b214-7\">The State will not pursue the subsequent offender section with respect to Mr. Hamm. When a PSI is completed and at the time of sentencing, if the Court sees fit to incarcerate Mr. Hamm for more than five years, then Mr. Hamm will have the option to withdraw his plea at that time, if he so desires.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b214-8\">With respect to Leslie Hamm, the plea would be to Possession of Cocaine. The State would oppose a 292, but would give the defense the opportunity to ... obviously the right to argue that to the Court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b214-9\">The State, after the Court has an opportunity to review the PSI, will suggest to the Court no jail time with respect to Leslie.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b214-10\">And if the Court for some reason sees fit to incarcerate her, after reviewing the PSI, then she will have the right to withdraw her plea.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b214-11\">Also, as a side agreement to the arrangement that I just put on the record, it is my understanding that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>issues with respect to the suppression hearing that were previously heard by the Court on 4/15/86 and all of the exhibits pertaining to that suppression hearing, will be preserved in that the defense attorney will take an appeal on the suppression issue only, to the Special\u2014the Court of Special Appeals.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">While the appellant and his trial counsel acknowledged the \u201cagreement\u201d at trial, appellant, at sentencing, sought \u201cto withdraw from the plea negotiations\u201d because he \u201c... was coerced into it ... by [his] attorney.\u201d To this the learned trial judge advised the appellant that he could seek postconviction relief. Appellant now characterizes that advice as \u201can obvious refusal to exercise discretion\u201d and incongruously couples it with the contention that his waiver of substantial constitutional rights was involuntary. There is no merit to appellant\u2019s arguments. Even if the appellant\u2019s plea were viewed as a guilty plea or its functional equivalent,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> the record is clear that prior to trial, the court had gone to painstaking efforts to be sure that appellant\u2019s agreement was voluntary and that he understood both the charges against him and the consequences of the agreement. The relevant colloquy was as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-6\">THE COURT: All right. Mr. Hamm, do you*understand the charges against you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-7\">MR. HAMM: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-8\">THE COURT: The Court advises you that you have a right to be tried either by a Judge or by a jury. Whether you are tried by a Judge or jury you must be found guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. In a jury trial, all twelve jurors must agree that you are guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. In a trial before a Judge, the Judge makes that determination.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-9\">How do you wish to be tried, by a Judge or by a jury?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>MR. HAMM: By a Judge.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-5\">THE COURT: In giving this answer, is it your intention to give up your constitutional right to a trial by jury?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A7Z\">MR. HAMM: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-6\">THE COURT: Are you doing this knowingly and voluntarily?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-7\">MR. HAMM: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-8\">THE COURT: And what is your plea?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-9\">MR. BIRT: The plea is Not Guilty.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-10\">THE COURT: Again going on an agreed statement of facts?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-11\">MR. BIRT: Yes, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-12\">THE COURT: Would you now advise the Defendants as to what an agreed statement of facts is?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-13\">MR. BIRT: Leslie and Jason Hamm, when the Court proceeds on an agreed statement of facts it means that the State\u2019s Attorney will read into the record a statement of facts that he believes he would be able to prove if the case would go to trial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-14\">This is done in lieu of an actual trial. That means that there would be no witnesses that will take the stand. There will*be no opportunity to cross examine the witnesses.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-15\">By proceeding on this basis, you are waiving certain of your trial rights. You are waiving your right to produce evidence, your right to confront the witnesses against you, your right to cross examination of these witnesses. In fact, you are waiving all of your trial rights except for the right to move for judgment of acquittal at the end of the presentation of the statement of facts.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-16\">And as you know, the facts as read into the record will most probably be likely sufficient to prove you guilty of the charges.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-17\">Do you understand that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-18\">MR. HAMM: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-19\">MISS HAMM: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b217-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>THE COURT: Do you understand that you are giving up also your right to testify in your own behalf and so forth; both of you understand that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b217-4\">MR. HAMM: Uh-huh.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b217-5\">MISS HAMM: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b217-6\">THE COURT: And you are willing to go on this basis? MISS HAMM: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b217-7\">MR. HAMM: Yes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b217-8\">The court below did not err in refusing appellant\u2019s request for a second trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-9\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED; APPELLANT TO PAY THE COSTS.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b207-10\">. On the motion, Officer Cole testified as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b207-11\">A. After scanning over the rental contract, I picked up on it what I believed to be a violation of the contract. And I called on the police radio for Trooper Parris to stop by my location as back up. While I was waiting for him ... he wasn\u2019t in the immediate area ... I <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>finished writing my warning for speed and reviewing the contract in full.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-6\">Q. What was the problem with the contractual agreement?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-7\">A. It didn\u2019t ... by the waivers, the insurance waivers that the renter did not option for, then by the contract it did not allow anyone other than the renter to operate the car; which is kind of a common fault that we find on stopping rental cars.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-8\">Q. So that I understand you correctly, the contractual agreement only provided for the renter to be driving the car, is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ayr\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-9\">Q. (By Mr. Comen) Could you determine that by looking at the contract?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-10\">A. Most contracts ... Like I said, the contract was for a Nadine Standfield. And the only occupants in the car was Jason and Leslie Hamm. And most contracts, in my experience with them, like I said, a lot of them will have an actual additional block on the contract for additional drivers. So if you wanted to have a couple ... say you and I were renting a car together and I wanted to have you legally be able to drive it too, you would be present at the counter at the time of the rental, and your name could be added onto it as authorized drivers permitted by the company. But this particular contract did not have any additional drivers listed on the contract, other than the renter.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b208-11\">.
