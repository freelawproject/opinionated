BRYAN, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"Agj\">Removed from office as a Hearing Examiner for the Social Security Administration by order of the Civil Service Commission, appellant Clement L. McEaehem sought review and vacation of the order in the District Court. His suit was dismissed there on the ground that the court had \u201cno jurisdiction to review the decision of the Civil Service Commission.\u201d The Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001 et seq., we hold, governs the appointment and removal of such examiners and empowers the District Court to set aside the order for cause. We simply find jurisdiction; we intimate nothing as to the validity of the order.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-17\">Appointment of examiners is provided in \u00a7 11 of the Act 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1010, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-18\">\n<em>\u201cAppointment of examiners; assignment, removal and compensation; jurisdiction of Civil Service Commission</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-19\">\u201cSubject to the civil-service and other laws to the extent not inconsistent with this chapter, there shall be appointed by and for each agency as many qualified and competent examiners as may be necessary for proceedings pursuant to sections 1006 and 1007 of this title, who shall be assigned to cases in- rotation so far as practicable and shall perform no duties inconsistent with their duties and responsibilities as examiners. Examiners shall be removable by the agency in which they are employed only for good cause established and determined by the Civil Service Commission * * * after opportunity for hearing and upon the record thereof. * * * \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b81-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>McEachern was duly appointed under this provision as hearing examiner on July 25, 1958. The Social Security Administration on October 20, 1961 requested the Commission to ascertain if there was good cause for his discharge. Social Security complained of his failure to meet his financial obligations, specifying eight instances. A full hearing before a presiding officer of the Civil Service Commission followed, both McEach-ern and Social Security appearing with counsel. McEachern\u2019s derelictions constituted, according to the \u201cStatement of Charges and Specifications\u201d, a violation of the policy of the Department of Health, Education and Welfare in that they brought discredit on the Office of Hearings and Appeals, the Social Security Administration and HEW.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\">Upon the evidence the presiding officer sustained four, and dismissed four, of the charges. McEachern\u2019s discharge was recommended. The Commission, after hearing and study of the record, found \u201cgood cause\u201d established for the dismissal, and so ordered. The defendant named in the complaint here is the United States of America. The prayer to the court was to \u201creview and reverse\u201d the determination of the Civil Service Commission and to \u201creinstate\u201d McEach-ern ; the predicate of the complaint was that the Commission was without substantial evidence warranting its decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-6\">In dismissing, the District Judge believed that the removal of an administrative officer was exclusively the province of the Executive Department \u2014 that the court could only look to see if the plaintiff had been relieved of his position in violation of statute or without the benefit of safeguarding procedures. Certainly this is true generally. E. g., Keim v. United States, 177 U.S. 290, 20 S.Ct. 574, 44 L.Ed. 774 (1900); Hargett v. Summerfield, 100 U.S.App.D.C. 85, 243 F.2d 29, cert. denied, 353 U.S. 970, 77 S.Ct. 1060, 1 L.Ed.2d 1137 (1957); Carter v. Forrestal, 85 U.S.App.D.C. 53, 175 F.2d 364 (D.C.Cir.), cert. denied, 338 U.S. 832, 70 S.Ct. 47, 94 L.Ed. 507 (1949). Indeed, it is recognized in the Administrative Procedure Act, particularly in \u00a7 5 dealing with review of agency adjudications. There \u201cthe selection or tenure of an officer or employee of the United States\u201d is exempted from the Act. However, in the same clause is an exception of \u201cexaminers appointed pursuant to \u00a7 1010 of this title\u201d [\u00a7 5 of the Act], thus restoring the reviewability of \u201cthe selection or tenure\u201d of an examiner named under the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-9\"> This review may be obtained by the aggrieved person in the form of the complaint McEachern filed in the District Court. \u00a7 10(b) of the Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1009(b). Thereon the Court \u201cshall decide all relevant questions of law, * * * and determine the meaning or applicability of the terms of any agency action\u201d. \u00a7 10(e), 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1009(e). The Civil Service Commission is obviously an \u201cagency\u201d for, as we have already noted, the Act covers examiners removable by the Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-10\">Venue of the action, since the amendment of October 5, 1962, to \u00a7 1391 (e), Title 28 U.S.Code, may be laid, as is the present suit, in the district of the plaintiff\u2019s residence. Moreover, by the same amendment the officers of the United States or its agency may be sued there.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-11\">Hence, dismissal of the suit for want of jurisdiction was in error; but in result the ruling was correct, for the United States was not the suable party. The only possibly proper defendants, as the Government concedes, were the members of the Civil Service Commission and the Commissioner of Social Security. In the circumstances we will set aside the order of dismissal and remand the action to the District Court with directions to drop the United States as a party defendant, allow the plaintiff to amend so as to implead proper defendants, and thereafter grant the plaintiff a hearing on the complaint in accordance with the provisions of \u00a7 10(e) of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1009(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b81-12\">Affirmed in part; vacated in part; and remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
