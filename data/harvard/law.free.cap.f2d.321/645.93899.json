El Paso Natural Gas Co. v. Kelly, et al., 308 F.2d 820. It is contended that the judgment does not conform to the opinion and mandate.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-22\">\u201cUpon remand from an appellate court with a specific mandate the trial court is limited to the imperative of the mandate and is without jurisdiction to vary or extend it.\u201d Britton v. Dowell, Inc., 10 Cir., 243 F.2d 434. See also, Bastian v. Erickson, 10 Cir., 114 F.2d 338. In the former opinion we held that the plaintiffs had acquired 660 mineral acres on a weighted acreage basis which was alloted to them from three separate tracts in proportion to the ownership of their grantor in these tracts. To obtain this result a method of calculation was set forth. The judgment entered on the mandate is in accord with that method.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-23\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
