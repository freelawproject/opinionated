Cockrell (hereinafter called petition<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>er) as \u201ctraveling expense * * * while away from home' \u201d under Section 162(a) (2), I.R.C.1954 (26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 162(a) (2)). The facts relating to that question are not in dispute \u2014 they are set forth at length in the Tax Court\u2019s opinion reported at 38 T.C. 470. Consequently we only state background facts sufficient to pinpoint the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">Petitioner is employed by McDonnell Aircraft Corporation (hereinafter referred to as McDonnell) as a data engineer in its engineering and test division and has been so employed from 1954 until the present time. McDonnell is engaged in the research, development, and production of airplanes, missiles and spacecraft. Over ninety-nine per cent of its business is from defense work under Government \u2022contracts. Through its engineering division it conducts research, designs, and produces prototype of craft and missiles at its plant in St. Louis. The engineering division is required to then test these articles at various Air Force bases, such as Holloman Air Force Base, Alamogordo, New Mexico.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-6\">In 1955 and 1956, McDonnell entered into separate contracts with the United States Air Force to conduct research and develop a missile known as the GAM-72 and to participate in the research and development of an airplane known as the F-101. Both contracts called for the testing of those aircraft to be conducted at Holloman; and provided among other things that the Government would reimburse McDonnell for cost of travel and per diem living expenses incurred by its employees in their relocation at Alamogordo, New Mexico. During the years 1956 through 1960, McDonnell scheduled and carried out experimental tests on \u201cboth such projects at Holloman. At one time it had over three hundred of its \u2022employees working at Holloman.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-7\">By means of formulated \u201cTravel and Relocation Authority\u201d executed pursuant to its contract with the Government, McDonnell, on May 25, 1956, assigned petitioner to duty at Holloman, as data engineer in charge of the Delta Project testing. The provisions of such formulated authority are set forth in the opinion of the Tax Court. Suffice to say, during the calendar years here in question, while petitioner was assigned and relocated at Holloman, he received $10.00 per diem ($70.00 per week) as living expense for the entire time he lived at Alamogordo, without restriction being placed thereon by McDonnell as to use of the amount of such payments. Petitioner worked on the Delta Project at Holloman until July 1, 1957. He was then assigned to work on the GAM-72 Project which was beginning at Holloman at that time. The Delta Project test had not been completed when petitioner was assigned to the GAM-72 Project. He remained with the latter project until it was near completion in November 1960. Hence he worked continuously at Holloman, from May 31,1956 through November 28,1960, with the exception of a short period in December 1957, when he returned to McDonnell\u2019s plant in St. Louis for three days and thereafter took a week\u2019s vacation, not returning to Holloman until January 3 or 4,1958.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-10\">When first assigned to Llolloman, petitioner elected to take his wife and child with him. Consequently, he ceased to rent an apartment in St. Louis. He and his family drove to Holloman in his automobile, where they lived in motels for approximately two months in and around Alamogordo, New Mexico. McDonnell made a special allowance to petitioner for the two months he and his family lived in such motels. Subsequently, petitioner rented a 2-bedroom house in Alamogordo on a month-to-month basis where he and his family lived until July 1959. In 1958 a second child was born to petitioner and his wife. In July 1959 petitioner and his family rented and moved into a different house in Alamogordo which he also rented on a monthly basis. Petitioner and his family lived in that house through November 1960.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-11\">When petitioner first left St. Louis he knew he was being assigned to Holloman on the Delta Project and would also work on the F-101 tests before returning to McDonnell\u2019s plant in St. Louis. He then <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>knew that the testing time as to both such projects was \u201cuncertain * * * because they were research development, and experimentation\u201d and the length of time it would take to complete such testing was \u201cindefinite\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-5\">In their 1957 income tax returns petitioner designated \u201cOut-of-town Travel Expenses\u201d amounting to $3,470.00 which was deducted as \u201cTravel, reimbursed expenses, etc.\u201d with an attached explanation stating that \u201cThis amount was expended for transportation, meals, and lodging while traveling away from home in connection with my employer\u2019s business for the period 1-5-57 to 11-2-57.\u201d On their 1958 income tax return petitioner did not include any amount received from McDonnell as per diem allowance, but in answer to the question, \u201cDid you receive an expense allowance or reimbursement, or charge expenses to your employer?\u201d checked the box opposite \u201cYes\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-6\">Respondent in his notice of deficiency increased petitioner\u2019s income in each of the years 1957 and 1958 by the amount of $3,470.00, entiting it \u201cAdditionaj Compensation\u201d * * * under Section 61(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954; and stated \u201cthat this amount is not deductible as expenses of travel while away from home under Section 162(a) (2) of the Code, and that the expenditure of such amount represents non-deductible personal living expenses.\u201d The Tax Court sustained respondent\u2019s determination. It is from that decision that petitioner prosecutes this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-8\">Since respondent concedes that if the expenditures here considered were incurred by petitioner while he was \u201caway from home\u201d within the meaning of Section 162(a) (2) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, supra, they would be deductible as traveling expense, we are only concerned with a mixed question of law and fact as to whether the conclusion of the Tax Court * * * that the per diem expense here considered was \u201cadditional compensation\u201d under Section 61(a) of the Code, and not deductible as \u201ctraveling expense\u201d in a tax sense of being \u201caway from home\u201d under 162(a) (2), supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-11\">It is petitioner\u2019s contention that a determination of his right to a deduction, as here claimed should be resolved by considering his assignment to Holloman Air Force Base to be for a \u201ctemporary\u201d period within the context of his employment relationship with McDonnell; and not. from the standpoint that when his assignment was made it effected a change in his-tax home situs, as respondent and the Tax Court ruled. His argument is this: He-is a career employee of McDonnell; his principal post of employment is at the-only permanent plant owned by McDonnell, in St. Louis, Missouri; one of the-requisites of his employment was his: availability for travel when he was hired ;\u2022 his personal skills and experience were required at Holloman because of the exigencies of McDonnell\u2019s business; when he gave up his residence in St. Louis to-go to Holloman, he says, his \u201chome ties-remained\u201d in St. Louis and although he- and his family lived continuously at. Alamogordo, New Mexico, for approximately four and one-half years, he never did \u201cabandon his intention of returning-to (his) permanent home plant\u201d job.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-12\">Petitioner cites no authority (case law,, rule or regulation) applicable to the contention he here makes. Seemingly, the-reason therefor is his contention that, \u201cthe instant case is (factually) distinguished from all other (previously adjudicated) cases.\u201d From that and other-statements made one may assume that petitioner wholly relies on the logic of argument to support the position he here-assumes. Because in tax law \u201cthe logic-of words (must) yield to the logic of' realities\u201d Di Santo v. Pennsylvania, 273 U.S. 34, 43, 47 S.Ct. 267, 270, 71 L.Ed. 524 (dis. op.), we do not follow petitioner in his argument. It is axiomatic that \u201cExceptions from taxation cannot rest upon mere implications\u201d i. e. logic. Cf. United States v. Stewart, 311 U.S. 60, 71, 61 S.Ct. 102, 109, 85 L.Ed. 40 (1940). The income tax on personal income is of necessity \u201cdescribed in sweeping terms. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>\u2022and should be broadly construed in accordance with an obvious purpose to tax income comprehensively. The exemptions (therefrom) are specifically stated and should be construed with restraint in the light of the same policy.\u201d Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Jacobson, 336 U.S. 28, 49, 69 S.Ct. 358, 369, 93 L.Ed. 477 (1948).</p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\">The issue in the case at bar turns upon a narrow question of fact and application of the three tests stated in Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Flowers, 326 U.S. 465, 66 S.Ct. 250, 90 L.Ed. 203 (1945). The exigencies of McDonnell\u2019s overall operation which petitioner argues necessitated his relocation at Holloman, standing alone, is of no significance to petitioner\u2019s right to claim personal \u201cliving expense\u201d as a tax deduction in the sense of \u201ctraveling expense\u201d while living at Almogordo, New Mexico, close to Holloman. Section 162(a) (2), supra, refers to \u201ctraveling expense\u201d while \u201caway from home.\u201d The word \u201chome\u201d as used in that section is to be given its ordinary meaning. In a tax sense it is referable to the place where one has his principal place of duty, and where he has an abode while pursuing such duty;\u2014 not where he merely claims his \u201cresidence\u201d to be. (Wright v. Hartsell, 305 F.2d 221 (9 Cir. 1962), and cases therein cited.) Ney v. United States, 171 F.2d 449 (8 Cir. 1948), cert. den. 336 U.S. 967, 69 S.Ct. 940, 93 L.Ed. 1119; Bercaw v. Commissioner, 165 F.2d 521 (4 Cir. 1948); Barnhill v. Commissioner, 148 F.2d 913, 159 A.L.R. 1210 (4 Cir. 1945). \u201cThe job, not the taxpayer\u2019s pattern of living,\u201d is the crucial matter. Carragan v. Commissioner, 197 F.2d 246, 249 (2 Cir. 1952); O\u2019Toole v. Commissioner, 243 F.2d 302, 303 (2 Cir. 1957).</p>\n<p id=\"b555-6\">We think the test is this: \u201cWhere it appears probable that a taxpayer\u2019s \u2022employment outside the area of his regular abode will be for a \u2018temporary\u2019 or \u2018short\u2019 period of time, then his travel expenses are held to be deductible; conversely, if the prospects are that his work will continue for an \u2018indefinite\u2019 or \u2018intermediate\u2019 or \u2018substantially long\u2019 period, then the deduction is disallowed.\u201d Wright v. Hartsell, supra, 305 F.2d 1. c. 224. The fundamental question is whether one is in a traveling status as defined in Peurifoy v. Commissioner, 358 U.S. 59, 79 S.Ct. 104, 3 L.Ed.2d 30 (1958), or whether the particular taxpayer has moved his home nearer to the place where he is working. Cf. Wright v. Hartsell, supra, 305 F.2d 1. c. 224; Harvey v. Commissioner, 283 F.2d 491 (9 Cir. 1960); Green v. Commissioner, 298 F.2d 890 (6 Cir. 1962); Ford v. Commissioner, 227 F.2d 297 (4 Cir. 1955); Andrews v. Commissioner, 179 F.2d 502 (4 Cir. 1950); Ney v. United States, supra; York v. Commissioner, 82 U.S.App.D.C. 63, 160 F.2d 385 (D.C.Cir.1947). There is ample evidence in the record of this case to sustain the Tax Court\u2019s conclusion that the per diem allowance paid to petitioner was a \u201cLiving Allowance\u201d, therefore \u201cadditional compensation under Section 61(a) (2) of the Code,\u201d and not \u201cTraveling Expense\u201d within the ambit of Section 162(a) (2), supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-8\">There is no warrant in the Code for allowing a deduction for \u201cLiving Allowance\u201d made to an employee when he is \u201crelocated\u201d at a place where the needs of his employer\u2019s business compel him to go in the prosecution of his job or occupation and he takes his family with him and abides with them at his relocated post for an \u201cindefinite\u201d \u2014 long period of time, as here. Reimbursement for increased cost of living under such circumstances is not a deductible item-under Section 162(a) (2), supra. Cf. Courtney v. Commissioner, 32 T.C. 334. The petitioner here recognizes the distinction between \u201cindefinite\u201d and \u201ctemporary\u201d employment as considered by the Supreme Court in Peurifoy v. Commissioner, supra. His contention that his \u201cindeterminate\u201d relocation at Holloman was temporary in relation to McDonnell\u2019s overall business operations is not within such concept.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-9\">The decision of the Tax Court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
