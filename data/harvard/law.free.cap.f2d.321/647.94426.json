Conviction exposes a defendant who \u201ccommits, or conspires to commit\u201d such offenses, to at least five years and not more than twenty years incarceration and a fine. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7237(b).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> This last-cited section imposes the penalties for violation of 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 4705. A conviction for general conspiracy under 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 371 is punishable by up to five years imprisonment and a $10,000.00 fine. Subsequent to his conviction, appellant acknowledged identity in an information alleging a previous conviction on December 8, 1952, for having violated then 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2557(b) (1). The District Court sentenced appellant to fifteen years imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-4\">Thereafter, on September 20, 1962, appellant filed his Rule 35 motion, seeking a correction of his sentence on the ground that since the jury failed to bring in a special verdict indicating which statute he had violated, i. e. 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 371 or 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 4705, the maximum sentence he could receive was five years, since there was no way the Court could determine which law the appellant violated. Therefore, he says, the least severe sentence should have been imposed and his 15-year sentence is illegal and, should be corrected. The District Court denied the motion, and appellant perfected the instant appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-5\">Appellant relies on Brown v. United States, 112 U.S.App.D.C. 57, 299 F.2d 438 (1962), cert. den. 370 U.S. 946, 82 S.Ct. 1593, 8 L.Ed.2d 812. In the Brown case, the indictment charged a conspiracy to violate several statutes. In absence of a special verdict, the Court held it was unable to determine which law the defendants there convicted conspired to violate. Therefore, the case was reversed to permit the sentencing Court to impose the least severe sentence fixed by the statutes involved, if the Government consented thereto; otherwise for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-8\"> In the case at bar, appellant was specifically charged with conspiring to violate only 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 4705. The penalties for conspiring to violate that statute are set forth in 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 7237 (a). The fact that Section 7237(a) has a built-in provision for conspiracy, and the indictment in the ease at bar included a citation to 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 371, the general conspiracy statute, does not make appellant\u2019s sentence ambiguous, or of uncertain premise. In the caption of his indictment, 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 4705 was cited and reference therein to 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 371 was a \u201cmiscitation\u201d. The more specific statute dealing with narcotic offenses, 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 4705, is controlling. Davis v. United States, 279 F.2d 576 (4 Cir., 1960). As stated in the Davis case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b696-9\">\u201cNor does this miscitation make illegal the sentence imposed though it exceeds the maximum permissible under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371. Congress, when it enlarged the penalties, and prescribed minimum prison terms, for narcotic offenses, issued a command which is binding upon the courts. The District Court was bound to impose sentence under 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 7237, rather than under 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 371, and the resulting sentence is not illegal.\u201d (At p. 578 of 279 F.2d.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b696-10\">Furthermore, as stated in Rule 7(c), F.R.Cr.P.:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b696-11\">\u201cError in the citation or its omission shall not be ground for dismissal of the indictment or information or for reversal of a conviction if the error or omission did not mislead the defendant to his prejudice.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b696-12\">\u201c * * * the statute on which an indictment is founded must be deter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>mined from the facts charged * * and the facts as pleaded may bring the offense charged within one statute, although another statute is referred to in the indictment.\u201d Masi v. United States, 223 F.2d 132 (5 Cir., 1955).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b697-5\">Appellant does not cite any prejudice against himself as a result of the above rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-6\">The District Court properly overruled appellant\u2019s motion to correct his sentence. Therefore, its judgment is</p>\n<p id=\"AKP\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b695-15\">. 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 371: \u201cIf two or more persons conspire either to commit any offense against the United States, or to defraud the United States, or any agency thereof in any manner or for any purpose, and one or more of such persons do any act to effect the object of the conspiracy, each shall be fined not more than $10,000 or imprisoned not more than five years, or both.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b695-30\">. 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 4705(a): \u201cGeneral requirement. \u2014 It shall be unlawful for any person to sell, barter, exchange, or give away narcotic drugs except in pursuance of a written order of the person to whom such article is sold, bartered, exchanged, or given, on a form to be issued in blank for that purpose by the Secretary or Ms delegate.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b696-6\">. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7237(b) : \u201cWhoever commits an offense, or conspires to commit an offense, described in section 4705(a), or section 4742(a) shall be imprisoned not less than 5 or more than 20 years and, in addition, may be fined not more than $20,-000.
