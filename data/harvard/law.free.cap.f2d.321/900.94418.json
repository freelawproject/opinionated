Earl Filler by his employer, McDonnell Aircraft Corporation, as traveling expenses while away from home, under \u00a7 162(a) (2) I.R.C. 1954.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-17\">The Tax Court determined that the facts in this case are not distinguishable from those in Cockrell v. C. I. R., 38 T.C. 470. We agree. Taxpayers point to no material distinction. The per diem allowances were paid Filler during the period from May 31, 1956, to June 11, 1959, during which period he was assigned by McDonnell for service as an experimental mechanic in connection with extensive contract work McDonnell was performing for the Government at the Holloman Air Force Base, New Mexico. Filler had previously been employed by McDonnell at its main base at St. Louis. He lived in his trailer house while in St. Louis and upon being assigned to Hollo-man, immediately moved there with his family and his trailer and continued to live there until reassigned to St. Louis in 1959. We accept taxpayers\u2019 testimony that they at all times considered St. Louis to be their home.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-18\">The findings of the Tax Court that Mr. Filler\u2019s principal place of duty was at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"901\">*901</page-number>Holloman during the tax years here involved, and that his employment there was for an indefinite and substantial period rather than for a temporary or short period are supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-5\">The Tax Court upheld the Commissioner\u2019s contention that the per diem allowances received were income and were not deductible as necessary business expenses incurred in traveling away from home, upon the basis of its Cockrell decision. We recently affirmed Cockrell. Cockrell v. Commissioner, 8 Cir., 321 F.2d 504. The taxpayers\u2019 contentions here urged are fully considered and answered adversely to them in Cockrell. We followed Cockrell in Kalist v. Commissioner, 8 Cir., 321 F.2d 508. Our decisions in Cockrell and Kalist are decisive! of the issues here presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
