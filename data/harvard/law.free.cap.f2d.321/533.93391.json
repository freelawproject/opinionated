Obviously it is not contemplated by the' bankruptcy act that petitions for fees should be desultorily handled, but even: though we must not order it, petitioners-should have had a reasonable time to get. ready.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-20\">We assume that the issuance of a writ will be unnecessary, once the district court is advised of this court\u2019s views, and that petitioners will have had ample time to prepare their defense when proper-notice has been given them.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
