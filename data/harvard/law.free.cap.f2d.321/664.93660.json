BROWN, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b715-18\">Our disposition of this appeal makes it necessary for us to consider only one question presented here by Defendants. That question is whether the indictment states an offense against the United States. The Defendants were tried and convicted under a six-count indictment. Count I charged them with conspiring to introduce into interstate commerce adulterated and misbranded food.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Counts II through VI charged the substantive offenses of introducing into interstate commerce foods which were <em>adulterated </em>or were <em>misbranded.</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>We conclude that the Defendants were prosecuted under the authority of a faulty indictment. The convictions are accordingly reversed and the cause remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-19\">It is essential to bear in mind that this is a prosecution for <em>economic </em>mis-branding or <em>economic </em>adulteration. In the sale of its products through the channels of established, reputable, re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>liable dairies and the like, there is not the slightest suggestion that Defendants\u2019 commodity was unwholesome. On the contrary, the Government conceded that \u201cthere is nothing wrong with their product, not a thing in the world,\u201d and that it \u201cis just as good and just as palatable and has as many vitamins as freshly squeezed\u201d orange juice. It stipulated that the Defendants\u2019 commodity was produced in \u201ca clean, modem, sanitary plant.\u201d The Court so recognized in its charge <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and while not immediately connected with our disposition, the jury under alternative verdict forms held that the violations were committed by Defendants \u201cwithout intent to defraud or mislead.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b716-4\">Since we do not reach the question of the sufficiency of the evidence to support the convictions, it is unnecessary to give a detailed statement of the facts. However, they briefly consist of these. Cal-Tex Citrus Juice, Inc. engaged in the business of making an orange drink. The product was composed of freshly squeezed orange juice, concentrated orange juice, water, sugar, and at times glucose and ascorbic acid. The product ordinarily contained these ingredients, and rarely was composed entirely of juice as it comes from an orange. The drink was produced in the Cal-Tex plant in Houston, Texas and shipped to points in Louisiana, Kansas, Missouri, and other states.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-5\">The Defendants used three corporations in their business of producing and distributing this orange drink. Each of the Defendants served in some capacity as officers and directors of each of these three corporations. Cal-Tex was the corporate entity which actually produced the drink. Transportation Leasing, Inc. was used by Defendants to own all of the rolling stock used in the production and delivery of the drink, as well as-being used for the purchase and delivery of sugar, frozen concentrate, Vitamin C, and glucose used in the production. Central States Processors, Inc. was another corporation which served' as the distributor of the orange drink.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-13\">To the indictment (see notes 1, 2 supra), Defendants filed a \u201cMotion Raising Defenses and Objections\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> plus a motion in arrest of judgment, F.R.Crim.P. 34, which asserted that the indictment did not state facts sufficient to state a criminal offense. The motions pointed out with great particularity the failure-of the indictment to allege facts and circumstances regarding misbranding and adulteration. Overruling these motions, the District Court necessarily held the indictment sufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-14\">The guidelines for determining the sufficiency of an indictment have been established for so many years that they are no longer open to question. We do not think it would be helpful to set out the many ways in which the rules have been stated. The rule as stated in 1833 was that \u201cin all cases, the offence must be set forth with clearness, and all necessary certainty, to apprise the accused of the crime with which he stands charged.\u201d\u2019 United States v. Mills, 1833, 7 Pet. 138, 32 U.S. 138, 142, 8 L.Ed. 636. Recently,, the criteria were reiterated with emphasis in Russell v. United States, 1962, 369 U.S. 749, 763, 82 S.Ct. 1038, 1046, 8 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>L.Ed.2d 240: \u201cThese criteria are, first, whether the indictment \u2018contains the elements of the offense intended to be charged, \u201cand sufficiently apprises the defendant of what he must be prepared to meet,\u201d \u2019 and, secondly, \u2018 \u201cin case any other proceedings are taken against him for a similar offence, whether the record shows with accuracy to what extent he may plead a former acquittal or conviction.\u201d \u2019 [citing cases].\u201d We have given recent, and decisive, recognition to these principles in Beitel v. United States, 5 Cir., 1962, 306 F.2d 665.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-4\">These judicial principles have descended from the Constitution which declares that \u201c[n]o person shall be held to answer for a capital, or otherwise infamous crime, unless on a presentment or indictment of a Grand Jury * * * nor shall any person be subject for the same of-fence to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb; * * * \u201d, and that \u201cIn all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right * * * to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation; * * *.\u201d U. S. Constitution, Amends. V, VI. Responding to these basic demands, F.R.Crim.P. 7(c) provides that \u201cThe indictment * * * shall be a plain, concise and definite written statement of the essential facts constituting the offense charged.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b717-8\">Important as are the two most emphasized criteria \u2014 (1) notice and (2) double jeopardy \u2014 the presentment by a Grand Jury has in our constitutional scheme another basic function. It is the protection to the citizen against unfounded charges. Little may be left open to construction or interpretation of an indietment. If the offense is not plainly stated and is made so only by a process of interpretation, there is no assurance that the Grand Jury would have charged such an offense. The Supreme Court has made this vividly clear in Smith v. United States, 1959, 360 U.S. 1, 9, 79 S.Ct. 991, 996, 3 L.Ed.2d 1041. \u201cThe Fifth Amendment made the [common law rule requiring indictments] mandatory in federal prosecutions in recognition of the fact that the intervention of a grand jury was a substantial safeguard against oppressive and arbitrary proceedings.\u201d And even more recently it has been emphasized in Russell. \u201cTo allow the prosecutor, or the court, to make a subsequent guess as to what was in the minds of the grand jury at the time they returned the indictment would deprive the defendant of a basic protection which the guaranty of the intervention of a grand jury was-designed to secure. For a defendant could then be convicted on the basis of facts not found by, and perhaps not even presented to, the grand jury which indicted him.\u201d 369 U.S. 749, 770, 82 S.Ct. 1038, 1050. It was just such principles which led us to confine tolling exceptions to indictments as such, not informations tentatively in lieu of indictments. Hattaway v. United States, 5 Cir., 1962, 304 F.2d 5, 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-11\">The first count of the indictment here charged the Defendants with a conspiracy to violate the laws of the United States (note 1, supra), 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 371. The attack made on this Count is that it does not state an offense. With this, we-are in basic agreement. The indictment alleges the conspiracy in typical terms in that the Defendants \u201cdid unlawfully, knowingly, * * * conspire, confederate, and agree together * * * \u201d to violate laws of the United States. This-Count also alleges the manner in which the Defendants worked together, e. g., they were interrelated officers and directors of the various corporations, etc. We' may assume that this Count adequately charges the existence of the conspiracy, i. e., agreement, and also some of the means or overt acts by which it was being carried out. But the fault with Count I lies, not in the conspiracy element, but in its failure to meet the standards described above in setting out the manner by which the specified federal laws have been violated.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-12\">Paragraphs 1 and 2 of Count I allege that in furtherance of the conspiracy, the Defendants introduced into interstate commerce a food \u201cwhich was adulterated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>within the meaning of\u201d 21 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 342(b) (2) and (4). These sections state that a food is adulterated \u201c(2) if any substance has been substituted wholly or in part therefor * * * or (4) if any substance has been added thereto or mixed or packed therewith so as to increase its bulk or weight, or reduce its quality or strength, or make it appear better or of greater value than it is.\u201d <footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b718-3\">Paragraphs 3, 4, and 5 of Count I alleged that the Defendants conspired to introduce into interstate commerce a food \u201cwhich was misbranded within the meaning of\u201d 21 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 343(a), (b), (i) (2).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b718-4\">At the outset we think it appropriate to point out that the Government\u2019s response to this contention confuses the Defendants\u2019 constitutional right to know what <em>offense </em>is charged with his need to know the <em>evidentiary details </em>establishing the facts of such offense. As to the latter, the remedy lies in the Motion for Bill of Particulars, F.R.Crim.P. 7(f).</p>\n<p id=\"b718-5\">Here the conspiracy indictment as to adulteration essentially charges only that Defendants \u201cwould produce a food represented to be pure orange juice, but which in truth and in fact the defendants would misbrand and adulterate by adding to orange juice, sugar, water, and other ingredients.\u201d <footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b718-16\">But this is not a federal crime unless it contravenes a statute.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The statute specified was \u00a7 342(b) (2) and (4). But this charges a variety of unknown actions. Thus, under subparagraph (2) it is adulterated \u201cif any substance has been substituted wholly or in part <em>therefor\u201d </em>(emphasis added). \u201cTherefor\u201d for what? Subparagraph (2) does not make sense without sub-paragraph (1) as an antecedent. But subparagraph (1) deals with the omission or abstraction in whole or in part of \u201cany valuable constituent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b718-17\"> For there to be a crime under (2), there must be the <em>substitution </em>of \u201cany substance\u201d for some \u201cvaluable constituent\u201d of the food. Unless there is a \u201cvaluable constituent\u201d plus a substitution of \u201cany substance\u201d for it, there is simply no crime. But the trial Court cannot guess, and the Defendants may not constitutionally be compelled to guess, what it was (if anything) the Grand Jury had in mind. With the infinite variety of foods now manufactured and processed, the indictment must specify what the \u201cvaluable constituent\u201d is and then <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>charge what \u201csubstance has been substituted * * * therefor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b719-5\">Neither in the conspiracy count nor the substantive counts (note 2, supra) is there even the vaguest hint as to what the \u201cvaluable constituent\u201d is or even that the Defendants \u201cby adding to orange juice, sugar, water, and other ingredients\u201d were making a substitution \u201ctherefor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b719-6\">The deficiency is even more startling as to \u00a7 342(b) (4). There are at least three different kinds of adulterations resulting from \u201cany substance\u201d that \u201chas been added * * * mixed or packed therewith.\u201d The first is when the effect is \u201cto increase its bulk or weight.\u201d Second, when it is to \u201creduce its quality or strength.\u201d The third when it is to \u201cmake it appear better or of greater value than it is.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b719-14\">Just what was it the Grand Jury thought these Defendants had done ? Increased weight? Its bulk? Kedueed its quality? Its strength? Or made it appear better or greater? Better or greater than what? <footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b719-15\">Under subparagraph (2) incorporating necessarily subparagraph (1) and the introductory alternatives of subparagraph (4) with its still further alternative acts, there is a minimum of eleven possible crimes. Did the Grand Jury intend to charge all eleven? Must the Defendants guess what ones were intended, thereby putting on the Defendants the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>burden of developing evidentiary detail as to all? To the extent that the queries can be answered by response to a Bill of Particulars, the Defendants may not in fact have been deprived of the right to know what proof they would have to meet. But this is only part of it. For the District Attorney is not the Grand Jury, and he may not determine what it is that the Grand Jury has charged. If the choice of one or more out of many unidentified crimes may be made by the prosecutor, then presentment by a Grand Jury will have become a useless, historic ritual.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b720-4\">What has been said as to \u201cadulteration\u201d requires a reversal of the conspiracy count regardless of its sufficiency as to \u201cmisbranding.\u201d The guilty verdict was general. With inquiry forever foreclosed, it is just as likely that the verdict was based on the <em>insufficient </em>charge of adulteration as on misbranding. Consequently, we do not need to determine whether the conspiracy count adequately charges as an object thereof the separate offense of misbranding. \u00a7 343(a), (b), and (i) (2).</p>\n<p id=\"b720-17\">But we do have to face the problem in relation to the substantive counts IV and VI (note 2, supra). Except to identify the time, places and quantity of a shipment of \u201c * * * food represented to be pure fresh orange juice,\u201d the indictment merely charges in the words of the statute that \u201csuch food was mis-branded within the meaning of\u201d \u00a7 343 (a), (b), and (i) (2).</p>\n<p id=\"b721-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>While the structure of \u00a7 343(a), (b) (see note 6, supra) is not so complex as \u00a7 342, its relation to the balance of the Act makes a charge merely in statutory terms inadequate. A food<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> is misbranded if the label is \u201c(a) * * * false or misleading in any particular,\u201d or the item is \u201c(b) * * * offered for sale under the name of another food.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b721-6\">We might assume that \u201cfalse\u201d carries its usual meaning. But \u201cmisleading\u201d has its own peculiar statutory meaning.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The statute envisages therefore that there might be a misleading label without it being false and vice versa. What is claimed here? That the label was false <em>or </em>misleading? Misleading, but not false ? Misleading <em>and </em>false ? False, but not misleading? And if misleading, in what way does the particular shipment come within the statutory definition of that term? (See note 12, supra).</p>\n<p id=\"b721-7\">It should be noted that in the substantive counts there is not even a single word about the addition of sugar, water, etc. Nor is there the slightest hint as to what made the label as to the product \u201crepresented to be pure fresh orange juice\u201d misleading or false.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-8\">The shortcomings are even more flagrant as to misbranding from the item being \u201c(b) * * * offered for sale under the name of another food.\u201d That charge involves at least two elements. The first is the real name of the food sold. Second is the name of the <em>other </em>food. What was the name of the food as shipped here? What was the name of the other food? It only gets worse when we look at the <em>conjunctive </em>charge of misbranding under (i) (2). First, that automatically brings into play \u00a7 343(g). More important, it requires that for an item not having a sub-paragraph (g) standard of identity, the label must show \u201c(1) the common or usual name of the food, if any there be * * Did this \u201cfood\u201d as shipped have a common name? If so, what was it? Or was it nameless under the phrase \u201cif any there be\u201d ? While subparagraph (1) was not specifically alleged, it relates directly to subparagraph (2). Subpara-graph (2) requires the usual names of ingredients if the food is \u201cfabricated from two or more ingredients.\u201d Here there was not a single word in the substantive counts charging that the shipment was \u201cfabricated,\u201d whatever that means. Nor was there any factual statement as to what the \u201cingredients\u201d were, or what their usual names were.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-15\">Wrapped up in the easy generality \u201cmisbranded within the meaning of\u201d \u00a7 343(a), (b), and (i) (2) were not less than six possible, but separate, offenses. Were all six intended? Or only two? Or three? Which ones? This deficiency was not cured by the bill of particulars. For it is not the office of a bill of particulars to ascertain what offense is charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-16\">The long and short of it is that the Defendants were not sufficiently apprised of the nature of the charges being made so that they could adequately prepare a defense. Although evidentiary detail as to a few of the missing pieces was supplied in the Government\u2019s answer to the Defendants\u2019 motion for a bill of particulars, \u201cit is a settled rule that a bill of particulars cannot save an invalid indictment.\u201d Russell v. United <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>States, supra, 369 U.S. at 770, 82 S.Ct. at 1050; Beitel v. United States, supra, 306 F.2d at 671. The indictment completely relied on the statutes for stating an offense. An indictment in the language of the offended statute is valid if the words of the statute \u201cfully, directly, and expressly, without any uncertainty or ambiguity, set forth all the elements necessary to constitute the offence intended to be punished.\u201d But if the statute is plead\u00e9d in the indictment in general terms, \u201cit must be accompanied with' such a statement of the facts and circumstances as will inform the accused of the specific offence, coming under the general description, with which he is charged.\u201d Russell v. United States, supra, 369 U.S. at 765, 82 S.Ct. at 1047.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-4\"> This seems especially necessary as to acts asserted to be criminal offenses under a statutory scheme as complex as this one and in which severe penalties of fine and imprisonment may be exacted even as misdemeanors when the actions taken or omitted ar\u00e9 determined to have been done with no \u201cintent to defraud or mislead.\u201d 21 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 333(a), (b). When, as this statute permits, innocuous and morally innocent actions may send'men to jail for long periods of time because mistakes in processing or labeling, etc. result in <em>economic </em>adulteration, it is essential that the offense (or offenses) be identified and charged in terms which adequately relate the actions to the statute.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> This in no sense implies that we require the pleading of evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-5\">For the reasons discussed above, all of the Counts were defective. The judgments of conviction are reversed and the causes remanded with directions to dismiss the indictments.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-6\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b715-8\">. Count I of the indictment charged a violation of 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 371 in that the Defendants \u201cdid unlawfully, knowingly, * * * conspire * * * to * * * introduce into interstate commerce * * * with intent to defraud and mislead, a food which was <em>adulterated </em>within the meaning of * * * \u201d 21 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 342(b) (2) and 342(b) (4) \u201cin violation of\u201d 21 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 331(a), 333 (b) and \u201cto introduce into interstate \u2022commerce * * * with intent to defraud and mislead, a food which was <em>misbranded </em>within the meaning of\u201d 21 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 343(a), 343(b), 343(i) (2) \u201cin violation of\u201d 21 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 331(a), 333 (b).

In argument as to the third point (no ascertainable criterion of guilt in absence of promulgation of administrative standards of identity), the Defendants\u2019 brief develops the many mysteries enshrouded in the words of subparagraph (4) <em>barring </em>specific factual allegations:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b719-9\">\u201cNow some pertinent inquiries: What is \u2018better than it is?\u2019 What is \u2018of greater value than it is ?\u2019' What is the standard of \u2018its quality?\u2019 By what do you determine \u2018its strength\u2019? What is the norm for bulk and for weight? <em>Without Standards of Indentity how is it possible to know?</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b719-10\">\u201cApply similar questions to the Orange Juice Industry: What is \u2018orange juice\u2019? What is the norm for Brix acid ratio (Soluble solids to acid) for standard orange juice? Is reconstituted orange juice \u2018orange juice\u2019? Is blended orange juice \u2018orange juice\u2019? Is homogenized orange juice \u2018orange juice\u2019? Is pasteurized orange juice \u2018orange juice\u2019? Is the mixing of orange juice reconstituted from frozen orange juice concentrates with orange juice squeezed today illegal? Is the adding of the water necessary to reconstitute concentrated frozen orange juice illegal? In what proportions can the reconstituted juice be used? In what proportions must orange juice squeezed today be used? When orange juice squeezed today is too high in acid content for a proper standard of flavor can concentrates frozen last autumn from sweeter fruits be blended to maintain the necessary standard for taste? In the process of blending juices are you reducing the quality of one type of juice and making another appear better than it is? In blending when are you increasing bulk and weight and when are you not? <em>Without Standards of Indentity hoto is it possible to </em>know1</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b719-17\">\u201cFurther: To whom must the food \u2018appear better or of greater value than it is?\u2019 Is it the consumer or the Government Inspector? If the consumer, is it the discerning consumer, the indifferent consumer, or the average consumer? If the average consumer, is it the average consumer in the Texas Valley, in the Panhandle, in Missouri, Louisiana, or Kalamazoo? Assume sales to all such areas, must the product meet the differing viewpoints of average consumers in different areas, if not, which controls? Who is to determine in advance, and how, the decision of the \u2018average consumer\u2019 in any of such places? <em>Without Standards ards of Identity how is it possible to know'.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b719-18\">Judge Hastie, perhaps in more restrained language, undergoes similar judicial travail.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b719-19\">\u201cIn the context of the present case, it is our conclusion that the language of Section 402(b) (4) covers a situation in which the challenged process of manufacture was the inclusion of one or more designated ingredients among the primary integral components of a distinct fabricated article. It is not important whether the final product has been achieved by a direct dilution of orange juice or, as here, by a more complex process of fabrication.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b719-20\">\u201cMore difficult questions arise in construing and applying in the requirement of the statute that admixture shall have made the food \u2018appear better than it is.\u2019 To whom must the food \u2018appear better than it is\u2019? And how is it to be deter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>mined whether the food \u2018appears better than it is\u2019?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b720-6\">*****</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b720-7\">&lt;i * * * Thus, in the case before us, proof of violation of the statute requires first description and definition of the superior counterpart, and second, proof that the consumer is likely to mistake the inferior for the superior.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b720-8\">*****</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b720-9\">ii * * * ma]jes little sense to speak of concealment of inferiority except when we add to <em>what. </em>(Emphasis the Court\u2019s.) It makes equally little sense to speak of misleading enhancement of appearance except in relation to some standard which by some reasonable technique has been made relevant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b720-11\">*****</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b720-12\">\u00ab* * * Again, the conclusion on adulteration is rested squarely on the deception potential of the product sold in relation to a familiar standard.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b720-14\">* $ $ $ *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b720-15\">\u201cLegislative consideration of the problem of standards under the Act gives further support to our conclusion that Section 402(b) (4) is not applicable if the allegedly adulterated food is its own only standard. The inability of the government to establish enforcible standards for fabricated foods, considerably hampered the work of enforcement of 1906 Act. 'The solution to this problem suggested in the course of legislative consideration of the 1938 bill, and in due course adopted, was the enactment of provisions giving the Secretary of Agriculture power to promulgate standards of identity for foods. Such standards were to be imposed only after full and fair hearing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b720-18\">\u201cQuestions of various permissible degrees of dilution which were regarded below as relevant and in issue are peculiarly appropriate for disposition by this administrative technique. Under the required administrative procedure, the whole industry can participate in the determination whether orange-flavored soft drinks are capable of satisfactory definition, how their composition should be restricted, and even whether such a food as orange drink, or any of its variants, should be permitted in commerce. Cf. Federal Security Administrator v. Quaker Oats Co. [318 U.S. 218, 63 S.Ct. 589, 87 L.Ed. 724] supra.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b720-20\">* * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b720-21\">* * * * ag airea(jy indicated, we think the procedure used here permits condemnation only where there is confusion with a defined superior product. <em>If the government loould go further it must undertake the formulation of standards of identity in this arrea.\u201d </em>(Emphasis supplied) United States v. 88 Cases, 3 Cir., 1951, 187 F.2d 967, 971.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b720-23\">As emphasizing his remarks, Judge Hastie pointed to the legislative history of a former act (footnote 4):</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b720-25\">\u201cThese provisions [of the Act] in themselves imply the existence of definitions and standards of identity, since no one can tell when an article is adulterated under them without first determining definitely what constitutes the unadulterated product.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b720-26\">. For the reasons discussed above, Counts II, III, and V (note 2, supra) are also defective in charging the substantive offense of adulteration.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b721-9\">. Food is defined as \u201c(1) articles used for food or drink for man or other animals, (2) chewing gum, and (3) articles used for components of any such article.\u201d 21 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 321(f).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b721-11\">. 21 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 321 (n): \u201cIf an article is alleged to be misbranded because the labeling is misleading, then in determining whether the labeling is misleading there shall be taken into account (among other things) not only representations made or suggested by statement, word, design, device, or any combination thereof, but also the extent to which the labeling fails to reveal facts material in the light of such representations or material with respect to consequences which may result from the use of the article to which the labeling relates under the conditions of use prescribed in the labeling thereof or under such conditions of use as are customary or usual.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b722-7\">. These comments rest on the literal terms of the statute which we assume, without deciding, to be valid. In view of our disposition we intimate no view on any of the other contentions of the Defendants. Specifically, we do not reach the claim that in the absence of promulgated standards of identity, there is no lawfully ascertainable criterion of guilt even under cases such as United States v. Behrman, 1922, 258 U.S. 280, 42 S.Ct. 303, 66 L.Ed. 619; United States v. Balint, 1922, 258 U.S. 250, 42 S.Ct. 301, 66 L.Ed. 604; United States v. Dotterweich, 1943, 320 U.S. 277, 64 S.Ct. 134, 88 L.Ed. 48; and see, Standard Oil Co. of Texas v. United States, 5 Cir., 1962, 307 F.2d 120.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
