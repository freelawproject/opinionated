MOORE, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"ako-dedup-1\">This action by brought by appellant King-Seeley Thermos Co. (King-Seeley)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> to enjoin the defendant, Aladdin Industries, Incorporated from threatened infringement of eight trademark registrations for the word \u201cThermos\u201d owned by appellant. Defendant answered, acknowledging its intention to sell its vacuum-insulated containers as \u201cthermos bottles\u201d, asserted that the term \u201cthermos\u201d or \u201cthermos bottle\u201d is a generic term in the English language, asked that plaintiff\u2019s registrations of its trademark \u201cThermos\u201d be cancelled and that it be adjudicated that plaintiff have no trademark rights in the word \u201cthermos\u201d on its vacuum bottles. The trial court held that plaintiff\u2019s registrations were valid but that the word \u201cthermos\u201d had become \u201ca generic descriptive word in the English language * * * as a synonym for \u2018vacuum insulated\u2019 container.\u201d 207 F.Supp. 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-18\">The facts are set out at great length in the comprehensive and well-reasoned opinion of the district court and will not be detailed here. In that opinion, the court reviewed King-Seeley\u2019s corporate history and its use of the trademark \u201cThermos\u201d. He found that from 1907 to 1923, King-Seeley undertook advertising and educational campaigns that tended to make \u201cthermos\u201d a generic term descriptive of the product rather than of its origin. This consequence flowed from the corporation\u2019s attempt to popularize \u201cThermos bottle\u201d as the name of that product without including any of the generic terms then used, such as \u201cThermos vacuum-insulated bottle\u201d. The court found that by 1923 the word \u201cthermos\u201d had acquired firm roots as a descriptive or generic word.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-19\">At about 1923, because of the suggestion in an opinion of a district court<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> that \u201cThermos\u201d might be a descriptive word, King-Seeley adopted the use of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>the word \u201cvacuum\u201d or \u201cvacuum bottle\u201d with the word \u201cThermos\u201d. Although \u201cThermos\u201d was generally recognized in the trade as a trademark, the corporation did police the trade and notified those using \u201cthermos\u201d in a descriptive sense that it was a trademark. It failed, however, to take affirmative action to seek out generic uses by non-trade publications and protested only those which happened to come to its attention. Between 1923 and the early 1950\u2019s the generic use of \u201cthermos\u201d had grown to a marked extent in non-trade publications and by the end of this period there was wide-spread use by the unorganized public of \u201cthermos\u201d as a synonym for \u201cvacuum insulated.\u201d The court concluded that KingSeeley had failed to use due diligence to rescue \u201cThermos\u201d from becoming a descriptive or generic term. <em>99</em></p>\n<p id=\"b627-2\">Between 1954 and 1957, plaintiff showed awareness of the widespread generic use of \u201cthermos\u201d and of the need to educate the public to the word\u2019s trademark significance. It diversified its products to include those not directly related to containers designed to keep their contents hot or cold. It changed its name from the American Thermos Bottle Company to The American Thermos Products Company and intensified its policing activities of trade and non-trade publications. The court found, however, that the generic use of \u201cthermos\u201d had become so firmly impressed as a part of the everyday language of the American public that plaintiff\u2019s extraordinary efforts commencing in the mid-1950\u2019s came too late to keep \u201cthermos\u201d from falling into the public domain. The court also held that appellant\u2019s trademarks are valid and because there is an appreciable, though minority, segment of the consumer public which knows and recognizes plaintiff\u2019s trademarks, it imposed certain restrictions and limitations on the use of the word \u201cthermos\u201d by defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-3\">We affirm the district court\u2019s decision that the major significance of the word \u201cthermos\u201d is generic. No useful purpose would be served by repeating here what is fully documented in the opinion of the court below.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\">Appellant\u2019s primary protest on appeal is directed at the district court\u2019s finding that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-6\">\u201cThe word \u2018thermos\u2019 became a part of the public domain because of the plaintiff\u2019s wide dissemination of the word \u2018thermos\u2019 used as a synonym for \u2018vacuum-insulated\u2019 and as an adjectival-noun, \u2018thermos\u2019, through its educational and advertising campaigns and because of the plaintiff\u2019s lack of reasonable diligence in asserting and protecting its trademark rights in the word \u2018Thermos\u2019 among the members of the unorganized public, exclusive of those in the trade, from 1907 to the date of this action.\u201d 207 F.Supp. at 14.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b627-7\">We are not convinced that the trademark\u2019s loss of distinctiveness was the result of some failure on plaintiff\u2019s part. Substantial efforts to preserve the trademark significance of the word were made by plaintiff, especially with respect to members of the trade. However, there was little they could do to prevent the public from using \u201cthermos\u201d in a generic rather than a trademark sense. And whether the appropriation by the public was due to highly successful educational and advertising campaigns or to lack of diligence in policing or not is of no consequence; the fact is that the word \u201cthermos\u201d had entered the public domain beyond recall. Even as early as 1910 plaintiff itself asserted that \u201cThermos had become a household word.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b627-8\">Judge Anderson found that although a substantial majority of the public knows and uses the word \u201cthermos\u201d, only a small minority of the public knows that this word has trademark significance. He wrote at 207 F.Supp. 21-22:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-9\">\u201cThe results of the survey [conducted at the behest of the defendant] were that about 75% of adults in the United States who were familiar with containers that keep the contents hot or cold, call such a container a \u2018thermos\u2019; about 12% of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>the adult American public know that \u2018thermos\u2019 has a trade-mark significance, and about 11% use the term \u2018vacuum bottle\u2019. This is generally corroborative of the court\u2019s conclusions drawn from the other evidence, except that such other evidence indicated that a somewhat larger minority than 12% was aware of the trade-mark meaning of \u2018thermos\u2019; and a somewhat larger minority than 11% used the descriptive term \u2018vacuum\u2019 bottle or other container.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b628-3\">The record amply supports these findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-4\">Appellant argues that the court below misapplied the doctrine of the Aspirin <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and Cellophane <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> cases. Its primary contention is that in those cases, there was no generic name, such as vacuum bottle, that was suitable for use by the general public. As a result, to protect the use of the only word that identified the product in the mind of the public would give the owners of the trademark an unfair competitive advantage. The rule of those cases, however, does not rest on this factor. Judge Learned Hand stated the sole issue in Aspirin to be: \u201cWhat do the buyers understand by the word for whose use the parties are contending? If they understand by it only the kind of goods sold, then, I take it, it makes no difference whatever what efforts the plaintiff has made to get them to understand more.\u201d 272 F. at 509. Of course, it is obvious that the fact that there was no suitable descriptive word for either aspirin or cellophane made it difficult, if not impossible, for the original manufacturers to prevent their trademark from becoming generic. But the test is not what is available as an alternative to the public, but what the public\u2019s understanding is of the word that it uses. What has happened here is that the public had become accustomed to calling vacuum bottles by the word \u201cthermos\u201d. If a buyer walked into a retail store asking for a thermos bottle, meaning any vacuum bottle and not specifically plaintiff\u2019s product, the fact that the appellation \u201cvacuum bottle\u201d was available to him is of no significance. The two terms had become synonymous; in fact, defendant\u2019s survey showed that the public was far more inclined to use the word \u201cthermos\u201d to describe a container that keeps its contents hot or cold than the phrase \u201cvacuum bottle\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-8\">Appellant asserts that the courts in a number of cases have upheld the continued exclusive use of a dual functioning trademark, which both identifies the class of product as well as its source. See, e. g., Standard Brands v. Smidler, 151 F.2d 34 (2 Cir. 1945) (\u201cV-8\u201d); Walgreen v. Obear-Nester, 113 F.2d 956 (8 Cir.), cert. denied, 311 U.S. 708, 61 S.Ct. 174, 85 L.Ed. 459 (1940) (\u201cPyrex\u201d); Marks v. Polaroid Corp., 129 F.Supp. 243 (D.Mass. 1955), aff\u2019d 237 F.2d 428 (1 Cir. 1956) (\u201cPolaroid\u201d); Q-Tips v. Johnson &amp; Johnson, 108 F.Supp. 845 (D.N.J. 1952), aff\u2019d 206 F.2d 144 (3 Cir.), cert. denied, 346 U.S. 867, 74 S.Ct. 106, 98 L.Ed. 377 (1953) (\u201cQ-Tips\u201d); Keebler Weyl Baking Co. v. J. S. Ivins\u2019 Son, 7 F.Supp. 211 (E.D.Pa.1934) (\u201cClub Crackers\u201d); Barnes v. Pierce, 164 F. 213 (S.D.N.Y.1908) (\u201cArgyrol\u201d). As this court recently indicated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-10\">\u201ca mark is not generic merely because it has <em>some </em>significance to the public as an indication of the nature or class of an article. * * * In order to become generic the <em>principal </em>significance of the word must be its indication of the nature or class of an article, rather than an indication of its origin.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b628-12\">Feathercombs, Inc. v. Solo Products Corp., 306 F.2d 251, 256 (2 Cir.), cert. denied, 371 U.S. 910, 83 S.Ct. 253, 9 L.Ed.2d 170 (1962). But see Marks v. Polaroid Corp., supra, 129 F.Supp. at 270 (\u201ca defendant alleging invalidity of a trademark for genericness must show that to the consuming public as a whole the word has lost all its trademark significance\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b629-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>Since in this case, the primary significance to the public of the word \u201cthermos\u201d is its indication of the nature and class of an article rather than as an indication of its source, whatever duality of meaning the word still holds for a minority of the public is of little consequence except as a consideration in the framing \u2022of a decree. Since the great majority of those members of the public who use the word \u201cthermos\u201d are not aware of any trademark significance, there is not \u2022enough dual use to support King-Seeley\u2019s claims to monopoly of the word as a trademark.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-4\">No doubt, the Aspirin and Cellophane doctrine can be a harsh one for it places a penalty on the manufacturer who has made skillful use of advertising and has popularized his product. See 3 Callman, Unfair Competition and Trademarks 1149-50 (2d ed. 1950). However, KingSeeley has enjoyed a commercial monopoly of the word \u201cthermos\u201d for over fifty years. During that period, despite its efforts to protect the trademark, the public has virtually expropriated it as its own. The word having become part of the public domain, it would be unfair to unduly restrict the right of a competitor of King-Seeley to use the word.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-5\">The court below, mindful of the fact that some members of the public and a substantial portion of the trade still recognize and use the word \u201cthermos\u201d as a trademark, framed an eminently fair decree designed to afford King-Seeley as much future protection as was possible. The decree provides that defendant must invariably precede the use of the word \u201cthermos\u201d by the possessive of the name \u201cAladdin\u201d; that the defendant must confine its use of \u201cthermos\u201d to the lower-case \u201ct\u201d; and that it may never use the words \u201coriginal\u201d or \u201cgenuine\u201d in describing its product. See Bayer Co. v. United Drug Co, 272 F. 505 (S.D.N.Y. <em>1921); </em>DuPont Cellophane Co. v. Waxed Products Co, 85 F.2d 75 (2 Cir. 1936). In addition, plaintiff is entitled to retain the exclusive right to all of its present forms of the trademark \u201cThermos\u201d without change. These conditions provide a sound and proper balancing of the competitive disadvantage to defendants arising out of plaintiff\u2019s exclusive use of the word \u201cthermos\u201d and the risk that those who recognize \u201cThermos\u201d as a trademark will be deceived.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-7\">The courts should be ever alert, as the district court said, \u201cto eliminate confusion and the possibility of deceit.\u201d The purchasing public is entitled to know the source of the article it desires to purchase. It is not within our province to speculate whether the dire predictions made by appellant in forceful appellate argument will come to pass. Certain it is that the district court made every endeavor in its judgment to give as much protection to plaintiff as possible. The use by defendant of the now generic word \u201cthermos\u201d was substantially curtailed. Plaintiff\u2019s trademark \u201cthermos\u201d was protected in every style of printing except the lower case \u201cthermos\u201d and then the use of the word must be preceded by the possessive of defendant\u2019s name \u201cAladdin\u201d or the possessive of \u201cAladdin\u201d plus one of defendant\u2019s brand names. Any doubt about plaintiff\u2019s position in the field is removed by the prohibition against the use by defendant in labeling, advertising or publication of the words \u201cg-enuine\u201d or \u201coriginal\u201d in referring to the word \u201cthermos\u201d. Furthermore, the district court has given both parties the opportunity to apply to it for such orders and directions as may be warranted in the light of changed circumstances and for the enforcement of compliance or for the punishment of violations. In our opinion the trial court has reached a most equitable solution which gives appropriate consideration to the law and the facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-8\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b626-15\">.
