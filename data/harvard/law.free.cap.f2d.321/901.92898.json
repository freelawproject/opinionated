The district court found that the plaintiff was improperly discharged but held that he had failed to mitigate his damages. Accordingly the court reduced the damages to $566.64, plus attorneys\u2019 fees of $500.00 and costs. The plaintiff appealed, limiting his appeal to review of the amount of the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-23\">The district court found that the defendant made an offer of re-employment June 27, 1957, only three days after he was discharged. The court held therefore that recovery should be limited to loss of wages for three days, plus the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"902\">*902</page-number>difference in wages due to loss of seniority from June 24, 1957 to January 4, 1960. The record supports the trial judge\u2019s findings. The conclusions of law are in accord with the law of Texas, controlling in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-4\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
