In support of his order, the district judge filed a memorandum opinion.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b137-4\">While the respondent, appellant here, in his brief vigorously contests the correctness of the order, we think it clear that the district judge was right, for the reason that he gave, and that his judgment granting the writ without prejudice to the State of Texas to retry the petitioner on the indictment pending in a state district court, within a reasonable time from the date of the judgment in this case, should be, and it is hereby AFFIRMED.
