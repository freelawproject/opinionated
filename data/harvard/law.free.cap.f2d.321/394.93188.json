The court agreed and enjoined the Board from terminating Pan American\u2019s route certificate in the proceeding before the Board, while permitting the investigation to continue with this restriction. Appeals were filed by Alaska Airlines [Appeal No. 17,469], which had intervened in the District Court proceeding, and by the Civil Aeronautics Board [Appeal No. 17,473].</p>\n<p id=\"b443-18\">Appellants here challenge the District Court\u2019s jurisdiction and claim that any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>attack on the Board\u2019s authority or possible action is premature.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-4\">We have no way of knowing whether the Board will make one of five concededly valid orders out of the six possible alternatives referred to in Order E 18120. Thus we do not have a situation in which any order of the Board would be invalid.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Here there is no \u201corder on [its] face plainly invalid,\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> but merely the possibility of an invalid order. Unlike the Court in Skinner &amp; Eddy Corp. v. United States, 249 U.S. 557, 39 S.Ct. 375, 63 L.Ed. 772 (1919), we do not yet know what the Board\u2019s final determination will be.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">Pan American claims that Chicago &amp; Southern Air Lines v. Waterman Corp., 333 U.S. 103, 68 S.Ct. 431, 92 L.Ed. 568 (1948), precludes judicial review of a decision of the Civil Aeronautics Board which is subject to Presidential determination; hence it says the doctrine of exhaustion of administrative remedies is inapplicable in this cas\u00e9.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b444-6\">Waterman clearly sets down the doctrine that there is to be neither judicial review of appropriate Civil Aeronautics Board decisions prior to their submission to the President nor review of \u201csuch provisions of the order as resulted from Presidential direction.\u201d Id. 333 U.S. at 111, 68 S.Ct. at 436, 92 L.Ed. 568. In that case the Supreme Court was concerned with the merits of the final Presidential determination, and concluded that the merits of the controversy should be withdrawn from judicial scrutiny, for such decision might have been made for reasons of foreign policy, which \u201care decisions of a kind for which the Judiciary has neither aptitude, facilities nor responsibility.\u201d Ibid.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-15\">Whether the President has statutory or constitutional authority to terminate Pan American\u2019s route authorization for reasons of public convenience and necessity is quite a different question from the one which faced the Court in Waterman. That c^ise neither settles nor illuminates more than faintly the issues which would face a court reviewing the authority of the Board or the President in this case to terminate Pan American\u2019s route authorization.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Furthermore, the Government states in its brief that \u201ca final order by the President terminating appellee\u2019s route * * * would be subject to judicial scrutiny on the limited question of whether the President and the Board have exceeded their statutory and constitutional authority.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b444-17\">In view of the uncertainty of the outcome of this proceeding now before the Board, and the further uncertainty that appellee will be denied judicial review of the final Presidential order,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> we believe judicial determination of the questions presented by appellee at this time is premature. The cumulative speculations of appellee do not now warrant judicial intervention in an orderly administrative process.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-18\">It follows that the judgment of the District Court is vacated and the cases are remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-19\">So ordered.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b443-9\">.
