The controversy arose out of an automobile accident which occurred upon a straight, dry highway in the daytime. The essential factual question is whether the defendant\u2019s vehicle swerved across the center line of the highway into the path of the plaintiff\u2019s oncoming automobile, or whether it was the plaintiff who crossed the center line of the highway into the path of the defendant\u2019s vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-22\">On the essential factual dispute, there was conflicting testimony. The defendant contends, however, that the physical facts belie the plaintiff\u2019s version of the occurrence. He refers to certain skid marks on the highway, gouge marks, and the location of debris. There was no certainty in the testimony that the skid marks observed on the highway were made by the vehicles involved in the collision, however, and the testimony of the location of the debris and gouge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>marks and the inferences to be drawn from it are inconclusive. Under the circumstances, the District Judge properly concluded that the issue was one for the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
