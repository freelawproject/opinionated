Defendant Santa Fe has appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-13\">' Plaintiff, a Santa Fe cook, broke his leg when he fell in the vestibule of a pullman car. He had left the diner kitchen of the Super Chief, walked through the pullman car and got off at its vestibule to get provisions at the commissary a short way from the cars. On his return he boarded the pullman car, slipped in the vestibule and was injured.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-15\">Santa Fe contends the District Court erred in denying its motion for directed verdict. It argues there was no competent evidence to prove that it negligently failed to provide plaintiff a safe place to work.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-16\">On this contention we must view the evidence, and all the inferences reasonably drawable therefrom, in the light most favorable to plaintiff and decide whether reasonable men may with fair judgments differ from one another. Threatt v. United States Steel Corp., 283 F.2d 411 (7th Cir. 1960). Also, conflicts in the testimony must be resolved in plaintiff\u2019s favor. Ziegler v. Equitable Life Assur. Soc\u2019y., 284 F.2d 661 (7th Cir. 1960), 5 Moore Federal Practice 2315-16 (2d ed. 1951). And if there is doubt, or the question is close, the case should go to the jury. Bailey v. Central Vermont Ry., 319 U.S. 350, 63 S.Ct. 1062, 87 L.Ed. 1444 (1943).</p>\n<p id=\"b366-17\">There was testimony that plaintiff walked up the steps to the car, stepped into the vestibule, his right foot slipped from under him and he fell; that he felt the steel vestibule floor and it was \u201cvery slippery,\u201d \u201cslippery as ice,\u201d and felt \u201cdamp, wet\u201d and \u201cfelt * * * and looked like * * * liquid soap;\u201d that normally a passenger rug is placed on the vestibule floor but it was not in use when he slipped and fell; that about fifteen minutes before, and also right after this occurrence, the vestibule had an \u201caccumulation of dirt, and silt, and moisture\u201d and that it was later cleaned up; that about two hours before plaintiff fell, the cleaning women had scrubbed the vestibule with a pail of water and soap solution; and that the weather was \u201chumid and warm that day.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b367-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>We think that evidence is sufficient for plaintiff\u2019s prima facie case. The District Court did not err in denying the motion for directed verdict and in submitting the case to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-4\"> Santa Fe does not argue that the verdict is excessive. This fact, and the fact that there is evidence to support the verdict, weakens Santa Fe\u2019s several contentions with respect to prejudicial conduct and rulings at the trial. Christian v. Hertz Corp., 313 F.2d 174 (7th Cir. 1963). We have considered all other contentions but shall discuss only those we deem necessary. Also, because appellant does not argue the verdict was excessive, we shall not consider contentions which bear only on the amount of damages. Chicago R. I. &amp; P. Ry. Co. v. Gunn, 112 Ark. 401, 166 S.W. 568 (1914).</p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">Plaintiff alleged negligence of Santa Fe in failure to provide a safe place to work, <em>i. e., </em>permitted the vestibule to become \u201cgrimy and slippery * * * by the presence of ice and other foreign substances * * Under Federal notice pleading,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> this allegation was adequate to accommodate testimony, by witnesses for both sides, and argument to the jury that a vestibule rug normally in use for passengers was not on the floor when plaintiff slipped. The same is true of testimony of the vestibule being \u201cwet from plain water.\u201d These were not new, surprising theories.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-8\">Santa Fe\u2019s steward testified that the vestibule had been dried up after plaintiff fell; and we cannot say the court committed prejudicial error in permitting plaintiff to testify about having heard at the time of injury a statement, \u201c * * * those lowdown rascals * * * they wiped the floor * * * and [the soles of] his shoes.\u201d As to testimony of similar statements by other witnesses, what error there may have been was harmless. And what argument was made upon the testimony of the quoted statement does not seem to us to have been prejudicial in the vigorously tried ease.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-12\">We have not been persuaded that in the trial of liability and damages together the claimed misconduct of plaintiff\u2019s attorney had \u201ca prevailing influence upon the jury\u201d to. Santa Fe\u2019s detriment. 3 Am.Jur. 607. And we cannot hold that any claimed errors are \u201cinconsistent with substantial justice.\u201d Rule 61, F.R. Civ.P.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b367-13\">We have considered, but deem it unnecessary to discuss, all other contentions made by appellant. We find no reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-14\">For the reasons given, the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b366-19\">. 45 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 51-60.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b367-9\">. As Mr. Justice Black stated in Conley v. Gibson, 355 U.S. 41, 47, 78 S.Ct. 99, 103, 2 L.Ed.2d 80 (1957), \u201c* * * all the Buies require is \u2018a short and plain statement of the claim\u2019 [citing Bu'le 8(a) (2) ] that will give the defendant fair notice of what the plaintiffs claim is and the grounds upon which it rests.\u201d See also 2 Moore, Federal Practice 1695-97 (2d ed. 1962).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b367-19\">. This rule technically is a \u201cmandate\u201d to District Courts, but Courts of Appeals \u201cgladly\u201d follow the rule as the best practice. 7 Moore, Federal Practice 1030 (2d ed. 1955).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b367-15\">SCHNACKENBERG, Circuit</author>\n<p id=\"ark-dedup-0\">Judge (dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b367-16\">Because plaintiff in this case recovered a verdict of $37,500, upon evidence showing a very doubtful basis for liability against the employer, and because of improper and prejudicial argument to the jury by plaintiff\u2019s counsel, over objection, which was unfair to defendant, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-17\">Plaintiff, a cook in the employ of defendant railway company, was in the yard in Chicago, on one of the sleeping cars being assembled for the Super Chief,, scheduled to leave Chicago at 6:30 P.M.,, August 15, 1959. The evidence shows, without contradiction, that it was customary for defendant to \u201cbring out a red carpet\u201d for the passengers just prior to loading at the Chicago depot. This carpet was placed on each of the vestibule <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>floors of the cars. Plaintiff came on duty before these carpets were laid on the day in question. He testified that he slipped on the floor of the vestibule of the sleeping car Regal Crest and sustained an injury to his right leg, for which he brought suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-4\">Then his attorney was permitted to argue to the jury that plaintiff was \u201ca working fellow\u201d and \u201cMaybe you just want to save the carpeting for the cash-paying, luxury-treated customers that get \u2022on and pay an extra fare, whatever it is, so that they can walk on the carpeting\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">His alleged poverty was again emphasized before the jury through examination by his lawyer who elicited information that plaintiff had spent \u201call the little money that I had\u201d, \u201csome of it was railroad fare for my wife whose mother was ill\u201d, followed quickly by a question which \u2022elicited this answer: \u201cWell, my pass rights were taken away from me.\u201d Although an objection to this last reference to the pass was sustained by the court, its effect on the jury was probably not erased thereby.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-6\">During the argument to the jury, plaintiff\u2019s counsel said: \u201cHe [the plaintiff] knows that he has a family to support and he starts thinking, especially \u2022after the first trip out.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b368-7\">An objection to the comment, brought \u201cthis response from plaintiff\u2019s attorney: \u201cI am sorry, his wife. He has got an eighteen-year-old son.\u201d However, in a pretrial deposition, plaintiff indicated that he had an illegitimate 18-year old daughter, who did not live with him.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-8\">Whether he had a family is immaterial in the case at bar. Its sole effect was to arouse sympathy for plaintiff and prejudice defendant, to the end that the jury might be influenced to find in favor of plaintiff, and to increase his award of damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-9\">While the record is repl\u00e9te with other instances of prejudice of this kind, the foregoing illustrations will suiflce.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-10\">I would reverse and remand for a new trial.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
