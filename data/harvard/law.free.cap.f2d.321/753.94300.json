See International Ladies\u2019 Garment Workers\u2019 U. v. N. L. R. B., 112 U.S.App.D.C. 30, 299 F.2d 114 (1962). The facts are set forth in detail in that opinion; but, briefly, the charge against Walls Manufacturing Company, Inc. was that it had violated Section 8(a) (1) of the National Labor Relations Act, as amended, by discharging an employee, Mrs. Mary Akey. This court, in remanding the ease to the Board, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b801-26\">\u201cIt will thus be seen that we agree with the Board\u2019s conclusion that Mrs. Akey\u2019s conduct with respect to the second letter was concerted activity, but disagree as to the manner in which the Board\u2019s general rule <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"754\">*754</page-number>as to employer knowledge was applied. One further issue remains, however \u2014 whether Mrs. Akey\u2019s conduct with respect to that letter was \u2018protected\u2019, a matter on which the Board expressly declined to rule. Whether an activity is protected or not depends not only on the wording and purposes of the Act, but on the precise nature and effect of the employee\u2019s conduct. The question is accordingly one for the Board to decide in the first instance, and we express no opinion on the subject at the present stage. No doubt, however, the Board will wish to consider whether Mrs. Akey\u2019s second letter contained false information, and, if so, whether the falsehoods were such as to remove the writing from any \u2018protected\u2019 status it might otherwise possess.\u201d 112 U.S.App.D.C. at 32, 299 F.2d at 116.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b802-4\">The Board reopened the case and, on re-examination of the record and evidence in the light of this court\u2019s opinion, filed its supplemental decision and order. By that decision and order the Board concluded that it was satisfied from the evidence, assuming the need for showing knowledge of the offense at the time of discharge, that \u201cat the time of the discharge interview the Respondent knew of the concerted nature of [the employee\u2019s] activity.\u201d The Board further found that there was \u201cno cogent evidence that the allegations were made with intent to falsify or maliciously injure the Respondent, that they were defamatory or insulting in character, or that they were manifestly destructive of discipline.\u201d The Board concluded that, notwithstanding the inaccuracy of any allegation, the activity was protected conduct within the meaning of Section 7 of the Act.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Thereupon, the Board ordered petitioner to cease and desist from certain violations of the Act and to reinstate the employee with back pay, and other affirmative action.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-7\">Petition to review, set aside and reverse the supplemental decision and order was duly filed; and the Board answered, and prayed enforcement.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-8\">While the matter is not free from doubt, and we might well have reached a view contrary to that of the Board, we cannot say, having in mind the narrow scope of our review, that the record as a whole does not support the Board\u2019s determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-9\">Accordingly, the petition for review will be denied, and the supplementary order will be enforced.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-10\">So ordered.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b802-5\">. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 157 (1958) : \u201cEmployees shall have the right to self-organization, to form, join, or assist labor organizations, to bargain collectively through representatives of their own choosing, and to engage in other concerted activities for the purpose of collective bargaining or other mutual aid or protection, and shall also have the right to refrain from any or all of such activities except to the extent that such right may be affected by an agreement requiring membership in a labor organization as a condition of employ-meht as authorized in section 158(a) (3) of this title.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
