The negative premise of this provision is that, with respect to businesses established prior to January 24, 1934, the Commissioners may not promulgate regulations forbidding the issuance of liquor licenses because they are near schools, colleges, universities, churches, or public institutions. This simple analysis provides the answer to this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-17\">The District of Columbia Alcoholic Beverage Control Board <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> issued a liquor license to RJM, Inc. RJM had previously purchased a restaurant business on the location in question, which is within 400 feet of three schools, the restaurant business having been established in, and continuously operated since, 1928. Appellants, residents in the area of the restaurant, opposed the issuance of the license before the Board and now ask reversal of the judgment of the District Court refusing to annul the order of the Board granting the license. Although they suggest various procedural errors in the proceedings before the Board, the main thrust of their attack on the Board order is that it was issued in violation of Regulation 2-103 promulgated pursuant to the Alcoholic Beverage Control Act, which regulation provides that: \u201cNo <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"756\">*756</page-number>license * * * shall be issued for anyplace of business within 400 feet of any public, private or parochial, primary, elementary, or high school, or any college, \u2022university, or church: * *</p>\n<p id=\"b804-4\">After full hearing, the Board found: '\u201cThat the evidence fully established that this restaurant business was established in 1928 and has operated since that time as a restaurant.\u201d Appellants admit that this finding is uncontroverted in the record. Since the business to which the liquor license in suit was issued was established prior to January 24,1934, the regulation on which appellants rely is inapplicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-5\">The procedural issues raised on appeal have been adequately, and we think properly, dealt with in the opinion of the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b803-11\">. Repeal of Prohibition became effective in the District of Columbia on this day.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b803-18\">.
