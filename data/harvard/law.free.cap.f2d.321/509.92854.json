Each defendant has .appealed. Their appeals challenge the sufficiency of the evidence to support the \u2022convictions and raise several points of law requiring discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-5\">In making its case the Government relied upon testimony of agents of the Federal Bureau of Narcotics. Neither defendant took the stand. The testimony \u2022.of the Government witnesses is substantially undisputed as to the substantive offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-6\">A. The Substantive Counts</p>\n<p id=\"b558-7\">Cimino\u2019s guilt of the two substantive offenses alleged in the indictment was so clearly established that a \u2022very brief statement of the testimony will suffice. In Brooklyn, on the morning of November 10, 1960, Cimino was introduced to Agent Avant by a \u201cspecial employee\u201d of the Federal Bureau of Narcotics by the name of Saul Scott, who was not produced as a witness. Cimino, Scott and Avant drove in the latter\u2019s automobile to Manhattan and on the way Avant began negotiations with Cimino for the purchase of a quarter kilo of heroin. \u2022Cimino said <em>he </em>would have to consult his -source, Joe Z; he added that he could not fix a price, but that it would probably be between $3,600 and $4,200. Avant never saw Joe Z but other agents identified him as D\u2019Ercole. Purchase of the beroin was completed in Manhattan between Avant and Cimino during the night of November 10. A second purchase of the same quantity of heroin, following a similar factual pattern, was completed between them on the night of November 22, 1960.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-8\">Whether the evidence as to D\u2019Ercole was insufficient, as he argues, to support his conviction on the substantive counts, we need not determine because a holding of insufficiency would be of little avail to him if his conviction on the conspiracy count is sustained, since the sentence on this count was also 20 years. However, it may be noted that the Avant-Cimino-D\u2019Ercole conversation discussed under the conspiracy count may well have been sufficient to establish that D\u2019Ercole was in a position of control and hence, an imputed participant in the sales. Cf. United States v. Moia, 2 Cir., 251 F.2d 255.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-10\">B. The Conspiracy Count</p>\n<p id=\"b558-11\">Count 3 of the indictment charges that from January 18, 1960 to the date of filing the indictment [September 5,1962] the defendants \u201cand others to the Grand Jury unknown\u201d unlawfully conspired to violate \u00a7\u00a7 173 and 174 of Title 21 United States Code. The alleged overt acts were (1) that Cimino met with D\u2019Ercole on November 10,1960; (2) that on the same date Cimino \u201cdelivered a quantity of narcotics\u201d;<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and (3) that on November 22, 1960 Cimino met with D\u2019Ercole.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-12\">Witnesses for the prosecution proved the meetings between Cimino and D\u2019Ercole on November 10 and 22 but no witness overheard their conversations or saw anything passed from one to the other. Their mere meeting was no evidence of their being conspirators; nor was Cimino\u2019s statement to Avant that Joe Z was \u201cthe source\u201d of the heroin sold by Cimino competent evidence against D\u2019Ercole. \u201cOtherwise, hearsay would lift itself by it own bootstraps-to the level of competent evidence.\u201d See Glasser v. United States, 315 U.S. 60, 74-76, 62 S.Ct. 457, 86 L.Ed. 680.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-13\">The evidence relied upon by the Government is an incident which occurred on December 7, 1960. At about noon on that date Avant and Cimino met at Benny\u2019s Luncheonette in Manhattan and negotiated for a third purchase which was never completed. Avant expressed a desire to meet Joe Z and Cimino suggested that he telephone Joe Z at LE 4-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>9197 at 3 o\u2019clock that afternoon; Avant made the call and it was answered by Cimino whose voice Avant recognized. Avant then asked to speak with Joe Z and a different voice replied \u201cThis is Joe Z\u201d and added \u201cGive Johnny [Cimino] the money as you have done previously on your other two purchases. Everything will be all right. The quality and quantity of. the stuff will be about the same. Later on we can meet and have dinner and discuss the price on future purchases.\u201d Agent Costa, who was surveilling the premises where LE 4-9197 was located, Gus\u2019 restaurant, testified that at about 3 P.M. on December 7,1960, he saw Cimino enter the telephone booth. D\u2019Er-cole then entered the booth. When D\u2019Er-cole came out Cimino reentered the booth.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-5\">Judge Bryan convicted both defendants on the conspiracy count. In so doing it is obvious that he believed Avant\u2019s testimony as to what D\u2019Ercole said on the telephone and Costa\u2019s testimony that D\u2019Ercole was using the telephone at the time Avant talked with the voice which said \u201cThis is Joe Z.\u201d The Avant-Cimino-D\u2019Ercole conversation was not hearsay. It was independent evidence \u2014 an admission from D\u2019Ereole\u2019s own lips \u2014 of his complicity in the transactions on November 10 and 22. Although it is true as D'Ercole argues that the trial judge had to make certain deductions from the proof, nevertheless Costa actually saw D\u2019Ercole enter the telephone booth when Cimino came out and saw Cimino re-enter after D\u2019Ercole left. This was sufficient to establish D\u2019Ercole as the owner of the voice. See United States v. Kahaner et al., 2 Cir., 317 F.2d 459 (April 25, 1963) footnote 4; 72 Harv.L.Kev. 920, 987.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-6\">C. Alleged Errors of Law</p>\n<p id=\"b559-7\">Several of the points raised on the appeal are asserted by both appellants. The first of these poses an interesting problem of alleged conflict between the \u201cJencks Act,\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3500, and the normal rule excluding evidence of a defendant\u2019s prior criminal record when he does not take the stand in his own defense or raise an issue as to his character. The problem arose early in the trial with respect to a document marked as Court\u2019s Exhibit 16 for Identification. This was a report made by Agent Costa, a witness for the prosecution, which the defendants asked to have produced under the Jencks Act. It contained <em>inter alia </em>a record of the defendants\u2019 prior criminal convictions. The trial judge read the Exhibit to determine its producibility under \u00a7 3500, and said that it contained matter which would have been grounds for a mistrial had it been called to the attention of a jury, but that he would not consider the non-evidentiary material but would decide the case \u201csolely on the evidence.\u201d Each defendant then moved for a mistrial. Their motions were denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-10\">The appellants contend that the trial court\u2019s examination of the Exhibit was an error which entitles them to a new trial. This claim is premised on the notion that even in a non-jury case, any judge sitting as trier of the facts, cannot fail to be biased by knowing of a defendant\u2019s prior criminal record.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> They suggest that such knowledge could have been avoided if the prosecutor had excised the prejudicial material before the Exhibit was handed to the judge for examination pursuant to \u00a7 3500. To require, or even to condone, selective disclosure to the court of statements requested under \u00a7 3500 would, in our opinion, run counter to^ the admonitions of this Court in United States v. Aviles, 2 Cir., 315 F.2d 186. Moreover, if it is to be presumed that a jury will pay no attention to evidence brought out and ordered stricken or to evidence which the jury is instructed to&gt; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>disregard, it is even more reasonable to trust a judge to ignore non-evidentiary matter. We hold that the motions for mistrial were properly denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-4\">Appellants also urge that it was error to try them while the Government informer, Saul Scott, was unavailable as a witness; D\u2019Ercole argues, in the \u2022alternative, that a continuance should have been granted to permit further \u2022search for Scott. No case of which we \u2022are aware has held that mere failure of production is reversible error, where diligent search for the special employee has 'been made. Roviaro v. United States, 353 U.S. 53, 77 S.Ct. 623, 1 L.Ed.2d 639, requires only that the Government identify its informant; the duty does not extend to production, Williams v. United States, 9 Cir., 273 F.2d 781, 795-796, cert. denied 362 U.S. 951, 80 S.Ct. 862, 4 L.Ed.2d 868; Eberhart v. United States, 9 Cir., 262 F.2d 421, 422. There was no error in proceeding to trial without the missing witness. The granting of a continuance is a matter of discretion, see, e. g., Smith v. United States, 10 Cir., 273 F.2d 462, 466, cert. denied 363 U.S. 846, 80 S.Ct. 1619, 4 L.Ed.2d 1729. We see no abuse of discretion in denial of the continuance.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-5\">Appellant Cimino contends that the indictment should have been dismissed for vagueness. The point is utterly without merit. See Brown v. United States, 9 Cir., 222 F.2d 293, 296, a prosecution brought under 173 and 174 of Title 21, where the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-6\">\u201c * * * where, as here, a statute creating an offense sets forth fully, directly, and expressly, all of the essential elements necessary to \u2022constitute the crime intended to be punished, it is sufficient if the indietment charges the offense in substantially the words of the statute.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b560-9\">Equally futile is Cimino\u2019s argument that the indictment was void because based on hearsay testimony of Agent Costa before the grand jury. No discussion is necessary. See United States v. Costello, 350 U.S. 359, 363, 76 S.Ct. 406, 100 L.Ed. 397.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-10\">Finally Cimino argues that Judge Bryan\u2019s general finding of guilt was insufficient. Rule 23(c) F.R.Crim.P. provides: \u201cIn a case tried without a jury the court shall make a general finding and shall in addition <em>on request </em>find the facts specially.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Cimino made no request for the special findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-11\">The judgments of conviction are affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b558-14\">. The only delivery proved was to Agent Avant who purchased heroin from Cimino on that date and on November 22,1960.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b559-8\">. Wigmore on Evidence \u00a7 194 appears to take this view, and was quoted to that effect by Cardoso, C. J., in People v. Zack-owitz, 254 N.Y. 192, 198, 172 N.E. 466, 468. The quotation is dictum, since Zackowitz involved a jury trial; and in any event a New York decision would not be controlling on this court in the case at bar. Nevertheless, the appellants do pose a real problem : efficient administration of \u00a7 3500 must be balanced against potential prejudice to defendants in non-jury cases.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b560-12\">WATERMAN, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"arg-dedup-0\">(concurring in part and dissenting in part).</p>\n<p id=\"b560-13\">Although I concur in the affirmance of Cimino\u2019s conviction, the appeal of D\u2019Er-cole raises questions which are not, in my view, answered by the majority opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-14\">The central question is whether there is sufficient evidence in the record before us to sustain D\u2019Ercole\u2019s conviction on the conspiracy count in the ihdictment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> That question raises, in turn, the issue of whether the Government\u2019s failure to produce the government informer, Saul Sapp, alias Scott, as a potential defense witness at the time of trial, or to call Sapp as a government witness, should materially affect the consideration of the central question.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-15\">The events covered by the indictment occurred on three separate days in 1960: November 10, November 22, and December 7. On November 10, Sapp introduced <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>Narcotics Agent Myron Avant to appellant Cimino for the first time. During the course of negotiations with Avant about the purchase of a quarter kilo of heroin, Cimino stated that his source of supply was a person named \u201cJosie\u201d (or \u201cJoe Z\u201d). Later that day, before the delivery of the heroin to Avant, Cimino was twice seen talking to D\u2019Ercole and the informer Sapp.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-5\">On November 22, Avant made a second purchase of heroin from Cimino. Again \u201cJosie\u201d was said by Cimino to be the source of supply and the person with whom he would have to make arrangements for delivery. Again Cimino and Sapp were seen engaged in conversations with D\u2019Ercole.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-6\">On December 7, Avant began negotiations with Cimino for a third purchase of narcotics which was never completed. When Avant asked to meet \u201cJosie,\u201d he was given a telephone number to call at three P.M. When Avant called at the appointed time, a voice which he recognized to be that of Cimino answered. After a brief conversation Agent Avant asked to speak to Josie. Thereafter a voice said \u201cThis is Josie. Give Johnny the money as you have done previously on your other two purchases. Everything will be all right. The quantity and quality of the stuff will be the same. Later on we can meet and have dinner and discuss the price on future purchases.\u201d Avant did not recognize the voice. The promised meeting never took place.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-7\">In order to establish D\u2019Ercole\u2019s participation in the criminal conspiracy, therefore, the Government was required to rely exclusively upon the testimony of a second agent, David W. Costa, who testified that at approximately 3:00 P.M. on December 7,1960, he was standing on the south side of 116th Street between First and Pleasant Avenues. He thereupon observed Cimino and D\u2019Ereole enter Guss\u2019s Luncheonette on the north side of the street and walk to the rear of the building, where Cimino entered a phone booth. When Cimino came out of the booth, according to Agent Costa\u2019s testimony, D\u2019Ercole entered, remained a few minutes, and came out. Cimino then returned to the phone booth for a few moments, and thereafter walked out of the luncheonette with D\u2019Ercole. The Agent further testified that the number of the telephone in the booth which appellants entered was the same one which Agent Avant had been given for purposes of contacting \u201cJosie\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-11\">Upon this testimony D\u2019Ercole is found to be the mysterious \u201cJosie,\u201d is convicted, and receives a 20-year prison sentence. Costa testified that he fixed the time when Cimino and D\u2019Ercole were in Guss\u2019s Luncheonette as only \u201capproximately\u201d at 3 P.M. on December 7. Appellants\u2019 entry into the luncheonette and telephone booth could be significant, however, only if it occurred simultaneously with Avant\u2019s telephone call. Most of Costa\u2019s observations were made from the south side of 116th Street which, he testified, was approximately 60 feet wide between First and Pleasant Avenues. Costa, then, if he observed appellants\u2019 activities from the south side of 116th Street, had to observe them through the closed glass front door of the luncheonette, which was located on the north side of the street, while appellants were at the back of the luncheonette and, at least for a time, inside one of the two telephone booths.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Costa was, of course, unable to overhear any conversation either of the appellants may have had while in the telephone booth. Indeed, he could not determine whether they initiated or received any telephone call at all during the time they were there.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>The above constitutes the Government\u2019s evidence against D\u2019Ercole, and, viewing it in its most favorable light, there remain limitations upon the accuracy of human observation<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and upon the validity of inferences from circumstantial evidence which occur to me to be too perilous to be ignored when a twenty-year prison sentence is at stake.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-4\">The standard of appellate review is not, of course, the same as that to be applied by a trial judge. D\u2019ErcoIe\u2019s conviction must be affirmed unless it was \u201cclearly erroneous.\u201d Even by this generous standard, however, my brothers will agree, I believe, that, at best, the evidence supporting D\u2019ErcoIe\u2019s guilt was marginal. Where my brothers and I may disagree is in the inference to be drawn, if any, from the Government\u2019s failure to produce, at the time of the trial below, or to call as a witness, Saul Sapp, the \u201cspecial employee.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b562-5\">During the trial the Government maintained that although it was obliged to divulge the name of its informer, Ro-viaro v. United States, 353 U.S. 53, <em>77 </em>S.Ct. 623, 1 L.Ed.2d 639 (1957), it had no duty to produce him as a potential witness for the defense or \u201cto place on the witness stand every person with some knowledge of the circumstances.\u201d The trial judge did not disagree with this interpretation of the government\u2019s obligations. Nevertheless, because of the evident importance of the informer\u2019s possible testimony, Judge Bryan repeatedly requested the Government to aid defense counsel in locating Sapp and granted several continuances for that purpose. The judge\u2019s repeated requests that the Government cooperate in this respect were consistent, I believe, with the spirit of Roviaro, though possibly not required by its letter.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-9\">Seldom can government informers be expected to be pillars of stability in their communities. If the common understanding is to be credited they are often narcotic addicts or petty criminals whose cooperation with law enforcement officials is not entirely voluntary. Under these circumstances, to give defendants the name (perhaps, as here, one of several aliases) of the Government\u2019s informer, without revealing the further information about the informer which the Government may be expected to possess, and without aiding defense counsel to find the potential witness, would only further expose the sharp disadvantages which a defendant often faces in preparing his defense to a criminal prosecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-10\">Concern with the debatable and debated extent of the Government\u2019s obligations under the Roviaro doctrine obscured at the trial below what, in my view, was the primary effect of the Government\u2019s failure to call Sapp as a witness for the prosecution.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> That effect does not derive from Roviaro, but from a much older evi-dentiary rule, the rule concerned with the failure of a party to produce at trial evidence available to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>The Narcotics Agents charged with the investigation of the ease appear to have been doubtful, at least initially, concerning the sufficiency of their evidence against appellants. The events they testified to occurred in November and December of 1960. Cimino was not arrested until August of 1962, nearly two years later. D\u2019Ereole was not arrested until sixteen days after the arrest of Cimino. During the intervening period Cimino was repeatedly urged to \u201ccooperate with the Government,\u201d presumably in giving direct evidence to support the Government\u2019s circumstantial case against D\u2019Er-cole.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">In light of these facts it is curious that no consideration appears to have been given by the Government to calling the government informer as a witness for the prosecution. Except for the defendants themselves, Sapp was the sole witness who could have given direct testimony of D\u2019Ercole\u2019s guilt with respect to either the substantive or conspiracy counts of the indictment. According to the testimony of Agents Avant and Costa, Sapp was present during nearly every conversation between Cimino and D\u2019Ercole on November 10 and November 22 when the sale of narcotics was allegedly being arranged or consummated. Testimony from Sapp (provided that it was confirmatory of the inferences which the prosecution sought to draw) would have transformed a case of questionable evidentiary sufficiency into a prosecution establishing D\u2019Ercole\u2019s guilt beyond any peradventure of doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-6\">Assuming that Sapp was within at least the \u201cconstructive\u201d power of the Government to call as a witness, its failure to do so and its reliance upon testimony of less probative weight, raised a presumption that the informer\u2019s testimony would have been unfavorable to the Government\u2019s case. 2 Wigmore, Evidence \u00a7\u00a7 285, 286 (1940 ed.) and the many cases cited therein; United States v. Di Re, 332 U.S. 581, 593, 68 S.Ct. 222, 92 L.Ed. 210 (1948); Wesson v. United States, 8 Cir., 172 F.2d 931, 936; Napper v. Rice, 127 W.Va. 157, 32 S.E.2d 41, 45 (1944); see United States v. Conforti, 200 F.2d 365 (7 Cir. 1953). Even if the conviction of D\u2019Ercole was not clearly erroneous when based upon the marginal evidence of Agents Costa and Avant, provided that testimony had been the only available testimony, I submit that the conviction cannot withstand an unrebut-ted presumption that the testimony of the only non-defendant fully apprised of the facts in issue would have been unfavorable to the prosecution.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Whether D\u2019Ercole\u2019s conviction may be affirmed turns, in my view, upon the question of whether Sapp was within the Government\u2019s power to the extent that it could call him as a witness at the trial below. It is to that question that I now turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-9\">The first identification of the government informer was secured by defense counsel in the course of his cross-examination of Agent Costa:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-10\">\u201cQ. Now, who was this special employee you were assigned to? A. Saul Scott.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-11\">\u201cQ. Is that his name, would you know? A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-12\">\u201cQ. What is his address? ******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-13\">\u201cA. I don\u2019t know his present address.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-14\">\u201cQ. Did you know the address at that time? A. In November of \u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AXZ\">\u201cQ. In November of 1960. A. I didn\u2019t know his address at that time, no, sir.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b563-15\">By further cross-examination of Agent Costa, however, it was revealed that \u201cSaul Scott\u201d was an alias for Saul Sapp and that over a period of many months Sapp had been contacted by Costa at room 405 in the Manhattan Towers <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>Hotel. Under lengthy cross-examination Costa further revealed that Sapp was present at the time of Cimino\u2019s arrest, and that Costa, presumably after the arrest and indictment of both appellants, had paid the informer $200 at \u201cthe end of the month of August or early September\u201d of 1962. During September 1962, Costa again contacted Sapp at the Manhattan Towers Hotel; and in October, shortly before the trial below, Sapp attempted unsuccessf ully to contact Costa at the latter\u2019s office.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-4\">Upon redirect examination by government counsel, Costa testified that he had made attempts to contact Sapp from the latter part of September until the time of trial, but that the informer could not be reached at the bars he previously had frequented and that he was \u201cno longer at the Manhattan Towers Hotel.\u201d These efforts to locate the informer were made, Costa testified, at the request of government counsel \u201cin case the defense wanted him as a witness at the trial.\u201d The record is silent, however, as to any attempts by Costa or other government agents, during their earlier contacts with Sapp, to advise the informer that his testimony would be needed or to insure his availability at the forthcoming trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-5\">Upon this showing it is too clear for doubt, I believe, that the Government did not at any time, including those periods when the informer was under its direct control, intend to call Sapp as a witness for the prosecution. The informer\u2019s name was absent from a list of suggested witnesses prepared by narcotics agents for the United States Attorney\u2019s office despite the fact that the agents were in continuous contact with Sapp at the time the list was prepared. The Assistant United States Attorney in charge of the case never spoke with Sapp and suggested that he be located, shortly before trial, only \u201cin case the defense wanted him as a witness.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b564-6\">These facts, taken by themselves, raise the presumption that the testimony of the informer would have been unfavorable to the Government\u2019s case. Moreover, that presumption gains some support from further events surrounding the search for Sapp that was reported to the judge as having been made during the course of the trial and prior to the sentencing of appellants.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-10\">After the cross-examination of Agent Costa, discussed above, Judge Bryan, on the morning of Friday, November 16, 1962, adjourned the trial until the following Monday with the request that the Government \u201cgive [defense counsel] such reasonable assistance as they can\u201d in locating Sapp. On Monday an Assistant United States Attorney reported to the court that Agent Costa had sought to locate the informer on Friday and Saturday at the Manhattan Towers Hotel, and at known haunts elsewhere, but without success. Counsel for the defense then reported that upon simple inquiry at the Manhattan Towers Hotel it was learned that Sapp still resided in room 405, under the name \u201cS. Fields.\u201d Upon voir dire examination, the hotel manager testified that Sapp first checked into the hotel on October 12,1961, under the name of S. Scott; that the same person had lived in room 405, as S. Fields, since the beginning of 1962; that Sapp\u2019s room charge for 405 had been paid within the past week; and that two telephone calls from the room had been made on November 17, five days after the beginning of the trial below. Each of these assertions was supported by hotel records offered in evidence. Agent Costa was then examined by defense counsel and admitted that although he had gone to room 405 and knocked on the door during the weekend search he had left no message for the informer and had made no inquiries at the hotel concerning his whereabouts.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-11\">Whether these events reflect mere ineptitude on the part of the narcotics agents charged with finding t]je informer, or whether they demonstrate a disinterest or unwillingness to find him, cannot be determined on the record before us.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> I am unable to believe, however, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>that with the investigative facilities available to the Government in the Southern District of New York, this informer (who obligingly continued to live in an identified hotel room until at least five days after the commencement of the trial below) could not have been produced as a Government witness had the Government diligently sought to produce him. I conclude, therefore, that Sapp was under sufficient Government control during relevant periods so that failure to produce him, the witness best able to testify to D\u2019Ercole\u2019s guilt or innocence, raised the presumption, not rebutted below, that the informer\u2019s testimony would have been unfavorable to the Government\u2019s cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-5\">It may be suggested that the Government\u2019s reluctance to produce informers in prosecutions such as this does not arise from a fear of what they will say as witnesses, but from a fear that they will be subjected to threats and reprisals by the defendants whose prosecutions they have facilitated. Eoviaro commands, however, that here the informer\u2019s name be divulged to the defense; and, as here, defendants may be expected to connect the informer\u2019s name with a person with whom they have had dealings, whether those dealings were criminal or not. The subsequent physical production of the informer in the court room would seem to create no additional risks to those already existent.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-6\">It may further be suggested that a rule of evidence requiring the testimony of informers in criminal trials will adversely affect the entire informer system upon which the Government appears so heavily to rely in narcotics cases. I do not doubt that informers may be expected to resist any loss of the anonymity within which they operate. The evidentiary presumption which I believe to be applicable to this case, however, only arises in a limited few cases, \u2014 those cases where the informer is quite obviously better able to testify to the facts in issue than are alternative Government witnesses. Moreover, the Government\u2019s alternative evidence may often be, as in the case of appellant Cimino, sufficiently strong to withstand any unfavorable inference created by a failure to call the informer.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-12\">I have great respect for the trial judge below. The record is replete with his efforts to assure to both defendants the fair trial that they were entitled to have under the rule that does not require the prosecution to produce in court every person having knowledge of the alleged criminal acts. Moreover, the record demonstrates that continuances were granted in order to apprehend Sapp and have him in court.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-13\">Nevertheless, for the reasons advanced above, I would reverse the conviction of D\u2019Ercole and remand the case with instructions to hold D\u2019Ercole\u2019s case upon the present record open for a further period of time, at least three months from the date of remand, within which the Government is to produce Saul Sapp so that he may testify and be examined under oath as to his knowledge of D\u2019Er-cole\u2019s alleged participation in the activities of November and December 1960. Should Sapp not be so produced, unless his production is prevented by believable circumstances superior to governmental power, or prevented by proven deliberate interferences by defendant, D\u2019Ercole should be acquitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-14\">This unusual disposition, impossible in a jury case, but quite possible in a case heard by the court sitting without jury, seems to me to be required if justice is to be done both to the Government and to the defendant. The courtroom shyness of this particular special employee has been the subject of discussion by our court heretofore, see United States v. Glaze, 313 F.2d 757 (2 Cir. 1963), where <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>he appears under his alias of \u201cSaul Scott,\u201d the designation adopted by my colleagues in the majority opinion. I believe it time to have this shyness overcome.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b560-7\">. The majority opinion does not reach the issue of D\u2019Ercole\u2019s guilt under the substantive counts of the indictment. Were it to do so, I submit that his conviction on these counts could not stand. The counts are based upon Avant\u2019s purchases of narcotics on November 10 and 22, 1962. On neither day were any conversations overheard between Cimino and D\u2019Er-cole; nor did any witness see D\u2019Ercole in possession of narcotics or D\u2019Ercole pass anything to Cimino. See United States v. Jones, 308 F.2d 26 (2 Cir. 1962) ; United States v. Hernandez, 290 F.2d 86 (2 Cir. 1961) ; United States v. Santore, 290 F.2d 51, 76 (2 Cir. 1960) ; and Hernandez v. United States, 300 F.2d 114 (9 Cir. 1962).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b561-8\">. Upon cross-examination Costa stated, for the first time, that while appellants were in the luncheonette he crossed 116th Street, looked through the closed glass door for \u201cfive seconds at the most,\u201d then returned to his post on the south side of the street. No explanation was given as to which appellant was in a phone booth during this five second period, nor are we told which of the events, previously recounted on direct examination, occurred while Costa\u2019s back was to the luncheonette as he returned to the south side of the street</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b562-6\">. When, during cross-examination, Agent Costa was questioned about occasional discrepancies between Ms testimony of events in 1960 and his \u201cdaily reports,\u201d made within a few days of the events, he readily conceded that the reports must be correct and the testimony wrong because he was testifying \u201cnearly two years after\u201d the events in question. Costa\u2019s reliance upon his reports rather than independent memory, however, raises the question whether the reports, themselves, were confined to the agent\u2019s personal observations. During his lengthy testimony before the Grand Jury, Costa answered many questions as if from personal observation. Upon cross-examination at trial, however, it was revealed that his testimony before the Grand Jury was based upon composite reports of the observations of various narcotics agents concerned with the case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b562-12\">. Exclusive attention to Roviaro may also explain the Government\u2019s contention that D\u2019Ercole waived his objections with respect to the informer by failing to join with Oimino in demanding Sapp\u2019s presence at the trial. Although this failure may have worked a waiver of D\u2019ErcoIe\u2019s rights under Roviaro, defendants in criminal cases need not object to the failure of the Government to establish a <em>prima facie </em>case against them prior to moving for acquittal for lack of having so established one.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b563-7\">. Though not applicable here, there sometimes may be reasons, as discussed in this opinion infra, that would justify protection for \u201cspecial employees,\u201d particularly in narcotics cases. Moreover, where proof of guilt, even though circumstantial, is strong, (unlike this D\u2019Ercole case) a faceless informer would not need to be produced as a government witness.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b564-7\">. The trial judge credited the government agents with good faith in making their search. Because of his concern solely with defendants\u2019 right to know, under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>Roviaro, the identity of the informer, however, the judge drew no conclusion from the Government\u2019s failure to insure Sapp\u2019s availability for trial during the period he was unquestionably under its control. Moreover, he viewed the Government\u2019s subsequent activities in searching for the informer as gratuitous government cooperation with defense counsel in locating a potential <em>defense </em>witness.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
