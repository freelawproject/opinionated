BROWN, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"ANi\">This case deals with a secondary boycott under the 1959 Landrum-Griffin Amendments<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> to the Act. We hold that the consumer picket line constitutes a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>violation of \u00a7 8(b) (4) (i) and (ii).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We also hold that in some particulars the order should be made more precise. The result is that we sustain the Board\u2019s petition to enforce, Perfection\u2019s petition to reverse the order denying relief under \u00a7 (i) and to make the order more specific, and deny the Union\u2019s petition to set aside the order adjudging a violation of \u00a7 (ii). The case has a long and tortuous history. Begun in 1958 and now in its fifth year after three decisions by the Labor Board and two by Courts of Appeals, it still has life thanks, in no small measure, to intervening legislative changes. Perfection <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> is the primary employer. Subsequent to the designation of the Union <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> as the bargaining representative of its employees, Perfection and the Union engaged in extensive bargaining negotiations which lasted from July to October 1958. On October 14, 1958, the Union called a strike in support of its demands.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-5\">Perfection was able to continue its operations. It undertook to make deliveries to a number of retail furniture stores in the Birmingham area. Union representatives requested managers of the various retail stores to stop receiving or buying Perfection products. When such requests failed, the Unions immediately placed pickets at the entrances of those stores refusing to cease doing business with Perfection. This picketing continued until it was enjoined December 9, 1958, by an order under \u00a7 10(l), 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 160(l) pending action by the Board. This injunction was affirmed by this Court. Retail, Wholesale &amp; Department Store Union, AFL-CIO v. Rains, 5 Cir., April 30, 1959, 266 F.2d 503. In December 1959, the Board issued its decision finding that the Union\u2019s picketing had violated \u00a7 8(b) (4) (A) of the 1947 Act. 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 158(b) (4) (A). United Wholesale and Warehouse Employees, Local 261, 125 NLRB 520. The \u00a7 10(l) injunction expiring by its own terms, the Union, although it had previously formally disclaimed any interest in further representing the employees, nevertheless resumed picketing of the same retail stores on March 10, 1960. Presumably it desired to test the 1959 Amendments. It is upon this picketing that the Board\u2019s order now before this Court is based. Within a few months the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia by a divided court set aside the Board order finding the 1958 picketing to be an unfair labor practice. United Wholesale &amp; Warehouse Employees, Local 261 v. N. L. R. B., July 7, 1960, 108 U.S.App.D.C. 341, 282 F.2d 824. The Court of Appeals rejected the Board\u2019s conclusion \u201cthat the picketing activity had as its necessary effect the inducing and encouraging of employees to engage in a work stoppage.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b663-12\">On the basis of charges filed by Perfection, the Board issued a complaint alleging violations by the Union of \u00a7 8 (b) (4) (i) and (ii) (B). The parties waived a hearing and agreed to submit the case to the Board on stipulated facts which also included the entire record in the original \u00a7 10 (l) injunction proeeed-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>ing. On December 28, 1960, the Board issued its order, 129 NLRB 1014, holding that the 1960 picketing violated both \u00a7\u00a7 (i) and (ii). Perfection petitioned for review under \u00a7 10(e) on the ground that the provisions of the cease and desist order, stated as they were in statutory language, were too vague and indefinite upon which to secure effective compliance through contempt or other coercive sanctions.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> On August 17, 1961, the Board filed a motion in this Court for leave to modify its decision on the ground that by subsequent decision after a change of its membership the Board had in a subsequent case <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> held that there was no \u00a7 (i) violation. We denied the motion to modify but remanded the proceedings to the Board for limited reconsideration and filing of an amended or supplemental order meanwhile retaining jurisdiction of the subject matter. Following this, on December 4, 1961, the Board issued a supplemental decision and amended order finding no \u00a7 (i) violation. 134 NLRB 99. The result is that the order is now confined to a violation of \u00a7 (ii). The Board and Perfection seek enforcement of that order. The Union seeks denial of enforcement. Perfection seeks, in effect, a reinstatement of the finding of a \u00a7 (i) violation and both Board and Union oppose this. Perfection, opposed by both Board and Union, further attacks the vagueness of the order as to either one or both of \u00a7 (i) and (ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b664-3\">By stipulation the record upon which the Board acted included the testimony in the 1958 \u00a7 10 (l) injunction proceedings. This record showed that Union representatives had stated in various ways to managers of a number of retail furniture stores that they were going to \u201cpicket the stores and try to stop the trucks that was coming in from Perfection.\u201d When a store manager declined to cease purchasing Perfection merchandise, pickets shortly appeared. At one store, due to confusion in similar names, the pickets were withdrawn when the Union was assured that Perfection merchandise would not be sold. This assurance was enough for the Union to conclude that the retailer\u2019s conduct would not have \u201cviolated the picket line.\u201d Further, at one store (Willoughby) pickets loudly shouted about \u201cjunk in the [show] window that is made by scab labor\u201d and when Willoughby remonstrated about this, the picket became harsh and impudent resulting in a further exchange of harsh words between the picket and another employee. On another occasion at Willoughby\u2019s, there was repeated inquiry as to the home address of a servant of Willoughby\u2019s as she crossed the picket line. On another occasion at Ross Black Furniture Company, pickets became loud and boisterous shouting several times they \u201cwould never cross a picket line, even to pay a bill, it\u2019s a good excuse not to pay it.\u201d These statements were made in the hearing of one or more employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-7\">Though the evidence did not show any picketing of delivery entrances as such, or actual interference with deliveries, the record is clear that the presence of the pickets was known to all employees. Some employees of the retail stores regularly left before the pickets. Employees could see the picket signs through windows and doors. Many employees customarily went in and out of the front entrances of the stores all throughout the day for coffee, lunch, errands and the like. Many came to and left work customarily through the front entrances. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>The sign carried by the pickets bore this legend in large letters:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b665-4\">\u201cProducts made by Perfection Mattress and Spring Company are made by nonunion labor. As a consumer please do not buy them. Local 261, AFL-CIO.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b665-5\">In addition to the \u00a7 10 (J) evidence, further facts concerning the picketing which resumed March 10, 1960, were stipulated. \u201cIn furtherance of its dispute with Perfection,\u201d the Union \u201cpicketed at the * * retail stores in * * * Birmingham, at entrances commonly used by customers and some employees.\u201d Such \u201cpicketing was peaceful * * * and was limited to not more than one picket at any one time * * * \u201d who \u201c * * * was on the public sidewalk in front of the store and carried a picket sign * * \u201d which was identical to the 1958 sign except it was prefaced by the words \u201cTo the Consuming Public \u2014 -.\u201d The pickets arrived after and left before the times store employees normally arrived or departed. Pickets were not placed at the service or delivery entrances. But \u201cemployees of the stores could see, and some saw, the picket sign from inside the stores, and also when, as some employees did, such employees used the public entrances * * * to enter or leave in the course of a day.\u201d No request was made of truck drivers or delivery men to refuse to make deliveries \u201cand no such employee refused to make any such delivery.\u201d Since December 1958 no appeal other than by picketing has been made by the Union \u201cdirectly to employees of the retail stores, or any other person or persons, including the retail store employers handling retail products of Perfection.\u201d There \u201chas been no work stoppage at any time * * * by employees of\u201d the \u201cretail stores\u201d being picketed and \u201cno employee of the stores quit work or indicated any inclination or intention to do so, or to refuse to handle Perfection-made products as a result of or during the picketing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b665-11\">It is crystal clear that the <em>object </em>of the picketing was one proscribed by subsection (B). As the stipulation categorically states, the picketing was \u201cin furtherance of [the Union\u2019s] dispute with Perfection.\u201d The Union first sought to obtain an agreement from the retail stores not to handle Perfection\u2019s goods and failing in this, picket lines were immediately established and thereafter maintained. The only issues in the case, therefore, relate to the legality of the <em>means </em>used by the Union in its effort to force a cessation of business between the neutral retail stores and Perfection. Whatever doubts there might be as to \u00a7 (i), none exists as to \u00a7 (ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b665-12\">Consumer picketing at the premises of neutral secondary employers is clearly condemned by \u00a7 (ii). This sub-paragraph was added in 1959 to close a major loophole. While \u00a7 8(b) (4) of the Taft-Hartley Act prohibited inducing and encouraging the \u201cemployees\u201d of a neutral employer, the Board and Courts had held that this did not prevent a union from exerting coercive pressures directly on the neutral employer. Consequently, unions were free to use the effective weapon of the secondary consumer picket line to coerce the neutral retail store to discontinue doing business with the primary employer.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b665-13\"> The legislative history of the 1959 Amendments is convincing that where the object of the consumer picket line is to force the neutral to cease doing business with another, this action is \u201cto threaten, coerce, or restrain * * \u201d the neutral contrary to \u00a7 (ii). President Eisenhower strongly recommended amendments to the Taft-Hartley Act to prohibit \u201cthe direct coercion of employers to cease or agree to cease doing business with other persons * * I Leg. Hist. 80-82. In support of this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>the Secretary of Labor characterized direct coercion of employers as having an effect \u201cno less damaging upon employers and employees and no less contrary to the public interest than is the type of secondary activity presently prohibited * * * <em>\u00bb </em>jn the pressure is put on employees, not secondary employers. II Leg. Hist. 990, 994. This was also reflected by strong protests against inadequacies of earlier legislative proposals. I Leg. Hist. 397, 475. Terminology eventually enacted as \u00a7 (ii), described as \u201cthe secondary boycott provisions of\u201d the administration\u2019s bill, was stated by a co-sponsor to have \u201cthe effect\u201d of closing the \u201cloopholes which permit unions to instigate effective secondary boycotts\u201d by threats or coercion against the secondary employer or his supervisory personnel. II Leg. Hist. 989. It is clear from the numerous legislative exchanges that Congress intended the words \u201cthreaten, coerce, or restrain\u201d to prohibit peaceful consumer picketing at the site of the secondary retail employer. Thus \u201cthe picketing of customer entrances to retail stores selling goods manufactured by a concern under strike\u201d when \u201cthe purpose of the picketing is to coerce or restrain the employer of the [secondary] establishment * * * \u201d would be covered by the Landrum-Grif-fin Bill and \u201csuch a boycott could be stopped.\u201d II Leg. Hist. 1615. See also II Leg. Hist. 1037 and 1426.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-6\">There is also internal evidence in the structure of the Amendments to show that Congress had picketing, as such, clearly in mind. Thus the so-called publicity proviso of \u00a7 8(b) (4) declares that for purposes of paragraph (4) \u201cnothing contained in such paragraph shall be construed to prohibit publicity, <em>other than picketing, </em>for the purpose of truthfully advising the public, including consumers * * * that a product * * \u201d is produced by a primary employer with whom the union has a dispute. Of this the then Senator Kennedy explained, \u201cWe were not able to persuade the House conferees to permit picketing in front of that secondary shop, but we were able to persuade them to agree that the union shall be free to conduct informational activity short of picketing.\u201d II Leg. Hist. 1431-1432; and see Leg. Hist. 1822, 1843, 1857.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-8\">To this the Union makes a basic response. It urges that for consumer picketing to come within the language \u201cto threaten, coerce or restrain\u201d it must be shown to do so in fact in the particular case. This conclusion is required, so it argues, because otherwise the section would be an unconstitutional deprivation of First Amendment free speech. A part of this argument seems to be that had Congress meant to outlaw consumer picketing, it would have done so in explicit terms since in the proviso to \u00a7 8(a) (4) and in \u00a7 8(b) (7), Congress legislated in terms of picketing. This latter contention is without substance and may be quickly disposed of. In the first place, \u00a7 8(b) (7) is intentionally limited to picketing, whereas \u00a7 8(b) (4) (ii) is not. Likewise where the object is that condemned in \u00a7 (ii) (B), it is obvious that peaceful picketing is outlawed as a means employed \u201cto induce or encourage\u201d any employee to engage in a strike or refusal to perform services under \u00a7 (i).</p>\n<p id=\"b666-9\">On the basic objection the Union recognizes that consumer picketing might constitute the prohibited threat, coercion or restraint. But by emphasis on Representative Griffin\u2019s explanation that the \u201ccoercion [made] unlawful\u201d by \u00a7 (ii) is \u201ceconomic retaliation\u201d against the secondary employer \u201cin order to force him to cease doing business with a primary employer,\u201d II Leg. Hist. 1523 (I), and Senator Goldwater\u2019s statements that the proposed amendment would make \u201csuch picketing * * * illegal * * * \u201d if carried on \u201cfor the purpose of inducing consumers not to patronize company B (the secondary employer) * * II Leg. Hist. 1857(2), the Union\u2019s position is that there is no economic threat or coercion unless consumers are urged not to patronize the secondary employer at all. Conversely, the argument runs, consumer picketing urging customers not to purchase the goods of the primary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>employer subjects the secondary employer to none of the prohibited pressures. The Union finds considerable support for this approach in the decision of the District of Columbia Court of Appeals in Fruit &amp; Vegetable Packers <em>&amp; </em>Warehousemen v. N. L. R. B., D.C.Cir., 1962, 308 F.2d 311.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> That Court first recognized that the Board\u2019s view that the \u00a7 8(b) (4) proviso reflects the draftsman\u2019s assumption that in the absence of the proviso all secondary publicity would be banned \u201cbecause it necessarily threatens, coerces or restrains\u201d a neutral employer \u201ccan be squared with the statutory language.\u201d But it then concluded that this was \u201ca less plausible reading of the statute.\u201d On this the Court reached the conclusion that \u201cthe most plausible reading\u201d of \u00a7 (ii) is that it \u201coutlaws only such conduct (including picketing) as in fact threatens, coerces or restrains secondary employers.\u201d 308 F.2d 311, 315. As thus construed, the statute \u201ccondemns not picketing as such, but the use of threats, coercion and restraint to achieve specified objectives. * * * \u201d Consequently, since in that ease \u201cthere was no work stoppage, no interruption of deliveries, no violence or threat of violence\u201d and there was no showing that the picketing \u201ccaused or was likely to cause substantial economic injury\u201d to the secondary employer, or that \u201cconsumers felt \u2018coerced\u2019 by\u201d the presence of the pickets, the cease and desist order was set aside. 308 F.2d 311, 317, 318.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-5\">We cannot accept these economic or legal contentions of the Union, and in rejecting them we also decline, with great deference, to follow Fruit &amp; Vegetable Packers &amp; Warehouse v. N. L. R. B. supra. Only a brief statement of our reasons is required.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-6\"> At the very outset we think the judgment of the coercive, restraining, threatening effect of certain activities is one made by Congress in its determination of the underlying public policy. In legislating with respect to secondary boycotts, Congress was aware that the most vivid and spectacular weapon is the picket line. Since the purpose of the proposed Amendments was to protect secondary <em>employers </em>and not merely <em>employees </em>of secondary employers, it was evident that the consumer picketing was one of the most likely weapons which had been and would be employed. Through its various committees and in extensive hearings on many phases of labor problems, Congress was aware of the power generated against a neutral by the presence of a picket line. The effect of this picket line was twofold. First, it subjected a neutral to possibly devastating effects as a result of a controversy in which he had no real part. But equally important, it subjected the primary employer to economic forces and pressures which Congress declared had a disruptive effect in the relations between an employer and his own employees in the collective bargaining process. It is a mistake, in our judgment to assume as does the District of Columbia decision, that the secondary employer was the sole object of congressional protection. To the contrary, in the legislative development and in the operative effect of the Act, it is evident that Congress made a fundamental judgment as a part of its basic labor policy. Congress determined that in bargaining with representatives of their own employees, it was undesirable for primary employers to be subjected to cyclonic economic pressures through the loss of business brought about through coercive actions directed by the union toward persons through whom one\u2019s goods are sold or distributed. The important factor, of course, is the element of coercion against the neutral. For the Amendments recognize that under some circumstances there may be a lawful, voluntary, cessation of business. But the final effect of \u00a7 (ii) is to relieve both the neutral, secondary employer as well as the primary employer of the pressures generated through such coercive action.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-8\">It is at this point that the Union\u2019s economic theory breaks down. It <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>seems to assume that while a consumer picketing urging a <em>complete </em>boycott would be prohibited, this consequence does not attach if the plea is confined merely to the products of the primary employer. This is fallacious on at least two grounds. Perhaps the foremost is the damaging effect of any picket line posted in front of any retail establishment in the contemporary world of the highly developed organized trade unionist movement.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Even more directly, a plea not to buy a particular product is in effect a plea not to trade with the secondary employer at all. The secondary employer as a merchant may determine, for example, that to afford to his customers appliances or products which will give the best service at the least cost, the self-interests of the secondary employer in generating good will for future business will be best served by stocking the line of a particular manufacturer. This was certainly true on this record, for example, as to mattresses produced by Perfection. But a merchant stocking, promoting and selling \u2014 or trying to sell \u2014a particular line cannot long endure if his potential customers are being urged not to buy. This may have a multiple effect. It freezes existing inventory, it reduces, if not eliminates the need for acquisition of new inventory. Two choices are open. If the merchant may decide to stay in that business, he must turn to a competing product. Or he may decide to withdraw from the market. In either event the consequence is to cause the merchant to cease doing business with the primary employer. And, of course, the decision to do so is brought about by the prohibited means of urging customers not to buy.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b668-8\">The fallacy of the approach of the Fruit &amp; Vegetable case is demonstrated by the fact that its standard effectually deprives \u00a7 (ii) of any real utility. The thesis of that decision is that the adverse economic effect<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> of the consumer picket line must be demonstrated affirmatively as a fact. That means that to obtain the protection afforded by Congress against the <em>threat </em>of injury, a party must first be injured. And if it is actual injury, what is to be the test of injury? If, for example, under the union\u2019s threat of posting a consumer picket line, a secondary retailer knuckles under as some did in Servette, Ine. (see note 10, <em>supra), </em>what must that retailer show? Must he prove not only that he lost the opportunity of making the average number of sales of that product, but also that this was not offset by substituted products of competitor suppliers ? Must the retailer demonstrate by identified customers that some refused to (a) purchase the picketed product or (b) patronize him at all? These and many other questions which would inhere in every secondary con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>sumer picketing demonstrate convincingly why Congress could not have intended that an Amendment designed to close a major and serious loophole would be stripped of all practical utility either by requiring that threatened damage be actually sustained, or that one feeling the pinch furnish specific answers to metaphysical inquiries as to the harm suffered.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-5\">We are equally firm that constitutional considerations do not require any such reading. Phrasing it differently, a legislative proscription of secondary consumer picketing does not abridge First Amendment free speech. It is, of course, almost always a mistake to speak in doctrinaire terms concerning basic constitutional guaranties. Consequently, we do not rule out the possibility that under some circumstances literal enforcement of \u00a7 (ii) might constitute an infringement. But several factors sustain validity in this case. First, the means of communicating the message to members of the public, including customers, actual or potential, of any secondary employer are effectually open through the \u00a7 8(b) (4) proviso. Second, the law reckons with the fact that picketing is something more than mere communication of information. Hughes v. Superior Court, 1950, 339 U.S. 460, 70 S.Ct. 718, 94 L.Ed. 985. It \u201cestablishes a <em>locus in quo </em>that has far more potential for inducing action or nonaction than the message the pickets convey.\u201d Building Service Employers International Union v. Gazzam, 1950, 339 U.S. 532, 537, 70 S.Ct. 784, 787, 94 L.Ed. 1045. And these \u201ccompulsive features inherent in picketing\u201d give it a character beyond \u201cmere communication as an appeal to reason.\u201d Hughes v. Superior Court, supra, 339 U.S. 460, 468, 70 S.Ct. 718, 723, 94 L.Ed. 985. As picketing is \u201cnot * * * the equivalent of speech as a matter of fact,\u201d it \u201cis not its inevitable legal equivalent,\u201d Hughes v. Superior Court, supra, 339 U.S. 460, 465-466, 70 S.Ct. 718, 721-722, 94 L.Ed. 985.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-7\">The evil here condemned by the 1959 Amendments is the pressures imposed on secondary and primary employers through coercive restraints, or the threats of them, on the secondary employer or those working for him. Notwithstanding sweeping and earlier broad pronouncements in terms of free speech, it is now recognized that Congress or the states may in enforcing a valid public policy, \u201cconstitutionally enjoin peaceful picketing aimed at preventing effectuation of that policy.\u201d International Brotherhood of Teamsters v. Vogt, Inc., 1957, 354 U.S. 284, 293, 77 S.Ct. 1166, 1170-1171, 1 L.Ed.2d 1347. Since states may take this protective action \u201c[t]here is no reason why Congress may not do likewise.\u201d International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers v. N. L. R. B., 1951, 341 U.S. 694, 705, 71 S.Ct. 954, 960, 95 L.Ed. 1299. In our view of the evolutionary development of free speech and picketing,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> we do not share the view of the District of Columbia Court of Appeals which regards as the distinguishing element the presence or absence of a likelihood that the particular picketing will be a \u201csignal\u201d for action by the <em>employees </em>of the secondary employer.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> One thing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>is certain from the 1959 Amendments. Congress regarded the pressuring of a secondary <em>employer </em>as much an evil as efforts to induce or encourage his employees to strike or not handle goods. The aim of the law is to free interstate commerce from the disruptive consequences of labor strife. In the legislative judgment, to \u201csignal\u201d <em>persons </em>into a sympathetic refusal to handle goods is no more obstructive than to bring about the same ultimate objective \u2014 cessation of business with the primary employer \u2014 through coercive pressures on the secondary employer. To tag one method as \u201cconsumer picketing\u201d does not afford a constitutional insulation denied to the other. When the purpose of the conduct is the same, it is for Congress to determine that similar restraints may be imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-4\">Sustaining the Board\u2019s Order, as we do, under \u00a7 (ii), we must now consider whether the Board\u2019s denial of \u00a7 (i) violation can be upheld.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> We conclude that the Board should have found the Union guilty of inducing or encouraging persons employed by the retail stores to cease handling goods, etc. in order to achieve the objective of having the retail stores cease doing business with Perfection. \u00a7 8(b) (4) (i). On these very same facts the Board twice held that the Union was guilty of prohibited conduct. Once was under the 1947 Act (125 NLRB 520), the other time under the 1959 Amendments (129 NLRB 1014). It is true that the District of Columbia Court of Appeals denied enforcement of the initial order.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> But as to these very same charges, we had earlier held that there was at least probable grounds for an interim \u00a7 10 (i) injunction.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> What brought about the change in the Board\u2019s factual conclusion? One thing is positively clear. The change did not come about from any change in the facts. The facts, as shown in the \u00a7 10(f) 1958 record and the 1960 stipulation, remained the same. What \u2014 and all \u2014 that changed was the Board\u2019s approach as former dissenting minorities found themselves in the majority as changes in the membership of the Board occurred.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Thus it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>was that after this record and ease was pending before us on the various petitions for review, the Board formally sought leave to (a) modify its Order or, alternatively, (b) to remand the case for reconsideration of the \u00a7 (i) finding in the light of its later decision in Upholsterers Frame and Bedding Workers (Minneapolis Home Furnishing Company), July 1961, 132 NLRB 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-5\">At the very outset we should make it clear that we are not faced with the problem of \u201coverruling\u201d the decision of the District of Columbia Court of Appeals in United Wholesale &amp; Warehouse Employees Local 261 v. N. L. R. B., 1960, 108 U.S.App.D.C. 341, 282 F.2d 824. We may assume that decision forecloses what was there presented though, as we point out later on, our cases would have led this Court to a contrary result. The fact is that the present Order is not based on the 1947 Act as was that decision. It is based on the Act as amended in 1959. These Amendments changed former \u00a7 8(b) (4) (A) in at least two significant ways. First, there was the elimination of the \u201cemployee\u201d loophole accomplished by substituting the phrase \u201cany individual employed by any person\u201d for the former phrase \u201cthe <em>employee </em>of any employer.\u201d The second was the elimination of the requirement of \u201cconcerted\u201d refusal to work, strike, etc. Though these two changes are not technically presented in this aspect of the present case, we reject the notion faintly urged by the Board that because of this, we must view this case now as though there had been no changes in the statute so far as inducing or encouraging employees of the secondary employer to resort to self-help. But we do not read this statute like a contract. These and all other changes manifested a strong congressional dissatisfaction with judicial actions and many judicial opinions. The addition of new elements and rearranging them into the structure of \u00a7\u00a7 (i) and (ii) were a part of the general purpose to make prohibitions effective against the evils thought to inhere in secondary boycotts. Consequently, we must review Board action on the basis of the amended Act unhindered by the intervening judicial decision based upon the former legislation.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-7\">When so done, we think that our prior decisions in N. L. R. B. v. Dallas General Drivers, Local 745, 5 Cir., 1959, 264 F.2d 642, cert. denied, 361 U.S. 814, 80 S.Ct. 54, 4 L.Ed.2d 61; and Superior Derrick Corp. v. N. L. R. B., 5 Cir., 1960, 273 F.2d 891, cert. denied, 364 U.S. 816, 81 S.Ct. 47, 5 L.Ed.2d 47,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> require us to hold that the Board\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>reversal of its decision as to \u00a7 (i) in the third, last, and supplemental Order, 134 NLRB No. 99, cannot be sustained. In brief, those cases rest on a recognition of the fact that the real \u201cmessage\u201d from such picketing is not measured by the signs or legends or pamphlets carried or handed out by the pickets. Applying the principles developed in decisions sustaining constitutionality of restrictions on picketing (see note 12, <em>swpra), </em>these cases point out that a picket line is an appeal for others to join forces with employees of the primary employer. As the Board itself pointed out in its earlier decision, the \u201cforeseeable consequence\u201d and \u201cthe natural and probable result\u201d of such a secondary picket line \u201cis to induce a strike * * Real distinctions cannot be made on the ground, say, that the signs in Dallas Drivers used words such as \u201cunfair,\u201d or \u201cstrike.\u201d Courts need not be blind to what all others know. Union adherents are hardly so dense or objective that these things must be spelled out in words intelligible to the youngest child. For one union through pickets to say to other union members approaching a business establishment as potential customers that such store sells goods made by nonunion workers or by strike breakers displacing union workers during labor controversy does not soften the blow. This carries exactly the same message as the more vivid, fighting words of \u201cscab,\u201d \u201cunfair,\u201d \u201cstrike-breaker,\u201d or the like. The impact on workers is no less on one side of the line than on the other.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-12\">For the same reasons developed in our prior decisions, we think that in this case the conduct of the picket line was to induce or encourage employees of the stores to refuse to handle goods manufactured by Perfection. Pertinent to this are the incidents described at the outset showing specific, actions directed by the pickets to employees of the stores calculated to shame or embarrass them into not crossing the picket line, etc.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b672-13\">This brings us then to Perfection\u2019s petition for review which attacked the Order because it was too general and vague. As originally entered covering both \u00a7\u00a7 (i) and (ii) violations, the cease and desist order against the Union was in statutory terms.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> The only change by the supplemental order on remand was to eliminate the paragraph as to \u00a7 (i).</p>\n<p id=\"b672-14\">Perfection makes two principal contentions. The first is that since the power of contempt may be the sole means of obtaining compliance, great heed should be paid to numerous decisions pointing out the necessity for defining as accurately as possible just what it is a party may or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>may not do under the injunctive order.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> The second is that since the institution of contempt proceedings of the Court of Appeals\u2019 Order of enforcement of a Labor Board decision is left to the Board alone, not a charging or other interested party,<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> the Order should be specific so that the affected primary and secondary employers are not left to the administrative whim or discretion of the Board or its General Counsel in the preliminary determination of whether the subsequent conduct does, or does not, in the words of the statute repeated in the Order constitute prohibited \u00a7 (i) or (ii) action. This latter is particularly important, Perfection contends, because of the undulating decisions of the Board in matters bearing upon \u00a7 8(b) (4) (i) and (ii) (B) (see note 17, <em>supra,). </em>This leads Perfection to urge us to define what is picketing, just what pickets may do in hand billing, what constitutes truthful publicity under the proviso, and the like.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-5\">Although we agree generally with the approach that orders setting in train the sometimes formidable force of a contempt proceeding, Cone Bros. Contracting Co. v. N. L. R. B., 5 Cir., 1956, 235 F.2d 37, should be as particular as possible, and attention has recently been focused on the necessity that administrative agencies do more than parrot the statute,<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> we are loath to pinpoint too exactly all of the things which might infringe the Order which we now require to be enforced as modified. Two factors, among others, bear on this. The first is that the administrative agency and process should not be artificially restricted where the particular incidents adjudged to violate the Act are illustrative of discriminatory practices which may take many forms. Cf. N. L. R. B. v. R. L. Zeigler, Inc., 5 Cir., 1962, 298 F.2d 671, at 673. Second, many of the things earnestly apprehended by Perfection may never come to pass. Expressions today will necessarily be academic-advice not related to a case or controversy. We do think, however, that especially in view of the \u00a7 8(b) (4) proviso, there should be no doubt that consumer picketing of the kind here involved is to-be prohibited. After all of this lengthy, prolonged, costly, judicial travail, future similar conduct ought not to require re-litigation of whether this is conduct forbidden by \u00a7\u00a7 (i) and (ii). Perhaps this- and other matters related to this actual record should be explicitly covered in the Order, but we refrain from extended discussion since the settling of the form of the decree to be entered by this Court is the subject of further action under our Rule 38.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-14\">Order enforced in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-15\">Order modified in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-16\">Order reversed in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b662-12\">.

Stated otherwise, I concur in the able opinion of my Brother Brown except that part holding that the consumer picket line constituted a violation of \u00a7 8(b) (4) (i) (B). I agree with the Board\u2019s Supplemental Decision that the Union\u2019s consumer picketing at the retail: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>stores did not \u201cinduce or encourage\u201d employees of those stores to engage in a strike or refusal within the meaning of \u00a7 8(b) (4) (i) (B). See United Wholesale &amp; Warehouse Employees, Local 261 v. N. L. R. B., 1960, 108 U.S.App.D.C. 341, 282 F.2d 824; N. L. R. B. v.
