Upton went on duty as a fireman on a diesel locomotive on a freight train at 8:00 o\u2019clock on the night of September 21, 1959, and remained on such duty until 3:30 A.M. on September 22, or for a period of seven and one-half (7%) hours. He was then off duty until 11:00 A.M. on September 22, at which time he went back on duty on a yard engine and remained continuously at work on the engine until 7:00 P.M. on the 22nd, a period of eight (8) hours. About an hour before Upton\u2019s release at 7:00 P.M., the trainmaster informed him that he would be expected to report back on duty at 8:00 P.M. He arrived at the yard office a few minutes before 8:00 P.M., was again assigned to the freight and worked continuously from 8:00 P.M. on September 22 to 3:45 A.M., September 23. Thus, during the twenty-four-hour period commencing at 8:00 P.M., September 21, Upton worked one shift of seven and one-half (7%) hours and another of eight (8) hours, totalling fifteen and one-half (15%) hours.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-4\">The issue narrows to whether the last one hour from 7:00 P.M. to 8:00 P.M. on the 22nd should be counted as on duty or off duty. If that hour is counted as on duty, then Upton was on duty sixteen and one-half (16%) hours in the aggregate in the twenty-four-hour period, and the Railroad Company violated section 62 by requiring or permitting him to continue or again go on duty at 8:00 P.M. on the 22nd without having had at least eight consecutive hours off duty. If that last one hour is counted as off duty, then Upton was on duty in the twenty-four-hour period only fifteen and one-half (15%) hours and the Railroad Company did not violate section 62.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-5\">Whether that one hour break in which Upton was not actually working should be counted as on duty or off duty depends upon whether it afforded a substantial and opportune period of rest under all the circumstances. Missouri, K. &amp; T. R. Co. of Texas v. United States, 1913, 231 U.S. 112, 119, 34 S.Ct. 26, 58 L.Ed. 144; Northern Pacific Ry. Co. v. United States, 9 Cir., 1915, 220 F. 108, 110; United States v. Northern Pacific R. Co., E.D.Wash.1914, 213 F. 539; Southern Pacific Co. v. United States, 9 Cir., 1915, 222 F. 46, 52; Minneapolis &amp; St. L. R. Co. v. United States, 8 Cir., 1917, 245 F. 60, 64; United States v. New York, N. H. &amp; H. R. Co., 1 Cir., 1921, 274 F. 321, 325; United States v. Denver &amp; R. G. R. Co., Dis.N.M., 1912, 197 F. 629, 632; United States v. Atchison, T. &amp; S. F. R. Co., Dis.N.M., 1916, 232 F. 196; United States v. Pitcairn, E.D.Mo.1938, 23 F.Supp. 242; United States v. Pennsylvania R. Co., M.D.Penn.1949, 85 F.Supp. 556.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-8\">Telegraph operators come under a separate provision of section 62, which limits them to nine hours on duty in any twenty-four-hour period. The courts have approved as off duty a one-hour release for meals for operators under the circumstances of the particular case. United States v. New York, N. H. &amp; H. R. Co., supra; United States v. Atchison, T. &amp; S. F. Ry. Co., supra. Those cases are not controlling as to trainmen who may be required to work as much as sixteen hours in any twenty-four-hour period. As to trainmen, periods of 30 minutes to one hour (United States v. Chicago, M. &amp; P. S. Ry. Co., supra), of 1% hours (United States v. Pitcairn, supra), or even of 2 to 2% hours (Minneapolis &amp; St. L. R. Co. v. United States, supra) have been held insufficient to break the continuity of service.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-10\">Generally, the question of whether a release affords a substantial and opportune period of rest under all the circumstances, and hence whether the release is sufficient to break the continuity of service, viewed in light of the particular circumstance's involved, is one of fact for the jury. Southern Pacific Co. v. United States, supra; Minneapolis &amp; St. L. R. Co. v. United States, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-11\">We think that it is clear that the district court erred in directing a verdict for the Railroad Company. The United States insists further that its motion for a directed verdict should have been granted. Under the authorities, and consider<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>ing the purposes of the act, that insistence would have considerable weight if this case involved the ordinarily busy trainman. The employee here involved, however, was a fireman on a diesel locomotive. There was much testimony that actually he had nothing to do when he was on duty, and also testimony to the contrary. In the light of that evidence and of all of the other circumstances in the case, we think that a question of fact was presented for the jury\u2019s determination as to whether the one hour afforded a substantial and opportune period of rest.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-4\">The judgment is therefore reversed and the cause remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-5\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b632-9\">.
