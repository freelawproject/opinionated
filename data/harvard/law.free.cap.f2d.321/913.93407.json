Michaels. Jr., its President, were convicted by jury verdict on both counts of an indictment charging, in Count I thereof, that the corporation was a retail dealer of distilled spirits, wines and beer, and \u201ca person required to keep and file records, returns,\u201d etc., as required by Chapter 51, Title 26 U.S.C.A., and James A. Michaels, Jr., being its President \u201cdid fail and refuse to preserve and produce such documents so required to be kept\u201d when demand for inspection thereof was made by investigators of the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax Unit, all in violation of Section 5603(b) (5), Title 26 U.S.C.A. Count II charged the corporation as being a person required to keep and file such records, and Michaels, being its President, \u201cfor failing to keep such documents and make required entries therein, to-wit, a record in book form of all distilled spirits, wines and beer received, or, in the alternative, to keep all invoices of, and bills for, all distilled spirits, wines and beer received\u201d by Michaels Enterprises, Inc., in violation of Section 5603(b) (1), Title 26 U.S.C.A.</p>\n<p id=\"b962-21\">Sub-part E of Chapter 51, supra, imposes an \u201cOccupational Tax\u201d on \u201cRetail Dealers\u201d of distilled spirits, wines and beer.

Appellants admit they \u201cdid not object to the failure of the (District) Court to instruct on intent. Indeed (they say) the case was tried and argued (before that Court) on the theory that intent was not an element of the offenses.\u201d That such is and was the proper concept of the nature of crimes for which appellants were indicted and found guilty is made manifest by these considerations. The statutes in question are regulatory measures enacted in the exercise of what is commonly called the police power, where emphasis is placed on a \u201cknowing\u201d violation thereof, rather than \u201cintent\u201d to commit an \u201comission of duty.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b963-19\">\u201cHence, legislation applicable to such offenses, as a matter of policy, does not specify intent as a necessary element. The accused, if he does not will the violation, usually is in a position to prevent it with no more care than society might reasonably expect and no more exertion than it might reasonably exact from one who assumes his responsibilities.\u201d Morissette v. United States, 342 U.S. 246, 256, 72 S.Ct. 240, 246, 96 L.Ed. 288 (1951).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b963-21\">Section 5603(b), supra, providing penalty for failure to comply with the record-keeping provisions of sub-part E of Chapter 51, supra, \u201cotherwise than with intent to defraud the United States\u201d is a regulatory measure, and \u201cintent\u201d to violate the provisions thereof is not an essential element of the offense. United States v. Behrman, 258 U.S. 280, 42 S.Ct. 303, 66 L.Ed. 619 (1921); United States v. Balint, 258 U.S. 250, 42 S.Ct. 301, 66 L.Ed. 604 (1921). The statute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"916\">*916</page-number>creates a crime <em>mala prohibita </em>and not <em>malum in se. </em>Lack of intent to violate the mandate thereof is no defense. Morissette v. United States, supra; Riss &amp; Company v. United States, 262 F.2d 245 (8 Cir. 1958); Reyes v. United States, 258 F.2d 774 (9 Cir. 1958); United States v. Juzwiak, 258 F.2d 844, 845 (2 Cir. 1958), cert. den. 359 U.S. 939, 79 S.Ct. 652, 3 L.Ed.2d 639. In the absence of \u201cintent\u201d from a statute such as 5603(b), supra, an implication of <em>scienter </em>is the most that may be inferred \u201cwhere there is no reason to suppose the Congress, by deliberate choice, omitted such requirement.\u201d Delaney v. United States, 199 F.2d 107, 117 (1 Cir. 1952). The trial Court in the case at bar charged the jury as to the appellants\u2019 \u201cknowing\u201d violation of the applicable statutes. That being so, it was not error to \u201cfail to instruct on intent\u201d as appellants here assert.</p>\n<p id=\"b964-4\">The evidence relating to appellants\u2019 violations of the revenue laws, supra, is not substantially in dispute. Tersely stated and without reference to detail matter appearing in the record, it was established: ... In August 1961, agents of the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax Unit went to Michaels Bar and Restaurant in St. Louis, Missouri, to make a retail liquor inspection and requested the bartender in charge to produce retail liquor \u201cinvoices\u201d or records of all distilled spirits, wines and beer received by the corporate defendant for the previous two years. At that time, five or ten invoices were made available to them for inspection. They requested additional invoices, but were told the individual defendant, James A. Michaels, Jr., President of the defendant corporation, was not present but would return the next day. The agents returned the following day and requested defendant Michaels to produce for inspection the retail liquor records. He told them he would have to \u201cdig them up\u201d and that they should come back the next day. The agents returned the next day. At that time, thirty-seven retail liquor invoices were turned over to them for inspection by Michaels, only twenty of which were for the years 1959, 1960 and 1961. An additional request was made by the agents for any other invoice records. Defendant Michaels told them there were no others because they had been destroyed by a flood occurring in the basement of the premises. By other evidence, the Government established that during the critical period four hundred fifty transactions by wholesale liquor dealers were recorded as sales of distilled spirits, etc., made to the defendant corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b964-6\">The evidence of appellants was to the effect that when distilled spirits, etc. were received at the defendant corporation\u2019s place of business, invoices therefor were placed on the back-bar until an accountant came and took them to his office to prepare financial statements of the corporation for income tax purposes. Subsequently, they were returned to the corporate defendant\u2019s place of business and stored in cardboard boxes in the basement. In June 1961, the basement was flooded and all such stored bills and invoices for distilled spirits received by the corporation got wet and as a result thereof were removed and destroyed because of their unsanitary condition. For that reason alone, defendants asserted they were unable to produce the required records for inspection. However, the evidence of the Government established that certain invoices for purchases of distilled spirits, wines and beer received by the defendant corporation after the occurrence of the basement flood were not produced for inspection when request therefor was made by the agents. No explanation for that anomalous situation was attempted by any evidence adduced by appellants.</p>\n<p id=\"b964-7\">It has been so often reiterated that failure to except to \u201cthe charge or omission therefrom\u201d as given, \u201cstating distinctly the matter to which' (one) objects and the grounds of his objection\u201d (Rule 30 F.R.Cr.P., 18 U.S.C.A.), presents nothing for appellate review, so far as the charge to a jury in a criminal ease is to be considered, that fortifying authorities should not be necessary. But <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"917\">*917</page-number>-see, Gendron v. United States, 295 F.2d 897 (8 Cir. 1961); Johnson v. United States, 291 F.2d 150 (8 Cir. 1961); Rizzo v. United States, 295 F.2d 638 (8 Cir. 1961); Wegman v. United States, 272 F.2d 31 (8 Cir. 1959); Rosenbloom v. United States, 259 F.2d 500 (8 Cir. 1958) cert. den. 358 U.S. 929, 79 S.Ct. 315, 3 L.Ed.2d 302; Davis v. United States, 229 F.2d 181 (8 Cir. 1956), cert. den. 351 U.S. 904, 76 S.Ct. 706, 100 L.Ed. 1441; Kreinbring v. United States, 216 F.2d 671 (8 Cir. 1954).</p>\n<p id=\"b965-6\">There is nothing vague about the Tcord-keeping provisions of Chapter 51, Title 26 U.S.C.A. as they relate to \u201cretail dealers in liquor\u201d and the \u201cpreservation\u201d of records by such dealers \u201cfor inspection by internal revenue officers \u2022during business hours,\u201d nor the penalty .provided for failure to comply therewith. The charge as given to the jury in the case at bar was amply adequate to inform the jury as to the elements of an offense thereunder and \u201cknowing\u201d violation thereof. The charge specifically -presented to the jury appellants\u2019 contention that if \u201cthe flooding of (the) basement and the * * * destruction of the records was caused by agencies or events \u2022entirely outside the control of (the) defendants\u201d and for that reason their \u201cinability * * * to produce (the) books and records on demand\u201d was a result of that \u201cfortuitous circumstance\u201d etc., it \u201cshould acquit these defendants.\u201d In the light of the charge considered as a whole, there was no \u201cplain error\u201d therein as here asserted by appellants for the first time. Both counts of the indictment were couched in the mandate language \u2022of the applicable statutes, the provisions of which are concise, clear and basically \u00a1simple. The citation of the specific provisions thereof was sufficient to inform the jury as to what facts it was required to find to establish the guilt of appellants. The defendants\u2019 contention that the jury was not sufficiently informed of what it should find to establish guilt of the charge made against them is without merit. It is sufficient for us because the District Court gave no erroneous direction thereby, absent a request for a more specific charge. Stassi v. United States, 50 F.2d 526 (8 Cir. 1931).</p>\n<p id=\"b965-8\">Concededly, the appellants failed to \u201ckeep\u201d some of the documents and records they were required to maintain as provided in Sections 5124(a) and 5603(1) of Chapter 51, supra. At the trial of this ease, certain \u201cinvoices\u201d for distilled spirits were introduced into evidence by appellants. The contention was made that such were all the invoices available to them which were not destroyed as a consequence of the flood. Evidence adduced by the Government was to the effect that some such exhibits introduced into evidence by appellants were not produced by them for inspection when requested by agents of the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax Unit at the time the agents appeared at the corporate defendant\u2019s premises. Hence, the evidence established that notwithstanding the contention made by appellants that some \u201cinvoices\u201d kept by them were damaged by the flood, at the time of the inspection in question, they had other pertinent \u201cinvoices\u201d in their possession which were not exhibited for inspection by the agents as required by the statutes, supra. Therefore, the evidence clearly established that appellants knowingly did not produce some invoices they did retain, for inspection when request therefor was made by the agents. One 1941 Buick Sedan, Motor No. 64286106 v. United States, 158 F.2d 445 (10 Cir. 1946).</p>\n<p id=\"b965-9\">Appellants did not move for an acquittal at the close of all the evidence. No question of sufficiency of the evidence to support the verdict can now be made before this Court. Rosenbloom v. United States, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-10\">The convictions appealed from are affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b962-14\">. \u201c\u00a7 5124.
