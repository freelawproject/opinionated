The Court sentenced each to imprisonment for three years and to pay a fine of $1,750, but suspended the sentence of imprisonment in each case on condition that the fine be paid on or before January 1, 1962. The appellants were admitted to bail pending this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-26\">After a careful review of the record and briefs, we hold that the evidence was sufficient to support the verdict. We find no reversible error in any of the trial judge\u2019s rulings. The appellants received a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-27\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
