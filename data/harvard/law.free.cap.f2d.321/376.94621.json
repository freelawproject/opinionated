Ingram had charged Local 28 with unfair labor practices. The Board found Local 28 guilty of a violation of Section 8(b) (1) (A) of the National Labor Relations Act, as amended, 61 Stat. 140-141, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(b) (1) (A) (1958), but solely as an agent of others. It declined to find Local 28 a \u201clabor organization\u201d under the Act and thus responsible as a principal. Ingram complains of this holding, urging that Local 28 is not in fact an association of \u201csupervisors,\u201d as the Board found, but is a union of \u201cemployees,\u201d under the pertinent provisions of the Act.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b425-4\">Local 28 is composed of masters, mates and pilots, serving on vessels of a number of employers. Ingram, which operates barges on the Mississippi River, says that the \u201cmates\u201d on its barges \u2014 all members of Local 28 \u2014 are actually at most only \u201cstraw bosses,\u201d often performing manual labor, and hence are not \u201csupervisors\u201d within the meaning of the Act.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Trial Examiner, acting on the basis of a voluminous record, disagreed. Plis findings and conclusions were adopted by the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">The Board\u2019s \u201cexperience in the administration of the statute gives it familiarity with the circumstances and backgrounds of employment relationships in various industries * * National Labor Relations Board v. Hearst Publications, 322 U.S. 111, at 130, 64 S.Ct. 851, at 860, 88 L.Ed. 1170 (1944). Its \u201cdetermination that specified persons are \u2018employees\u2019 under this Act is to be accepted if it has \u2018warrant in the record\u2019 and a reasonable basis in law\u2019\u2019 Id. at 131, 64 S.Ct. at 861. Surely its determination that certain persons are not \u201cemployees\u201d under the Act is entitled to similar weight.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-13\">On reviewing the record before us we cannot say that the Trial Examiner or the Board erred. The findings and conclusions have adequate support in the evidence, insofar as it was put before us by the parties, and have a reasonable basis in law. We need not attempt to summarize the evidence here, as the text of the Trial Examiner\u2019s report is readily available elsewhere. See 136 N.L.R.B. 1175 at 1190 et seq. (1963). The following passage in his report gives the essence of his reasoning:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b425-14\">\u201c4. Mates have the responsibility for the accomplishment of a variety of tasks aboard their boats. Some of them are of a routine nature involving unskilled manual operations. Others, however, particularly during locking and docking operations and in emergency situations, involve the exercise of independent judgment in the issuance of orders to deckhands and other deck employees which require prompt and faithful obedience for the protection of person and property. With respect to the performance of all their responsibilities mates have authority to order performance of duty by sub<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>ordinate deckhands and other deck employees who must obey these orders or risk discharge for disobedience.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-4\">\u201c5. The power and authority of pilots and mates to command and obtain obedience to their orders is constant and may be applied at any time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-5\">\u201cIn sum, I find that the record insurmountably establishes that masters, pilots, and mates are individuals who in the interest of their employers have authority \u2018responsibly to direct\u2019 employees within the meaning of the quoted phrase as it appears in Section 2(11) of the Act and are, therefore, supervisors as defined by that section. In concluding that they are supervisors I need not go beyond the assigned reason, and will therefore not dwell upon other possible reasons to support my conclusion which may be derived from some of the evidence indicating authority by pilots and mates to discipline employees or effectively to recommend their discipline.\u201d 136 N.L.R.B. at 1203.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b426-6\">Numerous arguments of policy can be offered, of course, for and against making associations such as Local 28 subject to the Act as \u201clabor organizations.\u201d Such arguments are for the Congress, and not the courts. See Packard Motor Car Co. v. National Labor Relations Board, 330 U.S. 485, 490, 67 S.Ct. 789, 91 L.Ed. 1040 (1947).</p>\n<p id=\"b426-7\">For these reasons, in No. 17,193, the Board\u2019s order will be affirmed. In No. 17,157, we have before us a petition by the Board for the enforcement of its order. This will be granted. No. 17,062 is before us on petition of Local 28 to review and set aside certain portions of the Board\u2019s order. However, Local 28 has not filed a brief, and its petition will be dismissed for lack of prosecution.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b425-7\">. Section 2(3) of the Act provides in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AA7\">\u201cThe term \u2018employee\u2019 * * * shall not include * <em>* </em>* any individual employed as a supervisor * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AHs\">Section 2(5) of the Act provides in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ApF\">\u201cThe term \u2018labor organization\u2019 means any organization of any kind * * * in which employees participate and which exists for the purpose * * * of dealing with employers concerning grievances, labor disputes * * Section 2(11) of the Act defines \u201csupervisor\u201d as: \u201cany individual having authority, in the interest of the employer, to hire, transfer, suspend, lay off, recall, promote, discharge, assign, reward, or discipline other employees, or responsibly to direct them, or to adjust their grievances, or effectively to recommend such action, if in connection with the foregoing the exercise of such authority is not of a merely routine or clerical nature, but requires the use of independent judgment.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b425-16\">.
