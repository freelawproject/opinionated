BERNARD GOODWYN.\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In this appeal, we consider whether an express easement created by a 1936 deed was stationary or moved with the changing mean high water line.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Background\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In 1936, the Grand View Development Corporation dissolved and distributed most of a large tract of real estate in what is now the White Marsh Beach area of Hampton, Virginia, to its shareholders. The deed distributing the land stated\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   The parties to this deed take the above mentioned and described property subject to an easement on a\n   twenty foot road as designated on the map recorded with this deed, which easement is to run with the land and from the parties hereto to their assigns and heirs but it is expressly stated that the said twenty foot road shall not become a public road, but merely an easement for the parties, their heirs or assigns to the deed.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The referenced map includes two parallel lines labeled \"Twenty Foot Road\" (the easement) crossing the lots that fronted the Chesapeake Bay. The map depicts \"S 20-00 W\" as the southern starting point of the easement. Following the easement from south to north, a place where the easement makes a slight bend is labelled \"980.0' S29.55W.\" Thereafter, between the parallel lines depicting the road is written \"Along Present Mean High Water.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    *\n   </footnotemark>\n   A \"Stake\" is depicted at the northern terminus of the easement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Due to changes in the sand and water levels since 1936, the easement, as located on the map, is now under the Chesapeake Bay. Because of a dispute over whether the easement still exists, Stephen M. Mallon, Helen G. Mallon, Arne Hasselquist, Lauren Hasselquist and Grandview Islanders, LLC (collectively, \"Mallon\"), landowners of some of the properties conveyed by the 1936 deed, sought a declaratory judgment in the Circuit Court of the City of Hampton. They claim that the location of the express easement moved with the mean high water line as the beach eroded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Respondents Marble Technologies, Inc. and Sebastian Plucinski (collectively, \"Marble\") filed an answer. They assert that the easement has not moved and the land where the easement was located is now on the bottom of the Chesapeake Bay, resulting in extinguishment of the easement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The circuit court granted several opportunities for the addition of new parties. On November 30, 2012, upon joint motion of the parties, the court ordered that the style of the case be amended to add additional parties who had an interest in the suit. On March 12, 2013, the court granted Marble's motion for leave to add additional\n   defendants to its counterclaim, cross-claim and third party complaint. On April 3, 2013, despite objection by Mallon, the circuit court granted Marble's motion for a continuance of the trial to add necessary parties.\n   Although the amended complaint, counterclaim, cross-claim and third party complaint include more than forty individuals and entities as parties and no additional parties were added after the April 3, 2013 continuance, approximately six months later, Marble asked for another continuance of the trial so that necessary parties could be added. The court denied the request for a continuance and proceeded with the trial on October 30, 2013. Prior to trial, the parties stipulated that not all of the successors-in-title of the properties conveyed in the deed were parties to this action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   At trial, the circuit court considered the issue of whether the express terms of the easement were such that the easement moved with the changing coastline. The court held that the deed and map were ambiguous and considered parol evidence to ascertain the intent of parties to the deed and map. The parties presented conflicting expert testimony on whether the map's drafter intended to have the easement remain stationary or move with the changing coastline.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The circuit court ruled that Mallon has a variable express easement that moves with the mean high water line. Marble appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Marble assigns error as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   1. The lower court erred in holding a trial and entering a final order without first joining as necessary parties all the landowners that would be affected by any declaratory judgment rendered.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   2. The lower court erred in holding that the twenty foot easement on the road established in 1936 was not extinguished by the subsequent erosion of the shoreline.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   3. The lower court erred in finding the relevant deed and plat ambiguous and in allowing Plaintiffs' expert to offer parole [sic] evidence regarding the intent of the drafters of those documents.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Analysis\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Marble argues that the circuit court erred by failing to join all necessary parties and rendering final judgment when all parties who owned property that was part of the 1936 conveyance were not before the court. Mallon argues that the circuit court did not err in deciding the case without adding additional parties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Concerning the issue of necessary parties, we have stated that \" '[a]ll persons interested in the subject matter of a suit and to be affected by its results are necessary parties.' \"\n   <em>\n    Michael E.

With the numerous and varied parties added to the action, the multiple opportunities the court provided the litigants to add parties and no claim that any of the allegedly missing parties were indispensable, we conclude that the circuit court did not abuse its discretion in allowing the case to proceed to trial with the parties it had before it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Marble contends that the deed and map unambiguously designated the easement as existing at a specific location and that the easement has not moved with the erosion of the land. Moreover,\n   Marble claims that because the deed and map unambiguously dictated\n   that the easement was stationary, the circuit court erred in considering parol evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Mallon asserts that the court correctly allowed parol evidence to interpret the deed and map because the map is ambiguous about whether the easement moves with the mean high water line. They claim that the easement has moved over time to follow the changing mean high water line.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   We review de novo a circuit court's interpretation of words in a deed.\n   <em>\n    Beeren &amp; Barry Invs., LLC v.

Additionally, it denotes a point where the easement makes a slight bend as \"980.0' S29.55W.\" It designates the easement as running \"Along Present Mean High Water.\" The map notes the location of a \"Stake\" at the northern end of the designated \"Twenty Foot Road.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Mallon claims that the designation \"Along Present Mean High Water\" means that the location of the express easement moves with the movement of the mean high water line. We must discern the meaning of \"present.\" Webster's Third New International Dictionary defines \"present\" as \"now existing or in progress: begun but not ended: now being in view, being dealt with, or being under consideration: being at this time: not past or future: contemporary.\" Webster's Third New International Dictionary 1793 (1993);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Black's Law Dictionary 1374 (10th ed.2014) (defining \"present\" as \"now existing; at hand\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The map depicts the easement as existing \"Along\n   <em>\n    Present\n   </em>\n   Mean High Water,\" meaning the line as it existed in 1936 when the map was created. (Emphasis added.) This is confirmed by the fact that the map utilizes metes and bounds and a stationary marker to show the easement's location. Thus, we hold that the map is unambiguous regarding the location of the easement. The metes and bounds descriptions and the stationary markers dispel any claim of ambiguity. Nothing on the map or in the deed indicates that the easement was to\n   <em>\n    move\n   </em>\n   with the changing coastline.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lipke v.
