He is challenging his convictions in a \u00a7 2254 proceeding that has not yet been adjudicated by the district court. This appeal concerns the district court\u2019s denial of Tijeri-na\u2019s motions for judicial notice and for release, and we are also presented with Tijerina\u2019s motion requesting this court to take judicial notice under Fed.R.Evid. 201. Tijerina\u2019s motion for judicial notice is DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-19\">Insofar as Tijerina seeks review of the district court\u2019s denial of his motion for judicial notice, we are without jurisdiction to entertain this claim because it does not arise from an appealable order. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, \u00a7 1292(a),(b); Fed.R.CivP. 54(b); <em>Dardar v. Lafourche Realty Co., </em>849 F.2d 955, 957 (5th Cir.1988); <em>Save the Bay, Inc. v. United States Army, </em>639 F.2d 1100, 1102 &amp; n. 3 (5th Cir.1981). Consequently, Tijerina\u2019s appeal is DISMISSED FOR WANT OF JURISDICTION to the extent he challenges the district court\u2019s denial of his motion for judicial notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-20\">According to Tijerina, he should be released because his convictions are the result of a conspiracy by counsel and several state officials and because his incarceration is not lawful. These arguments do not suffice to show that the instant \u00a7 2254 proceedings involve extraordinary circumstances, nor has Tijerina shown that his \u00a7 2254 petition involves \u201csubstantial constitutional claims upon which he has a high probability of success.\u201d <em>See Calley v. Callaway, </em>496 F.2d 701, 702 (5th Cir.1974). We AFFIRM the district court\u2019s denial of Tijerina\u2019s motion seeking release.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b613-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
