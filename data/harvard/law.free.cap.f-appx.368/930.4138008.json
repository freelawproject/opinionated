Thompson appeals <em>pro se </em>the denial of his motion to vacate, set aside, or correct the sentence of 46 months of imprisonment imposed after revocation of his supervised release. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. We granted a certificate of appealability to address whether Thompson was served with a copy of the report and recommendation that the district court deny Thompson\u2019s motion to vacate and whether \u201cthe district court erred by relying on affidavits presented by the government, which contradicted the arguments and affidavits presented by Thompson.\u201d We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-19\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b959-20\">We divide our discussion of the background into two parts. First, we discuss Thompson\u2019s conviction and the revocation of supervised probation that resulted in the sentence Thompson now challenges. Second, we discuss Thompson\u2019s motion to vacate his sentence and the decision of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-21\">\n<em>A. Thompson\u2019s Conviction and Revocation of His Supervised Probation</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b959-22\">In 1993, Thompson pleaded guilty to conspiracy to distribute cocaine base, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846, and he was sentenced to 137 months of imprisonment and five years of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"932\">*932</page-number>supervised release. In 2005, the government filed a petition to revoke Thompson\u2019s supervised release. The government alleged that on November 17, 2005, Thompson had been arrested for obstructing a governmental operation and possessing cocaine base and Thompson had possessed a firearm.</p>\n<p id=\"b960-4\">At the revocation hearing, the government introduced testimony from the arresting officer, Steven Woods of the Lan-ett Police Department, and Thompson\u2019s probation officer, James Chappell. Woods testified that he stopped to investigate after he observed that Thompson\u2019s vehicle was parked illegally near an intersection in a \u201chigh drug crime area\u201d; Thompson was talking to Ernest Lyman, who Woods knew abused cocaine base; and Lyman was holding money in his hand. Woods testified that he arrested Lyman after discovering a crack pipe in his hat.</p>\n<p id=\"b960-5\">Woods proceeded to Thompson\u2019s car to investigate further. Woods testified that he arrested Thompson for obstructing a governmental operation because Thompson interfered with Woods\u2019s instructions to Thompson\u2019s girlfriend to exit the passenger seat of Thompson\u2019s car. Woods also testified that he inventoried Thompson\u2019s car and discovered on the driver\u2019s seat a black fanny pack that contained cocaine base and a loaded nine millimeter pistol. Chappell testified that Thompson had said the pack was owned by one of his daughter\u2019s fiiends or a person hired to assist Thompson\u2019s mother.</p>\n<p id=\"b960-6\">Thompson denied any wrongdoing, and he argued through counsel that someone else owned the fanny pack and he had been targeted by Woods. After the government rested its case, defense counsel argued that the \u201csingle person who was closest to [the fanny pack] and had the greatest opportunity to exercise control and dominion over that bag\u201d was Thompson\u2019s girlfriend and Thompson \u201cdid not knowingly ... allow that fanny pack to be in that car.\u201d Defense counsel also argued that \u201cif someone got into [Thompson\u2019s] car with a black fanny pack, i.e., his passenger, there\u2019s absolutely no evidence that he would have necessarily asked what was in the bag or inspected the bag.\u201d Defense counsel called Lyman as a witness. Lyman testified that Thompson had loaned him money, Thompson had stood still when Woods ordered Thompson\u2019s girlfriend out of the car, and Woods later charged Lyman for buying a controlled substance because he had been disruptive at the police station.</p>\n<p id=\"b960-8\">Thompson testified that he had been stopped by Woods on three occasions and ticketed for traffic offenses he had not committed. Thompson did not deny that the fanny pack had been discovered in his car. Thompson testified that he did not own or know about the bag and he had allowed his daughter and a friend to drive his car earlier that day. Thompson admitted that he had advised his girlfriend to remain in the car, but Thompson denied that he had interfered physically with Woods\u2019s investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b960-9\">The district court found that Thompson had obstructed a government operation and he had possessed cocaine base and a firearm. The district court revoked Thompson\u2019s supervised release and sentenced him to 46 months of imprisonment and one year of supervised release. This Court affirmed and held that the district court did not abuse its discretion by revoking Thompson\u2019s supervised release because the \u201cevidence established that, more likely than not, Thompson constructively possessed the contraband,\u201d and the district court did not clearly err in crediting Woods\u2019s testimony notwithstanding evidence from Thompson that \u2018Woods\u2019s testimony was incredible and biased.\u201d <em>United </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"933\">*933</page-number><em>States v. Thompson, </em>210 Fed.Appx. 857, 859 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b961-5\">\n<em>B. Thompson\u2019s Post-Revocation Proceedings</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b961-6\">In October 2007, Thompson filed a motion to vacate his sentence. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. Thompson argued that his attorney acted ineffectively at the revocation hearing for, among other reasons, failing to present testimony from Thompson\u2019s girlfriend, Sylvia Banks. Thompson attached to his motion an affidavit signed by Banks that appeared to have been prepared on the same typewriter as the brief in support of Thompson\u2019s motion to vacate. Banks attested that Thompson did not interfere physically with Woods\u2019s investigation and Thompson did not have \u201ca bag with him[] when he got into the car, nor did he leave a bag on his seat when he got out of the car.\u201d Thompson also argued that he was entitled to relief on the ground he had newly discovered evidence that Woods had planted the fanny pack in his car. In support of his argument, Thompson attached to his motion a newspaper report that Woods had been investigated and fired for abusing his authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-7\">The government responded that Thompson\u2019s attorney, Donnie Bethel, was not ineffective. The government argued that Bethel was not required to call Banks as a witness because her testimony did not conflict with Woods\u2019s testimony about the fanny pack and her testimony would have been perjured. The government referenced an affidavit filed by Bethel explaining that he made a strategic decision not to have Banks testify. Bethel attested that he had interviewed Banks and she had said there was a black fanny pack on Thompson\u2019s seat. Bethel also attested that he chose not to call Banks as a witness for two reasons: Bethel believed Banks\u2019s testimony about the pack would damage Thompson\u2019s defense, and Bethel had \u201cconcluded beyond doubt\u201d that Thompson had instructed Banks to lie and claim ownership of the pack.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-9\">Thompson filed two typewritten \u201crebuttal affidavits\u201d that were signed by his sister, Barbara Thompson, and Banks. Barbara Thompson attested that she rode with Thompson to his revocation hearing and observed Thompson receive a telephone call from Bethel; Bethel told Thompson \u201cnot to bring Ms. Banks to the courthouse\u201d; and Thompson \u201cwas clearly upset and ... surprise[d] that Mr. Bethel did not intend to let Ms. Banks testify.\u201d Banks attested that she \u201c[n]ever stated\u201d to Bethel that \u201cthere was a bag on the seat of ... Thompson\u2019s vehicle at the time of his arrest\u201d; Thompson had not \u201cattempted to persuade her to claim ownership of the bag\u201d; Bethel had told Banks that she would testify at Thompson\u2019s revocation hearing; and Banks overheard Thompson disagree with Bethel\u2019s plan to \u201cpresent [Banks] as an alibi owner of the [fanny pack].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b961-10\">A magistrate judge recommended that the district court deny Thompson\u2019s motion to vacate his sentence. The magistrate judge found that Bethel was not ineffective for failing to call Banks as a witness when Bethel believed Banks would testify falsely. The magistrate judge ruled that Thompson\u2019s argument that Woods planted evidence in his car was not newly discovered and, \u201c[t]o the extent that Thompson [argued] that his counsel was ineffective for failing to pursue a \u2018planted evidence\u2019 defense,\u201d the argument \u201clack[ed] merit.\u201d The magistrate judge found that Bethel\u2019s \u201caffidavit and other aspects of the record\u201d established that Thompson \u201cnever disputed that there was a fanny pack in his car before he was approached by [the] police\u201d and that \u201ccounsel had no reasonable basis for pursuing such a defense at the time of the revocation hearing.\u201d After \u201can independent review of the file,\u201d on February 4, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"934\">*934</page-number>2009, 2009 WL 262859, the district court denied summarily Thompson\u2019s motion to vacate.</p>\n<p id=\"b962-4\">Thompson filed a notice of appeal that challenged the denial of his motion to vacate. In the notice, Thompson argued that he never received a copy of the recommendation of the magistrate judge and he referenced a notice he had filed that, effective February 4, 2009, he should be served at an address in Atlanta, Georgia. The notice was dated February 2, 2009, and was received by the clerk of the district court on February 4, 2009. The district court treated Thompson\u2019s notice of appeal as a motion for a certificate of appealability and denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b962-5\">II. STANDARDS OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b962-6\">On denial of a motion to vacate a sentence, we review findings of fact for clear error and the application of law to those facts <em>de novo. Mamone v. United States, </em>559 F.3d 1209, 1210 (11th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b962-7\">III. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b962-8\">Thompson challenges the ruling of the district court on two grounds. First, Thompson argues that his right to due process was violated because the district court failed to provide notice of the report and recommendation at the Federal Prison Camp in Atlanta, Georgia. Second, Thompson argues that he was entitled to an evidentiary hearing to resolve inconsistencies in the affidavits filed by his girlfriend, Banks, and attorney Bethel. These arguments fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b962-9\">The district court did not violate Thompson\u2019s right to due process. To satisfy the Due Process Clause, \u201cnotice must be \u2018reasonably calculated, under all the circumstances, to apprise interested parties of the pendency of the action and afford them an opportunity to present their objections.\u2019 \u201d <em>Arrington v. Helms, </em>438 F.3d 1336, 1349-50 (11th Cir.2006) (quoting <em>Mullane v. Cent. Hanover Bank &amp; Trust Co., </em>339 U.S. 306, 314, 70 S.Ct. 652, 657, 94 L.Ed. 865 (1950)). The clerk complied with the requirements of due process by providing Thompson notice in compliance with the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Under those rules, the clerk must \u201cpromptly mail a copy\u201d of a report and recommendation, Fed. R. Civ. P. 72(b)(1), to a party\u2019s \u201clast known address,\u201d <em>id. </em>5(b)(2)(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b962-11\">The record establishes that the clerk mailed Thompson a copy of the report and recommendation to his official address of record at the Federal Correctional Institution in Yazoo City, Mississippi. Thompson had listed the Yazoo City address on his complaint and on the next eleven documents that he filed in the district court between November 2007 and May 2008. Although Thompson argues that the clerk was required to mail a copy of the report and recommendation to the Federal Prison Camp address that Thompson had listed on his petition for a writ of mandamus that he filed in October 2008, Thompson continued to receive actual notice at the Yazoo City address. The record establishes that the clerk served Thompson at the Yazoo City address notice that his petition had been denied, and Thompson appealed that decision. The district court provided Thompson sufficient notice. <em>See Dunlap v. Transamerica Occidental Life Ins. Co., </em>858 F.2d 629, 632 (11th Cir.1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b962-12\">The district court also did not abuse its discretion by denying Thompson\u2019s motion to vacate without an evidentiary hearing. The district court was entitled to rely on the information it acquired during Thompson\u2019s revocation hearing to resolve the inconsistencies in the affidavits of Thompson\u2019s attorney, Bethel, and Thompson\u2019s girlfriend, Banks. <em>See United States v. Schlei, </em>122 F.3d 944, 994 (11th Cir.1997) (\u201c \u2018[T]he acumen gained by a tri<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"935\">*935</page-number>al judge over the course of the proceedings [makes him] well qualified to rule on the basis of affidavits without a hearing.\u2019 \u201d) (quoting <em>United States v. Hamilton, </em>559 F.2d 1370, 1373-74 (5th Cir.1977)). The district court was entitled to regard with suspicion Thompson\u2019s argument that his counsel had suppressed exculpatory testimony from Banks that Woods planted the fanny pack in Thompson\u2019s vehicle because Thompson had testified at the revocation hearing and had not disavowed that a fanny pack containing cocaine base and a firearm had been discovered in his vehicle. The testimonies of officers, Lyman, and Thompson about the fanny pack, coupled with the suspect nature of Banks\u2019s affidavits, provided the district court ample reason to deny Thompson an evidentiary hearing. <em>See Holmes v. United States, </em>876 F.2d 1545, 1553 (11th Cir.1989) (\u201cA hearing is not required on patently frivolous claims or .... where the petitioner\u2019s allegations are affirmatively contradicted by the record.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b963-5\">The district court also did not err by denying Thompson\u2019s motion to vacate his sentence. Thompson failed to prove that Bethel made a professional error. <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 2064, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). The district court credited Bethel\u2019s statement that he believed Banks would give false testimony, and we find no clear error in that finding of fact. Bethel\u2019s statement is consistent with statements in the affidavits of Banks and Barbara Thompson that Bethel ordered Thompson not to bring Banks to the courthouse. Bethel was not ineffective because the duty to present a defense does not require that an attorney suborn perjury. <em>See Putman v. Head, </em>268 F.3d 1223, 1246 (11th Cir.2001) (\u201cAlthough an attorney has an ethical duty to advance the interest of her client, that duty is limited by an equally solemn duty to comply with the law and standards of professional conduct.\u201d) (internal quotation marks and alteration omitted); <em>Davis v. Singletary, </em>119 F.3d 1471, 1475 (11th Cir.1997) (\u201cThe duty to render effective assistance of counsel does not include the duty to present false or misleading testimony.\u201d). Bethel also was entitled to choose deliberately not to call Banks as a witness and instead argue that she owned the fanny pack, and we will not second guess Be-thel\u2019s strategic decision. <em>See Chandler v. United States, </em>218 F.3d 1305, 1314 (11th Cir.2000) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b963-7\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b963-8\">The denial of Thompson\u2019s motion to vacate his sentence is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
