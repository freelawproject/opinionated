We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b991-11\">We review <em>de novo </em>conclusions about the scope of the legal authority of the district court under section 3582(c)(2). <em>United States v. Jones, </em>548 F.3d 1366, 1368 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b991-12\">Amendment 706 to the Sentencing Guidelines reduced base offense levels for crack cocaine offenses. If a defendant was responsible for at least 4.5 kilograms of crack cocaine, Amendment 706 does not reduce his applicable guideline range, and he is ineligible for a sentence reduction under section 3582(c)(2). <em>Jones, </em>548 F.3d at 1369. The decision of the Supreme Court in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), does not provide an independent basis to reduce his sentence. <em>Jones, </em>548 F.3d at 1369.</p>\n<p id=\"b991-13\">Hewitt was ineligible for a sentence reduction under section 3582(c)(2). <em>Jones, </em>548 F.3d at 1369. During Hewitt\u2019s original sentencing, the district court adopted the finding in the presentence investigation report that Hewitt was responsible for in excess of 5 kilograms of crack cocaine. We affirm the denial of Hewitt\u2019s motion for a reduction of sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b991-15\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
