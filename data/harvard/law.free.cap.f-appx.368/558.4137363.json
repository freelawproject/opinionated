Dancy, federal prisoner # 97081-079, appeals the grant of an 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) sentence reduction from 150 months to 145 months of imprisonment for possessing with intent to distribute more than 500 grams of cocaine. Dancy argues that, because his original sentence was 29% less than the bottom of his original guidelines range of 210-262 months of imprisonment, the district court erred by failing to grant him a 119 month sentence, which would be 29% less than the bottom of his amended guidelines range of 168-210 months of imprisonment. He argues that in so doing, the district court misapplied U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(b)(2)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b587-13\">Section 3582(c)(2) allows discretionary modification of certain sentences if the sentencing range has been subsequently lowered by the Sentencing Commission. <em>United States v. Doublin, </em>572 F.3d 235, 237 (5th Cir.2009). In such eases, the district court may reduce the sentence after considering the applicable 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors and the applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). Although \u00a7 3582(c) directs the court to consider the sentencing factors of \u00a7 3553(a), \u201cthe bifurcated procedural-soundness, substantive-reasonableness\u201d review derived from <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005) and its progeny does not apply under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>United States v. Evans, </em>587 F.3d 667, 672 (5th Cir.2009). \u201cInstead ... the decision whether to reduce a sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) [is reviewed] for abuse of discretion,\u201d with the district court\u2019s interpretation of the guidelines reviewed de novo and its factual findings reviewed for clear error. <em>Id. </em>at 672 (internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b587-18\">We find unpersuasive Dancy\u2019s argument that his reduced sentence should have been lower than the 145-month term that the district court imposed. Section 1B1.10 provides in relevant part: \u201cIf the original term of imprisonment imposed was less than the term of imprisonment provided by the guideline range applicable to the defendant at the time of sentencing, a reduction comparably less than the amended guideline range ... <em>may </em>be appropriate.\u201d \u00a7 1B1.10(b)(2)(B) (emphasis added). \u201cEven though the district court <em>may </em>grant a comparable sentence reduction, ... it is not compelled to do so.\u201d <em>United States v. Cooley, </em>590 F.3d 293, 297 (5th Cir.2009). Further, commentary accompanying \u00a7 1B1.10 makes clear that \u201cthe sentencing court has the discretion to determine whether, <em>and to tvhat extent, </em>to reduce a term of imprisonment under [\u00a7 lB1.10(b)(2)(B)].\u201d \u00a7 1B1.10, cmt. n. 3 (emphasis added). There is no evidence that the district court intended to grant a greater reduction but erred in its arithmetical calculation, as Dancy intimates.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>Nor was the district court required, as Dancy argues, to explain the rationale for its sentence by making explicit its consideration of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors or other policy considerations. <em>See Evans, </em>587 F.3d at 674. If a district court is \u201cpresented with argument concerning the \u00a7 3553(a) factors,\u201d as occurred in this case, this court may assume that the district court considered the argument. <em>Id. </em>at 673.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-4\">Neither has Dancy shown that the reduced sentence was outside the sound discretion of the district court. <em>United States v. Whitebird, </em>55 F.3d 1007, 1009 (5th Cir.1995). He has merely made the showing that the sentence imposed was not the one he would have preferred. That showing, however, is insufficient to establish that the district court abused its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b587-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
