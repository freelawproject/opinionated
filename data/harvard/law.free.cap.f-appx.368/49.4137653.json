In his complaint, Dees alleged that he was discriminated against and harassed based on his National Guard membership, and that he was ultimately fired because of his National Guard obligations. On appeal, Dees argues that the district court erred in granting summary judgment to HMMA on his termination and harassment claims because: (1) sufficient evidence showed that his military status was a motivating factor in his termination, and the termination committee did not act in good faith since the discriminatory motive underlying a supervisor\u2019s recommendation to fire Dees directly resulted in his termination; and (2) he has standing to bring his USERRA harassment claim since, although he did not suffer lost wages or the loss of other employee benefits as a result of the alleged harassment and an injunction would not provide relief, USERRA provides for \u201cother equitable remedies,\u201d including attorneys\u2019 fees. After thorough review, we affirm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b78-11\">We review a district court order granting summary judgment <em>de novo, </em>viewing all of the facts in the record in a light most favorable to the non-moving party, and drawing all inferences in his favor. <em>Frederick v. Sprint/United Mgmt. Co., </em>246 F.3d 1305, 1311 (11th Cir.2001). \u201cSummary judgment is only proper if there are no genuine disputed issues of material fact, and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201c[M]ere conclusions and unsupported factual allegations are legally insufficient to defeat a summary judgment motion.\u201d <em>Ellis v. England, </em>432 F.3d 1321, 1326 (11th Cir.2005). Generally, we will not consider an issue not raised in the district court. <em>Access Now, Inc. v. Southwest Airlines Co., </em>385 F.3d 1324, 1331 (11th Cir.2004). We review a dismissal for lack of standing <em>de novo. Scott v. Taylor, </em>470 F.3d 1014, 1017 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b78-12\">First, we reject Dees\u2019 argument that the district court erred in granting summary judgment on his termination claim. USERRA provides that a member of the Armed Services \u201cshall not be denied initial employment, reemployment, retention in employment, promotion, or any benefit of employment by an employer on the basis of that membership.\u201d 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 4311(a). Congress enacted USERRA \u201cto encourage noncareer service in the uniformed services by eliminating or minimizing the disadvantages to civilian careers and employment which can result from such service\u201d and \u201cto minimize the disruption to the lives of persons performing service in the uniformed services as well as to their employers.\u201d 38 U.S.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>\u00a7 4301(a)(1), (a)(2). An employer violates these provisions if the employee\u2019s membership in the armed services \u201cis a motivating factor in the employer\u2019s action, unless the employer can prove that the action would have been taken in the absence of such membership.\u201d 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 4311(c)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b79-5\">To establish a <em>prima facie </em>case under USERRA, a plaintiff must \u201cshow by a preponderance of the evidence that his protected status was a motivating factor,\u201d but that status need not be the sole cause as long as \u201cit is one of the factors that a truthful employer would list if asked for the reasons for its decision.\u201d <em>Coffman v. Chugach Support Servs., Inc., </em>411 F.3d 1231, 1238 (11th Cir.2005) (citation and quotation omitted). \u201cIndeed [m]ilitary status is a motivating factor if the defendant relied on, took into account, considered, or conditioned its decision on that consideration.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted). Because \u201cdiscrimination is seldom open or notorious,\u201d circumstantial evidence is critical, and \u201c[t]he court can infer discriminatory motivation under the USERRA from a variety of considerations,\u201d such as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aq1\">proximity in time between the employee\u2019s military activity and the adverse employment action, inconsistencies between the proffered reason and other actions of the employer, an employer\u2019s expressed hostility towards members protected by the statute together with knowledge of the employee\u2019s military activity, and disparate treatment of certain employees compared to other employees with similar work records or offenses.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AGW\"><em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted). \u201cWhen the employee has met this burden, the burden shifts to the employer to prove the affirmative defense that legitimate reasons, standing alone, would have induced the employer to take the same adverse action.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1238-39. Thus, in USERRA actions, \u201cthe [employer] must prove, by a preponderance of evidence, that the action would have been taken despite the protected status.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1239 (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b79-7\">As a general rule, a discharge recommendation by a party with no decision-making power \u201cmay be actionable if the plaintiff proves that the recommendation directly resulted in the [adverse employment action].\u201d <em>See Stimpson v. City of Tuscaloosa, </em>186 F.3d 1328, 1331 (11th Cir.1999) (Title VII case). However, in such cases, \u201ccausation must be truly direct[, and] the plaintiff must prove that the discriminatory animus behind the recommendation, and not the underlying employee misconduct identified in the recommendation, was an actual cause of the other party\u2019s decision to terminate the employee.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In proving that the discriminatory animus caused the adverse employment action, we recognize the \u201ccat\u2019s paw\u201d theory, where \u201ccausation may be established if the plaintiff shows that the decisionmaker followed the biased recommendation [of a nondecisionmaker] without independently investigating the complaint against the employeef, and] ... the recommender is using the decisionmaker as a mere conduit, or \u2018cat\u2019s paw<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> to give effect to the recommender\u2019s discriminatory animus.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1332.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-8\">On the record here, the district court correctly found that Dees failed to establish through direct or circumstantial evidence that HMMA \u201crelied on, took into account, considered, or conditioned its decision\u201d to fire Dees on the basis of his military service. <em>See Coffman, </em>411 F.3d at 1238. Dees admitted that he has no direct evidence that his military status motivated his termination, and denied knowing that a termination committee meeting even took place or who was involved in the decision. Dees testified that he believed he was fired due to his Guard obligations because it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>\u201cseemed\u201d that way and because \u201ceverything stemmed around [his] drill weekends,\u201d but these unsupported conclusory statements are insufficient to survive summary judgment. <em>See </em>Ellis, 432 F.3d at 1326. But evidence established that HMMA was aware of Dees\u2019s military obligations when he was hired in 2005, and that he was never disciplined for missing work due to Guard training. Further, HMMA\u2019s military policy provides for absences due to military obligation, and HMMA even pays the difference between military pay and regular wages for up to a month.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-4\">In addition, despite his assertions on appeal that other HMMA employees harassed him about his military obligations, Dees testified that, other than Greg Prater and John Applegate, no one had said anything to him about his military service. Because these two were the only HMMA supervisors that were openly hostile towards Dees\u2019s military status, only their actions can be used to establish an inference that the termination committee had a discriminatory motive. <em>See Coffman, </em>411 F.3d at 1238 (listing an employer\u2019s open hostility towards an employee\u2019s military status as circumstantial evidence of a discriminatory motive). However, Prater\u2019s actions should not be considered to establish a discriminatory motive for Dees\u2019s termination because Prater was not involved in the ultimate termination decision. Similarly, although Applegate was on the termination committee and recommended termination, Applegate testified that his only role in termination committee proceedings was to appear before it when one of his employees was considered for termination, but that he leaves before the deliberations.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-5\">Dees nonetheless argues that under the \u201ccat\u2019s paw\u201d theory, Applegate\u2019s recommendation to fire Dees directly resulted in his termination. However, we will not consider Dees\u2019s cat\u2019s paw argument because he did not specifically raise it before the district court. <em>See Access Now, Inc., </em>385 F.3d at 1331. Moreover, to the extent that he did raise it, the \u201ccat\u2019s paw\u201d theory is inapplicable in the present case because the termination committee conducted an independent investigation, and no supervisor\u2019s discriminatory recommendation was the direct cause of Dees\u2019s termination. <em>Stimpson, </em>186 F.3d at 1331. Therefore, the district court correctly granted summary judgment to HMMA on Dees\u2019s termination claim under USERRA.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-7\">We also find no merit in Dees\u2019 claim that he had standing to bring his USERRA harassment claim. Standing presents a \u201cthreshold jurisdictional question of whether a court may consider the merits of a dispute.\u201d <em>Elend v. Basham, </em>471 F.3d 1199, 1204 (2006). The three constitutional requirements for standing are as follows: (1) the plaintiff must have suffered or must face an imminent threat of a \u201cconcrete and particularized injury\u201d resulting from \u201can invasion of a legally protected interest,\u201d (2) \u201cthe injury must have been caused by the defendant\u2019s complained-of actions,\u201d and (3) the \u201cinjury or threat of injury must likely be redressible by a favorable court decision.\u201d <em>Fla. State Conference of N.A.A.C.P. v. Browning, </em>522 F.3d 1153, 1159 (11th Cir.2008) (citation and quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b80-8\">USERRA provides that a uniformed service member may not be denied \u201cany benefit of employment.\u201d 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 4311(a). Further, USERRA provides that a court may award three kinds of relief: (1) an injunction requiring an employer to comply with USERRA\u2019s provisions; (2) compensation for lost wages or benefits suffered by reason of the employer\u2019s failure to comply with USERRA, and (3) liquidated damages in an amount equal to lost wages or benefits if the employer\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>failure to comply with USERRA was willful. 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 4323(d)(l)(A)-(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\">Assuming without deciding that harassment or hostile work environment is a cognizable claim under USERRA, Dees lacks standing to bring such a claim. Dees admits that he has not suffered any lost wages or employment benefits resulting from the alleged harassment. Further, an injunction requiring HMMA to comply with USERRA would not benefit Dees as he is no longer an HMMA employee. While Dees relies on non-binding cases to establish that he can be granted \u201cequitable relief,\u201d he only specifically mentions attorneys\u2019 fees. However, the statute provides for three specific remedies for USERRA violations and does not provide for other \u201cequitable relief\u2019 or attorneys\u2019 fees. 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 4323(d)(l)(A)-(C). As such, Dees lacks standing to bring a USERRA harassment claim because he does not allege that he is entitled to any of the relief provided by USERRA. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s grant of HMMA\u2019s motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b78-9\">.
