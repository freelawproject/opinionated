The Commission alleged that the jammers harmfully interfered with authorized radio communications \u2014 a violation of FCC regulations. Rocky Mountain Radar refused to pay, and the dispute found its way to federal court. The district court granted summary judgment to the Commission, requiring Rocky Mountain Radar to remit the penalty. Rocky Mountain Radar appeals, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-19\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-20\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-21\">Congress created the Federal Communications Commission to \u201cexecute and enforce\u201d the Communications Act of 1934.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The legislature \u2014 in the organic statute\u2014 delegated to the agency the authority to make regulations \u201cgoverning the interference potential of devices which in their operation are capable of emitting radio frequency energy by radiation, conduction, or other means in sufficient degree to cause harmful interference to radio communications.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The agency\u2019s regulatory power would extend over the \u201cmanufacture, import, sale, offer for sale, or ship<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>ment of such devices\u201d and \u201cthe use of such devices.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b510-4\">The Commission has exercised its authority to regulate what it calls intentional radiators- \u2014 -\u201cdevice[s] that intentionally generate[ ] and emit[ ] radio frequency....\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Radio frequency energy is \u201c[e]leetromagnetic energy at any frequency in the radio spectrum between 9 kHz and 3,000,000 MHz.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Any seller must receive the Commission\u2019s authorization \u201cpri- or to marketing\u201d an intentional radiator.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Additionally, no radiator \u2014 intentional or otherwise \u2014 may cause \u201charmful interference,\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> which the Commission defines as \u201c[a]ny emission, radiation or induction that endangers the functioning of a radio navigation service or of other safety services or seriously degrades, obstructs or repeatedly interrupts a radio communications service operating in accordance with this chapter.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> As the district court noted, these regulations fulfill Congress\u2019s express intent that \u201c[n]o person shall willfully or maliciously interfere with or cause interference to any radio communications ... licensed or authorized by or under this chapter....\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-6\">The Commission authorizes the police to use radar \u2014 a type of radio energy- \u2014 to enforce traffic laws. Police radar can decipher the speed of moving cars by interpreting a phenomenon beloved by middle-school science teachers everywhere \u2014 the Doppler effect. The police radar system sends a radar signal toward an approaching car. When the radar hits the car, the car\u2019s movement adds an audio signal to the original radar. The combined signal bounces back to the police, where the radar machine removes the radar frequency to process only the remaining audio frequency \u2014 to which the car\u2019s speed is proportional.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b510-15\">Rocky Mountain Radar produces radar jammers, which the company claims will \u201cscramble\u201d police radar.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> According to a Commission expert, all radar jammers \u201cwork in the same basic way.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> When police radar hits a car equipped with a radar jammer, the jammer mixes the incoming signal with an audio signal artificially produced by the jammer. The produced audio signal\u2019s frequency falls below 9 kHz \u2014 and thus outside of the Commission\u2019s regulated frequency range. The jammer then reflects back the original radar signal \u2014 combined not only with the natural audio signal created by all moving objects, but also with the artificially created audio signal. According to Rocky Mountain Radar, the police system \u201cmay become confused at having multiple audio signals to process.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b510-16\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-17\">The Commission has long interpreted radar jammers to be unlawful under its regulations governing harmful interference. In fact, the agency in 1996 issued a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>public notice warning against the use of jammers: \u201cThe intentional use of jammers is considered \u2018malicious interference\u2019 and is strictly prohibited by the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, and by Commission Rules.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b511-5\">Rocky Mountain Radar decided not to heed the Commission\u2019s warning. It continued in the late 1990s to produce its Spirit II line of radar jammers. The Commission cited the company: the Spirit II acted as an intentional radiator designed harmfully to interfere with police radar. The company administratively challenged the determination; the Commission upheld its ruling that the Spirit II violated FCC regulations; and the company appealed the Commission\u2019s final determination to the United States Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit in a case called <em>Rocky Mountain Radar, Inc. v. Federal Communications </em>Commission,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b511-6\">The 10th Circuit described that the Spirit II \u2014 as expected \u2014 \u201creceives a radar signal, then blends the signal with white noise, and confuses the computer inside the radar gun.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The question on judicial review boiled down to whether the Commission could classify radar jammers as intentional radiators \u2014 devices that intentionally generate and emit radio energy. Rocky Mountain Radar urged that the Commission\u2019s conception of the word \u201cgenerate\u201d made no sense \u2014 arguing that \u201cthe Spirit II is not covered by FCC rules regulating radiators of radio frequency energy because the device merely reflects a police radar signal and, by itself, cannot produce radio frequency energy.\u201d <footnotemark>17</footnotemark> According to the company, reflect does not mean generate.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-13\">The Commission countered that \u201cthe fact that the original source of the radio frequency energy is external to the device does not place it beyond the Commission\u2019s jurisdiction.\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Indeed, the jammer \u201cuses the radar signal as a source of RF [ (radio frequency) ] energy, modulates the signal electronically to generate a different RF signal, and emits that RF signal to cause interference to police radars.\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> According to the Commission, the company could find no solace in the fact that it designed the Spirit II \u201cto function only when it is illuminated' by a police radar signal.\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b511-14\">The 10th Circuit agreed and upheld the Commission\u2019s determination that radar jammers operate as harmful intentional radiators, deferring to the agency\u2019s interpretation of its own regulations. The court explained, \u201cWhen an agency applies its regulations to complex or changing circumstances ... this calls upon the agency\u2019s unique expertise and policymaking prerogatives and courts must presume the power authoritatively to interpret its own regulations is a component of the agency\u2019s delegated lawmaking powers.\u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> The 10th Circuit continued, \u201cThe FCC\u2019s decision to give \u2018generate\u2019 a more expansive treatment than that advocated by [the company] is consistent with the ordinary meaning of the term as in \u2018create,\u2019 \u2018produce,\u2019 or \u2018propagate.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> The court opined that \u201ca broad <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>reading of the word furthers a stated aim of the Communications Act .... [and] can also be reconciled with the purpose of the regulations, which is to regulate and minimize interference between users of the electromagnetic spectrum.\u201d<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> In the end, the 10th Circuit did not find the Commission\u2019s order plainly erroneous or inconsistent with regulation.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b512-4\">D.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">The Commission in 2005 learned that the company had produced two new lines of radar jammers \u2014 the RMR-C450 and RMR-S201.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> The Commission asked the company to provide it with information about and samples of the devices. Rocky Mountain Radar complied. After testing, the Commission concluded that both devices \u2014 like the Spirit II \u2014 functioned as intentional radiators designed harmfully to interfere with police radar.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-6\">Regarding the S201: \u201cWhen the scrambler is hit by a [radar] signal it runs it thorough the mixer, adding the FM chirp [audio signal] to mix up the signal and using the antenna, reflect back this new signal to the radar gun.\u201d<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> The Commission explained: \u201cBy definition if an FM chirp generator is mixed with an incoming signal and sent to an antenna, then it is ... an intentional radiator subject to Section 15.209.\u201d<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> The agency concluded that the device \u201cis an [unlicensed] intentional radiator\u201d and \u201cwas designed to intentionally interfere with a licensed radio sendee and is thus in violation of Section 15.5 of our rules.\u201d<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> The Commission found the C450 to work in the same unlawful manner.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b512-16\">The Commission sent the company a Notice of Apparent Liability Forfeiture for $25,000. Rocky Mountain Radar did not respond, so the agency issued a Forfeiture Order directing the company to pay the penalty.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b512-17\">Instead, Rocky Mountain Radar \u2014 oddly enough \u2014 sued the Commission in federal court. The company alleged that the Commission had, among other misdeeds, ignored its request to set aside the forfeiture. The Commission counterclaimed for the payment of $25,000. The district court concluded that it had no jurisdiction over the company\u2019s claims, a ruling that the company does not appeal. The district court did find jurisdiction over the Commission\u2019s counterclaim, noting that an agency may bring a forfeiture action through a de novo trial in federal district court.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b513-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>All parties agreed that the case came down to whether the C450 and S201 are \u201cintentional radiators\u201d under the Commission\u2019s regulations. After motions from both sides, the district court granted the Commission summary judgment. The court held that the facts indisputably showed the company\u2019s jammers to fit the Commission\u2019s regulatory definition of intentional radiators. Rocky Mountain Radar appeals from that final judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-6\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-7\">We must verify that we have jurisdiction, even though no party challenges our ability to hear this appeal.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> Indeed, \u201cevery federal appellate court has a special obligation to satisfy itself not only of its own jurisdiction, but also that of the lower courts in a cause under review, even though the parties are prepared to concede it.\u201d <footnotemark>33</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b513-8\">The Communications Act creates a complicated review process. One federal court has called it a \u201cmaze.\u201d<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> Generally, only a court of appeals has jurisdiction to hear challenges to the Commission\u2019s orders.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> So a judicial attack on the Commission\u2019s regulations (or interpretations thereof) usually has to originate in a circuit court. \u201cThe district courts, however, have a sliver of the jurisdictional pie for enforcement of FCC orders imposing a monetary forfeiture penalty.\u201d<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> Indeed, 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 504(a) establishes that the Commission may bring a de novo forfeiture enforcement action in federal district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-13\">But the district court\u2019s jurisdiction may be limited \u2014 even in a forfeiture action. The district court can hear a factual dispute as to whether a defendant has violated the Commission\u2019s rules. But can the district court hear \u2014 by way of defense\u2014 that the Commission\u2019s rules are themselves unlawful?</p>\n<p id=\"b513-14\">Suppose Broadcaster allegedly violates the Commission\u2019s regulation XYZ. The Commission issues a forfeiture order, but Broadcaster does not pay. The Commission sues in district court to collect. The Commission puts on proof of Broadcaster\u2019s actions that violate XYZ. Broadcaster defends that he did not commit the alleged actions. So far no apparent jurisdictional problem.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-15\">But suppose, too, that Broadcaster argues in the alternative that XYZ violates the Constitution. Broadcaster, in other words, directly challenges the validity of the governing agency regulation \u2014 a claim usually subjected exclusively to appellate review. Does the district court have jurisdiction to hear the defense?</p>\n<p id=\"b513-16\">Our sister circuits have split on the issue.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> On the one hand, the 8th Circuit has held that \u201cto ask the district court to decide whether the regulations are valid violates the statutory requirements.\u201d<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> District courts in the 8th Circuit cannot <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>hear these sorts of challenges even in a de novo forfeiture trial. On the other hand, the 6th Circuit allows its district courts to entertain all relevant subject matters in a Commission forfeiture proceeding.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> Dicta from D.C. Circuit caselaw suggests that it would side with the 6th Circuit.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b514-4\">We need not today decide the question. Read properly, Rocky Mountain Radar before the district court defended that the Commission had failed to establish the necessary facts to prove its jammers to be intentional radiators. According to the company, \u201cThere exist genuine issues of material fact [that the jammers are intentional radiators] to be resolved in a de novo trial as required by statute.\u201d<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> The company on appeal assumes the same posture \u2014 -suggesting that summary judgment cannot stand because factual issues remain unanswered. The company does not challenge the validity of the regulations. The Communications Act expressly authorizes the district court to hear factual disputes in de novo forfeiture collection actions, so we can in this case review the district court\u2019s final judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-6\">We continue to the merits, reviewing de novo the grant of summary judg<em>ment </em>and applying the same standards as the district court.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> \u201cSummary judgment is appropriate where the competent summary judgment evidence demonstrates that there is no genuine issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> Both parties agree that the main issue centers on whether C450 and S201 are \u201cintentional radiators\u201d under the Commission\u2019s regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-10\">The Commission ran three tests on each of the jammers, and Rocky Mountain Radar argues that the tests\u2019 results do not provide sufficient evidence for summary judgment \u2014 and neither do the Commission\u2019s conclusory interpretations of those results. One test involved a police radar gun aimed at a jammer-equipped car as it drove down the road. According to the company, the police radar machine correctly read the car\u2019s speed, so the jammer must not interfere with police radar \u2014 and cannot be an intentional radiator.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-11\">Ultimately, though, no issues of material fact remain that the jammers fit the regulatory definition of intentional radiators\u2014 notwithstanding the possibility of either the jammers\u2019 inefficacy or the inconclusiveness of any test results. Rocky Mountain Radar\u2019s founder and owner admitted\u2014 both in an expert report<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> and at deposition<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number><footnotemark>45</footnotemark> \u2014 that the jammers work by receiving a radar signal, mixing the signal with an audio frequency, and through an antenna reflecting the new conglomerate signal back to the police unit.<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> Jammers that function in this way meet the regulatory definition of an intentional radiator \u2014 something the company has known since the 10th Circuit twelve years ago handed down its decision in <em>Rocky Mountain Radar</em><footnotemark><em>47</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-6\">By the company\u2019s own admissions, there is no dispute of material fact that Rocky Mountain Radar\u2019s unlicensed police jam-mers generate and emit radio energy. The company designed its jammers to interfere with police radio communications, and \u2014 by obstructing law enforcement\u2019s effort to keep our roads free from careless drivers \u2014 the company endangers the public\u2019s safety. The Commission\u2019s regulations expressly forbid all of this. The district court did not err in granting summary judgment to the Commission and ordering the company to pay the forfeiture.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b509-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.

The company stresses in its briefs that intentional radiators must emit \u201cradio\" energy \u2014 but that the Commission never measured the frequency of the signal reflected by the jammers. According to the company, the Commission thus has failed to establish one of the factual predicates for classifying a device as an intentional radiator. A specious argument to be sure, because the company admits in its expert report that the reflected signal falls within the radio range of the electromagnetic spectrum. <em>See </em>R. at 93 (\u201cThe FCC argues that the scrambler changes the radio energy it intercepts. This is completely true. Any moving object in existence will also change the radio energy reflected back to the radar gun.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"47\">\n<p id=\"b515-23\">.We, of course, adopt the 10th Circuit's reasoning that the \"ordinary meaning\u201d of the word \u201cgenerate\u201d includes the type of action performed by radar jammers. <em>See Rocky Mountain Radar, </em>158 F.3d at 1124. It is of no moment that the police radar is the first source of radio energy. Consider this dictionary example: Mountain ranges \"generate\u201d more heat than low-lying plains. <em>See </em>Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary of the English Language Unabridged 945 (1961). It is the sun in this example \u2014 like the police radar in our case \u2014 that is the first source of energy, and radar jammers do more work than inert mountains to generate energy.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
