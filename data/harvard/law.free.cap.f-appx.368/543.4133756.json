Fisher, federal prisoner # 07949-043, appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his motion for a reduction of sentence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2), based upon the amendments United States Sentencing Guidelines that reduced the base offense levels for offenses involving crack cocaine. <em>See United States v. Doublin, </em>572 F.3d 235, 236 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 517, 175 L.Ed.2d 366 (2009). Fisher was convicted following a jury trial of distributing crack <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>cocaine and was sentenced to a 168-month term of imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-4\">Fisher argues that the district court abused its discretion in denying his motion for a reduction in sentence. He acknowledges that district courts may consider post sentencing behavior when deciding \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motions, but he argues that the district court should not have denied his motion solely on the basis of his post sentencing conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">\u201cSection 3582(c)(2) permits a district court to reduce a term of imprisonment ... if such a reduction is consistent with the policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d <em>United States v. Gonzalez-Balderas, </em>105 F.3d 981, 982 (5th Cir.1997). Although \u00a7 3582(c) directs the court to consider the sentencing factors of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), the reasonableness standard derived from <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), does not apply under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>See United States v. Evans, </em>587 F.3d 667, 671-72 (5th Cir.2009), <em>petition for cert. filed </em>(Jan. 28, 2010) (No. 09-8939). The sentencing court is under no obligation to reduce the sentence at all. <em>Evans, </em>587 F.3d at 673. We review the decision whether to reduce a sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Cooley, </em>590 F.3d 293, 295 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b572-6\">In exercising its discretion under <em>\u00a7 3582 </em>(c)(2), the district court is instructed to consider (1) the <em>\u00a7 3553 </em>(a) factors, (2) \u201cthe nature and seriousness of the danger to any person or the community that may be posed by a reduction in the defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment\u201d and (3) \u201cpost-sentencing conduct of the defendant that occurred after imposition of the original term of imprisonment.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, comment, (n. 1(B)(ii) \u2014 (iii)). The district court may also consider the mov-ant\u2019s record of prison misconduct. <em>See United States v. Smith, </em>595 F.3d 1322, 1323 (5th Cir.2010). In denying Fisher\u2019s motion, the district court expressly considered these factors, emphasizing Fisher\u2019s criminal history and that Fisher had numerous prison disciplinary infractions. The district court did not abuse its discretion in declining to reduce Fisher\u2019s sentence. <em>See Cooley, </em>590 F.3d at 295.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b571-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
