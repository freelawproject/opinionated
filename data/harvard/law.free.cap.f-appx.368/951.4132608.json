On appeal, he argues that law enforcement officials lacked probable cause to arrest him, and therefore, evidence of the cocaine discovered on his person when he was arrested should be suppressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b979-26\">We affirm, finding no reversible error in the district court\u2019s finding that law enforcement officials had probable cause to arrest Noland. The facts indicated that Noland had been present at a meeting where agents discussed purchasing marijuana with Bryan Roth and Duane Levin-dowski. A previously reliable informant then informed the agents that \u201cMatt,\u201d was a pool cleaning partner with Roth and a possible supplier of cocaine to Roth. No-land later drove Roth to a meeting where <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"952\">*952</page-number>Roth sold the agents 100 ecstasy pills. When Roth\u2019s apartment was placed under surveillance, Noland was observed there prior to Roth\u2019s call to the agents arranging to sell them more drugs. At one point, Noland was observed getting out of his car, concealing a small white object under his shirt and walking into Roth\u2019s apartment after Roth had arranged to get more drugs for the agents. A short time later Roth exited carrying a red and white package and entered his car. After Roth was arrested at the meeting, Noland \u201cagitatedly]\u201d called Roth\u2019s cell phone repeatedly within a short period of time. Under the totality of the circumstances, the cumulative weight of all of these observations is sufficient to support probable cause to arrest Noland on the belief that he had committed a crime. Accordingly, his arrest was lawful and the cocaine found on his person was admissible into evidence incident to his lawful arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b980-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
