Umude-Louis argues that: (1) the BIA erroneously concluded that it lacked jurisdiction; (2) the immigration judge clearly erred by affirming the Asylum Officer\u2019s negative reasonable fear determination; and (3) the record does not support the Asylum Officer\u2019s conclusions and negative reasonable fear determination. He additionally moves for this court to appoint counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-19\">I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b573-20\">Umude-Louis was admitted to the United States on September 29, 1983, as a nonimmigrant student. After his status as a student was terminated by his school in 1985, Umude-Louis remained in the United States without authorization. Between August 2000 and June 2002, Umude-Louis pleaded guilty to several counts of larceny and related offenses. As a result of his criminal convictions, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) initiated expedited administrative removal proceedings for aggravated felons, pursuant to INA \u00a7 238(b), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1228(b). On August 21, 2008, ICE served Umude-Louis a Final Administrative Removal Order, finding that he was an alien, that he was not a lawful permanent resident of the United States, that he had been convicted of an aggravated felony and was, therefore, removable as an alien convicted of an aggravated felony, pursuant to INA \u00a7 237(a)(2)(A)(iii), 8 U.S.C. 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b574-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>Umude-Louis requested withholding of removal based on a fear of persecution in Nigeria. He was referred to an Asylum Officer for a voluntary reasonable fear interview, which was conducted and recorded in writing on January 7, 2009. During the interview, Umude-Louis claimed that he feared persecution in Nigeria based on his alleged political activities in that country during the years 1979-1981. The following day, the Asylum Officer filed a detailed written \u201cReasonable Fear Determination,\u201d in which he concluded that Umude-Louis\u2019s claims of political activity and persecution were \u201cimplausible\u201d and \u201cirreconcilable\u201d with factual information on country conditions in the record. The Asylum Officer also indicated that \u201c[Petitioner\u2019s] testimony was found not credible in material respects.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b574-4\">Umude-Louis requested a review of the Asylum Officer\u2019s negative Reasonable Fear Determination by an immigration judge (IJ). On March 17, 2009, the IJ issued a Final Order affirming the Asylum Officer\u2019s negative Reasonable Fear Determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">Umude-Louis then filed an appeal with the BIA, arguing the merits of his withholding of removal claim. On April 14, 2009, the BIA issued a one-paragraph decision, noting that based on \u201cControlling federal regulations [which] provide that no appeal lies from an IJ\u2019s decision reviewing a negative Reasonable Fear Determination,\u201d and dismissed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-6\">On April 22, 2009, Umude-Louis filed his petition with this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-7\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b574-8\">This court reviews its own jurisdiction de novo. <em>Nehme v. INS, </em>252 F.3d 415, 420 (5th Cir.2001). We also review legal issues de novo. <em>Ogbemudia v. INS, </em>988 F.2d 595, 598 (5th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b574-12\">A. Expedited Administrative Removal of Aggravated Felons</p>\n<p id=\"b574-13\">Under INA \u00a7 238(b), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1228(b), the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) may determine deporta-bility and issue a Final Administrative Removal Order in the case of an alien who is not lawfully admitted for permanent residence and who has been convicted of committing an aggravated felony. Judicial review of Final Administrative Removal Orders is conducted pursuant to INA \u00a7 242, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> INA \u00a7 238(b)(3), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1228(b)(3); <em>see Flores-Ledezma v. Gonzales, </em>415 F.3d 375, 379 (5th Cir.2005). Thus, INA \u00a7 238(b) applies to aliens who are not lawful permanent residents and allows DHS to determine the removability of such aliens under INA \u00a7 237(a)(2)(A)(iii), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii), and issue a removal order without referring the case to an IJ (unless the alien requests referral to an IJ). INA \u00a7 238(b), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1228(b); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.31.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-15\">An alien who is subject to a Final Administrative Removal Order issued under INA \u00a7 238(b), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1228(b) is ineligible for any relief from removal that is discretionary with the Attorney General. INA \u00a7 238(b)(5), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1228(b)(5). However, the alien is not barred from non-discretionary relief, such as withholding of removal pursuant to INA \u00a7 241(b)(3), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3), under which the Attorney General may not remove an alien from the United States if the alien\u2019s life or freedom would be threatened on account of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">If the alien requests withholding of removal, as Umude-Louis did in the instant ease, DHS must refer the case to an Asylum Officer, who conducts a Reasonable Fear Determination. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 208.31(b), 238.1(f)(3). If the Asylum Officer determines that the alien has a reasonable fear of persecution or torture, the Asylum Officer must refer the case to an IJ. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 208.31(e). However, if the Asylum Officer makes a negative Reasonable Fear Determination, the alien may request referral to an IJ for review of the negative Reasonable Fear Determination. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 208.31(g), 1208.31(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b575-7\">The regulations provide that, if the IJ \u201cconcurs with the asylum officer\u2019s determination that the alien does not have a reasonable fear of persecution or torture, the case shall be returned to the Service for removal of the alien.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1208.31(g)(1). Further, the regulation expressly provides: \u201cNo appeal shall lie from the immigration judge\u2019s decision.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>Accordingly, in such instances, there is no appeal available to the BIA, and the IJ\u2019s Final Order is the final agency action, because it is the end of the administrative review of DHS\u2019s Final Administrative Removal Order. <em>Id. </em>The alien may then seek judicial review of the IJ\u2019s final order and the underlying Final Administrative Removal Order by timely filing a petition for review in a Circuit Court.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b575-9\">B. Lack of Jurisdiction to Review the IJ\u2019s Final Order</p>\n<p id=\"b575-10\">A petition for review must be filed not later than thirty days after the date of the final order of removal. INA \u00a7 242(b)(1), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(1); <em>Salazar-Regino v. Trominski, </em>415 F.3d 436, 446 n. 17 (5th Cir.2005); <em>Roy v. Ashcroft, </em>389 F.3d 132, 135 (5th Cir.2004). A timely petition for review of a final order of removal is \u201cmandatory and jurisdictional.\u201d <em>Stone v. INS, </em>514 U.S. 386, 405, 115 S.Ct. 1537, 131 L.Ed.2d 465 (1995); <em>Navarro-Miranda v. Ashcroft, </em>330 F.3d 672, 676 (5th Cir.2003) (\u201cThis deadline is jurisdictional.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b575-11\">In this case, the IJ\u2019s Final Order of March 17, 2009, was the final agency decision regarding the Asylum Officer\u2019s negative Reasonable Fear Determination and DHS\u2019s underlying Final Administrative Removal Order, because the regulations provide that \u201c[n]o [administrative] appeal shall lie from the immigration judge\u2019s decision.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.31(g)(1). Therefore, if Umude-Louis desired to seek judicial review of the Final Administrative Removal Order, his petition for review was due thirty days after the IJ\u2019s March 17, 2009 Final Order, on Wednesday, April 16, 2009. INA \u00a7 242(b)(1), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(1). However, Umude-Louis did not file the instant petition for review until April 22, 2009 \u2014 six days after the statutory deadline.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>Umude-Louis provides no legal basis for this court to assert jurisdiction over his petition insofar as it challenges the IJ\u2019s March 17, 2009 Final Order or the underlying DHS Final Administrative Removal Order of August 19, 2008. Accordingly, because Umude-Louis filed his petition for review outside the thirty-day jurisdictional deadline permitted under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(1), the court lacks jurisdiction insofar as Umude-Louis challenges the IJ\u2019s Final Order of March 17, 2009.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-4\">C. The BIA Properly Dismissed the Appeal for Lack of Jurisdiction</p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">Under the controlling regulation at 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.31(g)(1), the BIA\u2019s April 14, 2009 decision correctly and properly dismissed Umude-Louis\u2019s appeal for lack of jurisdiction, and, accordingly, declined to address any of the merits of his claim for withholding of removal. The record demonstrates \u2014 and Umude-Louis does not contest \u2014 that the BIA followed the applicable regulation in dismissing the appeal for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-6\">As discussed above, the regulations provide that if an \u201cimmigration judge concurs with the asylum officer\u2019s determination that the alien does not have a reasonable fear of persecution or torture ... [n]o appeal shall lie from the immigration judge\u2019s decision.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.31(g)(1). In the instant case, the IJ\u2019s Final Order of March 17, 2009, affirmed the negative Reasonable Fear Determination and returned the case to the DHS \u201cfor removal of the alien.\u201d Further, that Final Order clearly stated on its face that \u201c[tjhere [was] no appeal available.\u201d Thus, the IJ\u2019s Final Order properly and correctly applied the controlling regulation, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b576-7\">If the immigration judge concurs with the asylum officer\u2019s determination that the alien does not have a reasonable fear of persecution or torture, the case shall be returned to the Service for removal of the alien. No appeal shall lie from the immigration judge\u2019s decision.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b576-9\">8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.31(g)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b576-10\">In spite of the clear notice to Umude-Louis of the finality of the IJ\u2019s March 17, 2009 Final Order and the unavailability of further administrative review, Umude-Louis declined to seek judicial review of the Final Order and instead filed an appeal with the BIA, seeking review of the merits of his withholding of removal claim. The BIA properly dismissed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction, stating that in such circumstances, \u201c[controlling federal regulations provide that no appeal lies from an Immigration Judge\u2019s decision reviewing a negative Reasonable Fear Determination.\u201d <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.31(g)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b576-11\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b576-12\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is dismissed in part and denied in remaining part. The motion to appoint counsel is also denied.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b573-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
