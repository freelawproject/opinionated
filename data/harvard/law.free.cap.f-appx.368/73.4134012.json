Rotte, proceeding pro <em>se, </em>filed a civil action against the United States for alleged unlawful action by the Internal Revenue Service (\u201cIRS\u201d), in violation of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 6511, 6502, 6334, and 6211, and seeking damages under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 7432, 7433. Rotte now appeals the district court\u2019s orders granting partial summary judgment in favor of the United States, and dismissing for failure to prosecute those claims that survived summary judgment. On appeal, Rotte fails to present any argument regarding the district court\u2019s orders, and notes only in passing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>that \u201che was not given much time\u201d to explain his case, the court was \u201cnegligent\u201d in not considering the totality of his claims, and opposing counsel was \u201cvague and deceptive.\u201d The remainder of Rotte\u2019s brief concerns tax years that were not at issue before the district court, and makes unrelated allegations of fraud and deceit. In his reply brief, Rotte asserts for the first time, without argument, that the district court abused its discretion is dismissing his claims for failure to prosecute, the court did not give adequate consideration to his claims, and the IRS engaged in unauthorized collection activities in 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-4\"><em>\u201cPro se </em>pleadings are held to a less stringent standard than pleadings drafted by attorneys and will, therefore, be liberally construed.\u201d <em>See Trawinski v. United Techs., </em>313 F.3d 1295, 1297 (11th Cir.2002) (quotation omitted). However, \u201cissues not briefed on appeal by a <em>pro se </em>litigant are deemed abandoned.\u201d <em>Timson v. Sampson, </em>518 F.3d 870, 874 (11th Cir.), cert. <em>denied, </em>- U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 74, 172 L.Ed.2d 67 (2008). Furthermore, we do not consider arguments raised for the first time in a <em>pro se </em>litigant\u2019s reply brief. <em>See Lovett v. Ray, </em>327 F.3d 1181, 1182-83 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b102-6\">Because Rotte offers no argument concerning the orders from which he is appealing, he has abandoned all claims on appeal. Furthermore, although he makes brief assertions related to the orders in his reply brief, we do not address these arguments because they were raised for the first time in his reply brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-7\">Upon review of the record and consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs, we affirm the district court\u2019s grant of partial summary judgment in favor of the government and the dismissal of Rotte\u2019s remaining claims for failure to prosecute.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-11\">AFFIRMED.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b102-8\">. Rotte\u2019s request for oral argument is denied as is his motion to request permission to amend appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
