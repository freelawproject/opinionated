Green was originally sentenced as a career offender under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Bl.l(b)(B) to a below-Guidelines sentence of 168 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-7\">Green contends that Amendment 706 applies to this case because the district court, by originally sentencing him below the guidelines range, \u201cimplied that the career offender provisions were not totally applicable,\u201d and, thus, did not sentence him as a career offender. Alternatively, Green contends that <em>United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323 (11th Cir.2008), <em>cert. denied, McFadden v. United States, </em>\u2014\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 965, 173 L.Ed.2d 156, <em>and cert. denied, </em>\u2014\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 129 S.Ct. 1601, 173 L.Ed.2d 689 (2009), was wrongly decided.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-10\">Any sentence reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) must be \u201cconsistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). The commentary to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10 provides that \u201ca reduction in the defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment is not authorized under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) and is not consistent with this policy statement if\u2019 a retroactive amendment applies to the defendant but \u201cdoes not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range because of the operation of another guideline or statutory provision.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, comment, (n. 1(A)). A defendant sentenced pursuant to an offense level determined by U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1 of the Guidelines is not entitled to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) relief because Amendments 706 and 713 do not lower the applicable guideline range for such cai'eer offenders. <em>Moore, </em>541 F.3d at 1327.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-12\">The fact that Green was sentenced below the guidelines range does not mean that his offense level and guidelines range was not determined by the career provision of \u00a7 4B1.1 of the guidelines. He was sentenced as a career offender under \u00a7 4B1.1 and not under \u00a7 2D1.1, even though the court, after calculating his guidelines range varied downward under \u00a7 3553(a) to recognize Green\u2019s attempts to find employment. In sentencing Green the district court rejected his contention that he should not be sentenced as a career offender. As he conceded in the district court, even with a 2-level reduction in his base offense level under Amendment 706, his guidelines range would have remained the same; it would have because of the career offender provision. And because Green was sentenced as a career offender, he was ineligible for \u00a7 3582(c)(2) relief under Amendment 706. <em>See Moore, </em>541 F.3d at 1327.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-13\">We are bound to follow our prior binding precedent in <em>Moore </em>unless and until it is overruled by us <em>en banc </em>or by the Supreme Court. <em>United States v. Vega-Castillo, </em>540 F.3d 1235, 1236 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b69-14\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
