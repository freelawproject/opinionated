He raises one issue on appeal. Carino, who was 48 years old at the time of trial, contends that the district court failed to conduct a Rule 403 balancing before admitting his sister\u2019s testimony that he sexually molested her when he was 16 and she was 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-20\">We review the district court\u2019s evidentia-ry rulings for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Breitweiser, </em>357 F.3d 1249, 1254 (11th Cir.2004). Generally, \u201cpropensity\u201d evidence is inadmissible. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Evid. 404(b) (\u201cEvidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts is not admissible to prove the character of a person in order to show action in conformity therewith.\u201d). An exception exists, however, for \u201cchild molestation\u201d cases. Fed.R.Evid. 414(a) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b957-21\">In a criminal case in which the defendant is accused of an offense of child molestation, evidence of the defendant\u2019s commission of another offense or offenses of child molestation is admissible, and may be considered for its bearing on any matter to which it is relevant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b957-22\">Rule 414(d)(2) provides that an \u201coffense of child molestation\u201d includes possession of visual depictions of child pornography, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252(a)(4)(B), and receiving visual depictions of child pornography, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252(a)(2), both of which are offenses within Chapter 110 of Title 18. It follows <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"930\">*930</page-number>that in prosecutions for possession or receiving child pornography evidence that a defendant has engaged in child molestation in the past is admissible as evidence that he is more likely to have committed the offense charged. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Evid. 414(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b958-3\">Evidence admissible under Rule 414 must also meet the requirements of other provisions of the Federal Rules of Evidence, including Rule 403. While we have not addressed the issue of whether Rule 403 applies to Rule 414, other circuits have held that Rule 403 applies to Rule 414. <em>See United States v. Kelly, </em>510 F.3d 433 (4th Cir.2007); <em>United States v. Stout, </em>509 F.3d 796 (6th Cir.2007); <em>United States v. Hawpetoss, </em>478 F.3d 820 (7th Cir.2007); <em>United States v. LeCompte, </em>131 F.3d 767 (8th Cir.1997); <em>United States v. LeMay, </em>260 F.3d 1018 (9th Cir.2001); <em>United States v. Castillo, </em>140 F.3d 874 (10th Cir.1998). Those circuits vary some in their views about the factors to be considered under Rule 403 before admitting evidence pursuant to Rule 414. <em>See generally Kelly, </em>510 F.3d at 437 n. 3 (discussing differing views of various circuits). But we do not have to choose between those views in this case, because Carino challenges only whether the district court considered Rule 403 at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-4\">Contrary to Carino\u2019s position, the district court did consider Rule 403 and did undertake the balancing required by that rule before admitting Carino\u2019s sister\u2019s testimony under Rule 414. Both the government and Carino, on multiple occasions, argued about how the court should balance the testimony\u2019s probative value with its prejudicial impact. In its trial brief, the government argued that the court must \u201cbalance [the] probative value against the risk of unfaii\u2019 prejudice and any other pertinent Rule 403 factor.\u201d In making that argument, the government acknowledged the prejudicial nature of the evidence but contended that it was not unfairly prejudicial. Before his sister testified, Carino, citing <em>Kelly, </em>argued that for a similar act to be admitted, the act must still pass a \u201ca 403 balancing test.\u201d He cited to the court the factors that the Fourth Circuit had considered in <em>Kelly </em>and he contended that under this \u201cRule 403 balancing as to similarity and time alone that the allegations of [his sister] are not admissible.... \u201d Further, while discussing proposed jury instructions, Carino admitted \u201cthat the Court had considered the factors of 403 in admitting [the testimony] just as it would consider the factors in admitting something under 404(b).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b958-6\">It is clear to us from the record that in deciding to admit the testimony of Carino\u2019s sister, the district court undertook the Rule 403 inquiry and considered each parties\u2019 arguments as to the testimony\u2019s probative value and prejudicial impact.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
