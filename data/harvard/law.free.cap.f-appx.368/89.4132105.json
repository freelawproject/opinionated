He challenges both the district court\u2019s denial of his motion for a mistrial and the denial of his motion for judgment of acquittal.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-21\">During trial, the government asked defense witness Antonio Rutledge: \u201cAre you aware that the defendant was convicted of possession of marijuana?\u201d The court interjected and determined that the question was inadmissible. Defense counsel then objected and moved for a mistrial. The court denied the motion for a mistrial and gave the following curative instruction: \u201cI am instructing you to disregard the last question of the government and not to draw an inference from it.\u201d At the close of all the evidence, the jury found Gray guilty on both counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-22\">\n<em>I. Denial of Motion for Mistrial</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b118-23\">Gray argues that the district court erred in denying his motion for a mistrial because the government asked an impermissible question during its cross-examination of Rutledge. Gray maintains that the court\u2019s curative instruction did not alleviate the prejudice caused by the improper question.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-24\">We review a district court\u2019s refusal to grant a mistrial for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Trujillo, </em>146 F.3d 838, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>845 (11th Cir.1998). \u201cThe decision of whether to grant a mistrial lies within the sound discretion of a trial judge as he or she is in the best position to evaluate the prejudicial effect of improper testimony.\u201d <em>United States v. Perez, </em>30 F.3d 1407, 1410 (11th Cir.1994). \u201cWhen a curative instruction has been given to address some improper and prejudicial evidence, we will reverse only if the evidence \u2018is so highly prejudicial as to be incurable by the trial court\u2019s admonition.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>United States v. Funt, </em>896 F.2d 1288, 1295 (11th Cir.1990)).</p>\n<p id=\"b119-5\">In this case, the district court did not abuse its discretion by denying Gray\u2019s motion for a mistrial because the government\u2019s question was not incurably prejudicial. The district court prevented the witness from answering the question, handled the matter outside the presence of the jury, and then properly instructed the jury to disregard the question. Accordingly, the district court\u2019s immediate curative instruction was sufficient to mitigate any prejudice that may have resulted, and the court did not abuse its discretion by denying Gray\u2019s motion for a mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-6\">\n<em>II. Sufficiency of the Evidence</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b119-7\">Gray next argues that the district court committed reversible error by denying his motion for judgment of acquittal because the government failed to present sufficient evidence that he was the person who sold the cocaine to a confidential informant, Stephen Bell. Gray asserts that Bell was the only witness to the actual transaction, and Bell\u2019s testimony was not credible because he was granted probation based on his assistance to the government. Moreover, Gray submits, Bell\u2019s testimony was incredible because he \u201casserted the Fifth Amendment when asked if he was still selling drugs at the time of the trial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"A8L\">\u201cSufficiency of the evidence is a question of law reviewed <em>de novo. </em>We, however, view the evidence in the light most favorable to the government, with all reasonable inferences and credibility choices made in the government\u2019s favor.\u201d <em>United States v. Martinez, </em>83 F.3d 371, 373-74 (11th Cir.1996) (internal citations omitted). \u201cIn order to find the evidence sufficient, we need not exclude every reasonable hypothesis of innocence or find the evidence wholly inconsistent with every conclusion except that of guilt, provided that a reasonable factfinder could find that the evidence establishes guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>United States v. Kelly, </em>888 F.2d 732, 740 (11th Cir.1989). Credibility determinations are for the jury to make, and we typically will not review such determinations. <em>United States. v. Copeland, </em>20 F.3d 412, 413 (11th Cir.1994). \u201cThe test for sufficiency of evidence is identical regardless of whether the evidence is direct or circumstantial, and no distinction is to be made between the weight given to either direct or circumstantial evidence.\u201d <em>United States v. Mieres-Borges, </em>919 F.2d 652, 656-57 (11th Cir.1990) (internal quotations omitted). In order to convict a defendant of distribution of cocaine, the government must prove that the defendant \u201cknowingly or intentionally ... distributed] ... a controlled substance.\u201d 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b119-9\">Here, the evidence was sufficient to convict Gray of two counts of distributing cocaine. First, Bell testified that Gray sold him the drugs, and \u201call reasonable inferences and credibility choices are viewed in the light most favorable to the government.\u201d Despite Gray\u2019s contention to the contrary, Bell\u2019s testimony \u2014 corroborated by multiple exhibits and the testimony of multiple law enforcement officers\u2014 was not incredible as a matter of law. Several detectives described in great detail the surveillance measures that were used <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>to record what happened at the controlled drug purchases. Thus, there was a sufficient basis for a reasonable trier of fact to determine that Gray knowingly and intentionally distributed cocaine on June 30 and August 2, 2006. Accordingly, Gray\u2019s challenge to his convictions fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
