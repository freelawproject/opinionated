Cooper appeals the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of Defendant-Appellee United Parcel Service, Inc., on his race and disability discrimination claims. Cooper alleges that the Defendant-Appellee failed to make reasonable accommodations for his disability, took adverse employment actions against him on the basis of his race and disability, and retaliated against him in response to his claims of discrimination. On appeal, Cooper challenges the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of the Defendant-Appellee on all claims. For the following reasons, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-6\">I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b499-7\">Cooper, an African-American, worked for United Parcel Service, Inc. (UPS), for approximately seventeen years. Prior to Hurricane Katrina, Cooper lived and worked in the New Orleans, Louisiana, area. Cooper\u2019s home was destroyed by the storm and he moved to Baton Rouge, Louisiana, though he continued to commute to New Orleans to work as a \u201cpreload supervisor\u201d at the UPS warehouse. Cooper claims that, after his move to Baton Rouge, he requested to be transferred to a UPS facility in Baton Rouge and to be moved to a position in \u201cplant engineering.\u201d Sometime in mid-2006, Cooper claims that UPS asked him and a white employee to use their personal vehicles to deliver packages. Cooper alleges that he and the white employee refused to comply with this request. In August 2006, Cooper was transferred to a UPS center in Harvey, Louisiana, to work as an \u201con-road supervisor.\u201d Cooper complied with the transfer. However, Cooper alleges that the transfer to Harvey added over 25 minutes of additional transit time to each leg of his commute, and he claims that UPS moved him to Harvey because he refused to use his personal vehicle for deliveries. Cooper further claims that this transfer was racially motivated because UPS did not also move the white employee to Harvey or \u201cdo anything to him,\u201d despite the fact that the white employee also objected to using his personal vehicle for deliveries.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-10\">Also in August 2006, Cooper began to suffer from heat exhaustion, muscle spasms, dizziness, and headaches while working. Cooper consulted an occupational doctor, Jimmy Guidry, and was diagnosed with heat stroke, post-traumatic stress disorder, and migraine headaches brought on by heat, depression, and anxiety. Dr. Guidry recommended that Cooper avoid high heat and high-stress situations and that he take a medical leave of absence from his job. Cooper began his medical leave of absence on August 27, 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-11\">While on leave, Cooper continued to receive his salary from August 2006 through March 2007 pursuant to UPS\u2019s Income Protection Plan (the \u201cIncome Protection Plan\u201d or the \u201cPlan\u201d). Under the Income Protection Plan, eligible employees receive all or a portion of their salary while absent from work because of illness or accidental injury. However, the Plan also provides that an employee is subject to \u201cadministrative separation\u201d if he is absent from work for twelve months.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-12\">Cooper also sought treatment from Larry Gooch, a licensed social worker, and Dr. Gregory Ferrara, his primary care physician. Cooper\u2019s medical experts released him to work with restrictions in January 2007. Specifically, they recommended <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>that Cooper avoid significant daily driving, excessive heat and humidity, and high-stress situations. In January 2007, Cooper showed up to work and presented his requests for accommodations to UPS. According to Cooper, UPS denied these requests for accommodations and only offered to place him in jobs that involved performing functions that he was restricted from performing. Cooper did not resume work at this time, claiming that he could not perform the requirements of his prior position without accommodation. Cooper then filed a formal request for accommodations.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-4\">In February 2007, UPS notified Cooper that it had received his request for accommodations, and it requested supporting information in order to evaluate Cooper\u2019s request. In March 2007, Cooper presented evaluations from Dr. Judith Levy, a clinical psychologist, and Gooch.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Both Dr. Levy and Gooch stated that Cooper was currently unable to perform the duties of his job. They recommended that Cooper work in a climate-controlled environment; at a job closer to his home; in a \u201cnew environment\u201d with a new boss; and in a job that would utilize his engineering education. Further, they recommended that Cooper not drive long distances. Both also stated that there were no medications or corrective devices that would allow Cooper to perform all the duties required by his current position. In response, UPS requested official forms from these physicians, which Cooper provided in April 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-5\">On September 11, 2007, UPS notified Cooper that he was subject to administrative separation \u2014 i.e., termination' \u2014 under the Income Protection Plan because he had been absent from work for twelve months. The notification letter further states that UPS hoped that Cooper would return to his position, thus avoiding administrative separation under the Plan. Cooper did not return to work and did not submit further medical information regarding his disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-9\">On August 13, 2008, UPS again notified Cooper that he had been on leave for nearly two years and stated that it had concluded, based on the information Cooper submitted, that he was not disabled and that he must return to work as an on-road supervisor by August 25, 2008, or provide additional requested medical information in support of his disability claims. UPS also informed Cooper that he would be subject to administrative separation if he did not comply. Cooper neither returned to work nor provided further medical information regarding his disability claims. UPS notified Cooper that he had been administratively separated, pursuant to the Plan, on August 27, 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-10\">While Cooper was absent from work, he filed an Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) charge on May 2, 2007, alleging that he was disabled and that UPS denied him reasonable accommodations. In July 2007, he supplemented this charge with a memorandum to the EEOC in which he also alleged race discrimination. On January 2, 2008, Cooper filed a formal charge of race discrimination with the EEOC. Cooper received his right to sue letter and filed suit against UPS on April 10, 2008. Relevant here, Cooper alleged that his transfer to Harvey was an adverse <em>employment </em>action that was racially motivated; that UPS discharged him on the basis of his race; that UPS failed to make reasonable accommodations for his disability and later terminated him because of that disability; and that UPS <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>discharged him in retaliation for bringing his discrimination claims. Cooper\u2019s race discrimination claims were brought pursuant to Title VII, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e <em>et seq., </em>and 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981; his disability discrimination claims were brought pursuant to the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12101 <em>et seq.; </em>and his retaliation claims were brought pursuant to Title VII.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b501-5\">On August 4, 2009, UPS moved for summary judgment. The district court granted the motion on August 19, 2009, concluding that Cooper\u2019s transfer to Harvey was not an adverse employment action, that Cooper made no prima facie case of a racially discriminatory discharge, that Cooper could not perform the \u201cessential functions\u201d of his job and thus was not discriminated against on the basis of his alleged disability, and that UPS did not discharge Cooper in retaliation for filing discrimination claims. The district court entered final judgment in favor of UPS on August 20, 2009. Cooper now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-6\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b501-7\">\n<em>A. Standard of Review</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b501-8\">\u201cWe review a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment <em>de novo, </em>applying the same standards as the district court.\u201d <em>Pegram v. Honeywell, Inc., </em>361 F.3d 272, 278 (5th Cir.2004). Summary judgment is appropriate where the record shows \u201cthat there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed. R.Civ.P. 56(c)(2); <em>accord Pegram, </em>361 F.3d at 278. \u201cA dispute about a material fact is genuine if the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the non-moving party.\u201d <em>Davis v. Dallas Area Rapid Transit, </em>383 F.3d 309, 316 (5th Cir.2004) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b501-11\">\n<em>B. Race Discrimination Claims</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b501-12\">The summary judgment test for race discrimination claims under \u00a7 1981 is the same as the test for race discrimination claims under Title VIL <em>Id. </em>Because Cooper does not allege any direct evidence of discrimination, we apply the familiar <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>burden-shifting analysis. <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, </em>411 U.S. 792, 802, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973)). \u201cTo survive summary judgment under <em>McDonnell Douglas, </em>the plaintiff must first present evidence of a prima facie ease of discrimination.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 317. If the plaintiff presents a prima facie case of discrimination, then an inference of discrimination arises, and the burden shifts to the employer to articulate a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for the underlying employment action. <em>Id. </em>\u201cIf the employer is able to state a legitimate rationale for its employment action, the inference of discrimination disappears and the plaintiff must present evidence that the employer\u2019s proffered reason was mere pretext for racial discrimination.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b501-13\">To establish a prima case of discrimination, Cooper must show that (1) he is a member of a protected class; (2) he is qualified for the position; (3) he suffered an adverse employment action; and (4) he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>was replaced by someone outside the protected class or was treated less favorably than other similarly situated employees outside the protected group. <em>See McCoy v. City of Shreveport, </em>492 F.3d 551, 556 (5th Cir.2007) (per curiam); <em>Bryan v. McKinsey &amp; Co., </em>375 F.3d 358, 360 (5th Cir.2004). However, the requirements for showing a prima facie case are somewhat flexible. <em>McDonnell Douglas, </em>411 U.S. at 802 n. 13, 93 S.Ct. 1817 (\u201cThe facts necessarily will vary in Title VII cases, and the specification above of the prima facie proof required ... is not necessarily applicable to every respect in differing factual situations.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b502-4\">Cooper argues that UPS unlawfully discriminated against him on the basis of race both by transferring him to Harvey and by eventually discharging him. UPS disputes that Cooper has established a prima facie case of racial discrimination on either claim. Specifically, as to Cooper\u2019s transfer to Harvey, UPS argues that the transfer was not an adverse employment action, and, as to Cooper\u2019s discharge, UPS argues both that Cooper failed to show that he was replaced by someone outside his protected class and that he generally failed to put forth any evidence of racial discrimination. We address each claim in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">\n<em>1. Cooper\u2019s Transfer to Harvey</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AVC\">Regarding Cooper\u2019s transfer to Harvey, Cooper asserts solely that the increased commuting time \u2014 -25 minutes each way\u2014 makes the transfer an adverse employment action. We disagree.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b502-6\">\u201c[A]n employment action that \u2018does not affect job duties, compensation, or benefits\u2019 is not an adverse employment action.\u201d <em>Pegram, </em>361 F.3d at 282 (quoting <em>Banks v. E. Baton Rouge Parish Sch. Bd., </em>320 F.3d 570, 575 (5th Cir.2003)). \u201c[A]n employment transfer may qualify as an \u2018adverse employment action if the change makes the job objectively worse.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 283 (quoting <em>Hunt v. Rapides Healthcare Sys., LLC., </em>277 F.3d 757, 770 (5th Cir.2001)). A purely lateral transfer is not an adverse employment action; however, a transfer that is the \u201cequivalent of a demotion\u201d is an adverse employment action. <em>Alvarado v. Tex. Rangers, </em>492 F.3d 605, 612 (5th Cir.2007). A transfer can be the equivalent of a demotion where the new position is \u201c \u2018objectively worse \u2014 such as being less prestigious or less interesting or providing less room for advancement.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 613 (quoting <em>Sharp v. City of Houston, </em>164 F.3d 923, 933 (5th Cir.1999)). \u201c[T]he focus is on the objective qualities of the positions, rather than an employee\u2019s subjective preference for one position over another. That subjective preference, alone, is an insufficient basis for finding an adverse employment action.\u201d <em>Hunt, </em>277 at 771 n. 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-9\">Cooper\u2019s transfer from New Orleans to Harvey was not an adverse employment action. Cooper had the same title and benefits in Harvey as he did in New Orleans. Though a longer commute may have been inconvenient for Cooper, we cannot say that the new position was objectively worse such that it was the equivalent of a demotion. <em>See Johnson v. TCB Constr. Co., </em>334 Fed.Appx. 666, 671 (5th Cir.2009) (per curiam) (\u201c[Although <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>the new job site was 30 or 35 minutes from [Plaintiff\u2019s] home, there is no evidence ... that [the Plaintiffs] new commute was unreasonable.\u201d (citing <em>Sanchez v. Denver Pub. Schs., </em>164 F.3d 527, 532 (10th Cir.1998) (commute time increase from 5-7 to 3(M0 minutes did not constitute an adverse employment action))); <em>Spring v. Sheboygan Area Sch. Dist., </em>865 F.2d 883, 886 (7th Cir.1989) (holding that change in employment assignment that, <em>inter alia, </em>increased on-the-job commuting time was not an adverse employment action); <em>see also Gray v. Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co., </em>131 F.Supp.2d 895, 904 (S.D.Tex.2001) (\u201c[A]n assignment to a position which has equal compensation, terms, conditions, and privileges of employment \u2014 but which requires a longer commute \u2014 does not constitute an adverse employment action.\u201d).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Because Cooper\u2019s transfer to Harvey was not an adverse employment action, we conclude that Cooper failed to establish a prima facie case of racial discrimination regarding his transfer to Harvey and thus summary judgment in favor of UPS on that claim was appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">\n<em>2. Cooper\u2019s Discharge</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AFV\">Cooper also asserts that UPS terminated him on the basis of his race. However, while Cooper alleged below that he was discharged on the basis of his race, he failed to mention race as a reason he was fired in a subsequent deposition and he failed to point to anyone outside his protected class that either replaced him or was treated more favorably. Though the requirements are flexible, Cooper\u2019s unsupported allegations of racial discrimination are insufficient to meet his burden of establishing a prima facie case of racially discriminatory discharge. <em>Cf. Little v. Liquid Air Corp., </em>37 F.3d 1069, 1075 (5th Cir.1994) (en banc; per curiam) (\u201cRule 56 <em>mandates </em>the entry of summary judgment ... against a party who fails to make a showing sufficient to establish the existence of an element essential to that party\u2019s case, and on which that party will bear the burden of proof at trial.... This burden is not satisfied with some metaphysical doubt as to the material facts, by concluso-ry allegations, by unsubstantiated assertions, or by only a scintilla of evidence^]\u201d (internal quotation marks and citations omitted)). Accordingly, summary judgment in favor of UPS on Cooper\u2019s racially discriminatory discharge claim was appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-9\">\n<em>C. ADA Claims</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b503-10\">Cooper also claims that UPS failed to reasonably accommodate his disability and discharged him because of his disability. UPS responds that Cooper is not disabled and that, even if Cooper was disabled, he is not a qualified individual with a disability. The district court concluded that Cooper did not show that he could perform the essential functions of his job and thus dismissed his ADA claims. We agree.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b504-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>The ADA provides that \u201c[n]o covered entity shall discriminate against a qualified individual with a disability because of the disability of such individual in regard to [the] ... advancement, [or] discharge of employees, ... and other terms conditions, and privileges of employment.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12112(a) (2005). \u201cTo prevail on an ADA claim, a plaintiff must prove that 1) he has a \u2018disability; 2) he is \u2018qualified\u2019 for the job; and 3) an adverse employment decision was made solely because of his disability.\u201d <em>Turco v. Hoechst Celanese Corp., </em>101 F.3d 1090, 1092 (5th Cir.1997) (per curiam). Relevant here, a \u201cdisability\u201d is \u201cany physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more of [the plaintiffs] major life activities.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12102(2)(A) (2005). Major life activities include \u201cworking.\u201d 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1630.2(f). A plaintiff is \u201csubstantially limited\u201d in working when he is</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-4\">significantly restricted in the ability to perform either a class of jobs or a broad range of jobs in various classes as compared to the average person having comparable training, skills and abilities. The inability to perform a single, particular job does not constitute a substantial limitation in the major life activity of working.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b504-5\"><em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1630.2(j)(3)(i).</p>\n<p id=\"b504-6\">However, even assuming that one has a disability, to be a qualified individual with a disability the plaintiff must be \u201can individual with a disability who, with or without reasonable accommodation, can perform the essential functions of the employment position that such individual holds or desires.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12111(8) (2005). Relevant here, reasonable accommodations include \u201cQ]ob restructuring; part-time or modified work schedules; [or] reassignment to a vacant position.\u201d 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1630.2(0 )(2)(ii). However, \u201c[t]he ADA does not require an employer to relieve an employee of any essential function of his or her job, modify those duties, reassign existing employees to perform those jobs, or hire new employees to do so.\u201d <em>Burch v. City of Nacogdoches, </em>174 F.3d 615, 621 (5th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b504-9\">Here, it is undisputed that the essential functions of Cooper\u2019s job include meeting Department of Transportation (DOT) requirements for drivers and working in an environment with variable temperatures and humidity. Cooper does not present any evidence suggesting that he could perform these functions with or without accommodations. Indeed, Cooper\u2019s own medical experts, Dr. Levy and Gooch, indicated that Cooper should not work in a variable temperature environment and could not meet DOT requirements. Further, both experts stated that no corrective devices or medications would aid Cooper\u2019s condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-10\">Thus, assuming <em>arguendo </em>that Cooper has a \u201cdisability,\u201d Cooper is not a \u201cqualified individual with a disability\u201d because he cannot perform the essential functions of his job. <em>Cf. Burch, </em>174 F.3d at 621 (firefighter who could not fight fires could not perform essential functions of firefighting job and thus could not be reasonably accommodated as a firefighter as a matter of law); <em>Guerrea v. United Parcel Service, Inc., </em>250 F.3d 739, 2001 WL 274296 at *2-3 (5th Cir.2001) (unpublished table opinion) (employee who could not lift packages of certain weight could not perform essential functions of warehouse job and could not be reasonably accommodated; thus, employee failed to establish a prima facie case of disability discrimination).</p>\n<p id=\"b505-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>However, Cooper argues that UPS could have reassigned him to a position in plant engineering, a position that he claims would have accommodated his disability. \u201cWhen no reasonable accommodation can be made to the plaintiffs prior job, he may be transferred to another position.\u201d <em>Jenkins v. Cleco Power, LLC, </em>487 F.3d 309, 315 (5th Cir.2007). \u201cFor the accommodation of a reassignment to be reasonable, it is clear that a position must first exist and be vacant. Under the ADA, an employer is not required to give what it does not have.\u201d <em>Foreman v. Babcock &amp; Wilcox Co., </em>117 F.3d 800, 810 (5th Cir.1997). \u201cThe plaintiff bears the burden of proving that an available position exists that he was qualified for and could, with reasonable accommodations, perform.\u201d <em>Jenkins, </em>487 F.3d at 315.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">Here, Cooper fails to assert that there are any vacancies in plant engineering, that he was qualified for such a job, or that he even formally applied for such a job. While the record indicates that Cooper did inquire about a plant engineering job, Cooper does not show that such a position was vacant or that he was qualified for that job. \u201c[T]he law requires [a plaintiff] also to prove that he is qualified for [an alternative] position. Part of that proof must be more than the worker\u2019s self-serving testimony that he could have performed [the job].\u201d <em>Burch, </em>174 F.3d at 622. Cooper\u2019s desire for a job in plant engineering, without accompanying evidence demonstrating his qualifications for that job, is insufficient to sustain his claim that such a job would be a reasonable accommodation. Accordingly, summary judgment in favor of UPS on Cooper\u2019s ADA claims was appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-6\">\n<em>D. Retaliatory Discharge Claims</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b505-7\">Cooper also alleges that UPS unlawfully retaliated against him by discharging him in response to his claims of discrimination. \u201c[T]he <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>test ... is also applicable to Title VII unlawful retaliation cases.\u201d <em>Byers v. Dallas Morning News, Inc., </em>209 F.3d 419, 427 (5th Cir.2000). Thus, Cooper must first establish a prima facie case of retaliation before the burden of production shifts to UPS to proffer a legitimate, non-retaliatory reason for the adverse employment action. Finally, the burden falls on Cooper to show why UPS\u2019s proffered explanation is pretext for unlawful retaliation.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-9\">To establish a prima facie case of unlawful retaliation under Title VII, Cooper must show (1) that he engaged in an activity protected by Title VII, (2) that an adverse employment action occurred, and (3) that a causal link existed between the protected activity and the adverse employment action. <em>Long v. Eastfield Coll., </em>88 F.3d 300, 304 (5th Cir.1996). \u201cClose timing between an employee\u2019s protected activity and an adverse action against him may provide the \u2018causal connection\u2019 required to make out a prima facie case of retaliation.\u201d <em>McCoy, </em>492 F.3d at 562 (5th Cir.2007) (footnotes and internal quotation marks omitted). \u201cHowever, once the employer offers a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason that explains both the adverse action and the timing, the plaintiff must offer some evidence from which the jury may infer that retaliation was the real motive.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b505-10\">Here, assuming <em>arguendo </em>that Cooper has established a prima facie case of retaliatory discharge, Cooper has not met his burden of showing why UPS\u2019s proffered explanation \u2014 that he was fired after being absent from work for over a year, per the terms of the Income Protection Plan \u2014 is pretextual. UPS twice notified Cooper that the Income Protection Plan provides for administrative separation after an employee is absent for over twelve months and requested that Cooper either return to work or provide additional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>information; Cooper neither returned to work nor provided additional information. Finally, after nearly two years of absence from employment, UPS notified Cooper of his administrative separation.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-4\">Cooper neither disputes that the terms of the Plan provide for his separation nor argues that UPS invidiously enforces the terms of the Plan. Instead, Cooper asserts that the real reason for his termination was UPS\u2019s failure to reasonably accommodate his disability. \u201cWhether summary judgment is appropriate ... depends on numerous factors, including the strength of the employee\u2019s prima facie case, the probative value of the proof that the employer\u2019s explanation is false, and any other evidence that supports the employer\u2019s case and that properly may be considered.\u201d <em>Price v. Fed. Express Corp., </em>283 F.3d 715, 720 (5th Cir.2002). We conclude that Cooper has not produced sufficient evidence from which a reasonable factfinder could infer that Cooper was discharged as retaliation for filing claims of discrimination. Accordingly, summary judgment in favor of UPS on Cooper\u2019s retaliatory discharge claims is appropriate. <em>Cf. McCoy, </em>492 F.3d at 562 (holding that summary judgment was appropriate where plaintiff \u201cattempt[ed] to prove pretext simply by showing that the [defendant] knew of her complaints and took an adverse employment action shortly thereafter\u201d and did not offer reasons as to why the legitimate reasons proffered for her discharge were pre-textual).</p>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b506-6\">For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b499-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b500-6\">. Cooper also claims to have submitted an evaluation from Dr. Ferrara stating substantially the same information.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b501-9\">. Cooper also initially brought claims against both UPS and the UPS Flexible Benefits Plan pursuant to ERISA, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001 <em>et seq., </em>and COBRA, 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 2590. Cooper voluntarily dismissed his ERISA and COBRA claims brought against UPS and also voluntarily dismissed all claims brought against the UPS Flexible Benefits Plan on August 14, 2008. Cooper added \u00a7 1981 race discrimination claims against UPS in a second amended complaint filed in March 2009. Cooper then filed a second action which more fully alleged race and disability discrimination claims against UPS and the UPS Flexible Benefits Plan in May 2009. These claims against the UPS Flexible Benefits Plan were voluntarily dismissed on June 20, 2009. Both actions were consolidated on June 24, 2009.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b502-7\">. The district court dismissed Cooper's Title VII race discrimination claims concerning his transfer to Harvey as barred because Cooper\u2019s EEOC charge addressing those claims was untimely filed. The district court did analyze Cooper\u2019s adverse employment action claims under \u00a7 1981, noting that the Title VII framework was equivalent. Cooper does not challenge the dismissal of his Title VII race discrimination claims concerning his transfer to Harvey, and accordingly, we do not review the district court's dismissal of those claims. However, we do evaluate, as the district court did, Cooper\u2019s \u00a7 1981 claims concerning his transfer to Harvey.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b503-6\">. <em>Cf. Keeton v. Flying J, Inc., </em>429 F.3d 259, 265 n. 2 (6th Cir.2005) (holding that where an employee was transferred to a new job site over 120 miles away, that transfer, while not <em>per se </em>an adverse employment action, was an appropriate factor for the jury to consider in determining whether an adverse employment action occurred); <em>Policastro v. Nw.
