The BIA found that Ortiz was ineligible for relief because his testimony was not credible. On appeal, Ortiz argues that the BIA\u2019s adverse credibility finding was erroneous and the BIA unreasonably expected him to provide corroborating evidence in addition to his testimony. After thorough review, we deny the petition.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1022-10\">When the BIA does not adopt the IJ\u2019s decision, we review only the BIA\u2019s decision. <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir.2001). Credibility determinations are reviewed under the substantial-evidence test. <em>Forgue v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1282, 1286 (11th Cir.2005). Under the substantial-evidence test, we must affirm the BIA\u2019s decision if it is \u201csupported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1284 (quotation omitted). Therefore, we will reverse a finding of fact \u201conly when the record compels a reversal; the mere fact that the record may support a contrary conclusion is not enough to justify a reversal.\u201d <em>Adejemi v. Ashcroft, </em>386 F.3d 1022, 1027 (11th Cir.2004) <em>(en </em>banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-16\">To be eligible for asylum \u201cthe [applicant] must, with credible evidence, establish (1) past persecution on account of [his] political opinion or any other protected ground, or (2) a \u2018well-founded fear\u2019 that [his] political opinion or any other protected ground will cause future persecution.\u201d <em>Sepulveda, </em>401 F.3d at 1230-31 (quoting 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(a), (b)). To qualify for withholding of removal, an applicant must establish that it is more likely than not \u201cthat his life or freedom would be threatened on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\u201d <em>Mendoza v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>327 F.3d 1283, 1287 (11th Cir.2003) (citing 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3)(A)). The applicant bears the burden of proof in establishing his eligibility for asylum and withholding of removal. <em>See id.; </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(l)(B)(i). While the burdens of proof for asylum and withholding of removal are different, if an applicant cannot establish that he has a well-founded fear of future persecution based on a protected ground if he were to be returned to his country, he cannot qualify for either asy<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"995\">*995</page-number>lum or \"withholding of removal. <em>See Se-pulveda, </em>401 F.3d at 1232-33.</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-5\">An applicant\u2019s testimony, if credible, may carry his burden of proof without corroboration. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(a). \u201cConversely, an adverse credibility determination alone may be sufficient to support the denial of an asylum application.\u201d <em>Forgue, </em>401 F.3d at 1287. The BIA must make a \u201cclean\u201d determination of credibility. <em>Yang v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>418 F.3d 1198, 1201 (11th Cir.2005). The BIA must also \u201coffer specific, cogent reasons for an adverse credibility finding.\u201d <em>Forgue, </em>401 F.3d at 1287. \u201cOnce an adverse credibility finding is made, the burden is on the applicant alien to show that the [BIA\u2019s] credibility decision was not supported by \u2018specific, cogent reasons\u2019 or was not based on substantial evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cIndications of reliable testimony include consistency on direct examination, consistency with the written application, and the absence of embellishments.\u201d <em>Ruiz v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>440 F.3d 1247, 1255 (11th Cir.2006). We \u201cmay not substitute [our] judgment for that of the [BIA] with respect to credibility findings.\u201d <em>Forgue, </em>401 F.3d at 1286 (quotation omitted). In addition, if an applicant who is not a credible witness produces other evidence of persecution aside from his testimony, the BIA is obligated to consider that evidence. <em>Id. </em>at 1287.</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-6\">The REAL ID Act amended the INA\u2019s asylum provisions in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(l)(B)(iii) to provide that an adverse-credibility determination can be based on inconsistencies, inaccuracies, or falsehoods, regardless of whether they relate to the heart of an applicant\u2019s claim. Pub.L. No. 109-13, \u00a7 101(a)(3), (d), 119 Stat. 231, 303-05 (2005). Because Ortiz filed his asylum application in 2006, after the May 2005 effective date of the REAL ID Act, this provision applies to his claim. See Pub.L. No. 109-13, \u00a7 101(h)(2), 119 Stat. 231, 305.</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-7\">Here, the BIA\u2019s adverse credibility determination was supported by substantial evidence. There were two major discrepancies in Ortiz\u2019s evidence concerning: (1) his imprisonment in a cage on November 7, 2004; and (2) why he left the other captives behind when he escaped from imprisonment. These discrepancies are especially significant given that they both related to the only incident in which Ortiz alleged that he suffered actual physical persecution. Thus, because there were two major discrepancies in Ortiz\u2019s testimony, the record does not compel a reversal of the BIA\u2019s adverse credibility decision. Furthermore, the remaining evidence in this case does not compel a finding that Ortiz satisfied his burden of proof with regard to asylum and withholding of removal, and accordingly, we deny Ortiz\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-8\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1022-11\">. Because Ortiz\u2019s counseled brief does not set forth an argument regarding CAT relief, he has abandoned the CAT issue on appeal. <em>See Sepulveda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1228 n. 2 (11th Cir.2005) (holding that a party abandons claims that he does not argue in his brief).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
