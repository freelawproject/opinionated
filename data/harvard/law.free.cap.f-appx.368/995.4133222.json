On appeal, Chen argues that the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination was not supported by specific, cogent reasons, and that the inconsistencies on record stemmed from translation errors caused by his counsel below, for which he should not be held responsible. After thorough review, we deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-14\">When the BIA issues a decision, we review only that decision, except to the extent that the BIA expressly adopts the IJ\u2019s decision. <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir.2001). To the extent that the BIA adopts the IJ\u2019s reasoning, we review the IJ\u2019s decision as well. <em>Id. </em>In this case, the BIA issued a written opinion, and, although it agreed with the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding and ultimate conclusion, it did not expressly adopt the rest of the IJ\u2019s opinion in the analysis. Accordingly, we review both the IJ\u2019s and BIA\u2019s opinions regarding the adverse credibility determination, but not the underlying merits of Chen\u2019s claims because the BIA did not adopt that part of the IJ\u2019s opinion. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1024-15\">We review factual findings and credibility determinations under the substantial evidence test. <em>Forgue v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1282, 1286 (11th Cir.2005). Under the substantial evidence test, we must affirm the IJ\u2019s and BIA\u2019s decisions if they are \u201csupported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1284 (quotation omitted). \u201cTo reverse a factual finding ..., [we] must find not only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"997\">*997</page-number>that the evidence supports a contrary conclusion, but that it compels one.\u201d <em>Farquharson v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>246 F.3d 1317, 1320 (11th Cir.2001). The fact that evidence in the record may also support a conclusion contrary to the administrative findings is not enough to justify a reversal. <em>Adefemi v. Ashcroft, </em>386 F.3d 1022, 1027 (11th Cir.2004) <em>{en </em>banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-5\">An alien who arrives in or is present in the United States may apply for asylum. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(1). The Attorney General or Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security has discretion to grant asylum if the alien meets the INA\u2019s definition of a \u201crefugee.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(1). A \u201crefugee\u201d is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1025-6\">any person who is outside any country of such person\u2019s nationality or, in the ease of a person having no nationality, is outside any country in which such person last habitually resided, and who is unable or unwilling to return to, and is unable or unwilling to avail himself or herself of the protection of, that country because of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion];.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1025-7\">8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A). The asylum applicant carries the burden of proving statutory \u201crefugee\u201d status. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(a); <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1284. To establish eligibility, the alien must establish, with specific and credible evidence, (1) past persecution on account of a statutorily listed factor, or (2) a well-founded fear that the statutorily listed factor will cause future persecution. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(a) and (b); <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1287.</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-8\">Regarding withholding of removal, an alien may qualify by showing \u201cit is more likely than not that [the petitioner\u2019s] life or freedom would be threatened on account of a statutorily protected factor if returned to [the country of removal].\u201d <em>Silva v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>448 F.3d 1229, 1243 (11th Cir.2006). This standard is more stringent than the standard for asylum. <em>Sepulveda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1232 (11th Cir.2005). Accordingly, an alien who fails to establish eligibility for asylum generally cannot satisfy the higher burden for withholding of removal. <em>Id. </em>at 1232-33.</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-10\">To qualify for CAT relief, an applicant must also meet standards more stringent than those for asylum eligibility. <em>Rodriguez Morales v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>488 F.3d 884, 891 (11th Cir.2007). The applicant carries the burden of proof to establish \u201c \u2018that it is more likely than not that he or she would be tortured if removed to the proposed country of removal.\u2019 \u201d <em>Sanchez Jimenez v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>492 F.3d 1223, 1239 (11th Cir.2007) (quoting 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(c)(2)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-11\">Like any finding of fact, a credibility determination may not be overturned unless the record compels it. <em>Forgue, </em>401 F.3d at 1287. \u201cIndications of reliable testimony include consistency on direct examination, consistency with the written application, and the absence of embellishments.\u201d <em>Ruiz v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>440 F.3d 1247, 1255 (11th Cir.2006). If the IJ and the BIA explicitly determine that the alien is not credible, they must give specific, cogent reasons for the adverse credibility determination. <em>Chen v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>463 F.3d 1228, 1231 (11th Cir.2006). \u201cThe burden then shifts to the alien to show that the IJ\u2019s credibility determination was not supported by specific, cogent reasons or was not based on substantial evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted). The IJ and the BIA may deny asylum based solely on an adverse credibility determination, especially when the alien does not produce corroborating evidence. <em>Id. </em>However, if an applicant produces evidence other than his testimony, \u201cit is not sufficient for the IJ to rely solely on an adverse credibility deter-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"998\">*998</page-number>initiation in those instances.\u201d <em>Forgue, </em>401 F.3d at 1287. \u201cThe weaker an applicant\u2019s testimony, however, the greater the need for corroborative evidence.\u201d <em>Yang v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>418 F.3d 1198, 1201 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b1026-4\">Here, in denying Chen\u2019s application, the IJ made an explicit adverse credibility determination' \u2014 with which the BIA agreed\u2014 and offered specific, cogent reasons for the determination. <em>See Chen, </em>463 F.3d at 1231. As the record shows, the IJ found and discussed in detail several specific instances of inconsistencies between Chen\u2019s argument and the record. The inconsistencies involved: (1) the method of payment to the snakehead who smuggled Chen into the United States; (2) Chen\u2019s actual place of residence in the United States; (3) Chen\u2019s identity because he failed to comply with fingerprint requirements; (4) the exact year when Chen allowed his friends to practice Falun Gong in the old house; (5) the arrest notice showing the name \u201cZhen Wu\u201d; and (6) the medical condition which prompted Chen to start practicing Falun Gong. Because the IJ and the BIA provided specific, cogent reasons for their credibility determinations, the burden shifted to Chen to show that the decision was unsupported by such reasons or was not based on substantial evidence. <em>See Chen, </em>463 F.3d at 1232.</p>\n<p id=\"b1026-5\">Chen\u2019s assertions on appeal fail to satisfy this burden. First, as noted, the record contains numerous material inconsistencies, and, thus, does not support Chen\u2019s contention that he had testified consistently and credibly. Second, Chen cannot rely on alleged translation errors by his attorney below to explain the inconsistencies involving the Chinese notice of appeal and the letter from his mother. Indeed, since attorney statements are not considered to be evidence, the record here does not support Chen\u2019s claims regarding the allegedly erroneous translations. <em>See Matter of Ramirez-Sanchez, </em>17 I. &amp; N. Dec. 503, 506 (BIA 1980) (holding that an attorney\u2019s arguments are not evidence). Further, Chen\u2019s related argument \u2014 that he should not be held responsible for his attorney\u2019s errors below \u2014 is without merit because a litigant is generally bound by all acts and omissions of his attorney. <em>See Link v. Wabash R.R. Co., </em>370 U.S. 626, 633-34, 82 S.Ct. 1386, 8 L.Ed.2d 734 (1962) (holding that in the context of a negligence action, a party cannot avoid the consequences of the acts or omissions of his freely selected attorney). Finally, because the IJ had already found Chen\u2019s corroborating evidence to be unconvincing based on the material inconsistencies between his testimony and evidentiary submissions, the IJ\u2019s and BIA\u2019s adverse credibility determination alone was sufficient to support the denial of asylum and withholding of removal. <em>See Forgue, </em>401 F.3d at 1287.</p>\n<p id=\"b1026-8\">In sum, substantial evidence from the record as a whole supports the IJ\u2019s and BIA\u2019s adverse credibility determination and does not compel us to draw a different conclusion regarding Chen\u2019s asylum and withholding of removal claims. <em>See Farquharson, </em>246 F.3d at 1320. We therefore deny the petition for review.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1026-9\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1026-6\">. We also deny Chen's petition for review regarding the CAT claim because he fails to offer an argument challenging the BIA's finding that he had waived the CAT claim below. <em>See Sepulveda, </em>401 F.3d at 1228 n. 2 (holding that an issue is abandoned if the petitioner fails to proffer argument on its merits on appeal).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
