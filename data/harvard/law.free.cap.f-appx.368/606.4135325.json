The district court dismissed the case as frivolous and awarded attorney\u2019s fees to the state official. Pe-ch\u00f3n filed a motion for relief from the judgment \u2014 which the court denied. Pe-ch\u00f3n appeals, and we affirm in part and dismiss in part for lack of appellate jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-8\">Pech\u00f3n alleges that her boss fired her for being too old. She sued her former employer \u2014 the Louisiana Department of Health and Hospitals \u2014 and its Secretary\u2014 Alan Levine \u2014 in federal district court. Pe-ch\u00f3n sought money damages from all defendants, including from Levine in both his official and personal capacities. She asserted causes of action under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, and the Age Discrimination in Employment Act.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b636-13\">The defendants filed a motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction and for failure to state a claim, which the court, through a magistrate judge,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> granted. It found that the Eleventh Amendment shielded from suit in federal court the Department<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and Levine in his official capacity. Because Pech\u00f3n did not allege any facts to show that Levine personally had wronged her, the court dismissed the \u00a7 1983 action against him for failure to state a claim. Finally, the court dismissed the age discrimination claim because the Act requires plaintiffs first to exhaust administrative remedies, which Pech\u00f3n concedes she did not do. For having to defend against Pe-chon\u2019s frivolous lawsuit, each defendant requested \u2014 and the court granted \u2014 attorney\u2019s fees under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-14\">Pech\u00f3n filed motions under Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 59(a)(1)(B), 59(e), and 60(b)(6) \u2014 seeking a new trial, an alteration to the judgment, or relief from the operation of the judgment. As Pech\u00f3n did not establish a manifest error of law or other extraordinary circumstances to justify disturbing the earlier order, the court denied her motions. The court did, howev<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>er, move sua sponte to clarify its previous order, explaining that only Levine in his personal capacity \u2014 not the other defendants \u2014 would receive attorney\u2019s fees under \u00a7 1988. The court left for future decision the amount of those fees and instructed Levine to submit a detailed calculation of his legal expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-5\">Pech\u00f3n filed a notice of appeal, in which she challenges three of the magistrate judge\u2019s decisions: 1) the dismissal of her claims;<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> 2) the denial of relief from that judgment; and 3) the imposition of attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-7\">We must pause to verify our jurisdiction. Pech\u00f3n urges that we have it under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, which vests the circuit courts with authority to hear \u201cappeals from all final decisions of the district courts of the United States.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b637-12\">\u201cIn most cases, an order is final only when it ends the litigation on the merits and leaves nothing for the court to do but execute the judgment.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Here, the dismissal of Pechon\u2019s claims and the denial of post-judgment relief are final. Nothing left to do but execute the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-13\">The imposition of attorney\u2019s fees is another story. Indeed, a claim for attorney\u2019s fees is seen as a separate action from one on the merits,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and we have held that an order imposing attorney\u2019s fees that leaves \u201cfor a later determination the amount\u201d is not a \u201c \u2018final order\u2019 for pur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>poses of appellate review.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In this case, the district court expressly set for future decision the amount of the attorney\u2019s fees.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We DISMISS for lack of jurisdiction the portion of Pechon\u2019s appeal challenging the imposition of attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">We review de novo the district court\u2019s dismissal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and for failure to state a claim.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Pech\u00f3n has given up trying to sue either the Department or the Secretary\u2014 each an arm of the state of Louisiana \u2014 -for money damages. She maintains, however, that Levine is vulnerable to a suit for money damages in his personal capacity. No doubt, but to recover under \u00a7 1983 Pech\u00f3n has to prove that Levine was either \u201cpersonally involved in the constitutional violation\u201d or \u201ccausally connected to the constitutional violation alleged.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> To do this, she might show that Levine has implemented \u201ca policy so deficient that the policy itself is a repudiation of constitutional rights and is the moving force of the constitutional violation.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Pech\u00f3n has not so alleged \u2014 and certainly has not presented enough to \u201craise [her] right to relief above the speculative level.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b639-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number> That leaves only Pechon\u2019s federal age discrimination claim. She admits that she cannot recover directly under the Act, because she did not exhaust administrative remedies.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Instead, she tries to shoehorn her age discrimination claim into a \u00a7 1983 cause of action \u2014 based on a violation of equal protection for the elderly. But we have held that \u201c\u00a7 1983 age discrimination claim[s] [are] preempted by the ADEA.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> We hold that the magistrate judge rightly dismissed each of Pechon\u2019s claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-5\">In her motions for relief from judgment, Pech\u00f3n tried to relitigate her dismissed causes of action. Because the magistrate judge correctly dismissed the claims in the first instance, it necessarily follows that the magistrate judge did not abuse her discretion<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> in denying relief from the judgment. The district court did not err in dismissing Pechon\u2019s case, so we AFFIRM both the dismissal and the denial of motions seeking a new trial, an alteration to the judgment, and relief from the operation of the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-10\">AFFIRMED IN PART; APPEAL DISMISSED IN PART FOR LACK OF JURISDICTION.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b636-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.

The notice of appeal expressly challenges only the denial of Pechon's Rules 59 and 60 motions and the imposition of attorney's fees.

R.App. P. 3(c)(1)(B). While Pech\u00f3n \"has breached the formal requirements of Rule 3(c), this error does not defeat [her] right to appeal the entire case.
