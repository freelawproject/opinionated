He appeals the denial of a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 petition asserting that the District of Colorado was without jurisdiction to convict him, that he is actually innocent, and that he has been the victim of corruption in the judicial system. Powell previously has filed two motions under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 and one \u00a7 2241 petition in the District of Colorado, along with a \u00a7 2241 petition in the Eastern District of Virginia.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-25\">The district court correctly determined that Powell\u2019s claims are not cognizable in a \u00a7 2241 petition. Powell may challenge his conviction under \u00a7 2241 only if he establishes that \u201cthe remedy [under \u00a7 2255] is inadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention.\u201d \u00a7 2255(e); <em>see Jeffers v. Chandler, </em>253 F.3d 827, 830 (5th Cir.2001) (citing <em>Reyes-Requena v. United States, </em>243 F.3d 893, 904 (5th Cir.2001)). Powell does not rely upon a retroactively applicable Supreme Court decision that establishes that he is actually innocent. Thus, he fails to demonstrate that the remedy under \u00a7 2255 is inadequate. <em>See Jeffers, </em>253 F.3d at 830-31.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-26\">We caution Powell that any future frivolous, repetitive, or otherwise abusive filings may result in the imposition of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>sanctions, including dismissal, monetary sanctions, and restrictions on his ability to file pleadings in this court or any court subject to this court\u2019s jurisdiction. The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED, Powell\u2019s motion to expedite the appeal is DENIED, and a SANCTION WARNING IS ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b537-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
