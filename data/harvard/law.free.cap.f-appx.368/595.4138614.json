Because the United States does not own or claim any interest in the property, we lack subject matter jurisdiction to resolve the dispute. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2409a, 2410.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-18\">For purposes of this appeal, the facts are not in dispute. The property was initially owned by Arbra and Patsy Echols. In 1993, they executed a deed of trust for the benefit of Arbra\u2019s brother, Carlton Echols, and Carlton\u2019s wife, Irene Echols, to the predecessor of the Farm Services Agency (\u201cFSA\u201d). The deed of trust offered the property as collateral to secure two notes for Carlton. Because of death and illness, the secured notes fell into default. At the direction of the FSA, Arbra and Irene entered voluntary liquidation in 1996. Appellants assert that Arbra and Irene sold the property to them on April 26, 1996. They also assert that they settled the FSA\u2019s lien and properly recorded title. Appellants thereafter acted in all respects as owners of the property with good title.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-19\">On March 6, 2007, the FSA foreclosed on the property and sold it to Gulledge and Sons, LLC (\u201cGulledge\u201d) via warranty deed. Appellants learned of the sale in August 2007 when Trey Gulledge visited the land. Until that time, Appellants believed that the FSA had no interest in the property and were unaware of any actions by FSA to sell the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-20\">On January 20, 2009, Appellants filed a quiet title action in United States District Court for the Western District of Texas under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2409a to \u201cdeclare that the title claims of defendant United States to such real property are of no validity whatsoever\u201d (Case No. 09-cv-00012). On January 22, 2009, Appellants filed an action in the 77th District Court of Limestone County, Texas, to set aside the sale and cancel the trustee\u2019s deed under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2410. The state court action was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>removed to the United States District Court for the Western District of Texas by the government on February 10, 2009 (Case No. 09-cv-00033). In support of both claims, Appellants alleged that the Farm Service Agency had waived its lien in 1996, voided the deed of trust by refusal of payment, and then seized and \u201cconveyed\u201d the property to a foreclosure purchaser at public auction on March 6, 2007, despite knowledge of Appellants\u2019 purchase and warranty deed.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-5\">In separate rulings, the district court dismissed the claims for lack of subject matter jurisdiction under \u00a7\u00a7 2409a and 2410. Appellants appealed both rulings, and this court consolidated the two cases on September 8, 2009.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-6\">This court reviews questions of subject matter jurisdiction <em>de novo. Hussain v. Boston Old Colony, Ins. Co., </em>311 F.3d 623, 628 (5th Cir.2002). A party suing the United States must allege both a basis for the court\u2019s jurisdiction, Fed.R.Civ.P. 8(a)(1), and a specific statute containing a waiver of the United States\u2019s sovereign immunity from suit. <em>Lundeen v. Mineta, </em>291 F.3d 300, 304 (5th Cir.2002). Sovereign immunity is waived only by explicit, unequivocal statutory language, which is strictly construed, in terms of its scope, in favor of the sovereign. <em>Lane v. Pena, </em>518 U.S. 187, 192, 116 S.Ct. 2092, 135 L.Ed.2d 486 (1996). Absent a waiver of sovereign immunity, the federal government is immune from suit. <em>Loeffler v. Frank, </em>486 U.S. 549, 554, 108 S.Ct. 1965, 100 L.Ed.2d 549 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b625-10\">Appellants cite two statutes that waive sovereign immunity: 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2409a and 2410. Both waive sovereign immunity in cases involving real property disputes like the one at bar. Section 2409a subjects the United States to suit where \u201cthe United States claims an interest, other than a security interest or water rights,\u201d in real property. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2409a(a). Section 2410 subjects the United States to suit where \u201cthe United States has or claims a mortgage or other lien.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2410(a). Neither provision is applicable here, because the United States does not own or claim an interest in the disputed real property.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-11\">First, Appellants did not challenge the disclaimer or the court\u2019s order in the suit premised on \u00a7 2409a.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The district court properly dismissed this suit for lack of jurisdiction. <em>See Leisnoi, Inc. v. United States, </em>313 F.3d 1181, 1184 (9th Cir.2002) (\u201cOnce the United States filed its disclaimer of the land ... the plain terms of \u00a7 2409a(e) deprived the district court of jurisdiction.\u201d).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b625-12\">Second, Appellants claim that the government waived its sovereign immunity under \u00a7 2410. They assert that because of defects in the foreclosure, the government still retains a lien, and therefore, \u00a7 2410 waives sovereign immunity. Alternatively, Appellants contend that even if the government does not have a lien, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>\u00a7 2410 still waives sovereign immunity when the government failed to follow proper procedures. <em>See Popp v. Eberlein, </em>409 F.2d 309 (7th Cir.1969) (court retained jurisdiction under \u00a7 2410 to resolve dispute about whether a public sale was corrupt); <em>Aqua Bar &amp; Lounge, Inc. v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Treasury, </em>539 F.2d 935 (3d Cir.1976) (the court retained jurisdiction under \u00a7 2410 to determine whether a tax lien was properly imposed).</p>\n<p id=\"b626-4\">Under \u00a7 2410, the United States waives its sovereign immunity in a real property dispute where \u201cthe United States has or claims to have a mortgage or other lien.\u201d A party can raise a claim \u201conly if, at the time the \u00a7 2410(a) action is commenced, the government still claims a lien or a mortgage on the property.\u201d <em>Koehler v. United States, </em>153 F.3d 263, 266 (5th Cir.1998) (internal quotations and citations omitted). \u201cIf the government has sold the property prior to the filing of the \u00a7 2410(a) suit, \u00a7 2410(a) does not apply.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotations and citations omitted). The cases cited by Appellants are not controlling as this court has held that it may not review the validity of a foreclosure sale for procedural errors because such review would be ruling on the merits of the case. <em>Id. </em>at 267. In <em>Koehler, </em>the plaintiffs challenged the validity of a quitclaim deed because the IRS failed to provide the plaintiffs with proper notice of a foreclosure as required by IRS regulations. <em>Id. </em>at 265. The plaintiff claimed that the quitclaim title was ineffective and, therefore, the government still had a lien. The <em>Koehler </em>court rejected this reasoning, holding:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-5\">At its core, sovereign immunity deprives the courts of jurisdiction irrespective of the merits of the underlying claim. If the specific terms of the statute are not met, the federal courts have no jurisdiction to address the merits of the plaintiffs claim. Were we to accept taxpayer\u2019s argument, we would first have to find for her on the merits and then reason backwards to find a waiver of sovereign immunity. Because sovereign immunity is jurisdictional and, therefore, deprives this court of the ability to hear the merits of the claim altogether, such reasoning is inherently flawed. <em>In the end, because the plain and unambiguous terms of \u00a7 2110(a) have not been met </em>\u2014 ie., <em>the government no longer claims an interest in the </em>property\u2014 <em>\u00a7 2110(a) does not confer subject matter jurisdiction irrespective of how meritorious taxpayer\u2019s claims may be.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b626-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 267 (emphasis added). Accordingly, even procedurally defective sales prevent waiver of sovereign immunity under \u00a7 2410.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-8\">The foreclosure sale extinguished the United States\u2019s lienholder interest in the property. <em>See Conseco Fin. Servicing Corp. v. J &amp; J Mobile Homes, Inc., </em>120 S.W.3d 878, 883 (Tex.App.Fort Worth, 2003) (\u201cin foreclosure prior lienholders are divested of title to the property, and their liens are extinguished\u201d). Per <em>Koehler, </em>because the foreclosure sale took place before trial, sovereign immunity is not waived. Appellants are free to raise these procedural defects in the foreclosure in a quiet title suit against Gulledge, but they cannot do so against the government.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-9\">Finally, Appellants assert that <em>Koehler </em>is inapplicable because it involved a quitclaim deed and this case involves a general warranty deed. Appellants are correct on the facts, but wrong on the law. While <em>Koehler </em>did involve a quitclaim deed, its legal holding was broader. <em>Koehler </em>prevents this court from reviewing a case under \u00a7 2410 if the disputed property is sold, even if the sale is procedurally flawed. <em>Koehler, </em>153 F.3d at 267. Determining whether the foreclosure sale was invalid would require a resolution on the merits which sovereign immunity prevents.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>For the foregoing reasons, the district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b624-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b625-7\">. Section 2409a(e) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-8\">If the United States disclaims all interest in the real property or interest therein adverse to the plaintiff at any time prior to the actual commencement of the trial, which disclaimer is confirmed by order of the court, the jurisdiction of the district court shall cease unless it has jurisdiction of the civil action or suit on ground other than and independent of the authority conferred by section 1346(f) of this tide.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b625-13\">. Appellants assert, for the first time on appeal, that the government does have an interest in the property despite the disclaimer. The Appellants cannot attack the disclaimer for the first time in this court after failing to raise it at the district court level. <em>Stewart Glass &amp; Mirror, Inc. v. U.S. Auto Glass Disc. Ctr., Inc., </em>200 F.3d 307, 316-17 (5th Cir.2000) (\"It is a bedrock principle of appellate review that claims raised for the first time on appeal will not be considered.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
