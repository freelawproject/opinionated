Holt, </em>417 F.3d 1172, 1174 (11th Cir.2005). <em>\u201cAudita querela, </em>Latin for \u2018the complaint having been heard,\u2019 was an ancient writ used to attack the enforcement of a judgment after it was rendered.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted). It is clear that \u201ca writ of <em>audita querela </em>may not be granted when relief is cognizable under \u00a7 2255.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1175. It is also clear that the claim Arevalo makes in his <em>audita querela </em>motion \u2014 that his conviction should be collaterally overturned because the Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in <em>United States v. Santos, </em>553 U.S. 507, 128 S.Ct. 2020, 170 L.Ed.2d 912 (2008) applies retroactively \u2014 is cognizable under \u00a7 2255. <em>See e.g., Bousley v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 614, 620-21, 118 S.Ct. 1604, 140 L.Ed.2d 828 (1998) (explaining that where a defendant was convicted \u201cfor an act that the law does not make criminal,\u201d he raises a claim cognizable in a \u00a7 2255 proceeding); <em>Holt, </em>417 F.3d at 1175 (finding that a claim collaterally attacking a conviction based on the retroactive application of a Supreme Court case is cognizable under \u00a7 2255); <em>Gonzalez v. Sec\u2019y for Dept. Of Corr., </em>366 F.3d 1253, 1260 (11th Cir.2004) <em>(en </em>banc), <em>aff'd on other grounds, </em>545 U.S. 524, 125 S.Ct. 2641, 162 L.Ed.2d 480 (2005) (\u201cA \u00a7 2255 motion is aimed at having a judgment of conviction and sentence set aside because of some constitutional violation, jurisdictional defect, or other ground that makes the judgment subject to collateral attack.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b986-17\">Because Arevalo is proceeding <em>pro se, </em>we \u201cmay liberally construe his <em>audita querela </em>motion as a \u00a7 2255 motion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>However, Arevalo has already filed \u00a7 2255 petition that was denied by the district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"959\">*959</page-number>court in 2005. Under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (\u201cADEPA\u201d), a district court can only consider a second or successive \u00a7 2255 petition if the petitioner has first obtained a Certif\u00edcate of Appealability from this Court granting him permission to file a second or successive habeas petition. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(b)(3)(A). Because Arevalo failed to obtain a Certificate of Appealability to challenge his conviction in a second or successive \u00a7 2255 petition, the district court could not have erred in denying his claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b987-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
