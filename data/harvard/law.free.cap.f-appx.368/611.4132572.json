Guidry argues that, because his original sentence was 30% less than the bottom of his original guidelines range of 210-262 months of imprisonment, the district court erred by failing to grant him a 117-month sentence, which would be 30% less than the bottom of his amended guidelines range of 168-210 months of imprisonment. He argues that in so doing, the district court misapplied U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(b)(2)(B) and application note 3 thereto.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-18\">This court reviews the decision whether to reduce a sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Evans, </em>587 F.3d 667, 672 (5th Cir.2009). Reasonableness review, as outlined in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), is not applicable to \u00a7 3582 proceedings. <em>Id. </em>The district court\u2019s interpretation of the Guidelines is reviewed de novo. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b640-19\">The district court was not required to reduce Guidry\u2019s sentence as he alleges. Section lB1.10(b)(2)(B) provides in relevant part: \u201cIf the original term of imprisonment imposed was less than the term of imprisonment provided by the guideline range applicable to the defendant at the time of sentencing, a reduction comparably less than the amended guideline range ... <em>may </em>be appropriate.\u201d (emphasis added). Further, application note 3 to \u00a7 IB 1.10 makes clear that \u201cthe sentencing court has the discretion to determine whether, <em>and to what extent, </em>to reduce a term of imprisonment under [\u00a7 lB1.10(b)(2)(B) ].\u201d (emphasis added). There is no evidence that the district court intended to grant a greater reduction but erred in its mathematical calculation as Guidry intimates.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-20\">Nor was the district court required, as Guidry argues, to explain the rationale for its sentence by making explicit its consid<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>eration of the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors or other policy considerations. As this court recently held in <em>Evans, </em>since \u201ca defendant cannot successfully challenge a district court for failing to provide reasons for <em>denying </em>his motion to reduce his sentence, it is axiomatic that he cannot do so for <em>granting </em>his motion but not providing a satisfactorily low enough sentence.\u201d <em>Evans, </em>587 F.3d at 674 (emphases in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b641-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b640-14\"> Pursuant to 5tii Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
