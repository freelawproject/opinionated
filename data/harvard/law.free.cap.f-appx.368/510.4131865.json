He appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 8582(c)(2) motion for reduction of sentence. We review the district court\u2019s denial of a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Doublin, </em>572 F.3d 235, 237 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b539-5\">McCutcheon argues that the district court abused its discretion by denying his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. He maintains that the district court\u2019s initial drug quantity determination was not supported by sufficient evidence. He contends that <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), is applicable to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceedings and that his sentence should be reduced because of the continuing disparity between sentences for crack cocaine offenses and powder cocaine offenses. He argues that the district court\u2019s previous grant of a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) sentence reduction to him should not have affected the resolution of his present motion. He asserts that the district court violated his equal protection rights because of the disparity between his sentence and the sentence of his co-defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-6\">Section 3582(c)(2) permits the discretionary modification of a defendant\u2019s sentence only where the defendant\u2019s sentencing range is actually lowered by the Sentencing Commission. <em>See Doublin, </em>572 F.3d at 237. Because McCutcheon was held accountable for more than 4.5 kilograms of cocaine base, Amendment 706 did not change his guidelines sentence range. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. Supp. to App\u2019x C, Amend. 706; U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c)(l). Contrary to McCutcheon\u2019s assertion, <em>Booker </em>is not applicable in \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceedings. <em>See Doublin, </em>572 F.3d at 238. McCutcheon\u2019s challenge to the initial drug quantity determination and his equal protection claim are not cognizable in a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding. <em>See United States v. Shaw, </em>30 F.3d 26, 29 (5th Cir.1994). Because \u00a7 3582(e)(2) authorizes a sentence reduction only when the sentencing range is lowered by an amendment to the Guidelines, the district court did not abuse its discretion by denying McCutcheon\u2019s motion for reduction of sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b538-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
