Bates argues, as he did in the district court, that the defendants violated his Fourth Amendment rights when he was arrested on September 21, 2006. Bates also contends that his cause of action did not accrue until February 1, 2008, the date on which he was arrested on charges related to the September 21, 2006 arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-5\">This court reviews a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915 dismissal as frivolous for an abuse of discretion. <em>Norton v. Dimazana, </em>122 F.3d 286, 291 (5th Cir.1997). Because there is no federal statute of limitations for actions brought pursuant to \u00a7 1983, federal courts borrow the forum state\u2019s general personal injury limitations period. <em>Wallace v. Kato, </em>549 U.S. 384, 387, 127 S.Ct. 1091, 166 L.Ed.2d 973 (2007); <em>Owens v. Okure, </em>488 U.S. 235, 249-50, 109 S.Ct. 573, 102 L.Ed.2d 594 (1989). Texas has a two-year limitations period for personal injury actions. Tex. Civ. Prao. and Rem.Code Ann. \u00a7 16.003(a). Nevertheless, federal law determines when a \u00a7 1983 cause of action accrues. <em>Gartrell v. Gaylor, </em>981 F.2d 254, 257 (5th Cir.1993). A cause of action under \u00a7 1983 accrues when the aggrieved party knows, or has reason to know of, the injury or damages which form the basis of the action. <em>Piotrowski v. City of Houston, </em>51 F.3d 512, 516 (5th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b623-6\">Thus, the two-year limitations period began to run on September 21, 2006, the date on which Bates knew of the alleged injury. <em>See Piotrowski, </em>51 F.3d at 516. Because Bates did not sign his \u00a7 1983 complaint until December 18, 2008, his claims are barred by the statute of limitations. Bates\u2019s appeal is without arguable merit and, thus, frivolous. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983). Therefore, it is dismissed as frivolous. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-8\">The dismissal of this appeal and the district court\u2019s dismissal as frivolous count as two strikes under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387-88 (5th Cir.1996). Bates has two previous strikes. <em>See Bates v. Hill, </em>No. 5:07-CV-00263 (N.D.Tex. Mar. 13, 2008); <em>Bates v. Hill, </em>No. 5:07-CV-00128-C (N.D.Tex. Aug. 13, 2007). Because Bates has now accumulated three strikes, he is barred from proceeding in forma pauperis in any civil action or appeal fried while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b623-9\">IFP MOTION DENIED; APPEAL DISMISSED; 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g) BAR IMPOSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b622-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
