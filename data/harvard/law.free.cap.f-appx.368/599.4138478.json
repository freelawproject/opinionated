He argues that the sentence is procedurally and substantively unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-11\">Following <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), we review sentences for reasonableness in light of the factors in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). <em>United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 519-20 (5th Cir.2005). This standard applies whether the sentence is within or outside the guidelines range. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). Pursuant to <em>Gall, </em>we engage in a bifurcated review of the sentence. <em>United States v. Delgado-Martinez, </em>564 F.3d 750, 752 (5th Cir.2009). We first consider whether the district court committed a \u201csignificant procedural error.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 752-53. If there is no such error, we then review the substantive reasonableness of the sentence for abuse of discretion. <em>Id. </em>at 751-53.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-16\">Relying on <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 47, 128 S.Ct. 586, Trejo M\u00edreles asserts the district court procedurally erred by requiring extraordinary family circumstances to justify a further variance below the 46-to-57-month guidelines range of imprisonment. This argument is unavailing. The record as a whole, including the district court\u2019s comments prior to and after sentencing, reflect that the court considered Trejo Mi-reles\u2019s individual circumstances, and there is no indication that the district court required extraordinary circumstances before it would impose a sentence outside of the guidelines range.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-17\">Trejo Mireles\u2019s second point of error, that the district court improperly weighed the sentencing factors of \u00a7 3553(a), also fails. The record reflects that the district court considered the history and characteristics of the defendant; the need for the sentence to promote respect for the law; the need for the sentence to afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct; and the need for the sentence to protect the public from further crimes of the defendant. The record therefore shows that the district court carefully considered and weighed the \u00a7 3553(a) factors at sentencing. Accordingly, Trejo M\u00edreles has failed to demonstrate that the district court erred in weighing the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>Relatedly, Trejo M\u00edreles contends that the sentence is substantively unreasonable because it is greater than necessary to achieve the sentencing goals of \u00a7 3553(a). Trejo Mireles\u2019s appellate argument is, in essence, that this court should reweigh the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. That we \u201cmight reasonably have concluded that a different sentence was appropriate is insufficient to justify reversal of the district court.\u201d <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586. Trejo Mi-reles\u2019s disagreement with the district court\u2019s assessment of his sentence is insufficient to show that his sentence is unreasonable or that the sentence imposed represents an abuse of the district court\u2019s sentencing discretion. <em>See United States v. Rowan, </em>530 F.3d 379, 381 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b629-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b628-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
