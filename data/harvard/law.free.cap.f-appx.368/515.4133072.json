Lee also appeals the district court\u2019s denial of relief on her motion to \u201crevisit\u201d the criminal judgment sentencing her to an 85-month term of imprisonment following her jury trial conviction on one count of being a felon in possession of a firearm. We exercise our authority to consolidate the appeals. <em>See United States v. Rodriguez, </em>564 F.3d 785, 737 (5th Cir.2009); Fed. R.App. P. 3(b)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b544-4\">To obtain a COA in No. 09-10329, Lee must make \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2); <em>Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 336, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003). When, as here, the district court\u2019s denial of federal habeas relief is based on procedural grounds without analysis of the underlying claims, a COA should issue if \u201cthe prisoner shows, at least, that jurists of reason would find it debatable whether the petition states a valid claim of the denial of a constitutional right and that jurists of reason would find it debatable whether the district court was correct in its procedural ruling.\u201d <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">In her Rule 60(b) motion, Lee claimed that her trial and appellate counsel rendered ineffective assistance with respect to an enhancement for possessing a firearm in connection with another felony offense. In support of those claims, she argues in her COA motion that the enhancement was improperly applied. Lee, who has previously unsuccessfully sought relief under \u00a7 2255, does not challenge the district court\u2019s determination that her Rule 60(b) motion was an unauthorized successive \u00a7 2255 motion. Lee has not shown that reasonable jurists would debate the correctness of the district court\u2019s dismissal of her motion under Rule 60(b) as an unauthorized second or successive \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>See Slack, </em>529 U.S. at 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595. Accordingly, a COA is denied in No. 09-10329.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-8\">Lee contends in No. 09-10506 that the enhancement for possessing a firearm in connection with another felony offense was improperly applied. The jurisdictional basis for Lee\u2019s motion to \u201crevisit\u201d her criminal sentencing is unclear; however, the motion, which relied on Amendment 691 to the Sentencing Guidelines, is akin to a motion under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c), which permits the discretionary modification of a defendant\u2019s sentence where the sentencing range is later lowered by the Sentencing Commission, \u201cif such a reduction is consistent with the policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d <em>United States v. Gonzalez-Balderas, </em>105 F.3d 981, 982 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b544-9\">Section 3582(c)(2) only applies to retroactive guideline amendments. <em>See United States v. Shaw, </em>30 F.3d 26, 29 (5th Cir.1994). Amendment 691 is not among the amendments that is subject to retroactive application, and therefore Lee\u2019s challenge to the validity of the enhancement does not entitle her to relief under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) because it is not based on a retroactive amendment to the Guidelines. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(c); <em>Shaw, </em>30 F.3d at 29. The district court did not abuse its discretion in denying relief. <em>See United States v. Boe, </em>117 F.3d 830, 831 (5th Cir.1997). Accordingly, the judgment of the district court in No. 09-10506 is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-10\">CONSOLIDATE NO. 09-10329 WITH NO. 09-10506; COA DENIED IN NO. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>09-10329; JUDGMENT AFFIRMED IN NO. 09-10506.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b543-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
