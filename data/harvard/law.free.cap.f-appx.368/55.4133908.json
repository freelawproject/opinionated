California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). Our independent review of the entire record reveals that counsel\u2019s assessment of the relative merit of the appeal is correct. Because independent examination of the entire record reveals no arguable issues of merit, counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw is GRANTED, and Martinez\u2019s convictions and sentences are AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-15\">However, we notice a clerical error in Martinezr-Padron\u2019s written judgment. The district court orally sentenced Martinez-Padron to 63 months\u2019 imprisonment, but the written judgment states that he received a sentence of 60 months. Since the oral pronouncement controls, <em>see United States v. Khoury, </em>901 F.2d 975, 977 (11th Cir.1990), we VACATE the written judgment and REMAND for the district court to enter a new judgment stating that Martinez-Padron received a sentence of 63 months\u2019 imprisonment. <em>See </em>Fed. R.Crim.P. 36.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
