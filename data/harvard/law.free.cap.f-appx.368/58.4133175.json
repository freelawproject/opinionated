After review, we affirm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b87-5\">Under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), a district court has the authority to modify a defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment if the defendant\u2019s sentence was \u201cbased on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 994(o).\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2); <em>see also </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(l)-(2). Hubbard\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion is based on Amendment 706 to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1, which lowered the base offense levels applicable to most crack cocaine offenses. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. app. C, amends. 706, 713.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-6\">Here, the district court correctly concluded that it lacked authority to reduce Hubbard\u2019s sentence. Hubbard was convicted of conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute five kilograms or more of cocaine powder, not cocaine base. Thus, Amendment 706 had no effect on his sentencing range.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-7\">Hubbard argues that his original sentence was unconstitutionally enhanced based on his prior felony convictions. This argument cannot be raised in a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion because it relates to an original sentencing determination and not to a guidelines amendment that has subsequently lowered Hubbard\u2019s sentencing range. <em>See United States v. Moreno, </em>421 F.3d 1217, 1220 (11th Cir.2005)(explaining that in a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding all original sentencing determinations remain the same except the guidelines range that has since been amended).</p>\n<p id=\"b87-8\">Hubbard\u2019s argument that his original sentence violates <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), is foreclosed by our precedent. <em>See United States v. Melvin, </em>556 F.3d 1190, 1192 (11th Cir.) (concluding that <em>Booker </em>does not \u201cprohibit the limitations on a judge\u2019s discretion in reducing a sentence imposed by \u00a7 3582(c)(2) and the applicable policy statement by the Sentencing Commission\u201d), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 2382, 173 L.Ed.2d 1300 (2009); <em>United States v. Jones, </em>548 F.3d 1366, 1369 (11th Cir.2008) (concluding that <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), does not provide a basis on which to grant a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 1657, 173 L.Ed.2d 1025 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b87-16\">Thus, the district court did not have the authority to reduce Hubbard\u2019s sentence and properly denied his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-17\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b87-9\">. We review <em>de novo </em>the district court's legal conclusions regarding the scope of its authority under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>United States v.
