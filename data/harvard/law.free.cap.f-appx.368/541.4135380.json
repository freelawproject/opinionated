The probation officer recommended sentencing Williams as a career offender pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1. At sentencing, the district court accepted the parties\u2019 stipulation in the agreement that Williams would be sentenced based upon a quantity of crack not less than five grams but no more than 20 grams. Williams appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his pro se motion for a sentence reduction pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). The district court denied Williams\u2019s motion on the basis that he was ineligible since he was a career offender. The Government has moved for summary affirmance, arguing that because Williams was sentenced as a career offender, he was not eligible for relief under \u00a7 3582(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b569-23\">Because Williams\u2019s guideline range was not derived from the quantity of crack <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>cocaine involved in the offense, but rather from his career offender status, the district court was correct in concluding that a sentencing reduction was not permitted. <em>See </em>\u00a7 3582(c)(2). This court will not consider Williams\u2019s argument that he was not sentenced as a career offender since he raises it for the first time in his response to the Government\u2019s motion. <em>See Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 225, 227 (5th Cir.1993); <em>see also United States v. Prince, </em>868 F.2d 1379, 1386 (5th Cir.1989). To the extent Williams contends that he is entitled to a reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) since the amended guideline ranges are advisory under the principles set forth in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), his argument is foreclosed. <em>See United States v. Doublin, </em>572 F.3d 235, 238 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 517, 175 L.Ed.2d 366 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b570-5\">Accordingly, the Government\u2019s motion for summary affirmance is GRANTED, and the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED. The Government\u2019s alternative motion for an extension of time in which to file a brief is DENIED as unnecessary.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b569-25\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
