The portion of the printed policy which sets forth \"Coverages\u201d states that the insurance applies to the perils insured against, for which a premium is stated and for which the plaintiffs had purchased protection, which extended only to the risks specified in the insuring clause. The declarations statement indicates that a premium was paid for only specified risks, but not for all risks, an option the plaintiffs did not elect.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-7\">The plaintiffs\u2019 reliance on <em>Sincoff v Liberty Mut. Fire Ins. Co. </em>(11 NY2d 386) is misplaced. The policy in that case covered all risks to the insureds\u2019 property, and the issue thus became whether the exceptions to that coverage served to exclude the specific hazard which had caused the loss. Here, however, the law of exclusions does not come into play because no coverage existed in the first instance. Accordingly, the Supreme Court erred in granting the plaintiffs any relief under the policy <em>(see, Schiff Assocs. v Flack, </em>51 NY2d 692, 697).</p>\n<p id=\"b446-8\">Although the moving papers did not correctly denominate the application as one for summary judgment, all parties and the court obviously treated it as such <em>(see, </em>22 NYCRR 202.1 [b]). In view of the foregoing, we search the record and grant summary judgment to Allcity <em>(see, </em>CPLR 3212 [b]; <em>Wiseman v Knaus, </em>24 AD2d 869). Bracken, J. P., Miller, Copertino and Pizzuto, JJ., concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
