We have previously held that where the undercover himself testifies that he is still active in the community and is fearful for his safety, the People have made a showing sufficient to warrant closure <em>(People v Santos, </em>154 AD2d 284, <em>lv denied </em>75 NY2d 817), in compliance with <em>Waller v Georgia </em>(467 US 39), particularly since defendant never suggested any other remedy, but objected only on the ground that an insufficient showing had been made <em>(see also, People v Vidal, </em>172 AD2d 228, <em>lv denied </em>78 NY2d 927).</p>\n<p id=\"b189-7\">Similarly, defendant\u2019s claim that he received ineffective assistance of counsel cannot be reviewed on the record before this Court, but is more properly the subject of a CPL 440.10 motion.
