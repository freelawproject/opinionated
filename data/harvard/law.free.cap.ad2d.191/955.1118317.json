Each party sought a declaration that the other\u2019s insurance policy coverage was primary. That determination, however, cannot be made without a review of both policies, and only defendant\u2019s policy is in the record. (Appeal from Order of Supreme Court, Erie County, Joslin, J. \u2014 Declaratory Judgment.) Present \u2014 Callahan, J. P., Pine, Lawton, Boehm and Fallon, JJ.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
