State, </em>\u2014 So.3d - (Fla.2012), which quashed our decision in <em>Castano v. State, </em>65 So.3d 546 (Fla. 5th DCA 2011). The Florida Supreme Court has now confirmed that <em>Padilla v. Kentucky, </em>559 U.S. 356, -, 130 S.Ct. 1473, 1483, 176 L.Ed.2d 284 (2010), is not retroactive, but has nonetheless held that this is a case to which <em>Padilla </em>applies.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-37\">The offense committed by Casta\u00f1o is an offense which clearly subjects her to deportation. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(E)\u00ae (\u201cAny alien who at any time after admission is convicted of a crime of ... child neglect ... is deportable.\u201d); 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(b)(l) (providing that attorney general can cancel removal under certain circumstances, but not if alien had been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>convicted under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)). Because the deportation consequences were clear, we agree with Casta\u00f1o that the standard deportation warning she was given during the plea colloquy fails to satisfy <em>Padilla\u2019s </em>requirement that she be given clear advice regarding the deportation consequence. 180 S.Ct. at 1483. The deportation warning during the plea colloquy was also insufficient to cure the prejudice arising from her counsel\u2019s failure to comply with the requirements of <em>Padilla. Hernandez v. State, </em>\u2014 So.3d-(Fla. 2012); <em>Oropesa v. State, </em>104 So.3d 1183 (Fla. 2d DCA 2012). Thus, we reverse and remand with instructions to reconsider Castano\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-7\">REVERSED and REMANDED WITH INSTRUCTIONS.</p>\n<judges id=\"b75-8\">LAWSON and BERGER, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
