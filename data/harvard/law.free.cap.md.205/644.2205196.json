Petitioner has petitioned for a writ of <em>habeas corpus </em>twenty-four times and all have been denied. This is the first application for leave to appeal to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-12\">Petitioner claims that he was not given a copy of the indictment. He was represented by an attorney at his trial and does not allege that his attorney did not receive a copy. Nor does he allege that he requested one.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-13\">Petitioner further alleges that.he was denied a chance to summon his witnesses. He does not state that he complained to the trial judge about this denial or that his attorney was denied the right to summon witnesses for him. A complaint that a petitioner was refused an opportunity to obtain witnesses is reviewable on appeal, but not on <em>habeas corpus. Bowen v. Warden, </em>202 Md. 646, 96 A. 2d 489; <em>Sears v. Superintendent, </em>202 Md. 656, 97 A. 2d 133; <em>Daisey v. Warden, </em>203 Md. 653, 98 A. 2d 99.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-14\">Petitioner also alleges that perjured testimony was used against him, and that the evidence presented at the trial was not sufficient to justify a conviction. \u201cA bald assertion that perjured testimony was deliberately used against him is insufficient, in the absence of \u2018facts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>showing that the State\u2019s officers used testimony known to be perjured, or participated in any conspiracy to defraud petitioner of his rights.\u2019\u201d <em>Reeder v. Warden, </em>196 Md. 683, 685, 77 A. 2d 1, and cases there cited. Nor is the competency, admissibility, and sufficiency of evidence a basis for the issuance of a writ of <em>habeas corpus. Sembly v.
