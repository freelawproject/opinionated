He was found guilty on the charge of common assault and sentenced to two years in the House of Correction. The judgment was affirmed by this Court in <em>Stokes v. State, </em>202 Md. 166, 95 A. 2d 871.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-11\">Petitioner alleges in his application that the Baltimore City Court, in reaching its verdict, based its judgment on a report read into the record as a stipulation covering the doctor\u2019s examination of the infant and that this constituted error. Alleged errors in the admission of matters in evidence in a trial below are reviewable on appeal but not on <em>habeas corpus. Tyson v. Warden, </em>198 Md. 684, 84 A. 2d 59; <em>Land v. Warden, </em>199 Md. 694, 87 A. 2d 527.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-12\">The petitioner further alleges that there was collusion between the prosecuting attorney and his counsel. Petitioner does not allege that he complained of the services \u00f3f his lawyer at the time of the trial nor does the record show any such complaint. <em>Goodman v. Warden, </em>190 Md. 746, 60 A. 2d 527; <em>Tabor v. Swenson, </em>193 Md. 706, 66 A. 2d 205; <em>Edmondson v. Wright, </em>193 Md. 710, 66 A. 2d 386; <em>State ex rel. Clark v. Swenson, </em>193 Md. 723, 68 A. 2d 676; <em>Obenstine v. Warden, </em>198 Md. 648, 80 A. 2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>610. It is also to be noted that the same counsel represented petitioner in the case in the Court of Appeals as in the lower court.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-5\">Petitioner further complains that his attorney failed to subpoena witnesses as requested by him. He does not allege that summonses were issued for these witnesses or that he expressed to the court his desire for these witnesses. <em>Goodman v. Warden, supra; Tabor v. Swenson, supra; Selby v. Warden, </em>201 Md. 653, 92 A. 2d 756.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-6\">Petitioner also refers to an <em>ex post facto </em>law and that he was deprived of his rights under the First, Sixth, and Fourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution. He does not give any grounds, any reasons, or any facts to support these contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-7\">\n<em>Application denied, with costs.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
