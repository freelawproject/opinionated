He contends that the sentences amounted to double jeopardy, apparently on the grounds that the offenses were charged in separate counts of the same indictment, and that the trial court struck out the first sentence of five years and resentenced him to lesser terms for the various offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-5\">The short answer to these contentions is that a claim of double jeopardy cannot be raised on <em>habeas corpus.
