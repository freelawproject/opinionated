Petitioner was given credit for two days out of the twelve days he spent in the Baltimore City jail. There is no law in this State which requires that a sentence shall date from the time of the defendant\u2019s arrest. <em>Baldwin v. Warden, </em>201 Md. 657, 658, 92 A. 2d 739; <em>Agner v. Warden, </em>203 Md. 665, 666, 667, 99 A. 2d 735. If the ten days which petitioner spent in jail, and for which he claims credit, are added to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>sentence of eighteen months, the total does not exceed the maximum penalty for the offense. Code, (1951), Article 27, Section 96. The Court of Appeals generally has no power to determine the penalty within the statutory limits. <em>Reid v.
