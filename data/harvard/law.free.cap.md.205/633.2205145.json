The petition did not allege any lack of jurisdiction in the Circuit Court, and even' if it had, the Baltimore City Court ruled that it had no jurisdiction to review a decision of a court of concurrent jurisdiction in another judicial circuit. In any event, it is clear that the action of the trial court, under the circumstances, is not reviewable. Cf. <em>Riggs v. Green, </em>118 Md. 218, and <em>Turnpike Co. v. N.C.R.R. Co., </em>15 Md. 193. See also <em>Moore v. License Com. of Pr. Geo.\u2019s Co., </em>203 Md. 502. The appeal must be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-12\">It may be noted that the appeal in this case was docketed as though it were an application for leave to appeal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>from a denial of a writ of <em>habeas corpus, </em>and the appellant has filed a brief in this Court seeking a review of the order of May 26, 1954, \u201cdenying appellant\u2019s application to be heard on <em>habeas corpus </em>proceedings\u201d. If we treat the case as though the petition below had been for a writ of <em>habeas corpus, </em>it is sufficient to say that it states no adequate grounds for relief, since the only grounds alleged are (1) lack of evidence to convict, which cannot be considered on <em>habeas corpus, </em>and (2) denial of due process, which, in the absence of any particularization, is too general to be considered. <em>Hickman v. Warden, </em>203 Md. 668.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-5\">\n<em>Appeal dismissed, with costs.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
