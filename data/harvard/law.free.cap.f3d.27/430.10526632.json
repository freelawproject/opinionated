INTRODUCTION</p>\n<p id=\"b499-23\">The Secretary of Health and Human Services (\u201cSecretary\u201d) appeals the district court\u2019s holding that Gerald Hodge (\u201cHodge\u201d) was not required to offset a state lump-sum disability award (\u201clump-sum award\u201d) against his federal social security benefits. We reverse. Under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 424a(a)(2), Hodge must offset his lump-sum award for the months during which he also received his federal benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-24\">The Secretary argues that the monthly offset amount should be equal to what Hodge had previously received each month in state temporary disability payments. By contrast, Hodge argues that the offset amount should be equal to his lump-sum award divided by the expected number of months remaining in his natural life. We reject both arguments. We conclude that the offset amount should be equal to Hodge\u2019s lump-sum award divided by the number of months between the date of the award and the date Hodge reaches the age of 65.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-25\">II. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b499-26\">Hodge, a 55-year old boilermaker in Oregon, suffered a work-related injury to his right wrist on October 23, 1986. His right wrist was caught and severely twisted by 500-pound tubes as he retubed a boiler. Hodge applied for and received workers\u2019 compensation benefits under Oregon state law. From October 24, 1986 through May 20, 1987 (seven months), Hodge was temporarily disabled and received $344.77 per week in state temporary disability payments.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-27\">The state eventually determined that Hodge had permanently lost the use of 40% <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>of his right forearm. He was deemed permanently injured as of May 20, 1987 and received a state lump-sum award of $4,068.75 for this permanent partial disability.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b500-4\">In addition to the above state benefits, Hodge also applied for and received federal social security benefits. The Social Security Administration awarded him federal benefits for a closed period between October 22, 1986 through February 29, 1988. To avoid a windfall, the Secretary offset Hodge\u2019s lump-sum award of $4,068.75 at a rate of $344.77 per week, the rate at which Hodge\u2019s state temporary disability payments had been made.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-5\">Hodge challenged the Secretary\u2019s decision to offset his lump-sum award and, alternatively, the rate at which his lump-sum award should be offset. The Administrative Law Judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) and Appeals Council both affirmed the Secretary\u2019s decision. In a published decision, the district court reversed the Secretary\u2019s decision to offset Hodge\u2019s award. <em>See Hodge v. Sullivan, </em>791 F.Supp. 256 (D.Or.1992). The court did not reach the offset rate question.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-6\">III. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b500-7\">\n<em>A. Offset of the Lump-Sum Award</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b500-8\"><em>1. Statutory Background. </em>Federal statutory law requires that certain state disability payments \u2014 i.e., \u201cperiodic benefits\u201d \u2014 be offset against federal social security benefits. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 424a(a).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Such \u201cperiodic benefits\u201d must be offset during any month in which federal benefits are also received. <em>Id. </em>Congress intended this to prevent double recovery. <em>See, e.g., </em>S.Rep. No. 404, 89th Cong., 1st Sess., <em>reprinted in </em>1965 U.S.C.C.A.N. 1943, 2040-42.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-18\">We have recognized that the scope of the federal offset provisions is extremely broad. Even lump-sum awards are \u201cperiodic benefits\u201d as long as they are \u201ca commutation of, or a substitute for, periodic payments.\u201d <em>See id. </em>at \u00a7 424a(b);<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>see also Black v. Schweiker, </em>670 F.2d 108, 109-10 (9th Cir.1982) (finding a lump-sum award to be a \u201cperiodic benefit[ ]\u201d); <em>Worley v. Harris, </em>666 F.2d 417, 420 (9th Cir.1982) (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b500-19\"><em>2. Analysis. </em>Hodge argues that his state lump-sum award of $4,068.75 \u2014 a \u201cscheduled\u201d award \u2014 is not a \u201cperiodic benefit\u201d and is therefore not subject to the offset provisions of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 424a(a)(2). Hodge relies principally upon the distinction between \u201cscheduled\u201d and \u201cunscheduled\u201d awards under the Oregon statutory scheme.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-20\">Under Oregon statutory law, a worker who is permanently partially disabled receives ei<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>ther a scheduled or an unscheduled award. Scheduled awards are fixed-sum awards for injuries to certain specified limbs or body parts. <em>See </em>Or.Rev.Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 656.214(2) to .214(4) (1993).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Unscheduled awards are awards for all other injuries. These awards are calculated by determining the \u201cpermanent <em>loss of earning capacity </em>due to the compensable injury\u201d and by reference to the worker\u2019s age, education, impairment, and adaptability to perform a given job. <em>See id. </em>at \u00a7 656.214(5) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b501-4\">As an initial matter, Hodge concedes that \u00ab.rescheduled awards are \u201cperiodic benefits\u201d that are subject to the offset provisions of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 424a(a)(2). Under the Oregon statutory scheme, unscheduled awards are expressly based upon a worker\u2019s \u201closs of earning capacity.\u201d <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 656.214(5). Such awards can therefore be characterized as a stream of payments for the remainder of Hodge\u2019s working life. <em>See Wilson v. Goodrich Co., </em>52 Or.App. 139, 627 P.2d 1280, 1282 n. 1 (1981) (in a products liability ease, characterizing \u201cearning capacity\u201d as the \u201cprojected dollar value of earnings plaintiff would have obtained over his working life had he not been injured\u201d), <em>aff'd, </em>292 Or. 626, 642 P.2d 644 (1982). Accordingly, such awards are \u201cperiodic benefits\u201d and are subject to section 424a(a)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b501-5\">However, Hodge maintains that scheduled awards are <em>not </em>\u201cperiodic benefits\u201d that are subject to the offset provisions of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 424a(a)(2). Under the Oregon statutory scheme, scheduled awards are calculated based upon the value assigned to the body part that is injured. <em>See </em>Or.Rev.Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 656.214(2) to .214(4). Hodge argues that, unlike unscheduled awards, scheduled awards do <em>not </em>depend upon lost earning capacity. Accordingly, scheduled awards are not \u201cperiodic benefits\u201d and need not be offset against federal benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-6\">We disagree. Oregon law clearly rejects Hodge\u2019s distinction between scheduled and unscheduled awards. The Oregon Supreme Court has held that <em>both </em>types of awards\u2014 scheduled and unscheduled \u2014 are intended to cover a claimant\u2019s lost earning capacity:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-8\">The <em>entire </em>scheme of Workers\u2019 Compensation Law is to compensate <em>workers, </em>who are active in the labor market, for wages lost because of <em>inability (or reduced capacity) to work </em>as a result of a compensa-ble injury....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b501-9\"><em>Outright v. Weyerhaeuser Co., </em>299 Or. 290, 702 P.2d 403, 407 (1985) (first and last emphasis added). The court emphasized that \u201cthe legislature intended workers\u2019 compensation benefits to provide <em>wage replacement.\u201d Id. </em>(emphasis added); <em>see also Surratt v. Gunderson Bros. Engineering Corp., </em>259 Or. 65, 485 P.2d 410, 413 (1971) (holding that both unscheduled <em>and </em>scheduled permanent disability awards \u201crelate to loss of earning capacity\u201d (internal quotes omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b501-10\">Of course, scheduled awards may \u201csometimes overstate and sometimes understate the actual loss of earning capacity of the injured individual.\u201d <em>In re Woodman, </em>289 Or. 551, 614 P.2d 1162, 1164 (1980). These discrepancies do not change the basic fact that such awards still represent a stream of lost future wages. The Oregon legislature simply intended to \u201csimplify and expedite settlement of such claims by excluding disputed predictions of the <em>claimant\u2019s future earning capacity.\u201d Id. </em>(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b501-11\">In sum, even though the Oregon legislature has assigned specific dollar amounts to particular body parts, scheduled payments are still \u201cdesigned to compensate for the economic loss of earning capacity.\u201d <em>See id. </em>Accordingly, we cannot accept Hodge\u2019s distinction between scheduled and unscheduled awards. Both types of awards \u201csubstitute for\u201d periodic benefits, <em>see </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 424a(b), and both must be offset to the extent that they overlap with federal benefits in a given month. <em>Accord Davidson v. Secretary of HHS, </em>942 F.2d 90 (1st Cir.1991).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b502-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>\n<em>B. Offset Amount</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b502-4\"><em>1. Overview. </em>Because we conclude that Hodge is required to offset his lump-sum award against his federal benefits, we must now determine the <em>amount </em>to be offset each month. The Secretary argues that the monthly offset amount should be equal to what Hodge had previously received each month in temporary state disability payments (approximately $1,379.08 per month).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> By contrast, Hodge argues that the offset amount should be equal to his lump-sum award divided by the expected number of months remaining in his natural life (approximately $16.47 per month).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> We reject both arguments. We conclude instead that, under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 424a(b), the monthly offset amount should be equal to Hodge\u2019s lump-sum award divided by the number of months between the date of the award and the date Hodge reaches the age of 65.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-5\"><em>2. Background. </em>Federal statutory law requires that lump-sum awards be offset at a rate that will \u201capproximate as nearly as practicable\u201d the rate at which the award would have been paid on a monthly basis. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 424a(b).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> For example, a lump-sum award of $2,400.00 that is intended to compensate a claimant over a two-year period would be offset at a rate of $100.00 per month ($2,400.00 award/24 months). This is because the lump-sum award of $2,400.00 is simply a substitute for a stream of $100.00 monthly payments over a two-year period.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-6\">The Secretary has promulgated policy guidelines for calculating the rate at which various kinds of awards should be offset. <em>See </em>Secretary\u2019s Programs Operations Manual System \u00a7 DI 52001.555(C)(4) [hereinafter POMS]. One provision establishes a three-step procedure for calculating the offset rate for lump-sum awards. The provision states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A0X\">4. AMOUNT AT WHICH TO PRORATE</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-11\">LS [lump-sum] awards will be prorated at an established weekly<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> rate. The priority for establishing weekly rates is as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-12\">a. <em>The rate specified in the LS award. </em>If the LS award specifies a rate based on life expectancy, use that rate to prorate the LS and list under code 557.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-13\">b. <em>The periodic rate paid prior to the LS </em>if no rate is specified in the LS award.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-14\">c. If WC [workers\u2019 compensation], <em>the State\u2019s WC maximum in effect on the date of injury. </em>This figure can be used if no rate is specified in the award and there was no preceding periodic bene-fit_ The State maximum is the periodic rate that, in almost every case, would have been payable had periodic payments been made instead of a LS.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b502-17\"><em>See id. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 DI 52001.55(C)(4)(a) to (C)(4)(c) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b502-18\"><em>3. Analysis. </em>Here, the ALJ found that no offset rate was \u201cspecified\u201d in Hodge\u2019s lump-sum award. Applying the second step of the Secretary\u2019s guidelines, <em>see </em>POMS \u00a7 DI 52001.55(C)(4)(b), the ALJ based the offset rate on a \u201cprior\u201d periodic rate \u2014 i.e., Hodge\u2019s state temporary disability payments of $344.77 per week (approximately $1,379.08 per month). <em>See id. </em>The Appeals Council affirmed. We now reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-19\">While the Secretary\u2019s guidelines are far from clear, we conclude that in this case the ALJ erred by using the \u201cprior\u201d periodic rate. Under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 424a(b), the Secretary must \u201capproximate as nearly as practicable\u201d the rate at which the lump-sum award would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>have been paid on a monthly basis. As we have already explained, under Oregon state law Hodge\u2019s lump-sum award is simply a substitute for a stream of payments for the remainder of his working life. <em>See supra </em>pp. 433-34. Because under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 424a(a) this period is presumed to extend until a person turns 65, we apply that date for the purpose of determining the monthly offsets. Accordingly, the best approximation of the monthly offset rate here, indeed the only possible approximation of that rate, is the amount arrived at by dividing the lump-sum award by the number of months between the date of the lump-sum award and the date Hodge reaches the age of 65.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b503-4\">While it is time that Hodge\u2019s award does not <em>literally </em>specify a monthly offset \u201crate,\u201d the ALJ\u2019s construction of the guidelines here conflicts with the plain language and purpose of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 424a(b). We do not think that the Secretary meant the guidelines to create such a conflict. Rather, we believe that the Secretary intended the guidelines to help\u2014 and not hinder \u2014 the implementation of the statute. Where the monthly offset rate can be determined by the application of established state law, the clear statutory command governs. In such cases, there is simply no need to turn to the guidelines for assistance, and their application is not warranted. Viewing the issue from a different perspective, the guidelines must be read in light of the clear statutory requirement. Under that approach, if the guidelines are to be applied, it must be done in a manner consistent with the statute. In order to do so, we must construe the term \u201caward\u201d as having a broader meaning than the Secretary suggests. Under that view, \u00a7 DI 52001.-55(C)(4)(a) of the guidelines refers not only to a rate set forth <em>in haec verba, </em>but also to a rate specified by operation of law. In short, under either approach, the ALJ should apply the state\u2019s prior periodic rate only where the applicable monthly offset rate is not established by state law.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">Our conclusion is consistent with Ninth Circuit precedent. In <em>Worley v. Harris, </em>666 F.2d 417 (9th Cir.1982), we affirmed the Social Security Administration\u2019s (\u201cSSA\u201d) pro-ration of an Oregon claimant\u2019s lump-sum disability payment in this manner. In <em>Worley </em>we held that, \u201cpursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 424a(b), [the SSA] prorated the lump-sum over the years remaining before appellant attained age 62, the statutory limit for imposing the offset.\u201d <em>Worley, </em>666 F.2d at 419. Congress subsequently amended 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 424a to change the statutory limit to 65. Pub.L. No. 97-35, \u00a7 2208(a)(2) (1981). We conclude that the ALJ in this case erred by failing to prorate Hodge\u2019s lump-sum payment in the manner described in <em>Worley.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b503-9\">4. <em>The </em>Mann <em>Decision. </em>The Secretary\u2019s cites to <em>Mann v. Heckler, </em>1A Unempl. Ins. Rep. (CCH) \u00b6 16,952, 1986 WL 36270 (D.Me. Mar. 17, 1986), <em>aff'd without opinion, </em>802 F.2d 440 (1st Cir.1986), in support of her position. In <em>Mann, </em>a federal district court rejected a Maine claimant\u2019s argument that his state lump-sum settlement of an unspecified duration should have been prorated over the rest of his natural life. The court held that because the award failed to specify any offset rate, the Secretary could properly offset the award at a previous rate at which the claimant had been paid by the state. <em>See id. </em>(applying \u00a7 DI 52001.55(C)(4)(b)). The Secretary subsequently adopted the <em>Mann </em>decision as Social Security Ruling 87-21(e). It is applicable in all circumstances in which guidance is necessary or helpful, and in which the statute does not command a contrary result.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-10\">We conclude that the <em>Mann </em>decision is not applicable to this case. In <em>Mann, </em>the district court had no way of \u201capproximat[ing] as nearly as practicable\u201d the rate at which the claimant\u2019s lump-sum settlement would have been paid on a monthly basis. According to the court: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number><em>Id. </em>(emphasis added). The specific settlement amount in <em>Mann </em>was not dictated by-statute; neither was the specific rate at which that amount would have been paid. The district court did not cite to any Maine state-law cases. By contrast, Oregon state law allows us to \u201capproximate as nearly as practicable\u201d the rate at which Hodge\u2019s lump-sum award would have been paid on a monthly basis. In fact, it does more. It makes it clear precisely what that rate is. Accordingly, we conclude that the <em>Mann </em>decision is not applicable here.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-11\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number><em>For all the court knows </em>or the Secretary could determine, the parties may have concluded that <em>the plaintiff\u2019s disability claims would not last a lifetime, but only for a specific term of years </em>and reached their settlement based upon that view.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b504-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>\n<em>C. Calculation</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">As we explained earlier, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 424a(a) requires Hodge to offset all \u201cperiodic benefits\u201d for all months during which he also received federal benefits. <em>See </em>discussion <em>supra </em>pp. 432-33. Hodge\u2019s lump-sum award is a substitute for a stream of \u201cperiodic benefits\u201d starting on May 20, 1987, and ending on his sixty-fifth birthday. <em>See </em>discussion <em>supra </em>pp. 6604, 6607-9. By contrast, Hodge\u2019s federal benefits were expressly awarded for a \u201cclosed period\u201d between October 22, 1986, and February 29, 1988. <em>See supra </em>p. 432. Accordingly, Hodge\u2019s state and federal benefits overlapped for a period of approximately nine months \u2014 i.e., between May 20,1987, and February 29, 1988. We remand to the district court for determination of the precise amount of benefits Hodge is entitled to receive in light of our holding and all other applicable provisions of law. <em>See, e.g., </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 424a(a)(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b504-6\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b504-7\">We reverse the judgment of the district court. Under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 424a(a)(2), Hodge is required to offset his state scheduled lump-sum award for the nine months during which he also received federal social security benefits. In calculating the monthly offset amount, the district court should divide Hodge\u2019s lump-sum award by the number of months between the date of the award and the date Hodge turns 65. We remand so that the precise amount of benefits to which Hodge is entitled may be calculated.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-11\">REVERSED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b500-9\">.

Proportionate sums are awarded for all losses less than a complete loss.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b501-14\">. Hodge and the court below rely upon <em>Lemire v. Secretary, </em>682 F.Supp. 102 (D.N.H.1988), which held that a New Hampshire lump-sum payment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>did not have to be offset from federal social security benefits. <em>Lemire\u2019s </em>holding was subsequently overruled by the First Circuit in <em>Davidson, </em>however, and thus loses its value as persuasive authority.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b502-8\">. That is, $344.77 per week x 4 weeks = $1,379.08 per month.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b502-9\">. Hodge had a life expectancy of 247 months on the date that he became eligible for his lump-sum award. Thus, $4,068.75/247 months = $16.47 per month.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b502-21\">. For the text of section 424a(b), see note 3 above.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b502-22\">. Proration on a weekly basis is at odds with the statutory mandate of proration on a <em>monthly </em>basis. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 424a(b). Accordingly, we follow the statutory mandate instead of the Secretary's guidelines.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b503-6\">. Hodge's argument that the award should be prorated over his natural life must also be rejected. Under Oregon law, the award is a substitute for a stream of payments for the remainder of Hodge\u2019s working life, <em>see supra </em>pp. 433-34, not over the remainder of his natural life.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
