The statutes are 28 <em>U.S.CA. </em>\u00a7 1658(a), which supplies \u201ca general, 4-year limitations period for any federal statute ... enacted [after December 1, 1990] without one of its own,\u201d <em>N.

Market U.S.A., </em>343 <em>N.J.Super. </em>356, 359-60, 364, 778 A.2d 591 (App.Div.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b489-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>Read together, the statutes raise the question whether Congress intended to apply the \u201ccatchall\u201d four-year limitation period provided in 28 <em>U.S.C.A </em>\u00a7 1658(a) to private actions arising under the TCPA or to defer to local limitation periods. Section 1658 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-5\"><em>Except as otherwise provided by law, </em>a civil action arising under an Act of Congress enacted after the date of the enactment of this section may not be commenced later than 4 years after the cause of action accrues.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-6\">[28 <em>U.S.CA </em>\u00a7 1658(a) (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b489-7\">The TCPA provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-8\">A person or entity may, <em>if otherwise permitted by the laws or rules of court of a State, </em>bring [an action to enjoin or recover damages for a violation of the TCPA or specified regulations promulgated pursuant to the Act] in an appropriate court of that State____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-9\">[47 <em>U.S.C.A </em>\u00a7 227(b)(3) (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b489-10\">The ambiguity is apparent. In making the TCPA\u2019s cause of action available <em>\u201cif otherwise permitted by the laws or rules of court of a State,\u201d </em>did Congress intend to include or exclude <em>\u201cpermissibility </em>\u201d under the limitation period of each state. Stated differently, did Congress intend to <em>\u201cprovide\u201d </em>an <em>\u201cexception\u201d </em>to application of \u00a7 1658\u2019s four-year period, which would \u201cotherwise\u201d govern the civil action established in this post-1990 Act of Congress, in order to permit state courts to apply a state period of limitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-11\">Resolution of the ambiguity requires us to consider the purpose of both statutes. <em>See Jones, supra, </em>541 <em>U.S. </em>at 375-76, 124 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1841-42, 158 L.Ed.2d at 652-53; <em>Wilson v. Garcia, </em>471 <em>U.S. </em>261, 266-75, 105 <em>S.Ct. </em>1938, 1943-46, 85 L.Ed.2d 254, 260-66 (1985). In <em>Jones, supra, </em>541 <em>U.S. </em>at 380, 124 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1844, 158 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 655, the United States Supreme Court concluded that 28 <em>U.S.C.A </em>\u00a7 1658 should be construed to apply broadly. The Court reasoned that the \u201ccentral purpose of \u00a7 1658\u201d is to minimize the complex legal issues and uncertainty for litigants created when Congress establishes a federal cause of action without specifying a limitation period, leaving courts adjudicating federal claims to select the most analogous state law claim and borrow that claim\u2019s limitation period. <em>See id. </em>at 376-79, 124 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1842-44, 158</p>\n<p id=\"b490-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number><em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 653-55. The Court reviewed the difficulties inherent in such \u201climitation borrowing\u201d that led Congress to enact the \u201ccatchall\u201d limitation period:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-5\">Prior to the enactment of \u00a7 1658, the settled practice was to adopt a local time limitation as federal law if it [was] not inconsistent with federal law or policy to do so. Such limitation borrowing generated a host of issues that required resolution on a statute-by-statute basis. For example, it often was difficult to determine which of the forum State\u2019s statutes of limitations was the most appropriate to apply to the federal claim. We wrestled with that issue in <em>Wilson v. Garcia, </em>in which we considered which state statute provided the most appropriate limitation principle for claims arising under 42 <em>U.S.C. </em>\u00a7 1983. [That decision] resolv[ed the] split of authority over whether the closest state analogue to an action brought under \u00a7 1983 was an action for tortious injury to the rights of another, an action on an unwritten contract, or an action for a liability on a statute____Two years later ... we answered the same three questions for claims arising under \u00a7 1981. Both decisions provoked dissent and further litigation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-8\">... Even when courts were able to identify the appropriate state statute, limitation borrowing resulted in uncertainty for both plaintiffs and defendants, as a plaintiff alleging a federal claim in State A would find herself barred by the local statute of limitations while a plaintiff raising precisely the same claim in State B would be permitted to proceed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-9\"><em>[Id. </em>at 377-79, 124 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1842-43, 158 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 654 (citations, internal quotations and footnotes omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b490-10\">In a case decided prior to the enactment of \u00a7 1658, the Court had noted that the difficult practice of \u201cborrowing\u201d limitation periods was also inherently unlikely to produce results that further the purposes of limitation periods. <em>Wilson, supra, </em>471 <em>U.S. </em>at 271, 105 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1944, 85 L.Ed.2d at 263-64. The Court explained that when a federal claim \u201cdiffers from [existing] state cause[s] of action in fundamental respects, the State\u2019s choice of a specific period of limitation is, at best, only a rough approximation of the point at which the interests in favor of protecting valid claims are outweighed by the interests in prohibiting the prosecution of stale ones.\u201d <em>Ibid, </em>(internal quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b490-11\">In <em>Jones, </em>after considering the historical background and the reform efforts that led to the enactment of \u00a7 1658, the Court concluded that the context in which the \u201ccatchall\u201d limitation period was enacted \u201cstrongly supported] an interpretation that fills more rather than less of the void that has created so much unnecessary work for federal judges.\u201d 541 <em>U.S. </em>at 380, 124 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1844, 158 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number><em>L.Ed.</em>2d at 655. For that reason, the Court held that an amendment supplementing an existing statute with a new cause of action, which amendment was \u201cenacted after the date of enactment\u201d of 28 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1658, was subject to \u00a7 1658\u2019s four-year limitation period even though causes of action established under the same statute prior to the enactment of \u00a7 1658 were not. <em>Id. </em>at 382-83, 124 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1845-46, 158 L.Ed.2d at 657-58. Thus, the Court construed section 1658\u2019s \u201cafter the date of enactment\u201d to include as many causes of action as the statutory language reasonably permits.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">We conclude that <em>Jones </em>requires a narrow reading of the phrase \u201c[e]xcept as otherwise provided by law\u201d included in \u00a7 1658 and a similarly narrow reading of language of \u201cexception\u201d included in statutes like the TCPA that were enacted after \u00a7 1658. Consistent with <em>Jones, </em>we hesitate to read general language of exception to infer that Congress intended to create new \u201cvoids\u201d in federal law governing limitation periods and reintroduce the difficulties and confusion that \u00a7 1658 was designed to eliminate. Absent a clear indication of an alternate limitation period, language of exception in post-1990 federal enactments should not be read as intended to override the limitation period provided in \u00a7 1658. Any other approach would undercut the remedial purposes of \u00a7 1658 in favor of application of a period of limitations that \u201cis, at best, only a rough approximation\u201d of a state\u2019s view of a proper balance of the interests furthered by limitation periods. <em>See Wilson, supra, </em>471 <em>U.S. </em>at 271, 105 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1944, 85 L.Ed.2d at 263-64.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-6\">The provisions of the TCPA that make its civil action available only \u201cif otherwise permitted by the laws or rules of court of a State,\u201d 47 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 227(b)(2), (c)(5), provide no clear indication of intent to exclude TCPA claims from the scope of \u00a7 1658. In <em>Zelma </em>we held that the phrase \u201cif otherwise permitted by\u201d state law and court rules was intended to provide states an opportunity to \u201copt-out\u201d of the TCPA and to recognize that states may apply neutral rules and procedures to foreclose TCPA actions. <em>Zelma, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number><em>supra, </em>343 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 360-61, 363-64, 778 A.2d 591.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In reaching that conclusion, we considered the purpose of the phrase as explained by federal courts. <em>See id. </em>at 366, 778 A.2d 591. \u201cCongress understandably avoided opening federal courts to the millions of potential private TCPA claims....Similarly concerned over the potential impact of private actions on the administration of state courts, Congress included a provision to allow the states to prohibit private TCPA actions.....\u201d <em>Ibid, </em>(citation and quotations omitted). The length of a limitation period has no obvious relevance to the volume of litigation or the extent of the burden imposed on courts of this state.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-9\">Similarly, the legislative history of the TCPA\u2019s private cause of action does not support a reading of the phrase \u201cif otherwise permitted\u201d to favor the pre-1990 practice of \u201climitation borrowing.\u201d The TCPA\u2019s sponsor identified the following reasons for making the private cause of action available if \u201cpermitted\u201d by state law and court rules: avoidance of constitutional difficulties inherent in congressional attempts to direct the operations of state courts; and facilitation of recovery of TCPA damages in courts that address \u201csmall claims\u201d and allow recovery without costly litigation. <em>See R.A. Ponte, supra, </em>857 A.2d at 13-14 (quoting the Congressional Record and describing the sponsor\u2019s statement as constituting \u201cthe whole legislative history underlying the private cause of action provision\u201d of the TCPA). Thus, the sponsor\u2019s stated purpose was to simplify TCPA litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-10\">Absent a state limitation period specifically applicable to TCPA claims, the use of state limitation periods based on analogous causes of action under state law would complicate not facilitate pursuit of the private TCPA remedy. We are mindful of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>difficulties that confront state courts and litigants compelled to identify an analogous state cause of action in order to select a limitation period. <em>See, e.g., J.H.R. v. Bd. of Educ. of Tp. of East Brunswick, </em>308 <em>N.J.Super. </em>100, 120 n. 10, 120-24, 705 A.2d 766 (App.Div.1998) (noting that \u00a7 1658 is inapplicable to a claim under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 1400-1491o, because the law was enacted prior to \u00a7 1658, and proceeding to survey State and federal law to determine \u201cmost analogous local time limitation\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">The present case illustrates the difficulty of \u201climitation borrowing.\u201d The most appropriate limitation period for TCPA claims is far from clear. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:14-1 provides a six-year limitation period for actions based on trespass, tortious injury to real property, replevin, and contract claims other than those involving trade between merchants. Receipt of an unwanted facsimile undoubtedly consumes the recipient\u2019s paper and ink, suggesting <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:14-1 could apply. In contrast, receipt of an unwanted phone call made by use of automated dialing might be better characterized as akin to an invasion of privacy, suggesting a two-year limitation period under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:14-2. And, the availability of fixed and treble damages for violation of the TCPA\u2019s prohibitions arguably could support a view of the TCPA\u2019s damage awards as forfeitures or penalties for violation of the Act, suggesting application of either the one or two-year limitation period pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:14-10.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-7\">It is apparent that the attempt to select the most appropriate existing limitation period for TCPA claims will insert complex legal issues in otherwise relatively uncomplicated cases. Equally important, the unnecessary complexity will bring no real benefit to a state, like New Jersey, that has not adopted a specific limitation period for TCPA actions based on a balancing of the interests implicated.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>See Wilson, supra, </em>471 <em>U.S. </em>at 271, 105 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1944, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>85 L.Ed.2d at 263-64. In short, the effort to apply an existing limitation period would reintroduce complexity and uncertainty of the sort that 28 <em>U.S.C.A </em>\u00a7 1658 was designed to eliminate without furthering any state interest Congress sought to protect by making the TCPA private cause of action available only \u201cif otherwise permitted\u201d by state law.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">We hold that absent adoption of a specific, shorter period of limitations expressly applicable to TCPA claims, the four-year limitation period provided in 28 <em>U.S.C.A </em>\u00a7 1658 applies to a TCPA action in the courts of this State. Absent a law of that sort, a TCPA action initiated within the four-year limitation period of \u00a7 1658 is \u201cpermitted,\u201d not prohibited, by the laws of this State, 47 <em>U.S.CA </em>\u00a7 277(b)(3), (c)(5), and the limitation period specified in 28 <em>U.S.CA </em>\u00a7 1658 applies because no law \u201cotherwise provide[s].\u201d <em>See, e.g., Jemiola v. XYZ Corp., </em>126 <em>Ohio </em>Misc.2d 68, 802 N.E.2d 745 (Oh. Ct. Common Pleas 2003) (applying 28 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1658(a) to a TCPA claim without discussion).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>We recognize that the Texas Court of Appeals has considered the issue presented in this case and concluded that the TCPA is a \u201claw\u201d that provides for a limitation period other than the \u201ccatchall\u201d four-year period included in \u00a7 1658. <em>See Chair King, Inc. v. GTE Mobilnet of Houston, Inc., </em>135 S.W.3d 365, 391 (Tex.App. 2004). <em>Chair King </em>was decided only three days after the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Jones, </em>and <em>Chair King </em>does not mention <em>Jones </em>or apply the Supreme Court\u2019s construction of 28 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1658. For that reason, we do not find <em>Chair King </em>persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-6\">Reversed and remanded for further proceedings.
