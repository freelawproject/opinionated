They made a claim through their insurance broker, the Michael Bello Insurance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>Agency, but learned that homeowners insurance coverage bound and thought to have been placed by the Bello Agency with Highlands Insurance Company allegedly had never become effective because Highlands claimed it had never received the insurance application and policy premium payment. Additionally Highlands asserted that the binder issued by the Bello Agency to the Halls was ineffective because the Agency had exceeded the monetary limits of its binding authority under its agency agreement with Highlands.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Suit was accordingly filed by the Halls against the Bello Agency, the agent writing the coverage, Will Frasse, and Chase Manhattan Mortgage Corporation, which they alleged, negligently failed to notify them that there was no hazard insurance in force that covered their mortgaged home and its contents. Thereafter, on December 2, 2002, the Bello Agency and Frasse filed a third-party complaint against Highlands, and Highlands was made a direct defendant by the Halls in an amended complaint filed on January 14, 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-6\">However, in accordance with the request of the State of Texas, by order dated November 6, 2003 and entered pursuant to <em>Tex. Ins. Code Ann. </em>art. 21.28, Highlands, a Texas domiciliary, was placed in receivership by the District Court of Travis County, Texas,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the Commissioner of Insurance of the State of Texas was appointed Receiver,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and a permanent injunction was imposed on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>actions contrary to the Receiver\u2019s direction. Among other things, the November 6 order barred policyholders and claimants asserting claims or causes of action against Highlands from \u201c[m]aking any claim, charge or offset, or commencing or prosecuting any action, appeal, or arbitration, including administrative proceedings, or obtaining any preference, judgment, attachment, garnishment or other lien, or making any levy against\u201d Highlands, Highland\u2019s property or the Receiver except as permitted by <em>Tex. Ins.Code Ann. </em>art. 21.28.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-5\">The Texas court\u2019s order was filed by New Jersey counsel for Prime TEMPUS, Inc., the Special Deputy Receiver for Highlands, in the Superior Court of New Jersey on April 1, 2004 pursuant to the Uniform Enforcement of Foreign Judgments Act (UEFJA), <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:49A-25 to -33. <em>See also Tex. Civ. Prac. </em>&amp; <em>Rem.Code Ann. </em>art. 35.001 to .008. Highlands, relying on the Texas order, thereupon moved for a stay of the actions against it asserted in the Hall matter, and its motion was granted. However, in accordance with the procedures that we set forth in <em>Aly v. E.S. Sutton Realty, </em>360 <em>N.J.Super. </em>214, 230-233, 822 A.2d 615 (App.Div.2003), the judge authorized the Halls to move before the Presiding Judge of the Civil Part to vacate the stay on grounds of hardship. The Halls sought such relief, but it was denied by the court, which found that the Halls had not demonstrated hardship sufficient to warrant that extraordinary remedy. The Halls then moved before us for leave to appeal, which we granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-6\">On appeal, the Halls present the following arguments:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-7\">\n<em>POINT I</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-8\">THE STAY ORDER SHOULD BE VACATED TO AVOID THE POSSIBILITY OF INCONSISTENT VERDICTS, TO AVOID A WASTE OF JUDICIAL RESOURCES AND IN THE INTERESTS OF FAIRNESS.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-9\">\n<em>POINT II</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-10\">NEITHER FULL FAITH AND CREDIT NOR COMITY REQUIRES ENFORCEMENT OF THE TEXAS INJUNCTION.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-11\">\n<em>POINT III</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-12\">TEXAS HAS NOT ADOPTED THE UNIFORM INSURERS LIQUIDATION ACT OR ITS EQUIVALENT AND THE INJUNCTION SHOULD NOT BE ENFORCED IN NEW JERSEY.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-5\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>\n<em>POINT IV</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-6\">THE TEXAS INJUNCTION, IF ENFORCEABLE IN NEW JERSEY, DOES NOT REQUIRE A STAY OF THE NEW JERSEY ACTION.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b609-7\">We affirm the order granting a stay of litigation against Highlands.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-9\">We first address the Halls\u2019 argument that neither full faith and credit nor comity requires New Jersey\u2019s courts to recognize the stay issued by the Texas court. In large measure, that argument has already been considered by us in <em>Aly, supra, </em>360 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 220-227, 822 A.2d 615. Our conclusion there, that the Constitution\u2019s full faith and credit clause, <em>U.S. Const, </em>art. IV, \u00a7 1, as implemented by 28 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1738, was inapplicable to the interlocutory injunction<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> entered by the Pennsylvania court to permit rehabilitation of Legion Insurance Company,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> whereas principles of comity required deference to the Pennsylvania court\u2019s order for a time adequate to serve the needs of rehabilitation, resolves many of the arguments presented by the Halls in this case, and requires little repetition here.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-10\">We emphasize, however, our recognition that, because regulation of the business of insurance has been left to the states and is not the subject of unifying federal control,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> interference by a state with the rehabilitation of an insurer domiciled elsewhere by failing to recognize a stay of litigation \u201cthreatens to adversely interfere <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>with the process of rehabilitation of the insurer to the detriment of [the insurer\u2019s] policyholders nationwide,\u201d invites retaliatory action when a New Jersey domiciled insurer faces rehabilitation, and raises the risk of \u201ca chaotic rush on the assets of an insurer\u201d just when the receiver is seeking to marshal and conserve the insurer\u2019s assets and fiscally re-order the company. <em>Aly, supra, </em>360 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 222-23, 822 A.2d 615. As the New Jersey Commissioner of Insurance, appearing as <em>amicus curiae </em>in <em>Aly </em>noted,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b610-4\">[a] stay imposed during the period of rehabilitation or, if ultimately that process is unsuccessful, any further stay entered for purposes of liquidation, is designed to protect the interests of policyholders, creditors of the insurer and the public in general by affording the Eehabilitator both the time and the tools needed to efficiently utilize the available resources of the insurer to restore it to financial health.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b610-5\"><em>[Aly, supra, </em>360 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 223, 822 A.2d 615 (footnote omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b610-6\">The adoption by New Jersey of the Uniform Insurers Liquidation Act (UILA), <em>N.J.S.A. </em>17:30C-1 to -31, applicable to liquidations and rehabilitations <em>(N.J.S.A </em>17:30C-lc), manifests this State\u2019s recognition of the importance of centralizing the management of delinquency proceedings in the courts of one state and avoiding interference with that management. The UILA, promulgated in 1939, was designed, through the formulation of uniform procedures for use in reciprocal states,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> to eradicate problems caused by the wide distribution of insurer assets and liabilities throughout the states and then-existing differences in the statutes of various states with respect to the treatment of special deposits, preferred claims, securities, set-offs, and the administrative and judicial procedures to be followed when rehabilitation or liquidation of a troubled insurer is required. <em>See </em>Prefatory Note, <em>Uniform Insurers Liquidation Act, </em>13 <em>U.L.A. </em>322 (1986 &amp; Supp. 1991).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b611-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>The purpose, thus, of the UILA is to provide for a uniform, orderly and equitable method of making and processing claims against financially troubled insurers and to provide for fair procedures for rehabilitating the business of such insurers and, if necessary, distributing their assets.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b611-5\"><em>[In re Mutual Benefit Life Ins. Co., </em>258 <em>N.J.Super. </em>356, 368, 609 A.2d 768 (App.Div.1992).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b611-6\">As a United States District Court judge has observed in the context of insurer liquidation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b611-7\">The need for giving one state exclusive jurisdiction over delinquency proceedings has long been recognized in the courts.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b611-8\">Experience has demonstrated that, in order to secure an economical, efficient, and orderly liquidation and distribution of the assets of an insolvent corporation for the benefit of all creditors and stockholders, it is essential that the title, custody, and control of the assets be intrusted to a single management under the supervision of one court. Hence other courts, except when called upon by the court of primary jurisdiction for assistance, are excluded from participation. This should be particularly true as to proceedings for the liquidation of insolvent insurance companies, for the reasons adverted to by Mr. Justice Cardozo in <em>Clark v. Williard, </em>292 <em>U.S. </em>112, [123-24, 54 <em>S.Ct. </em>615, 620, 78 <em>L.Ed. </em>1160, 1167 (1934) <em>][e.g., </em>that insurance companies, being excluded from bankruptcy, would be required to \u201csubmit to dismemberment, however great the waste or inequality,\u201d if receivers are not appointed with powers to conserve and distribute assets].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AXF\"><em>[Ballesteros v. N.J. Prop. Liability Ins. Guaranty Ass\u2019n, </em>530 <em>F.Supp. </em>1367, 1371 (D.N.J.), <em>aff'd, </em>696 F.2d 980 (3d Cir.1982) (quoting <em>Motlow v. Southern Holding &amp; Securities Corp., </em>95 F.2d 721, 725-26 (8th Cir.), <em>cert. denied </em>305 <em>U.S. </em>609, 59 <em>S.Ct. </em>68, 83 <em>L.Ed. </em>388 (1938)).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b611-9\">The UILA permits the entry of injunctions such as that entered by the Texas court. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>17:30C-5.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-10\">Although Texas has not adopted the UILA,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> no principled reason has been advanced to support the argument that a Texas <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>injunction entered in an insurance rehabilitation proceeding should for that reason be ignored in this State, thereby disordering the process of rehabilitation that the Insurance Commissioner of Texas has undertaken.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b612-5\">The Halls argue additionally on appeal that the Texas injunction should be accorded no deference because they were not afforded notice of and an opportunity to be heard in that rehabilitation proceeding. At the outset, we note that no greater rights would have been accorded to them if the insurer to be placed in rehabilitation had been domiciled in New Jersey and thus subject to the UILA. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>17:30C-5 (authorizing the entry of an injunction \u201cwithout notice\u201d). Moreover, that neither the procedures of Texas nor New Jersey, though lacking in notice, are constitutionally infirm has been established without effective challenge in <em>Ballesteros, supra, </em>530 <em>F.Supp. </em>at 1371. There, in the context of a similar challenge to the order of a New York court, Judge Sarokin, after noting that a rehabilitation action is an <em>in rem </em>proceeding, <em>id. </em>at 1370, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b612-6\">Plaintiffs argument ... misconceives the nature of a rehabilitation proceeding, which is designed to immediately preserve the assets of an impaired company---If notice were required to be issued to all policyholders, and all policyholders had a right to participate in the hearing, the attendant delay would defeat the policyholders' interest in preventing the dissipation of the company\u2019s assets. Because the interests of policyholders are represented by the Superintendent and protected by the state court, due process is not violated by the failure to give notice of the rehabilitation proceedings to the policyholders.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b613-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number><em>[Id. </em>at 1371.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b613-6\"><em>See also, Janak v. Allstate Ins. Co., </em>319 <em>F.Supp. </em>215, 217-18 (W.D.Wisc.1970).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> None of the eases upon which the Halls rely in expressing a contrary view concern insolvency proceedings, and are thus distinguishable.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-7\">The Halls also argue that the Texas receivership action is \u201cunfair, arbitrary and makes no legal sense\u201d in that third-party claims are being paid, whereas first-party claims such as theirs are stayed. But no evidence has been presented to us that would suggest that the Halls have ever sought to present their claim against Highlands to the Special Deputy Receiver, as mandated by <em>Tex. Ins.Code Ann. </em>art. 21.28, despite the fact that, as of May 2005, a claims filing deadline has not been set. Thus, the Halls can have no knowledge as to how their claim would have been treated by the Receiver if it in fact had been properly presented. \u201cReceipt of the required proof of claim is a condition precedent to the payment of any claim.\u201d <em>Tex. Ins.Code Ann. </em>art. 21.28 \u00a7 3(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b613-8\">Moreover, we note that, upon receipt of proof of claim, a receiver has the discretion to approve or reject that claim, and upon rejection, a claimant may file an action against the receiver in the court hearing the receivership proceeding. <em>Tex. Ins.Code Ann. </em>art. 21.28 \u00a7 3(h). Entry of an injunction in the Highlands rehabilitation proceeding did not result in a permanent ban on policyholder claims, but merely required that they be presented to the Receiver in accordance with Texas law.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-9\">Contrary to the Halls\u2019 arguments, Texas does not distinguish between third-party liability claims and first-party claims for purposes of payment, both constituting Class 2 claims. <em>See Tex. Ins.Code Ann. </em>art. 21.28 \u00a7 8(a)(2)(B)\u00a9 (defining the class, in relevant part, as consisting of \u201c[a]ll claims by policyholders, beneficiaries, insureds, and liability claims against insureds covered under insurance policies and insurance contracts issued by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>insurer\u201d). Further, the November 6 order authorized the Receiver to pay approved Class 2 claims under policies of insurance pursuant to <em>Texas Ins.Code Ann. </em>art. 21.28 \u00a7 8(b), but declared that \u201c[n]o payments shall be made on any claims that are not approved by the Receiver.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b614-5\">The claim against Highlands filed on behalf of Fuller-Austin Insulation Company and paid by the Receiver following a settlement markedly reducing its amount, to which the Halls refer as exhibiting evidence of unfairness, was a Class 2 claim, as would be the Halls\u2019 claim.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The Halls present no proof that payment of the Fuller-Austin claim in any way affects their ability to recover on their own claim, which as we have stated, remains unperfected. The Halls\u2019 forecast that payment of the Fuller-Austin claim would lead to the liquidation of Highlands has not yet been proven true (although Highlands remains in rehabilitation). Indeed, it can be argued that the payment significantly enhanced Highlands\u2019 financial position, since it caused the dismissal of a garnishment action that had frozen $800,000,000 of Highlands\u2019 assets.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>As a final matter, the Halls claim that enforcing a stay of their claim against Highlands exposes them to the risk of inconsistent verdicts when their action against the Bello Agency and Frasse is tried<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> and fails to promote judicial efficiency. We note that this risk can be eliminated by entry of a stay applicable to all defendants, relief that the Halls have never sought and apparently do not wish.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-6\">As a consequence of the foregoing, we find no grounds for distinguishing the Halls\u2019 position from that occupied by the claimants in <em>Aly </em>or for finding the rehabilitation scheme of Texas so different from that of New Jersey that principles of comity are rendered inapplicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-8\">When we turn to the issue of whether the Halls have demonstrated a hardship sufficient to warrant interference with the ordered scheme of insurer rehabilitation overseen by the Texas court, we find insufficient evidence to support so drastic a step.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b615-9\">In reaching this conclusion, we are guided by the discussion of the types of hardship warranting relief found in <em>Aly, supra, </em>360 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 230-32, 822 A.2d 615, each of which, we find, was of catastrophic proportion. Although we recognize that the illustrations utilized there are not all-inclusive and that circumstances constituting hardship other than those that we have enumerated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>may arise, and while we recognize and appreciate the Halls\u2019 distress, we do not find such circumstances here.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-4\">The Halls are both well-educated. They retain their relative youth and their essential health. Their financial circumstances are reasonably secure<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> and, if augmentation is required, no evidence suggests an inability on the part of Lora Hall to resume work in the financial industry that she voluntarily terminated more than six years ago. Although they have not received any insurance proceeds as the result of their claim against Highlands, the Halls did receive approximately $160,000 from another insurer on their fire loss claim, which amount does not appear to have been utilized for repairs. The sale of the Halls\u2019 fire-damaged house for $1,040,000, although undoubtedly at a price lower than would have been realized if intact, still resulted in a profit to the Halls of approximately $292,000. At the time of Lora Hall\u2019s deposition in this matter, the Halls lived in a three-bedroom rented residence in Mountain Lakes, the town where they lived prior to the fire. Despite the Halls\u2019 claim that this residence is not comparable to their prior home, they can in no way argue that they have been deprived of essential shelter. As a final matter, we agree with the judge who denied the Halls\u2019 hardship application when he found that the Halls\u2019 private decision to forego children at this time because of uncertainties resulting from their failure to obtain an insurance recovery from Highlands and from this litigation does not constitute the type of true hardship that would permit a lifting of the Texas stay to permit the Halls\u2019 unperfected claim to be heard.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-5\">The order of the trial court enforcing the stay of litigation entered in the Highlands rehabilitation proceeding is therefore affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b607-7\">The Bello Agency's binding authority on policies of the sort the Halls allegedly procured was $350,000. Coverage bound by Bello Agency employee Will Frasse consisted of $380,000 for the dwelling, $38,000 for other structures, $226,000 for personal property, and $76,000 for loss of use, for a total of $720,000.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b607-8\"> The order contained a finding of jurisdiction by the court over the parties (the State of Texas and Highlands) and the subject matter, a legal principle confirmed by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Underwriters Natn\u2019l Assur.

After entry of the order of rehabilitation, and filing of Fuller-Austin\u2019s proof of claim, that claim was settled for $30,500,000, and payment of that amount was authorized by the Receiver, with the approval of the Texas court, which occurred on July 28, 2004.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b615-10\"> Summary judgment was granted to defendant Chase Manhattan Mortgage Corporation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b615-11\"> We decline to distinguish that aspect of <em>Aly </em>discussing hardship applications on the grounds suggested by Highlands, <em>e.g., </em>that the Texas injunction is permanent whereas the Pennsylvania injunctions in <em>Aly </em>were of relatively short duration, and the injunction at issue in <em>Aly </em>covered actions against both the insurer and its insureds, whereas the latter is not covered by the Texas injunction.
