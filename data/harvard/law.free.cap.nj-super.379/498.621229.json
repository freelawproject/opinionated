On defendant\u2019s direct appeal, we vacated defendant\u2019s burglary conviction. On remand the trial judge increased the sentence for aggravated assault from five years with two-and-one-half years without parole eligibility to an extended term nine-year sentence with two-and-one-half years to be served before parole eligibility, the same aggregate sentence that had been imposed before the burglary conviction was reversed. Defendant argues that the revised sentence, including the increased sentence for the aggravated assault, violates his state and federal constitutional double jeopardy and due process rights, and that \u201cthis offense and this offender do not warrant a persistent offender discretionary extended term, and the trial court abused its discretion in imposing a nine-year extended term,\u201d particularly because the trial judge initially denied the State\u2019s application for an extended term. By supplementary letter brief, the defendant further argues that the \u201cimposition of the discretionary offender extended term violated defendant\u2019s constitutional rights to trial by jury and due process of law\u201d under <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 <em>U.S. </em>296, 124 <em>S.Ct. </em>2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), because the presumptive term cannot be raised without a required jury fact-finding and that the sentence must be reduced to four years. We conclude that an extended term was appropriately imposed on the remand but we remand again for resentencing in light of <em>State v. Natale, </em>184 <em>N.J. </em>458, 878 A.2d 724 (2005) <em>(Natale II).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b508-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-9\">Defendant was convicted at a jury trial of third degree burglary and third degree aggravated assault. At sentencing, the trial judge denied the State\u2019s motion for an extended term sentence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>under the persistent offender statute, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:44-3a. The judge concluded that given defendant\u2019s criminal record, the statutory predicates for imposing an extended term sentence had been satisfied. However, the judge was \u201cnot satisfied that under the circumstances of this particular case that [he] needfed] [to impose] additional time to protect the public,\u201d apparently because of his ability to impose consecutive ordinary term sentences for the two crimes.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">The court found these aggravating factors to be applicable: <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:44-l(a)(3), the risk defendant would commit another offense, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:44-l(a)(6), the extent of defendant\u2019s prior record and the seriousness of the crimes of which he was convicted, and <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:44-l(a)(9), the need to deter defendant and others from violating the law. The court also found one mitigating factor, that defendant\u2019s imprisonment \u201cwould entail excessive hardship to himself or his dependents,\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:44-lb(ll), based on the fact that defendant would not be able to support his children. However, the judge was \u201cclearly convinced\u201d that the aggravating factors outweighed the sole mitigating factor, and concluded that, \u201calthough defendant qualifies as a persistent offender, the Court has sufficient penal exposure as a result of the conviction [sic] to protect the public.\u201d The judge considered \u201cthe burglary and the aggravated assault which took place [thereafter] on the street as deserving separate punishments,\u201d and imposed a five-year term, with two-and-one-half years without parole, to be served on the aggravated assault conviction, and a consecutive four year term on the burglary conviction. The aggregate term imposed therefore was nine years, with two-and-one-half years to be served without parole.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-7\">Defendant appealed to us and, in an unpublished decision, we affirmed the assault conviction, vacated the burglary conviction based on insufficient evidence to sustain the conviction,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>\u201cremanded for entry of an amended judgment of conviction.\u201d <em>State v. Young, </em>No. A-5682-00T4 (App.Div. March 6, 2003) (slip op. at 8-10). In addressing defendant\u2019s sentence, we were \u201csatisfied the judge\u2019s findings on the aggravating and mitigating factors were based on competent and credible evidence in the record ... and [the sentence] does not constitute an abuse of discretion,\u201d and because the burglary conviction was vacated noted the possibility that the issue of an extended term could be \u201crevisit[ed]\u201d on the remand. The matter was therefore remanded \u201cfor entry of an amended judgment of conviction and any other appropriate proceedings.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">The prosecutor thereafter renewed his motion for imposition of an extended term. At defendant\u2019s resentencing in May 2003, the trial judge again found that defendant qualified for an extended term sentence because of his status as a persistent offender. He further noted that the \u201creversal of the burglary count [by this court] undermined [the trial court\u2019s] rationale in not imposing the extended term,\u201d and concluded that he would impose an extended term even though he had not done so when he first sentenced defendant. He further concluded that a five year sentence for the aggravated assault charge, the ordinary maximum for a third degree crime, was \u201cinadequate to protect the public\u201d and stated that he would have granted the original extended term motion had the assault been the \u201conly\u201d offense before him at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-6\">The court then found that the same aggravating and mitigating factors applied, notwithstanding the reversal of defendant\u2019s burglary conviction, and that an extended term above the presumptive term of seven years was appropriate based on aggravating factors three, six and nine as previously found, and independent of the convictions which qualified defendant as a persistent offender. Therefore, the judge imposed a nine-year extended term sentence on the third degree aggravated assault conviction. After noting that he was bound by the law not to increase the original parole ineligibility period, the court imposed a parole ineligibility term of two-and-one-half years on the nine year sentence. Accordingly, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>the same aggregate sentence was imposed on remand. Appropriate fines and penalties were also imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-7\">Defendant first asserts that the imposition of a more severe sentence on the assault conviction upon his resentencing violated his constitutional rights. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-8\">Generally, double jeopardy attaches once a defendant begins to serve a prison term or the sentence is partially executed. <em>See State v. Ryan, </em>86 <em>N.J. </em>1, 429 A.2d 332 (1981). Therefore, a defendant who has begun to serve a sentence ordinarily cannot be resentenced to an increased or enhanced term. <em>See, e.g., State v. Espino, </em>264 <em>N.J.Super. </em>62, 67, 624 A.2d 27 (App.Div.1993). However, a defendant who appeals an underlying conviction along with the sentence imposed has no legitimate expectation of finality in either. <em>State v. Haliski, </em>140 <em>N.J. </em>1, 21, 656 A.2d 1246 (1995) (citing <em>State v. Rodriguez, </em>97 <em>N.J. </em>263, 478 A.2d 408 (1984)). Thus, if a defendant\u2019s appeal results in a merger of two or more offenses, the defendant can be resentenced without violating the double jeopardy clause of the federal and state constitutions, as long as the new sentence in the aggregate is not in excess of the originally imposed sentence. <em>Rodriguez, supra, </em>97 <em>N.J. </em>at 277, 478 A.2d 408.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-9\">In <em>Rodriguez, </em>the defendant was convicted of several crimes including felony murder and robbery, for which he was given separate sentences. On defendant\u2019s appeal, the felony murder and robbery charges were merged, and the Supreme Court held that double jeopardy principles did not preclude the resentencing of the defendant after he began to serve his sentence. <em>Id. </em>at 265-66, 478 A.2d 408. The Supreme Court noted that because the defendant had appealed the substantive convictions underlying his sentence, he could have no legitimate expectation of finality regarding that sentence. <em>Id. </em>at 271, 478 A.2d 408. The Court further noted that the situation was considerably different from the case in which defendant\u2019s original convictions remained undis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>turbed and only the sentence was altered on appeal. <em>Ibid. Compare State v. Matlock, </em>49 <em>N.J. </em>491, 231 A.2d 369, <em>cert. denied, </em>389 <em>U.S. </em>1009, 88 <em>S.Ct. </em>572, 19 L.Ed.2d 606 (1967), where the defendant did not successfully attack his underlying convictions, but rather demonstrated that his sentence was \u201cin excess of the statutory maximum.\u201d <em>Rodriguez, supra, </em>97 <em>N.J. </em>at 272, 478 A.2d 408 (citing <em>Matlack, supra, </em>49 <em>N.J. </em>at 501-02, 231 A.2d 369). The <em>Rodriguez </em>court did \u201cnot perceive any unfairness to defendant if he were resentenced ... to a term not in excess of that originally imposed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 273, 478 A.2d 408 (citations omitted). As stated by Justice Handler, Rodriguez \u201ccould be resentenced without offending constitutional principles of double jeopardy providing that any new sentence was in accordance with the substantive punishment standards under the New Jersey code of criminal justice and not in excess of the sentence originally imposed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 277, 478 A.2d 408.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>See also State v. Crouch, </em>225 <em>N.J.Super. </em>100, 107-110, 541 A.2d 1092 (App.Div.1988) (upholding consecutive sentence for the convictions of unmerged assault and robbery after a post-conviction relief court deemed the robbery conviction to constitute second, not first, degree crime).</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">The principles announced in <em>Rodriguez </em>were extended to include the situation where a defendant successfully challenged the imposition of a consecutive sentence. <em>Espino, supra, </em>264 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 68-69, 624 A.2d 27. The defendant\u2019s only legitimate expectation of finality was deemed to preclude only an increase of the original aggregate sentence. <em>Id. </em>at 72, 624 A.2d 27.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-6\">Espino originally received consecutive sentences aggregating a twenty-year term, ten years to be served without parole, <em>id. </em>at 64-65, 624 A.2d 27, but we concluded that the imposition of a consecutive sentence, with respect to the two most serious of<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>fenses, was inappropriate, and therefore remanded for resentencing. <em>Ibid. </em>On remand the defendant was resentenced to an aggregate term of fifteen years, seven-and-one-half years without parole, which was less than his original sentence. <em>Id. </em>at 66, 624 A.2d 27. On his second appeal, defendant argued that Due Process and Double Jeopardy principles were violated because the resentencing court imposed a period of parole ineligibility on a count on which it was not originally imposed, and made the count consecutive to other convictions although it had originally been made to run concurrent. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b513-6\">In rejecting Espino\u2019s argument on the second appeal, we noted that <em>State v. Rodriguez </em>held that an \u201cincreased term for a particular offense may be imposed under some circumstances without violating due process or double jeopardy guarantees,\u201d <em>Espino, supra, </em>264 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 67, 624 A.2d 27 (citing <em>Rodriguez, supra, </em>97 <em>N.J. </em>at 263, 478 A.2d 408). We concluded that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b513-7\">the essential rationale of <em>Rodriguez </em>extends to a ease such as this in which a defendant successfully challenges his sentence on appeal and the ease is remanded for resentencing. A defendant who claims that part of his sentence fails to comply with applicable sentencing guidelines has a lack of a legitimate expectation of finality in his sentence similar to a defendant who claims one of his convictions should merge into another. In both situations, the defendant should be aware that the trial court in molding a consecutive sentence \u201cwill normally make an overall evaluation of the punishment for the several offenses involved.\u201d Consequently, we conclude that a defendant should reasonably expect that if a sentence which is to be served consecutively to other sentences imposed for the same criminal episode is found to be legally deficient, the trial court may reconsider other parts of the overall sentence to assure that defendant receives a proper punishment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b513-8\"><em>[Id. </em>at 68-69, 478 A.2d 408 (citations and footnote omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b513-9\">Defendant notes that <em>Rodriguez </em>relates to a merger of offenses on defendant\u2019s appeal and <em>Espino </em>relates to defendant\u2019s challenge to a sentence implicating the expectation of finality. He suggests that the expectation is different when, as here, the original appeal successfully challenges a <em>conviction </em>and the sentence on the surviving conviction is subsequently increased on remand. Due process values are also implicated. <em>See North Carolina v. Pearce, </em>395 <em>U.S. </em>711, 89 <em>S.Ct. </em>2072, 23 L.Ed.2d 656 (1969) (prohibiting an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>increased sentence for a single conviction on remand). Although well stated, we reject the argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">As developed by the <em>Espino </em>court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-6\">[In] <em>Pennsylvania v. Goldhammer, </em>[474 <em>U.S. </em>28, 106 <em>S.Ct </em>353, 88 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>183 (1985)], a defendant convicted of 112 counts of theft and forgery was sentenced to a custodial term of two to five years on one count and probationary or suspended terms on the remaining counts. On appeal, the conviction for which defendant had been sentenced to a custodial term was reversed, but his convictions for some offenses for which he had received suspended sentences were affirmed. The Supreme Court held that resentencing defendant to a custodial term for the offenses affirmed on appeal would not violate the Double Jeopardy Clause, <em>noting </em>that \u201cthe decisions of this Court \u2018clearly establish that a sentencing in a noncapital case] does not have the qualities of constitutional finality that attend an acquittal.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id., </em>474 <em>U.S. </em>at 30, 106 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 353-54, 88 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 186 (quoting <em>United States v. DiFrancesco, </em>449 <em>U.S. </em>117, 134, 101 S.Ct. 426, 436, 66 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>328, 344 (1980)).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-7\">In <em>United States v. Pimienta-Redondo, supra, </em>874 F.2d 9 [(1st Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>493 <em>U.S. </em>890, 110 <em>S.Ct </em>233, 107 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>185 (1989)], the defendant was convicted of two drug offenses arising out [of] the same activity and received consecutive sentences of five years for each offense, for an aggregate term of ten years. On appeal, the court reversed one conviction, and subsequently the trial court resentenced the defendant to a ten year sentence for the surviving conviction. The First Circuit held that this increased sentence did not violate defendant\u2019s rights under either the Due Process or Double Jeopardy Clauses.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-8\">[264 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 70, 624 A.2d 27.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b514-9\">In <em>Espino </em>we noted that when the conviction on one or more counts is vacated on appeal, the sentencing court should be able to review what remains of its original sentence plan and to reconstruct the sentence to ensure that the punishment fits both the crime and the criminal. <em>Id. </em>at 70-71, 624 A.2d 27 (citing <em>Pimienta-Redondo, supra, </em>874 <em>F.</em>2d at 14). We concluded, as we do now, that the defendant\u2019s resentencing did not violate his double jeopardy rights, since the defendant\u2019s only expectation was that his original aggregate sentence would not be increased. <em>Id. </em>at 72, 624 A.2d 27. The fact that the resentence was not greater than the original sentence also satisfies the legitimate due process-vindictiveness concern that flows from defendant\u2019s original appeal. <em>Id. </em>at 73, 624 A.2d 27. <em>See also Pearce, supra, </em>395 <em>U.S. </em>at 725, 89 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2080, 23 L.Ed.2d at 669.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-10\">After defendant\u2019s burglary conviction was reversed, he was resentenced to the same aggregate term. Thus, although the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>sentence on the assault conviction was increased, there was no double jeopardy or due process violation since the overall sentence remained the same. Significantly, in this case the trial judge, in imposing the original sentence, clearly indicated that he would have imposed an extended term but for his ability to impose a consecutive sentence. <em>Cf. State v. Womack, </em>206 <em>N.J.Super. </em>564, 503 A.2d 352 (App.Div.1985), <em>certif. denied, </em>103 <em>N.J. </em>482, 511 A.2d 658 (1986) (imposition of ineligibility term). <em>See also Monge v.

Those determinations remain untouched by this decision.
