We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-10\">The accident giving rise to the claims occurred on August 7, 1999. Plaintiff was a passenger in a motor vehicle owned and operated by defendant Martinez, which collided with a vehicle driven by defendant James Salerno after the latter vehicle had run a stop sign.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-11\">The motions for summary judgment were based on the verbal threshold contained in <em>N.J.SA. </em>39:6A-8(a), a provision of the Automobile Insurance Cost Reduction Act of 1998 (AICRA or \u201cthe Act\u201d), <em>N.J.SA. </em>39:6A-1.1 to -35. Defendants contended, inter alia, that plaintiffs injuries did not satisfy statutory requirements for prevailing on a claim for non-economic injuries. We view the factual allegations, as the trial court was obliged to do in evaluating the motions for summary judgment, in the light most favorable to the non-movant, plaintiff. <em>See Brill v. Guardian Life Ins. Co., </em>142 <em>N.J. </em>520, 540, 666 A.2d 146 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b124-12\">At the time of the accident, plaintiff was taken to a hospital. She complained of pain in her neck, whole back, face, and shoulders. X-rays were normal. A physical examination in the emergency room revealed contusions on plaintiff\u2019s face and chest, with shoulder pain referred by the neck.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>An initial examination conducted thereafter by a neurologist at plaintiffs behest resulted in a finding of \u201cpost-traumatic lumbar sprain/strain injury.\u201d The physician was, at the time, unable to exclude bilateral lumbar radiculopathy and lumbar facet syndrome. However, as noted by the trial court, a subsequent \u201cneedle EMG disclosed evidence of bilateral lumbosacral radiculopathy, suggestive of acute denervation and with subacute [reinnervation].\u201d A chiropractic evaluation on behalf of plaintiff resulted in diagnoses of \u201ccervical sprain strain with vertebrogenic pain pattern!;] ... thoracic sprain strain complex[;] ... right cheek burn[;] ... left sided L5/S1 radiculopathy[;] ... post traumatic stress syndrome, with associated nervousness, fatigue, depression and anxiety!;] ... lumbar sprain strain!; and] ... right shoulder contusion.\u201d An MRI study of plaintiffs lumbar region had disclosed no abnormalities. The reports of plaintiffs\u2019 physicians also contained opinions regarding causation and permanency.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-6\">A defense examination by a neurologist disclosed the existence of \u201cneurological impairment for sciatic radiculitis ... which is very mild but definite and ... causally related to the accident.\u201d The defense expert acknowledged that these injuries \u201crestrict the functioning of [plaintiffs] body and its members!.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b125-7\">After setting out the objective showings, along with plaintiffs subjective complaints and her allegations of the effect her injuries had had on her everyday activities, Judge Sapp-Peterson decided the motions for summary judgment adversely to plaintiff on the basis that she had made no adequate prima facie showing of a qualifying injury, <em>i.e., </em>objective credible medical evidence of a serious and permanent injury within the descriptive parameters of the Act. The judge concluded that \u201c[i]n the present matter, plaintiffs injuries fall short!.]\u201d She noted that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-8\">X-rays of [plaintiff] taken at the emergency room ... following the accident[ ] were negative for fractures and showed no loss of lordotic curve. The ER room physician diagnosed plaintiff with neck and back contusions. Plaintiffs treatment was limited to chiropractic care for a period of three months. At the end of three months, the range of motion for cervical spine was 83 percent to 100 percent. As to her lumbar spine, the area alleged to have suffered permanent injury, plaintiffs range of motion exceeded normal limits.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>In addition, an MRI of plaintiffs lumbar spine revealed no such musculoskeletal injury or nerve root involvement, and was essentially normal. The imaging revealed no herniations, spasms, or bulges. The injuries observed by the neuropsychiatrist are not definitive and, indeed, ... observations which are suggestive of a condition do not satisfy the verbal threshold.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">The judge went on to determine, also, that \u201c[t]here is insufficient evidence ... of a structural injury to support plaintiffs subjective complaints.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b126-6\">Plaintiff advances two arguments on appeal. She contends that she has \u201csuffered an objectively determined injury, thus satisfying the objective prong of [the] <em>Oswin v. Shaw </em>[, 129 <em>N.J. </em>290, 609 A.2d 415 (1992) ] test;\u201d and that she has \u201cdemonstrated significant subject limitation on her life as required by <em>Oswin v. Shaw.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"Ag\">After a detailed review of the record based upon the arguments advanced by the parties and prevailing standards of law, we are in substantial agreement with Judge Sapp-Peterson\u2019s evaluation that the asserted injuries did not meet statutory standards. We discern nothing in the Supreme Court\u2019s recent holdings in <em>DiProspero v. Penn, </em>183 <em>N.J. </em>477, 874 A.2d 1039 (2005), and <em>Serrano v. Serrano, </em>183 <em>N.J. </em>508, 874 A.2d 1058 (2005), that modifies plaintiffs obligation under <em>Oswin </em>to make a prima facie showing that any injury she sustained was sufficiently serious as a matter of objective evaluation \u2014 as well as permanent \u2014 to warrant inclusion under the bargained-for \u201climitation-on-lawsuit\u201d coverage available under the statutory verbal threshold. <em>See Oswin, supra, </em>129 <em>N.J. </em>at 314-18, 609 A.2d 415; <em>Serrano, supra, </em>183 <em>N.J. </em>at 518, 874 A.2d 1058 (plaintiff is required to prove a qualifying injury \u201cby objective clinical evidence\u201d). It is not apparent to us that the statutory modification of the verbal threshold from nine categories to six, and the new articulation of covered injuries, freed any plaintiff of his or her burden to establish physical impairment satisfying the underlying intendment for a qualifying injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-7\">Because plaintiff has failed to satisfy the first criterion of the Act, <em>i.e., </em>she has not established, as a prima facie matter, that her alleged injuries fall within the serious-permanent-injury standard still embodied within the currently enumerated categories of inju<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>ry under the Act, the recent decisional development in <em>DiProspero </em>and <em>Serrano </em>eliminating the need, under AICRA, to make a showing that the conditions alleged have had a sufficiently serious lifestyle impact has no bearing on the outcome of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
