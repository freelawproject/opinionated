(temporarily assigned).</author>\n<p id=\"b135-13\">A purchaser of Goodyear tires filed a class action suit against companies which produce, manufacture and sell carbon black, a primary ingredient in tires. At issue in this appeal is whether an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>indirect purchaser of an allegedly price-fixed product may state a claim for antitrust violations under the New Jersey Antitrust Act (ATA), <em>N.J.S.A. </em>56:9-1 to -19, and the New Jersey Consumer Fraud Act (CFA), <em>N.J.SA. </em>56:8-1 to -20. We hold that neither statute provides a cause of action to a pass-through purchaser such as the putative class plaintiff, and reverse the order of the Law Division denying defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss plaintiff\u2019s complaint under <em>Rule </em>4:6-2(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">In November and December 2001, plaintiff Louis Sickles purchased from the Goodyear Auto Service Center in Cherry Hill, New Jersey, two Goodyear tires (P215/70R15 97S SI Regatta 2 XNWRPTL) for his wife\u2019s vehicle and one Goodyear tire (P205/65 R15 92H SI Eagle HP VSBLRPTL) for his vehicle. He then filed an action alleging violations of the ATA and CFA, seeking damages on behalf of</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b136-6\">[a]ll persons residing in the state of New Jersey who purchased any product that was manufactured using Carbon Black sold by Defendants from January 1999 through November 2002.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b136-9\">Defendants are Cabot Corporation (Cabot); Phelps Dodge Corporation (Phelps Dodge); Columbian Chemicals Company (Columbian); Degussa Engineered Carbons, LP (DEC); Degussa AG; and Degussa Corporation. Cabot, a Delaware corporation with its principal place of business in Massachusetts, is the world\u2019s largest producer of carbon black, accounting for one-quarter of the worldwide production capacity and market share. Phelps Dodge is a New York corporation with its principal place of business in Arizona and wholly owns the subsidiary Columbian, which is engaged in the manufacture and sale of carbon black within the United States and throughout the world and maintains a carbon black facility in Ulysses, Kansas. DEC, a limited partnership with its principal place of business in New Jersey, is co-owned by Degussa AG and engages in the manufacture and sale of carbon black throughout the world.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-10\">Carbon black is a mixture of partially burned hydrocarbons produced by a combustion of natural gas. It is used as a reinforcing agent in rubber products such as tires, tubes, cables <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>and conveyor belts and is the primary ingredient in car and truck tires. It is also used as an ingredient in countless other products such as dry-cell batteries, electrical conductors, and carbon brushes, and as a pigment in printing, carbon paper, typewriter ribbon inks, paints, photocopier toner and record discs.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-6\">The complaint alleged that defendants and their co-conspirators engaged in anti-competitive activities in violation of the ATA to artificially raise, stabilize, and maintain the price of carbon black sold by defendants from January 1999 through November 2002, resulting in plaintiff and other similarly situated consumers paying more for tires containing carbon black than they would have in the absence of defendants\u2019 alleged unlawful conduct. Plaintiff further claimed that defendants coordinated and cooperated with one another to implement output restrictions and price increases and agreed not to compete against one another to increase their respective market shares. Plaintiff also alleged these acts constituted an unconscionable practice under the CFA.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-7\">By order of November 29, 2004, the trial court denied defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss plaintiffs complaint for failure to state a claim. On February 24, 2005, we granted defendants\u2019 motion for leave to appeal. Defendants raise the following issues on appeal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A3\">\n<em>POINT I</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-8\">THE [ATA] DISALLOWS INDIRECT PURCHASER CLAIMS.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-9\">1. The Harmonization Provision of the [ATA] Directs Conformity To Federal Antitrust Precedents, and Thus Prohibits Plaintiffs Claims.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-10\">2. The New Jersey Legislature Rejected An <em>Illinois Brick </em>Repealer Bill.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-11\">3. The Trial Court Erred in Failing To Follow <em>Illinois Brick </em>and in Misapplying <em>ABC America.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-12\">\n<em>POINT II</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-13\">THE [ ]CFA DOES NOT ALLOW PLAINTIFF\u2019S CLAIM.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-14\">1. The [ ]CFA Does Not Cover Any Antitrust Claims Whatsoever.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-15\">2. The [ ]CFA Cannot Be Used To Make An End Run Around the [ATA\u2019s] Bar of Indirect Purchaser Claims.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b137-16\">We find these arguments persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-17\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b137-18\">We recognize the indulgent standard that applies to review of complaints in the context of a motion to dismiss for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>failure to state a claim. <em>Printing Mart-Morristown v. Sharp Electronics Corp., </em>116 <em>N.J. </em>739, 771-72, 563 A.2d 31 (1989). A motion to dismiss under <em>Rule </em>4:6-2(e) should be \u201capproach[ed] with great caution\u201d and should only be granted in \u201cthe rarest of instances.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>We must view the allegations with great liberality and without concern for the plaintiffs ability to prove the facts alleged in the complaint. <em>Id. </em>at 746, 563 A.2d 31.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-5\">However, a court must dismiss the plaintiffs complaint if it has failed to articulate a legal basis entitling plaintiff to relief. <em>Camden County Energy Recovery </em>Assocs., <em>L.P. v. New Jersey Dep\u2019t of Envtl. Prot., </em>320 <em>N.J.Super. </em>59, 64, 726 A.2d 968 (App.Div.1999). \u201cA motion to dismiss a complaint under <em>Rule </em>4:6\u2014 2(e) for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted must be evaluated in light of the legal sufficiency of the facts alleged in the complaint.\u201d <em>Donato v. Moldow, </em>374 <em>N.J.Super. </em>475, 482, 865 A.2d 711 (App.Div.2005). The plaintiff\u2019s obligation on a motion to dismiss is \u201cnot to prove the case but only to make allegations, which, if proven, would constitute a valid cause of action.\u201d <em>Leon v. Rite Aid Corp., </em>340 <em>N.J.Super. </em>462, 472, 774 A.2d 674 (App.Div.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b138-6\">We review such a motion by the same standard applied by the trial court; thus, considering and accepting as true the facts alleged in the complaint, we determine whether they set forth a claim upon which relief can be granted. <em>Donato, supra, </em>374 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 483, 865 A.2d 711.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b138-8\">The ATA was passed in 1970 \u201cto promote the unhampered growth of commerce and industry throughout the State by prohibiting restraints of trade which are secured through monopolistic practices and which act or tend to act to decrease competition between and among persons engaged in commerce and trade.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>56:9-1 (Historical and Statutory Notes). Under the ATA, \u201c[a]ny person who shall be injured in his business or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>property by reason of a violation of the provisions of this act may sue therefor and shall recover threefold the damages sustained by him, together with reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees, filing fees and reasonable costs of suit.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>56:9-12.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-6\">We follow federal antitrust law in interpreting our own antitrust statute. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>56:9-18 (\u201cThis act shall be construed in harmony with ruling judicial interpretations of comparable Federal antitrust statutes and to effectuate, insofar as practicable, a uniformity in the laws of those states which enact it.\u201d). <em>See also Pomanowski v. Monmouth County Bd. of Realtors, </em>89 <em>N.J. </em>306, 313, 446 A.2d 83 (1982) (Because the ATA is patterned after the Sherman Antitrust Act, courts have \u201cconcluded that federal court interpretations of federal law constitute persuasive authority as to the meaning of the particular state enactments.\u201d) (quoting <em>State v. Lawn King, Inc., </em>84 <em>N.J. </em>179,192, 417 A.2d 1025 (1980)).</p>\n<p id=\"b139-7\">Passed by Congress in 1890, the Sherman Act, 15 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1, declares illegal \u201c[e]very contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce among the several States, or with foreign nations____\u201d Section 4 of the Clayton Act, 15 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 15, provides a private right of action to \u201cany person who shall be injured in his business or property by reason of anything forbidden in the antitrust laws.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b139-10\">This private right, however, does not extend to indirect purchasers, as only overcharged direct purchasers, and not others in the chain of manufacture or distribution, are parties \u201cinjured in [their] business or property\u201d within the meaning of the Clayton Act. <em>Illinois Brick Co. v. Illinois, </em>431 <em>U.S. </em>720, 97 <em>S.Ct. </em>2061, 52 L.Ed.2d 707, <em>reh\u2019g denied, </em>434 <em>U.S. </em>881, 98 <em>S.Ct. </em>243, 54 L.Ed.2d 164 (1977). In <em>Illinois Brick </em>the State of Illinois, on behalf of itself and 700 municipalities who were indirect purchasers of concrete block, brought an antitrust action under Section 4 of the Clayton Act, alleging concrete block manufacturers and distributors had fixed prices of the concrete block in violation of Section 1 of the Sherman Act. <em>Id. </em>at 726-27, 97 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2065, 52 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>713. As in the present ease, the plaintiffs did not purchase the products directly from the defendants. Rather, the plaintiffs \u201c[sought] to demonstrate that masonry contractors, who incorporated [defendants\u2019] block into walls and other masonry structures, passed on the alleged overcharge on the block to general contractors, who incorporated the masonry structures into entire buildings, and that the general contractors in turn passed on the overcharge to [plaintiffs] in the bids submitted for those buildings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 735, 97 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2069, 52 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 718. Thus, the block passed through two separate levels in the chain of distribution before reaching the plaintiffs. <em>Id. </em>at 726, 97 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2065, 52 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 713.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">The Supreme Court held that the entire antitrust remedy belongs to, and only to, direct purchasers, <em>i.e., </em>those who purchased the affected product directly from the defendants, and that indirect or pass-through purchasers, <em>i.e., </em>those who purchased the defendants\u2019 product further down the distribution chain, have no standing under federal antitrust law. As the Court reasoned,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ASk\">[plermitting the use of pass-on theories under \u00a7 4 essentially would transform treble-damages actions into massive efforts to apportion the recovery among all potential plaintiffs that could have absorbed part of the overcharge from direct purchasers to middlemen to ultimate consumers____[This] would add whole new dimensions of complexity to the treble-damages suits and undermine their effectiveness.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-8\"><em>[Id. </em>at 737, 97 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2070, 52 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 719.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b140-9\">This rationale was consistent with the Court\u2019s holding in <em>Hanover Shoe, Inc. v. United Shoe Machinery Corp., </em>392 <em>U.S. </em>481, 88 <em>S.Ct. </em>2224, 20 L.Ed.2d 1231 (1968), an antitrust action brought under Section 4 of the Clayton Act against a manufacturer of shoe machinery by one of its customers, a manufacturer of shoes. The Court rejected as a matter of law the defense that the retailer plaintiff as a direct purchaser had not been injured in its business as required by the statute because it had passed on the claimed illegal overcharge to its customers who were indirect purchasers of defendant\u2019s shoe machinery. <em>Id. </em>at 494, 88 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2232, 20 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 1241-42.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>In <em>Illinois Brick, </em>the Supreme Court reaffirmed its holding in <em>Hanover Shoe, </em>concluding the rationale in that case could not justify unequal treatment of plaintiffs and defendants with respect to the permissibility of pass-on arguments:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-6\">The principal basis for the decision in <em>Hanover Shoe </em>was the Court\u2019s perception of the uncertainties and difficulties in analyzing price and output decisions \u201cin the real economic world rather than an economist\u2019s hypothetical model,\u201d ... and of the costs to the judicial system and the efficient enforcement of the antitrust laws of attempting to reconstruct those decisions in the courtroom. This perception that the attempt to trace the complex economic adjustments to a change in the cost of a particular factor of production would greatly complicate and reduce the effectiveness of already protracted treble-damages proceedings applies with no less force to the assertion of pass-on theories by plaintiffs than it does to the assertion by defendants____Indeed, the evidentiary complexities and uncertainties involved in the defensive use of pass-on against a direct purchaser are multiplied in the offensive use of pass-on by a plaintiff several steps removed from the defendant in the chain of distribution. The demonstration of how much of the overcharge was passed on by the first purchaser must be repeated at each point at which the price-fixed goods changed hands before they reached the plaintiff.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-9\"><em>[Illinois Brick, supra, </em>431 <em>U.S. </em>at 731-33, 97 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2067-68, 52 L.Ed.2d at 716-17 (internal citation omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b141-10\">Additionally, the Court reasoned if both direct and indirect purchasers were permitted to recover, antitrust defendants would be exposed to duplicate damages for the same injury. <em>Id. </em>at 746-47, 97 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2075, 52 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 725-26.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-11\">In response to <em>Illinois Brick, </em>several state legislatures amended their antitrust acts to include a so-called <em>\u201cIllinois Brick </em>repealer\u201d expressly granting standing in antitrust treble-damage actions to indirect purchasers, including the ultimate consumers.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In <em>Cali</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number><em>fornia v. ARC America Corp., </em>490 <em>U.S. </em>93, 109 <em>S.Ct. </em>1661, 104 L.Ed.2d 86 (1989), the Supreme Court upheld the right of states to allow suits by indirect purchasers under their own antitrust statutes, notwithstanding the federal rule limiting federal antitrust recoveries to direct purchasers. The Court found that \u201c[g]iven the long history of state common-law and statutory remedies against monopolies and unfair business practices, it is plain that this is an area traditionally regulated by the States.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 101, 490 <em>U.S. </em>93, 109 <em>S.Ct. </em>1661, 104 L.Ed.2d at 94-95 (footnote omitted). In concluding that state indirect purchaser statutes were not pre-empted by federal law, the Court stated, \u201cnothing in <em>Illinois Brick </em>suggests that it would be contrary to congressional purposes for States to allow indirect purchasers to recover under their own antitrust laws.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 103, 109 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1666, 104 <em>L.Ed.2</em>d at 96.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">Not only has our Legislature not enacted a repealer amendment in response to <em>Illinois Brick, </em>but when an attempt was made, the bill was never reported out of committee. (Assembly Bill No. 4629, March 11,1991). The bill proposed to amend <em>N.J.S.A. </em>56:9-12 of the ATA to allow recovery to \u201c[a]ny person who shall be injured <em>directly or indirectly </em>in his business or property by reason of a violation of the provisions of this act.\u201d The statement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>accompanying the bill expressly referenced the <em>Illinois Brick </em>holding and stated it was intended to</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AQ\">clarify that under the [ATA], indirect purchasers of goods and services are permitted to seek damages in antitrust cases. The bill would create a presumption that in the absence of a preponderance of evidence to the contrary, the final indirect purchaser of goods and services is the party actually injured in the antitrust violation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-6\">[Statement to Assembly Bill No. 4629 (March 11, 1991).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b143-7\">In the present case, the trial judge recognized our courts\u2019 obligation to follow federal law in construing the ATA and, under <em>Illinois Brick, </em>that federal antitrust law prohibits indirect purchaser suits. He further acknowledged that our Legislature declined to pass an <em>Illinois Brick </em>repealer. The judge concluded, however, that a claim asserting an antitrust violation by an indirect purchaser, such as plaintiff, is cognizable under both the ATA and CFA. His rationale was based on the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling in <em>ARC America </em>permitting states to allow indirect purchaser suits, the broad language of <em>N.J.S.A </em>56:9-12 which grants standing to <em>\u201c[aJny person </em>who shall be injured in his business or property\u201d to bring an action under the ATA for an antitrust violation, and the absence of express statutory language prohibiting indirect purchasers from suing under the ATA. (Emphasis added). The judge further concluded that plaintiffs \u201cput forth a cause of action based on defendants\u2019 alleged price fixing, which ... can be construed as ... an unconscionable commercial practice\u201d under the CFA.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-8\">We decline to adopt this rationale. We are persuaded, instead, by the logic and analysis of Judge Miniman in <em>Island Mortgages of New Jersey v. 3M, </em>373 <em>N.J.Super. </em>172, 860 A.2d 1013 (Law Div.2004), denying standing to a putative class of purchasers of invisible and transparent tape products to assert an antitrust claim against 3M, a tape manufacturer, under the CFA. The plaintiffs, who purchased 3M products through independent retailers, alleged that \u201c3M engaged in a course of unconscionable conduct aimed at restricting the access of plaintiffs and the class to lower-priced transparent tape offered by 3-M competitors\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>through tactics such as a rebate structure which rewarded retailers for refusing to carry private label Scotch tape and providing cash incentives for entering into exclusive arrangements with defendant. <em>Id. </em>at 175-76, 860 A.2d 1013. According to the plaintiffs, \u201c[t]he effect of such arrangements was to prevent retailers from offering lower cost private label Scotch tape to plaintiffs and the class\u201d causing \u201csignificant harm to class members by increasing the price they have paid for transparent tape above competitive levels and/or by denying them a free choice in a competitive market, as well as the benefits of innovation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 176, 860 A.2d 1013. As in the present case, the plaintiffs rested their CFA claim on the legal theory that 3M\u2019s alleged monopolistic conduct was, by itself, an unconscionable commercial practice actionable under the CFA <em>Id. </em>at 177, 860 A.2d 1013.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-5\">The court acknowledged the CFA should be \u201capplied broadly to accomplish its remedial purpose, namely to root out consumer fraud.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 176, 860 A.2d 1013 (quoting <em>Lemelledo v. Beneficial Mgmt. Corp. of Am., </em>150 <em>N.J. </em>255, 264, 696 A.2d 546 (1997)). Nevertheless, the court granted the defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss under <em>Rule </em>4:6-2(e), concluding the plaintiffs had \u201cfailed to set forth any factual allegation that would satisfy the requirement that a claim for unconscionable commercial practices demonstrate \u2018a capacity to mislead[,]\u2019 \u201d a fundamental predicate for maintaining a claim under the CFA <em>Island Mortgages, supra, </em>373 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 177, 860 A.2d 1013 (citing <em>Fenwick v. Kay America Jeep, Inc., </em>72 <em>N.J. </em>372, 378, 371 A.2d 13 (1977); <em>New Jersey Citizen Action v. Schering-Plough Corp., </em>367 <em>N.J.Super. </em>8, 13, 842 A.2d 174 (App. Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>178 <em>N.J. </em>249, 837 A.2d 1092 (2003); and <em>Leon v. Rite Aid Corp., </em>340 <em>N.J.Super. </em>462, 470-72, 774 A.2d 674 (App.Div.2001)).</p>\n<p id=\"b144-6\">Aternatively, the court dismissed the plaintiffs\u2019 complaint on the grounds that, as indirect purchasers, they lacked standing to pursue antitrust claims under the CFA. <em>Island Mortgages, supra, </em>373 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 177-78, 860 A.2d 1013. The court reasoned that indirect purchasers would lack standing to pursue claims under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>the ATA based on the harmonizing provision of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>56:9-18 and the Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>Illinois Brick, </em>which deprives indirect consumers of standing under the Clayton Act. <em>Id. </em>at 179-80, 860 A.2d 1013. Accordingly, the plaintiffs were precluded from attempting to recast the very same antitrust conduct as a CFA claim. <em>Ibid. </em>The court insightfully stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b145-6\">This court finds that plaintiffs\u2019 attempt to bring suit under the [CFA] is in direct conflict with the well-founded policies interpreting federal and New Jersey antitrust law. Plaintiffs in this ease allege conduct that is traditionally classified under antitrust law. Although the CFA should be broadly applied, in this instance, allowing plaintiffs to move forward with their suit would undermine the standing requirements of the [ATA]. \u201cIt is basic in the construction of legislation that every effort should be made to harmonize the law relating to the same subject matter.\u201d <em>State v. Green, </em>62 <em>N.J. </em>547, 554, 303 A.2d 312, 316 (1973).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b145-7\"><em>[Id. </em>at 180, 860 A.2d 1013.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b145-8\">We recognize that the ATA does not expressly restrict the right of action to direct purchasers injured by antitrust violations. It is clear, however, based on the holding in <em>Illinois Brick, </em>the harmonization clause of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>56:9-18, and the failed attempt by our Legislature to amend the ATA with an <em>Illinois Brick </em>repealer, that an indirect purchaser is precluded from suing for antitrust violations under the ATA. The United States Supreme Court unequivocally held in <em>Illinois Brick </em>that indirect or pass-through purchasers, <em>i.e., </em>those who purchased a manufacturer\u2019s product further down the distribution chain, have no standing under federal antitrust laws for damages caused by price-fixing. The Court expressly found that indirect purchasers were not parties \u201cinjured in [their] business or property\u201d under Section 4 of the Clayton Act. <em>Illinois Brick, supra, </em>431 <em>U.S. </em>at 728-29, 97 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2061, 52 L.Ed.2d at 714-15. In <em>ARC California, </em>the Court merely held that state indirect purchaser laws, so-called <em>Illinois Brick </em>repealers, were not pre-empted by federal law, notwithstanding the <em>Illinois Brick rule </em>limiting federal antitrust recoveries under the Clayton Act to direct purchasers. The decision did not create a cause of action for indirect purchasers to pursue.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-9\">Our Legislature specifically incorporated federal precedent, providing in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>56:9-18 that the ATA \u201cshall be con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>strued in harmony with ruling judicial interpretations of comparable Federal antitrust statutes____\u201d This is a mandatory, not a permissive statute. As our antitrust act was patterned after the Sherman Act, we have consistently \u201cacknowledged the significance of federal antitrust decisions in the interpretation of our State antitrust law.\u201d <em>Monmouth Chrysler-Plymouth, Inc. v. Chrysler Corp., </em>102 <em>N.J. </em>485, 494, 509 A.2d 161 (1986) (citing <em>Pomanowski, supra, </em>89 <em>N.J. </em>at 313, 446 A.2d 83; <em>Lawn King, supra, </em>84 <em>N.J. </em>at 179, 417 A.2d 1025). The language of our ATA conferring the right to treble-damage recovery on \u201c[a]ny person who shall be injured in his business or property\u201d by antitrust violations, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>56:9-12, is identical to Section 4 of the Clayton Act.</p>\n<p id=\"AaZ\">In <em>Illinois Brick, </em>the United States Supreme Court rendered a decision directly on point construing that language and limiting federal antitrust recoveries to direct purchasers. Although we recognize that a piece of legislation may not be reported out of committee for a variety of reasons unrelated to its substance and that legislative inaction is not conclusive, the fact that in 1991 our Legislature expressly considered, and rejected, an <em>Illinois Brick </em>repealer amendment to the ATA, clearly signals its agreement with <em>Illinois Brick. See, e.g., Garden State Farms, Inc. v. Bay, </em>77 <em>N.J. </em>439, 453, 390 A.2d 1177 (quoting 2A <em>Sutherland Statutory Construction, </em>\u00a7 48.18 at 225 (Sands ed., 4th ed. 1973)) (\u201c \u2018[C]aution must be exercised in using the action of the legislature on proposed amendments as an interpretative aid\u2019 in discerning legislative intent.\u201d). Thus, in the absence of an <em>Illinois Brick </em>repealer or other language by our Legislature evidencing an intent to permit indirect, as well as direct purchasers, to recover for antitrust violations, it is clear New Jersey courts are directed to follow the <em>Illinois Brick </em>holding.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>Plaintiff brought this antitrust action seeking to recover treble damages under the ATA on behalf of all residents of New Jersey \u201cwho purchased any product that was manufactured using Carbon Black sold by Defendants from January 1999 through November 2002.\u201d As the pleadings clearly indicate that plaintiffs putative class is comprised of indirect or pass-through purchasers, plaintiff has no standing to bring suit against defendants under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>56:9-12 for alleged antitrust violations. Accordingly, defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim under <em>Rule </em>4:6-2(e) should have been granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-6\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b147-7\">Nor can this putative class plaintiff maintain an action seeking damages for monopolization, price-fixing, and other anti-competitive activities under the CFA. Enacted in 1960, the CFA \u201cwas passed in response to widespread complaints about selling practices which victimized consumers.\u201d <em>Fenwick, supra, </em>72 <em>N.J. </em>at 376, 371 A.2d 13. It was intended to \u201croot out consumer fraud\u201d and protect consumers by eliminating \u201csharp practices and dealings in the marketing of merchandise and real estate whereby the consumer could be victimized by being lured into a purchase through fraudulent, deceptive or other similar kind of selling or advertising practices.\u201d <em>Lemelledo, supra, </em>150 <em>N.J. </em>at 266, 696 A.2d 546 (quoting <em>Daaleman v. Elizabethtown Gas Co., </em>77 <em>N.J. </em>267, 271, 390 A.2d 566 (1978)). The CFA empowers private plaintiffs to recover for treble damages, attorneys fees and costs upon a demonstration of an \u201cascertainable loss of moneys or property, real or personal\u201d as a result of an unlawful practice as defined by the act. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>56:8-19. The CFA declares the following to be an unlawful practice:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>The act, use or employment by any person of any unconscionable commercial practice, deception, fraud, false pretense, false promise, misrepresentation, or the knowing, concealment, suppression, or omission of any material fact with intent that others rely upon such concealment, suppression or omission, in connection with the sale or advertisement of any merchandise or real estate, or with the subsequent performance of such person as aforesaid, whether or not any person has in fact been misled, deceived or damaged thereby____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-6\"><em>[N.J.S.A </em>56:8-2.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b148-7\">The phrase \u201cunconscionable commercial praetiee[,]\u201d added to the definition of \u201cunlawful practice\u201d in 1971, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>56:8-2, <em>L. </em>1971, <em>c. </em>247, \u00a7 1 (June 29, 1971), has been defined by our Supreme Court as acts lacking \u201cgood faith, honesty in fact, and observance of fair dealing.\u201d <em>Cox v. Sears Roebuck &amp; Co., </em>138 <em>N.J. </em>2, 18, 647 A.2d 454 (1994). \u201c[C]apacity to mislead is the prime ingredient of deception or an unconscionable commercial practice.\u201d <em>Fenwick, supra, </em>72 <em>N.J. </em>at 378, 371 A.2d 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-8\">Plaintiffs complaint is bereft of any allegation that defendants used deception, fraud or misrepresentation or concealed material facts concerning the sale of carbon black to the putative class of consumers. Plaintiff does not allege that defendant carbon black manufacturers made any misrepresentations to him, fraudulently concealed any carbon black pricing information from him, or had communication or contact of any kind with him. Nor does he assert that defendants\u2019 price-fixing of carbon black, an ingredient in tires, lured him into, or even influenced, his decision to purchase Goodyear tires. Even with every reasonable inference of fact and the most liberal construction, <em>Printing Mart-Morristown, supra, </em>116 <em>N.J. </em>at 746, 563 A.2d 31, these claims cannot be read into plaintiffs lawsuit. Plaintiffs sole legal theory under the CFA is that defendants\u2019 alleged monopolistic conduct constitutes an unconscionable commercial practice. Plaintiff has failed to set forth any factual allegations to demonstrate \u201ca capacity to mislead\u201d as there is nothing inherently misleading in defendants\u2019 alleged acts of controlling the supply and overcharging for the price-fixed products.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-9\">Moreover, the putative class plaintiff lacks standing to pursue his CFA claim. The CFA was enacted to help eradicate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>consumer fraud, not to \u201cadvance public policy in favor of competition and prevent practices which deprive consumers of the benefit of competitive markets\u201d which is the \u201coverriding purpose of the New Jersey Antitrust Act.\u201d <em>Ideal Dairy Farms, Inc. v. Farmland Dairy Farms, Inc., </em>282 <em>N.J.Super. </em>140, 175, 659 A.2d 904 (App. Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>141 <em>N.J. </em>99, 660 A.2d 1197 (1995). Plaintiff alleges only that defendants\u2019 price-fixing and monopolistic conduct resulted in higher-priced tires. Thus, for us to permit an indirect purchaser, such as plaintiff, to recast his antitrust claim as a consumer fraud violation would undermine the standing requirements of the ATA and would \u201cessentially permit an end run around the policies allowing only direct purchasers to recover under the Antitrust Act.\u201d <em>Abbott Labs., Inc. v. Segura, </em>907 S.lV.2d 503, 506 (Texas 1995); <em>see also Blewett v. Abbott Labs., </em>86 <em>Wash App. </em>782, 938 P.2d 842 (1997), <em>review denied, </em>133 <em>Wash. 2d </em>1029, 950 P.2d 475 (1998) (denying an indirect purchaser standing to recover for antitrust conduct through a lawsuit under its consumer fraud act). <em>Cf. Mack v. Bristol-Myers Squibb Co., </em>673 So.2d 100 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.1996), <em>review dismissed, </em>689 So.2d 1068 (1977) (permitting indirect purchasers to sue under Florida\u2019s consumer protection statute which contained language protecting consumers from \u201cunfair methods of competition\u201d in addition to unconscionable, deceptive and unfair acts).</p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">Although we recognize our antitrust and consumer fraud statutes are to be liberally interpreted, their remedial provisions are not without limit. In analyzing and interpreting these statutes in light of their context, historical background, policy considerations, legislative history, case law, and policy considerations, we are satisfied our holding advances the intent and spirit of the ATA and CFA.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">As plaintiffs, indirect consumers, do not have a valid cause of action against defendants under either the ATA or the CFA, defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss plaintiffs complaint under <em>Rule </em>4:6-2(e) should not have been denied by the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>Accordingly, the order of November 29, 2004 is reversed and plaintiffs complaint is dismissed with prejudice.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b141-12\"> Twenty-three states and the District of Columbia have adopted <em>Illinois Brick </em>repealer statutes: Alabama, <em>Ala.Code </em>\u00a7 6-5-60(a) 2005; Alaska, <em>Alaska Stat </em>\u00a7 45.50.577 (Michie 2004); California, <em>Cal.
