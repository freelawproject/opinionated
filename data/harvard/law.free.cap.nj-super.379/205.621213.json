The service of these subpoenas as well as service of subpoenas for documents upon various State agencies, including the Governor\u2019s Office, were widely reported in the news media, including newspapers published by plaintiff Gannett New Jersey Partners, L.P. See <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>Sandy McClure, \u201cFeds Subpoena State Offices,\u201d <em>Asbury Park Press, </em>Mar. 6, 2004, at Al; Sandy McClure, \u201cMore Data Released in Probe into Fund-raiser,\u201d <em>Asbury Park Press, </em>Mar. 25, 2004, at Al.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-4\">These newspaper stories indicated that the documents sought by the subpoenas related to a controversy between the Township of Piscataway and the Halper family regarding Piscataway\u2019s proposed condemnation of the Halpers\u2019 seventy-five-acre farm, called the Cornell Dairy Farm. See \u201cMore Data Released in Probe into Fund-raiser,\u201d <em>supra. </em>One story stated that Middlesex County had offered to contribute $4 million towards Piscataway\u2019s acquisition of the property. <em>Ibid. </em>This story indicated that the federal investigation focused on whether a Democratic fundraiser named David D\u2019Amiano had encouraged a Halper family member, Mark Halper, to make a $10,000 campaign contribution to the State Democratic Party in exchange for assistance from the McGreevey Administration in the family\u2019s efforts to retain ownership of the farm. <em>Ibid. </em>The story also reported that Mark Halper had made a direct appeal to Governor McGreevey for his help in retaining the farm in the Halper family. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">On March 18, 2004, Gannett sent an e-mail to Middlesex County requesting production under OPRA of the \u201cfederal subpoena[s] issued to the county and all information supplied to the U.S. Attorney or other federal authorities in response to the subpoenas.\u201d Middlesex County produced voluminous documents in response to this request. However, the County refused to produce copies of the federal subpoenas and certain other documents.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-6\">Gannett then filed this action in the Law Division to compel production under OPRA of the documents the County had refused to release. Gannett also sought production under the common law. The matter was brought before the trial court by an order to show cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-7\">Before the return date, the County submitted an index of the documents it had refused to produce together with a statement of its reasons for concluding that those documents are exempt from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>release under OPRA. The index indicated that the documents the County had not produced consisted of the federal subpoenas, telephone billing records of the County Administrator\u2019s Office, the Freeholder Director\u2019s computer index of addresses and telephone numbers, the County Counsel\u2019s and County Administrator\u2019s telephone message pad entries, County Counsel\u2019s appointment book, handwritten correspondence between County Counsel and his secretary, handwritten notes prepared by a county planner, Linda Busch, regarding certain meetings she had attended and letters to County Counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-6\">After reviewing these documents, the court concluded in an oral opinion that none of the documents listed in the index were required to be released under OPRA or the common law. Accordingly, the court entered final judgment dismissing Gannett\u2019s complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-7\">On appeal, Gannett argues that the federal subpoenas and other documents that the County refused to produce are public records that are not exempt from disclosure under any provision of OPRA. Gannett has abandoned its claims under the common law.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-8\">We conclude that OPRA does not require the County to release the subpoenas or the majority of other documents withheld from disclosure. However, the County has failed to show that Busch\u2019s handwritten notes or the letters to County Counsel are exempt from disclosure under OPRA. Accordingly, we affirm in part, reverse in part and remand to the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-9\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b243-10\">Preliminarily, we question whether Gannett\u2019s request for \u201call information supplied to the U.S. Attorney or other federal authorities\u201d in response to the grand jury subpoenas was a proper request for public records under OPRA. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>47:lA-5(f) provides in pertinent part that \u201c[t]he custodian of a public agency shall adopt a form for the use of any person who requests access to a government record held or controlled by the public agency,\u201d which \u201cshall provide space for ... a brief description of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>government record sought.\u201d Thus, OPRA requires a party requesting access to a public record to specifically describe the document sought. <em>See MAG Entm\u2019t, LLC v. Div. of Alcoholic Beverage Control, 375 N.J.Super. </em>534, 546-49, 868 A.2d 1067 (App.Div.2005). OPRA does not authorize a party to make a blanket request for every document a public agency has provided another party in-response to an OPRA request or, in this case, a federal grand jury subpoena. Such a request seeks access not merely to public records but also into the nature and scope of a third party\u2019s inquiry to a government agency.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">In addition to whatever interest a government agency may have in maintaining the confidentiality of its records, a party who requests access to public records also may have an interest in maintaining the confidentiality of its inquiry. This need for confidentiality is particularly strong when the party requesting the production of documents is a law enforcement agency such as the United States Attorney\u2019s Office. A United States Attorney\u2019s investigative inquiry through a grand jury subpoena is protected by federal law, <em>Fed.R.Crim.P. </em>6(e); <em>see United States v. Educ. Dev. Network Corp., </em>884 <em>F.2d </em>737, 740-41 (3d Cir.1989), <em>cert. denied, </em>494 <em>U.S. </em>1078, 110 <em>S.Ct. </em>1806, 108 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>937 (1990), and the release of documents the United States Attorney believes to be relevant to such an inquiry has the potential for interfering with a federal criminal investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">Moreover, the interest of third parties in protecting the confidentiality of their requests for access to public documents is not limited to law enforcement agencies. Suppose Gannett suspected that another news organization was conducting an investigation into a public agency\u2019s financial practices and had sought production of documents under OPRA in connection with that investigation. Could Gannett make a blanket request to the public agency for the production of all records provided to the other news organization?</p>\n<p id=\"b244-7\">But even assuming that Gannett\u2019s OPRA request was improper and that Middlesex County could have refused to produce any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>documents in response to that request, the County did not take that route but instead provided Gannett with most of the documents it had furnished to the United States Attorney\u2019s Office. Furthermore, when Gannett brought this action seeking disclosure of the remaining documents, the County did not defend on the ground that Gannett\u2019s OPRA request was improper but instead claimed that the withheld documents were confidential under OPRA and submitted a list of the withheld documents and the grounds for the County\u2019s confidentiality claims. Such a voluntary disclosure of most of the documents sought by Gannett and refusal to release the remaining documents solely on confidentiality grounds constituted a waiver of whatever right the County may have had to deny Gannett\u2019s entire OPRA request on the ground that it was improper. <em>See Mobil Oil Corp. v. U.S. Envtl. Prot. Agency, </em>879 F.2d 698, 700-02 (9th Cir.1989). Therefore, we consider the County\u2019s confidentiality claims with respect to each of the categories of withheld documents.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b245-7\">We first consider whether OPRA requires Middlesex County to provide Gannett with the federal grand jury subpoenas served upon County officials. There is no dispute that the subpoenas are \u201cgovernment record[s]\u201d under OPRA\u2019s expansive definition of this term, which includes not only documents \u201cmade, maintained or kept on file in the course of [a public agency\u2019s] official business,\u201d but also any document \u201creceived in the course of [the agency\u2019s] official business.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>47:1A-1.1. Since the subpoenas were received in the course of the agency\u2019s official business, they must be released to Gannett unless protected from disclosure by other provisions of OPRA.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-8\"><em>N.J.S.A. </em>47:lA-3 provides in pertinent part that \u201cwhere it shall appear that the record or records which are sought to be inspected, copied, or examined shall pertain to an investigation in progress by any public agency, the right of access provided [under OPRA] may be denied if the inspection, copying or examination of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>such record or records shall be inimical to the public interest.\u201d Although this section does not directly apply to a federal grand jury subpoena because the definition of \u201cpublic agency\u201d is limited to agencies of this State, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>47:1A-1.1, <em>N.J.S.A </em>47:lA-3 reflects a general legislative recognition of the public interest in law enforcement and other investigatory agencies maintaining the confidentiality of documents relevant to ongoing investigations. <em>See Loigman v. Kimmelman, </em>102 <em>N.J. </em>98, 106-08, 505 A.2d 958 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">Moreover, OPRA directs State custodians of public records to deny access to documents that are exempt from disclosure under federal law. <em>N.J.S.A </em>47:lA-5(a) provides that a custodian is not required to disclose \u201ca government record ... exempt from public access by ... any federal law,\u201d and <em>N.J.S.A. </em>47:lA-9 states that OPRA does not \u201cabrogate any exemption of a public record or government record from public access heretofore made pursuant to ... any federal law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b246-6\">The federal Freedom of Information Act, 5 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 552, provides that the disclosure requirements of that statute do not apply to \u201crecords or information compiled for law enforcement purposes, but only to the extent that the production of such law enforcement records or information ... could reasonably be expected to interfere with enforcement proceedings.\u201d 5 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 552(b)(7)(A). The purpose of this exemption is to prevent premature disclosure of investigatory materials that could be used in a federal law enforcement action. <em>FBI v. Abramson, </em>456 <em>U.S. </em>615, 621, 102 <em>S.Ct. </em>2054, 2059, 72 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>376, 383 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b246-7\">The party with the interest in maintaining the confidentiality of investigatory materials and the capacity to explain the need for that confidentiality is the investigatory agency, here the United States Attorney\u2019s Office, rather than the party in possession of the materials, here Middlesex County. However, the United States Attorney\u2019s Office was not provided with notice of Gannett\u2019s request to Middlesex County for production of the subpoenas or the complaint challenging the County\u2019s denial of access. Conse<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>quently, the United States Attorney\u2019s Office was deprived of the opportunity to assert the confidentiality of the grand jury subpoenas under 5 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 552(b)(7)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\"><em>N.J.S.A. </em>47:lA-5(g) generally places the burden upon the custodian of a public record to state the \u201cspecific basis\u201d for the denial of access, and <em>N.J.S.A. </em>47:IA-6 states that \u201c[t]he public agency shall have the burden of proving that the denial of access [to a document] is authorized by law.\u201d However, the custodian may not be in a position to discharge this burden if the asserted confidentiality interest in a document is not that of the government agency upon which the document request was made but rather another government agency, in this instance the United States Attorney\u2019s Office.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-7\">The exemption from disclosure provided by 5 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 552(b)(7)(A) is dependent upon a showing that \u201c(1) a law enforcement proceeding is pending or prospective and (2) release of the information could reasonably be expected to cause some articulable harm.\u201d <em>Manna v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>51 F.3d 1158, 1164 (3d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>516 <em>U.S. </em>975, 116 <em>S.Ct. </em>477, 133 L.Ed.2d 405 (1995). It is undisputed that a criminal investigation was pending when Gannett requested Middlesex County to release copies of the grand jury subpoenas served by the United States Attorney\u2019s Office. However, the custodian for public records for Middlesex County was not in a position to know whether the release of those subpoenas \u201ccould reasonably be expected to cause some articulable harm\u201d to that criminal investigation. <em>Ibid. </em>Only the United States Attorney\u2019s Office would have that knowledge, and it was not made a party or even given notice of Gannett\u2019s action to compel release of the subpoenas. Under these circumstances, we conclude that in order to preserve the confidentiality interests of federal law enforcement agencies protected by 5 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 552(b)(7)(A), a court should presume that the release of the grand jury subpoenas could interfere with the federal criminal investigation and uphold a denial of access under OPRA.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>III</p>\n<p id=\"b248-4\">We next consider whether OPRA requires the disclosure of the County Administrator\u2019s telephone billing, records. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>47:lA-9(b) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-5\"><em>The provisions of [OPRA] shall not abrogate or erode any </em>executive or legislative privilege or <em>grant of confidentiality heretofore established or recognized by </em>the Constitution of this State, statute, court rule or <em>judicial case law, </em>which privilege or grant of confidentiality may duly be claimed to restrict public access to a public record or government record.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-6\">[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b248-7\">In <em>North Jersey Newspapers Co. v. Passaic County Bd. of Chosen Freeholders, </em>127 <em>N.J. </em>9, 601 A.2d 693 (1992), the Court held that there was no right of public access to telephone billing records under the Right to Know Law, which was the predecessor to OPRA. In reaching this conclusion, the Court noted the strong interest of both public officials and persons with whom they communicate by telephone in maintaining the confidentiality of those communications:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-8\">One problem with unrestricted access to the telephone numbers called is the disclosure not only of the record of the public official\u2019s calls but, inferentially, the identity of those who have called the official. Phone calls made to the public official\u2019s office will usually be returned</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-9\">In addition, there may be times-and they may be the most critical times-when a government official will have to make a telephone call that has an arguable claim to confidentiality-times when, for example, a mayor might need to call a city council member from an opposing political party on a most highly sensitive community issue to enlist that person\u2019s support; or times when a mayor might need to call a community activist to calm troubled waters, without causing disruption that might result from appearing to negotiate with a dissident who may, at the moment, be perceived as a lawbreaker____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-10\">... [A] person\u2019s privacy interest includes \u201cthe people and places one calls on a telephone, no less than the resulting conversations.\u201d Thus, a person\u2019s expectation of privacy extends to telephone toll-billing records.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-11\">[Id. at 16-18, 601 A.2d 693 (citations omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b248-12\"><em>North Jersey Newspapers </em>constitutes \u201cjudicial ease law\u201d that \u201cestablished or recognized\u201d the \u201cconfidentiality\u201d of telephone bill<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>ing records before enactment of OPRA within the intent of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>47:lA-9(b). Therefore, we affirm the trial court\u2019s denial of access to those records.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">There is an additional reason why OPRA does not compel disclosure of the County Administrator\u2019s telephone billing records. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>47:1A-1.1 provides in pertinent part that the term \u201cgovernment record\u201d does not include the \u201cportion of any document which discloses the ... unlisted telephone number ... of any person[,]\u201d and <em>N.J.S.A. </em>47:lA-5(g) provides that a request for access to a government document may be denied on the ground that it \u201cwould substantially disrupt agency operations.\u201d The voluminous telephone billing records sought by Gannett, which cover a twelve-month period, undoubtedly include unlisted telephone numbers, and there is no indication that there is any reasonably practical method of culling out those numbers from the rest of the numbers in the records.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b249-7\">Gannett also challenges the County\u2019s denial of access to the Freeholder Director\u2019s computer index of addresses and telephone numbers, the telephone message pad entries of the County Counsel and County Administrator and County Counsel\u2019s appointment book. The Freeholder Director\u2019s index of addresses and telephone numbers and the telephone message pad entries contain the same type of information the Court in <em>North Jersey Newspapers </em>found to be protected by an expectation of privacy \u2014 the identities and telephone numbers of persons who call and are called by public officials. <em>See </em>127 <em>N.J. </em>at 16-18, 601 A.2d 693. Therefore, the trial court correctly concluded that those documents are not subject to public access under OPRA.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-8\">Although County Counsel\u2019s appointment book does not contain telephone numbers, it reveals the identity of persons with whom County Counsel planned to meet and the purpose of the meetings. Such information implicates privacy interests of persons who meet with public officials similar to the identity of persons who call and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>are called by public officials. Consequently, we conclude that the rationale of <em>North Jersey Newspapers </em>extends to the information contained in County Counsel\u2019s appointment book.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b250-6\">We next consider whether OPRA requires the disclosure of County Counsel\u2019s note to his secretary and her response relating to a pending condemnation action in which the County agreed to provide part of the funding for the acquisition and was appearing as amicus curiae. The Rules of Court extend broad protection from disclosure to attorney work product relating to litigation. <em>Rule </em>4:10-2(c) provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-7\">In ordering discovery ... the court shall protect against disclosure of the mental impressions, conclusions, opinions, or legal theories of an attorney or other representative of a party concerning the litigation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b250-8\"><em>N.J.S.A </em>47:lA-9(b) provides in pertinent part that \u201c[t]he provisions of [OPRA] shall not abrogate or erode any ... grant of confidentiality ... recognized by ... court rule.\u201d Consequently, if a document is protected work product under <em>Rule </em>4:10-2(c), it is also protected from disclosure under OPRA.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-9\">An amicus curiae is not considered a party to litigation for some purposes, such as the right to raise issues that have not been raised by a party, <em>Bethlehem Township Bd. of Educ. v. Bethlehem Township Educ. Ass\u2019n, </em>91 <em>N.J. </em>38, 48-49, 449 A.2d 1254 (1982). However, the communications between an amicus curiae and its attorney are protected by the attorney-client privilege just as any other communication between an attorney and client, <em>N.J.R.E. </em>504, and the work-product privilege may be invoked in some circumstances by an attorney who does not represent a named party to an action. <em>See United Coal Cos. v. Powell Constr. Co., </em>839 A.2d 958, 966 (3d Cir.1988). In this case, Middlesex County has a direct interest in the pending condemnation action, comparable to the municipal condemnor, because it has agreed to fund a substantial portion of the cost of acquisition. Consequently, we conclude that County Counsel should be treated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>as an attorney for a party and was entitled to assert the work-product privilege as a basis for refusing to disclose documents relating to the condemnation action. We also are satisfied based on our review of the documents that County Counsel\u2019s note to his secretary and her response to him qualify as attorney work product.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-6\">VI</p>\n<p id=\"b251-7\">The County refused to release the handwritten notes of Linda Busch, a principal planner in the County Planning Department, regarding the possible entry into the Farmland Preservation Program of the Cornell Dairy Farm on the ground that those notes fall within the exemption from disclosure provided by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>47:1A-1.1 for \u201cinter-agency or intra-agency advisory, consultative or deliberative material.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b251-8\">The exemption from disclosure provided by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>47:1A-1.1, which is often referred to as the deliberative process privilege, <em>see In re Readoption with Amendments of Death Penalty Regulations N.J.A.C. 10A:23, by the N.J. Dep\u2019t of Carr., </em>367 <em>N.J.Super. </em>61, 73-74, 842 A.2d 207 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>182 <em>N.J. </em>149, 862 A.2d 57 (2004), is aimed at protecting the quality of government decisions by shielding the communications received by a decision maker from public disclosure, <em>NLRB v. Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co., </em>421 <em>U.S. </em>132, 151, 95 <em>S.Ct. </em>1504, <em>1516-17, 44 L.Ed.2d </em>29, 47-48 (1975). To qualify for this privilege, two conditions must be satisfied: (1) the document must be predecisional, meaning it was \u201cgenerated before the adoption of an agency\u2019s policy or decision,\u201d and (2) it \u201cmust be deliberative in nature, containing opinions, recommendations, or advice about agency policies.\u201d <em>In re the Liquidation of Integrity Ins. Co., </em>165 <em>N.J. </em>75, 84-85, 754 A.2d 1177 (2000). The privilege does not extend to \u201c[p]urely factual material that does not reflect deliberative processes.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 85, 754 A.2d 1177. Therefore, if a document contains both deliberative and factual materials, the deliberative materials must be redacted and the factual materials disclosed. <em>See id. </em>at 87, 754 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>A.2d 1177 (quoting <em>McClain v. Coll. Hosp., </em>99 <em>N.J. </em>346, 363, 492 A.2d 991 (1985)); <em>see also Schreiber v. Soc. for Sav. Bancorp., Inc., </em>11 F.3d 217, 220-21 (D.C.Cir.1993). Although <em>Integrity Insurance </em>did not involve the interpretation of OPRA, we are satisfied that the deliberative process exemption incorporated in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>47:1A-1.1 adopts the principles set forth in that opinion. <em>See In re Readoption with Amendments of Death Penalty Regulations, N.J.AC. 10A:23, supra, </em>367 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 73-75, 842 A.2d 207.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">Ms. Busch\u2019s thirteen pages of handwritten notes contain primarily factual material, in particular her record of conversations with the Halpers and their representatives. However, there are a number of entries within her notes that appear deliberative in nature, in particular her tentative views concerning the course of action the County should follow in connection with the acquisition of the Halpers\u2019 property. Therefore, the trial court should have redacted the deliberative entries in Busch\u2019s notes and then released the notes with those redactions to Gannett. Moreover, if the court had a question whether any factual materials in the notes reflect deliberative processes, it should have conducted an appropriate <em>in camera </em>hearing. <em>See Hartz Mountain Indus., Inc. v. N.J. Sports &amp; Exposition Auth., </em>369 <em>N.J.Super. </em>175, 183, 848 A.2d 793 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>182 <em>N.J. </em>147, 862 A.2d 56 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b252-6\">The trial court failed to follow these procedures and instead erroneously concluded that all of Busch\u2019s notes were deliberative in nature and consequently exempt from disclosure. Accordingly, we reverse the part of the judgment that sustained the County\u2019s refusal to release those notes and remand this part of the case for reconsideration in accordance with our opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-7\">VII</p>\n<p id=\"b252-8\">Finally, we consider whether OPRA requires Middlesex County to provide Gannett access to two letters to its County Counsel, one from the attorney for the defendants in the condemnation action transmitting an application to the Farmland Preser<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>vation Program and the other a handwritten note from David D\u2019Amiano enclosing a memorandum from Mark Halper indicating the amount that the Halper family was seeking for transfer development rights to its property. The County provided the following explanation for denying Gannett access to these letters: \u201cExemption is claimed under Attorney-client privilege <em>(N.J.S.A. </em>47A:1A-1.1) settlement discussions of actively litigated matter.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">The two letters are not protected by the attorney-client privilege. This privilege extends only to confidential communications between an attorney and client. <em>See N.J.R.E. </em>504(1); <em>State v. Schubert, </em>235 <em>N.J.Super. </em>212, 220, 561 A.2d 1186 (App.Div.1989), <em>certif. denied, </em>121 <em>N.J. </em>597, 583 A.2d 302, <em>cert. denied, </em>496 <em>U.S. </em>911, 110 <em>S.Ct. </em>2600, 110 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>280 (1990). The letters are not from any client of County Counsel but rather from third parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-7\">The letter from the attorney for the defendants in the condemnation action transmitting their application to the Farmland Preservation Program is also plainly not inadmissible under <em>N.J.R.E. </em>408 as a \u201cstatement! ] ... in settlement negotiations\u201d because the letter does not contain any \u201coffer!] of compromise\u201d or other statement related to settlement of the condemnation action. The handwritten note from David D\u2019Amiano would not be inadmissible under <em>N.J.R.E. </em>408 because the rule only applies to statements relating to settlement by a party or the party\u2019s attorney, and D\u2019Amiano was neither a party to the condemnation action nor an attorney to a party. Although the memorandum from Mark Halper attached to that letter reflects the Halper family\u2019s view of the value of development rights to the property, it is not a settlement offer. Therefore, that memorandum probably would not be inadmissible under <em>N.J.R.E. </em>408. Under these circumstances, we conclude that even if a settlement offer would be exempt from disclosure under OPRA in some circumstances, the County has failed to establish adequate grounds for denial of access to either letter.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-8\">Accordingly, we reverse the part of the final judgment that upheld the County\u2019s refusal to release Linda Busch\u2019s handwritten <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>notes and the two letters to County Counsel. We remand the case to the trial court to determine which entries in Busch\u2019s notes are deliberative materials that should be redacted. The judgment is affirmed in all other respects.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
