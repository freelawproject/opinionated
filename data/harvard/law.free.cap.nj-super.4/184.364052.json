J. A. D.</author>\n<p id=\"A4q\">Plaintiffs, tenants in an apartment house located in Newark, New Jersey, instituted their action against the defendants, as owners thereof, to recover for injuries resulting from alleged negligence in the maintenance of the common hallway at the entrance to their apartment. The defendants denied the allegation of negligence and asserted that the plaintiffs had assumed the risk resulting from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>the condition of the hallway and were contributorily negligent. At the close of the plaintiffs\u2019 case, the trial court granted a motion for dismissal and this appeal is from the ensuing judgment for the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-4\">The testimony of the plaintiff Mrs. Dorothy Kahn indicated that on September 13, 1946, as she was about to enter her apartment door, located in a tiled recess off the common hallway, her foot caught in a depression near the right corner of the doorway at the juncture between the tile and the saddle under her apartment door, and, as a result, she fell and was injured. Mr. Sheffield, a licensed construction engineer, testified for plaintiffs that the depression was about three-eighths of an inch in depth and that there was a similar depression near the left corner of the doorway. He found no evidence that the tile had been cracked or chipped and concluded that the depression occurred in the course of original construction and constituted substandard or defective construction. Mrs. Kahn\u2019s husband, plaintiff Ben Kahn, testified that he had noticed the depression before the accident but never considered it a place of hazard. Their son Jack testified that he had observed the depression and that it was not obscure but Mrs. Kahn testified that she never noticed it before the accident. The Kahns had occupied the apartment for about two and one-half years.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\"> In <em>Ball v. Atlantic City Ambassador Hotel Corp., </em>137 <em>N. J. L. </em>744, 57 <em>A. </em>2d 362 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1948), the Court of Errors and Appeals recently had occasion to collect and discuss the cases dealing with accidents allegedly resulting, as here, from' substandard construction of the premises. The court there pointed out that the issue of liability is peculiarly dependent upon the facts of each case and that in those cases where recovery was sustained, \u201cthe structural defect was dangerous or there existed some factor which constituted negligence.\u201d We find nothing in the plaintiffs\u2019 evidence which would permit reasonable men to conclude that the defendants had been causally negligent or that the slight depression at the juncture of the tile and door saddle was, in itself, dangerous to plaintiffs. Its inherent nature did not establish <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>such danger and nothing in the testimony of plaintiffs\u2019 expert witness justified any pertinent inference beyond the fact that the construction was below accepted standards. Similarly, there was nothing in the testimony of Mr. and Mrs. Kahn and their son, beyond the mere happening of the accident, which introduced any factors of negligence on the defendants\u2019 part or established that \u201cthe deviation from the standard resulted in an unsafe and dangerous condition.\u201d See <em>Kelly v. </em>Loft, Inc., 124 <em>N. J. L. </em>185, 186 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1940).</p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">We have concluded that the motion for dismissal at the close of the plaintiffs\u2019 ease was properly granted and the judgment entered below is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
