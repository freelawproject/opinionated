A. D.</author>\n<p id=\"AIG\">This appeal brings up a judgment in favor of defendant entered on the direction of the court at the close of the entire case. At that point the evidence disclosed that the plaintiff, Catherine T. McGovern, was walking north on the east side of Illinois Avenue in Atlantic City. When she was opposite the Park Lane Apartments, she stepped from the curb, intending to cross to the west side of Illinois Avenue. There was a parked car about eight feet to her left, another car parked about twelve feet to her right, both headed north. It was a dark night and when she was three or three and a half feet from the curb she stopped, looked to her left and saw a truck coming from the south about two hundred feet distant. She then drew closer the dog which she had on a leash, made an observation to the north, heard brakes, glanced to her left, saw a triick coming at a moderate speed in \u201cthe line of traffic\u201d and was struck. The truck was proceeding \u201cin a straight line.\u201d A witness, Loretta McCullough, hearing a commotion looked from the balcony of her apartment and \u201csaw a taxicab and the truck in the middle of the street, in the traffic lane in the street, and the taxic.ab was backing up towards Fischer\u2019s truck.\u201d She heard Mrs. McGovern say \u201cthe truck hit me.\u201d Another witness testified that she saw a truck \u201cin front of the parking <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>place in front of the Park Lane Apartments * * <em>* </em>facing toward Pacific Avenue.\u201d The driver of the defendant\u2019s truck testified that he \u201cwas in the middle of the street coming down slow, and just before I hit the Park Lane Apartments a fellow stepped out and threw up his hands and asked me to stop. When I stopped he said, \u2018Give me a hand with the lady under this car.\u2019 \u201d When he came to a stop he was \u201cdirectly in the middle of the street.\u201d There was additional testimony, none of which threw any light upon the happening of the accident, and we therefore omit a summary thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-6\">Viewing the evidence in its most favorable light to plaintiff and giving her the benefit of all reasonable inferences that may be drawn therefrom, we find no evidence that would justify submission of the case to the jury. The evidence places the plaintiff three and a half feet out in the street, closer to the curb than the outside of the parked cars; it places the truck in the middle of the street proceeding in a straight line. Under the evidence presented, a finding of negligence upon the part of the driver of the defendant\u2019s truck would be based upon sheer speculation.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
