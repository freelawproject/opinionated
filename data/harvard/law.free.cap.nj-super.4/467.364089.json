A. D.</author>\n<p id=\"AEqn\">The question for determination is whether the Commissioner of Motor Vehicles (now\" Director, Division of Motor Vehicles) lawfully revoked, without hearing. plaintiff\u2019s license to operate a motor vehicle in the State of New Jersey.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-12\">The ease w-as tried before the Essex County Law Division of the Superior Court without a jury and on a stipulation of facts. This appeal stems from the affirmance by the Superior Court of the Commissioner\u2019s revocation of plaintiff\u2019s driver\u2019s license.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-13\">Plaintiff was convicted, of operating an automobile while under the influence of intoxicating liquor in violation of the motor vehicle law-s of the State of Maryland and his privilege to operate a motor vehicle in that State was suspended indefinitely. Defendant, under authority of <em>R. S. </em>39:5-30, upon receipt from the Commissioner of Motor Vehicles of the State of Maryland of the record of plaintiff\u2019s conviction, revoked plaintiff\u2019s license to operate a motor vehicle in New <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>Jersey, first having given written notice to plaintiff of such proposed .revocation and the ground thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-4\">Plaintiff urges three grounds for the reversal of the judgment of the Superior Court, viz.: that (1) the action of the Commissioner was invalid because of the Commissioner\u2019s failure to grant him a hearing prior to the revocation of his license; that (3) his conviction in Maryland was \u201cobtained by fraud\u201d and \u201cis a nullity;\u201d that (3) his conviction in Maryland was not within the purview of <em>R. S. </em>39:5-30 as constituting \u201cother reasonable grounds\u201d authorizing the Commissioner to revoke his license. We find no merit in these contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">The pertinent portion of <em>R. S. </em>39:5-30 (as amended <em>P. L. </em>1945, c. 256, <em>p. </em>782, \u00a7 1) reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-6\">\u201cEvery registration certificate and every license certificate to drive motor vehicles may be suspended or revolted, and any person may be prohibited from obtaining a driver\u2019s license or a registration certificate, and the reciprocity privilege of any nonresident may be suspended or revoked by the commissioner for a violation of any of the provisions of this Title or on any other reasonable grounds, after-due notice in writing of such proposed suspension, revocation or prohibition and the ground thereof.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b502-7\"> Under <em>R. S. </em>39:5-30, it is also provided that the Commissioner <em>may </em>hold a hearing \u201clooking toward a revocation of a license or registration certificate issued by or under his authority.\u201d Plaintiff, in seeking a hearing before the Commissioner, was obviously attempting to get an opportunity to try out the issue of his guilt or innoeenc\u00e9 of the Maryland charge. His lack of prudence and diligence in meeting that issue in the foreign jurisdiction precipitated the predicament with which he has been faced by the action of the Commissioner. It is clear that the pertinent language of the statute grants the Commissioner discretionary authority as to whether he will conduct such a hearing. Unless it appears that the Commissioner abused his discretion, a revocation or suspension of license will not be set aside on that ground. Under the circumstances prevailing here, we are of the opinion that the Commissioner was not chargeable with any abuse of discretion in refusing to grant plaintiff a hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>Plaintiff\u2019s contention that the conviction in the State of Maryland was \u201cobtained by fraud\u201d and \u201cThe judgment * * * is a nullity,\u201d is not supported by the record. In fact, it is entirely barren of any persuasive proof tending to establish any infirmity in the judgment. By consent of counsel, we have examined the certificate of the Maryland conviction which was the basis of the Commissioner\u2019s revocation of plaintiff\u2019s New Jersey license. We are satisfied that it evidences a valid conviction not only for operating a motor vehicle under the influence of intoxicating liquor, but also for \u201creckless driving.\u201d His deliberate failure to appear at a hearing scheduled the day following his arrest in Maryland, his failure to take an appeal from the judgment of conviction and having instituted no proceedings to test the validity thereof, plaintiff cannot successfully assert its invalidity here.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-7\">We are satisfied that plaintiff\u2019s conviction in Maryland is reasonably comprehended within the term \u201cother reasonable grounds\u201d <em>(R. S. </em>39:5-30) justifying defendant\u2019s revocation of plaintiff\u2019s New Jersey license. Upon conviction of a person for operating an automobile while under the influence of intoxicating liquor over the highways of this State, his right to operate a motor vehicle is forfeited for a period of two years. <em>R. S. </em>39:4-50. It reasonably follows that one holding a New Jersey driver\u2019s license, upon proof of a conviction for that offense in another state, should not be permitted to continue to operate a motor vehicle in New Jersey. In the case of <em>Hinnekens v. </em>Magee, 135 <em>N. J. L. </em>537 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1947), while the factual situation is not analogous to the case <em>sub judice, </em>the court indicated its approval of the authority of the Commissioner to revoke a New Jersey driver\u2019s license upon proof of his conviction for operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor in another state.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-8\">We are convinced that plaintiff\u2019s conviction in Maryland was a sufficiently valid and reasonable ground as to have justified the defendant in revoking his New Jersey driver\u2019s license.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-9\">The judgment of the Superior Court is affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
