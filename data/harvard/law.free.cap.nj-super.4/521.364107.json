The dismissal was based upon the grounds (1) that there was no evidence that defendant was negligent and <em>(2) </em>that plaintiff was guilty of contributory negligence as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-9\">We think the action of the trial court was erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-10\">Plaintiff\u2019s testimony, was to the effect that she, a passenger in defendant\u2019s trolley, sought to alight therefrom and that, although the door was open fox her exit, the step remained in an upright position, as a result of which she fell, to the street and was injured. Defendant\u2019s contention, that plaintiff\u2019s testimony did not amount to a statement that the step was in an upright position before she fell, is not sustained by a fair reading of the record. The evidence was sufficient to preclude a dismissal. <em>Whalen v. Consolidated Traction </em>Co., 61 <em>N. J. L. </em>606 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1898).</p>\n<p id=\"b554-11\">Defendant argues that, since plaintiff testified that she made no observation before-alighting, she was guilty of contributory negligence. Her first observation was apparently made after she had committed herself to a forward motion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>out of the vehicle. It cannot be said as a matter of law that plaintiff was contributorily negligent in assuming that the step was in the position in which it should have been.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\">Judgment is reversed and the cause is remanded for retrial.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
