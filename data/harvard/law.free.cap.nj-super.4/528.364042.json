Brennan, Jr., J. S. C.</author>\n<p id=\"ArlD\">This appeal challenges the concurring findings of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Bureau and the Hudson County Court that appellant Liberty Mutual Insurance Company is liable to pay an award for disability due to chrome exposure. The award itself is not challenged. The issues are whether the disability occurred during the period of appellant\u2019s coverage and, if it did, whether the claim is compensable by appellant inasmuch \u25a0as the employee continued the exposure after appellant\u2019s coverage terminated.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-6\">The employee was first employed February 18, 1942, while appellant insured the risk and except for four months starting July 11, 1946, was continuously employed and exposed to chrome to and including the Bureau hearings on January 8, and 29, 1948. Appellant\u2019s policy expired November 28, 1946, and thereafter successive policies of respondent Hartford, from November 29, 1946, to January 8, 1947, and of respondent Employers\u2019 Mutual, after January 8, 1947, covered the risk.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-7\"> The Bureau and the County Court found that the disability due to chrome poisoning occurred during January, 1946, in the period of appellant\u2019s coverage. There is ample evidence in the testimony to support this conclusion, and we shall not disturb it. \u2019 It is true that frequently in cases of this kind some clearly defined event, a medically advised or compulsory quitting or change of work because of inability to endure further exposure serves to establish the disability date. <em>Textileather Corp. v. Great American Indemnity Co., </em>108 <em>N. J. L. </em>121 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1931); <em>Natural Products Refining Co. v. Court of Common Pleas in and for Hudson County, </em>123 <em>N. J. L. </em>522; affirmed, 125 <em>N. J. L. </em>309 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1940). But as was observed in <em>Koval v. Natural Products Refining Co., </em>25 <em>N. J. Misc. </em>489 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1947), this is when the evidence is \u201clacking proof as to when the progress of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>disease was arrested and the condition became chronic.\u201d The proof is abundant in this case as to the actual time disability ensued.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">Appellant insists that if disability did occur during its policy coverage the employee continued his exposure to chrome after its policy terminated and is barred by <em>R. S. </em>34:15-34, <em>N. J. S. A., </em>from filing a claim <em>until </em>within one year from the last <em>injurious </em>exposure. That statute unlike the Asbestosis and Silicosis Act, <em>R. S. </em>34:15-35.1 <em>et seq., N. J. S. A., </em>makes no reference to <em>injurious </em>exposure. It bars claims not filed \u201cwithin one year after the date on which the employee <em>ceased to be exposed </em>\u2014 to such occupational disease.\u201d The County Court correctly held \u201cthat while the statute fixes the uttermost limit of delay in the filing of a compensation claim after the cessation of exposure, it sets no restriction upon timeliness, <em>i. e., </em>upon the filing <em>before </em>the claimant has ceased to be exposed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b563-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
