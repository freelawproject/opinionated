In his <em>pro se </em>complaint under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, Thornton alleged that the Alabama Correctional Incentive Time Act (ACITA), Ala.Code \u00a7 14-9-41(e), violated the equal protection clause and the due process clause of the United States Constitution. The district court adopted the magistrate\u2019s recommendation that the complaint be dismissed because ACITA, which denies \u201cgood time\u201d accumulation for prisoners sentenced to more than ten years, was rationally related to the goal of controlling the early release or parole of serious offenders.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-11\">Thornton\u2019s complaint challenged ACITA\u2019s classification of prisoners sentenced to more than ten years. The statute does not single out a suspect class or impinge on a fundamental right. Thus, the provision is subject to the rational basis test under the equal protection clause. <em>See Hodel v. Indiana, </em>452 U.S. 314, 331, 101 S.Ct. 2376, 2386-87, 69 L.Ed.2d 40 (1981). ACITA\u2019s classification of prisoners serving sentences of more than ten years is rationally related to the legitimate purpose of preventing the early release of serious offenders. Therefore, the statute does not violate the equal protection clause or the due process clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-13\">The judgment of the district court is</p>\n<p id=\"b625-14\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
