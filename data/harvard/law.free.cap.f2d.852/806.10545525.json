The district court, on the basis of a magistrate\u2019s hearing and recommendation, denied all relief. We previously affirmed that judgment. 845 F.2d 566 (5th Cir.1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b905-26\">At that time we raised, <em>sua sponte, </em>the possible propriety of sanctions for frivolous appeal pursuant to Fed.R.App.P. 38 and gave Coghlan\u2019s <em>attorney an </em>opportunity to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"808\">*808</page-number>show cause why sanctions should not be imposed. Counsel\u2019s memorandum, setting forth his position on the assessment of sanctions, has been considered, but it argues little against the propriety of sanctions for appeal in a case in which, as here, there was no reasonable, good-faith argument advanced for the extension, modification, or reversal of precedent clearly elaborated by the opinion below. Instead, Cogh-lan\u2019s attorney cites us to numerous out-of-circuit cases where more egregious appellate conduct was sanctioned, reminding us that this appeal was taken in subjective good-faith and in the earnest hope that we would draw conclusions, from the nearly undisputed facts, different from those reached by the magistrate in accordance with clear precedent. Such a response not only fails to explain why this appeal should not be considered frivolous, but underscores that counsel must have pursued this litigation without any reasonable basis for belief that Coghlan\u2019s constitutional claims would prevail on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-4\">We accept counsel\u2019s admonition that it was he and not his indigent client who decided to prosecute this case further. After review of the memorandum and affidavit filed by appellee Waterworks District, setting forth the time and expense incurred by it in responding to this frivolous appeal, we find $1,350.00, the amount submitted by appellee\u2019s counsel, to be a reasonable attorneys\u2019 charge for its appellate defense, based upon the reasonable hourly fee of $75. Accordingly, we ORDER appellant\u2019s counsel personally to pay such sum over to appellee, in addition to the costs normally taxable against the nonprevailing party. Coghlan shall remain ultimately liable only for said single costs, but she and her attorney may apportion this routine award between themselves as they see fit.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-5\">I. OUR PURPOSE.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-6\">In this case, unlike some of the others cited, the appellee did not move for sanctions on appeal, or, for that matter, in the district court; nonetheless, there is no question that the courts of appeals have the ability to impose sanctions <em>sua </em>sponte.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Appellant seems to argue that an imposition <em>sua sponte </em>of sanctions upon a finding that an appeal was frivolous \u201cought to be severely limited to extraordinary cases\u201d in which delay, harassment, obstinancy, or other improper purpose aggravates the unreasonableness of taking the appeal. While some cases have relied upon such evidence of bad faith, ill purpose is in no way a necessary element for imposition of sanctions under rule 38. And while rule 38 sanctions are often imposed, especially in tax cases, after the litigant had been sanctioned below for frivolous conduct, the district court does not need to have imposed sanctions, or explicitly denominated the case as frivolous, for the court of appeals to find that the appeal was frivolous and without merit. \u201cThat the district court did not find appellant\u2019s charges so redundant and frivolous as to warrant sanctions does not preclude a contrary decision on appeal.\u201d <em>Freeze v. Griffith, </em>849 F.2d 172, 176, (5th Cir.1988) (sanctions against pro se prisoner pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)) <em>(citing Lay v. Anderson, </em>837 F.2d 231, 232 (5th Cir.1988)). Similarly, an appellant does not have to conduct the appeal in a manner sanctioned in other cases in order for us to view the appeal as necessarily lacking plausible argument following a clean disposition of the relevant issues by the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-13\">Counsel continually argues, in explanation of his pursuit of Coghlan\u2019s baseless claim, that he believed in good faith that recitation of the facts ought easily to have led us to a conclusion diametrically opposed to that reached by the magistrate. Thus, Coghlan\u2019s attorney asserts that \u201c[i]n other words, the magistrate should have found under the facts that Coghlan possessed a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"809\">*809</page-number>constitutionally protected property interest to receive water service,\u201d and that this appellate panel \u201cshould\u201d more readily have disregarded the controlling case law to substantiate such a \u201ccompelling\u201d claim. In part, Coghlan\u2019s counsel responds to our show cause notice as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b907-4\">Argument could be made without extensive citation of authority. Counsel\u2019s brief therefore contained the argument that the magistrate\u2019s conclusion was incorrect, based upon the very facts found by the magistrate and based upon the very law the magistrate cited.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b907-5\">Somehow, the three judge panel of this court to which this case was allotted rejected what counsel in good faith believed to be a strong contention that Coghlan was a consumer/customer of the Waterworks District and possessed a constitutionally protected property interest. The panel affirmed the magistrate in [a] seven page opinion....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b907-6\">Somehow, also the three judge panel of this court found Coghlan\u2019s claim was unfounded. This court, therefore, in effect determined Coghlan abused her right of appeal.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b907-7\">However, it is not Coghlan\u2019s right to appeal the judgment against her that is at issue; rather, the point is that her entirely \u201cfrivolous\u201d appeal is an unjustified consumption of appellate resources, which, \u201cin addition, has put the appellee to heavy expense required to analyze the record, brief the issues and argue the case.\u201d <em>Bank of Canton, Ltd. v. Republic Nat\u2019l Bank, </em>636 F.2d 30, 31 (2d Cir.1980). In contemplating sanctions for an appellate brief that fails to argue any case law, makes hardly any attempt to distinguish precedents relied upon below, argues the merits in the most con-elusory fashion, and offers no independent legal analysis different from that decisively rejected by the district court, we follow the identical course we established in other cases.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In this regard, another circuit recently commented:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ADq\">It is human nature to crave vindication of a passionately held position even if the position lacks an objectively reasonable basis in the law. Although we have no reason to believe that the company or its counsel was acting in bad faith, ... the company\u2019s briefs and oral argument failed to identify any arguable error in the district court\u2019s decision.... We have gone on at such length not because the question of the validity of the arbitrator\u2019s award is difficult but to make clear that the company\u2019s attack on the award was frivolous, thus entitling the union to attorney\u2019s fees.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b907-11\"><em>Dreis &amp; Krump Mfg. Co. v. Int\u2019l Ass\u2019n of Machinists, </em>802 F.2d 247, 255-56 (7th Cir.1986).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b907-12\">The purpose of this lengthy review of current sanctions eases is to elaborate clearly for counsel herein, and for all prac-tioners, that there can be little tolerance for unmerited appeals without articulable support in the law. Appeal as of right does not translate into propriety of appeal when counsel can make no reasonable argument for extension, modification, or reversal of precedent clearly elaborated by the district court opinion. Another circuit court of appeals recently took the time to readdress a rule 38 award it had imposed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AHz\">When the appellant files an appeal, he asks for this court\u2019s attention. [T]he notion that an appellant has an untram-melled right of review cannot shift the burden of going forward to the appel-lee.... Appellee should not be forced to endure the expense and anxiety of waiting unnecessarily to have its dispute resolved. With so many worthy claims waiting to be resolved, we cannot tolerate unfounded and undeveloped claims [to clog our docket and consume appellate time and resources],</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AbC\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"810\">*810</page-number><em>Reliance Ins. Co. v. Sweeney Corp., </em>792 F.2d 1137, 1139 (D.C.Cir.1986) (per curiam) (in opinion affirming summary judgment, panel <em>sua sponte </em>ordered appellant and its attorney to show cause why sanctions should not be imposed; appellant filed no response and, based upon affidavit of ap-pellee, $5220.00 was awarded).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b908-4\">II. THE PURPOSE OF RULE 38.</p>\n<p id=\"A6bWn\">The magistrate\u2019s decision dispelled any claim that there was a colorable constitutional deprivation. Disregarding the magistrate^ recommendation that each party bear its own costs, the district court ordered Coghlan to pay the Waterworks District\u2019s taxable expenses. Because of the totally unfounded nature of the constitutional claim here advanced, the district court was entirely justified in imposing costs upon the plaintiff. That action alone should have suggested to Coghlan that her claim was more than merely meritless \u2014 the law was and is well settled that the claim was unsupportable and unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-5\">However, assertedly having reviewed the judgment against Coghlan and examining the case law, her attorney on appeal agreed to bring the case to this court. With what independent judgment he determined that success on the facts could be obtained totally evades our imagination; no attorney who made a diligent inquiry into the state of the law when this appeal was taken could have thought the suit had any possible merit.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Nonetheless, he filed notice of appeal and prepared the brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-10\">Though novel constitutional theories should not be chilled, costs and attorneys\u2019 fees are merited for a frivolous appeal the result of which is obvious from the comprehensive and decisive exposition of the law by the judge below.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> With respect to a factually and legally frivolous <em>pro se </em>usury, fraud, and RICO complaint sanctioned by the district court under Fed.R.Civ.P. 11 and on appeal under rule 38, we recently commented that, even when constitutional violations are not alleged,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b908-11\">[tjhis court has no desire to deter any litigant from advancing any claim or defense which is arguably supported by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"811\">*811</page-number>existing law, or any reasonably based suggestion for its extension, modification, or reversal. Positions thus taken cannot be considered as frivolous, although they may be unsuccessful and indeed may be given short shrift. But claims outside of this broad umbrella may prove frivolous.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AP7\"><em>Farguson v. MBank Houston, N.A., </em>808 F.2d 358, 359 (5th Cir.1986).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"A5H\"> An appeal is frivolous if the re-suit is obvious or the arguments of error are wholly without merit. <em>See, e.g., Atwood v. Union Carbide Corp., </em>847 F.2d 278, (5th Cir.1988) (partial attorneys\u2019 fees for frivolous appeal).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Appeal here was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"812\">*812</page-number>patently frivolous, even if the original suit, <em>arguendo, </em>was not entirely devoid of color-able merit. <em>See Seyler v. Seyler, </em>678 F.2d 29 (5th Cir.1982) (costs below were inappropriate, but taxing appellate costs and attorneys\u2019 fees warranted). This appeal was taken \u201cin the face of clear, unambiguous, dispositive holdings of this and other appellate courts.\u201d <em>Capps v. Eggers, </em>782 F.2d 1341, 1343 (5th Cir.1986). <em>See McDougal v. Comm\u2019r, </em>818 F.2d 453, 455 (5th Cir.1987) (\u201c[Appellant\u2019s claims] were advanced in the teeth of firmly established rules of law for which there is no arguably reasonable expectation of reversal or favorable modification.\u201d); <em>Stelly v. Comm\u2019r </em>(where the base-lessness of the challenge had been fully elaborated by both the IRS and the Tax Court, the <em>pro se </em>plaintiffs understood the legal issues and were subject to sanctions); <em>Cummings v. United States, </em>648 F.2d 289 (5th Cir. Unit A Jun. 1981) (sanctions for frivolous appeal where subject-matter jurisdiction patently lacking).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b910-6\">We accept <em>arguendo </em>that the appeal here was not taken merely to vex the Waterworks District. Nonetheless, the appeal was patently meritless and had as its natural consequence further unwarranted expense and inconvenience for the defendants. Thus, we must consider whether sanctions are necessary both to compensate the Waterworks District and the Commissioners for their defense of the appeal and to penalize plaintiff and her attorneys for needless consumption of appellate time and resources.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-7\">At least two categories of sanctions are available: costs and attorneys\u2019 fees. One of the applicable provisions on appeal, rule 38, provides that \u201c[i]f a court of appeals shall determine that an appeal is frivolous, it may award just damages and single or double costs to the appellee.\u201d This court recently has confirmed the viability of this provision by assessing both double costs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"813\">*813</page-number>and attorneys\u2019 fees in frivolous appeals.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Other circuits have done the same.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b911-4\">However, we conclude that the circumstances of this case are not egregious enough to justify compensation of the prevailing party beyond its actual out-of-pocket outlays on appeal. Hence, we will not impose both attorneys\u2019 fees and <em>double </em>costs here. Nonetheless, the actions of plaintiff\u2019s counsel are sufficient to suggest the propriety of an award of attorneys\u2019 fees in addition to the <em>single </em>costs normally assessed as of right against the losing party-</p>\n<p id=\"b911-5\">Accepting that counsel in good faith believed the magistrate\u2019s decision to be erroneous, our point is that counsel\u2019s good-faith impression was unreasonable in light of the magistrate\u2019s clear exposition of the law and the attorney\u2019s total inability to distinguish dispositive authority or make rational argument for the extension, modification, or reversal of precedent. Rule 38 concerns are amply raised in this case by conclusory assertions of an alleged right in an appellate brief that cites only two cases, and fails to explain even those two.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b911-6\">In <em>Operating Eng\u2019r Pension Trust v. Cecil Backhoe Serv., Inc., </em>795 F.2d 1501, 1508 (9th Cir.1986), the appellants\u2019 main contention, \u201cto which they devote only two pages of their brief, and in support of which they cite only inapposite authority, satisfie[d] the test of frivolity.\u201d And as to the inclusion of Coghlan\u2019s ulcer and other medical records to establish her \u201cneed\u201d for continued water service, irrelevant evidence and arguments have been recognized to justify rule 38 sanctions. Even though one of the appellee\u2019s contentions was not frivolous in <em>Granado v. Comm\u2019r, </em>792 F.2d 91, 94 (7th Cir.1986) (per curiam), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 107 S.Ct. 1378, 94 L.Ed.2d 692 (1987), $1,500 and double costs were appropriate because 22 of the 24 pages of the opening brief were devoted to unsubstantiated and largely irrelevant legal positions.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-12\">Similarly, the Second Circuit has held that an honest belief in the merits of a claim, and the subjective feeling that a litigant has been denied a fair hearing, do not excuse an appellate brief that \u201cignores significant issues and facts while deploying a smokescreen of irrelevant and tangential issues.\u201d <em>Brady v. Chem. Constr. Corp., </em>740 F.2d 195, 202 (2d Cir.1984). The parallel between <em>Brady </em>and the present case is evident. The Waterworks District\u2019s repeated concessions and other factual information were obscured or omitted in the appellant\u2019s brief. Coghlan and her counsel continue to champion her cause because the original bill was based upon an erroneous <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"814\">*814</page-number>commercial rate. Not only was this billing error speedily corrected long before litigation and thus totally irrelevant to the constitutional claim, but the entire backbill has been waived and removed as an impediment to her obtaining water service. Indeed, their emphasis on the unreasonableness of surprising her with a $206.22 bill only weakened their appeal, because it underscored the lengths to which the District went to accommodate her. This was almost the case in <em>Bank of Canton, Ltd. v. Republic Nat\u2019l Bank, </em>636 F.2d 30, 31 (2d Cir.1980), where the defendant was fined double costs and attorneys\u2019 fees because the trial record indicated that the reasons advanced on appeal for dishonoring the commercial paper \u201cwere totally lacking in merit or were remedied [by the plaintiff] before the letter of credit expired.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b912-4\">While the facts in <em>Brady </em>might have indicated that appeal was taken \u201cto avoid or at least delay contractual obligations,\u201d 740 F.2d at 202, both <em>Brady </em>and <em>Bank of Canton </em>establish that neither delay nor bad purpose are necessary elements to imposition of sanctions after a finding of frivolity. Bad faith may aggravate the circumstances justifying sanctions,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> but harassment of appellants, delay, and other ill practice are not required elements. <em>See </em>Fed.R.App.P. 38 advisory committee note <em>(citing Dunscombe v. Sayle, </em>340 F.2d 311 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>382 U.S. 814, 86 S.Ct. 32, 15 L.Ed.2d 62 (1965)). While the court in <em>Reliance Ins. Co. v. Sweeney Corp., </em>792 F.2d at 1139, could postulate no \u201cpurpose other than to harass and delay\u201d in the unsubstantiated and largely unelabo-rated appellate argument, the court commented:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b912-8\">While the language of \u00a7 1927 suggests deliberate misbehavior, subjective bad faith is not necessary; attorneys have been held accountable for decisions that reflect a reckless indifference to the merits of a claim.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b912-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 1138.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Thus, it is not bad faith that establishes frivolity of appeal, but that an unreasonable legal position is advanced without a \u201cgood faith belief that it is justified.\u201d <em>Clark v. Green, </em>814 F.2d 221, 223 (5th Cir.1987). <em>Accord, Moore v. City of Des Moines, </em>766 F.2d at 346 (\u201cIn the present ease we hold that although the City\u2019s appeal is in good faith, the City has failed to show the district court abused its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"815\">*815</page-number>discretion [and, because there was no color-able merit in the assignments of error, attorneys\u2019 fees and appellate costs are due civil rights plaintiffs as reasonable damages].\u201d).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b913-4\">Although rule 38 is denominated \u201cDamages for Delay,\u201d the body of the rule provides that damages may be awarded for any frivolous appeal, because such merit-less claims impose \u201can unnecessary burden on this court and [tend to infringe upon] the rights of appellees.\u201d <em>Hagerty v. Succession of Clement, </em>749 F.2d at 222 &amp; n. 3 (\u201clegal contentions lack any arguable merit, and are long-settled against him\u201d). <em>See Texas v. Gulf Water Benefaction Co., </em>679 F.2d 85, 87 n. 1 (5th Cir.1982) (\u201c[T]he courts of appeals quite properly allow damages, attorney\u2019s fees and other expenses incurred by an appellee if the appeal is frivolous without requiring a showing that the appeal resulted in delay.\u201d).<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b913-5\">Penalizing this waste of appellate resources, as much as compensation for damages suffered by prevailing parties, is the justification for sanctions. <em>See </em>Fed.R. App.P. 38 advisory committee note (damages appropriate in frivolous appeals \u201cas a matter of justice to the appellee and as a penalty against appellant.\u201d). The Second Circuit has stated concisely the principles involved:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b913-11\">If any doubts existed about the frivolousness of this appeal, we would let the matter rest [with dismissal, but this] appeal is so completely frivolous as to render its prosecution an abuse of the appellate process which, in addition, has put the appellee to heavy expense required to analyze the record, brief the issues and argue the case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b913-12\"><em>Bank of Canton, </em>636 F.2d at 31.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b913-13\">We have ourselves noted, in the context of frivolous tax appeals, the public policy justifications underlying rule 38: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"816\">*816</page-number><em>Stelly, </em>761 F.2d at 1116. <em>See Farguson v. MBank Houston, N.A., </em>808 F.2d 358, 360 (5th Cir.1986). While the point is not decisive in our minds because a major purpose of the sanctions is to deter attorneys from further wasting the courts\u2019 time, we note that reimbursement of defense costs here, as in the tax cases, is made to a governmental entity, and so payment will inure to the public benefit. <em>See George v. Texas, </em>788 F.2d 1099, 1102 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>479 U.S. 866, 107 S.Ct. 226, 93 L.Ed.2d 153 (1986); <em>In re Cosmopolitan Aviation Corp., </em>763 F.2d 507, 517 (5th Cir.1985).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b913-14\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"815\">*815</page-number>Frivolous appeals unjustly burden the resources of the court and the government.

Sanctions are imposed to deter such suits.... [W]hen the claim advanced is unreasonable, or it is not brought with a reasonable good faith belief that it is justified ... in light of the overwhelming and longstanding precedent refuting appellants\u2019 arguments^ sanctions are necessary.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b914-6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"816\">*816</page-number>In <em>Stelly, </em>even <em>pro se </em>plaintiffs were charged with knowledge of \u201cprecedent which uniformly denied validity to their position.\u201d 761 F.2d at 1116.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Here, the appellate brief indicts counsel as having recognized that no authority supports the claim.

As we held in <em>Hagerty v. Succession of Clement, </em>the purpose of sanctions is to discourage meritless litigation and specifically frivolous appeals; penalizing the plaintiff \u201cwill not guarantee that his attorney will be directly affected or that he will be deterred from bringing similar frivolous appeals in the future.\u201d 749 F.2d at 222.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b916-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"818\">*818</page-number>There is ample authority for imposing upon the attorney personally, or upon the attorney and his client <em>in solido, </em>or upon them in specified proportions, any attorneys\u2019 fees awarded in a frivolous appeal.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> In these cases, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1927 is used in tandem with rule 38 as the basis for charging attorneys\u2019 fees in whole or in part to appellant\u2019s counsel personally.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> But many cases under rule 38 assess sanctions against offending counsel, alone or jointly with the client, without reliance upon any authority other than rule 38. <em>Sparks v.

However, even if the Southeast Louisiana Legal Services Corporation\u2019s focus was, in fact, upon \"the rules and regulations of the District and on other matters of procedure,\u201d rather than upon Coghlan\u2019s circumstances, we are not convinced that the standards of rule 11 or, generally, of good-faith litigation, were violated by her three public interest attorneys. As in <em>Stelly, </em>the constitutional claim advanced in the district court was totally lacking in merit, but, again, as there, the unreasonableness of litigating those unsupported and meritless legal positions rose to a level appropriate for sanctions only after the opinion below elaborated why current law could not support the contention advanced.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-10\">Coghlan was represented throughout the proceedings below by counsel, who should have been expected to bring to bear a more sophisticated understanding of the merits of the claim than we would have expected if Coghlan had proceeded <em>pro se. See Reis v. Morrison, </em>807 F.2d 112, 113 (7th Cir.1986). But while any reasonably objective examination of the cases should have revealed to trained readers that Coghlan could not prevail on the merits, her attorneys' negotiations with the Waterworks District and their conduct at trial was not necessarily open to criticism. Her persistent claim of right to continued water service was obstinant, but it was not so outrageous as to have required sanctions below. Thus the underlying suit here was, clearly, neither malicious nor utterly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"817\">*817</page-number>groundless, though Coghlan may, in fact, have shown \"sheer stubbornness with quite a bit of unwillingness to <em>compromise,\" </em>and though her initial attorneys may have demonstrated an irrational belief in their ability to overturn the Waterworks District\u2019s metering policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-5\">Regardless of an appellant\u2019s obstinance, litigation is not frivolous unless devoid of articuable legal support. Accordingly, the meritlessness of the underlying suit is not determinative, in itself, of awarding attorneys' fees and appellate costs. <em>See Freeze v. Griffith, </em>849 F.2d 172, 176 (5th Cir.1988). Even if trial counsel cannot be faulted here for their conduct of the case, appeal of the decision soundly rejecting Coghlan\u2019s claim was unreasonable and frivolous. <em>See Seller v. Seyler, </em>678 F.2d 29 (5th Cir.1982) (taxing costs in the district court was inappropriate, but taxing appellate costs and attorneys\u2019 fees warranted). <em>Compare Farguson, </em>808 F.2d at 358 (severe sanctions appropriate at both the trial and appellate levels for frivolous and duplica-tive complaints) <em>with Nat. Ass'n of Gov. Emp. v. Nat'l Fed\u2019n of Fed. Emp., </em>844 F.2d 216, 224 (5th Cir.1988) (\u201c[Reversing rule 11 sanctions because original complaint] presents no such redundancy and, therefore, when the allegations of the complaint are well grounded, cannot generally serve as the basis for imposing sanctions.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b915-6\">. Although we base imposition of sanctions here upon Fed.R.App.P. 38, ample alternative authority supports similar action.

The Seventh Circuit wrote succinctly in a recent case that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AUYI\">[although Rule 11 is not applicable as such to pleadings filed in this court, in interpreting Rule 38 ... which authorizes sanctions for frivolous appeals, we look to the principles that have evolved in the interpretation of Rule 11.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b915-10\"><em>Sparks v.

C.P., is fully applicable to petitions for en banc consideration.\u201d Inferentially, therefore, this court has heretofore concluded that <em>the standards of rule 11, </em>irrespective of the rule itself, govern appeals to our court. Although no Fifth Circuit cases have awarded rule 11 sanctions on appeal, the mandatory nature of such sanctions where called for in the <em>trial </em>court is amply discussed in our recent <em>en banc </em>decision in <em>Thomas v. Capital Sec. Serv., Inc., </em>836 F.2d 866 (5th Cir.1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b915-12\">Even absent these applicable rules and statutory authorizations, federal courts have inherent power to assess attorneys\u2019 fees in instances of bad faith or willful abuse of process. <em>Roadway Express, Inc. v.

However, counsel emphasizes Coghlan's indigence, \"takes the responsibility for the appeal\u201d upon himself, and urges us to impose sanctions solely upon him.
