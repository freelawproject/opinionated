In the Orphans\u2019 Court an auditor had been appointed upon the accounts of the administrator's of Samuel Merrick, deceased, to make distribution among the creditors, who reported on the 13th March 1841 the sum of $7209.24 principal and interest as payable by John Vaughan, administrator of said estate, to the assignees of William Walker. This report the Orphans\u2019 Court confirmed. On appeal to this court the fund was decided to be payable to the assignee of William Roberts, Jun. On the 4th January 1845, on motion of Mr Miles, this court permitted the name of George Young, assignee of William Roberts, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>Jun., to be appended to the record as a party claiming the fund, and granted two rules, one on all parties interested to show cause why Jacob Snyder, Jun., executor of John Vaughan deceased, who was the administrator of Samuel Merrick deceased, should not pay the amount awarded by the Orphans\u2019 Court to the said George Young. 2. To show cause why John B. Newman, Samuel H. Thomas and Josiah Randall, executors of B. Dahlgren, who was the assignee of John Vaughan, who was the administrator of Samuel Merrick deceased, should not pay the said sum to the said George Young. Answers were put in by the parties respectively, but the question which the court decided was whether the fund, which was in the hands of the executors of B. Dahlgren, could be reached by this mode of proceeding.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"Alm\"><em>Miles, </em>for the assignee,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Abc\">contended it could, assuming that the money was in their hands, but there was some dispute amongst themselves. They were assets of Merrick\u2019s estate, and so considered and adjudged below; not ordinary assets, but such as might be termed special assets, distinguishable from the estate of Merrick, and appropriated by law as well as by the acts of Mr Vaughan, to the payment of this claim. The powers of the Orphans\u2019 Court have been much extended by the Act of 29th March 1832, section 4, <em>Purd. </em>(1841) 808. They have jurisdiction in the distribution of assets among creditors or others interested. It was a devastavit for Vaughan to pass them away; and moreover, these defendants have made themselves parties. The Orphans\u2019 Court is a court of equity, and having the fund under its control, will act in respect to it for all purposes that justice and equity require. <em>Guier </em>v. <em>Kelly, </em>(2 <em>Binn. </em>299); <em>M\u2019Coy </em>v. <em>Porter, </em>(17 <em>Serg. &amp; Rawle </em>60). By the Acts of 14th April 1835, and 16th June 1836, the Supreme Court on appeal are to decide according to right and equity. <em>Mylin\u2019s Estate, </em>(7 <em>Watts </em>64); <em>Aycinena </em>v. <em>Peries, </em>(6 <em>Watts &amp; Serg. </em>243).</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b403-7\"><em>Randall, </em>contra.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AAq\">The fund came into Vaughan\u2019s hands after Merrick\u2019s death, and could not be assets of Merrick\u2019s estate. It was trust property, and not embraced in the settlement of Merrick\u2019s estate. The case of <em>Aycinena </em>v. <em>Peries </em>decides the point in our favour, that the Orphans\u2019 Court had no jurisdiction, nor could the court get it by the application or consent of parties. The Orphans\u2019 Court is a court of limited jurisdiction. 1 <em>Law Journ. </em>321; <em>Grider </em>v. <em>M\u2019Clay, </em>(11 <em>Serg. &amp; Rawle </em>231); <em>Purviance </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>(17 <em>Ibid. </em>37); <em>Metts\u2019s Appeal, </em>(1 <em>Whart. </em>7); <em>Hassler\u2019s Appeal, </em>(5 <em>Watts </em>176); <em>Gossner\u2019s Estate, </em>(6 <em>Whart. </em>403); <em>Olwine\u2019s Appeal, </em>(4 <em>Watts &amp; Serg. </em>492); <em>Merrick\u2019s Estate, </em>(5 <em>Ibid. </em>20); <em>Warner\u2019s Estate, </em>(2 <em>Whart. </em>295). The Orphans\u2019 Court had no jurisdiction over the claim of adversary creditors, and as to them their decree is void.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b404-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>The opinion of the Court was delivered by</p>\n<author id=\"b404-6\">Gibson, C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"Aa9y\">It is a decisive answer to the rule in this case, grafted as it is on the report of an auditor to make distribution among the creditors of an insolvent intestate, that the money in question is no part of the assets. Mr Merrick, the intestate, was the factor of Walker and Coggill, an English house, to whose title the present claimants have succeeded; and the money in contest is the price of goods sold by him as the property of the house, but received by Mr Yaughan, one of his administrators; and consequently not as the intestate\u2019s property, whatever Mr Yaughan himself may have supposed; but, in contemplation of law, as a portion of the partnership effects. Had it been part of the intestate\u2019s assets, it must have gone in a course of administration to pay the general creditors, the English house coming in <em>pro rata </em>as a creditor on its own property; but that the money was not so considered by Mr Yaughan himself, is manifest from the fact that he set it apart for the house in the hands of a trustee, as what has been called in the course of the argument, <em>special </em>assets \u2014 the meaning of which I am unable to conjecture. Assets are said to be real or personal, legal or equitable; but a distinction between general and special,. I believe, has been taken only in the present proceeding. It was this unlucky phrase which, seeming to solve all difficulties at the outset, drew the attention of all concerned from an inquiry into the nature of the title, and made the record of this proceeding a budget of blunders in which this court participated. It would also have been found that a factor, though competent to sell and to sue in his own name, is not the owner either of the property or of - its price, but barely an agent to contract for. his principal; and that his commission, except in very special cases, is revoked by his death. This familiar principle was directly decided in <em>Burdett </em>v. <em>Willet, </em>(2 <em>Vern. </em>638), where it was held that the price of goods sold by a factor is payable not to his administrator, but to the merchant who consigned them to him; and it was held also in <em>Whitecombe </em>v. <em>Jacob, (Salk. </em>160), as well as in many other cases collected in a note to it. The mispayment to Mr Yaughan consequently operated no discharge of the purchaser. The price might have been recovered on the contract of sale, at any time before the confirmation of the transaction by participating in the present proceeding; and it is plain, therefore, that it ought not to have been involved in the factor\u2019s estate. Whether the court would summarily order a stranger to the proceeding to bring it in, even if it were assets, it is at present unnecessary to say. The question, when it. arises, will be whether a creditor can recover a claim immediately from a debtor to the estate, and'not from the administrator or by his agency, but by the instrumentality of an order paramount to him, the court taking the administration of the assets into its own hands. . It is enough for the present, however, that this proceeding is irregular and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>must stop. This trust estate can.be followed into the hands of Mr Dahlgren\u2019s executors who represent him in the management of the fund, only by a bill in equity or perhaps by an action for money had and received. The rule must, therefore, be discharged, the money struck out of the auditor\u2019s report, and the decree affirmed for the residue.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-6\">Decreed accordingly.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
