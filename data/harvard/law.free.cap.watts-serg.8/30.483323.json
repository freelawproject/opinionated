Knox, </em>instead of John Knox, was the member of the firm. The plaintiff\u2019s counsel, therefore, asked the court below to permit him to amend his pleadings by striking out John and inserting James A. The court permitted the amendment to be made, and at defendants\u2019 request sealed a bill of exception. This was the error assigned.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b30-9\"><em>Dunlop, </em>for plaintiff in error,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AC\">cited <em>2 Ld.

On the contrary, we refused such an amendment in <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Wallace, </em>(8 <em>Serg. Rawle </em>53), a case of the same stamp. Perhaps courts ought to be clothed with an unlimited power to amend at discretion, to attain complete justice; but it cannot be assumed without the authority of a statute. We have no such statute for the case before us; for it was held in <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Wallace </em>that the Act of the 28th of March 1818 embraces no more than suits by executors, administrators, trustees or assignees ; and though the suit before us is marked for the use of certain persons, we know of no regularly constituted trust. The statute was meant to provide for cases in which the plaintiffs sue in a representative capacity; and perhaps no other parties were in view as assignees and trustees than those who represent insolvent debtors by an assignment for the benefit of creditors under the insolvent laws. The amendment, therefore, was improperly allowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-12\">Judgment reversed, and <em>venire de novo </em>awarded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
