J. Willits, from the decree of the District Court for the city and county of <em>Philadelphia, </em>allowing B. Tevis and others arrears of ground-rent and interest out of the proceeds of the sheriff\u2019s sale of certain real estate under a judgment of the Western Bank against Willits. The property consisted of five distinct pieces, each of which was subject to a ground-rent, and they were set up and sold subject to the same respectively. The ground-rents were all created by ordinary ground-rent deeds, with the usual covenants and clauses of distress, re-entry, &amp;c.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b381-10\"><em>J.

The principle of that case was treated as a rule of property not to be disturbed in cases of the same stamp; but it was thought'not to be so conclusively founded in legal reason as to be a rule for cases in which the premises were not debtor for the rent. As there was no condition of re-entry in <em>Sands </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>the landlord\u2019s immediate recourse was to the person or chattels of the tenant, as in the case of a tenancy for years. Here there is a clause of re-entry, as there was in <em>Bantleon </em>v. <em>Smith; </em>and as the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>tenant\u2019s estate was immediately liable to malee satisfaction, what matters it whether it has been sold on a judgment recovered by a stranger, or on a judgment recovered by the landlord on the covenant in his ground-rent deed? The'landlord had a lien on the estate of the tenant, and he may have recourse to its substitute brought into court, however the conversion into money may have been effected.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-6\">Decree affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
