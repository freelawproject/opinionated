The Act of 1819 is repealed by the intermediate Act of 7th April 1830, the provisions of whose 9th section correspond with those of the Act of 1834.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b375-7\">\n<em>Per Curiam.</em>\n</author>\n<p id=\"AtMF\">Prisoner remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
