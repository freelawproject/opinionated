On the trial the court directed the jury to bring in their verdict for the plaintiff (without prejudice), and entertained a motion for a new trial, and gave the defendant a bill of exceptions. The death of the plaintiff was afterwards suggested, and Joel Shelly, his administrator, substituted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b153-12\">The following case was stated for the opinion of the court:\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b153-13\">David Yeakle, late of Milford township, in the county of Bucks, died in 1820, intestate, lawfully seised in his demesne as of fee, of and in two tracts of land, situate partly in the county of Bucks and partly in the county of Lehigh, leaving a widow, Ann, and nine children, to wit: Jacob, George, Daniel, Ephraim, Salome who intermarried with Abraham Shelly, Maria, Susan intermarried with Charles Yeakle, Nancy and Rosanna. On the 29th August, 1820, Jacob Yeakle, the eldest son, presented a petition to the Orphans\u2019 Court of Bucks county, praying said court to award an inquest to make partition or valuation of the premises to and among the said parties, agreeably to law. Whereupon said inquest was awarded ; and made return on the 27th November, 1820, after having found \u201c that the same lands and tenements, with their appurtenances, could not be parted and divided to and among the widow and all the children of the said deceased, without prejudice to or spoiling the whole; but that the said lands and tenements as aforesaid would accommodate two of the children of the said deceased.\u201d Said inquisition was confirmed on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>27th February, 1821, and the rule upon the heirs to show cause why they should not appear and accept or refuse returned duly served.

Abraham Shelly either has a right to claim the amount due on No. 2 and 2 in his own right, or as trustee for those who are entitled to the money. He having died since this case stated, and his administrator having been substituted, Joel Shelly will hold the money when it is recovered, as trustee; but we think the action can be maintained in his name.

William Alexander, the clerk of the Orphans\u2019 Court made out some two hundred and fifty recognizances, for the several sums due to each of a great number of heirs presently, as well as for the sums which would be due thereafter. On an appeal, the court did not allow his bill of fees. The usual form of a recognizance to pay to the heirs the sums which should be due to each was said to be of long standing, and fully sufficient for the security of all and every one. In such case each could sue, though not named. Our Act of Assembly would seem to settle this dispute. See 41st section of the act of 29th March, 1832: \u2014 \u201c Should the widow of the decedent be living at the time of the partition, she shall not be entitled to the sum at which her purpart or share of the estate shall be valued, but the same, together with interest thereon, shall be and remain charged upon the premises, if the whole be taken by one child or other descendant of the deceased, or upon the respective shares, if divided as hereinbefore mentioned; and the legal interest thereof shall be annually and regularly paid by the persons to whom such real estate shall be adjudged, <em>their heirs or assigns holding the same, </em>according to their respective portions, to the said widow during her natural life, in lieu and full satisfaction of her dower at common law, and the same may be recovered by the widow, by distress or otherwise, as rents in this commonwealth are recoverable. On the death of the widow the said principal sum shall be paid by the children or other descendants, to whom the same shall have been adjudged, their <em>heirs or assigns holding the same, </em>to the persons thereto legally entitled.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b160-12\">This last provision of the act puts entirely aside one of the objections to the plaintiff\u2019s recovery. The Legislature first secured to the widow, by cumulative remedies, while she lived; and, aware that the person to whom the land had been awarded may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>die or remove to a distance before the death of the widow, they provided expressly that the principal sum charged should be paid to those entitled <em>by the person holding the land, </em>whether he was heir or vendee of the person to whom the land had been allotted in the case by the Orphans\u2019 Court: and this evidently intended to save the heirs respectively their interest directly out of the land, without following him to whom it had been awarded, and who might be insolvent if found. If the person to whom it was awarded had been sued, no doubt the suit must have been on his recognizance. The law made the shares of the heirs a lien until their money became due, and then made the person owning the land liable to a suit and judgment <em>de terris. </em>We have decided that a recovery may be had by <em>assumpsit </em>stating the facts. On the facts the law would imply a promise to pay; but the act removes all doubt, and makes him who holds the land as terre-tenant liable.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-6\">Another objection was made, which, if the facts of this case had been like those in the cases cited, might have availed, viz., that when Abraham Shelly took the land at the valuation, his right to his wife\u2019s share of the valuation being due to him, was merged in the fee vested in him, as he could not be both debtor and creditor. I am not sure this was true as to the share of his wife, though it would generally be true if the share had descended to himself. I say generally true; but when Abraham Shelly sold, he and his vendee might agree otherwise: and they did agree otherwise. The articles of agreement are express, that Stauffer shall pay the sums due to the heirs of D. Yeakle, including the said Abraham Shelly\u2019s hereditary portion; but, to remove all doubt, he gave to Abraham Shelly, one of the heirs of D. Yeakle, a bond for \u00a3132 11s. one year after the land had been allotted to Shelly, and also \u00a366 5s. <em>6d. </em>on the death of the widow. Now, unless the contract is forbidden by a positive enactment, or by the general law, as being contrary to morality or general welfare, every contract is binding; and this was binding. When Stauffer sold to Henry Shelly, the first sum of \u00a3132 11s. had been paid, and the land was conveyed to H. Shelly, \u201c subject to the payment of $33.80 to Ann Yeakle, widow of David Yeakle (the elder), deceased, or her order, on the first of March in every year daring her life, as her lawful dower arising out of the hereby granted premises,\u201d and also \u201c subject to the payment of $563.33, at the decease of the said Ann, to the heirs of the said David Yeakle, or their legal representatives, as the principal sum or fund of the aforesaid annual dower.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b161-7\">This suit is brought for the proportion of that sum which, by the case stated, belonged to Abraham Shelly or his wife. The wife is dead and the widow is dead. After the case was stated and argued, Abraham Shelly died, and his administrator, Joel Shelly, was substituted. The decision is right, both that the sum is recoverable in this suit, and that Joel could be substituted, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>Whether he will hold in trust for himself and his brothers and sisters as heirs of his mother, or as heirs of his father, was mentioned, but not discussed, and, if there is any doubt, may be settled hereafter; but, if his father did not die insolvent, may be perfectly immaterial.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
