The defendant examined witnesses to show that the plaintiff and defendant were partners in the contract. The plaintiff then offered M\u2019Teague as a witness, and produced the following release:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b273-6\">\u201c Whereas Daniel M\u2019Teague did, on the 25th day of March 1843, on the back of a certain note and agreement between him and John Cochran, assign and set over to me all his right and title to the said note and agreement, and all monies due him from said John Cochran:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b273-7\">Now I, William Belt, do hereby release and discharge the said Daniel M\u2019Teague from all right of action, claims and demand for and on account of said matters so assigned to me, fully and absolutely, whether I or the person to whom I have assigned the same shall recover of the said Cochran or his administrators or estate any money, or wholly fail to recover anything upon said claims against said John Cochran or his representatives.

Carter, who testified as follow's : \u2014 I know that M\u2019Teague has no interest in any way in this matter. The transfer was made before suit at my office; both parties were present. Belt gave M\u2019Teague his note for $400 payable in nine months. The transfer was made for the purpose of M\u2019Teague\u2019s being a witness. I can\u2019t say that M\u2019Teague was indebted to Belt. He brought Belt to my office. Belt\u2019s note is taken up in the transfer to Bouvier. That transfer was to have been made previous to the last court, but was not executed until January. I saw no consideration pass. Belt\u2019s note has been surrendered. It is to Judge Bouvier to whom the transfer has been made. Mr Elliott has feed me as the agent of Bouvier. What I know is from the parties. <em>Cross-examined. </em>\u2014 I have one or two letters from Judge Bouvier. He sent me a form of the transfer. I think I could find it. He has not been here at all himself. The first assignment was executed at Belt\u2019s house; he and his lady were present. Belt and myself were present to-day. Belt\u2019s note to M\u2019Teague was surrendered 17th January. I handed it to him. The note had remained in my possession from the time of the first transfer from M\u2019Teague to Belt.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b273-11\">The plaintiff then called M\u2019Teague, who on his voir dire stated : \u2014Bouvier paid $330 in cash to Belt in January when the transfer was made. I don\u2019t know what became of the note; it was in Carter\u2019s hands. The $330 was paid to me; the moment I had the money paid down, I signed the agreement drawn up in Judge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>Bouvier\u2019s office. I have parted with all my interest in the claim. The money was paid to me by Judge Bouvier in his office. <em>Cross-examined. </em>\u2014 I signed an agreement against Belt\u2019s note. I don\u2019t know what became of the agreement. . I received specie in part and $105 in notes. I don\u2019t know who subposnaed the witnesses. Elliott gave the directions as to the subpoenas. I accompanied him to Carter\u2019s office. Elliott is not here to-day, nor was he yesterday. I subpoenaed Le Brun. I was at Squire Bartram\u2019s office when the depositions of Saur\u00edn and Le Brun were taken. I happened to be in Carter\u2019s office, and he took me there; he did not say what for. I did suggest questions to my counsel in the examination. I had possession of Belt\u2019s note, but not out of Carter\u2019s office. The moment it was witnessed, it was handed into Belt\u2019s hand, and he handed it to me; it was witnessed by Carter; no others present.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b274-6\">The defendant objected to M\u2019Teague as incompetent, but the court admitted him and sealed a bill of exceptions.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b274-7\">Some other exceptions were taken, but not insisted on here.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b274-8\"><em>Edwards, </em>for the plaintiff in error,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Aku\">referred to <em>Ludwig </em>v. <em>Meyre, </em>(5 <em>Watts &amp; Serg. </em>535).</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b274-9\"><em>Darlington, </em>contra.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b274-10\">The opinion of the Court was delivered by</p>\n<author id=\"b274-11\">Sergeant, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Aub\">This case seems to fall within the principles decided in <em>Patterson </em>v. <em>Reed, </em>(7 <em>Watts &amp; Serg. </em>144), and in the previous cases of <em>Leiper </em>v. <em>Peirce, </em>(6 <em>Watts &amp; Serg. 555), </em>and <em>Post </em>v. <em>Avery </em>(5 <em>Ibid. </em>509). A few months before the commencement of the suit, M\u2019Teague, alleging a claim against Cochran upon a note not negotiable and a contract for wages, assigns his interest to Belt, who then brings suit in M\u2019Teague\u2019s name for his own use. The defendant sets up a partnership, and to repel this and procure a verdict, M\u2019Teague is produced as a witness. To introduce his evidence and show that it was a fair and <em>bond fide </em>transaction, Carter is examined, who states that the transfer was made for the purpose of making M\u2019Teague a witness. If so, then M\u2019Teague, in consideration of transferring his claim, not only gives his note for $330, but undertakes virtually to sustain the claim by his testimony, which brings it directly within the decision in <em>Patterson </em>v. <em>Reed, </em>and makes it indeed a much stronger case; for here the condition is direetly avowed, which there was inferred from the circumstances. It is not to be expected that such a party to the record should be an indifferent witness, though he has assigned his claim, if he is still under an obligation to the assignee to stand ready as a witness for him when necessary to help out a doubtful case before the jury. There are some other circumstances calculated to raise suspicion, such as the note\u2019s not being delivered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>over to M\u2019Teague but remaining in the hands of Carter, who appears to have been an agent of both, as well as Bouvier, and moreover, the activity of M\u2019Teague in the preparation of the suit, that render doubtful that fairness in the transaction which the party offering such witness is bound to establish before he can be considered as competent.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">Judgment reversed, and a <em>venire de novo </em>awarded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
