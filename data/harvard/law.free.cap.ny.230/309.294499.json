Schultz, deceased. The award was made upon the theory that Schultz sustained fatal injuries arising out of and in the course of his employment by the Champion Welding and Manufacturing Company. The business of this company was \u201c welding and machine work.\u201d Schultz was the foreman of its shop and also \u2022 looked after certain outside work. Shortly after five o\u2019clock in the afternoon on the 10th of September, 1919, he left the shop to take charge of an outside job. The employer had an automobile which Schultz, at times, was permitted to use and which he did on this occasion. After <em>he had </em>finished <em>his day\u2019s work </em>he drove the car to his own home, it being left entirely to him to determine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>whether he would take it there or back to his employer\u2019s garage. His compensation in no way depended upon the use of the car and when he decided to take it to his own home his relation was that of a borrower. He kept the car over night and in the morning started to drive it, on a public highway, to his employer\u2019s place of business. While doing so the car collided with another car and he received injuries from which he died shortly thereafter.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-4\">His injuries did not arise out of and in the course of his employment. The risk involved in using the car to go to the place where he was employed on the occasion referred to was no more a risk of the business of the employer than it would have been had he walked. The words \u201c arising out of and in the course of the employment \u201d have a clear and definite meaning and relief under the statute can only be given when the injuries arise <em>both </em>out of and in the course of the employment. <em>(Matter of Heitz </em>v. <em>Ruppert, </em>218 N. Y. 148; <em>Matter of Daly </em>v. <em>Bates &amp; Roberts, </em>224 N. Y. 126.) This injury did not arise out of either. It occurred while he was on the way to the place where he was employed and before the time when he was to go to work.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">This court has recently held that where an employee is injured while on his way to the place where he is to render service, such injuries do not arise out of the employment and are not connected therewith. <em>(Matter of Kowalek </em>v. <em>New York Consolidated R. R. Co., </em>229 N. Y. 489; <em>Pierson </em>v. <em>Interborough Rapid Transit Co., </em>184 App. Div. 678; affd., 227 N. Y. 666.)</p>\n<p id=\"b359-6\">The order of the Appellate Division and the award of the state industrial commission should, therefore, be reversed, and the claim dismissed, with costs in this court and in the Appellate Division against the state industrial commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-7\">His cock, Ch. J., Hogan and Crane, JJ., concur; Cardozo, Pound and Andrews, JJ., dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-8\">Ordered accordingly.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
