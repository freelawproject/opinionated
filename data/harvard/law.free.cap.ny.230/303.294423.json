Rayher </em>for appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AcL\">The manager of a corporation, who is also its secretary and treasurer, who owns eighty-five per cent of its capital stock, dictates its policy, employs and discharges all employees and receives three separate salaries (one as manager, one as secretary and one as treasurer), which he votes to himself, is as such, not an employee, and, therefore, is not entitled to the benefits of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law if he meets with an accident. <em>(Bowne </em>v. <em>Bowne Co., </em>221 N.

He was, therefore, entitled to compensation.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b352-6\">Hiscock, Ch. J.</author>\n<p id=\"Azp\">In this case it has been found that the claimant owned a large proportion of the capital stock of a comparatively small electric light and power company and was its secretary and treasurer; that he was employed as a general manager and as such <em>\u201c </em>performed manual labor at his employer\u2019s plant * * * and away from the plant; that his weekly wage as such general manager was the sum of $25.</p>\n<p id=\"Aan\">The decision of this case is largely controlled by what has been said in the <em>Skouitchi </em>and <em>Kolpien </em>cases, decided herewith. The findings, which are conclusive upon us, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>show that the claimant was <em>\u201c </em>employed <em>\u201d </em>as general manager; that in such capacity he performed various manual services such as an ordinary employee might perform and that for his services in this particular capacity he received a certain weekly wage. In this latter respect the findings differ from those made in the other two cases to which reference has been made in that they show just what his wages were in his capacity of employee. Under these circumstances we think that the award is sustained by the findings and that the order of the Appellate Division should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-4\">Hogan, Cardozo, Pound, McLaughlin, Crane and Andrews, JJ., concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">Order affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
