We affirm the conviction and remand for correction of the written judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-4\">\u00b62 Birthmark presents the following issues for review:</p>\n<p id=\"b436-5\">\u00b63 Issue One: Whether Birthmark\u2019s attorney provided ineffective assistance of counsel by failing to object to the mental state instructions given at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-6\">\u00b64 Issue Two: Whether this Court should exercise plain error review as to whether the District Court properly instructed the jury as to the mental state required to convict for PFMA.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-7\">\u00b65 Issue Three: Whether the written judgment should be corrected.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-8\">PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b436-9\">\u00b66 In November 2010 Birthmark visited Glasgow, Montana, and stayed at the house shared by his mother, brother and sister. Late on the night of November 16 Birthmark and his sister went to a party at his aunt\u2019s nearby house. He got into an argument with someone at the party and at about 1:30 a.m. returned to his mother\u2019s house angry and intoxicated. When he arrived, his brother was awake and watching TV, while his mother was asleep. Birthmark was loud enough that he woke his mother and she came into the living room. Birthmark then began staring at his mother and brother, and called them \u201cinbreds\u201d and snitches. He grabbed a piece of lumber and said he was going to \u201cbash [their] heads in;\u201d that he was going to slice their necks and kill them; and that he would do the same to the people at the party. This conduct went on for some time.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-10\">\u00b67 When Birthmark left the living room for the kitchen, saying he was going to find a knife, his mother left the house and called 911. Glasgow Police Officer Weber responded and found Birthmark\u2019s mother outside the house. She was upset, crying and \u201cscared to death.\u201d Weber saw Birthmark\u2019s brother coming out of the house with Birthmark close behind, but when Birthmark saw Weber he quickly went back inside. Birthmark\u2019s brother was concerned for his mother and warned Weber that Birthmark had a knife. Birthmark came out of the house at Weber\u2019s request without the piece of lumber or a knife. Weber observed that Birthmark was intoxicated and \u201cworked up.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b436-11\">\u00b68 The State charged Birthmark with PFMA in violation of \u00a7 45-5-206(l)(c), MCA, for causing reasonable apprehension of bodily injury by his mother and brother. The charge was his third or subsequent such offense and was therefore a felony, \u00a7 45-5-206(3)(iv), MCA. At <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>trial, Birthmark testified that he had been \u201cjumped\u201d by people at the party; that he was concerned for his sister who was at the party; and that his anger displayed at his mother\u2019s house was not directed at his mother and brother but was directed toward the people at the party. Birthmark testified that his mother and brother \u201cinferred ... or assumed\u201d that his threats were directed at them.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-4\">\u00b69 At trial, Birthmark\u2019s attorney did not offer any proposed jury instructions, and stated that he had no objection to the instructions proposed by the State. The jury convicted Birthmark of PFMA and the District Court sentenced him to the Department of Corrections for four years with one year suspended and with credit for 273 days served. Birthmark appeals and requests that this Court undertake plain error review of the jury instruction issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b437-6\">\u00b610 This Court reviews issues arising from a district court\u2019s decisions on jury instructions for abuse of discretion. <em>State v. Gerstner, </em>2009 MT 303, \u00b6 15, 353 Mont. 86, 219 P.3d 866. The inquiry, viewing the instructions as a whole, is whether the district court fully and fairly instructed the jury on the applicable law. <em>State v. Dethman, </em>2010 MT 268, \u00b6 12, 358 Mont. 384, 245 P.3d 30. Claims of ineffective assistance of counsel are mixed questions of fact and law that this Court reviews de novo. <em>State v. Mitchell, </em>2012 MT 227, \u00b6 11, 366 Mont. 379, 286 P.3d 1196.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-7\">\u00b611 Under plain error review, this Court may review errors not objected to at trial. Plain error review may occur under \u00a7 46-20-701(2), MCA, or as a matter of discretion under this Court\u2019s inherent common law powers. <em>State v. Finley, </em>276 Mont. 126, 915 P.2d 208 (1995). Plain error review is used sparingly and only in situations that implicate a manifest miscarriage of justice, leave unsettled the question of the fundamental fairness of the proceedings, or compromise the integrity of the judicial process. <em>State v. Main, </em>2011 MT 123, \u00b6 53, 360 Mont. 470, 255 P.3d 1240. The initial burden on a defendant seeking plain error review is to demonstrate that there was an error at trial. <em>State v. Mitchell, </em>2012 MT 227, \u00b6 13, 366 Mont. 379, 286 P.3d 1196.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b437-9\">\u00b612 Issue One: Whether Birthmark\u2019s attorney provided ineffective assistance of counsel by failing to object to the mental state instructions given at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-10\">\u00b613 Birthmark contends that his trial attorney provided ineffective <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>assistance of counsel by not objecting to the instructions given by the District Court. To prevail on an IAC claim the defendant must establish that his attorney\u2019s performance was deficient and that the deficiency prejudiced the defense. <em>Baca v. State, </em>2008 MT 371, \u00b6 16, 346 Mont. 474, 197 P.3d 948; <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 104 S. Ct. 2052. A defendant must establish both of these factors in order to establish a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. <em>Whitlow v. State, </em>2008 MT 140, \u00b6 11, 343 Mont. 90, 183 P.3d 861.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-4\">\u00b614 Birthmark was charged with PFMA under \u00a7 45-5-206(l)(c), MCA, which provides that a person commits PFMA if he \u201cpurposely or knowingly causes reasonable apprehension of bodily injury in a partner or family member.\u201d \u201cPurposely\u201d is defined in \u00a7 45-2-101(65), MCA, and \u201cknowingly\u201d is defined in \u00a7 45-2-101(35), MCA. The District Court instructed the jury that \u201c[a] person acts purposely when it is his conscious object to engage in conduct of that nature,\u201d and, in a separate instruction, that \u201c[a] person acts knowingly when the person is aware of his or her conduct.\u201d The District Court also instructed the jury that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-5\">Purpose and knowledge ordinarily may not be proved directly because there is no way of fathoming or scrutinizing the operations of the human mind. But you may infer the Defendant\u2019s state of mind, including his purpose and knowledge, from the Defendant\u2019s acts and all other facts and circumstances in evidence which indicate his state of mind.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b438-6\">Birthmark contends that the District Court\u2019s definitions of \u201cpurposely\u201d and \u201cknowingly\u201d were improper because they were \u201cconduct-based\u201d definitions and not \u201cresult-based\u201d definitions.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-7\">\u00b615 Birthmark did not materially contest his actions at his mother\u2019s house: staring at his brother and mother, using loud language, name-calling, picking up a large stick, talking about finding a knife, threatening to bash their heads in and to slit their throats. His defense was that he did not intend these actions to cause his brother and mother to have a reasonable apprehension of bodily injury. He contends that the jury should have been instructed that the State was required to prove that he intended his actions to cause his mother and brother to have reasonable apprehension of bodily injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-8\">\u00b616  Birthmark\u2019s subjective intent while he undertook his actions was not the issue in the PFMA charge. It is well established that under the \u201creasonable apprehension\u201d portion of the PFMA statute, the standard for determining whether there has been an offense is whether a reasonable person under similar circumstances as the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>victim would have a reasonable apprehension of bodily injury. <em>State v. Vukasin, </em>2003 MT 230, \u00b6 19, 317 Mont. 204, 75 P.3d 1284; <em>State v. McCarthy, </em>1999 MT 99, \u00b6 27, 294 Mont. 270, 991 P.2d 629; <em>State v. Martel, </em>273 Mont. 143, 150, 902 P.2d 14, 19 (1995). \u201cThe standard is objective, asking whether a reasonable person under similar circumstances would have reasonably apprehended bodily injury.\u201d <em>State v. Finley, </em>2011 MT 89, \u00b6 29, 360 Mont. 173, 252 P.3d 199. The only mental state required to convict is that the defendant have a \u201cconscious object to engage in [the] conduct\u201d or that he be \u201caware of his ... conduct\u201d as defined in \u00a7 45-2-101(35) and (65), MCA.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Those conduct definitions were in the instructions that the District Court gave to the jury here.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-4\">\u00b617  In <em>State v. Martin, </em>2001 MT 83, 305 Mont. 123, 23 P.3d 216, Martin was charged with a number of offenses following an attempt to cash a forged check at a bank. He was charged with felony assault under \u00a7 45-5-202(2)(b), MCA, for purposely or knowingly causing reasonable apprehension of seriously bodily injury after pointing a pistol at a pursuing officer. Martin testified that he did not intend to cause the officer to reasonably apprehend serious bodily injury, and argued on appeal that his mental state, and not the perception of the officer, determined the mental state required for conviction. This Court disagreed, holding that the only mental state required as to Martin was proof that he acted purposely or knowingly. The separate element of the offense-causing reasonable apprehension of serious bodily injury-is established by the perception of the victim. <em>Martin, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 54-55. See also <em>State v. Hagberg, </em>277 Mont. 33, 39-40, 920 P.2d 86, 89 (1996) (victim\u2019s testimony of reasonable apprehension of serious bodily injury satisfies element of assault); <em>State v. Matt, </em>249 Mont. 136, 146, 814 P.2d 52, 58 (1991) <em>(overruled on other grounds, State v. District Court, </em>2010 MT 263, \u00b6 3, 358 Mont. 325, 246 P.3d 415) (in felony assault charge the defendant must act purposely or knowingly, and the reasonable apprehension element is proved by the victim\u2019s perceptions).</p>\n<p id=\"b439-5\">\u00b618 The District Court properly instructed the jury in the applicable law on the mental state for the PFMA offense. Birthmark was not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>entitled to an instruction that the jury be required to find that he intended to cause his mother and brother to have reasonable apprehension of bodily injury. If such an instruction had been offered the District Court could have properly refused to give it.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-4\">\u00b619 The District Court\u2019s instructions were proper in this case. To establish deficient performance, an appellant must overcome the strong presumption that counsel\u2019s conduct falls within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance. <em>Mitchell, </em>\u00b6 21. The record here clearly demonstrates that Birthmark has not met his burden to establish deficient performance, and his attorney\u2019s assistance was therefore not ineffective.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">\u00b620 Issue Two: Whether this Court should exercise plain error review of whether the District Court properly instructed the jury as to the mental state required to convict for PFMA.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-6\">\u00b621 Birthmark requests that this Court undertake common law plain error review of the instruction issue, and does not rely upon \u00a7 46-20-701(2), MCA, the statutory provision on plain error. The threshold requirement for any plain error review of matters not objected to at trial is that there be error. As discussed above, the instructions given by the District Court properly defined \u201cpurposely\u201d and \u201cknowingly\u201d for purposes of the PFMA charge against Birthmark, and there was no error. Without error there is no reason for further review of the instruction issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-7\">\u00b622 Issue Three: Whether the written judgment should be corrected.</p>\n<p id=\"ADp\">\u00b623 After Birthmark\u2019s opening brief was filed in this appeal, his attorney contacted the State\u2019s attorney about an error in the District Court\u2019s written judgment. The error was that the written judgment imposed terms and conditions to apply during any term of parole or conditional release. The State concedes that the District Court may not impose conditions of parole or conditional release, citing <em>State v. Burch, </em>2008 MT 118, \u00b6\u00b6 24-26, 342 Mont. 499, 182 P.3d 66, and that the written judgment should be amended. The State also agrees that this issue should be addressed in this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-8\">\u00b624 Accordingly, this matter is remanded to the District Court for the sole purpose of removing language in the August 22, 2011, judgment, page 4, line 22, that imposes terms and conditions of parole or conditional release.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-9\">\u00b625 This matter is remanded to the District Court for purposes of correcting the written judgment as discussed above, but is otherwise affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b440-10\">JUSTICES BAKER, McKINNON, WHEAT and RICE concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b439-6\"> Compare, \u00a7 45-8-213(l)(a), MCA, which establishes the offense of violating privacy in communications, and which requires that the State prove that the defendant acted with a \u201cpurpose to terrify, intimidate, threaten, harass, annoy or offend....\u201d <em>State v. Dugan, </em>2013 MT 38, \u00b6 50, 369 Mont. 39, 303 P.3d 755. There is no such requirement in \u00a7 45-5-206(1)(c), MCA.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
