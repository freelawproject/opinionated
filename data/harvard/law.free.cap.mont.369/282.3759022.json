Wilson argues that the District Court deprived Wilson of his fundamental right to be present at all critical stages of the proceedings against him. Wilson was not present at a sidebar conference during jury selection after which the District Court removed a potential juror from the jury pool. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-9\">\u00b62 Wilson presents the following issue on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b305-10\">\u00b63 <em>Whether Wilson\u2019s absence from the sidebar conference during jury selection requires reversal of the trial verdict </em>?</p>\n<p id=\"b305-11\">PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b305-12\">\u00b64 Wilson was drinking at the Whiskey Gulch Saloon in Colstrip, Montana, on December 10, 2009. Jason Burnett, Spencer Benson, Heath Becker, Terran Harris and a group of friends also were at Whiskey Gulch Saloon to celebrate Burnett\u2019s recent engagement. Burnett\u2019s family owned the saloon. Wilson started a fistfight with Harris. Burnett and others helped to break up the fight. Burnett ordered Wilson to leave.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-13\">\u00b65 Wilson returned to the saloon approximately thirty minutes later with a gun. Becker was standing outside the saloon near the back deck. Wilson killed Becker with a shot to his head. Benson also was outside the saloon near his own car. Wilson killed Benson with a shot to his chest. Wilson then entered the saloon and walked toward Burnett and his friends. Wilson shot Burnett in the head, injuring, but not killing Burnett. Harris and others disarmed Wilson.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-14\">\u00b66 The State charged Wilson with deliberate homicide. The list of potential jurors included several of the EMTs who had responded to the shooting. The Court discussed this fact with the parties at the beginning of the jury selection process. The prosecutor noted that he had listed these same EMTs as potential witnesses. The prosecutor explained that he no longer anticipated calling any of the EMTs as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>witnesses. As a result, the prosecutor would not stipulate at that time that all of the EMTs were unfit for jury service.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-4\">\u00b67 The first group of potential jurors called by the clerk included Amanda McCarthy (McCarthy), one of these EMTs. The record reflects the following interaction:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b306-5\">THE COURT: Would the clerk call the next prospective juror?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Akt\">THE CLERK: Amanda M. McCarthy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b306-6\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Your Honor, may we have a sidebar with this juror?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b306-7\">(Wherein, a sidebar is held with all attorneys and the Court in attendance.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b306-8\">THE COURT: I\u2019m sorry, Ms. McCarthy. We should have caught this ahead of time. By stipulation you are excused. Thank you.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AOn\">\u00b68 Wilson was present in the courtroom during the jury selection process, including during this interaction. The court reminded counsel and informed Wilson at the beginning of the jury selection in Wilson\u2019s trial that Wilson had a right to be present. The District Court stated that \u201cthe Defendant must always be present. I know we all understand that rule. But at every conference in here, outside the presence of the jury, anything like that, I will expect-jury instructions being settled, anything like that, the Defendant must be present.\u201d Wilson did not join his counsel at the sidebar conference. The jury found Wilson guilty of deliberate homicide, attempted deliberate homicide, and negligent homicide. The District Court sentenced Wilson to 220 years at the Montana State Prison. Wilson argues that the District Court violated his fundamental right to be present at all critical stages of the proceedings when he was absent from the sidebar conference after which the District Court removed McCarthy from the pool of potential jurors.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-9\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b306-10\">\u00b69 We exercise plenary review over constitutional questions, including alleged violations of a criminal defendant\u2019s right to be present at critical stages of the proceedings against him. <em>State v. Charlie, </em>2010 MT 195, \u00b6 21, 357 Mont. 355, 239 P.3d 934.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-11\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b306-12\">\u00b610 <em>Whether Wilson\u2019s absence from the sidebar conference during jury selection requires reversal of the trial verdict?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b306-13\">\u00b611 Both the Montana Constitution and the United States Constitution guarantee a defendant the right to be present at all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>\u201ccritical stages\u201d of the criminal proceedings against him. <em>State v. Matt, </em>2008 MT 444, \u00b6\u00b6 16-17, 347 Mont. 530, 199 P.3d 244 (partially overruled on other grounds by <em>Charlie, </em>\u00b6 45); <em>Charlie, </em>\u00b6 40. A critical stage includes \u201cany step of the proceeding where there is potential for substantial prejudice to the defendant.\u201d <em>Matt, </em>\u00b6 17. A violation of a defendant\u2019s right to be present at all critical stages does not require automatic reversal. <em>State v. Price, </em>2009 MT 129, \u00b6 24, 350 Mont. 272, 207 P.3d 298. We reverse for a new trial only if the defendant suffered prejudice from missing a critical stage. <em>Price, </em>\u00b6 24. We emphasize, however, that a trial court should make every effort to ensure that a defendant appears at all critical stages of the proceedings, or, in the alternative, that the trial court accepts on the record the defendant\u2019s waiver of his right to appear at a particular proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-4\">\u00b612 We generally first consider whether the defendant missed a critical stage of the proceedings. <em>Matt, </em>\u00b6 19; <em>Price, </em>\u00b6 23. We next consider whether the defendant waived his right to be present at the critical stage of the proceedings. <em>Matt, </em>\u00b6 23; <em>Price, </em>\u00b6 23. We finally consider whether this constitutional violation of missing a critical stage caused prejudice to the defendant. <em>Matt, </em>\u00b6 38; <em>Price, </em>\u00b6 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">\u00b613 This Court has not yet addressed whether a sidebar conference during voir dire constitutes a critical stage. We conclude, however, that Wilson\u2019s absence from the sidebar conference did not cause him prejudice. Accordingly, we need not consider the initial questions of whether the sidebar conference constituted a critical stage of the criminal proceedings or whether Wilson waived his right to attend. <em>See Price, </em>\u00b6 25. We instead will assume for the purposes of our analysis that Wilson missed a critical stage of the criminal proceedings and that he did not waive his right to be present. <em>See Price, </em>\u00b6 25.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-6\">\u00b614 For the prejudice analysis, the State bears the burden of persuasion that no reasonable probability exists that this constitutional violation caused prejudice to Wilson. <em>Charlie, </em>\u00b6 45. The State cannot meet this burden of persuasion if Wilson\u2019s absence from the sidebar conference constituted a structural error. A structural error contaminates the very framework within which the trial proceeds. <em>Matt, </em>\u00b6 32. The State could not demonstrate that no reasonable probability of prejudice exists due to the fact that structural errors \u201cnecessarily render a trial fundamentally unfair.\u201d <em>Matt, </em>\u00b6 32. Structural errors therefore require automatic reversal. <em>Matt, </em>\u00b6 32.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-7\">\u00b615 Wilson argues that his absence from the sidebar conference constituted a structural error. The United States Supreme Court has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>recognized only a limited number of structural errors. <em>Matt, </em>\u00b6 31. These structural errors include the lack of an impartial trial judge, <em>Tumey v. Ohio, </em>273 U.S. 510, 47 S. Ct. 437 (1927), total deprivation of the right to counsel, <em>Gideon v. Wainwright, </em>372 U.S. 335, 83 S. Ct. 792 (1963), and the right to self-representation at trial, <em>McKaskle v. Wiggins, </em>465 U.S. 168, 104 S. Ct. 944 (1984). <em>See Matt, </em>\u00b6 31. This Court determined under the Montana Constitution that a defendant\u2019s absence during the voir dire questioning of a potential juror constituted a structural error. <em>State v. Bird, </em>2002 MT 2, \u00b6 40, 308 Mont. 75, 43 P.3d 266.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-4\">\u00b616 Wilson argues that our determination in <em>Bird, </em>that a defendant\u2019s absence from voir dire of the juror constitutes a structural error, controls our determination here. The trial court in <em>Bird </em>granted the State\u2019s motion to conduct in chambers individual voir dire of any potential juror who had personal experience with domestic violence. <em>Bird, </em>\u00b6 12. Bird was absent from the voir dire questioning of a potential juror who made comments that suggested she would be biased against Bird. The potential juror explained that she worked as an emergency room nurse and often had to treat victims of domestic violence. <em>Bird, </em>\u00b6 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-5\">\u00b617 The trial court denied a motion by Bird\u2019s counsel to remove this potential juror for cause. The court removed eight of the eleven potential jurors who were questioned in chambers. Bird\u2019s counsel used all of his peremptory challenges to remove other potential jurors, rather than to remove the emergency room nurse whom he earlier had sought to remove for cause. <em>Bird, </em>\u00b6 16. The emergency room nurse then became a member of Bird\u2019s jury. We determined that Bird\u2019s absence constituted a structural error. The emergency room nurse\u2019s inclusion as part of the jury affected the framework of Bird\u2019s trial and rendered the entire trial fundamentally unfair. <em>Bird, </em>\u00b6 40.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-6\">\u00b618 Wilson argues that the sidebar conference included voir dire questioning of McCarthy. Wilson points to the transcript as proof that McCarthy attended the sidebar conference. The transcript reflects that Wilson\u2019s counsel requested a sidebar \u201cwith\u201d McCarthy. The transcript\u2019s list of people who attended the sidebar conference omits any reference to McCarthy. The transcript simply states that \u201ca sidebar is held with all attorneys and the Court in attendance.\u201d The record does not demonstrate that McCarthy was present at the sidebar conference. Further, the court\u2019s comment at the end of the sidebar conference, that \u201c[w]e should have caught this ahead of time,\u201d implies that the topic of the sidebar conference dealt with previously available information, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>rather than information gathered from voir dire questioning of McCarthy. Nothing in the record or the court\u2019s comments after the sidebar indicates that either the court or the parties engaged McCarthy in any voir dire examination. The court then announced that McCarthy had been removed \u201c[b]y stipulation\u201d of the counsel, rather than having been removed for cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-4\">\u00b619  Nothing in the transcript indicates that Wilson missed any voir dire questioning of McCarthy. Additionally, McCarthy did not serve on Wilson\u2019s jury. Wilson could not have suffered, therefore, from the type of structural error that arose in <em>Bird </em>of having a potentially biased juror serve as a member of his jury. <em>See Bird, </em>\u00b6 40. <em>Bird </em>does not control our determination on whether Wilson\u2019s absence from the sidebar conference constituted a structural error. The State argues that no particular event took place at the sidebar conference that necessarily rendered the entire trial fundamentally unfair in a manner similar to a biased judge, lack of counsel, or a biased juror. <em>See Matt, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 31, 40. We agree. Wilson\u2019s absence from the sidebar conference does not rise to the level of structural error under these circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"AdR\">\u00b620 We now must consider whether the State has met its burden of persuasion of demonstrating that no reasonable probability exists that this constitutional violation caused prejudice to Wilson. <em>Charlie, </em>\u00b6 45. The State argues that Wilson had no right to have a particular juror sit on his jury, only the right to a fair and impartial jury. <em>State v. Taylor, </em>168 Mont. 142, 146, 542 P.2d 100, 102 (1975). The State further argues that no prejudice could have resulted to Wilson when the prosecutor and Wilson\u2019s counsel apparently agreed to stipulate to the removal of McCarthy from the group of potential jurors.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">\u00b621 We have considered several times whether a defendant suffered prejudice by missing a conference that ultimately resulted in the removal of a juror. One of the jurors spoke with one of the prospective witnesses about the ongoing trial in <em>State v. Kennedy, </em>2004 MT 53, \u00b6 1, 320 Mont. 161, 85 P.3d 1279. The court met alone with the juror in chambers. Kennedy, Kennedy\u2019s counsel, and the prosecutor were not present. <em>Kennedy, </em>\u00b6 10. The court met with counsel in chambers only after the court had spoken alone with the juror. Kennedy was not present at this second meeting.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-6\">\u00b622 The prosecutor moved to replace the juror with an alternate juror and to exclude the witness from testifying. The court granted the motions. <em>Kennedy, </em>\u00b6 11. Kennedy claimed prejudice from the missed opportunity to question the juror about his interaction with the prospective witness. We determined that no prejudice to Kennedy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>resulted from his absence from this critical stage. The Court mooted any prejudice that Kennedy may have suffered when it removed the juror from the jury panel and the witness did not testify. <em>Kennedy, </em>\u00b6 34.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-4\">\u00b623 We again considered in <em>Price </em>whether the defendant suffered prejudice by not attending a conference where the court had decided to remove a juror. One of the jurors informed the court during the trial that she recognized a prospective witness. <em>Price, </em>\u00b6 35. The court conducted a conference with the juror, the prosecutor, and Price\u2019s counsel. Price was not present. The juror admitted at the conference that she would be less likely to believe the witness\u2019s testimony based on her personal knowledge of this prospective witness. <em>Price, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 35-36. The court granted the request by Price\u2019s counsel to remove the juror. The court\u2019s removal of the juror mooted any potential prejudice toward Price. <em>Price, </em>\u00b6 38.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">\u00b624 As previously noted, we lack a full transcript of the sidebar conference. We considered in <em>State v. Tapson, </em>2001 MT 292, 307 Mont. 428, 41 P.3d 305, how to analyze prejudice when no record existed of the conversation that the defendant did not attend. The court in <em>Tapson </em>personally carried a substitute verdict form into the jury room. The prosecutor, Tapson\u2019s counsel, and Tapson were not present. No record existed of what occurred in the jury room, including whether the trial judge answered any questions for the jury. The lack of a record made it impossible to determine that the encounter caused no prejudice to the defendant. <em>Tapson, </em>\u00b6 31. We contrasted the absence of a record in <em>Tapson </em>in both <em>Price </em>and <em>Kennedy, </em>where a full record existed to describe what occurred while the defendant had been absent. <em>Kennedy, </em>\u00b6 32; <em>Price, </em>\u00b6 33.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-6\">\u00b625 We likewise have analyzed potential prejudice to the defendant where only a partial record of an omnibus hearing existed in <em>State v. Heavygun, </em>2011 MT 111, 360 Mont. 413, 253 P.3d 897. Heavygun did not attend an omnibus hearing. No verbatim record of the hearing existed, but a memorandum set forth the topics that the court and counsel had addressed. <em>Heavygun, </em>\u00b6 18. Heavygun could have suffered prejudice if his counsel had failed to raise an affirmative defense or potential objections at the hearing. Heavygun suffered no prejudice, however, as the memorandum reflected the fact that his counsel had raised an affirmative defense and had made motions on his behalf. <em>Heavygun, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 18-19. Heavygun later did not seek to make any motions or raise any defenses that were barred due to a failure by his counsel to have raised them at the hearing. <em>Heavygun, </em>\u00b6 18. This Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>determined that Heavygun had suffered no prejudice based on the partial record of the hearing. <em>Heavygun, </em>\u00b6 19.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-4\">\u00b626 Although we lack a full transcript of the sidebar conference that Wilson did not attend, the record provides sufficient evidence as to the topic of the conference: the alleged bias of potential juror McCarthy. Wilson\u2019s counsel requested the sidebar conference directly after McCarthy had been called for voir dire. The court announced at the conclusion of the sidebar conference that McCarthy had been dismissed by stipulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">\u00b627 Wilson argues that he suffered prejudice due to his inability to have taken part in the discussion regarding whether to stipulate to the removal of McCarthy. This situation differs greatly from <em>Tapson </em>where the court interacted directly with the jury without the defendant or defendant\u2019s counsel present, and without a record. The court in <em>Tapson </em>potentially could have influenced the jury through comments that it made during this unrecorded encounter with the jury. The lack of a record prevented this Court from determining that no possibility of prejudice existed. <em>Tapson, </em>\u00b6 31. Here the record sufficiently demonstrates the nature of the potential prejudice to Wilson. <em>See Heavygun, </em>\u00b6 18. Wilson missed the opportunity to participate in the decision of whether to remove potential juror McCarthy from the jury pool.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-6\">\u00b628  Though he was not present when that discussion occurred, Wilson possesses no right to have any particular juror, including McCarthy, sit as a member of the jury. <em>Taylor, </em>168 Mont, at 146, 542 P.2d at 102. The prosecutor and defense counsel both have the opportunity to use peremptory challenges to remove jurors without cause. <em>Armstrong v. Gondeiro, </em>2000 MT 326, \u00b6 20, 303 Mont. 37, 15 P.3d 386; M. R. Civ. P. 47(b). Either Wilson\u2019s counsel or the prosecutor could have removed McCarthy with a peremptory challenge. This Court determined that no prejudice arose when the court removed empanelled jurors in <em>Kennedy </em>and <em>Price. A </em>greater potential for prejudice exists when a court removes a juror who has sat through a portion of the trial than when a court removes a potential juror before trial. See <em>State v. Pease, </em>222 Mont. 455, 470, 724 P.2d 153, 162 (1986) (describing defendant\u2019s concern that the alternate juror had not been paying attention during the trial).</p>\n<p id=\"b311-7\">\u00b629  Wilson possesses a right to an impartial jury. <em>Taylor, </em>168 Mont, at 146, 542 P.2d at 102. Wilson has not alleged that any member of the jury demonstrated any bias against him. Further, the court\u2019s removal of potential juror McCarthy in no way limited Wilson\u2019s ability <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>to raise challenges for cause or to remove potential jurors with peremptory strikes. Wilson\u2019s claim of prejudice likely would resonate more strongly if the court instead had insisted at the sidebar conference that McCarthy remain in the pool of potential jurors. This scenario likely would have forced Wilson later to exercise a peremptory strike to remove McCarthy. The court removed McCarthy, however, and Wilson retained his full complement of peremptory strikes to remove other potential jurors. McCarthy\u2019s removal did not affect Wilson\u2019s right to a fair and unbiased jury. <em>See Taylor, </em>168 Mont, at 146, 542 P.2d at 102.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-4\">\u00b630 The record sufficiently establishes that the only potential prejudice to Wilson arose from his loss of an opportunity to participate in the decision of whether to keep McCarthy in the potential jury pool. Similar to <em>Kennedy </em>and <em>Price, </em>however, the court mooted this potential prejudice when it announced that McCarthy had been removed from the potential jury pool by stipulation. <em>See Kennedy, </em>\u00b6 34; <em>Price, </em>\u00b6 38. \u00b631 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b312-5\">JUSTICES McKINNON, BAKER, COTTER and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
