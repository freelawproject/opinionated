We affirm the court\u2019s decision to grant Mini Mart\u2019s motion to dismiss, but we set aside the court\u2019s determination of the constitutionality of \u00a7 39-2-915, MCA. Because we find that the court lost its authority to consider Ezzie\u2019s amended complaint once she agreed to arbitration, the court also lost its authority to consider her constitutional challenge.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-4\">ISSUES</p>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">\u00b62 We restate the issues on appeal as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b499-6\">\u00b63 <em>1. Did the District Court err by dismissing Ezzie\u2019s amended complaint for lack of jurisdiction?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b499-7\">\u00b64 <em>2. Did the District Court err in finding that \u00a7 39-2-915, MCA, does not violate Ezzie\u2019s rights to a trial by jury, equal protection of the law, and due process?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b499-8\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b499-9\">\u00b65 Ezzie worked at a Mini Mart store in Great Falls, Montana, for seventeen years. She eventually rose to the level of assistant manager. At some point, Mini Mart introduced a policy stating that it would immediately fire an \u201cassociate\u201d if they failed to ask for a customer loyalty card on two occasions. Mini Mart sent secret shoppers to its stores to test this policy and Ezzie failed to ask one of these shoppers for a loyalty card. Ezzie was consequently fired.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-10\">\u00b66 Ezzie brought a wrongful discharge claim against Mini Mart, Inc. and John Does I-III on May 18, 2011 under Montana\u2019s Wrongful Discharge From Employment Act, \u00a7 39-2-901, <em>et seq., </em>MCA (WDEA). Her complaint demanded a jury trial. Mini Mart offered to arbitrate the dispute pursuant to \u00a7 39-2-914, MCA, on August 8, 2011. Ezzie accepted the offer to arbitrate on August 29, 2011. The letter of acceptance claimed that Ezzie felt compelled to accept the arbitration offer because \u00a7 39-1-915, MCA, would force her to pay Mini Mart\u2019s attorney fees if she declined the offer and later lost at trial.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Notwithstanding her acceptance of the offer to arbitrate, Ezzie also moved to amend her complaint to add destruction of evidence and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>declaratory judgment claims on August 29, 2011. Ezzie\u2019s declaratory judgment claim alleged that \u00a7 39-2-915, MCA, was unconstitutional because it violated her rights to a jury trial, equal protection, and due process. Ezzie essentially argued that because she did not have the financial wherewithal to pay Mini Mart\u2019s attorney fees, she could not risk an adverse judgment at trial and therefore could not exercise her right to a jury trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-4\">\u00b67 The District Court granted Ezzie\u2019s motion to amend her complaint on August 31, 2011, two days after she accepted Mini Mart\u2019s offer to arbitrate the dispute. Ezzie filed her amended complaint on September 2, 2011. Mini Mart moved to dismiss Ezzie\u2019s amended complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction due to her acceptance of the arbitration offer. Ezzie opposed the motion, filed a motion for partial summary judgment on her declaratory judgment claim, and sought a motion to stay the arbitration. The District Court granted the motion to dismiss and vacated its earlier decision allowing amendment of her complaint. The court\u2019s order concluded that it had lost jurisdiction over Ezzie\u2019s claim once she accepted the offer to arbitrate. Without jurisdiction over the WDEA claim, the court reasoned that it could not grant Ezzie leave to amend her complaint. However, the court\u2019s order went on to consider Ezzie\u2019s challenge to \u00a7 39-2-915, MCA, noting the \u201cdilemma\u201d Ezzie faced regarding the appropriate time to raise her constitutional challenge. The court ruled that the statute was constitutional despite its simultaneous recognition that it did not have jurisdiction to consider the allegations contained in Ezzie\u2019s amended complaint. Ezzie appeals both the dismissal of her amended complaint and the determination that \u00a7 39-2-915, MCA, is constitutional. We affirm the dismissal of Ezzie\u2019s amended complaint and set aside the court\u2019s determination of her constitutional claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b500-6\">\u00b68 Whether a court has subject matter jurisdiction is a question of law which we review for correctness. <em>Gazette v. State, </em>2008 MT 287, \u00b6 6, 345 Mont. 385, 190 P.3d 1126. A district court\u2019s interpretation of a statute is reviewed <em>de novo. State v. Hicks, </em>2013 MT 50, \u00b6 14, 369 Mont. 165 (citing <em>State v. Cooksey, </em>2012 MT 226, \u00b6 32, 366 Mont. 346, 286 P.3d 1174; <em>State v. Daniels, </em>2011 MT 278, \u00b6 11, 362 Mont. 426,265 P.3d 623). Our review of constitutional questions is plenary. <em>Alexander v. Bozeman Motors, Inc., </em>2010 MT 135, \u00b6 16, 356 Mont. 439, 234 P.3d 880.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b501-4\">\u00b69 Mini Mart initially contends that the District Court\u2019s order is not appealable under the Montana Rules of Appellate Procedure. Mini Mart claims that M. R. App. P. 6(3)\u2019s \u201cexhaustive\u201d list of appealable orders in civil cases does not allow for an appeal from an order granting a motion to dismiss or denying a motion for partial summary judgment. Ezzie counters that our decision in <em>Prentice Lumber Company, Inc.v. Hukill, </em>161 Mont. 8, 504 P.2d 277 (1972), allows for her appeal of the District Court\u2019s order and claims that denying her appeal would foreclose her ability to seek review of the court\u2019s order dismissing her claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-5\">\u00b610 Ezzie\u2019s appeal does not fall within the list of civil appeals allowed under Rule 6(3). However, her appeal does not fall within Rule 6(5)\u2019s list of orders and judgments that are not appealable, either. Rule 6(5)(b) declares that \u201cOrders denying motions for summary judgment or motions to dismiss, or granting partial summary judgment\u201d are not appealable, but Ezzie appeals an order <em>granting </em>a motion to dismiss and <em>denying </em>partial summary judgment. Moreover, as Ezzie points out, we have previously found that this court \u201chas recently rendered decisions on the merits in appeals from orders dismissing complaints.\u201d <em>Prentice Lumber Company, Inc., </em>161 Mont, at 12. This is because we determined that the effect of a court\u2019s order denying leave to amend the complaint and dismissing the cause of action was \u201csubstantially the same as a judgment for defendants.\u201d <em>Prentice Lumber Company, Inc., </em>161 Mont, at 12. We therefore held that \u201can order dismissing a complaint and denying leave to amend is equivalent to a final judgment for purposes of appeal.\u201d <em>Prentice Lumber Company, </em>Inc., 161 Mont, at 13. The District Court\u2019s order in the present case vacated its prior order granting Ezzie leave to amend her complaint and dismissed her claims for destruction of the evidence and declaratory judgment. Because the court\u2019s order denied Ezzie relief on her additional claims just as if judgment had been entered against her, we find that the District Court\u2019s order is appealable. <em>See also Burchett v. MasTec N. Am., Inc., </em>2004 MT 177, 322 Mont. 93, 93 P.3d 1247 (reviewing a district court\u2019s grant of a motion to dismiss a claim under the WDEA for lack of subject matter jurisdiction); <em>Tobacco River Lumber Co. v. Yoppe, </em>176 Mont. 267, 269-70, 577 P.2d 855 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b501-6\">\u00b611 <em>1. Did the District Court err by dismissing Ezzie\u2019s amended complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b501-7\">\u00b612 Section 39-2-914(5), MCA, the arbitration provision of the WDEA, declares that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>[i]f a valid offer to arbitrate is made and accepted, arbitration is the exclusive remedy for the wrongful discharge dispute and there is no right to bring or continue a lawsuit under this part. The arbitrator\u2019s award is final and binding, subject to review of the arbitrator\u2019s decision under the provisions of the Uniform Arbitration Act.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b502-4\">The District Court determined that, pursuant to \u00a7 39-2-914(5), MCA, and our decisions in <em>Dahl </em>and <em>Burkhart, </em>it did not have subject matter jurisdiction to either amend Ezzie\u2019s complaint or hear her additional claims once she accepted Mini Mart\u2019s offer to arbitrate.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">\u00b613 On appeal, Ezzie argues that the District Court did not lose jurisdiction over her claims for destruction of evidence or declaratory judgment when she accepted Mini Mart\u2019s offer to arbitrate her WDEA claim. Ezzie specifically argues that the language of \u00a7 39-2-914(5), MCA, is limited to wrongful discharge disputes, and that her claims for destruction of the evidence and declaratory judgment are not subject to the statute because they are not, and are not based on, wrongful discharge claims. Ezzie relies on our decisions in <em>Beasley v. Semitool, Inc., </em>258 Mont. 258, 853 P.2d 84 (1993); <em>Dahl v. Fred Myer Inc., </em>1999 MT 285, 297 Mont. 28, 993 P.2d 6; and <em>Burkhart v. Semitool, Inc., </em>2000 MT 201, 300 Mont. 480, 5 P.3d 1031, for support.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-6\">\u00b614 Mini Mart counters that the District Court correctly granted its motion to dismiss Ezzie\u2019s amended complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction because the WDEA removed the court\u2019s power to continue to hear the case once Ezzie accepted the offer to arbitrate. In essence, Mini Mart claims that the court couldn\u2019t even entertain Ezzie\u2019s later, additional claims because her wrongful discharge claim came under the operation of \u00a7 39-2-914(5), MCA, when she accepted arbitration. <em>See Burkhart, </em>\u00b6 21 (\u201cThe plain language of \u00a7 39-2-914(5), MCA, clearly provides that once an offer to arbitrate has been accepted, neither the district court nor the parties have a right to continue the lawsuit.\u201d). Thus, Mini Mart\u2019s argument does not hinge on whether Ezzie\u2019s claims are so intertwined with her wrongful discharge claim as to fall within the ambit of \u00a7 39-2-914(5), MCA. Rather, Mini Mart argues that because Ezzie\u2019s agreement to arbitrate preceded the amendment of her complaint, the court lost its authority to hear her claim from that point forward, except pursuant to its authority under the Uniform Arbitration Act, Title 27, chapter 5 of the Montana Code. <em>See </em>Section 39-2-914(5), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-7\">\u00b615 Initially, Ezzie\u2019s citation to <em>Beasley </em>is misplaced. In <em>Beasley, </em>we considered whether a district court erred by concluding that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>WDEA barred a plaintiffs claims for breach of contract and breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing. The district court concluded that the WDEA barred the additional contract and good faith claims based on its reading of \u00a7 39-2-913, MCA, which provides that \u201c[ejxcept as provided in this part, no claim for discharge may arise from tort or express or implied contract.\u201d While we reversed the district court\u2019s decision, finding that the language of \u00a7 39-2-913, MCA, did not \u201cbar all tort or contract claims merely because they arise in the employment context,\u201d neither this holding nor the facts of the case are relevant to the current appeal. <em>Beasley, </em>258 Mont, at 261-262. We did not consider the WDEA\u2019s arbitration provision, the district court\u2019s decision did not turn upon it, and a court\u2019s continuing jurisdiction over WDEA claims submitted to arbitration was not at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-4\">\u00b616 However, we did consider the effect of \u00a7 39-2-914, MCA, in <em>Burkhart </em>and <em>Dahl. </em>In <em>Dahl, </em>the plaintiff filed a WDEA claim alleging he was discharged without good cause and contrary to the defendant\u2019s written personnel policy. <em>Dahl, </em>\u00b6 3. Prior to the arbitration hearing, the defendant moved to dismiss the arbitration, claiming that the complaint actually stated a claim under federal law. The arbitrator agreed and dismissed the arbitration. <em>Dahl, </em>\u00b6 4. The plaintiff then asked the district court for leave to amend his complaint to remove the portions raising a federal claim. The court did not rule on the motion to amend and instead issued an order confirming the arbitrator\u2019s decision. <em>Dahl, </em>\u00b6 13. The plaintiff alleged that this was error on appeal, and argued that the court should have granted his motion to amend his complaint and start over with a state law claim. <em>Dahl, </em>\u00b6 14. We held that \u201c[t]he District Court lost jurisdiction when the parties agreed to arbitration, and therefore, did not have authority to allow Appellant to amend his complaint,\u201d citing \u00a7 39-2-914, MCA. <em>Dahl, </em>\u00b6 15.</p>\n<p id=\"A8N\">\u00b617 In <em>Burkhart, </em>the Plaintiff in a wrongful discharge case agreed to submit just the WDEA claims to arbitration pursuant to \u00a7 39-2-914, MCA. The defendant then filed a motion to dismiss all of the plaintiffs claims, WDEA and non-WDEA, or compel arbitration on all of the claims. The court dismissed all of the plaintiffs claims. <em>Burkhart, </em>\u00b6 11. On appeal, the plaintiff argued that the district court erred because it no longer retained jurisdiction over the WDEA claims submitted to arbitration. We found \u00a7 39-2-914(5), MCA, to be controlling, and concluded that \u201cthe plain language\u201d of the section \u201cclearly provides that once an offer to arbitrate has been accepted, neither the district court nor the parties have a right to continue the lawsuit.\u201d <em>Burkhart, </em>\u00b6 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>\u00b618  At the time Ezzie agreed to arbitrate, her complaint consisted only of a WDEA-based claim for wrongful discharge. Arbitration became the exclusive remedy for this WDEA claim once Ezzie agreed to arbitrate. Section 39-2-914(5), MCA. As <em>Burkhart </em>instructs, once an offer to arbitrate has been accepted, \u201cneither the district court nor the parties have a right to continue the lawsuit.\u201d <em>Burkhart, </em>\u00b6 21. Thus, regardless of what the proposed amendments to the complaint sought to accomplish, the court was without authority to continue its consideration of the case. The court regains its authority over the case following arbitration, and may review the arbitrator\u2019s decision under the Uniform Arbitration Act. Section 39-2-914(5), MCA. We accordingly affirm the District Court\u2019s dismissal of Ezzie\u2019s additional destruction of evidence and declaratory judgment claims prior to arbitration of the WDEA claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-4\">\u00b619 <em>2. Did the District Court err in finding that \u00a7 39-2-915, MCA, does not violate Ezzie\u2019s rights to a trial by jury, equal protection of the law, and due process?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">\u00b620 While we sympathize with the court\u2019s effort to address Ezzie\u2019s constitutional dilemma, we conclude, as we did above, that once Ezzie agreed to arbitrate, the District Court lost its authority to act further, and, thus, it could not, and should not have, considered Ezzie\u2019s constitutional claim. Ezzie\u2019s WDEA claim had been submitted to arbitration by operation of \u00a7 39-2-914(5), MCA, prior to the amendment of her claim, and the court could neither amend Ezzie\u2019s complaint nor consider the claims Ezzie sought to add. <em>Burkhart, </em>\u00b6 21. We consequently set aside the court\u2019s determination of the merits of Ezzie\u2019s constitutional claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b504-7\">\u00b621 Because we find that the court lost its ability to consider Ezzie\u2019s claim once she agreed to arbitration, we affirm the court\u2019s dismissal of her amended complaint without prejudice and set aside its determination of the merits of her constitutional claim.</p>\n<judges id=\"b504-8\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES BAKER, COTTER and MORRIS concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b499-11\"> Section 39-2-914, MCA, allows a party to make a written offer to arbitrate a dispute that arises under the WDEA.
