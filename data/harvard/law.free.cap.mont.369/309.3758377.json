(Benefis) appeals several orders of the Eighth Judicial District Court, Cascade County, issued in an individual and class action lawsuit filed against Benefis by Shannon Conway (Conway). First, Benefis alleges that the District Court improperly converted Conway\u2019s motion for judgment on the pleadings into a motion for summary judgment. Next, Benefis challenges the District Court\u2019s grant of summary judgment on Conway\u2019s individual breach of contract claims. Lastly, Benefis appeals from the District Court\u2019s order certifying the matter as a class action. We affirm the District Court\u2019s conversion of the motion for judgment on the pleadings to a motion for summary judgment and reverse the District Court\u2019s order of summary judgment. Based on our reversal of summary judgment, we do not reach the class certification issue. We affirm in part and reverse in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-10\">ISSUES</p>\n<p id=\"b332-11\">\u00b62 Benefis raises the following three issues on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b332-12\">\u00b63 1. Did the District Court err in converting Conway\u2019s motion for</p>\n<p id=\"b332-13\">judgment on the pleadings to a motion for summary judgment?</p>\n<p id=\"b332-14\">\u00b64 2. Did the District Court err in granting summary judgment to Conway?</p>\n<p id=\"b332-15\">\u00b65 3. Did the District Court err in granting Conway\u2019s motion to certify the class?</p>\n<p id=\"b332-16\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b332-17\">\u00b66 On November 6, 2009, Conway was injured in an automobile accident and received medical treatment at Benefis. Conway had healthcare coverage as a TRICARE beneficiary and also had medical payments coverage through his automobile insurance carrier, Kemper. TRICARE is a Department of Defense healthcare benefits program <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>that is regionally administered by TriWest Healthcare Alliance (TriWest). TRICARE provides benefits to members of the military and their families. TriWest employed Blue Cross Blue Shield, Inc. (BCBS) as a network subcontractor to establish a provider network. BCBS entered into a preferred provider agreement (PPA) with Benefis.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-3\">\u00b67 Conway\u2019s medical treatment costs totaled $2,073.65. Benefis billed TriWest, Kemper, and other insurers for this amount. Benefis received payment from TRICARE on January 26, 2010. Benefis accepted $662.74 from TRICARE as payment in full satisfaction of the bill. Benefis accepted this reduced amount pursuant to the PPA between BCBS and Benefis, which provided in pertinent part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-4\">Provider agrees to treat TRICARE Beneficiaries according to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and in accordance with all applicable laws, rules and regulations pertaining to TRICARE including, but not limited to, the TRICARE manuals and the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR). Provider shall accept the Reimbursement Rates (less the amount of any Copayments payable by the TRICARE Beneficiary) as the only payment expected from TriWest and TRICARE Beneficiaries for Covered Services, and for all services paid for by the TRICARE program. TRICARE Beneficiaries are responsible only for Copayments. The Reimbursement Rates shall apply to Active Duty and civilian claims, to enrollees and to non-enrollees, and to all TRICARE Beneficiaries whose care is reimbursed by the Department of Defense, regardless of their residence. In no event will Provider be paid for such services more than the TRICARE/CHAMPUS Maximum Allowable Charge (CMAC) or applicable TRICARE DRG rate or what is permissible under Federal law or TRICARE policy.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">On February 4, 2010, Benefis received payment of $1,866.29 from Kemper. Upon receiving payment from Kemper, Benefis reimbursed TRICARE\u2019s payment in full. As is the case with Medicaid and Medicare programs, TRICARE functions as a secondary payer.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-6\">\u00b68 On December 9,2010, Conway filed his individual and class action complaint. Conway claimed that he was entitled to the additional $1,203.55 that Benefis received from Kemper over and above the TRICARE reimbursement rate. The complaint alleged individual and class action claims against Benefis for breach of contract, breach of third party beneficiary contract, and intentional interference with contractual relations. The complaint also included individual claims of fraud and violation of Montana\u2019s Consumer Protection Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>\u00b69 On January 14, 2011, Benefis filed a notice of removal of the action to the United States District Court for the District of Montana, Great Falls Division, on the basis of federal subject matter jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1441(b) and (c). On March 2, 2011, the federal court determined that there was no basis for federal jurisdiction and granted Conway\u2019s motion to remand the case back to Montana\u2019s Eighth Judicial District Court, Cascade County.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-4\">\u00b610 On March 25, 2011, Conway filed a motion requesting that the District Court issue an order certifying the matter as a class action pursuant to M. R. Civ. P. 23. Conway asserted that Benefis has entered into multiple agreements with health insurers to accept reduced payments for medical services, and that it then violates those contracts by accepting payments in full from third party insurers. Conway sought certification of a class to include \u201call persons who are Benefis patients and insureds and/or beneficiaries of TRICARE, BCBSMT, or other health insurers and from whom Benefis has accepted payments in excess of the predetermined and previously agreed upon \u2018reimbursement rate.\u2019 \u201d Benefis opposed Conway\u2019s motion for an order certifying the class.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">\u00b611 On April 25, 2011, Conway filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings pursuant to M. R. Civ. P. 12(c). Conway asked the District Court to find that Benefis breached its contract with TRICARE<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and that Benefis was liable for Conway\u2019s damages caused by the breach as a matter of law. Conway asserted that Benefis had admitted in its answer each fact necessary to conclude that it had breached the contract. Benefis countered that judgment on the pleadings was not appropriate because it had raised several affirmative defenses and challenged many of Conway\u2019s assertions that were central to his breach of contract claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-6\">\u00b612 After the motion was fully briefed, the District Court issued an order on August 25,2011. First, the District Court converted the Rule 12(c) motion into a M. R. Civ. P. 56 motion for summary judgment so that it could consider documents outside the pleadings in reaching a decision. Specifically, the District Court considered the PPA, which had been attached to Benefis\u2019 response brief. The District Court reviewed the language of the PPA and determined that Conway was an intended beneficiary of the PPA. Next, the District Court granted summary judgment in favor of Conway and concluded that Benefis <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>breached the PPA by accepting more money for its services than the maximum allowable charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-3\">\u00b613 On December 1, 2011, Benefis petitioned this Court for a writ of supervisory control. Benefis sought review of the District Court\u2019s conversion of the motion for judgment on the pleadings to a motion for summary judgment and the District Court\u2019s grant of partial summary judgment in favor of Conway on his individual breach of contract claims. We denied Benefis\u2019 petition for supervisory control on January 18, 2012, concluding that Benefis failed to establish urgency or emergency factors that would render the normal appeal process inadequate.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-4\">\u00b614 The District Court held oral argument on Conway\u2019s motion to certify the class on November 16,2011. The District Court awaited this Court\u2019s decision on Benefis\u2019 petition for a writ of supervisory control before issuing its order on class certification. On March 7, 2012, the District Court issued an order granting Conway\u2019s motion to certify the class. The District Court determined that Conway satisfied the four prerequisites set forth in Rule 23(a): (1) numerosity; (2) commonality; (3) typicality; and (4) adequacy of representation. Next, the District Court concluded that class certification was appropriate under Rule 23(b)(3) because it was \u201cclearly desirable to concentrate the litigation of the claims in this forum and the difficulties of managing the litigation are comparatively minor.\u201d Since the fundamental issue in the litigation involved recovery of the excess payments collected by Benefis, the District Court reasoned that once all the data was collected, the matter could be resolved by mathematical calculation.</p>\n<p id=\"AWD\">\u00b615 On May 4,2012, the District Court entered final judgment on the conversion of the motion for judgment on the pleadings to a motion for summary judgment, the entry of summary judgment on Conway\u2019s individual breach of contract claims, and the certification of the class. Benefis appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">STANDARDS OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b335-6\">\u00b616 Since a motion for judgment on the pleadings is decided as a matter of law, we review a district court\u2019s decision for correctness. <em>Ritter v. Bill Barrett </em>Corp., 2009 MT 210, \u00b6 10, 351 Mont. 278, 210 P.3d 688; <em>Nelson v. Barlow, </em>2008 MT 68, \u00b6 9, 342 Mont. 93, 179 P.3d 529.</p>\n<p id=\"AAX\">\u00b617 We review a district court\u2019s ruling on a motion for summary judgment de novo, applying the same criteria of M. R. Civ. P. 56 as did the district court. <em>Reichert v. State, </em>2012 MT 111, \u00b6 18, 365 Mont. 92, 278 P.3d 455; <em>Shattuck v. Kalispell Reg\u2019l Med. Ctr., </em>2011 MT 229, \u00b6 8, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>362 Mont. 100,261 P.3d 1021. Summary-judgment \u201cshould be rendered if the pleadings, the discovery- and disclosure materials on file, and any affidavits show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d M. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b336-4\">\u00b618 We review a district court\u2019s decision on a motion for class certification for an abuse of discretion. <em>LaMere v. Farmers Ins. Exch., </em>2011 MT 272, \u00b6 14, 362 Mont. 379, 265 P.3d 617; <em>Hop v. Safeco Ins. Co., </em>2011 MT 215, \u00b6 9, 361 Mont. 510, 261 P.3d 981.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b336-6\">\u00b619 <em>Did the District Court err in converting Conway\u2019s motion for judgment on the pleadings to a motion for summary judgment </em>?</p>\n<p id=\"b336-7\">\u00b620 Conway\u2019s motion for ajudgment on the pleadings, and the District Court\u2019s subsequent conversion of the motion to a motion for summary judgment, is governed by M. R. Civ. P. 12(c) and (d), which provide as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-8\">(c) Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings. After the pleadings are closed-but early enough not to delay trial-a party may move for judgment on the pleadings.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-9\">(d) Result of Presenting Matters outside the Pleadings. If, on a motion under Rule 12(b)(6) or 12(c), matters outside the pleadings are presented to and not excluded by the court, the motion must be treated as one for summary judgment under Rule 56. All parties must be given a reasonable opportunity to present all the material that is pertinent to the motion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b336-11\">A party moving for judgment on the pleadings pursuant to Rule 12(c) must establish that no issues of fact exist and that it is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>Curtis v. Citibank, </em>2011 MT 247, \u00b6 6, 362 Mont. 211, 261 P.3d 1059; <em>Ritter, </em>\u00b6 10. A court must assume that all of the well-pleaded factual allegations in the nonmovant\u2019s pleadings are true and that all contravening assertions in the movant\u2019s pleadings are false when evaluating a Rule 12(c) motion. <em>Curtis, </em>\u00b6 6; <em>Firelight Meadows, LLC v. 3 Rivers Telephone Coop., Inc., </em>2008 MT 202, \u00b6 11, 344 Mont. 117, 186 P.3d 869. A motion for judgment on the pleadings is appropriate in situations where all material allegations of fact are admitted or not controverted in the pleadings, and only questions of law remain to be decided by the court. <em>Curtis, </em>\u00b6 6; <em>Firelight Meadows, </em>\u00b610.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-12\">\u00b621 This Court has previously held that Rule 12(c) requires only that a party be given a \u201creasonable opportunity\u201d to present material <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>pertinent to a motion for summary judgment. <em>See Rafanelli v. Dale, </em>1998 MT 331, \u00b6 22, 292 Mont. 277, 971 P.2d 371; <em>Bretz v. Ayers, </em>232 Mont. 132, 136, 756 P.2d 1115, 1118 (1988). A litigant has a \u201creasonable opportunity\u201d if he is \u201cfairly apprised\u201d that the court may consider other documents and treat the motion for judgment on the pleadings as a motion for summary judgment. <em>Rafanelli, </em>\u00b6 22; <em>Bretz, </em>232 Mont, at 136, 756 P.2d at 1118.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-3\">\u00b622 In <em>Rafanelli, </em>the non-moving party responded to a motion for judgment on the pleadings by requesting that the district court take judicial notice of the pleadings from an earlier case. <em>Rafanelli, </em>\u00b6 20. The district court took judicial notice of the earlier case and converted the motion to a motion for summary judgment because it had considered matters outside the pleadings. <em>Rafanelli, </em>\u00b6 20. The non-moving party argued that the district court erred in converting the motion because it did not provide him with a reasonable opportunity to present other pertinent materials and he had no notice of what matters the district court would rely on in reaching its decision. <em>Rafanelli, </em>\u00b6 21. We held that the district court did not err because the non-moving party who was challenging the conversion of the motion was the same party that had requested that the court consider matters outside the pleadings. <em>Rafanelli, </em>\u00b6 23.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-4\">\u00b623 In <em>Bretz, </em>we upheld a district court\u2019s conversion of a M. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> motion to dismiss to a motion for summary judgment under circumstances similar to those in the instant case. Bretz attached eleven documents to his response brief opposing the motion to dismiss and referred to the contents of those documents throughout his brief. <em>Bretz, </em>232 Mont, at 135, 756 P.2d at 1117. Since Bretz himself had introduced the additional documents and invited the district court to consider them, we determined that he was fairly apprised that the court could treat the motion as a motion for summary judgment, and he had a reasonable opportunity to present pertinent material to the court. <em>Bretz, </em>232 Mont, at 136, 756 P.2d at 1118.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>\u00b624 Here, Conway filed the motion for judgment on the pleadings. Benefis attached the PPA to its response brief in opposition to the motion. Benefis specifically requested that the District Court base its decision on the language and contents of the PPA. Benefis stated in its brief that the District Court \u201cmust examine the contract which forms the basis of Plaintiffs breach of contract claim in its entirety prior to considering the merits of Plaintiffs breach of contract claim, so that contract is attached to this Response as Exhibit 1.\u201d Relying on <em>Rafanelli </em>and <em>Bretz, </em>we will not allow Benefis to attach documents outside the pleadings and encourage the District Court to consider those documents, and then later claim that it was not \u201cfairly apprised\u201d that the District Court would be required to convert the motion for a judgment on the pleadings to a motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-4\">\u00b625 Benefis argues that <em>Firelight Meadows </em>controls the outcome of this case because the PPA was a part of the pleadings. In <em>Firelight Meadows, </em>the plaintiff attached a contract to its complaint. <em>Firelight Meadows, </em>\u00b6 5. The defendant filed an answer and later filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings. <em>Firelight Meadows, </em>\u00b6 6. The district court granted the defendant\u2019s motion, and the plaintiff appealed contending that the district court failed to provide it with notice and an opportunity to present additional materials. <em>Firelight Meadows, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 7-8. This Court held that the district court did not improperly consider matters outside the pleadings because the agreement attached to the complaint was a part of the pleadings pursuant to M. R. Civ. P. 10(c), which provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b338-5\">Adoption by Reference; Exhibits. A statement in a pleading may be adopted by reference elsewhere in the same pleading or in any other pleading or motion. A copy of a written instrument that is an exhibit to a pleading is a part of the pleading for all purposes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b338-6\"><em>Firelight Meadows, </em>\u00b6 15. Since the agreement was appended to and referenced in the plaintiffs complaint, it constituted part of the pleadings. <em>Firelight Meadows, </em>\u00b6 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-7\">\u00b626 Unlike <em>Firelight Meadows, </em>the PPA was not attached to any of the parties\u2019 pleadings. Instead, the PPA was attached as an exhibit to Benefis\u2019 response brief to Conway\u2019s motion for judgment on the pleadings. Rule 10(c) incorporates into the pleadings \u201ca written instrument that is an exhibit to a <em>pleading.\u201d </em>M. R. Civ. P. 10(c) (emphasis added). Here, since the PPA was not attached as an exhibit to a pleading, Rule 10(c) is inapplicable and our holding in <em>Firelight Meadows </em>is not controlling.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>\u00b627 Our review of the record also demonstrates that during a July 20, 2011 hearing on a separate motion, the District Court asked counsel for both parties if they desired a hearing on any pending motions, including Conway\u2019s motion for judgment on the pleadings. Benefis represented to the District Court that all of the pending motions could be determined on the briefs. At this point in the litigation, Benefis had already received Conway\u2019s reply brief on the motion for judgment on the pleadings, in which he asserted that Benefis\u2019 attachment of the PPA effectively converted the motion to a motion for summary judgment. Benefis opted to forego oral argument and registered no objection to Conway\u2019s assertion that the matter had been converted to a summary judgment determination. Under these circumstances, Benefis cannot claim that it was unaware that the District Court might convert the motion to a motion for summary judgment, nor can it claim that it had no reasonable opportunity to present additional pertinent material.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-3\">\u00b628  Accordingly, we hold that the District Court did not err in converting Conway\u2019s Rule 12(c) motion for judgment on the pleadings into a motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-4\">\u00b629 <em>Did the District Court err in granting summary judgment to Conway?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">\u00b630 After the District Court converted Conway\u2019s motion for judgment on the pleading into a motion for summary judgment, it granted summary judgment in favor of Conway on his individual breach of contract claims. First, the District Court determined that Conway was an intended third party beneficiary of the PPA. Second, the District Court concluded that Benefis breached the PPA by accepting payment from Kemper in excess of the TRICARE reimbursement rate. Benefis maintains that Conway is not a third party beneficiary, did not suffer any damages, and lacks standing to bring his claims. Furthermore, Benefis asserts that it was entitled to accept payments from Kemper in excess of the TRICARE reimbursement rate.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-6\">\u00b631 We begin our analysis of Conway\u2019s breach of contract claims with an examination of the pertinent language of the PPA. Again, the PPA provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-7\">Provider agrees to treat TRICARE Beneficiaries according to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and in accordance with all applicable laws, rules and regulations pertaining to TRICARE including, but not limited to, the TRICARE manuals and the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR). Provider shall accept the Reimbursement Rates (less the amount of any Copayments <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>payable by the TRICARE Beneficiary) as the only payment expected from TriWest and TRICARE Beneficiaries for Covered Services, and for all services paid for by the TRICARE program. TRICARE Beneficiaries are responsible only for Copayments. The Reimbursement Rates shall apply to Active Duty and civilian claims, to enrollees and to non-enrollees, and to all TRICARE Beneficiaries whose care is reimbursed by the Department of Defense, regardless of their residence. In no event will Provider be paid for such services more than the TRICARE/CHAMPUS Maximum Allowable Charge (CMAC) or applicable TRICARE DRG rate or what is permissible under Federal law or TRICARE policy.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b340-4\">The PPA governs payments made by TRICARE to Benefis for \u201cCovered Services.\u201d The PPA defines \u201cCovered Services\u201d as: \u201cServices, items and supplies for which benefits are available to TRICARE Beneficiaries in accordance with the rules, regulations, policies and instructions of TRICARE Management Activity.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">\u00b632 Benefis and amicus curiae argue that the medical services Conway received were not \u201cCovered Services\u201d as defined in the PPA. As noted by the District Court, federal regulations mandate that TRICARE functions as a secondary payer. 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 199.8(a). In situations where the medical treatment at issue is necessitated as a result of the negligence of an insured third party, any payment originally made by TRICARE must be reimbursed. <em>See </em>32 C.F.R. \u00a7 199.8(a), (b)(3). No TRICARE benefits are available to a TRICARE beneficiary where there is third party insurance available to pay the expenses of medical treatment. It is only where there is no such available third party coverage that the services become \u201cCovered Services\u201d under the PPA. While Benefis is required under the PPA to accept the TRICARE rates for \u201cCovered Services,\u201d nothing in the PPA prohibits Benefis from accepting a greater amount from the responsible insurer, in this case Kemper. Kemper is a stranger to the PPA. As such, the rates at which Kemper reimburses Benefis are not dictated by the PPA.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-6\">\u00b633 Central to Conway\u2019s breach of contract claims is his assertion that he is owed the difference between the $1,866.29 Benefis accepted from Kemper and the $662.74 paid by TRICARE pursuant to the PPA. Conway contends that he was entitled to recover this $1,203.55 as damages. However, the nature of medical payments coverage and the facts of this case do not support Conway\u2019s assertions that he is entitled to recover the alleged damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>\u00b634 This Court\u2019s decision in <em>Newbury v. State Farm Fire &amp; Cas. Ins. Co., </em>2008 MT 156, 343 Mont. 279, 184 P.3d 1021, is instructive. In <em>Newbury, </em>the plaintiff was a snowplow driver who was injured while attempting to assist a driver stuck in a ditch. <em>Newbury, </em>\u00b6 7. The plaintiff incurred medical expenses totaling $18,405. <em>Newbury, </em>\u00b6 8. The plaintiff filed a workers\u2019 compensation claim and the State Fund paid all but $1,175 of his medical expenses. <em>Newbury, </em>\u00b6 8. The plaintiff submitted a claim to his automobile insurance provider, State Farm, requesting payment of the full $10,000 medical payment coverage limits. <em>Newbury, </em>\u00b6 10. State Farm paid the remaining medical expenses of $1,175. <em>Newbury, </em>\u00b6 10. The plaintiff filed suit against State Farm, seeking additional payment under his medical payment coverage, even though his medical bills had been fully paid. <em>Newbury, </em>\u00b6 11. We determined that \u201cwhile it was reasonable for Newbury to expect that his State Farm policies would pay his medical expenses (up to the policy limits of $ 10,000.00) once the State Fund had paid all it was required to pay, it was not reasonable for Newbury to expect to receive funds in excess of his medical expenses.\u201d <em>Newbury, </em>\u00b6 38. This Court recognized that medical payment benefits are payable only for medical expenses, and the undisputed facts demonstrated that the plaintiff received full payment of his medical expenses and owed nothing more to his healthcare providers. <em>Newbury, </em>\u00b6 39. We ultimately upheld State Farm\u2019s refusal to pay more than the medical expenses actually incurred because a windfall would result if the plaintiff were to receive additional money under his medical payments coverage in excess of his total medical expenses. <em>Newbury, </em>\u00b6 47.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-3\">\u00b635 Here, the record shows that Benefis accepted Kemper\u2019s payment of $1,866.29 as payment in full for the actual cost of Conway\u2019s medical treatment that resulted from the accident. Conway does not owe Benefis any remaining amount. Even though all of Conway\u2019s medical expenses have been paid, he still seeks to pocket $1,203.55 in medical payments coverage benefits, representing the difference between Kemper\u2019s payment to Benefis and the TRICARE reimbursement rate. We disagree. Conway is no more entitled to pocket excess medical payments here than he would be under the circumstances in <em>Newbury, </em>or any other situation in which all of his medical expenses are paid by his insurer under its medical payments coverage. Although the circumstances of this case are somewhat complicated by the PPA situation, this does not alter the basic premise that medical payments coverage is for the payment of medical expenses only; it does not provide for the payment of additional or excess sums to the insured. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>The District Court\u2019s order of summary judgment wrongly endorses the type of windfall recovery expressly disapproved in <em>Newbury.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b342-4\">\u00b636 Conway claims and the District Court concluded that Conway was an intended beneficiary of the PPA. In light of our resolution here on alternate grounds, we need not address the correctness of this ruling. However, even if we were to consider Conway an intended beneficiary of the PPA, he still could establish no entitlement to damages from Benefis.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">\u00b637 In determining damages for a breach of contract action, Montana law provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-6\">Breach of contract. For the breach of an obligation arising from contract, the measure of damages, except when otherwise expressly provided by this code, is the amount which will compensate the party aggrieved for all the detriment which was proximately caused thereby or in the ordinary course of things would be likely to result therefrom. Damages which are not clearly ascertainable in both their nature and origin cannot be recovered for a breach of contract.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b342-7\">Section 27-1-311, MCA. Furthermore, \u201c[a] person may not recover a greater amount in damages for the breach of an obligation than the person could have gained by the full performance of the obligation on both sides unless a greater recovery is specified by statute.\u201d Section 27-1-303, MCA. Pursuant to these statutes governing the measure of damages for breach of contract actions, the undisputed facts reveal that Conway suffered no loss or harm due to Benefis\u2019 actions. Regardless of the difference between what Kemper paid and what Benefis was contractually entitled to accept, the record shows that Conway\u2019s medical bills were paid in full and he was not personally entitled to receive any additional payments directly from Kemper under his medical payments coverage. This being so, he cannot by extension establish that Benefis must pay to him the money Kemper paid to it for medical expenses. Benefis simply has not proximately caused any damages to Conway. Therefore, Conway has failed to demonstrate that he suffered a compensable injury as a result of Benefis\u2019 purported breach of contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-8\">\u00b638  n light of our conclusions that Conway is not entitled to pocket the difference between the TRICARE reimbursement rate and the amount Benefis accepted from Kemper, and that Conway has failed to establish any damages that resulted from the alleged breach, the District Court\u2019s grant of summary judgment was improper. We therefore hold that the District Court erred in granting summary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>judgment to Conway. Notably, we do not address here whether and under what circumstances Benefis is entitled to retain the full payment for medical expenses in those situations where PPAs are in play, as that is not the issue before us. We determine only that Conway is not entitled to recover these sums.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-3\">\u00b639 Based on our resolution of this issue, it is unnecessary to reach the District Court\u2019s grant of Conway\u2019s motion to certify the class. The District Court\u2019s decision to certify the matter as a class action was premised on its conclusion that Conway was entitled to judgment as a matter of law on his breach of contract claims, and could therefore represent others with similar claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-4\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">\u00b640 For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the District Court\u2019s conversion of Conway\u2019s motion for judgment on the pleadings to a motion for summary judgment, but reverse the District Court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of Conway.</p>\n<judges id=\"b343-6\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES BAKER, McKINNON and RICE concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b334-7\"> No contract actually existed between Benefis and TRICARE.
