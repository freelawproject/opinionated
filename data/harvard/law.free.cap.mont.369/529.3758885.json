(Berry\u2019s) disclaimed implied warranties for a used vehicle sold to Payne. Although we conclude that Berry\u2019s failed to effectively disclaim implied warranties on the vehicle, we nonetheless affirm the District Court on alternate grounds. We address the following issues:</p>\n<p id=\"b552-9\">\u00b62 <em>1. Did Berry\u2019s effectively disclaim implied warranties of a used vehicle under \u00a7 30-2-316, MCA, when the transaction included purchase of a service contract for the vehicle ?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b552-10\">\u00b63 <em>2. Did the District Court err by affirming the Justice Court\u2019s denial of Payne\u2019s implied warranty claim?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b552-11\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b552-12\">\u00b64 Payne, a resident of Dawson County, purchased a used 1997 Ford Explorer from Berry\u2019s in Billings on September 4, 2007. Payne also purchased an extended service contract for the vehicle for an additional cost of $1,870.00. Payne signed several transactional documents, including the Buyer\u2019s Guide, the Retail Installment Contract, the Retail Purchase Agreement, and the Extended Service Contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-13\">\u00b65 The Buyer\u2019s Guide is a double-sided form designed to be affixed to the window of a used vehicle offered for sale and identifies the subject 1997 Ford Explorer. A section of the Buyer\u2019s Guide is labeled \u201cWarranties for this Vehicle\u201d and sets forth various statements about the transaction that are placed beside boxes to be checked if the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>statement is applicable. The first statement reads: \u201cAS IS - NO WARRANTY. YOU WILL PAY FOR ALL COSTS FOR ANY REPAIRS. The dealer assumes no responsibility for any repairs regardless of any oral statements about the vehicle.\u201d The box next to this statement was checked. Boxes next to statements describing full and limited warranties were not checked. However, the box next to the following statement was checked: \u201cSERVICE CONTRACT: A service contract is available at an extra charge on this vehicle. Ask for details as to coverage, deductible, price, and exclusions. <em>If you buy a service contract within 90 days of the time of sale, state law \u2018implied warranties\u2019 may give you additional rights.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b553-4\">\u00b66 The Retail Installment Contract and the Retail Purchase Agreement contain similar statements addressing warranties. The Retail Installment Contract reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b553-5\">Warranties Seller Disclaims. You understand that the seller is not offering any warranties and that there are no implied warranties of merchantability, of fitness for a particular purpose, or any other warranties, express or implied by the seller, covering the vehicle unless the seller extends a written warranty or service contract within 90 days from the date of this contract.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b553-6\">The Retail Purchase Agreement warranty clause states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b553-7\">We are selling this Vehicle to you AS-IS and we expressly disclaim all warranties, express or implied, including any implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose, unless the box beside \u201cUsed Vehicle Limited Warranty Applies\u201d is marked below or we enter into a service contract with you at the time of, or within 90 days of, the date of this transaction.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b553-8\">\u00b67 The Extended Service Contract was offered through Wynn\u2019s Extended Care, Inc., of Brea, California (Wynn\u2019s). The Contract was discussed and sold by the same Berry\u2019s salesman who negotiated the sale of the vehicle to Payne. The price of the service contract was included in the amount Payne financed, but was paid to Wynn\u2019s. The Extended Service Contract contains a clause stating, \u201c[t]his Contract is not valid unless signed by both You and an authorized representative of the Selling Dealer.\u201d The Extended Service Contract lists Berry\u2019s as the selling dealer and was signed by both Payne and the Berry\u2019s salesman.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-9\">\u00b68 On September 25, 2007, Payne returned the Explorer to Berry\u2019s for minor repairs, which Berry\u2019s completed. Payne picked up the Explorer the next day and, while driving on Interstate 94 to Glendive, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>the engine began making an abnormal sound and then stopped entirely. Payne contacted Berry\u2019s and, after initially supplying Payne with a loaner vehicle, Berry\u2019s told Payne it would not be responsible for repairs and that she should contact Wynn\u2019s. On October 19, 2007, Wynn\u2019s initially declined to cover the cost of the engine repair.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"Aq19\">\u00b69 Payne filed a complaint in Justice Court in Yellowstone County in September 2009 seeking damages for Berry\u2019s failure to honor implied warranties of the vehicle and for committing an unfair trade practice. A bench trial was held on October 12, 2011. The Justice Court issued Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and a Judgment. It concluded that \u201c[Berry\u2019s] did not provide Payne a written warranty. The used vehicle was purchase[d] without a written warranty. The vehicle was purchased \u2018as-is\u2019 without a warranty. The \u2018Buyer\u2019s Guide\u2019 affixed to the vehicle and signed by Payne made it clear to Payne assumed (sic) the risk and responsibility for repairs.\u201d The Justice Court further concluded that \u201cPayne had the option to obtain a service contract from Wynn to cover repairs and breakdowns. Implied warranties do not apply unless the service contract is made with the seller of the vehicle. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 2308(a)(2)[.] Payne purchased the service contract from Wynn not Berry. If the breakdown is one covered under the service agreement, Payne should seek redress with Wynn, not Berry.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b554-4\">\u00b610 Payne appealed the Justice Court Judgment to the Thirteenth Judicial District Court. The District Court, upon a review of the Justice Court record and the parties\u2019 briefing, affirmed the Justice Court, reasoning:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-5\">The extended service contract is clearly between [Payne] and Wynn\u2019s. Berry\u2019s did not \u201cmake any written warranty to the consumer,\u201d nor did Berry\u2019s \u201center into a service contract with the consumer.\u201d Wynn\u2019s was the supplier referenced in 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 2308(a). Just because Berry\u2019s offered the contract and sold the contract to [Payne], does not mean Berry\u2019s was responsible for that contract.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b554-6\">Payne appeals.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b555-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b555-4\">\u00b611 \u201c Tn an appeal from a justice court established as a court of record, the district court functions as an appellate court and the appeal is confined to a review of the record and questions of law....

Did Berry\u2019s effectively disclaim implied warranties of a used vehicle under \u00a7 30-2-316, MCA, when the transaction included purchase of a service contract for the vehicle ?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b555-8\">\u00b614 Payne challenged Berry\u2019s asserted disclaimer of implied warranties of the vehicle under federal and state law. She argues that the federal Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act (Act), codified at 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2301-2312, \u201cbars a seller from disclaiming implied warranties when it also enters into a service contract with a consumer purchaser\u201d and \u201c[s]ince Berry\u2019s sold the service contract to Payne, it cannot disclaim implied warranties.\u201d Payne challenges the District Court\u2019s conclusion that \u201cPasme purchased the service contract from Wynn, not Berry.\u201d Berry\u2019s argued before the Justice Court and the District Court that it sold the service contract only on behalf of Wynn\u2019s and did not itself \u201center into\u201d a service contract with Payne.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-9\">\u00b615 The Act was implemented to prevent deceptive warranty practices and to improve the adequacy of information available to consumers. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 2302(a) (2006). Under the Act, a dealer\u2019s ability to disclaim implied warranties is limited when the dealer \u201centers into\u201d a service <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>contract covering the consumer product with the consumer.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-4\">(a) Restrictions on disclaimers or modifications. No supplier may disclaim or modify (except as provided in subsection (b) of this section) any implied warranty to a consumer with respect to such consumer product if (1) such supplier makes any written warranty to the consumer with respect to such consumer product, or (2) at the time of sale, or within 90 days thereafter, such supplier enters into a service contract with the consumer which applies to such consumer product.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b556-5\">15 U.S.C. \u00a7 2308(a). The Act defines a service contract with a consumer as <em>\u201ca </em>contract in writing to perform, over a fixed period of time or for a specified duration, services relating to the maintenance or repair (or both) of a consumer product.\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 2301(8).</p>\n<p id=\"b556-6\">\u00b616 The primary legal conclusion upon which the Justice Court and District Court rested their holdings was that the Act did not prohibit Berry\u2019s from disclaiming warranties in this transaction because Berry\u2019s did not itself \u201center into a service contract\u201d with Payne, Wynn\u2019s had done so. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 2308(a). Having so concluded, the District Court did not address Payne\u2019s alternate argument-that Berry\u2019s did not effectively disclaim implied warranties under state law. The Justice Court went further than the District Court by also essentially concluding that Berry\u2019s had effectively disclaimed any warranties, but did not specifically discuss state law. Because we believe the issue is resolved under state statutes, we do not address the application of the federal Act. Even if Berry\u2019s was not precluded from disclaiming implied warranties by the Act, there remains the question of whether Berry\u2019s attempted disclaimer was effective under governing state provisions. As Payne argues, \u201cit is necessary to look to federal law\u201d only if \u201cMontana law does not settle the issue.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b557-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>\u00b617 Payne argues that Berry\u2019s did not effectively disclaim implied warranties because the language of the sale documents by which Berry\u2019s is purporting to disclaim also states that the disclaimer may not apply if a service agreement is purchased, and, thus, does not \u201cmake plain\u201d that there is no implied warranty. Payne asserts that \u201c[i]t is certainly not \u2018plain\u2019 that there are no warranties when the disclaimer language indicates it may not apply when the service contract is purchased\u201d and \u201c[t]he common understanding of the qualifying language used by Berry\u2019s is that there is an implied warranty if one purchases a service agreement.\u201d Berry\u2019s argued in the Justice Court and the District Court that it effectively disclaimed any implied warranty by satisfying the requirements for disclaimer under the Montana Uniform Commercial Code (U.C.C.).</p>\n<p id=\"b557-4\">\u00b618 Montana has adopted the U.C.C. to govern sales. <em>See generally </em>Title 30, Chapter 2, MCA. The U.C.C. specifically identifies implied warranties for merchantability, \u00a7 30-2-314, MCA, and fitness for a particular purpose, \u00a7 30-2-315, MCA, for goods sold. These implied warranties apply to sales of consumer goods \u201cunless excluded or modified\u201d pursuant to \u00a7 30-2-316, MCA. <em>See </em>\u00a7\u00a7 30-2-314(1), 30-2-315, MCA. Section 30-2-316, MCA, discusses exclusion of warranties, in pertinent part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-5\">(2) Subject to subsection (3), to exclude or modify the implied warranty of merchantability or any part of it the language must mention merchantability and in case of a writing must be conspicuous, and to exclude or modify any implied warranty of fitness the exclusion must be by a writing and conspicuous. Language to exclude all implied warranties of fitness is sufficient if it states, for example, that \u201cThere are no warranties which extend beyond the description on the face hereof.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-6\">(3) Notwithstanding subsection (2):</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-7\">(a) unless the circumstances indicate otherwise, all implied warranties are excluded by expressions like \u201cas is\u201d, \u201cwith all faults\u201d or other language which in common understanding calls the buyer\u2019s attention to the exclusion of warranties and makes plain that there is no implied warranty[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b557-8\">Sections 30-2-316(2), (3)(a), MCA. Thus, a writing purporting to disclaim implied warranties of merchantability or fitness must be \u201cconspicuous\u201d and state, as an example, \u201c[tjhere are no warranties...\u201d Section 30-2-316(2), MCA. Further, notwithstanding these general rules for disclaimer, an implied warranty may also be disclaimed by use of colloquial language of common understanding, such as a product <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>is being sold \u201cas is,\u201d which \u201cmakes plain\u201d that there is no implied warranty, unless the circumstances would indicate otherwise. Section 30-2-316(3)(a), MCA; <em>see </em>U.C.C. \u00a7 2-316, cmt. 6 (2011) (The exceptions to the general rules in subsection 316(2), as set forth in paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) of subsection 316(3), \u201care common factual situations in which the circumstances surrounding the transaction are in themselves sufficient to call the buyer\u2019s attention to the fact that no implied warranties are made ...\u201d); <em>see also </em>James J. White, Robert S. Summers &amp; Robert A. Hillman, <em>Uniform Commercial Code </em>\u00a7\u00a7 13:11-12, 1104-06 (6th ed., West 2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b558-4\">\u00b619  Here, although three sales documents contain language that is \u201cconspicuous,\u201d provide a message equivalent to the statutory example that \u201cthere are no warranties,\u201d and use colloquial \u201cas is\u201d terms, those documents also clearly provide a directly contradictory message. Section 30-2-316(2), (3)(a), MCA. The Retail Installment Contract reads: \u2018You understand that the seller is not offering any warranties ... unless the seller extends a written warranty or service contract within 90 days from the date of this contract.\u201d The Retail Purchase Agreement states: \u201cWe are selling this Vehicle to you AS-IS and we expressly disclaim all warranties ... unless ... we enter into a service contract with you at the time of, or within 90 days of, the date of this transaction.\u201d Berry\u2019s argument was that these provisions did not trigger an implied warranty because Berry\u2019s itself did not \u201cextend\u201d or \u201center into\u201d the service contract-Wynn\u2019s had done so. However doubtful that argument may be on its face, the language of the Buyer\u2019s Guide was broader and removed any doubt: \u201cIf you buy a service contract within 90 days of the time of sale, state law \u2018implied warranties\u2019 may give you additional rights.\u201d This provision did not condition implied warranties upon Payne\u2019s purchase of a service contract directly from Berry\u2019s; it only required that a service contract be purchased. Berry\u2019s had employed the colloquial language disclaimer that the Explorer was being sold \u201cas is,\u201d but the circumstances here clearly \u201cindicated] otherwise,\u201d and the contractual provisions that specifically advised Payne that implied warranty rights may be available if she purchased a service contract negated the colloquial language that \u201c[made] plain\u201d that warranties were disclaimed. Section 30-2-316(3)(a), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-5\">\u00b620  Consequently, the sales documents used here by Berry\u2019s failed to disclaim statutory implied warranties under the requirements of \u00a7\u00a7 30-2-316(2), (3)(a), MCA. The District Court thus erred in affirming the Justice Court\u2019s holding that Berry\u2019s effectively disclaimed implied <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>warranties for the vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-4\">\u00b621 <em>2. Did the District Court err by affirming the Justice Court\u2019s denial of Payne\u2019s implied warranty claim?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b559-5\">\u00b622  Establishing the existence of an implied warranty for the vehicle is the first step in pursuit of a breach of warranty claim. The sale documents clearly state that implied warranties under state law <em>may </em>apply, and the fact that Berry\u2019s failed to effectively disclaim those warranties eliminates only Berry\u2019s disclaimer defense to the claim. As the official comments to the U.C.C. explain: \u201cIn an action based on breach of warranty, it is of course necessary to show not only the existence of the warranty but the fact that the warranty was broken and that the breach of the warranty was the proximate cause of the loss sustained.\u201d U.C.C. \u00a7 2-314, cmt. 13; <em>see e.g. Kraft Reinsurance Ir., Ltd. v. Pallets Acquisitions, LLC, </em>845 F. Supp. 2d 1342, 1356-57 (N.D. Ga. <em>2011); Nev. Contract Servs. Inc. v. Squirrel Cos., Inc., </em>68 P.3d 896, 899 (Nev. 2003). A noted authority on the U.C.C. offers the following summary of the necessary proof:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b559-6\">First, the claimant must prove that the defendant made a warranty, express or implied, and so incurred an obligation under 2-313, 2-314, or 2-315. Second, the claimant must prove that the goods did not comply with the warranty. Third, the claimant must prove that the injury was caused, proximately and in fact, by the defective nature of the goods.... Finally, the claimant must fight off all sorts of affirmative defenses, such as disclaimers, statute of limitations, privity, lack of notice, and assumption of the risk.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AC2\">James J. White, Robert S. Summers &amp; Robert A. Hillman, <em>Uniform Commercial Code </em>\u00a7 10:1, 846 (6th ed., West 2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b559-7\">\u00b623 In addition to concluding that Berry\u2019s had provided no warranty for the vehicle, the Justice Court entered findings from the evidence regarding the other elements of Payne\u2019s breach of warranty claim:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AT0\">Payne provided no creditable evidence as to the actual cause of the vehicle\u2019s engine problem or the repairs needed. Payne presented no expert testimony as to the cause of the breakdown or the actual cost to repair the vehicle. The vehicle was in the possession of Payne when it broke down. The vehicle had been driven about 2,000 miles by Payne. The breakdown could have been caused by unreasonable use by Payne or her failure to maintain the vehicle. Payne presented no creditable evidence that the breakdown was the result of a patent defect or malfunction.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AbQ\">\u00b624 After reviewing the testimony introduced at trial, we must conclude that these findings of fact by the Justice Court are not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>erroneous. Payne testified only that the engine had stopped and a mechanic had removed it. She offered no evidence whatsoever about the engine\u2019s particular mechanical problem or what had caused the problem. There was no effort to demonstrate that the engine had stopped operating because it was not in the condition impliedly guaranteed by Berry\u2019s, as opposed to any other cause for its failure to operate, such as lack of necessary maintenance.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-4\">\u00b625  Payne\u2019s breach of warranty claim failed for lack of evidence necessary to satisfy the elements of breach and causation. The parties also contested damages at trial, but the failure to establish liability makes it unnecessary to address that issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-5\">\u00b626 In affirming the Justice Court\u2019s judgment in favor of Berry\u2019s, the District Court reached the correct result. We will not reverse the district court when it reaches the right result, \u201ceven if it reached that result for the wrong reason.\u201d <em>Yellowstone River LLC, </em>\u00b6 58.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-6\">\u00b627 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b560-7\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES WHEAT, COTTER and BAKER concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b554-7\"> Payne testified at trial that negotiations with Wynn\u2019s about the matter were ongoing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b554-8\"> Berry\u2019s did not file an appellee\u2019s brief in answer to Payne\u2019s briefing or otherwise participate in this appeal.
