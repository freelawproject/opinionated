Nixon appeals his conviction on the ground that the Montana Eleventh Judicial District Court, Flathead County, erred in denying his motion to suppress statements he made during a custodial interrogation. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-6\">PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b382-7\">\u00b62 On April 17,2010, Sergeant Jim Wardensky of the Kalispell Police Department responded to a report from Wesley Collins\u2019s landlord that his apartment had been burglarized. Police had been to the apartment the day before for a requested welfare check on Collins and had not found him. While Wardensky was investigating the break-in, bystanders told additional responding officers that two individuals were running out the back window of Collins\u2019s apartment. One officer chased the individuals and apprehended Robert Lake, who was taken into custody for questioning. Although Lake initially blamed Nixon for Collins\u2019s disappearance, within hours, Lake \u201chad admitted to killing Mr. Collins and putting his body up in the Patrick Creek area.\u201d Lake made statements further implicating Nixon in the homicide and proceeded to show Wardensky where Collins\u2019s body was located.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-8\">\u00b63 In the early hours of April 18, Nixon\u2019s father was driving Nixon home from his older brother\u2019s bachelor party. During the party, which lasted approximately seven hours, Nixon estimated he consumed about ten drinks. On their way home, Nixon and his father were stopped by four law enforcement officers who, with weapons drawn, detained the two and then transported Nixon to the Kalispell Police Station for questioning.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> An arresting officer informed Nixon during transport that he had been arrested on two outstanding misdemeanor warrants; he was not informed that he was the subject of a homicide investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-9\">\u00b64 Nixon arrived at the police station at 4:30 a.m. and was given a copy of his outstanding warrants. All movements and statements he made at the station were videotaped by Kalispell police. At first, Nixon was left alone in the booking area of the station for approximately two <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>hours, during which time he slept on a bench. Just prior to 7:00 a.m., Sergeant Wardensky woke Nixon up and began to interview him. Wardensky asked Nixon if he had been drinking; Nixon admitted that he had had \u201cquite a bit\u201d to drink. Wanting to ensure that Nixon was not incapacitated, Wardensky asked Nixon to provide a breath sample on a portable breath testing device. The test showed Nixon\u2019s blood alcohol content to be .08. Wardensky then told Nixon that what he would like to do is \u201cvisit with you a little bit about something that I\u2019ve been looking at and working on, starting yesterday morning I guess.\u201d First, however, Wardensky asked Nixon a series of general questions about where he lived, the bachelor party he had attended, and his brother\u2019s impending wedding.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-4\">\u00b65 Wardensky then read Nixon his rights pursuant to <em>Miranda v. Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 86 S. Ct. 1602 (1966), as provided on the Kalispell Police Department\u2019s \u201cYOUR RIGHTS\u201d form. The following dialogue occurred immediately after Wardensky read Nixon his rights:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"APf\">NIXON: Just a slight question.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-5\">WARDENSKY: Sure.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-6\">NIXON: Why did you ask me questions before you read me my rights?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-7\">WARDENSKY: Urn...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-8\">NIXON: I was just curious...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-9\">WARDENSKY: Curious, and, and ah, I would be happy to answer that. Because, uh, I wanted to see what your cognitive process is, ya know, and ah, given the fact that you\u2019ve had a little bit to drink tonight, I wanted to see if, you know, if you could answer a few questions, and ah, you know, and see if things are cooking up seriously upstairs for ya. They seem to be, so. Okay does that answer that for ya?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-10\">NIXON: Yeah.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-11\">WARDENSKY: Okay, do you want to talk to me?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-12\">NIXON: There isn\u2019t really anything to talk about.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AWx\">WARDENSKY: Well, I\u2019ve got a bunch.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-13\">NIXON: I\u2019m tired. I\u2019ve been up since six yesterday morning and I\u2019ve been sitting here for a while.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-14\">WARDENSKY: Well that\u2019s pretty ironic, so have I.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-15\">NIXON: Yeah, if I was you I would be home sleeping...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Am1\">WARDENSKY: Well, hopefully that\u2019ll be the case here shortly.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ag4\">NIXON: I sure hope so, I\u2019ve got a wedding here in a couple of hours.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-16\">WARDENSKY: Yeah. So, you interested in talking with me Jeff?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b384-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>NIXON: I really don\u2019t have anything to talk about. I was told I was brought in here on traffic tickets, but one of \u2019ems a traffic ticket, the other one\u2019s a theft. I don\u2019t really have anything to talk about.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b384-4\">WARDENSKY: Okay. Well, there\u2019s a little more to it than that and that\u2019s what I would like to talk to you about.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b384-5\">NIXON: Talk away, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b384-6\">WARDENSKY: Okay. Um, one of the things that I would like to do Jeff, is ah, get a signature from you and all that, that says I read this to you and you understand, okay? You wanna hop up here and sign that for me?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b384-7\">NIXON: Do I get to read it first.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b384-8\">WARDENSKY: Absolutely, here you go.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b384-9\">NIXON: (Reads and signs paper.)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b384-10\">\u00b66 After Nixon read and signed the statement identifying his <em>Miranda </em>rights, signaling that he understood those rights and was willing to talk to law enforcement, Wardensky began to ask him general questions about Robert Lake and Wesley Collins. Although initially Nixon stated that he had had limited contact with Collins, eventually he explained that he had smoked marijuana with Collins on several occasions. Wardensky then informed Nixon that the Kalispell Police Department had received a missing person\u2019s report regarding Collins. Nixon did not invoke his right to remain silent at that point, and instead answered Wardensky\u2019s questions about when he last had seen Collins. Wardensky then \u201ccut to the chase,\u201d told Nixon he knew \u201cWes is dead\u201d and informed Nixon that he was conducting a homicide investigation. Nixon did not invoke his right to remain silent at that point, but continued to answer Wardensky\u2019s questions about the events surrounding Collins\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-11\">\u00b67 On April 22, 2010, the Flathead County Attorney filed an information charging Nixon with causing the death of Wesley Collins. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>The county attorney later filed an amended information charging Nixon with the following felony offenses: (1) Accountability for Deliberate Homicide in violation of \u00a7\u00a7 45-2-302(3) and 45-5-102(l)(a), MCA, and, in the alternative, Deliberate Homicide, in violation of \u00a7 45-5-102(l)(b), MCA; (2) Robbery, in violation of \u00a7 45-5-401(l)(a), MCA; (3) Tampering with Physical Evidence, in violation of \u00a7 45-7-207(l)(a), MCA; and (4) Burglary, in violation of \u00a7 45-6-204(l)(b), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-4\">\u00b68 Nixon filed a motion to suppress statements he made during his interview with Sergeant Wardensky. The District Court held a hearing on the matter on September 17, 2010. Both Nixon and Wardensky testified. The court viewed portions of the videotaped interview and admitted several pages of a transcript of the interview into evidence. Nixon also testified; he stated that he understood his <em>Miranda </em>rights during the interview and acknowledged that he never specifically told Wardensky that he did not want to talk to him, although he did say that he did not really have anything to talk about. After the hearing, the District Court denied Nixon\u2019s motion to suppress. The court found that Nixon voluntarily agreed to answer Wardensky\u2019s questions and further concluded that Nixon \u201cdid not unambiguously invoke his right to remain silent and in fact, when he directs the officer to \u2018talk away\u2019 he appears to be agreeing to answer questions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">\u00b69 Nixon\u2019s trial began on July 11, 2011. Several of Nixon\u2019s acquaintances testified against him, including some who had been charged in connection with Collins\u2019s death. Nixon also testified on his own behalf. The trial testimony established that Collins lived upstairs from Lake and his girlfriend and that Nixon, Lake and Collins had smoked marijuana together on occasion. Testimony showed that, on April 12, 2010, Collins invited Nixon and Lake into his apartment to smoke marijuana. While they were smoking, Lake knocked Collins unconscious by striking him in the head with a claw hammer. Lake then told Nixon to shut the blinds in the apartment and check whether Collins\u2019s marijuana plants were budding; Nixon followed Lake\u2019s directions. When Collins began to regain consciousness, Lake responded by striking him with another hammer and eventually proceeding to strangle him with string.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-6\">\u00b610 After Collins was dead, Nixon left the apartment to purchase cigarettes at a nearby gas station. He acknowledged at trial that he could have called the police at this point, but he chose not to. Instead, he returned to the apartment complex and played an integral role in disposing of Collins\u2019s body.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-7\">\u00b611 Nixon told Lake that they should dump Collins\u2019s body at Patrick <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>Creek, a remote area in the mountains. Nixon borrowed a truck from a friend to transport the body. Then he, Lake, and Lake\u2019s friend wrapped Collins\u2019s body in blankets and threw it out the window. Nixon drove the truck to the back of the apartment and the trio loaded Collins\u2019s body into the truck bed. Nixon drove to Patrick Creek, where they dumped the body. The next morning, Nixon attempted to drive back to Patrick Creek to pour lye on Collins\u2019s body, but he was unable to reach the body because it had snowed that night.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-4\">\u00b612 The State did not introduce the video of Wardensky\u2019s interview with Nixon as evidence or play it for the jury. The State points out that the only time it referenced the interview in its case-in-chief was during its direct examination of Wardensky:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-5\">Q. Jim, let\u2019s talk about the interview of the Defendant. When you were interviewing Mr. Nixon did he admit to being a lookout?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-6\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-7\">Q. Did he admit to taking anything?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-8\">A. Yes, he did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-9\">Q. What did he admit to taking?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-10\">A. Marijuana.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b386-11\">In addition, the State used statements from the interrogation in cross-examining Nixon.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-12\">\u00b613 After deliberating for over four hours, the jury found Nixon guilty of robbery, accountability for deliberate homicide, tampering with physical evidence, and burglary. The District Court subsequently committed Nixon to the Montana State Prison for a net sentence of 100 years.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-13\">\u00b614 Nixon argues that his conviction should be reversed and a new trial granted because of the District Court\u2019s refusal to suppress statements he made during his custodial interrogation.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-14\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b386-15\">\u00b615 When reviewing a district court\u2019s ruling on a motion to suppress, we \u201cdetermine whether the findings of fact are clearly erroneous and whether the court correctly interpreted the law and applied it to those facts.\u201d <em>State v. Haldane, </em>2013 MT 32, \u00b6 15, 368 Mont. 396, 300 P.3d 657 (citing <em>State v. Anders, </em>2012 MT 62, \u00b6 9, 364 Mont. 316, 274 P.3d 720). A factual finding is clearly erroneous if it is \u201cnot supported by substantial evidence, if the court has misapprehended the effect of the evidence, or if this Court\u2019s review of the record leaves us with a definite or firm conviction that a mistake has been made.\u201d <em>State v. Morrisey, </em>2009 MT 201, \u00b6 14, 351 Mont. 144, 214 P.3d 708.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b387-4\">\u00b616 <em>Whether the District Court erred in denying Nixon\u2019s motion to suppress statements he made during his custodial interrogation with Sergeant Wardensky.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">\u00b617 No person \u201cshall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself.\u201d U.S. Const, amend. V. The Fifth Amendment\u2019s Self-Incrimination Clause applies to the States through the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s Due Process Clause. <em>Malloy v. Hogan, </em>378 U.S. 1, 6-11, 84 S. Ct. 1489, 1492-95 (1964). The Montana Constitution similarly provides that \u201c[n]o person shall be compelled to testify against himself in a criminal proceeding.\u201d Mont. Const, art. II, \u00a7 25.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-6\">\u00b618 This privilege against self-incrimination is \u201cavailable outside of criminal court proceedings and serves to protect persons \u2018in all settings in which their freedom of action is curtailed in any significant way from being compelled to incriminate themselves.\u2019 \u201d <em>Morrisey, </em>\u00b6 27 (quoting <em>Miranda, </em>384 U.S. at 467, 86 S. Ct. at 1624). Because the modern practice of custodial interrogation \u201ccontains inherently compelling pressures which work to undermine the individual\u2019s will to resist and to compel him to speak where he would not otherwise do so freely,\u201d the Supreme Court has established \u201cconcrete constitutional guidelines\u201d for law enforcement agencies to follow. <em>Miranda, </em>384 U.S. at 467, 442, 86 S. Ct. at 1624, 1611. When a person \u201cis taken into custody or otherwise deprived of his freedom by the authorities in any significant way and is subjected to questioning,\u201d he \u201c \u2018must be adequately and effectively apprised of his rights and the exercise of those rights must be fully honored.\u2019 \u201d <em>Morrisey, </em>\u00b6 28 (quoting <em>Miranda, </em>384 U.S. at 478, 467, 86 S. Ct. at 1630, 1624).</p>\n<p id=\"b387-7\">\u00b619 These rights, commonly known as <em>Miranda </em>rights, mandate that before a person may be subjected to a custodial interrogation, \u201che \u2018must be warned prior to any questioning that he has the right to remain silent, that anything he says can be used against him in a court of law, that he has the right to the presence of an attorney, and that if he cannot afford an attorney one will be appointed for him prior to any questioning if he so desires.\u2019 \u201d <em>Morrisey, </em>\u00b6 28 (quoting <em>Miranda, </em>384 U.S. at 479, 86 S. Ct. at 1630). Failure by law enforcement officers to give these warnings and obtain a waiver of rights prior to a custodial interrogation \u201cgenerally requires exclusion of any statements obtained.\u201d <em>Morrisey, </em>\u00b6 28.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-8\">\u00b620 There is no dispute in this case that Nixon was subjected to a custodial interrogation when he was interviewed by Sergeant Wardensky at the police station. <em>See State v. Munson, </em>2007 MT 222, \u00b6 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>21, 339 Mont. 68, 169 P.3d 364. Nixon does not assert that Sergeant Wardensky failed to read the aforementioned <em>Miranda </em>rights prior to questioning him. The video recording of Nixon\u2019s interview reveals that Wardensky read the <em>Miranda </em>warnings to Nixon and provided him with a written copy of his rights, which Nixon read and signed. At the suppression hearing, Nixon testified that he understood each of those rights. Nixon contends, instead, that he invoked his right to remain silent or, in the alternative, that he did not voluntarily waive his rights. For those reasons, Nixon alleges, the District Court erred when it failed to suppress the statements he made to Wardensky.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-4\">\n<em>A. Whether Nixon invoked his right to remain silent.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">\u00b621 Nixon contends that he \u201cattempted to invoke his <em>Fifth Amendment </em>right to remain silent when he said three separate times: T don\u2019t really have anything to talk about.\u2019 \u201d The State responds that Nixon did not articulate a desire to remain silent \u201csufficiently clearly that a reasonable officer in the circumstances would have understood Nixon\u2019s statements to be an invocation of his <em>Miranda </em>right to remain silent\u201d as required by the Supreme Court in <em>Berghuis v. </em>Thompkins,_U.S. _, 130 S. Ct. 2250 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b388-8\">\u00b622 In <em>Berghuis, </em>Van Chester Thompkins was arrested as a suspect in a shooting and subjected to a custodial interrogation. Berghuis,_ U.S. at_, 130 S. Ct. at 2256. At the beginning of the interrogation, officers read Thompkins his <em>Miranda </em>rights and presented him with a form explaining those rights. Thompkins refused the officers\u2019 request to sign the form to demonstrate that he understood his rights, but the officers nonetheless began to interrogate him. At no point during the interrogation, which lasted about three hours, did Thompkins say that he wished to remain silent. He was \u201c \u2018largely\u2019 silent\u201d during the interrogation, but he did provide some limited verbal and nonverbal interaction with his interrogating officers. Berghuis,_U.S. at_, 130 S. Ct. at 2256.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-14\">\u00b623 After two hours and forty-five minutes of questioning, a police officer asked Thompkins whether he believed in God and whether he prayed to God. Thompkins said \u201cyes\u201d in response to both questions. The officer then asked Thompkins whether he had asked God to forgive him for \u201cshooting that boy down\u201d; Thompkins again said \u201cyes.\u201d Berghuis,_U.S. at_, 130 S. Ct. at 2257. The district court denied Thompkins\u2019s motion to suppress statements he made during the interrogation and, after a jury trial, he was found guilty of first-degree murder. Berghuis,_U.S. at_, 130 S. Ct. at 2257-58.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-18\">\u00b624 On appeal, the Supreme Court was asked whether Thompkins <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>had invoked his right to remain silent \u201cby not saying anything for a sufficient period of time.\u201d Berghuis,_U.S. at_, 130 S. Ct. at 2259. Although it had not yet stated \u201cwhether an invocation of the right to remain silent can be ambiguous or equivocal,\u201d the Court found \u201cno principled reason to adopt different standards for determining when an accused has invoked the <em>Miranda </em>right to remain silent and the <em>Miranda </em>right to counsel at issue\u201d in <em>Davis v. United States, </em>512 U.S. 452, 114 S. Ct. 2350 (1994). Berghuis,_U.S. at_, 130 S. Ct. at 2260. The Court noted that in <em>Davis </em>it had held that if an accused \u201cmakes a statement concerning the right to counsel \u2018that is ambiguous or equivocal\u2019 or makes no statement, the police are not required to end the interrogation....\u201d Berghuis,_U.S. at_, 130 S. Ct. at 2259-60 (quoting <em>Davis, </em>512 U.S. at 461-62, 114 S. Ct. at 2355). Because Thompkins did not unambiguously and unequivocally state that he did not wish to talk to the police, the Court held that he did not invoke his right to remain silent. Berghuis,_U.S. at_, 130 S. Ct. at 2260.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-11\">\u00b625 Nixon attempts to distinguish his case from <em>Berghuis </em>on the grounds that Nixon actually invoked his right to remain silent whereas Thompkins did not, and urges the Court not to adopt <em>Berghuis </em>in any event. Nixon argues that the Montana Constitution should be construed to provide broader protection of the right against self-incrimination. He contends that his statements, \u201cI don\u2019t really have anything to talk about,\u201d invoked his right to remain silent.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-12\">\u00b626 We are not bound by decisions of the U.S. Supreme Court \u201cwhere independent state grounds exist for developing heightened and expanded rights under our state constitution.\u201d <em>Butte Community Union v. Lewis, </em>219 Mont. 426, 433, 712 P.2d 1309, 1313 (1986). When a party urges us to recognize expanded rights under the Montana Constitution, that party bears the burden of proving \u201cthat a unique aspect of the Montana Constitution, or the background material related to the provision, provides support for the greater protection that he seeks to invoke.\u201d <em>State v. Covington, </em>2012 MT 31, \u00b6 21, 364 Mont. 118, 272 P.3d 43. A party may satisfy this burden in at least one of three ways: by \u201cidentifying] unique language within the Montana Constitution\u201d dictating enhanced protection; by \u201creferencing] Constitutional Convention transcripts and committee reports\u201d showing that the delegates intended to provide greater protection; or by establishing that the right alleged \u201cmust be read in conjunction with\u201d other specified rights unique to the Montana Constitution. <em>State v. Myran, </em>2012 MT 252, \u00b6 25, 366 Mont. 532, 289 P.3d 118 (citing <em>Covington, </em>\u00b6 21).</p>\n<p id=\"b390-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>\u00b627 Nixon has not identified any language unique to the Montana Constitution or cited to any references from Montana\u2019s Constitutional Convention that suggest the right to remain silent in Article II, Section 25 provides greater protections than the same right provided by the United States Constitution. Consequently, he has the burden of demonstrating that the right to remain silent, when read in conjunction with other unique rights guaranteed by the Montana Constitution, must take on broader meaning. <em>Myran, </em>\u00b6 25. For example, when the right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures found in Article II, Section 11 of the Montana Constitution is read together with the Article II, Section 10 right of privacy, it provides greater protections than the Fourth Amendment\u2019s right against unreasonable searches and seizures. <em>State v. </em>Bullock, 272 Mont. 361, 383-85, 901 P.2d 61, 75-76 (1995). Article II, Section 10, enhances the protection because \u201cthere is no similar textual language in the United States Constitution and we have therefore recognized that this section grants rights beyond that inferred from the United States Constitution.\u201d <em>Bullock, </em>272 Mont, at 383, 901 P.2d 61, 75. Similarly, when the Article II, Section 22 prohibition against cruel and unusual punishments is read together with the Article II, Section 4 right of individual dignity, it \u201cprovide[s] Montana citizens greater protections from cruel and unusual punishment than does the federal constitution\u201d because the federal constitution \u201cdoes not expressly provide for the right to human dignity.\u201d <em>Walker v. State, </em>2003 MT 134, \u00b6 73, 316 Mont. 103, 68 P.3d 872.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-4\">\u00b628 We decline Nixon\u2019s invitation to read protections into Article II, Section 25\u2019s right to remain silent that are greater than those found in the Fifth Amendment of the United States Constitution. He contends that the Montana Constitution\u2019s right to remain silent must be read together with its right to counsel in custodial interrogations to provide additional protections to individuals invoking their right to not speak with law enforcement officers. But the right to counsel during custodial interrogation also is rooted in the Fifth Amendment. <em>State v. Scheffer, </em>2010 MT 73, \u00b6 17, 355 Mont. 523, 230 P.3d 462; <em>Miranda, </em>384 U.S. at 469-70, 86 S. Ct. at 1625-26; <em>McNeil v. Wis., </em>501 U.S. 171, 176-78, 111 S. Ct. 2204, 2208-09 (1991). We have in fact interpreted that right consistent with the principles articulated in <em>Davis. </em>That is, \u201cif a suspect makes a reference to an attorney that is ambiguous or equivocal, in that a reasonable officer in light of the circumstances would have understood only that the suspect <em>might </em>be invoking the right to counsel, the officer is not required to cease questioning.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number><em>Scheffer, </em>\u00b6 31. We also applied <em>Davis </em>to assertion of the right to counsel in <em>State v. Main, </em>2011 MT 123, \u00b6\u00b6 17-19, 360 Mont. 470, 255 P.3d 1240 (affirming the district court\u2019s determination that Main \u201cdid not clearly or unequivocally request a lawyer\u201d). The right to counsel during custodial interrogations is not unique to Montana\u2019s constitution; the right to remain silent, therefore, is not enhanced by reading the two together. <em>Myran, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 25-26.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-4\">\u00b629 Nixon\u2019s contention that we should not require that a suspect unambiguously and unequivocally invoke his or her right to remain silent finds little support in our recent opinions on the right to remain silent. In <em>State v. Morrisey, </em>decided prior to <em>Berghuis, </em>the State argued that a suspect\u2019s \u201cinvocation of his right to remain silent was invalid because it was ambiguous or equivocal.\u201d <em>Morrisey, </em>\u00b6 39. We noted that \u201cthe Supreme Court has not yet directly addressed whether <em>[Davis] </em>applies to the right to remain silent.\u201d <em>Morrisey, </em>\u00b6 39. Assuming <em>arguendo </em>that a person in custody must invoke his right to remain silent \u201c \u2018sufficiently clearly that a reasonable police officer in the circumstances would understand the statement to be\u2019 an assertion of the right,\u201d <em>Morrisey, </em>\u00b6 39 <em>(quoting Davis, </em>512 U.S. at 459, 114 S. Ct. at 2355), we noted that the critical question is whether the suspect\u2019s \u201cright to cut off questioning was \u2018scrupulously honored.\u2019 \u201d <em>Morrisey, </em>\u00b6 34 (quoting <em>Mich. v. Mosley, </em>423 U.S. 96, 104, 96 S. Ct. 321, 326 (1975)). Although Morrisey\u2019s pre-Mirancia-waiver statement that \u201cI ain\u2019t saying nothing\u201d constituted an assertion of his right to remain silent, we determined that once the formal interview began, Morrisey voluntarily changed his mind and spoke freely with the interrogating officers. <em>Morrisey, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 40, 43-44.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">\u00b630 In <em>State v. Jones, </em>we concluded that \u201cJones\u2019s statements that he was \u2018through talking\u2019 [did] not constitute an unequivocal invocation of his right to counsel <em>or to remain silent </em>on the facts of this case\u201d and, therefore, he did not invoke those rights. <em>State v. Jones, </em>2006 MT 209, \u00b6 27, 333 Mont. 294, 142 P.3d 851 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b391-6\">\u00b631 Finding no basis in Montana\u2019s Constitution or our prior case law for an expanded right against self-incrimination, we now adopt <em>Berghuis </em>and its application of the <em>Davis </em>standard to a suspect\u2019s invocation of the right to remain silent. Like the Supreme Court, we hold that \u201cthere is no principled reason to adopt different standards for determining when an accused has invoked the <em>Miranda </em>right to remain silent and the <em>Miranda </em>right to counsel at issue in <em>Davis.\u201d </em>Berghuis,_U.S. at_, 130 S. Ct. at 2260. Although there are no \u201ctalismanic phrases or any special combination of words\u201d required to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>invoke one\u2019s right to remain silent, <em>Morrisey, </em>\u00b6 40 (quoting <em>U.S. v. Ramirez, </em>79 F.3d 298, 304 (2d. Cir. 1996)), a suspect must articulate his desire to remain silent \u201csufficiently clearly that a reasonable police officer in the circumstances would understand the statement to be a request\u201d to not speak with the police. <em>Davis, </em>512 U.S. at 459, 114 S. Ct. at 2355 (citations omitted). If the suspect does not unambiguously and unequivocally invoke his right to remain silent in this manner, then the interrogating officers are not required to stop questioning the suspect pursuant to Article II, Section 25 of the Montana Constitution. <em>See Davis, </em>512 U.S. at 459, 114 S. Ct. at 2355. We apply this standard to the facts presented by Nixon.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-4\">\u00b632 Whether a suspect invokes his right to remain silent \u201cis an objective inquiry.\u201d <em>Morrisey, </em>\u00b6 40. In making this inquiry, we do not merely look to specific passages from a transcript in isolation; we \u201calso consider the circumstances in which the statement was made.\u201d <em>Scheffer, </em>\u00b6 29 (quoting <em>U.S. v. Shabaz, </em>579 F.3d 815, 819 (7th Cir. 2009)).</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">\u00b633 When Nixon was arrested, police advised him that he was being held on two outstanding misdemeanor warrants and gave him paperwork detailing those warrants. When Wardensky first asked Nixon if he wanted to talk to him, Nixon replied: \u201cThere isn\u2019t really anything to talk about.\u201d Moments later, when Wardensky again asked Nixon if he would be willing to speak with the police, Nixon replied: \u201cI really don\u2019t have anything to talk about. I was told I was brought in here on traffic tickets, but one of \u2019em\u2019s a traffic ticket, the other one\u2019s a theft. I don\u2019t really have anything to talk about.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b392-6\">\u00b634  Given this context, a reasonable police officer in the circumstances would understand Nixon\u2019s statements to mean that the outstanding warrants were self-explanatory and did not provide a sufficient topic of conversation. Once Wardensky provided Nixon with a topic of conversation-\u201cthere\u2019s a little more to it than [the misdemeanor warrants] and that\u2019s what I would like to talk to you about\u201d-Nixon affirmatively agreed to speak with the police, stating, \u201ctalk away sir,\u201d and signing the waiver of rights form. Wardensky\u2019s clarification was appropriate. We have held that to the extent they believe a suspect\u2019s statement to be ambiguous or equivocal, it is \u201c \u2018good police practice\u2019... [for police officers to ask questions] to clarify whether or not the suspect is actually invoking his <em>Miranda </em>rights.\u201d <em>Morrisey, </em>\u00b6 41 n. 8 (citing <em>Davis, </em>512 U.S. at 461, 114 S. Ct. at 2356). Asking these clarifying questions protects the constitutional rights of the suspect and minimizes \u201cthe chance of a confession being suppressed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>due to subsequent judicial second-guessing ....\u201d <em>Morrisey, </em>\u00b6 41 n. 8 (citing <em>Davis, </em>512 U.S. at 461, 114 S. Ct. at 2356). Once Wardensky advised Nixon that there was more to talk about than the traffic citations, Nixon invited additional discussion. The District Court\u2019s finding that Nixon \u201cdid not unambiguously invoke his right to remain silent\u201d is supported by substantial credible evidence. Once Nixon had signed the waiver of rights form and Sergeant Wardensky began discussing Collins\u2019s death, Nixon spoke freely. As in <em>Morrisey, </em>Nixon\u2019s right to cut off questioning was not infringed. <em>See Morrisey, </em>\u00b6 44.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-4\"><em>B. Whether Nixon voluntarily waived his </em>Miranda <em>rights.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">\u00b635 In the alternative, Nixon argues that even if he did not invoke his right to remain silent, he did not waive his <em>Miranda </em>rights in a knowing, voluntary, and intelligent manner. Any waiver he made was constitutionally-deficient, he alleges, because he was psychologically coerced, he was intoxicated, he had slept for only two hours that night, the waiver form he signed was confusing, and Sergeant Wardensky initially misled him about the scope of his custodial interrogation. The State counters by asserting that, under the totality of the circumstances, the District Court correctly concluded that Nixon made a valid waiver of his rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-6\">\u00b636 A suspect may waive his <em>Miranda </em>rights provided that the waiver \u201cis made voluntarily, knowingly, and intelligently.\u201d <em>Main, </em>\u00b6 21. This is a two-dimensional inquiry. First, the waiver \u201cmust have been voluntary in the sense that it was the product of a free and deliberate choice rather than intimidation, coercion, or deception.\u201d <em>Main, </em>\u00b6 21 (quoting <em>Moran v. Burbine, </em>475 U.S. 412, 421, 106 S. Ct. 1135, 1141 (1986)). Second, the waiver must have been made \u201cwith a full awareness of both the nature of the right being abandoned and the consequences of the decision to abandon it.\u201d <em>Main, </em>\u00b6 21 (quoting <em>Moran, </em>475 U.S. at 421, 106 S. Ct. at 1141).</p>\n<p id=\"b393-7\">\u00b637 A court\u2019s inquiry into whether a waiver was voluntary under the totality of circumstances is factual in nature. <em>State v. Hoffman, </em>2003 MT 26, \u00b6 19, 314 Mont. 155, 64 P.3d 1013. This requires consideration of \u201cthe particular facts and circumstances surrounding [the] case, including the background, experience, and conduct of the accused\u201d as well as the \u201cage, education, and intelligence of the accused, and his capacity to understand the warnings given him, the nature of his Fifth Amendment rights, and the consequences of waiving those rights.\u201d <em>Main, </em>\u00b6 21 (quoting <em>State v. Blakney, </em>197 Mont. 131, 138, 641 P.2d 1045, 1049 (1982)). Furthermore, a statement \u201cextracted by any sort of threat or violence, by the exertion of any improper influence, or by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>any direct or implied promises, however slight, has the potential for being involuntary.\u201d <em>Hoffman, </em>\u00b6 19. A court properly may conclude that a suspect has waived his or her <em>Miranda </em>rights \u201c[o]nly if the \u2018totality of the circumstances surrounding the interrogation\u2019 reveals both an uncoerced choice and the requisite level of comprehension.\u201d <em>Main, </em>\u00b6 21 (quoting <em>Moran, </em>475 U.S. at 421, 106 S. Ct. at 1141).</p>\n<p id=\"b394-4\">\u00b638 The District Court found that, \u201c[a]t the time of the interview[,] [Nixon] was 18 years of age, had completed the 12th grade and graduated from high school, had no difficulty reading, no difficulty with English, and was familiar with the Miranda advisement.\u201d After viewing a video of Nixon\u2019s interactions with Sergeant Wardensky, the District Court further found:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-5\">The Defendant\u2019s questions and responses clearly indicate that he understood the questions, the procedure, and that he had the ability to engage in meaningful conversation with the officer. He earlier in the evening had reviewed the 2 outstanding warrants and some hours later was able to indicate that both were not for traffic tickets and in fact one was for theft. This again clearly indicates that he was able [to] read, process and understand what he read, [including] the Miranda form which he signed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">After analyzing the totality of the circumstances, the District Court concluded that Nixon waived his <em>Miranda </em>rights in a knowing, intelligent, and voluntary manner. We find no error in this conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"AMC\">\u00b639 Nixon first claims that any waiver he made was involuntary because he was intoxicated and sleep-deprived at the time he was interviewed. Wardensky knew Nixon\u2019s blood alcohol content was .08, so he asked Nixon various background questions to determine whether he was lucid enough to submit to a custodial interrogation. Wardensky was satisfied with Nixon\u2019s answers, and there is no indication that Nixon did not understand the questions or otherwise was incapacitated by intoxication. Although he testified at the suppression hearing that he had difficulty focusing on the written copy of his rights, he did not tell this to Wardensky during the interrogation and it is not apparent when viewing the videotaped interrogation.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-7\">\u00b640 We have determined that a suspect\u2019s waiver of <em>Miranda </em>rights was valid even though he had consumed alcohol within six hours of his interrogation, he \u201csmelled of alcohol and occasionally slurred his words.\u201d <em>Main, </em>\u00b6 23. Our decision was guided by the fact that, like Nixon, the suspect in <em>Main </em>\u201cwasn\u2019t stumbling\u201d and he \u201canswered questions in an articulate manner.\u201d <em>Main, </em>\u00b6 23. Similarly, we have cited with approval a case from the Court of Appeals for the Eighth <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>Circuit where a suspect validly waived his <em>Miranda </em>rights even though he recently had used methamphetamine and had not slept in five days, but was able to converse coherently with law enforcement officers. <em>Hoffman, </em>\u00b6 26 (citing <em>U.S. v. Casal, </em>915 F.2d 1225, 1229 (8th Cir. 1990)). The videotaped interrogation undermines Nixon\u2019s contention that he was too intoxicated and sleep-deprived to understand what was happening; instead, he interrupted to seek clarification when he wanted it and answered Wardensky\u2019s questions in a clear, coherent manner. <em>See State v. Cassell, </em>280 Mont. 397, 403, 932 P.2d 478, 481-82 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b395-4\">\u00b641 Nixon also claims that, because he was arrested at gunpoint, he was intimidated and psychologically coerced. A suspect\u2019s statement \u201cextracted by any sort of threat or violence ... has the potential for being involuntary.\u201d <em>State v. Loh, </em>275 Mont. 460, 476, 914 P.2d 592, 602 (1996). While it is true that Nixon was arrested at gunpoint, the custodial interrogation took place nearly four hours after Nixon\u2019s arrest. Sergeant Wardensky did not threaten Nixon or psychologically coerce him at any time during his questioning. Nixon\u2019s claim on this point is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">\u00b642 Nixon next claims that his waiver of <em>Miranda </em>rights was involuntary because the \u2018YOUR RIGHTS\u201d form he signed, which presented each of his rights in writing, was confusing. When a suspect is presented with a waiver form that is \u201cerroneous, intimidating and virtually indecipherable,\u201d a suspect cannot \u201center into a knowing, intelligent or voluntary waiver\u201d of his <em>Miranda </em>rights. <em>State v. Mann, </em>2006 MT 33, \u00b6 24, 331 Mont. 137, 130 P.3d 164. In <em>Mann, </em>the waiver form the police presented to the suspect for signature contained incorrect legal statements and was worded in such a way that it was confusing and difficult to understand. <em>Mann, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 23-24.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">\u00b643 Nixon does not allege that the form he signed contained legal errors, instead, he alleges that the waiver form is \u201cindecipherable\u201d because it does not contain the word \u201cwaiver\u201d and because \u201cthe last sentence is a compound sentence.\u201d His assertion that the form was confusing is belied by his testimony at the suppression hearing, where he stated that he understood each of his <em>Miranda </em>rights after Wardensky read the waiver form to him. His argument on this point lacks factual basis and is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-7\">\u00b644 Finally, Nixon argues that Wardensky deceived him by \u201cmisleading Mr. Nixon to believe that he was brought in for misdemeanor charges alone.\u201d Without citing any authority, he contends that, \u201c[a]fter Wardensky gave [him] this false impression, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>[he] could no longer make a knowing, intelligent and voluntary decision to waive his <em>Miranda </em>rights.\u201d Nixon\u2019s claim that Wardensky said he was being questioned only because of misdemeanor charges is incorrect. Before he read Nixon the <em>Miranda </em>warnings, Wardensky told Nixon that he would like to \u201cvisit with you a little bit about something that I\u2019ve been looking at and working on, starting yesterday morning I guess.\u201d Although Wardensky did not inform Nixon that he was the subject of a homicide investigation, that does not render Nixon\u2019s waiver involuntary. The United States Supreme Court \u201chas never held that mere silence by law enforcement officials as to the subject matter of an interrogation is \u2018trickery\u2019 sufficient to invalidate a suspect\u2019s waiver of <em>Miranda </em>rights[.]\u201d <em>Colo. v. Spring, </em>479 U.S. 564, 576, 107 S. Ct. 851, 858 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b396-4\">\u00b645  The totality of the circumstances supports the District Court\u2019s finding that Nixon\u2019s waiver of his <em>Miranda </em>rights was voluntary, knowing and intelligent. Nixon was an eighteen-year-old man of normal intelligence who received a complete and timely <em>Miranda </em>warning. He signed the Kalispell Police Department form explaining those rights; his signature indicated that he understood his rights and was willing to talk to the police. Nixon later testified at the suppression hearing that he understood each of his rights after Wardensky read them to him. Nixon then waived his right to remain silent by answering War densky\u2019s questions. There is no evidence in the record of any coercive or other improper conduct by the police that would render Nixon\u2019s waiver involuntary. In fact, Nixon cannot point to any moment during the custodial interrogation when his state of intoxication, his lack of sleep, the supposed psychological coercion he experienced, or the confusing waiver form actually affected his ability to voluntarily, knowingly, and intelligently waive his <em>Miranda </em>rights. <em>See Hoffman, </em>\u00b6 28. We conclude that the District Court\u2019s finding that Nixon\u2019s <em>Miranda </em>waiver and subsequent statements to the police were voluntary was supported by substantial credible evidence and its conclusions of law were correct. <em>Main, </em>\u00b6 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">\u00b646 The District Court correctly denied Nixon\u2019s motion to suppress.
