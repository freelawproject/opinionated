Green suffered bodily injuries as a result of the accident as well as property damage to her vehicle. On January 7, 2011, Green filed a Complaint in the Fourteenth Judicial District Court against Stockton Oil and Gerber seeking damages. Stockton Oil was served but Gerber was not. Stockton did not respond to the Complaint and a default was entered against the company in February 2011. A damages hearing was subsequently conducted and a judgment for damages totaling $308,200 was entered in April 2011. In October 2011, Stockton moved to set aside the default judgment. Sixty-eight days later, the District Court granted Stockton\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-11\">\u00b62 Green appeals, contending the District Court lacked jurisdiction to set aside the default judgment once 60 days expired, citing M. R. Civ. P. 60(c)(1). She also opines that Stockton failed to satisfy the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>elements of a successful Rule 60(b) motion. Stockton urges us to uphold the District Court order setting aside the default judgment. In the event we conclude the motion was deemed denied by operation of Rule 60(c)(1) and the District Court\u2019s order must therefore be vacated, it cross-appeals, arguing that the deemed denial constituted a slight abuse of discretion. We reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-4\">ISSUES</p>\n<p id=\"b44-5\">\u00b63 Direct appeal: Did the District Court err in granting Stockton Oil\u2019s Motion to Set Aside Default Judgment 68 days after it was filed?</p>\n<p id=\"b44-6\">\u00b64 Cross-appeal: Did the District Court slightly abuse its discretion in deeming denied Stockton\u2019s motion to set aside the default judgment?</p>\n<p id=\"b44-7\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b44-8\">\u00b65 On December 2, 2008, Green\u2019s vehicle was struck by a Stockton Oil Company truck driven by Ronald Gerber. Green was injured and her car was damaged. Following the accident, Green and Stockton Oil\u2019s insurer, EMC, worked together for a period of time during which EMC paid $139,246.80 toward Green\u2019s medical bills and resolution of the claim. However, in late December 2010 discussions broke down and on January 7, 2011, Green filed a Complaint and Demand for Jury Trial (Complaint) against Stockton Oil and Gerber seeking damages. On January 10,2011, summonses were prepared for both Stockton Oil and Gerber, and on January 27, Stockton Oil was served with the Complaint and Summons.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b44-9\">\u00b66 On February 22, 2011, a default was entered against Stockton after the company failed to answer the Complaint. On March 31,2011, the District Court held a hearing to determine Green\u2019s damages. Green did not disclose to the court receipt of funds from EMC. On April 5, 2011, the District Court entered a Judgment by Default against Stockton Oil ordering the company to pay Green $308,200 in damages plus 10% interest per annum. These damages included claims for past and future medical bills, emotional distress, loss of enjoyment of life, and pain and suffering.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-10\">\u00b67 On September 26,2011, a Writ of Execution for Green\u2019s judgment was issued. It was served on Stockman Bank on October 11,2011. The record reveals that $138,273.15 was collected from both Gerber\u2019s and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>Stockton Oil\u2019s Stockman Bank accounts on behalf of Green and placed in trust with Green\u2019s attorney. However, these levied funds were subsequently returned to Gerber and Stockton.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AM\">\u00b68 On October 19, 2011, citing M. R. Civ. P. 60(b)(6), Stockton Oil filed a Motion to Set Aside Default Judgment. Stockton Oil primarily argued that Green had failed to disclose to the District Court that she had received payments totaling $139,246.80 from Stockton Oil\u2019s insurer, EMC. Stockton maintained that the Default Judgment in the amount of $308,200 should be set aside as it represented excessive damages in light of the undisclosed insurance payments.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-4\">\u00b69 On October 31, 2011, Green filed her brief in opposition to Stockton Oil\u2019s motion'. She argued that she had not yet recovered monies pursuant to the Judgment, and she acknowledged that the $308,200 judgment would be reduced by the amount of funds previously received from Stockton\u2019s insurer. She also argued that Stockton\u2019s motion should not be granted because Stockton could not satisfy the elements of a successful Rule 60(b) motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-5\">\u00b610 Pursuant to Rule 60(c), the District Court had 60 days within which to rule on Stockton\u2019s Rule 60(b) motion to set aside the default judgment. The failure to rule within those 60 days resulted in the motion being \u201cdeemed denied.\u201d Rule 60(c)(1). The deadline for the District Court\u2019s ruling was December 19, 2011. In a two-line order dated December 27, 2011, the District Court, without explanation or rationale, granted Stockton\u2019s motion to set aside the default judgment. \u00b611 On January 17, 2012, Stockton Oil filed an answer to Green\u2019s Complaint on behalf of itself and Gerber. Green appeals the District Court\u2019s order granting Stockton\u2019s motion, asserting in part that upon expiration of the 60 days allocated for a ruling under Rule 60(c), the District Court lost jurisdiction over the matter and could no longer issue any rulings in the case. In the alternative, she argues that Stockton failed to establish that it was entitled under Rule 60(b) to have the default judgment set aside. Stockton argues the court\u2019s order setting aside the default judgment was correct, and that the order should stand in light of the misconduct of Green\u2019s counsel in the manner in which she obtained the default judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b45-7\">\u00b612 Whether a district court has jurisdiction to rule on a matter is a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>question of law which we review to determine whether the district court had authority to act. A court exceeds jurisdiction through acts which exceed the defined power of a court, whether that power be defined by constitutional provisions, express statutes or rules developed by the courts. <em>In re Marriage of Richards, </em>2001 MT 183, \u00b6 5, 306 Mont. 212, 31 P.3d 1002.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-4\">\u00b613 We review the deemed denial of a motion to set aside a default judgment for a slight abuse of discretion. <em>Ford Motor Credit Co. v. Wellnitz, </em>2008 MT 314, \u00b6 11, 346 Mont. 61, 194 P.3d 630.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b46-6\">\u00b614 <em>Did the District Court err in granting Stockton Oil\u2019s Motion to Set Aside Default Judgment 68 days after it was filed?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b46-7\">\u00b615 M. R. Civ. P. 55(c) permits a court to set aside a default judgment in accordance with Rule 60(b). Rule 60(b)(l)-(5) allows a party to file a motion with the district court to relieve the party from a final judgment, order or proceeding for several specific reasons, including but not limited to, a mistake, newly discovered evidence, fraud, and a void or satisfied judgment. Rule 60(b)(l)-(5). Rule 60(b)(6) allows a party to seek relief from a final judgment for \u201cany other reason that justifies relief.\u201d A party seeking relief under Rule 60(b) must file its motion \u201cwithin a reasonable time.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Rule 60(c)(l)(2011). Rule 60(c)(1) further provides that if the court fails to rule on the 60(b) motion within 60 days after the motion is filed, \u201cthe motion must be deemed denied.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b46-8\">\u00b616 For many years, district courts and this Court have stated that once a motion has been deemed denied, the district court <em>loses jurisdiction </em>to act further. <em>See e.g. State ex rel. Sinko v. District Court, </em>64 Mont. 181, 187-88, 208 P. 952, 955 (1922); <em>Johnson v. Eagles Lodge Aerie 3913, </em>284 Mont. 474, 478, 945 P.2d 62, 64 (1997); <em>Wellnitz, </em>\u00b6 17; <em>Mobley &amp; Sons, Inc. v. Weaver, </em>2009 MT 312, \u00b6 17, 352 Mont. 396, 218 P.3d 472. For the reasons set forth below, these cases as well as those cited in footnote 4 are to a limited extent overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-9\">\u00b617 In <em>Miller v. Eighteenth Jud. Dist. Court, </em>2007 MT 149, 337 Mont. 488, 162 P.3d 121, we acknowledged our confusing and often \u201cconfounding\u201d use of the term \u201cjurisdiction.\u201d In <em>Miller, </em>we were asked to determine the consequences of a prosecutor\u2019s failure to file a notice <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>of intent to seek the death penalty within 60 days of criminal arraignment. Standard 1. la of the Montana Supreme Court Standards for Competency of Counsel for Indigent Persons in Death Penalty Cases (Standard) obligates a prosecutor to file in the district court and serve upon counsel of record within 60 days after arraignment a notice stating whether the prosecutor intends to seek the death penalty upon a conviction. The prosecutor in <em>Miller </em>let the 60 days following arraignment expire without filing the notice. <em>Miller, </em>\u00b6 6. Upon expiration of the 60-day notice of intent period, Miller and his co-defendant LeBrum filed separate motions to preclude the State from seeking the death penalty and preclude imposition of the death penalty as a sentence. <em>Miller, </em>\u00b6 7. The State subsequently filed its notice of intent arguing that the defendants were not prejudiced by its delinquent filing. <em>Miller, </em>\u00b6 8. The district court agreed and denied Miller\u2019s and LeBrum\u2019s motions. <em>Miller, </em>\u00b6 12. Miller and LeBrum sought supervisory control from this Court. <em>Miller, </em>\u00b6 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-4\">\u00b618 Miller and LeBrum argued that the 60-day deadline created <em>\u201ca </em>jurisdictional defect\u201d precluding the State from seeking the death penalty and imposing it as a sentence. <em>Miller, </em>\u00b6 42. We responded that \u201c[i]t is important not to confuse categorical time prescriptions with jurisdictional provisions.\u201d <em>Miller, </em>\u00b6 43. We explained that subject-matter jurisdiction \u201cinvolves the fundamental power and authority of a court to determine and hear an issue. Hence, a provision is properly characterized as \u2018jurisdictional\u2019 if it \u2018delineates the classes of cases ... falling within a court\u2019s adjudicatory authority.\u2019 \u201d <em>Miller, </em>\u00b6 43 (citation omitted). While disagreeing with Miller and LeBrum\u2019s jurisdictional argument, we determined that the prosecutor failed to timely file the requisite notice, and that the Standard did not contain an exception that would allow a late filing. We observed that the Standard constituted \u201ca categorical time prescription and not a jurisdictional provision,\u201d and that it is \u201c \u2018unalterable\u2019 on a defendant\u2019s motion but can be forfeited if the defendant \u2018waits too long to raise the point.\u2019 \u201d <em>Miller, </em>\u00b6 46. We therefore reversed the district court\u2019s order allowing the late notice of intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-5\">\u00b619 In <em>Davis v. State, </em>2008 MT 226, 344 Mont. 300, 187 P.3d 654, we revisited this issue as it applied to the one-year period within which a criminal defendant may challenge the validity of his or her sentence. Section 46-21-102, MCA. In <em>Davis, </em>Davis agreed to plead guilty to attempted deliberate homicide, assault on a peace officer, and criminal endangerment. He also waived his right to withdraw his guilty plea or to challenge his sentence by direct appeal, habeas corpus, or post-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>conviction relief. <em>Davis, </em>\u00b6 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-4\">\u00b620 Subsequently, Davis moved for appointment of counsel for post-conviction proceedings. The district court issued a minute entry indicating that Davis\u2019 earlier counsel remained as appointed counsel for post-conviction; however, neither Davis nor his counsel received notice of the continuation of representation. By the time it was discovered, the one-year post-conviction time bar in \u00a7 46-21-102, MCA, had run. <em>Davis, </em>\u00b6 7. Davis moved to have the one-year time bar tolled. The State did not respond to Davis\u2019 motion and the district court, sua sponte, questioned whether it had jurisdiction over this motion. It ultimately concluded that the one-year time bar was \u201cjurisdictional\u201d and could not be tolled absent new evidence of a constitutional violation. <em>Davis, </em>\u00b6 8. Davis appealed. <em>Davis, </em>\u00b6 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-5\">\u00b621 Citing extra-jurisdictional cases concluding that statutorily-prescribed time periods are \u201crigid time prescriptions for constitutionally significant purposes, but ... do not define or limit subject-matter jurisdiction,\u201d <em>(In re Civil Commitment of Giem, </em>727 N.W.2d 198, 203 (Minn. App. 2007)), we determined that the one-year time bar in \u00a7 46-21-102, MCA, was not jurisdictional. <em>Davis, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 15,25. We therefore remanded the matter to the district court with specific instructions to consider Davis\u2019 motion on equitable grounds. <em>Davis, </em>\u00b6 25.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-6\">\u00b622 More recently in <em>BNSF Ry. Co. v. Cringle, </em>2010 MT 290, 359 Mont. 20, 247 P.3d 706, we were asked to determine whether BNSF\u2019s failure to satisfy the 14-day filing deadline contained in \u00a7 49-2-505(3)(c), MCA, deprived the district court of subject-matter jurisdiction. Relying on <em>Davis </em>and <em>Miller, </em>among others, we noted in <em>Cringle </em>that \u201c[t]he [Legislature does not deprive the courts of subject matter jurisdiction when it enacts filing or notice deadlines.... We have emphasized the importance of not confusing the situation of a claimant\u2019s untimely filing with the district court\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Cringle, </em>\u00b6 13. We continued that \u201ccategorical time prescriptions\u201d do not \u201cwithdraw\u201d or \u201ccircumscribe\u201d the district courts\u2019 subject matter jurisdiction. <em>Cringle, </em>\u00b6 14. Accordingly, we remanded <em>Cringle </em>to the district court with instructions that the court hear BNSF\u2019s \u201calleged good cause that would justify its motion for an extension of time\u201d to file its appeal of the Department of Labor\u2019s ruling under \u00a7 49-2-505(3)(c) and (4), MCA. <em>Cringle, </em>\u00b6 28.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-7\">\u00b623 The foregoing cases are not completely apposite because they address situations in which a party has failed to comply with a rule-based or statutory deadline. Here, it is the court which failed to comply <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>with a rule-based deadline. Nonetheless, we conclude that the analyses in these cases of whether a court has jurisdiction to act once a deadline has expired have application in both contexts. In other words, the legal concepts to be considered vis-\u00e1-vis a court\u2019s jurisdiction to further act once a court misses a rule-based or statutory deadline are the same as those applied when a party misses such a deadline.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-4\">\u00b624  As the foregoing cases illustrate and for good reason, we have moved away from past pronouncements that statutory or rule-based time bars constitute jurisdictional impediments upon the district courts\u2019 authority to act. Quite simply, unless a statute, rule, or constitutional provision expressly imposes jurisdictional limitations, the expiration of a time bar does not deprive a district court of the jurisdiction to further act in the matter before it.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Therefore, we conclude the District Court <em>did not lose jurisdiction </em>of this matter upon expiration of the 60-day time period.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-5\">\u00b625  Having concluded the court did not lose jurisdiction of the case once the 60-day time period expired, we must next determine whether the District Court erred in entering its untimely order setting aside the default judgment. We conclude that it did. While many of the cases cited herein erroneously conclude that the district court lost jurisdiction after failing to meet a time bar, these cases also stand for the proposition that the time limits set forth in Rules 59 and 60 are mandatory and should be strictly enforced. For example, in <em>Wellnitz </em>we stated \u201cRule 60(c) incorporates the strict 60 day time limit for a district court to rule on a motion for relief from a judgment under Rule 60(b). We have consistently enforced this deadline. The time limits provided <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>in these rules are mandatory and are strictly enforced.\u201d <em>Wellnitz, </em>\u00b6 13.</p>\n<p id=\"A8O\">\u00b626 In <em>Forsythe, </em>we rejected Forsythe\u2019s argument that the temporal limitations contained in Rule 59(d) (the \u201cdeemed denied\u201d provision similar to that contained in Rule 60, are unconstitutional because they deprive her of procedural due process). <em>Forsythe, </em>\u00b6 10. We cited <em>Kelly v. Sell &amp; Sell Paint Contractors, </em>175 Mont. 440, 443, 574 P.2d 1002, 1003 (1978), for the proposition that while Rule 59(d) \u201cmay in some cases, work harsh results ... it is perhaps more important that the public have the expectation and right to finality of judgments. This can only be accomplished when there is a cut-off time for a District Court to rule.\u201d We further observed that \u201cjust because a rule is arbitrary does not mean it should not be favored.\u201d <em>Forsythe, </em>\u00b6 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-4\">\u00b627 Statutory and rule-based deadlines are important and must be strictly enforced. Thus, though the District Court had jurisdiction to act after the 60-day \u201cdeemed denied\u201d deadline had passed, it erred in categorically ignoring the expiration of the deadline and granting the motion to set aside the default judgment. Once the motion to set aside the judgment was deemed denied by operation of law, Stockton\u2019s recourse was \u201cto appeal the denial in order to preserve the issue as to whether the default judgment should be set aside.\u201d <em>Johnson, </em>284 Mont, at 479, 945 P.2d at 65.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-5\">\u00b628 The foregoing rule that rule-based and statutory deadlines must be strictly enforced carries with it a caveat. As we noted in <em>Miller, </em>\u00b6 46, a time prescription is \u201cunalterable\u201d but can be forfeited if a party \u201cwaits too long to raise the point.\u201d By way of illustration, had Green failed to promptly challenge the District Court\u2019s untimely granting of Stockton\u2019s motion to set aside the default judgment, and instead proceeded to trial on the merits of the action, a belated appeal challenging the court\u2019s earlier untimely ruling would be too late. As we noted in <em>State v. Malloy, </em>2004 MT 377, \u00b6 11, 325 Mont. 86, 103 P.3d 1064, quoting \u00a7 1-3-207, MCA, \u201cit is a well-established maxim of law that \u2018acquiescence in error takes away the right of objecting to it.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>\u2019 \u201d Because Green timely appealed the District Court\u2019s order, this caveat does not come into play here.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-6\">\u00b629 The practical effect of our ruling that the District Court erred in setting aside the default judgment is that the motion to set aside the default judgment was \u201cdeemed denied\u201d at the expiration of 60 days. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>This being so, we now address Stockton\u2019s cross-appeal issue and Green\u2019s argument that Stockton failed to satisfy the elements of a successful Rule 60(b) motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-4\">\u00b630 <em>Did the District Court slightly abuse its discretion in deeming denied Stockton\u2019s motion to set aside the default judgment?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b51-5\">\u00b631 Stockton argued to the District Court that it was seeking relief from the default judgment under Rule 60(b)(6). Relying on <em>Maulding v. Hardman, </em>257 Mont. 18, 847 P.2d 292 (1993), the company asserted that to be successful under <em>Maulding, </em>it was required to show (1) good cause and (2) a meritorious defense to the underlying claim. Stockton proclaimed that its \u201cgood cause\u201d was Green\u2019s failure to share adverse information with the District Court which, in turn, led the court to award excessive damages. Similarly, Stockton\u2019s claimed meritorious defense was that the \u201cjudgment clearly [had] excessive damages.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b51-6\">\u00b632 Green countered that <em>Maulding </em>was inapposite and, therefore, the two-prong standard in <em>Maulding </em>was not applicable to this case. She asserted that the proper standard for setting aside a default judgment under Rule 60(b)(6) was set forth in <em>Essex Ins. Co. v. Moose\u2019s Saloon, Inc., </em>2007 MT 202, \u00b6 25, 338 Mont. 423, 166 P.3d 451. Green argued that for Stockton\u2019s Rule 60(b)(6) motion to prevail, Stockton must establish: (1) extraordinary circumstances; (2) that it moved to set aside the judgment within a reasonable period of time, and (3) that it was blameless. Green maintained that Stockton did not establish that it was blameless for the entry of a default judgment against it. She also argued that under <em>Essex, </em>Stockton had to show that none of the specific reasons set forth in Rule 60(b)(l)-(5) applied to this case, and that the company failed to address this requirement. Therefore, Green argued, Stockton\u2019s failure to establish blamelessness; extraordinary circumstances; and that it did not qualify for relief under Rule 60(b)(1)-(5) precluded the District Court from granting the motion to set aside the default judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-7\">\u00b633 On appeal, Green claims Stockton did not meet its burden of establishing <em>any </em>of the three <em>Essex </em>requirements needed to prevail under Rule 60(b)(6). She argues that Stockton did not establish extraordinary circumstances that prevented the company from properly filing an answer to the Complaint or that the company was blameless for failing to answer. She contends that Mykel Stockton\u2019s affidavit to the effect he could not recall being served was insufficient to establish that he had not been served, in light of the process server\u2019s affirmative affidavit to the contrary. She further states that Stockton\u2019s motion to set aside the default judgment, filed six months after entry <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>of the judgment, was not filed within a reasonable time.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-4\">\u00b634 As in the District Court, Stockton maintains on appeal that <em>Maulding </em>provides the appropriate legal standard here because cases involving \u201can analysis of the counsel\u2019s misconduct in obtaining the default judgment and not that of the party moving to set aside the default judgment\u201d are \u201cdifferent from the run-of-the-mill Rule 60(b)(6) case.\u201d As such, Stockton urges us to not rely on \u201cthe more recent Rule 60(b)(6) cases,\u201d such as <em>Essex, </em>but return to our <em>Maulding </em>analysis. Stockton opines that a review of \u201cthe entire Rule 60(b)(6) case law\u201d reveals there are two categories of cases: (1) cases involving extraordinary situations that go beyond those covered in the first five subsections of Rule 60(b); and (2) cases in which the party in whose favor judgment was entered has acted improperly. The company asserts the <em>Essex </em>standard applies to cases in category 1 and the <em>Maulding </em>standard applies to cases in category 2. Additionally, Stockton maintains that \u201cthis case and <em>Maulding </em>fit hand in glove,\u201d and therefore we should affirm the District Court\u2019s ruling setting aside the default judgment. For the reasons set forth below, we disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"A5J\">\u00b635 Because Stockton brought its motion to set aside the default judgment under Rule 60(b)(6), and the District Court granted the motion based upon such argument, we analyze the case under that provision of Rule 60(b) and do not analyze whether the motion should have been brought under Rule 60(b)(1) \u2014 (5). However, we take this opportunity to reiterate the general rule that where the circumstances underlying a default judgment raise grounds that are covered by Rule 60(b)(l)-(5), Rule 60(b)6 is not available for application. <em>Mont. Prof'l Sports, LLC v. Nat\u2019l Indoor Football League, LLC, </em>2008 MT 98, \u00b6 54, 342 Mont. 292, 180 P.3d 1142. <em>See also Bartell v. Zabawa, </em>2009 MT 204, 351 Mont. 211, 214 P.3d 735 (Cotter, J., dissenting). We now turn to the question of whether to apply the <em>Maulding </em>test or the <em>Essex </em>test.</p>\n<p id=\"AB9\">\u00b636 <em>InMaulding, </em>Maulding claimed to have been injured when he was a passenger in a car driven by Hardman and the car slid off the road and into a ditch. With Maulding then taking the wheel, Hardman and the two other passengers pushed the car out of the ditch. No one appeared injured and everyone went home. However, Maulding later went to the hospital claiming injuries. <em>Maulding, </em>257 Mont, at 21, 847 P.2d at 294.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-5\">\u00b637 In his complaint, Maulding alleged Hardman was drinking and driving recklessly. Although served, Hardman failed to answer Maulding\u2019s complaint and the district court entered a default judgment against him. <em>Maulding, </em>257 Mont, at 21, 847 P.2d at 295. He moved to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>have it set aside and the district court scheduled a hearing on the motion. The hearing, however, was conducted after the \u201cdeemed denied\u201d deadline and Maulding argued at the hearing that the district court no longer had jurisdiction over the matter. The district court took the issue of jurisdiction under advisement but conducted the hearing. <em>Maulding, </em>257 Mont. at 22, 847 P.2d at 295. At the hearing, Hardman testified that he was not reckless and that loose gravel caused the car to slide off the road as they rounded a curve. He also stated that another passenger in the car was a corroborating witness who would testify in support of Hardman\u2019s defense. <em>Maulding, </em>257 Mont, at 23-24, 847 P.2d at 296. In other words, Hardman presented a meritorious defense to the underlying claim. Hardman also presented evidence of gross misconduct on the part of Maulding\u2019s attorney in obtaining the default judgment. Subsequently, however, the court concluded it was without jurisdiction to set aside the default judgment and Hardman appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-4\">\u00b638 On appeal, we reversed the district court and set aside the default judgment under Rule 60(b)(6). Citing <em>First Nat\u2019l Bank v. Springs, </em>225 Mont. 62, 67, 731 P.2d 332, 335 (1987),<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> we applied a two-prong test of \u201cgood cause\u201d and a \u201cmeritorious defense to the action.\u201d <em>Maulding, </em>257 Mont, at 23, 847 P.2d at 296. We acknowledged Hardman\u2019s meritorious defense and concluded that \u201cgood cause\u201d for setting aside the default judgment existed, in large part, based upon plaintiffs counsel\u2019s conduct. <em>Maulding, </em>257 Mont. at 25, 847 P.2d at 297. Among other things, plaintiffs counsel had initially worked with Hardman\u2019s insurer and then refused to return any calls from the insurer or provide documentation of the claim. Instead, plaintiff sought and obtained a default judgment against Hardman for special and punitive damages, and then delayed giving notice of the judgment to the insurer until after the 60 days within which Hardman could have filed a Rule 60(b)(l)-(3) motion had expired. We further observed that plaintiffs counsel failed to disclose certain facts to the court in the ex parte default proceedings that were material to the propriety of default judgment and the award of punitive damages. Based upon this conduct and the questionable manner in which plaintiffs damages were established in the district court, we concluded that Hardman was entitled to relief under Rule 60(b)(6). <em>Maulding, </em>257 Mont. at 25, 847 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>P.2d at 298.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-4\">\u00b639 Stockton maintains that the conduct of Green\u2019s counsel compels the same result, arguing that Green\u2019s failure to advise the District Court at the time of entry of the default judgment that Stockton\u2019s insurer had already paid her the sum of $139,246.80, justified the order setting aside the default judgment. We disagree. Although the sums previously paid by the insurer were not disclosed at the time of entry of judgment, Green has consistently conceded the propriety of a set-off for these amounts against the judgment amount. Moreover, Maulding obtained an award of compensatory damages without presenting expert testimony on plaintiffs medical condition and an award of punitive damages by arguably misrepresenting the facts underlying the accident to the district court. Here, there was no similar level of misconduct. While we do not condone her lack of candor with the District Court at the time of the default judgment hearing on damages, the actions of Green\u2019s counsel do not present the level of improper conduct that we found in <em>Maulding </em>to constitute good cause for setting aside the default judgment. <em>In re Marriage of Castor, </em>249 Mont. 495, 500, 817 P.2d 665, 668 (1991). We therefore conclude that <em>Maulding </em>is inapposite. Moreover, because this Court in <em>Maulding </em>erroneously applied the two-part test to be applied when considering a motion to set aside a default-as opposed to a default judgment- we are constrained to overturn it to a limited extent so as to eliminate competing lines of authority in our Rule 60(b)(6) case law.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-5\">\u00b640 It is important to maintain the distinction between setting aside a default and setting aside a default judgment. Rule 55(c) provides that \u201c[t]he court may set aside an entry of default for good cause, and it may set aside a default judgment under Rule 60(b).\u201d We have repeatedly held that a party seeking to set aside the entry of default must establish good cause for doing so, and the existence of a meritorious defense to the action. <em>McClurg v. Flathead County Comm\u2019rs, </em>188 Mont. 20, 610 P.2d 1153 (1980). However, we subsequently-and erroneously-relied upon a \u201cgood cause\u201d analysis when addressing the propriety of setting aside a default judgment in <em>First Nat\u2019l Bank. First Nat\u2019l Bank, </em>225 Mont. at 67, 731 P.2d at 335. In turn, we relied upon <em>First Nat\u2019l Bank </em>in <em>Maulding, </em>quoting it for the proposition that \u201ca party seeking to set aside a default judgment must show both a good cause for doing so under Rule 60(b) and the existence of a meritorious defense.\u201d <em>Maulding, </em>257 Mont, at 23, 847 P.2d at 296. Thus, <em>Maulding </em>perpetuated the erroneous importation of the \u201cgood cause\u201d standard for setting aside a default, into cases concerned with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>setting aside a default judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-4\">\u00b641  A default is accomplished at the request of the moving party by mere clerical entry at the expiration of the time allotted for a responsive pleading; a default judgment, on the other hand, is the final decision of a court of law. While the terms we use when addressing the burden on a movant seeking to set aside a default versus a default judgment are somewhat amorphous, it should be more difficult to achieve the latter than the former. We therefore deem it necessary to reassert the distinction between the burden imposed on a party seeking to set aside a default (good cause and a meritorious defense), versus that imposed in setting aside a default judgment. More particularly, we reassert that the burden on a person seeking to set aside a default judgment under Rule 60(b)(6) shall be that set forth in <em>Essex. </em>To the extent that the test applied in <em>First Nat\u2019l Bank </em>and <em>Maulding </em>imposed a lesser burden on the party moving to set aside a default judgment under Rule 60(b)(6), these cases are overturned. \u00b642 In <em>Essex, </em>we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-5\">A successful Rule 60(b)(6) motion requires that the movant demonstrate each of the following elements: (1) extraordinary circumstances; (2) the movant acted to set aside the judgment within a reasonable period of time; and (3) the movant was blameless. (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b55-6\"><em>Essex, </em>\u00b6 25 (citations omitted). This well-established three-prong test requires that all three prongs be met. In <em>Orcutt v. Orcutt, </em>2011 MT 107, 360 Mont. 353, 253 P.3d 884, a dissolution matter, we reviewed the wife\u2019s request to set aside a final judgment under Rule 60(b)(6). Applying the <em>Essex </em>test, and addressing the \u201cextraordinary circumstances\u201d prong, we stated that \u201cextraordinary circumstances\u201d include gross neglect or actual misconduct by an attorney. <em>Orcutt, </em>\u00b6 12. We further noted that \u201cRule 60(b)(6) ... is designed primarily for situations where a party is wronged through no fault of its own.\u201d <em>Orcutt, </em>\u00b6 15. We determined that wife\u2019s attorney \u201cgrossly neglected\u201d her case, resulting in a flagrantly inequitable distribution of the marital estate. <em>Orcutt, </em>\u00b6 17. This constituted extraordinary circumstances. Further, it was undisputed that the wife promptly moved to set aside the final judgment, and it was apparent that she was blameless. We therefore concluded that the district court had abused its discretion in denying her motion. <em>See also Bartell, </em>\u00b6 25; <em>Wellnitz, \u00b6 </em>18; <em>C.T.E.-H. v. T.M.E., </em>2004 MT 307, \u00b6 45, 323 Mont. 498, 101 P.3d 254; <em>Bahm v. Southworth, </em>2000 MT 244, \u00b6 14, 301 Mont. 434, 10 P.3d 99; <em>Karlen v. Evans, </em>276 Mont. 181, 190, 915 P.2d 232, 238 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>(1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b56-4\">\u00b643  In the case before us, Stockton has not met its burden of establishing extraordinary circumstances or blamelessness. Given the fact that Green has always conceded the propriety of a full offset against the judgment of the amounts she received from the insurance company, her conduct does not present the type of \u201cgross neglect or actual misconduct\u201d that existed in <em>Orcutt </em>as an extraordinary circumstance. Further, in light of proof from the process server that Stockton was served with the Complaint and Summons, the affidavit assertion of registered agent Mykel Stockton that he cannot recall seeing the Complaint does not established blamelessness. As we are here analyzing the propriety of the deemed-denial, we therefore conclude that the District Court did not slightly abuse its discretion in deeming denied Stockton\u2019s motion to set aside the default judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b56-6\">\u00b644 For the foregoing reasons, we reverse the District Court\u2019s order granting Stockton\u2019s motion to set aside the default judgment, and direct the District Court to withdraw its December 27, 2011 order, reinstate the default judgment, and enter a corrected judgment reflecting the remaining amounts owed to Green by Stockton.</p>\n<judges id=\"b56-7\">JUSTICES BAKER, WHEAT, MORRIS, RICE and McKINNON concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b44-11\"> It is undisputed that Gerber was never served with the Complaint or the Summons and, therefore, is not a party to this appeal.

I concur with the Court\u2019s determination that the trial court did not abuse its discretion, but I dissent from the majority\u2019s application of the three-part test used in <em>Essex Ins. Co. v. Moose\u2019s Saloon, Inc., </em>2007 MT 202, \u00b6 16, 338 Mont. 423, 166 P.3d 451, and other opinions.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-10\">\u00b646 The majority opinion makes clear that our case law is confusing, convoluted, and far too complex. It does not need to be. I agree with the Court\u2019s decision to overrule <em>Maulding v. </em>Hardman, 257 Mont. 18, 847 P.2d 292 (1993). I would additionally cease stating the M. R. Civ. P. 60(b)(6) standard as a three-part test as we have done in the past and as the Court does here. See \u00b6\u00b6 41-42. Instead, I would simply instruct the distri ct courts to apply the plain language of Rule 60(b)(6) and to consider whether circumstances other than those listed in the first five subsections justify setting aside the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-11\">\u00b647 As an initial matter, our interpretations correctly incorporate a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>judicial policy that protracted and needless litigation is not favored. The process needs to come to a final resolution. \u201cThere must be some point at which litigation ends and the respective rights between the parties are forever established.\u201d In <em>re Marriage of Weber, </em>2004 MT 211, \u00b6 26, 322 Mont. 341, 96 P.3d 716. Setting aside a judgment is not a matter to be considered lightly. That principle should be incorporated in the criteria to be reviewed, and I agree with the Court in that regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-4\">\u00b648 My concern with the Court\u2019s approach is the use of the \u201cthree-part test.\u201d I do not suggest that a Rule 60(b)(6) movant does not have to demonstrate extraordinary circumstances to be entitled to relief. Requiring extraordinary circumstances is simply another way of saying that there must be some \u201cother reason thatjustifi.es relief.\u201d In fact, demonstrating circumstances that justify relief should be the sole focus of Rule 60(b)(6) analysis. I also do not suggest that a Rule 60(b)(6) motion does not have to be filed within a reasonable time; subsection (c)(1) tells us that it must. It is not necessary, however, that a district court always require a movant to demonstrate \u201cblamelessness.\u201d Its inclusion as an essential element muddles our analysis and detracts from what should be the court\u2019s focus-whether justice requires relief from the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-5\">\u00b649 The language of Rule 60(b)(6) is purposely broad. It is a catch-all provision to cover unforeseen situations not addressed by the first five clauses of Rule 60(b). <em>In re Marriage of Tesch, </em>199 Mont. 240, 245, 648 P.2d 293, 196 (1982) (citing Charles Alan Wright, Arthur Raphael Miller, &amp; Edward H. Cooper, <em>Federal Practice and Procedure </em>vol. 11, \u00a7 2864, 211-12 (1st ed., West 1973)). As the United States Supreme Court noted, \u201cthe language of the \u2018other reason\u2019 clause, for all reasons except the five particularly specified, vests power in courts adequate to enable them to vacate judgments whenever such action is appropriate to accomplish justice.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Klapprott v. United States, </em>335 U.S. 601, 614-15, 69 S. Ct. 384, 390 (1949).</p>\n<p id=\"b57-6\">\u00b650 As the majority opinion notes, we have long held that relief under subsection (6) is only available in extraordinary situations not covered by the first five subsections. <em>Tesch, </em>199 Mont, at 245, 648 P.2d at 293; <em>In re Marriage of Castor, </em>249 Mont. 495, 500, 817 P.2d 665, 668 (1991); <em>Karlen v. Evans, </em>276 Mont. 181, 190, 915 P.2d 232, 238 (1996). That <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>limitation derives from the language of the Rule itself. Rule 60(b)(6) permits a court to grant relief from a judgment for \u201cany <em>other </em>reason that justifies relief.\u201d (Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b58-4\">\u00b651 In <em>Karlen, </em>we considered whether a judgment could be set aside under subsection (6) for an attorney\u2019s mistake, inadvertence, misconduct, or neglect in representing a client, or whether relief in those circumstances must be obtained under subsection (1). Subsection (1) provides that a judgment can be set aside for \u201cmistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect.\u201d We held that subsection (1) will be applicable in ordinary circumstances of attorney error, but that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b58-5\">where the moving party can meet the higher burden of demonstrating extraordinary circumstances, gross neglect or actual misconduct, that the client was blameless and he or she acted to set aside the default within a reasonable period of time, then, under our case law, subsection (6) of Rule 60(b) is available.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ac\"><em>Karlen, </em>276 Mont, at 190, 915 P.2d at 238. Importantly, we did not hold that was the exclusive method of satisfying the requirement of subsection (6).</p>\n<p id=\"b58-6\">\u00b652 In <em>Bahm v. Southworth, </em>2000 MT 244, 301 Mont. 434, 10 P.3d 99, another case involving attorney error, we restated our <em>Karlen </em>holding in unqualified terms as a three-part test. We held that \u201cRule 60(b)(6) applies when the movant demonstrates each of the following elements: 1) extraordinary circumstances including gross neglect or actual misconduct by an attorney; 2) the movant acted to set aside the judgment within a reasonable time period; and 3) the movant was blameless.\u201d <em>Bahm, </em>\u00b6 14. We concluded that the district court properly denied the Rule 60(b)(6) motion because the movant had failed to demonstrate each of the three \u201crequired elements.\u201d <em>Bahm, </em>\u00b6 14. In doing so, we laid the groundwork for our current confusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-7\">\u00b653 As the Court does here, we have since frequently cited the three-part test as the standard to be applied to all Rule 60(b)(6) motions. <em>See Essex Ins. Co., </em>\u00b6 25; <em>In re Paternity of C.T.E.-H., </em>2004 MT 307, \u00b6 45, 323 Mont. 498, 101 P.3d 254; <em>In re Marriage of Orcutt, </em>2011 MT 107, \u00b6 12, 360 Mont. 353, 253 P.3d 884. This three-part test needlessly confuses Rule 60(b)(6) analysis and distracts from what the trial court should be focusing on; whether the circumstances justify relief. By using the three-part test, we have needlessly narrowed the application of a rule that was intended to address a wide range of unknown circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-8\">\u00b654 Our holding in <em>Karlen </em>did not set forth the exclusive path for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>relief under Rule 60(b)(6). Yet our repeated recitation of the three-part test has made it so. As noted above, I believe that the sole focus should be on whether the circumstances justify relief. Other \u201celements\u201d are unnecessary when considering the merits of a Rule 60(b)(6)motion. The requirement that a Rule 60(b)(6) motion must be filed within a reasonable time used to be mandated by Rule 60(b)(6) itself. That requirement is now set forth as Rule 60(c)(1). Thus its inclusion in the analysis of the merits of a Rule 60(b)(6) motion is redundant and unnecessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-4\">\u00b655 Additionally, requiring a movant to prove \u201cblamelessness\u201d should be limited to cases in which the circumstances that allegedly justify relief are an attorney\u2019s mistake, inadvertence, misconduct, or neglect in the representation of a client. In those cases, like in <em>Karlen, </em>the movant must demonstrate blamelessness because otherwise subsection (1) would be applicable. However, the \u201cblameless\u201d component unnecessarily constricts our review in other cases. While a party\u2019s fault or lack of good faith can certainly be a factor in the court\u2019s consideration of whether the circumstances justify relief, the wide array of \u201cother circumstances\u201d that could conceivably justify relief under Rule 60(b)(6) will not always require the movant to demonstrate \u201cblamelessness.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b59-5\">\u00b656 This approach accurately reflects our holdings before the three-part test led us astray. It is also consistent with the approach taken by the federal courts, which do not use a three-part test when considering the analogous federal rule. <em>See Klapprott, </em>335 U.S. at 614-15, 69 S. Ct. at <em>390; Ackermann v. United States, </em>340 U.S. 193, 197-200, 71 S. Ct. 209, 211-12 (1950); <em>Liljeberg v. Health Servs. Acquisition Corp., </em>486 U.S. 847, 863-64, 108 S. Ct. 2194, 2204-05 (1988); <em>Gonzalez v. Crosby, </em>545 U.S. 524, 534-35, 125 S. Ct. 2641, 2649-50 (2005); <em>Mackey v. Hoffman, </em>682 F.3d 1247, 1250-51 (9th Cir. 2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b59-6\">\u00b657 Rule 60(b)(6) was meant to be flexible and malleable to accommodate unforeseeable situations. A catch-all provision, by its very nature, is not meant to be limited. The three-part test attempts to inject certainty into a rule that was meant to address uncertain circumstances. I would not apply the three-part test and would instead instruct the trial courts to apply the plain language of the Rule. Most situations will be covered by the first five subsections of the Rule. In extraordinary cases that are not covered by the first five subsections, however, the trial court should be given the discretion to consider <em>all </em>of the relevant factors and not just those that we have previously identified as pertinent. Our prior cases serve as guidance to help <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>identify relevant considerations in different circumstances. The trial courts\u2019 analysis should focus simply on whether the circumstances justify relief. While this standard is somewhat vague, it is purposely and necessarily so.
