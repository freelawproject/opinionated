We reverse in part and remand with directions to the Youth Court to hold a new restitution hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-25\">\u00b62 We restate the issue on appeal as follows: Did the Youth Court commit plain error when it concluded that K.E.G. was jointly and severally liable for the full amount of restitution for damages caused <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>by the youths, without considering K.E.G.\u2019s ability to pay that restitution?</p>\n<p id=\"b398-4\">PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">\u00b63 Between December 22, 2011, and January 1, 2012, the Billings Police Department responded to over 200 reports of vandalism. During this eleven-day period, vandals shot the windows out of homes and vehicles with air guns, damaged vehicles with baseball bats, and set two cars on fire. An investigation led by local school resource officers indicated that K.E.G., a fifteen-year-old male, had taken part in the vandalism.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-6\">\u00b64 On January 10, 2012, K.E.G. and his mother met with Officer Jerry Smidt of the Billings Police Department. K.E.G. waived his rights and provided a statement to Officer Smidt. He admitted to committing acts of vandalism on December 26 and December 27, but stated he did not participate on any other date. According to an affidavit submitted by the Yellowstone County Attorney, K.E.G. admitted that he had \u201chit two windows with the gun\u201d and \u201cfour or five windows with the bat\u201d on the first night and that he had \u201chit five windows with the BB gun and three with the bat\u201d on the second night.</p>\n<p id=\"AEr\">\u00b65 Approximately two weeks later, the county attorney filed a petition alleging that K.E.G. was a delinquent youth for having committed criminal mischief (common scheme), a felony, in violation of \u00a7\u00a7 45-6-101 and 45-2-101(8), MCA. Other youths involved in the vandalism similarly were charged. K.E.G. denied the State\u2019s allegations at his initial appearance on February 9, 2012. During a change of plea hearing in late March, K.E.G. admitted to having committed criminal mischief, common scheme, as alleged in the State\u2019s petition. The youth then detailed the acts of vandalism he committed on December 26 and December 27. The Youth Court accepted KE.G.\u2019s admission and change of plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-7\">\u00b66 Because K.E.G. contested the State\u2019s attempt to hold him jointly and severally liable for all damages caused during the eleven-day period of vandalism, the parties briefed the issue of restitution prior to the court\u2019s dispositional hearing. K.E.G. argued that, since he had admitted to participating in only two of the eleven nights of vandalism, \u201chis restitution should be jointly and severally liable for only December 26th and 27th\u201d in the amount of $16,020.63. The State countered by asserting that the Youth Court should \u201cimpose restitution in the amount of $78,702.09\u201d pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 45-6-101(4) and 45-2-101(8), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>\u00b67 The Youth Court held a hearing on restitution and disposition on April 23, 2012. K.E.G. and the county attorney presented arguments on the proper amount of restitution. At the hearing, the Youth Court made the following comments:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-4\">With regard to restitution, the problem of course is that while you may not have been present at every act of criminal mischief, <em>you have admitted to being responsible as part and parcel of a common scheme, </em>and the common scheme asserted in the petition was the entire common scheme, and all of the days of this criminal mischief that went on with the various participants. And it seems to me that <em>because of that admission, </em>you should in fact be jointly] and severally liable with any other defendants that are-or youth that are found to be responsible for the damage caused in this matter. And I am going to order that you be responsible for that restitution in the amount of $78,702.09. Now, I understand that in five years as a youth, <em>it will be nearly impossible, </em>unless some-something befalls upon you financially for you to pay that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-5\">And my hope is that you will at least make some payments with restitution to make amends for the problems that you have caused basically unsuspecting people in our community.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b399-6\">(Emphasis added.) The Youth Court did not inquire into the extent of K.E.G.\u2019s assets or his prospects for future earnings.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-7\">\u00b68 After the hearing, the court entered a dispositional order that adjudicated K.E.G. a delinquent youth for having committed criminal mischief (common scheme), a felony, and committed him to the Department of Corrections until his eighteenth birthday, with recommended placement at Pine Hills Youth Correctional Facility. The court also ordered K.E.G. to \u201cpay restitution in the amount of $78,702.09 ... joint and several in monthly payments of not less than $50.00 ... or 50% of his net wages whichever is greater, with the first payment due within 30 days.\u201d The Youth Court retained jurisdiction over K.E.G. for restitution purposes until his twenty-first birthday, or until the restitution is paid in full. K.E.G. appeals from the portion of the dispositional order that ordered him to pay $78,702.09 in restitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-8\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b399-9\">\u00b69 The court\u2019s determination of the appropriate measure of restitution is a question of law, reviewed for correctness. <em>State v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number><em>Johnson, </em>2011 MT 116, \u00b6 13, 360 Mont. 443, 254 P.3d 578 (citing <em>State v. Pritchett, </em>2000 MT 261, \u00b6 18, 302 Mont. 1, 11 P.3d 539).</p>\n<p id=\"b400-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">\u00b610 <em>Did the Youth Court commit plain error when it concluded that K.E. G. was jointly and severally liable for the full amount of restitution for damages caused by the youths, without considering KE.G.\u2019s ability to pay that </em>restitution?</p>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">\u00b611 K.E.G. argues that he should be responsible to pay restitution for the amount of damage that was caused only on the nights during which he participated in the vandalism and that the joint and several liability for restitution imposed under the criminal mischief statute should not be applied to youthful offenders. The State argues that, pursuant to \u00a7 45-6-101(4), MCA, \u201cthe Youth Court was authorized by the Youth Court Act to aggregate the damages, and thus to order K.E.G. to pay restitution, jointly and severally, with the right of contribution, to all of the victims for all ten days of the common scheme.\u201d The State maintains that requiring full restitution imposes accountability and contributes to the youth\u2019s rehabilitation, arguing that it is not retributive simply because the youth will not be able to pay the full amount before the court loses jurisdiction over him. K.E.G. responds to this argument by pointing out that the Youth Court recognized it would be impossible for him to meet the restitution requirement, asserting that \u201c[i]f Mont. Code Ann. \u00a7 45-6-101(4) is the basis for the amount of restitution owed by K.E.G., the case should be remanded for a full consideration of KE.G.\u2019s ability to pay\u201d $78,702.09 in restitution. K.E.G. claims that the Youth Court failed to fully consider KE.G.\u2019s ability to pay that amount as required by \u00a7 45-6-101(2), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-7\">\u00b612 The Montana Youth Court Act states that restitution is to be ordered by the youth court in \u201cappropriate cases.\u201d Section 41-5-102(2)(c), MCA. When determining whether restitution is appropriate, the youth court may consider a number of factors, \u201cin addition to any other evidence.\u201d Section 41-5-1521(1), MCA. Those factors include \u201cthe age of the youth, the ability of the youth to pay, the ability of the parents or guardians to pay, the amount of damage to the victim, and legal remedies of the victim.\u201d <em>In the Matter of T.M.R., </em>2006 MT 246, \u00b6 14, 334 Mont. 64, 144 P.3d 809 (citing \u00a7 41-5-1521, MCA). Once the youth court determines that restitution is appropriate, it may order the youth to pay restitution. Sections 41-5-1513(l)(a), -1512(l)(d), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>\u00b613 In this case, the Youth Court determined that restitution was appropriate and that K.E.G. should be held jointly and severally liable pursuant to \u00a7 45-6-101(4), MCA. Although the Dissent correctly notes that \u201cK.E.G. has not been \u2018convicted\u2019 of\u2019 violating the statute, it errs in concluding that this statute therefore \u201cis inapplicable.\u201d Dissent, \u00b6 40. The Youth Court Act expressly authorizes the Youth Court to order a delinquent youth to pay restitution \u201cfor damages that result from the offense for which the youth is disposed . . . .\u201d <em>In re T.M.R., </em>\u00b6 18 (quoting \u00a7\u00a7 41-5-1512(1)(d), -1513(1)(a), MCA). The offense for which K.E.G. was disposed was \u00a7 45-6-101(4), MCA, which provides that \u201c[ajmounts involved in criminal mischiefs committed pursuant to a common scheme or the same transaction, whether against the public or the same person or several persons, may be aggregated in determining pecuniary loss.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b401-4\">\u00b614 K.E.G. admitted to committing the offense of criminal mischief pursuant to a common scheme, which is \u201ca series of acts or omissions motivated by a purpose to accomplish a single criminal objective or by a common purpose or plan that results in the repeated commission of the same offense ....\u201d Section 45-2-101(8), MCA. Because K.E.G. acknowledged that he acted as part of a common criminal plan that resulted in 200 reports of vandalism against homes and vehicles in Billings between December 22, 2011, and January 1, 2012, the Youth Court was statutorily authorized to impose restitution for the aggregate damages that resulted from that common scheme during the time period charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">\u00b615 <em>In re T.M.R. </em>does not counsel a different result. In that case, we noted that the <em>adult sentencing statutes </em>did not apply to a disposition under the Youth Court Act, and thus the Court was compelled to \u201cfill in the gap left by the legislature\u201d in determining the amount of restitution that should be imposed. <em>In re T.M.R., </em>\u00b6\u00b6 16-18. In this case, the District Court did not apply adult sentencing statutes and there is no gap. Rather, aggregation of damages is allowed by the criminal statute defining \u201cthe offense for which the youth is disposed,\u201d for which the Youth Court Act expressly authorizes restitution. Sections 41-5-1512(1)(d), -1513(1)(a), MCA. Our conclusion is not altered by construing the Youth Court Act\u2019s restitution provision \u201cin an \u2018equitable fashion\u2019\u201d in order to effectuate \u201c\u2018the intent of the legislature,\u201d\u2019 <em>In re T.M.R., </em>\u00b6 18, since the expressed purposes of the Youth Court Act include restitution and accountability through \u201cimmediate\u201d consequences of a youth\u2019s actions. Section 41-5-102(2)(a), (c), MCA. As vandalism sprees are not uncommonly the province of young, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>Immature offenders, we would do a disservice to the legislature\u2019s intent were we to exempt youth from this application of the criminal mischief statute when they admit to participating in a common scheme.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-4\">\u00b616 Nonetheless, while the aggregation of damage may well be appropriate to achieve the accountability goals of the Youth Court Act, both that Act and the applicable criminal law call for an examination of the offender\u2019s ability to pay. Sections 41-5-1521(l)(b), 45-6-101(2), MCA. The transcript of the dispositional and restitution hearing reflects almost no discussion of KE.G.\u2019s ability to pay, except the Youth Court\u2019s acknowledgment that it would be \u201cnearly impossible\u201d for him to meet the obligation, but that the court hoped he would \u201cat least make some payments.\u201d Since the record also reflects that K.E.G. did not object to a restitution order without evidence of his ability to pay, we consider whether the issue is appropriate for review on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"AfD\">\u00b617 We generally \u201crefuse to review on appeal an issue to which the party failed to object at the trial court.\u201d <em>State v. Kotwicki, </em>2007 MT 17, \u00b6 8, 335 Mont. 344, 151 P.3d 892 (citing <em>State v. Lenihan, </em>184 Mont. 338, 341, 602 P.2d 997, 999 (1979)). While we have recognized an exception to this general rule for review of an illegal sentence, <em>Lenihan, </em>184 Mont, at 343, 602 P.2d at 1000, we do not apply that exception here, since the failure to consider a defendant\u2019s ability to pay amounts only \u201cto an objectionable sentence,\u201d which we have refused to consider absent a contemporaneous objection. <em>Kotwicki, </em>\u00b6 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">\u00b618 Despite the absence of contemporaneous objection, we will conduct \u201cplain error\u201d review if an alleged error \u201cimplicate^] a defendant\u2019s fundamental constitutional rights and if our failure to review the claimed error may result in a manifest miscarriage of justice, may leave unsettled the question of the fundamental fairness of the trial or proceedings, or may compromise the integrity of the judicial process.\u201d <em>In the Matter of C.T.P., </em>2004 MT 63, \u00b6 15, 320 Mont. 279, 87 P.3d 399.</p>\n<p id=\"Auq\">\u00b619 The Dissent correctly points out that we have reserved plain error review for questions implicating constitutional rights rather than statutory-based claims. Dissent, \u00b6 30. The issue in this case, however, does have constitutional implications. Under Montana\u2019s Constitution, a person under eighteen has \u201call the fundamental rights of [an adult] unless specifically precluded by laws which enhance the protection of such persons.\u201d Mont. Const, art. II, \u00a7 15. We have recognized that a youth in the youth court system facing \u201ca disposition different from an adult who has committed the same offenses\u201d is \u201cnot similarly situated\u201d to the adult with respect to Montana\u2019s sentencing laws. <em>In re S.M.K.</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number><em>S.H, </em>2012 MT 281, \u00b6 28, 367 Mont. 176, 290 P.3d 718. The disposition in a youth court case should effectuate the Youth Court Act\u2019s purposes to prevent and reduce youth delinquency through a system that does not seek retribution but that provides consistent and enforceable consequences designed to accomplish a number of objectives, including rehabilitation of the youth, protection of the community, and restitution to victims. Section 41-5-102(2), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-4\">\u00b620 The criminal mischief statute expressly provides that, before a court may impose restitution, it must \u201cdetermine the manner and amount of restitution <em>after full consideration of the convicted person\u2019s ability to pay the restitution.\u201d </em>Section 45-6-101(2), MCA (emphasis added). That subsection of the statute also requires that full payment of restitution \u201cmust be made prior to the release of state jurisdiction\u201d over the offender.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">\u00b621 Other courts have recognized the importance of a realistic, defined restitution order for juvenile offenders to \u201cpermit the juvenile to feel that he or she is gainfully making amends for past transgressions.\u201d <em>In re Laurance S., </em>742 N.W.2d 484, 489 (Neb. 2007) (citing <em>State v. Kristopher G., </em>500 S.E.2d 519, 522 (W. Va. 1997) (stating that \u201c[a]ny restitution award should ... be set in an amount that is within the realistic ability of the children to pay within a reasonable period of time, so that they can complete a probationary period, put... events behind them, and move forward\u201d)). The \u201csalutary purpose\u201d an appropriate restitution order serves by \u201c\u2018making the offender understand that he has harmed not merely society in the abstract but also individual human beings, and that he has a responsibility to\u2019 the victim ..., would be directly undermined by the imposition of a restitution order that the juvenile is financially unable to pay.\u201d <em>In re Laurance </em>S., 742 N.W.2d at 489 (quoting <em>In re Brian S., </em>181 Cal. Rptr. 778, 780 (Cal. Ct. App. 1982)). Restitution may take on constitutional dimension in a youth case when the imposition fails to consider the enhanced protections embodied in the Youth Court Act\u2019s objectives of promoting the development of youth and providing a program of supervision and rehabilitation that avoids retribution and keeps youth from becoming adult offenders. Section 41-5-102, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-6\">\u00b622  Given the significant amount of restitution at issue in this case, the youth\u2019s commitment to Pine Hills, and the potential long-term consequences of the restitution order, KE.G.\u2019s future earning capacity and any assets available to immediately put toward restitution were key considerations to determining whether his disposition would meet the objectives of the Youth Court Act and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>requirements of \u00a7 45-6-101(2), MCA. Under these circumstances, we conclude that the Youth Court\u2019s failure to fully consider KE.G.\u2019s ability to pay prior to imposing aggregate restitution may leave unsettled the fundamental fairness to K.E.G. of the proceedings against him and therefore constituted plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-4\">\u00b623 For the foregoing reasons, the Youth Court\u2019s April 25,2012 order is reversed in part and remanded with directions to the Youth Court to hold a new restitution hearing pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 45-6-101(2) and 41-5-1521(1), MCA, to consider KE.G.\u2019s ability to pay the full amount of restitution.</p>\n<judges id=\"b404-5\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES COTTER, WHEAT and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b404-6\">JUSTICE McKINNON,</author>\n<p id=\"A-Z\">concurring in part and dissenting in part. \u00b624 I concur in the Court\u2019s decision to reverse the Youth Court\u2019s order and remand for the entry of a corrected restitution amount. I respectfully dissent, however, from the Court\u2019s analysis in reaching this conclusion. First, I believe the Court has improperly resolved this case based on a legal theory that K.E.G. neither raised in the Youth Court nor relied on in his appeal before this Court. Second, I disagree with the Court\u2019s application of adult sentencing statutes to youth cases, where the Montana Youth Court Act has not expressly authorized the application of adult statutes. Finally, with respect to the legal theory that K.E.G. actually did raise in this appeal, it is my view that, under our caselaw and applicable statutes, K.E.G. cannot be required to pay restitution for damages which he did not admit he caused and which the State never proved he caused. I address these three points in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-7\">I. The Court\u2019s Sua Sponte \u201cPlain Error\u201d Review</p>\n<p id=\"b404-8\">\u00b625 \u201cIt is perhaps our most fundamental rule of appellate review that, with rare exception, we will not consider an issue or claim that was not properly preserved for appeal.\u201d <em>State v. Norman, </em>2010 MT 253, \u00b6 16, 358 Mont. 252, 244 P.3d 737. To properly preserve an issue for appeal, it is necessary that the issue be timely raised in the first instance in the trial court. <em>Norman, </em>\u00b6 16. One oft-stated reason for this rule is that \u201cit is fundamentally unfair to fault the trial court for failing to rule correctly on an issue it was never given the opportunity to consider.\u201d <em>State v. West, </em>2008 MT 338, \u00b6 16, 346 Mont. 244, 194 P.3d 683 (internal quotation marks omitted); <em>see also e.g. State v. Clary, </em>2012 MT 26, \u00b6 19, 364 Mont. 53, 270 P.3d 88 (\u201c[W]e will not put a district court in error for failing to address an issue or an argument that was not made before it.\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)); <em>State v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number><em>Evans, </em>2012 MT 115, \u00b6 26, 365 Mont. 163, 280 P.3d 871 (\u201cWhile Evans faults the State and the District Court for the claimed errors listed above, neither was afforded an opportunity to correct or explain them because Evans made no contemporaneous objection.\u201d). \u201cAbove all else,\u201d however, \u201cthe rationale underlying the timely-objection rule is judicial economy and bringing alleged errors to the attention of each court involved, so that actual error can be prevented or corrected at the first opportunity.\u201d <em>West, </em>\u00b6 17 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b405-4\">\u00b626 One of the \u201crare\u201d and \u201cnarrow\u201d exceptions to the timely-objection rule is the doctrine of plain error review. <em>West, </em>f \u00b6 19-20; <em>Norman, </em>\u00b6 16. This doctrine is founded on the principle that \u201c \u2018appellate courts have the inherent duty to interpret the constitution and to protect individual rights set forth in the constitution and necessarily have the correlative authority to invoke the plain error doctrine in order to carry out those duties.\u2019 \u201d <em>West, </em>\u00b6 23 (brackets omitted) (quoting <em>State v. Finley, </em>276 Mont. 126, 134, 915 P.2d 208, 213 (1996)). Given our \u201cinherent power and paramount obligation to interpret Montana\u2019s Constitution and to protect the various rights set forth in that document,\u201d we may discretionarily review \u201cclaimed errors that implicate a criminal defendant\u2019s fundamental constitutional rights.\u201d <em>West, </em>\u00b6 23 (internal quotation marks omitted). We use this doctrine \u201csparingly, on a case-by-case basis,\u201d and only where failing to review the claimed error \u201cmay result in a manifest miscarriage of justice, may leave unsettled the question of the fundamental fairness of the trial or proceedings, or may compromise the integrity of the judicial process.\u201d <em>West, </em>\u00b6 23 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">\u00b627 The Court today mistakenly applies the plain error doctrine in two ways. First, the \u201cclaimed error\u201d the Court identifies is the Youth Court\u2019s failure to consider KE.G.\u2019s ability to pay the aggregate restitution.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Court cites the ability-to-pay requirement contained in \u00a7 45-6-101(2), MCA, and then reverses the Youth Court\u2019s restitution order because \u201cthe Youth Court\u2019s failure to fully consider KE.G.\u2019s ability to pay prior to imposing aggregate restitution ... constituted plain error.\u201d Opinion, \u00b6\u00b6 20, 22. That, however, is not the claimed error K.E.G. raises on appeal-much less an error K.E.G. asks us to review under the plain error doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-6\">\u00b628 K.E.G. admitted in the Youth Court that he engaged in criminal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>mischief (common scheme) within the timeframe alleged in the County Attorney\u2019s Petition-i.e., \u201cfrom about December 22,2011, to January 1, 2012\u201d-but not over this entire timeframe. K.E.G. admitted to breaking vehicle windows on December 26 and 27,2011, but he denied engaging in such activity on any other night between December 22 and January 1. Accordingly, K.E.G. acknowledged that he is jointly and severally responsible to pay restitution in the amount of $16,020.63, which represents the combined damages that he and the other youths caused on December 26 and 27. K.E.G. maintained, however, that his restitution liability does not extend to the vandalism that other youths caused on other nights when K.E.G. was not present. His basis for this argument: the applicable statutes and this Court\u2019s caselaw require a causal connection between an offender\u2019s unlawful conduct and his restitution obligation, and there is no causal connection between KE.G.\u2019s unlawful conduct on December 26 and 27 and the damages that occurred on the other nights between December 22 and January 1. At no point did K.E.G. argue that the Youth Court must consider his ability to pay the restitution amount. Even when the Youth Court imposed the aggregate restitution of $78,702.09, K.E.G. did not object that the court was first required to consider his ability to pay this amount. Correspondingly, on appeal, KE.G.\u2019s stated issue is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-4\">Whether the district court erred when it concluded that K.E.G. was joint and severally liable for the full amount of restitution for damage that occurred over the course of ten consecutive nights where K.E.G. admitted to committing acts of Criminal Mischief (Common Scheme) but only admitted to being present for two nights.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">As he did in the Youth Court, K.E.G. argues on appeal that there must be a causal connection between his unlawful conduct and his restitution obligation. K.E.G. does not invoke plain error review of this issue, given that he preserved the issue in the Youth Court by raising it there.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-6\">\u00b629 In the vast majority of cases where the defendant-appellant has actually requested plain error review of an unpreserved claim, this Court routinely has denied that request, noting that we apply the doctrine sparingly. <em>See e.g. Evans, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 24-28; <em>State v. Lacey, </em>2012 MT 52, \u00b6\u00b6 14, 21-26, 364 Mont. 291, 272 P.3d 1288; <em>State v. Daniels, </em>2011 MT 278, \u00b6\u00b6 29-33, 362 Mont. 426, 265 P.3d 623; <em>State v.

In the present case, as explained, K.E.G. has not requested that we exercise plain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>error review. Nor has he raised \u201cability to pay\u201d as an issue on appeal. Thus, the Court\u2019s choice to reach the ability-to-pay issue nonetheless, although it was not presented and argued by the parties, disregards our rules and is contrary to the policy of applying plain error review sparingly. The Court\u2019s approach also \u201cignores a fundamental premise of our adversarial system: that appellate courts do not sit as self-directed boards of legal inquiry and research, but essentially as arbiters of legal questions presented and argued by the parties before them.\u201d <em>Knox v. Serv. Employees Intl. </em>Union,___ U.S._, 132 S. Ct. 2277, 2298 (2012) (Sotomayor &amp; Ginsburg, JJ., concurring in the judgment) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). \u201cOur refusal to abide by standard rules of appellate practice is unfair to the [Youth Court], whose judgment the Court vacates, and especially to the [appellee] here, who suffers a loss in this Court without <em>ever </em>having an opportunity to address the merits of the statutory question the Court decides.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Jefferson v. </em>Upton,_U.S._, 130 S. Ct. 2217, 2227 (2010) (Scalia &amp; Thomas, JJ., dissenting) (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"AlV\">\u00b630 There is a second reason the Court\u2019s application of plain error review in this case is mistaken. That doctrine applies to the review of alleged errors that implicate a defendant\u2019s fundamental <em>constitutional </em>rights. <em>State v. Taylor, </em>2010 MT 94, \u00b6 13, 356 Mont. 167, 231 P.3d 79; <em>accord </em>Opinion, \u00b6 18. We do not apply the doctrine to statutory-based claims because the Legislature has enacted two statutes (specifically, \u00a7\u00a7 46-20-104(2) and -701, MCA) that \u201cuniquely restrict! ] review of errors not objected to at trial,\u201d and \u201cit would be incongruous for this Court to review [a] statutory-based claim notwithstanding the statutory-based prohibition on our doing so.\u201d <em>West, </em>\u00b6 22 (first brackets in original, internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b408-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>\u00b631 Here, K.E.G. has not alleged in the Youth Court or in this Court that the Youth Court\u2019s imposition of restitution, without first considering his ability to pay, rises to a constitutional violation. He cites neither the United States Constitution nor the Montana Constitution anywhere in his briefs. Nevertheless, the Court decides, sua sponte, that the imposition of a restitution obligation without consideration of the offender\u2019s ability to pay has \u201cconstitutional implications\u201d and \u201cconstitutional dimension\u201d-at least \u201cin a youth case.\u201d Opinion, \u00b6\u00b6 19, 21. In essence, without briefing or argument on the point, the Court announces a constitutional right of youths to receive consideration of their ability to pay-whether they ask for it or not-before the youth court may impose a restitution obligation. Opinion, \u00b6\u00b6 19, 21. Notably, this new right appears to be in tension with the Youth Court Act, which states that \u201cthe ability of the youth to pay\u201d is a factor that \u201cmay\u201d (not \u201cmust\u201d or \u201cshall\u201d) be considered in determining whether restitution is appropriate. Section 41-5-1521(l)(b), MCA. In any event, I do not believe that sua sponte application of our plain error doctrine is a proper vehicle for deciding a constitutional question that (1) the appellant has not raised and (2) requires us to announce a new constitutional right.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-4\">\u00b632 For the foregoing reasons, I dissent from our decision to \u201crestate\u201d the issue on appeal so that we may sua sponte exercise plain error review. Opinion, \u00b6 2. The Court\u2019s \u201crestated\u201d issue was not raised in the Youth Court or in KE.G.\u2019s opening brief on appeal, and the Court\u2019s ensuing analysis misapplies our plain error doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">II. The Court\u2019s Application of Adult Sentencing Statutes to a Youth</p>\n<p id=\"b408-6\">\u00b633 Three statutes within the Youth Court Act authorize the youth court to impose a restitution obligation upon a youth: \u00a7 41-5-1304(1), MCA (where a consent adjustment has been reached without the filing of a petition), \u00a7 41-5-1512(1), MCA (following an adjudicatory finding that the youth is in need of intervention or has violated a consent adjustment), and \u00a7 41-5-1513(1), MCA (following an adjudicatory finding that the youth is delinquent, as is the case here). Section 41-5-1521(1), MCA, in turn, specifically provides for the manner in which such restitution is to be determined. It directs the youth court as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-7\">In determining whether restitution ... is appropriate in a particular case, the following factors <em>may </em>be considered in addition to any other evidence:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-8\">(a) the age of the youth;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>(b) the ability of the youth to pay;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-4\">(c) the ability of the parents, guardian, or those that contributed to the youth\u2019s delinquency or need for intervention to pay;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-5\">(d) the amount of damage to the victim; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-6\">(e) legal remedies of the victim. However, the ability of the victim or the victim\u2019s insurer to stand any loss may not be considered.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b409-7\">Section 41-5-1521(1), MCA (emphasis added). Therefore, based on this provision, the youth\u2019s ability to pay, as well as that of the youth\u2019s parents, is one of several factors that the youth court \u201cmay\u201d consider in determining whether restitution is appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-8\">\u00b634 Any restitution obligation in youth court proceedings imposed pursuant to in the adult criminal statutes and sentencing provisions of Titles 45 and 46 of the Montana Code Annotated directly conflicts with these specific provisions of the Youth Court Act. Indeed, we have previously refused to apply adult sentencing statutes to a restitution obligation imposed on a delinquent youth under the Youth Court Act. Our decision in <em>In re </em>T.M.R., 2006 MT 246, 334 Mont. 64, 144 P.3d 809, involved a youth (T.M.R.) who had been adjudicated delinquent. He was placed on probation and ordered to pay restitution pursuant to \u00a7 41-5-1513(1), MCA. His case was then transferred to district court for supervisory responsibility pursuant to \u00a7 41-5-208, MCA. T.M.R., \u00b6 14. The issue on appeal concerned the amount of restitution T.M.R. owed. The State advocated for the definition of \u201cpecuniary loss\u201d found in \u00a7 46-18-243, MCA, but we agreed with T.M.R. that it was not appropriate to apply this adult sentencing statute. <em>T.M.R., </em>\u00b6 16. We noted that, pursuant to \u00a7 41-5-208(4), MCA, if a youth violates a disposition imposed under \u00a7 41-5-1512 or -1513, MCA, then the district court may impose the adult restitution statutes, including \u00a7 46-18-243, MCA. <em>T.M.R., </em>\u00b6 16. However, because there was no evidence that T.M.R. had violated his disposition conditions, we held that he was not subject to sentencing under the adult statutes. T.M.R., \u00b6 17. Implicit in our analysis was the principle that the adult restitution statutes do not apply to youths unless there is express authority for such application in the Youth Court Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-9\">\u00b635 The Court\u2019s attempts at distinguishing <em>T.M.R. </em>from the present case fall short. First, the Court states that the Youth Court did not apply adult sentencing statutes to KE.G.\u2019s disposition. Opinion, \u00b6 15. But that is exactly what the Youth Court did. The purported authority for the Youth Court to impose an aggregated restitution obligation on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>K.E.G. is \u00a7 45-6-101, MCA. The first subsection of this statute sets forth the elements of the offense. For purposes here, \u201c[a] person commits the offense of criminal mischief if the person knowingly or purposely injures, damages, or destroys any property of another or public property without consent.\u201d Section 45-6-101(l)(a), MCA. The remainder of the statute is dedicated to punishment and sentencing considerations:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b410-4\">\u2022 Subsection (2) provides that a person who has been \u201cconvicted\u201d of criminal mischief must be ordered to make restitution in an amount and manner to be set by the court. As the Court concedes, and as I discuss below, K.E.G. has not been \u201cconvicted\u201d of criminal mischief. Opinion, \u00b6 13; \u00a7 41-5-106, MCA.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b410-5\">\u2022 Subsection (3) provides that a person who has been \u201cconvicted\u201d of criminal mischief shall be fined not to exceed $1,500, imprisoned in the county jail for any term not to exceed six months, or both; but if the offender causes \u201cpecuniary loss\u201d in excess of $1,500, then the offender shall be fined an amount not to exceed $50,000, imprisoned in the state prison for a term not to exceed ten years, or both.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b410-6\">\u2022 Subsection (4) provides that, in determining \u201cpecuniary loss,\u201d amounts involved in criminal mischiefs committed pursuant to a common scheme or the same transaction may be aggregated.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b410-7\">\u2022 Lastly, subsection (5) provides that a person \u201cconvicted\u201d of criminal mischief involving property owned or administered by the Department of Fish, Wildlife, and Parks shall forfeit any current hunting, fishing, or trapping license issued by the State and the privilege to hunt, fish, or trap in the State for at least 24 months.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b410-8\">It is clear, then, that by applying subsection (4) of \u00a7 45-6-101, MCA, the Youth Court (and now this Court) applied an adult sentencing statute. As <em>T.M.R. </em>holds, adult statutes are not applicable to youths unless the Youth Court Act expressly provides otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-9\">\u00b636 The Court\u2019s second attempted distinction between the present case and <em>T.M.R. </em>is that the Youth Court Act authorizes restitution for damages that result from the offense for which the youth is disposed, and \u201c[t]he offense for which K.E.G. was disposed was \u00a7 45-6-101(4), MCA.\u201d Opinion, \u00b6\u00b6 13,15. As explained above, however, subsection (4) does not set forth the \u201coffense\u201d of criminal mischief. That offense is set forth in subsection (1) of the statute, which states: \u201cA person commits the offense of criminal mischief if the person knowingly or purposely ....\u201d Subsection (4), in turn, merely sets forth a sentencing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>consideration-namely, that in determining whether the offender is subject to an enhanced punishment of $50,000 and ten years in state prison, amounts involved in criminal mischiefs committed pursuant to a common scheme or the same transaction may be aggregated in determining pecuniary loss.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Aggregation of pecuniary loss under subsection (4), in other words, simply determines an adult offender\u2019s sentence exposure for the offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-4\">\u00b637 We have recognized that there is more than an \u201cartificial distinction\u201d between a disposition imposed under the Youth Court Act and a sentence imposed under the Montana Criminal Code. <em>See In re B.L.T., </em>258 Mont. 468, 473, 853 P.2d 1226, 1229 (1993). The special treatment afforded youths under the Act is reflected in the express legislative purposes set forth in \u00a7 41-5-102, MCA, and in the myriad statutes (noted below) that distinguish youth proceedings from adult criminal proceedings. The Court\u2019s approach today in finding that an adult criminal sentencing statute gave the Youth Court authority to impose a restitution obligation on a youth, Opinion, \u00b6\u00b6 13-14, undermines the legislative intent to treat youths differently than adult offenders.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">\u00b638 The Youth Court Act exists to address youth delinquency through a mechanism distinct and apart from the adult criminal justice system. <em>See </em>\u00a7\u00a7 41-5-102, -106, MCA. The legislative purposes of the Act, as stated in \u00a7 41-5-102, MCA, are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b411-6\">1. to preserve the unity and welfare of the family whenever possible, and to provide for the care, protection, and wholesome mental and physical development of the youth;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b411-7\">2. to prevent and reduce youth delinquency through a system that does not seek retribution, but that provides: consequences for the youth\u2019s actions; a program of supervision, care, rehabilitation, detention, competency development, and community protection for the youth before he becomes an adult offender; restitution in appropriate cases; and, if removal from the home is necessary, the ability of the youth to maintain ethnic, cultural, or religious heritage whenever appropriate;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b411-8\">3. to achieve these purposes in a family environment if possible, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>separating the youth from the parents only when necessary for the welfare of the youth or for the safety and protection of the community; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-4\">4. to provide judicial procedures in which the parties are ensured a fair, accurate hearing and recognition and enforcement of their constitutional and statutory rights.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">The youth courts were established to fulfill these purposes. Section 41-5-201, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-6\">\u00b639 That the Legislature intended youths to be treated differently than adult offenders is apparent from various facets of the Youth Court Act. For example, no youth may be charged with or convicted of any crime in any court except as provided in the Act. Section 41-5-106, MCA; <em>see also </em>\u00a7 41-5-206(4), MCA. With limited exceptions, the youth court has exclusive original jurisdiction of all proceedings in which a youth is alleged to be delinquent. Section 41-5-203(1), MCA. A \u201cdelinquent youth\u201d is a youth who has committed \u201can offense that, if committed by an adult, would constitute a criminal offense.\u201d Section 41-5-103(ll)(a), MCA. Most importantly, a finding that a youth is delinquent is not a criminal conviction: \u201cNo adjudication upon the status of any youth in the jurisdiction of the court shall operate to impose any of the civil disability imposed on a person by reason of conviction of a criminal offense, nor shall such adjudication be deemed a criminal conviction.\u201d Section 41-5-106, MCA. Also, \u201c[n]o placement of any youth in any state youth correctional facility under [the Youth Court Act] shall be deemed commitment to a penal institution.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>Section 41-5-106, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-4\">\u00b640 As discussed, the statute this Court cites as authority for KE.G.\u2019s restitution obligation provides, in pertinent part: \u201cA person convicted of criminal mischief must be ordered to make restitution in an amount and manner to be set by the court. The court shall determine the manner and amount of restitution after full consideration of the convicted person\u2019s ability to pay the restitution.\u201d Section 45-6-101(2), MCA. The statute further provides: \u201cAmounts involved in criminal mischiefs committed pursuant to a common scheme or the same transaction ... may be aggregated in determining pecuniary loss.\u201d Section 45-6-101(4), MCA. Nevertheless, there can be no dispute, based on the aforementioned provisions of the Youth Court Act, that K.E.G. has not been \u201cconvicted\u201d of criminal mischief. Section 41-5-106, MCA. Therefore, \u00a7 45-6-101, MCA, by its terms, is inapplicable. The State\u2019s incorporation of a particular criminal statute into a petition alleging that a youth is delinquent is for the purpose of bringing the youth to court and providing the youth with notice of the allegations which, \u201cif [the youth were] an adult, would constitute a criminal offense.\u201d Section 41-5-103(ll)(a), MCA. Incorporation of the criminal statute into a youth court petition for purposes of charging does not thereby remove the proceedings from the operation of the Youth Court Act and subject the youth to sentencing as if the youth were a convicted adult offender.</p>\n<p id=\"AmV\">\u00b641 The dispositions that the youth court may impose on a delinquent youth are set forth in \u00a7 41-5-1513, MCA. A couple of these dispositions involve the application of Title 46. <em>See </em>\u00a7\u00a7 41-5-1512(l)(k), -1513(l)(a), MCA (authorizing the youth court to place a delinquent youth under home arrest as provided in Title 46, chapter 18, part 10, MCA); \u00a7 41-5-1513(l)(c), (l)(d), (2), MCA (authorizing the youth court to require a delinquent youth adjudicated for a violent or sexual offense to register as a violent or sexual offender pursuant to Title 46, chapter 23, part 5, MCA). However, aside from these two specific grants of authority to apply particular provisions of Title 46, there is no general <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>grant of authority to the youth court to apply the sentencing provisions of Titles 45 and 46 to a youth adjudicated as delinquent. Rather, the Legislature intended such youths to be subject to the dispositions enumerated in the Youth Court Act itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-4\">\u00b642 For all of these reasons, I disagree with the Court\u2019s contention that it is not applying adult sentencing provisions to K.E.G., and I respectfully dissent from the Court\u2019s decision to apply those provisions to the disposition of a youth adjudicated as delinquent under the Youth Court Act. I instead would apply the provisions set forth in the Youth Court Act itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-5\">III. The Court\u2019s Failure to Apply the Causal Requirement</p>\n<p id=\"b414-6\">\u00b643 This brings me to the issue argued by K.E.G. on this appeal: that there is no causal connection between his unlawful conduct and his restitution obligation for the aggregate damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-7\">\u00b644 Within the context of criminal offenses, we have consistently stated that <em>\u201ca </em>causal relation between the offender\u2019s criminal conduct and the pecuniary loss is the touchstone for determining whether a person or entity is a victim entitled to restitution. We will not hold an offender accountable for restitution for offenses he or she did not commit.\u201d <em>City of Billings v. Edward, </em>2012 MT 186, \u00b6 26, 366 Mont. 107, 285 P.3d 523 (citations and internal quotation marks omitted); <em>accord State v. Brownback, </em>2010 MT 96, \u00b6 20, 356 Mont. 190, 232 P.3d 385; <em>State v. Breeding, </em>2008 MT 162, \u00b6 13, 343 Mont. 323, 184 P.3d 313; <em>State v. Beavers, </em>2000 MT 145, \u00b6\u00b6 9-11, 300 Mont. 49, 3 P.3d 614. As the statutes referenced in these cases require restitution for damages that \u201carise out of\u2019 or are \u201ca result of\u2019 the offender\u2019s unlawful conduct <em>(see </em>\u00a7\u00a7 46-18-201(5), -241(1), -243(1), -243(2)(a), MCA), we have held that an offender may not be ordered to pay restitution in excess of the damages caused by that conduct. <em>Beavers, </em>\u00b6 12; <em>Breeding, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 13-19. We also have recognized that some pecuniary losses may be so attenuated as to no longer be considered \u201ca result of\u2019 the offense. <em>Brownback, </em>\u00b6 20 n. 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-8\">\u00b645 Given this precedent, the Court\u2019s reliance on the criminal mischief statute for the proposition that \u201c \u2018amounts involved in criminal mischiefs committed pursuant to a common scheme ... may be aggregated in determining pecuniary loss\u2019 \u201d is unpersuasive. Opinion, \u00b6 13 (quoting \u00a7 45-6-101(4), MCA). Assuming for the moment, and purely for the sake of argument, that this adult sentencing statute is applicable to a youth such as K.E.G., the question then becomes: What does \u201cpecuniary loss\u201d mean? That term is defined, for restitution purposes, as the full replacement cost of property taken, destroyed, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>harmed, or otherwise devalued \u201cas a result of\u2019 the offender\u2019s criminal conduct. Section 46-18-243(l)(b), MCA. Accordingly, while amounts involved in criminal mischiefs committed pursuant to a common scheme may be aggregated, the \u201cpecuniary loss\u201d forming the basis of any restitution award must have been \u201ca result of\u2019 the offender\u2019s criminal conduct. Section 45-6-101(4), MCA, does not vitiate this causal requirement. The Court\u2019s reasoning that \u201cvandalism sprees are not uncommonly the province of young, immature offenders,\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 15, does not excuse the Court\u2019s failure to limit KE.G.\u2019s restitution obligation-as he argues on appeal-to those damages that he actually caused.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-4\">\u00b646 Unlike the adult sentencing statutes cited above, the youth disposition statutes do not mandate restitution in all cases. Rather, a restitution obligation \u201cmay\u201d be imposed on a youth in an \u201cappropriate\u201d case. <em>See </em>\u00a7\u00a7 41-5-102(2)(c), -1304(l)(d), -1512(l)(d), -1513(l)(a), -1521(1), MCA. Even in the \u201cappropriate\u201d case, however, the youth statutes-like the adult statutes-mandate that restitution be \u201cfor damages that result from the offense for which the youth is disposed.\u201d Sections 41-5-1512(l)(d), -1513(l)(a), MCA. Like the adult statutes, the youth statutes define \u201cvictim\u201d as a person who has suffered property, physical, or emotional injury \u201cas a result of\u2019 the youth\u2019s unlawful conduct. Section 41-5-103(44)(a), MCA. This \u201cresult from\u201d and \u201cas a result of\u2019 language creates the same causal requirement that we held exists in the adult statutes. <em>See Edward, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 25-26; <em>Brownback, </em>\u00b6 20; <em>Breeding, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 12-13; <em>Beavers, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 8, 12. Hence, it follows that a youth may not be ordered to pay restitution in excess of the damages caused by the youth\u2019s unlawful activities. I note, further, that in the context of a youth court proceeding, it is particularly important that the youth understand he or she is being held responsible only for the damage resulting from the delinquent act. As set forth in the Youth Court Act, its purpose is to provide \u201cjudicial procedures in which the parties are ensured a fair, accurate hearing ....\u201d Section 41-5-102(4), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-5\">\u00b647 The dispositive question in this appeal, then, is what damages occurred \u201cas a result of\u2019 KE.G.\u2019s unlawful conduct. In the Petition filed with the Youth Court, the County Attorney alleged that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b415-6\">from about December 22, 2011, to January 1, 2012, the Youth, [K.E.G.], knowingly or purposely injured, damaged, or destroyed property of another or public property without consent, and did so in a series of acts motivated by a purpose or plan which resulted in the repeated commission of the same offense or that affected the same person or persons or their property ... [in] violation of</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b416-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>Sections 45-6-101 and 45-2-101(8), Montana Code Annotated. Four youths were identified in the Petition as participating with K.E.G. to damage vehicles. But the State did not allege a conspiracy among the youths, \u00a7 45-4-102, MCA, or allege that K.E.G. was legally accountable for the other youths\u2019 conduct, \u00a7 45-2-301, MCA. Either allegation might arguably have expanded KE.G.\u2019s culpability beyond the two-day timeframe for which he admitted delinquent conduct, if he had tendered an admission to conspiracy or accountability. K.E.G. was alleged, however, to have embarked on a common scheme to injure, damage, or destroy property from \u201cabout\u201d December 22 to January 1. His admissions to only two nights of delinquent conduct still constituted a common scheme.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-4\">\u00b648 At his initial appearance, K.E.G. denied the County Attorney\u2019s allegations in the Petition. At a subsequent hearing, however, K.E.G. admitted that he did engage in criminal mischief (common scheme) within the alleged timeframe, though not over the entire timeframe. The Court\u2019s assertion that K.E.G. \u201cacknowledged that he acted as part of a common criminal plan that resulted in 200 reports of vandalism against homes and vehicles in Billings between December 22, 2011, and January 1, 2012,\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 14, is factually incorrect. K.E.G. never admitted to acting as part of such a \u201cplan\u201d-which is essentially a mischaracterization of the charge here as one of \u201cconspiracy.\u201d While admitting that he had damaged or destroyed property on December 26 and 27, K.E.G. continued to deny engaging in such activity on any other night between December 22 and January 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-5\">\u00b649 This is reflected in the following colloquy among K.E.G., his counsel (Mr. Duke), and the Youth Court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-6\">MR. DUKE: He is going to admit to the petition that he was involved with two days on the criminal mischief....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-7\">THE COURT: All right. So-well, [K.E.G.], based on what your counsel has related to me, I need to make sure that you understand what your rights are. [The court proceeded to advise K.E.G. of his rights.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-8\">THE COURT: Okay. If you make admissions today, there isn\u2019t going to be a trial, and you are, in essence, waiving your right to a trial. You understand that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-9\">THE YOUTH: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-10\">THE COURT: And the State isn\u2019t going to have to prove anything. You understand that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-11\">THE YOUTH: (Nods.) For the-for the two other days that I <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>wasn\u2019t involved or what?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-4\">THE COURT: For-well, for what you were admitting to. Okay?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-5\">MR. DUKE: Right, if you admit, they don\u2019t have to prove those two days.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-6\">THE YOUTH: Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-7\">MR. DUKE: Do you understand that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-8\">THE YOUTH: Yes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b417-9\">\u00b650 KE.G.\u2019s admission to only two days is also reflected in the factual basis he provided for the admission:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-10\">THE COURT: Okay. In the petition, you are alleged to be a delinquent youth by virtue of committing the offense of criminal mischief, common scheme, a felony, alleged to have occurred on or about December 22nd, 2011, to January 1st, 2012. With regard to that offense, how do you plead?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-11\">THE YOUTH: Guilty.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-12\">THE COURT: Do you admit or deny it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-13\">THE YOUTH: I admit.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-14\">THE COURT: Okay. And, Mr. Duke, are you going to-would you like to assist your client in having him tell me what it is he did?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-15\">MR. DUKE: Yes, just a few questions, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ANC\">EXAMINATION</p>\n<p id=\"b417-16\">BY MR. DUKE:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-17\">Q. [K.E.G.], on December 26th and December 27th, were you here in Billings, Yellowstone County?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-18\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-19\">Q. And you were riding around in a vehicle with other youths, whose initials are J.E., L.P., K.G.?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-20\">A. Mm-hmm.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-21\">Q. And perhaps T.B.?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-22\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-23\">Q. And on those two nights you participated by breaking various windows from vehicles?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-24\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-25\">Q. And what did you use to break the windows?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-26\">A. A bat and a couple of them with a co2 bb gun.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-27\">Q. And you believe that the amount of loss on those two days exceeds $1,500?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-28\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-29\">Q. And if you would estimate, how many vehicles that were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>damaged during those two?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-4\">A. Myself or altogether?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-5\">Q. Well, with the group that was-you are with that night? Of those two days, excuse me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-6\">A. Both nights put together, I would say around 30 cars, 30 windows.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-7\">MR. DUKE: I have no further questions, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-8\">THE COURT: Well, [K.E.G.], based on that description, it does appear to me that you in fact did commit these-this offense and I\u2019m going to accept your admission.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b418-9\">\u00b651 In imposing the aggregate restitution amount, the Youth Court stated that \u201cwhile you may not have been present at every act of criminal mischief, you have admitted to being responsible as part and parcel of a common scheme, and the common scheme asserted in the petition was the entire common scheme, and all of the days of this criminal mischief that went on with the various participants.\u201d K.E.G. pointed out that he had not admitted to \u201cthe entire common scheme\u201d alleged in the Petition. In response, the court stated: \u201cI am not functioning under the belief that [K.E.G.] was present at every act of criminal mischief alleged in the restitution matters. I believe that he was there two days, as he has said. I do believe that he, however, did admit to that common scheme.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b418-10\">\u00b652 Based upon this record, I believe the Youth Court\u2019s and this Court\u2019s determination that K.E.G. admitted to (as the Court puts it) \u201ca common criminal plan that resulted in 200 reports of vandalism against homes and vehicles in Billings between December 22, 2011, and January 1, 2012,\u201d is not correct. While the State alleged that KE.G.\u2019s common scheme occurred \u201cfrom about December 22, 2011, to January 1, 2012,\u201d the transcript of the proceeding clearly establishes that K.E.G. never admitted to a common scheme spanning those dates. K.E.G. and his counsel were very clear-both before making his admission and during the recitation of the factual basis for the admission-that his offense took place on December 26 and 27, and only those two nights. K.E.G. maintained his denial as to the other eight nights and brought alibi witnesses to the disposition hearing to establish that he was not present on those other nights.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-11\">\u00b653 Significantly, the State chose to accept K.E.G.\u2019s admission to only a portion of the delinquent acts alleged in the Petition. The State chose not to proceed with an adjudicatory hearing in which the State might prove KE.G.\u2019s involvement in more than just two nights. Despite this decision, however, the State has sought to hold K.E.G. accountable for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>conduct that K.E.G. denied and that the State chose not to prove. Neither the State nor the Youth Court nor this Court has identified any legal authority supporting this acceptance of an admission where a factual basis for the other eight nights has not been established and, in fact, has been specifically denied by K.E.G. It has never been established factually that K.E.G.\u2019s common scheme extended to any other night(s) between December 22 and January 1, or that the damages which occurred on the other nights \u201cresulted from\u201d KE.G.\u2019s unlawful conduct on December 26 and 27.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-4\">\u00b654 In its Sentencing Memorandum Regarding Restitution (filed in the Youth Court on April 23, 2012), the State argued that K.E.G. had \u201cencourag[ed]\u201d the other youths to commit the vandalism on all ten nights and that K.E.G. thus bore responsibility for the other youths\u2019 actions on nights when K.E.G. was not present-i.e., as the State put it, \u201cIn for a penny, in for a pound.\u201d The fact remains, however, that the State did not charge K.E.G. under an accountability theory. <em>See </em>\u00a7\u00a7 45-2-301, -302, MCA. K.E.G. was charged with criminal mischief over a ten-night period, he admitted to a two-night common scheme, and the State chose not to prove the other eight nights. The State cannot now avoid the consequences of this choice by rewriting the charge to be one of conspiracy or accountability for criminal mischief. \u00b655 I believe the Court errs in affirming the Youth Court\u2019s imposition of a restitution obligation for the aggregate damages that occurred over the entire ten-day period. I would reverse the Youth Court\u2019s order and remand with instructions to impose restitution in the amount of $16,020.63. This is the total pecuniary loss on December 26 and 27. As noted, K.E.G. conceded that he is jointly and severally liable for this amount, and he did not challenge his ability to pay it.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">\u00b656 In conclusion, based on the foregoing, I concur in the Court\u2019s decision to reverse, but I dissent from the Court\u2019s analysis in reaching that decision and from the Court\u2019s instruction to the Youth Court to consider on remand K.E.G.\u2019s ability to pay the full $78,702.09.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b405-7\">I refer to the total amount of damages caused by all the youths over the ten-day period from December 22, 2011, to January 1, 2012, as the \u201caggregate\u201d amount of restitution.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b407-8\"> K.E.G. does discuss \u201cability to pay\u201d is in his reply brief on appeal, which is the source of the language quoted by the Court at \u00b6 11 of the Opinion. But there are three things that should be noted about KE.G.\u2019s discussion. First, because he addresses this matter for the first time in his reply brief, the State has not had the opportunity to respond. Second, we have held many times that we will not address the merits of an issue presented for the first time in a reply brief. <em>State v. Makarchuk, </em>2009 MT 82, \u00b6 19, 349 Mont. 507, 204 P.3d 1213; <em>Pengra v. State, </em>2000 MT 291, \u00b6 13, 302 Mont. 276, 14 P.3d 499. Third, the ability-to-pay requirement that K.E.G. discusses in his reply brief is contained in \u00a7 45-6-101(2), MCA. Yet, prior to discussing this requirement, K.E.G. argues that the sentencing-related subsections of \u00a7 45-6-101, MCA, do not apply to him. He merely concludes this argument with the observation that if \u00a7 45-6-101, MCA, is the basis for imposing a restitution obligation on him-a point K.E.G. does not concede-then the statute\u2019s ability-to-pay requirement ought to be imposed as well.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b411-9\"> \u201cCommon scheme\u201d is defined elsewhere in the Code as \u201ca series of acts or omissions motivated by a purpose to accomplish a single criminal objective or by a common purpose or plan that results in the repeated commission of the same offense or that affects the same person or the same persons or the property of the same person or persons.\u201d Section 45-2-101(8), MCA.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b412-7\"><em> </em>In addition to the foregoing statutes, the following statutory provisions reflect the unique treatment of youth versus adult offenders: \u00a7 41-5-206(6), MCA (allowing a youth to be sentenced under Titles 45 and 46 if the youth has been convicted in district court of one of the enumerated offenses, but otherwise requiring the youth to be sentenced under Title 41); \u00a7 41-5-208(2), (3), MCA (listing prerequisites for the transfer of certain youth cases to district court); \u00a7\u00a7 41-5-216, -1524(2), MCA (requiring youth court records to be \u201cphysically sealed\u201d on the youth\u2019s 18th birthday, with certain exceptions); \u00a7 41-5-321(2), MCA (clarifying that the taking of a youth into custody is not an \u201carrest\u201d); \u00a7\u00a7 41-5-334(1), -349(1), -1522(2), MCA (providing, with limited exceptions, that a youth may not be detained or placed in a facility used for the confinement of adults accused or convicted of criminal offenses); \u00a7\u00a7 41-5-1301, -1302, MCA (permitting youth matters to be resolved through informal dispositions and consent adjustments, in lieu of formal proceedings); \u00a7\u00a7 41-5-1401, -1402, MCA (specifying procedures for commencing a formal proceeding against a youth); \u00a7 41-5-1431(3), MCA (stating that the standard of proof in probation revocation of a youth is the same standard used in probation revocation of an adult, but that, \u201c[i]n all other respects,\u201d the proceedings \u201care governed by the procedures, rights, and duties applicable to proceedings on petitions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>alleging that the youth is delinquent or a youth in need of intervention\u201d); \u00a7 41-5-1501, MCA (permitting a consent decree in lieu of an adjudication); \u00a7 41-5-1502, MCA (specifying procedures at an adjudicatory hearing); \u00a7 41-5-1524(3), MCA (requiring youth records to be maintained in a separate management information system and not to be included in an adult offender management system, unless the youth has been adjudicated as an adult); \u00a7 41-5-1604(l)(a), MCA (distinguishing between \u201cjuvenile dispositions under 41-5-1512 or 41-5-1513\u201d and \u201cany sentence allowed by the statute that establishes the penalty for the offense ... and that would be permissible if the offender were an adult\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b419-6\"> According to the State\u2019s Sentencing Memorandum Regarding Restitution, the $78,702.09 figure includes amounts from outside the date range alleged in the Petition.
