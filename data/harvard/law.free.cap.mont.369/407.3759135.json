We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-7\">PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b430-8\">\u00b63 On July 14, 2012, P.A.C. appeared at the emergency room of St. Peter\u2019s Hospital in Helena, Montana, and was voluntarily admitted to the Behavioral Health Unit. P.A.C. engaged in disruptive and threatening behavior while at the Hospital. She was detained and transferred to the Montana State Hospital (MSH). On July 18, 2012, the State petitioned the District Court to commit P.A.C. to MSH for 90 days based upon the report of a professional person from the Behavioral Health Unit. On July 18 P.A.C. made her initial court appearance on the Petition from MSH via the VisionNet video conferencing system. The District Court appointed counsel to represent her, informed her of her rights pursuant to \u00a7 53-21-115, MCA, including the right to be present at the commitment hearing. P.A.C. raised her hand and asked if she could ask a question, and then asked for an explanation of a \u201c72-hour police hold.\u201d The Judge indicated that he would not answer questions, ordered an evaluation by a professional person and set the commitment hearing for the next day.</p>\n<p id=\"AaP\">\u00b64 P.A.C. was transported to the Lewis &amp; Clark County Courthouse in Helena for the evaluation and commitment hearing set for July 19, 2012. She would not cooperate with the court-ordered evaluation, asserting that there was nothing wrong with her and that she only needed alcohol and marijuana. Even though P.A.C. was present in the Lewis &amp; Clark County Courthouse for the examination, she did not appear at the commitment hearing held in the same building later the same day. At the start of the commitment hearing P.A.C.\u2019s attorney informed the District Court that she had met with P.A.C. and informed her \u201cof all her rights, including the right to be present, and she declined.\u201d Without further inquiry, the District Court proceeded with the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>\u00b65 The Psychiatric Nurse Practitioner who testified as the professional person at the hearing described P.A.C.\u2019s voluntary admission to the Behavioral Health Unit, and that she was grandiose, psychotic and agitated. P.A.C. refused to cooperate in the evaluation, rejected medication while asking for alcohol and marijuana, and was abusive and threatening to other patients and staff. She maintained that there was nothing wrong with her. While she had a history of bipolar disorder, her diagnosis was psychosis not otherwise specified, based upon her refusal to cooperate. The professional person opined that P.A.C. needed commitment and medication to stabilize her behavior and to lessen the chance that she would provoke a dangerous confrontation with others.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-4\">\u00b66 P.A.C. contends that the District Court erred and violated her right to due process by proceeding with the commitment hearing without first \u201cobtaining a valid waiver\u201d of her right to be present under \u00a7 53-21-119, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b431-6\">\u00b67 This Court undertakes plenary, sometimes called de novo, review of due process claims arising from involuntary civil commitments, to determine whether the district court\u2019s action was correct. <em>In the Matter of L.K., </em>2009 MT 366, \u00b6 11, 353 Mont. 246, 219 P.3d 1263.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b431-8\">\u00b68 A person who is the subject of a petition for involuntary commitment has express statutory rights, including the right to be present at any hearing. Sections 53-21-115 and -116, MCA. Any of these rights may be waived except for the right to counsel and the right to treatment. <em>In re the Mental Health of C.R.C., </em>2009 MT 125, \u00b6 21, 350 Mont. 211, 207 P.3d 289. Section 53-21-119, MCA, governs the waiver of rights in commitment proceedings, and describes the waiver of rights in several different situations. The first clause of \u00a7 53-21-119(1), MCA, provides: \u201cA person may waive the person\u2019s rights ....\u201d Therefore, a person who is the subject of the petition for involuntary commitment has the right to waive his or her own rights, which necessarily includes the right to attend any proceedings. The second clause of \u00a7 53-21-119(1), MCA, provides: \u201c... or if the person is <em>not capable </em>of making an intentional and knowing decision,\u201d (emphasis added) then the person\u2019s rights may be waived by the person\u2019s attorney <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>and friend<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u201cif a record is made of the reasons for the waiver.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b432-4\">\u00b69 Section 53-21-119(2), MCA, provides that the right of the person to be \u201cphysically present at a hearing\u201d may \u201calso\u201d be waived by agreement of the person\u2019s attorney and the person\u2019s friend, with the concurrence of a professional person and the judge. In that instance the judge must make a finding that the person would likely be seriously adversely affected by appearing at the hearing and a finding that holding the hearing in an alternative location would not prevent those adverse effects. This Court requires strict adherence to these statutory requirements because of the important constitutional rights they represent. <em>In the Matter of L.K-S., </em>2011 MT 21, \u00b6 15, 359 Mont. 191, 247 P.3d 1100; <em>In the Matter of R.F., </em>2013 MT 59, \u00b6 17, 369 Mont. 236, 296 P.3d 1189.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">\u00b610 P.A.C. does not contend that \u00a7 53-21-119(2), MCA, applies to her case and there is also nothing in the record to indicate that attending the hearing would have seriously adversely affected her mental condition. P.A.C. expressly concedes that there is nothing in the record to indicate that she was \u201cnot capable\u201d of waiving her right to be present at the commitment hearing so as to trigger the second clause of \u00a7 53-21-119(1), MCA (\u201cif the person is not capable of making an intentional and knowing decision....\u201d). Thus this case presents a situation covered by the first clause of \u00a7 53-21-119(1), MCA, which allows the person who is the subject of a petition for involuntary commitment to waive her rights, including the right to be present at the commitment hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-6\">\u00b611 In the recent case of <em>In the Matter of R.W.K., </em>2013 MT 54, 369 Mont. 193,297 P.3d 318, the respondent\u2019s attorney represented to the district court that her client, while actually present at the hearing, wished to \u201cwaive his rights\u201d and would stipulate to the allegations in the petition for involuntary commitment. The District Court found that R.W.K. \u201cunderstands all procedural rights and that he waives these rights knowingly.\u201d <em>Matter of R. </em>W.K., \u00b6 10. This Court found that there was \u201cno error in the District Court\u2019s reliance on R.W.K\u2019s counsel\u2019s representations\u201d concerning the intent to waive. <em>Matter of R.W.K, </em>\u00b6 24. It follows that when the person who is the subject of a petition for involuntary commitment is capable of making a waiver decision, then the person\u2019s attorney may convey to the court the person\u2019s desire to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>waive the right to be present at the commitment hearing. However, \u00a7 53-21-119(1), MCA, \u201cdoes not specify the type or level of inquiry necessary to constitute an intentional and knowing waiver.\u201d <em>Matter of R.W.K, </em>\u00b6 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-4\">\u00b612 While P.A.C.\u2019s attorney could inform the District Court of P.A.C.\u2019s desire to waive her right to be present, we conclude that the District Court should have made further inquiry to determine whether P.A.C. was capable of making an intentional and knowing decision. In <em>In the Matter of R.W.K, </em>his attorney stated to the district court, in R.W.K.\u2019s presence, that she believed that R.W.K. understood his rights and the nature of the proceeding, even though suffering from a mental disorder. The attorney explained that she had discussed this twice with R.W.K. and he wished to waive his rights and to stipulate to the petition for commitment. <em>Matter of R.W.K., </em>\u00b6 9. The district court found, based upon the attorney\u2019s \u201crepresentations and the files and records,\u201d that R.W.K. \u201cintelligently waived his rights.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">\u00b613 While P.A.C.\u2019s attorney properly informed the District Court that her client wished to waive her right to be present at the commitment hearing, there is nothing in the record to provide confirmation that P.A.C. was capable of making a knowing and intelligent waiver, despite the State\u2019s contention that she should be involuntarily committed. While \u00a7 53-21-119(1), MCA, \u201cdoes not specify the type or level of inquiry necessary to constitute an intentional and knowing waiver,\u201d <em>Matter of R.W.K, </em>\u00b6 21, we determine that the District Court and the parties must make some record that the person who is the subject of the petition for involuntary commitment is capable of making a knowing and intelligent waiver of rights. Both sides in the case, as well as the district court, have an obligation to insure that the record contains some support that the waiver was intentional and knowing. Doing so protects not only the rights of the person who is the subject of the petition, but also protects the integrity of the proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"AP0\">\u00b614 The nature and extent of the record will depend upon the facts and circumstances of each case. The record does not necessarily have to reflect anything more than what was done in <em>Matter of R. </em>W.K.-counsel\u2019s representation that she had discussed the matter with her client; that the client desired to waive his rights; and that the attorney was satisfied that her client understood his rights and the nature of the proceeding. In some cases the capacity of the person to waive her rights may be in doubt and a more diligent inquiry will be appropriate, perhaps involving input from the professional person who evaluated the respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-6\">\u00b615  Nor is it necessary that the respondent be required to attend <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>the proceeding against her will. Obviously there is no reason to require a respondent like P.A.C. to attend the hearing before her attorney can inform the court that she waives her right to be present. Such a requirement would elevate form over substance and would be a disservice to the respondent who does not wish to attend.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-4\">\u00b616  However, it is necessary, as in <em>Matter of R.W.K., </em>that the district court satisfy itself that the waiver is intentional and knowing, and that the record reflect the district court\u2019s acceptance of the sufficiency of counsel\u2019s representations as to the waiver, or of any other evidence presented on the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">\u00b617 For the reasons stated above, the final order of the District Court committing P.A.C. to the Montana State Hospital is reversed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b434-6\">JUSTICES McKINNON, COTTER, WHEAT and MORRIS concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b432-7\"> The district court judge may appoint a friend for the person who is the subject of a petition for involuntary commitment, \u00a7 53-21-122(2)(b), MCA, but is not mandated to do so, <em>In the Matter of C.R., </em>2012 MT 258, \u00b6 22, 367 Mont. 1, 289 P.3d 125.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
