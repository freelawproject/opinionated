The pickup truck was owned by Michael Morris, Sr. (Morris, Sr.), a Teton County resident. The collision occurred in Teton County but Yeager\u2019s vehicle was then propelled across the county line and came to rest in Cascade County. Yeager filed a complaint in Cascade County against both men claiming Morris, Jr. was negligent in his operation of the vehicle and that Morris, Sr. negligently entrusted his son with the pickup truck. Morris, Jr., acting as a self-represented litigant, moved to change the venue to Glacier or Teton counties asserting Cascade County was not a proper venue. The Eighth Judicial District Court agreed and granted the motion, moving the proceeding to Glacier County. Yeager appeals. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-10\">ISSUE</p>\n<p id=\"b113-11\">\u00b62 Did the District Court err in determining Cascade County was an improper place for trial?</p>\n<p id=\"b113-12\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b113-13\">\u00b63 On March 19, 2011, Yeager and her daughter were traveling just inside the Teton County line when their vehicle was struck by a pickup truck driven by Morris, Jr., who had failed to stop at a stop sign. It is undisputed that the collision occurred in Teton County, and that Yeager\u2019s car came to rest in Cascade County. Yeager and her young daughter were injured in the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>\u00b64 On August 3,2011, Yeager filed a complaint in the Eighth Judicial District Court in Cascade County asserting that Morris, Jr.\u2019s negligent driving caused the accident. She also asserted that based upon Morris, Jr.\u2019s \u201cpoor driving record,\u201d Morris, Sr. negligently entrusted his son with the truck. Yeager demanded a jury trial and sought damages for medical expenses, past and future emotional distress, and for mental and physical pain, among other claims of injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-4\">\u00b65 On October 24, 2011, Morris, Jr., acting without counsel, filed an Answer, a Motion to Dismiss with a brief in support, and a Motion to Change Venue with a brief in support. The court clerk date-stamped and filed each document. The time of entry for all five documents was 12:40 p.m. Morris, Jr. later asserted that he presented his pleadings to the court clerk in a specific order with the Motion to Change Venue first, followed by the brief in support, the Motion to Dismiss, its brief in support, and the Answer. The Motion to Change Venue asked that the matter be transferred to either Teton County where defendant Morris, Sr. resided and where the accident occurred, or to Glacier County where defendant Morris, Jr. resided. Morris, Jr. argued that Cascade County was not a proper venue for the proceeding, and that the District Court must therefore grant his motion to change the place of trial to a designated county, as required under \u00a7 25-2-201, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-5\">\u00b66 Yeager opposed the motions to change venue and to dismiss.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> She first argued that Morris, Jr. waived his right to have venue changed because he did not file his Motion to Change Venue <em>before </em>he filed his Answer as required by applicable statutes. Moreover, she claimed that Morris, Jr.\u2019s Answer did not raise venue as a defense. Yeager further argued that the injuries resulting from Morris, Jr.\u2019s tortious negligence occurred in Cascade County, making Cascade County a proper venue for her action.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-6\">\u00b67 On February 16, 2012, the District Court granted Morris, Jr.\u2019s motion to change venue and transferred the matter to Glacier County. As an initial matter, the court refused to deny Morris, Jr.\u2019s motion to change venue based upon waiver, noting the circumstances under which Morris, Jr. presented multiple simultaneous pleadings to the court clerk. The District Court explained that the \u201corder in which [the documents] were docketed by the Clerk of Court is purely a matter of chance which is dictated by the Clerk of Court and not the parties.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>The District Court then expressly determined that Cascade County was not a proper venue for this action because the tort of negligent driving was \u201ccommitted\u201d in Teton County and the defendants lived in Teton and Glacier counties. Lastly, the court declined to rule on Morris, Jr.\u2019s motion to dismiss, determining it was proper to allow the District Court in Glacier County to render that ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-4\">\u00b68 Yeager appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b115-6\">\u00b69  The determination of whether a county represents the proper place for trial presents a question of law that involves the application of the venue statutes to pleaded facts. Our review of a district court\u2019s grant or denial of a motion to change venue is plenary, and we determine whether the district court\u2019s ruling was legally correct. <em>Deichl v. Savage, </em>2009 MT 293, \u00b6 6, 352 Mont. 282, 216 P.3d 749.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b115-9\">\u00b610 <em>Did the District Court err in determining Cascade County was an improper place for trial ?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b115-10\">\u00b611  This is a tort action. Section 25-2-122(1), MCA, sets forth the criteria for determining the proper place of trial for a tort action: (a) the county in which the defendants or any of them reside at the commencement of the action; or (b) the county in which the tort was committed. It is undisputed that neither of the defendants resided in Cascade County at the commencement of the action. Therefore, for Cascade County to be considered a proper place for trial, then the tort must have been committed in Cascade County. Yeager argues that since she sustained her injuries in Cascade County, the tort was arguably completed there, thus making Cascade County a proper venue for trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-11\">\u00b612 Yeager urges us to apply the venue rationale set forth in <em>Circle S Seeds of Mont., Inc. v. Mont. Merch., Inc., </em>2006 MT 311, 335 Mont. 16, 157 P.3d 671. In <em>Circle S, </em>Circle S sued Montana Merchandising, Inc. (MMI) in Gallatin County for trademark infringement. A dispute on venue arose with Circle S, a Gallatin County company, arguing Gallatin County was the proper venue and MMI, the defendant whose corporate offices were located in Cascade County, asserting that the decisions leading to Circle S\u2019s claim of trademark infringement took place in MMI\u2019s Cascade County offices. The District Court ruled that Gallatin County was the proper venue for the action and MMI appealed. We affirmed the District Court by ruling that a \u201ctort is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>committed ... where there is a concurrence of breach of obligation and the occasion of damages.\u201d <em>Circle S, </em>\u00b6 18. We held that Circle S experienced its damages in Gallatin County. <em>Circle S, \u00b6\u00b6 </em>19, 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-4\">\u00b613 Morris, Jr. argues on appeal that his \u201cbreach of obligation\u201d or \u201ccause of negligence\u201d occurred in Teton County when the two vehicles collided. Morris, Jr. relies on <em>Howard v. </em>Dooner, 211 Mont. 312, 688 P.2d 279 (1984), <em>and Deichl. </em>He maintains that since the tort occurred in Teton County and the defendants resided in Glacier and Teton Counties, only those two venues are proper, and that the District Court was therefore correct in granting his motion to change venue.</p>\n<p id=\"AvQ\">\u00b614 In <em>Howard, </em>a Fergus County resident travelled to Yellowstone County to see an allergy doctor, who prescribed a particular medication. When the patient arrived home, she ingested the medication and suffered adverse reactions and injury. She sued the prescribing physician and the manufacturer of the medication, Dooner Labs, in the Tenth Judicial District Court of Fergus County. The defendant doctor moved to have venue changed to Yellowstone County. Howard, 211 Mont. at 313, 688 P.2d at 279. The doctor claimed that if he committed malpractice, he did so in Yellowstone County. Howard countered that the tort was not complete until she suffered injury which occurred in Fergus County. We noted that when a breach and the damages resulting from the breach occur in different counties, a \u201cfundamental requirement\u201d in determining venue is \u201cfairness to the defendant.\u201d <em>Howard, </em>211 Mont. at 315-16, 688 P.2d at 280.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-6\">\u00b615 Focusing on the location where the doctor \u201ccommitted\u201d the breach, we stated,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b116-7\">[W]e recognize but do not adopt the minority view-i.e., that a tort is \u201cportable\u201d and arises wherever the damages arise. States such as Florida which have adopted this approach have venue statutes that provide that an action may be brought wherever the tort \u201caccrued,\u201d not where it was \u201ccommitted.\u201d We may have reached a different conclusion had our venue statute provided that an action may be brought where the tort \u201caccrued,\u201d as opposed to where it was \u201ccommitted.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b116-8\"><em>Dooner, </em>211 Mont. at 318, 688 P.2d at 282 (internal citation omitted). As a result, we reversed the district court in <em>Howard </em>and directed venue of the proceeding changed to Yellowstone County.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-9\">\u00b616 Subsequently, in <em>Deichl, </em>Deichl, a Butte-Silver Bow County resident, purchased ahorse from Yellowstone County residents Savage and Torgerson upon the sellers\u2019 representation that the gelding was gentle and would be a suitable horse for a young and inexperienced <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>rider. Several months later, Deichl, while riding the horse in Butte-Silver Bow County, was thrown from the horse and sustained a head injury. He filed suit in the Second Judicial District Court for Butte-Silver Bow County. Savage and Torgerson moved to change venue to Yellowstone County, arguing that if they negligently misrepresented the fitness of the animal, the tort was committed in their county of residence, Yellowstone County. The district court denied their motion and they appealed. <em>Deichl, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 4-5. We reversed, analyzing several cases including <em>Howard, Circle S, </em>and <em>Gabriel v. School Dist. No. 4, </em>264 Mont. 177, 870 P.2d 1351 (1994). We observed that unlike the wrongful death claim in <em>Gabriel, </em>\u201cthe tort of negligent misrepresentation does not contain an inherent \u2018accrual\u2019 element, but rather is committed in the location where the misrepresentation takes place.\u201d <em>Deichl, </em>\u00b6 20. Moreover, we stated that \u201cunlike the alleged actions covering multiple counties by the defendant in <em>Circle S Seeds, </em>Savage and Torgerson took no actions and committed no breach in [Butte-Silver Bow] county.\u201d Accordingly, we held that Savage and Torgerson \u201ccommitted\u201d the tort of negligent misrepresentation for venue purposes in Yellowstone County. <em>Deichl, </em>\u00b6 20. Similarly, here, the defendants committed no tort in Cascade County; the tort was committed in Teton County.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-4\">\u00b617 As we noted at \u00b6 18 in <em>Deichl, Circle S </em>presented a unique situation. In <em>Circle S, </em>the tort of trademark infringement took place in multiple counties, while here, the tort was indisputably committed in one county only-Teton County. We cannot ignore the language of \u00a7 25-2-122(1), MCA, which provides that the proper place for trial is the county in which the tort was committed. <em>Circle S </em>is inapposite here, and as we did in <em>Deichl, </em>we decline to apply the specific holding of that case to the simple, straightforward tort case before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-5\">\u00b618 If an action is brought in a county that is not a proper place for trial, then the court must, on motion, change the place of trial. Section 25-2-201(1), MCA. Given the clear requisites of \u00a7 25-2-122(1), MCA, Cascade County was not a proper place for trial. Therefore, the District Court did not err in granting the motion for change of venue filed by Morris, Jr.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-6\">\u00b619 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b117-7\">JUSTICES BAKER and RICE and DISTRICT JUDGE BAUGH, sitting for JUSTICE McKINNON, concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b114-7\"> We do not address Morris, Jr.\u2019s Motion to Dismiss in this Opinion because after granting his motion to change venue, the District Court did not address the Motion to Dismiss nor did Yeager raise the court\u2019s failure to address the motion on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b117-8\">JUSTICE MORRIS</author>\n<p id=\"AUc\">dissents.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-9\">\u00b620 We previously rejected the argument that, for the purposes of determining venue, a \u201ctort occurs\u201d only where the breach of duty <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>occurs. <em>Circle S Seeds, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 8, 18. We recognized instead that a tort occurs \u201c \u2018where there is a concurrence of breach of obligation and the occasion of damages.\u2019 \u201d <em>Circle S Seeds, </em>\u00b6 18, <em>quoting BHC Holding Co. v. Hurly, </em>242 Mont. 4, 6, 788 P.2d 322, 323 (1990). We determined that venue would be proper either in the county where the breach of duty occurred or the county where the damage occurred. <em>Circle S Seeds, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 18, 19, <em>citing Hurly, </em>242 Mont. at 6, 788 P.2d at 323-24 (analyzing both where breach occurred and where damages occurred).</p>\n<p id=\"b118-4\">\u00b621 We reversed course in <em>Deichl </em>where this Court held that the county where the breach of the duty occurred constituted the only proper venue. <em>Deichl, </em>\u00b6 22. Deichl actually suffered damages in Silver Bow County, while the alleged breach of duty in a negligent misrepresentation claim had taken place in Yellowstone County. The Court nonetheless determined that the county in which Diechl actually had suffered damages constituted an improper venue. <em>Deichl, </em>\u00b6 19. The Court focused on the fact that the tort of negligent misrepresentation does not contain an inherent \u201caccrual\u201d element. <em>Deichl, </em>\u00b6 20. The Court rejected Silver Bow County as a proper venue in light of the fact that the defendants had taken \u201cno actions and committed no breach in that county.\u201d <em>Deichl, </em>\u00b6 20.1 dissented in <em>Deichl </em>on the basis that the elements of the tort were not complete, and Deichl had no cause of action, until he actually suffered damages in Silver Bow County. <em>Deichl, </em>\u00b6 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-5\">\u00b622 The Court again has determined that the breach of duty represents the only relevant element of a tort for the determination of venue. Morris breached his duty of care in Teton County. The vehicles collided in Teton County. The collision propelled Yeager\u2019s vehicle across the county line into Cascade County. Thus, unlike the defendants in <em>Deichl, </em>at least a portion of Morris\u2019s actions took place in Cascade County. Yeager further alleged in her complaint that she suffered damages in Cascade County. Pursuant to <em>Circle S Seeds </em>and <em>Hurly, </em>where we considered both where the breach occurred and where the damage occurred, either Cascade County or Teton County would qualify as a proper venue.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-6\">\u00b623 The Supreme Court of Indiana considered nearly identical facts to the unusual case before this Court. <em>Randolph County v. Chamness, </em>879 N.E.2d 555 (Indiana 2008). A motor vehicle accident began in one county and the vehicle came to rest in a different county. The court held that either county represented a proper venue when a motor vehicle accident begins in one county and the vehicle comes to rest in the other county. <em>Chamness, </em>879 N.E.2d at 558. No benefit would be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>gained by declaring only one county to be the proper venue. Witnesses and police reports were just as likely to be found in either or both of the counties. <em>Chamness, </em>879 N.E.2d at 558.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-4\">\u00b624 The Court arbitrarily has decided that the breach of duty qualifies as the only element of a tort relevant for a determination of venue. Section 25-2-115, MCA, recognizes that more than one county may qualify as an appropriate venue. When different elements of a tort occur in different counties we should consider all of these counties as a proper venue. We gain no benefit by declaring Cascade County an improper venue. We should consider equally all of the elements of a tort necessary for a cause of action to accrue. <em>Circle S Seeds, </em>\u00b6 18. I agree that \u201c[mjost people would say that this accident occurred in both counties, and if we were to hold that an \u2018accident or collision\u2019 must occur only in one county, we would not add any level of convenience, only a level of disputatiousness.\u201d <em>Chamness, </em>879 N.E.2d at 558.
