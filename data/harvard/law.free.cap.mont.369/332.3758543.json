He challenges the District Court\u2019s rulings, which denied his challenge of a prospective juror for cause, excluded his expert witness from testifying about complex partial seizures, denied his request for a lesser-included offense jury instruction, and ordered him to pay $600 in restitution to the State and an undetermined amount of restitution to the victims and their family members for mental health treatment. We affirm in part and reverse in part, and address the following issues:</p>\n<p id=\"A46\">\u00b62 <em>Did the District Court err by denying Jay\u2019s challenge for cause?</em></p>\n<p id=\"Aga\">\u00b63 <em>Did the District Court err by excluding Jay\u2019s expert witness on complex partial seizures ?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b355-9\">\u00b64 <em>Did the District Court err by denying Jay\u2019s request to instruct the jury on DUI as a lesser-included offense of Vehicular Homicide While Under the Influence?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b355-10\">\u00b65 <em>Did the District Court err by ordering Jay to pay restitution to the State and the victims and their family members ?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b355-11\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b355-12\">\u00b66 At around 8 p.m. on October 3,2008, Jay was traveling westbound on Interstate 90 (1-90) between Laurel and Billings. Commuters on I-90 watched as Jay\u2019s pickup suddenly made a sharp turn into the grass median that separated the eastbound and westbound traffic. His pickup continued through the median before turning onto 1-90 and driving into the oncoming eastbound traffic. Jay traveled the wrong way on 1-90 for approximately one-fifth of a mile. Two cars successfully avoided colliding with Jay\u2019s pickup by driving off the road. However, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>Jay\u2019s pickup struck a third car, carrying David Hanson (Hanson) and Janice Thomas (Thomas) at a high rate of speed. Hanson and Thomas suffered traumatic injuries that resulted in their deaths at the scene of the crash.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-4\">\u00b67 Emergency medical technicians (EMTs) assisting Hanson, Thomas, and Jay at the scene smelled the odor of alcoholic beverage on Jay\u2019s breath. When asked, Jay volunteered that he had drunk two beers and that this would teach him a lesson in \u201cdriving tired.\u201d Jay suffered a small laceration above his left eye and an open fracture on his left leg. EMTs transported Jay to St. Vincent\u2019s Hospital in Billings for treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">\u00b68 Troopers Kyle Hayter (Trooper Hayter) and Shane Warehime (Trooper Warehime) of the Montana Highway Patrol investigated the crash. Trooper Hayter arrived on scene at 8:22 p.m. He determined that Jay had traveled one-fifth of a mile the wrong way on 1-90 before colliding with Hanson and Thomas. Nonhuman factors did not explain the crash: the weather was fine, there was no debris on the roadway, and the deliberate nature of the trajectory of Jay\u2019s truck was not consistent with mechanical problems. Data recovered from the power control module<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> of Jay\u2019s pickup revealed that Jay had not applied the brakes during the 25 seconds preceding the crash. Trooper Warehime photographed the crash scene, spoke with witnesses, and went to St. Vincent\u2019s Hospital to talk to Jay. Jay told Trooper Warehime he had drank two beers and had fallen asleep behind the wheel.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-6\">\u00b69 Dr. Rentz, a surgeon, treated Jay at St. Vincent\u2019s Hospital. Jay was coherent. He understood that he was in the emergency room, and why he was there. While Jay appeared alert, Dr. Rentz smelled alcohol on Jay and noted that he was behaving like he had been drinking. A neurosurgeon performed a head CT scan, which came back non-remarkable; the neurosurgeon did not recommend any follow up treatment for a brain injury or disorder. Jay told Dr. Rentz that he did not have a history of seizures. At 9:20 p.m., St. Vincent\u2019s Hospital staff drew a plasma blood sample from Jay as part of his medical treatment. Subsequent testing registered Jay\u2019s blood alcohol content (BAC) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>between 0.0706 and 0.088.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b357-4\">\u00b610 The State charged Jay with two counts of Vehicular Homicide While Under the Influence for the deaths of Hanson and Thomas. In the alternative, the State charged Jay with two counts of Negligent Homicide for Hanson\u2019s and Thomas\u2019s deaths. The State also charged Jay with two counts of Criminal Endangerment for forcing other drivers off the road to avoid colliding with Jay.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">\u00b611 Jay pleaded not guilty to the charges and sought to prove at trial that his driving was the result of losing consciousness before the crash, perhaps because of a seizure. Prior to trial, Jay disclosed he intended to call Dr. Dale Peterson, a specialist in neurology, to testify as an expert on seizure disorders and their symptoms, effects, and diagnosis. The State moved to exclude Dr. Peterson after its interview with him revealed that he had never examined Jay; his only basis of knowledge about Jay\u2019s medical status and about what happened on October 3, 2008, consisted of a 30-minute electroencephalogram (EEG)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> that was \u201cunremarkable,\u201d in that it did not show Jay was suffering from seizures, and an oral account of events provided by Jay\u2019s lawyer.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-6\">\u00b612 On November 24,2009, the District Court conducted a hearing on pretrial motions, including the State\u2019s motion to exclude Dr. Peterson. Jay\u2019s counsel advised the court that Dr. Peterson would not be offering an opinion as to whether Jay suffered a seizure while driving; rather, Dr. Peterson would merely explain the typical symptoms of complex partial seizures and the difficulty in diagnosing them. The District Court excluded Dr. Peterson from testifying pursuant to M. R. Evid. 402, 403, and 702.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-7\">\u00b613 During <em>voir dire, </em>Jay\u2019s counsel questioned prospective jurors about their feelings on the presumption of innocence. Following this questioning, Jay challenged for cause potential juror Bennett because she voiced concerns about her ability to be impartial given the issue of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>drinking and driving. The District Court denied the challenge and Jay removed Bennett by exercising a peremptory challenge. During the settling of jury instructions, Jay requested the court to instruct the jury on the lesser-included offense of Driving Under the Influence (DUI) to the charges of Vehicular Homicide while Under the Influence. The court denied the request, reasoning that while DUI was a lesser-included offense, the facts of Jay\u2019s case did not support the instruction. The court did instruct the jury on the lesser-included offense of Negligent Endangerment to the charges of Criminal Endangerment.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-4\">\u00b614 The jury convicted Jay of two counts of Negligent Homicide and two counts of Negligent Endangerment. The District Court imposed a thirty year sentence in the Montana State Prison with ten years suspended. The court further ordered, over Jay\u2019s objection, that he pay the State $600 in restitution for expenses incurred in interviewing Dr. Peterson and that he was \u201cfinancially responsible for the cost of mental health treatment for the victims and their family members.\u201d Jay appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b358-6\">\u00b615 This Court reviews a district court\u2019s denial of a challenge for cause to a prospective juror for abuse of discretion. <em>State v. Allen, </em>2010 MT 214, \u00b6 20, 357 Mont. 495, 241 P.3d 1045. We review the district court\u2019s determination regarding the qualification and competency of an expert witness for an abuse of discretion. <em>State v. Bollman, </em>2012 MT 49, \u00b6 22, 364 Mont. 265, 272 P.3d 650. The trial court has <em>\u201cgreat latitude\u201d </em>in ruling on the admissibility of expert testimony. <em>State v. Crawford, </em>2003 MT 118, \u00b6 30, 315 Mont. 480, 68 P.3d 848 (emphasis in original). A district court\u2019s refusal to give an instruction on a lesser-included offense is also reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>State v. Feltz, </em>2010 MT 48, \u00b6 14, 355 Mont. 308, 227 P.3d 1035. Finally, we review restrictions or conditions on a sentence for both legality and abuse of discretion. <em>State v. Hafner, </em>2010 MT 233, \u00b6 13, 358 Mont. 137, 243 P.3d 435.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b358-8\">\u00b616 <em>Did the District Court err in denying Jay\u2019s challenge for cause?</em></p>\n<p id=\"Amx\">\u00b617 Jay argues that the District Court should have removed Bennett from the jury pool because her statements during <em>voir dire </em>that she had strong feelings against drinking and driving showed that she could not be impartial and presume Jay was innocent. The State counters that Bennett demonstrated that she was willing to put her personal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>feelings about drinking and driving aside, be impartial, and apply the law as instructed by the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-4\">\u00b618 Jay\u2019s counsel began his <em>voir dire </em>with a discussion of the presumption of innocence. Several potential jurors explained their understanding of \u201cinnocent until proven guilty.\u201d One potential juror said that she needed to see the facts of the case before deciding innocence or guilt but felt that Jay should not have been driving if he had been drinking. Shortly after, Jay\u2019s counsel had the following colloquy with a different potential juror, Bennett:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-5\">DEFENSE COUNSEL: Miss Bennett, how about you? Is that-do you think it\u2019s a natural thing, first of all, to think that because my client is sitting up here that he probably did something wrong?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ao8\">BENNETT: I don\u2019t think it feels natural in this instance, because of, you know, the questions that are being asked at this time and, you know, sort of the situation. You know, I kind of feel like, you know, in any case, I\u2019m right in the middle until I see evidence one way or the other, just like everyone else has talked about. But, we\u2019re here for a reason. And if we\u2019re here for a reason, then I can\u2019t assume complete innocence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-6\">DEFENSE COUNSEL: Okay. If you-the Judge is going to read some jury instructions, and that will be one of the jury instructions is that you are required actually to presume him innocent and maintain that presumption of innocence until you have heard all of the evidence. Is that a jury instruction-is that an instruction that you can follow?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-7\">BENNETT: I think it would be very difficult to follow, just having heard what we\u2019ve heard today.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-8\">DEFENSE COUNSEL: So you\u2019re saying that basically-</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AUr\">BENNETT: You know, if chosen for the jury trial and that\u2019s an instruction from the Judge, I\u2019m going to follow that instruction. Personally, I would find it difficult.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-9\">DEFENSE COUNSEL: Do you think you\u2019ll be able to ultimately overcome those personal feelings?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-10\">BENNETT: I would hope that, you know, based on the evidence that\u2019s provided to us, that I would make a decision based purely on what I see and what facts I have laid out in front of me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AKS\">DEFENSE COUNSEL: Okay. Do you have some fear that maybe you won\u2019t be able to do that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-11\">BENNETT: You know, I feel very passionately about driving under the influence, so there\u2019s a possibility, yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-12\">DEFENSE COUNSEL: Okay. Let me ask you this, if you were my <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>client, would you want someone with your mindset in the jury?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AmL\">BENNETT: Probably not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-4\">DEFENSE COUNSEL: Okay. And is that because, ultimately, you think you might have insurmountable difficulties putting aside those sorts of passions that you have?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-5\">BENNETT: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-6\">DEFENSE COUNSEL: Your honor, I would request that she be excused for cause.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b360-7\">The State questioned Bennett about her views.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-8\">PROSECUTOR: Your honor, just a moment. Miss Bennett, everyone comes in this courtroom with beliefs, feelings, attitudes. The question is, can you follow the law?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-9\">BENNETT: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-10\">PROSECUTOR: Okay. So you had mentioned on Defense counsel\u2019s questions, asked, just unprompted, that if that\u2019s what the Judge instructed you to do, you could follow the law?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ANB\">BENNETT: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-11\">PROSECUTOR: If the State showed you what happened and why it happened, and obviously we don\u2019t have any facts, I mean that\u2019s just the way a jury trial works, but the State proved its case beyond a reasonable doubt that the Defendant committed vehicular homicide or negligent homicide, manslaughter, to either David Hanson or Janice Thomas, could you find the Defendant guilty?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-12\">BENNETT: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-13\">PROSECUTOR: If the State did not prove the case beyond a reasonable doubt, based on what the Judge tells you, and what you believe at that time, after watching every witness and seeing every exhibit after every day of the trial, could you find the Defendant not guilty?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-14\">BENNETT: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-15\">PROSECUTOR: And simply because you have a strong feeling on DUI, is that going to affect that? Will you say he\u2019s guilty because I don\u2019t like drunk drivers, or will you say he\u2019s not guilty because the State did not prove its case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-16\">BENNETT: I would say I would make my decision based on the evidence. If it was proved beyond a reasonable doubt, I would-you know, I would have no problem finding the Defendant guilty.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AvH\">PROSECUTOR: And I\u2019m the prosecutor, so-he\u2019s the Defense attorney, but he\u2019s entitled to that. Because in theory, right, wrong or otherwise, we would hope, in theory, anyone could be sitting in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>that chair. So you don\u2019t have a problem rendering verdict solely on the evidence and the instructions by the Court?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-4\">BENNETT: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-5\">PROSECUTOR: You Honor, I would actually object. I think everyone comes in this courtroom with some belief or understanding. And if that\u2019s the standard, then no one could ever sit on a jury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-6\">THE COURT: That motion is denied.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b361-7\">\u00b619 Section 46-16-115(j), MCA, provides that a potential juror may be removed for cause if she has <em>\u201ca </em>state of mind in reference to the case or to either of the parties that would prevent the juror from acting with entire impartiality and without prejudice to the substantial rights of either party.\u201d To determine whether a juror should be excused, courts must look to the \u201ctotality of the circumstances\u201d of the witness\u2019s <em>voir dire </em>examination. <em>State v. Robinson, </em>2008 MT 34, \u00b6 8, 341 Mont. 300, 177 P.3d 488 (overruled on other grounds in <em>State v. Gunderson, </em>2010 MT 166, \u00b6 54, 357 Mont. 142, 237 P.3d 74). If questioning raises \u201cserious doubts\u201d as to the \u201cjuror\u2019s ability to be fair and impartial,\u201d the court should err on the side of caution and remove the juror. <em>Robinson, </em>\u00b6 8. A prospective juror\u2019s \u201cspontaneous statements\u201d are given more weight than \u201ccoaxed recantations\u201d elicited by counsel because spontaneous statements are \u201cmost likely to be reliable and honest.\u201d <em>Robinson, </em>\u00b6 11; <em>State v. DeVore, </em>1998 MT 340, \u00b6 28, 292 Mont. 325, 972 P.2d 816 (overruled on other grounds in <em>State v. Good, </em>2002 MT 59, \u00b6 63, 309 Mont. 113, 43 P.3d 948).</p>\n<p id=\"b361-8\">\u00b620  If a prospective juror makes statements to the effect that she <em>cannot </em>suspend her fixed beliefs and follow the law, that juror should be excused for cause. <em>Robinson, </em>\u00b6 13. On the other hand, a juror should not be removed merely because she voices a concern about being impartial-every person comes to jury duty with preconceptions. <em>Robinson, </em>\u00b6 13 (it is \u201creasonable and logical\u201d for a prospective juror to presume that there is \u201csome reason\u201d that the State charged the defendant with a crime). When a juror makes comments suggesting a fixed opinion as to the defendant\u2019s guilt but then says she can set that opinion to the side and follow the law, it is \u201cwithin the discretion of the district court\u201d to decide whether the juror will be able to be impartial:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A1M\">When a juror makes conflicting statements ... the decision whether to grant a challenge for cause is within the discretion of the trial court, who has the ability to look into the eyes of the juror in question, and to consider her responses in the context of the courtroom, and then determine whether serious doubts exist <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>about the juror\u2019s ability to be impartial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b362-4\"><em>Robinson, </em>\u00b6 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-5\">\u00b621 Our prior cases illustrate the difference between a potential juror who has a \u201cfixed opinion\u201d and a potential juror who has mere preconceptions. In <em>State v. Falls Down, </em>2003 MT 300, \u00b6\u00b6 25-26, 28, 31, 33, 318 Mont. 219, 79 P.3d 797, four potential jurors indicated that they had formed opinions as to Falls Down\u2019s guilt of deliberate homicide based on media coverage. Upon further questioning, they all agreed that they would be able to set their preconceptions aside, follow the law, and presume Falls Down was innocent until proven guilty. We affirmed the district court\u2019s refusal to remove the potential jurors for cause because they were not \u201cfixed\u201d or \u201cset\u201d in their opinions of the defendant\u2019s guilt. <em>Falls Down, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 27, 30, 32, 35.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-6\">\u00b622 In contrast, in <em>DeVore, </em>\u00b6 16, two potential jurors indicated that DeVore was \u201cguilty of something\u201d or he would not have been charged with a crime. DeVore challenged these jurors for cause, on the grounds that their statements showed they could not be impartial and presume DeVore innocent until proven guilty. <em>DeVore, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 17-18. Before ruling, the district court instructed DeVore\u2019s counsel to discuss the presumption of innocence with the jurors. <em>DeVore, </em>\u00b6 17. The two prospective jurors responded to this discussion by stating that, although they would not find DeVore guilty until they heard all of the evidence, they still thought he was \u201cinvolved\u201d or \u201cguilty of something\u201d or he would not have been charged. <em>DeVore, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 18-19. The district court rejected DeVore\u2019s challenge for cause, and we reversed. <em>DeVore, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 1, 20. We held that because the potential jurors had continued to adhere to their beliefs about DeVore\u2019s guilt, the district court should have excused them for having a fixed opinion: \u201c[Disqualification based on a juror\u2019s alleged prejudice is necessary only where jurors \u2018form fixed opinions on the guilt or innocence of the defendant which they would not be able to lay aside and render a verdict based solely on the evidence presented in court.\u2019 \u201d <em>DeVore, </em>\u00b6 21 (quoting <em>Great Falls Tribune v. Dist. Ct., </em>186 Mont. 433, 439-40, 608 P.2d 116, 120 (1980)). We reached the same conclusion under similar facts in <em>State v. Braunreiter, </em>2008 MT 197, \u00b6 13, 344 Mont. 59, 185 P.3d 1024 (holding that prospective juror\u2019s lukewarm agreement to follow the law was insufficient to dissipate concerns raised by his initial responses).</p>\n<p id=\"b362-7\">\u00b623 Here, Bennett\u2019s comments are closer to the juror statements in <em>Falls Down </em>than the juror comments in <em>DeVore </em>or Braunreiter. While Bennett was clear that she had preconceptions about people that drink and drive, she did not make comments demonstrating a \u201cfixed opinion\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>as to Jay\u2019s guilt. Indeed, without prompting, Bennett told Jay\u2019s counsel that although she would find it personally difficult to presume Jay innocent, she could and would do so: \u2018You know, if chosen for the jury trial and that\u2019s an instruction from the Judge, I\u2019m going to follow that instruction. Personally, I would find it difficult.\u201d It was following this initial, spontaneous response that Jay\u2019s counsel asked Bennett a series of leading questions that revealed the difficulty Bennett would have in setting aside her feelings, and the prosecutor asked a series of leading questions revealing that Bennett would set her personal feelings aside, apply the law, and presume Jay innocent until proven guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-4\">\u00b624  Bennett\u2019s somewhat contradictory responses to counsels\u2019 leading questions are why we give more weight to \u201cspontaneous\u201d statements than \u201ccoaxed recantations.\u201d <em>Robinson, </em>\u00b6 8. Bennett expressed agreement both with Jay\u2019s counsel that it would be difficult for her to be impartial and with the prosecutor that she would be impartial and follow the law. The response \u201cmost likely to be reliable and trustworthy,\u201d <em>Robinson, </em>\u00b6 8, was Bennett\u2019s earlier spontaneous statement that she would follow the law even though she would find it personally difficult. This statement demonstrated a preconception and not a \u201cfixed opinion.\u201d We conclude that the record fails to demonstrate that Bennett had \u201ca state of mind in reference to the case or to either of the parties that would prevent the juror from acting with entire impartiality and without prejudice to the substantial rights of either party.\u201d Section 46-16-115(j), MCA. The District Court did not abuse its discretion in denying the challenge for cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">\u00b625 <em>Did the District Court err in excluding Jay\u2019s expert witness on complex partial seizures?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b363-6\">\u00b626 The District Court excluded Dr. Peterson from testifying about complex partial seizures on the ground that Jay failed to demonstrate a \u201cnexus\u201d between such a seizure and his driving. Jay argues this was error because the unexplained nature of his driving was enough to raise the possibility that he had suffered a seizure.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-7\">\u00b627 The admission of expert testimony is governed by M. R. Evid. 701-705. M. R. Evid. 702 provides that expert testimony in the form of \u201can opinion or otherwise\u201d is admissible if it will assist the jury in deciding the case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-8\">If scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge will assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue, a witness qualified as an expert by knowledge, skill, experience, training or education may testify thereto in the form of an opinion <em>or otherwise.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b364-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>(Emphasis added.) The Commission Comments to Rule 702 explain that the \u201cor otherwise\u201d language allows \u201can expert to give testimony which need not be in the form of opinion, but which informs the jury so they may render the correct decision.\u201d Section 26-10-Rule 702, Commission Comments at 393 (2012).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Commentators have opined that Rule 702 permits an expert to \u201cgive test results, describe recognized principles of their specialized knowledge, provide general background, or simply to explain other evidence.\u201d Charles Alan Wright &amp; Victor James Gold, <em>Federal Practice and Procedure, </em>vol. 29, \u00a7 6263, 197 (West 1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b364-4\">\u00b628 <em>State v.

In <em>Cassill, </em>bank employees were charged with falsifying a bank\u2019s ledgers and financial disclosures. <em>Cassill, 70 </em>Mont, at 435-36, 227 P. at 50-51. During trial, the State called witnesses experienced in accounting and bookkeeping to explain the meaning of various entries in the bank\u2019s ledgers to the jury. <em>Cassill, 70 </em>Mont, at 448, 227 P. at 55. These experts did not testify as to whether the defendants had falsified entries; rather, they explained how a ledger worked and what different entries meant. <em>Cassill, 70 </em>Mont, at 448-49, 227 P. at 55. We \u201cfound the explanations illuminative and useful and have no doubt served to enlighten the jury\u201d and affirmed the District Court\u2019s admission of the testimony. <em>Cassill, 70 </em>Mont, at 449, 227 P. at 55.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">\u00b629 Of course, not all exposition testimony will necessarily \u201cassist\u201d or \u201cenlighten the jury.\u201d Like all evidence, expert testimony must be relevant, or have the \u201ctendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.\u201d M. R. Evid. 401. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>Thus, it has been noted that \u201cin order for expert testimony to be relevant there must be a connection between the expert\u2019s [testimony] and fact testimony.\u201d 32 C.J.S. <em>Evidence </em>\u00a7 804, at 465 (West 2008); <em>accord U.S. v. Downing, </em>753 F.2d 1224, 1242 (3rd Cir. 1985) (\u201cAn additional consideration under Rule 702-and another aspect of relevancy-is whether expert testimony proffered in the case is sufficiently tied to the facts of the case that it will aid the jury in resolving a factual dispute.\u201d); <em>Exxon Pipeline Co. v. Zwahr, </em>88 S.W.3d 623, 629 (Tex. 2002) (noting that expert testimony is only relevant when it is \u201csufficiently tied to the facts of the case that it will aid the jury in resolving a factual dispute.\u201d) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b365-4\">\u00b630 In seeking to introduce Dr. Peterson\u2019s exposition testimony about complex partial seizures, Jay\u2019s counsel explained that Dr. Peterson\u2019s testimony would educate the jury without giving an opinion as to whether Jay, in fact, had suffered a seizure:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b365-5\">[W]hen you look at Rule 702, experts do not have to give statements in terms of opinions only. They can be opinions or testimony, or other testimony. In this case, I think the other testimony that Dr. Peterson could give would be educating the jury about complex partial seizures and how that, how you can\u2019t rule that out in this case when, you know, the level of proof for defense is to show that there is a reasonable doubt.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b365-6\">Thus, Jay\u2019s position was that the basis for educating the jury about complex partial seizures was that Dr. Peterson could not rule out the possibility that Jay had suffered a seizure while driving.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-7\">\u00b631  However, Dr. Peterson had never spoken to Jay or any of his previous treating physicians; he had not been provided with Jay\u2019s medical history, other than an \u201cunremarkable\u201d EEG; nor had he been provided with the medical history of Jay\u2019s family. Dr. Peterson\u2019s testimony was potentially complicated and, as Jay acknowledges, \u201cseizures are difficult to diagnose, even for experts.\u201d No evidentiary connection was established between seizures and Jay\u2019s driving. Dr. Peterson\u2019s testimony would not serve to assist the jury as in <em>Cassill, </em>where expert testimony about bookkeeping methods gave the jury the tools necessary to determin e if the bank\u2019s ledgers accurately reflected its assets. While we agree that Jay did not need to provide a \u201cdefinitive medical diagnosis of a seizure,\u201d he was required to establish <em>some </em>factual connection between the offered expert testimony and his driving in this case to make the testimony relevant. M. R. Evid. 402. Expert testimony about a causal theory that was not connected to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>facts of the case could well serve to confuse the jury. We conclude the District Court did not abuse its discretion in excluding Dr. Peterson\u2019s expository testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-4\">\u00b632 Jay argues alternatively that even if the District Court properly applied Rule 702, the exclusion of Dr. Peterson\u2019s testimony nonetheless violated his right to present a defense. The Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and the Compulsory Process and Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment \u201cguarantee!] criminal defendants \u2018a meaningful opportunity to present a complete defense.\u2019 \u201d <em>Holmes v. S.C., </em>547 U.S. 319, 324, 126 S. Ct. 1722, 1731 (2006) (quoting <em>Crane v. Ky., </em>476 U.S. 683, 690, 106 S. Ct. 2142, 2142 (1986)). This right to present a defense can be \u201cabridged by evidence rules that infringe upon a weighty interest of the accused and are arbitrary or disproportionate to the purposes they are designed to serve.\u201d <em>Holmes, </em>547 U.S. at 324, 126 S. Ct. at 1731 (internal brackets and quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">\u00b633 The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals has rejected a similar due process challenge. <em>Moses v. Payne, </em>555 F.3d 742, 760 (9th Cir. 2008). In <em>Moses, </em>the defendant was charged with shooting and killing his wife. The defendant alleged that she shot herself. The defendant sought to call at trial a doctor who would testify that the victim was depressed and that depression increased the likelihood of suicide. <em>Moses, </em>555 F.3d at 749. The trial court excluded the evidence under Rule 702. <em>Moses, </em>555 F.3d at 750. In a subsequent habeas proceeding, the Ninth Circuit held that this application of Rule 702 did not impermissibly infringe on the defendant\u2019s right to present a defense. <em>Moses, </em>555 F.3d at 760. The Ninth Circuit recognized that unlike the state evidentiary rules that have been struck down by the Supreme Court,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Rule 702 was a \u201c \u2018well-established rule of evidence\u2019 that permits a court to exercise its discretion in admitting expert testimony when relevant\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b366-6\">Indeed, Rule 702 is different in kind from the rules [struck down <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>by the Supreme Court]. The evidentiary rules in those cases, by their terms, required the trial court to exclude crucial evidence that had a critical effect on the trial, with little or no rational justification. In general, the rules precluded a defendant from testifying, excluded testimony from key percipient witnesses, or excluded the introduction of all evidence relating to a crucial defense. In contrast, Rule 702 does not require a trial court to exclude evidence. Rather, it authorizes a court to admit expert testimony if it will assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or a fact in issue.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b367-4\"><em>Moses, </em>555 F.3d at 758 (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting <em>Holmes, </em>547 U.S. at 326, 126 S. Ct. 1227). Because Rule 702 is rationally related to the important goal of admitting only expert testimony that has a logical connection to the central issues of the case, the Ninth Circuit upheld it as constitutional. <em>Moses, </em>555 F.3d at 758.</p>\n<p id=\"A1e\">\u00b634 We concur with the Ninth Circuit\u2019s reasoning in <em>Moses. </em>Here, the District Court determined that Dr. Peterson\u2019s testimony would not assist the jury because it had a weak, arguably nonexistent, connection to Jay\u2019s driving on October 3, 2008. Therefore, the District Court\u2019s application of Rule 702 did not abridge Jay\u2019s constitutional right to present his defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">\u00b635 Finally, Jay argues that if the District Court properly excluded Dr. Peterson\u2019s testimony because it bore no connection to Jay\u2019s driving, then his lawyer provided ineffective assistance by failing to establish a connection. Jay argues his lawyer could have made that connection by: (1) submitting Jay\u2019s family\u2019s history of seizures to the court, and/or (2) having Dr. Peterson run medical tests on Jay to determine if he had a seizure. Jay\u2019s lawyer did neither. The State argues that Jay\u2019s ineffective assistance claim is non-record based and, therefore, must be addressed in postconviction proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-6\">\u00b636 \u201cThis Court may review a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel on direct appeal only when the record \u2018fully explains why counsel took, or failed to take, action in providing a defense for the accused.\u2019 \u201d <em>Longjaw v. State, </em>2012 MT 243, \u00b6 19, 366 Mont. 427, 288 P.3d 210 (quoting <em>State v. Deschon, </em>2004 MT 32 \u00b6 31, 320 Mont. 1, 85 P.3d 756). In <em>State v. White, </em>2001 MT 149, \u00b6 20, 306 Mont. 58, 30 P.3d 340, we explained that \u201cthe definitive question that distinguishes and decides which actions are record and which are non-record is why? ... [D]oes the record fully explain <em>why </em>counsel took the particular course of action?\u201d (Emphasis in original.) \u201cWhen ineffective assistance of counsel claims are non-record based, the-proper avenue for review is through <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>a petition for postconviction relief.\u201d <em>Longjaw, </em>\u00b6 20.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-4\">\u00b637  Here, the record does not \u201cfully explain\u201d why Jay\u2019s counsel did not make further effort to establish a connection between seizures and Jay\u2019s driving. While Jay claims that his counsel was deficient by failing to submit to the District Court evidence that members of his family had suffered seizures, thereby showing that he is genetically predisposed to seizures, there is no evidence in the record of his family\u2019s medical history. Jay also claims his counsel was deficient for failing to have Dr. Peterson test Jay to determine if he had suffered a seizure. However, Jay\u2019s counsel may have had a tactically sound strategy for not doing so-he may have believed that a full medical examination would hurt Jay\u2019s case. Jay\u2019s counsel may have sought to gain the benefits of Dr. Peterson\u2019s testimony (providing the jury with an alternative explanation of Jay\u2019s driving) without incurring any risks (Dr. Peterson concluding after examining Jay that he had not suffered a seizure). This strategy is not foreclosed by the record and thus does not fully explain why Jay\u2019s counsel \u201ctook the particular course of action\u201d he did. <em>Longjaw, </em>\u00b6 20. Jay\u2019s claim is appropriately reserved for postconviction proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">\u00b638 <em>Did the District Court err when it refused to instruct the jury on DUI as a lesser-included offense of Vehicular Homicide While Under the Influence?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b368-6\">\u00b639 The District Court rejected Jay\u2019s request to instruct the jury on DUI as a lesser-included offense of Vehicular Homicide while Under the Influence because it concluded that the evidence did not support the instruction. To determine if a lesser-included offense instruction should have been given at trial, we follow the two-step approach articulated in <em>State v. Castle, </em>285 Mont. 363, 368, 948 P.2d 688, 690-91 (1997). First, we determine if, as a matter of law, the offense for which the instruction is requested is a lesser-included offense of the offense charged. Then, we determine if the lesser-included instruction is supported by the evidence of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-7\">\u00b640 A lesser included offense is defined as an offense that \u201cis established by proof of the same or less than all the facts required to establish the commission of the offense charged[.]\u201d Section 46-1-202(9)(a). \u201c \u2018[F]acts\u2019 \u2018in subsection (a) of \u00a7 46-1-202(9), MCA refers to the statutory elements of the charged offense and not to the individual facts of the case.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Molenda, </em>2010 MT 215, \u00b6 7, 358 Mont. 1, 243 P.3d 387 (quoting <em>State v.

The statute incorporates the elements of a DUI offense as necessary elements of the Vehicular Homicide offense. Therefore, a DUI offense is \u201cestablished by proof of the same or less than all the [elements] required to establish the commission of [Vehicular Homicide While Under the Influence],\u201d and is a lesser-included offense. Section 46-l-202(9)(a), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-4\">\u00b642 Under the second step of <em>Castle, </em>a lesser-included offense instruction must be given when \u201cthe jury, based on the evidence, could be warranted in finding the defendant guilty of a lesser included offense.\u201d Section 46-16-607(2); <em>Castle, </em>285 Mont, at 369, 948 P.2d at 691. \u201cA lesser-included offense instruction is not supported by the evidence when the defendant\u2019s evidence or theory, if believed, would require an acquittal.\u201d <em>State v.

The girl accused Grindheim of grabbing her and forcing her head down on his penis even though she had told him \u201cno\u201d and that \u201cshe did not want to.\u201d <em>Grindheim, </em>\u00b6 11. Grindheim\u2019s defense at trial was that the girl had awoken him in the middle of the night by touching him in a sexual manner, and that he had responded by immediately leaving the couch and sleeping outside. <em>Grindheim, </em>\u00b6 41. Grindheim asked the court to instruct the jury on the lesser-included crime of \u201cendangering the welfare of a child.\u201d <em>Grindheim, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 38-39. The trial court refused the instruction, and we affirmed, reasoning that Grindheim\u2019s theory of the facts supported his outright acquittal, not a conviction for endangerment of children:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-6\">Even were we to accept Grindheim\u2019s assertion that the offense of endangerment of children was a lesser-included offense, the evidence in this trial would not have supported Grindheim\u2019s conviction of that offense, but rather, would instead have supported Grindheim\u2019s acquittal. Grindheim\u2019s evidence and theory was that some \u201cunknown person\u201d unzipped his sleeping <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>bag and began \u201cmessing around\u201d with him in a sexual manner. After he realized what was going on, he asserted that he jumped off the couch, took his sleeping bag, and went out to sleep in the yard. Thus, Grindheim\u2019s evidence and theory does not offer proof of \u201cassisting, promoting or encouraging\u201d a child to engage in sexual conduct pursuant to \u00a7 45-5-622(2)(b)(ii), MCA. Therefore, we conclude the District Court did not abuse its discretion in denying Grindheim\u2019s requested lesser-included offense instruction.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b370-4\"><em>Grindheim, </em>\u00b6 41.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">\u00b644 Here, Jay\u2019s theory of the facts supported his outright acquittal, not a conviction for DUI. Jay\u2019s defense was that he was unconscious when his pickup drove through the grass median, into oncoming traffic, and the wrong way on 1-90 for one-fifth of a mile. Jay testified that he drank a few beers prior to the crash, but that he did not feel impaired and, consistent with this testimony, Jay\u2019s counsel extensively argued during closing arguments that Jay was unconscious and not under the influence of alcohol. Thus, Jay\u2019s theory was that he had \u201clost consciousness\u201d for a reason other than alcohol consumption. Because J ay\u2019s \u201ctheory, if believed, would require an acquittal,\u201d a lesser-included instruction for DUI was \u201cnot supported by the evidence[.j\u201d <em>Burkhart, </em>\u00b6 39; <em>German, </em>\u00b6 11; <em>Martinez, </em>\u00b6 10, <em>Schmalz, </em>\u00b6 23; <em>Howell, </em>\u00b6 34; <em>Grindheim, </em>\u00b6 41. The District Court did not abuse its discretion by refusing to give the lesser-included instruction to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-6\">\u00b645 <em>Did the District Court err when it ordered Jay to pay restitution to the State and the victims and their family members?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b370-7\">\u00b646 The District Court ordered Jay to pay restitution to the State in the amount of $600 for the costs related to its pretrial interview of Dr. Peterson. The court also ordered that Jay was \u201cfinancially responsible\u201d for the cost of \u201cmental health treatment for the victims and their family members[,j\u201d but did not impose a specific amount of this obligation. Jay argues that the $600 award to the State was improper because the State was not the victim of the crime, and the obligation to pay for the victims\u2019 mental health treatment was improper because the total amount of restitution was not specified.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-8\">\u00b647 The State concedes that the District Court\u2019s open-ended restitution award for mental health treatment was error. Section 46-18-244(1) requires the sentencing court to \u201cspecify the total amount of restitution that the offender shall pay.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b370-9\">\u00b648 We conclude that the District Court\u2019s restitution award of $600 to the State for costs incurred in interviewing Dr. Peterson was also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>error. Section 46-18-201(5) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-4\">[I]f a person has been found guilty of an offense upon a verdict of guilty ... and the sentencing judge finds that a victim, as defined in 46-18-243, has sustained a pecuniary loss, the sentencing judge shall, as part of the sentence, require payment of full restitution to the victim!.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">Section 46-18-243(2)(a) defines \u201cvictim\u201d to include a governmental entity only when that entity suffers property damage in the commission of a crime, or incurs costs in the investigation or apprehension of an escaped person. Here, the State did not suffer property damage or incur costs apprehending Jay, but rather incurred expenses by interviewing a potential defense witness. The State was not a \u201cvictim\u201d entitled to restitution. <em>State v.
