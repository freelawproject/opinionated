Hicks (Hicks) appeals from his convictions of deliberate homicide and solicitation to tamper with physical evidence in the Eighth Judicial District Court, Cascade County. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-8\">\u00b62 Hicks presents the following issues for review:</p>\n<p id=\"b188-9\">\u00b63 <em>Issue One: Whether the District Court properly concluded that assault on a minor is a forcible felony under the deliberate homicide statute.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b188-10\">\u00b64 <em>Issue Two: Whether the District Court properly denied Hicks\u2019s motion in limine to exclude from evidence a portion of the police\u2019s videotaped interrogation of Hicks.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b188-11\">PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b188-12\">\u00b65 Three-year-old K.B. died on March 1, 2010, from severe brain injuries that she suffered after Hicks shoved her into a wall on February 26,2010. Hicks had been dating KB.\u2019s mother, Jessica Bray (Bray), during the months preceding KB.\u2019s death. Hicks, Bray, and Bray\u2019s two children were living together at the time of the incident.</p>\n<p id=\"APc\">\u00b66 On the afternoon of February 26th, Hicks was taking care of K.B. by himself while Bray was at work. Hicks called Bray shortly after 1:20 in the afternoon to inform her that something was wrong with K.B. Hicks told Bray that their puppy had knocked K.B. down the stairs, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>and K.B. was not responding. Bray told Hicks to hang up the phone immediately and to call 9-1-1, which he did. Hicks told the dispatcher that K.B. had fallen down the stairs and that she was not responsive. Emergency responders arrived at the house minutes later. They instantly recognized severe injuries when they saw K.B. and immediately transported her to the hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-4\">\u00b67 At the hospital, a CT scan revealed that K.B. had a serious brain injury. The doctors diagnosed K.B. with a subdural hematoma and severe cerebral edema. Although she was taken into surgery at once, the procedure was not successful.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">\u00b68 Because RB.\u2019s injuries were not consistent with injuries that a child would normally suffer after falling down carpeted stairs, the police took Hicks in for further questioning. Hicks waived his <em>Miranda </em>rights and agreed to talk to detectives. Hicks initially was adamant that the dog had knocked K.B. down the stairs. He said that he had been doing homework when he heard what sounded like a bowling ball fall down the stairs. He said that he had rushed over to the base of the stairs where he saw the puppy standing over K.B, so he threw the puppy to get it away from her. Hicks claimed that the puppy hit and dented the drywall.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-6\">\u00b69 As the interview progressed, Hicks acknowledged that the puppy did not dent the wall. He told the detectives that K.B.\u2019s head actually made the dent when he lost his temper and shoved her into the wall. Hicks claimed that K.B. was crying after he had assaulted her but otherwise seemed to be okay. According to Hicks, he asked K.B. if she was hurt and then told her to go upstairs to get her coat so that they could go to the store. Hicks told the detectives that he went to finish his homework and that was when he heard K.B. fall down the stairs. \u00b610 One of the detectives retrieved a child-sized mannequin. The detective acknowledged that the mannequin was not the same size as K.B. but asked Hicks to demonstrate how hard he had pushed K.B. Hicks complied. He took the mannequin and threw it into the wall. The detectives asked Hicks if the amount of force that he had used in the demonstration was the same amount of force that he had used when he shoved K.B. Hicks confirmed that it was.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-7\">\u00b611 The doctors declared K.B. brain dead on March 1, 2010. Prosecutors charged Hicks with deliberate homicide on March 11, 2010. He was also charged with solicitation to tamper with physical evidence for asking his mother to retrieve items from the house that he knew could be incriminating.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>\u00b612 Prior to trial, Hicks filed a motion in limine to exclude from evidence the portion of the videotaped interrogation in which Hicks demonstrated how hard he had pushed K.B. Hicks argued that the demonstration was inaccurate and more prejudicial than probative. The District Court initially reserved judgment but later denied Hicks\u2019s motion during trial. The entire video of the interrogation was admitted into evidence and shown to the jury. Prior to the opening statements but after the jury was empanelled and sworn-in, Hicks moved to dismiss the deliberate homicide charge. He argued that assault on a minor was not a forcible felony under the deliberate homicide statute. The District Court denied Hicks\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-4\">\u00b613 On November 22, 2010, after a six-day trial, the jury convicted Hicks of both deliberate homicide and solicitation to tamper with physical evidence. The District Court sentenced Hicks to one-hundred years in the Montana State Prison with a twenty-five year parole restriction for deliberate homicide. For solicitation to tamper with physical evidence, Hicks received a concurrent five year prison sentence.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b190-6\">\u00b614 We review de novo a district court\u2019s interpretation of a statute. <em>State v. Cooksey, </em>2012 MT 226, \u00b6 32, 366 Mont. 346, 286 P.3d 1174; <em>State v. Daniels, </em>2011 MT 278, \u00b6 11, 362 Mont. 426, 265 P.3d 623. A district court\u2019s denial of a motion in limine is an evidentiary ruling. <em>State v. Meredith, </em>2010 MT 27, \u00b6 42, 355 Mont. 148, 226 P.3d 571. We review evidentiary rulings for an abuse of discretion. <em>Meredith, </em>\u00b6 42. A trial court abuses its discretion when it \u201cacts arbitrarily without the employment of conscientious judgment or exceeds the bounds of reason, resulting in substantial injustice.\u201d <em>State v. Derbyshire, </em>2009 MT 27, \u00b6 19, 349 Mont. 114, 201 P.3d 811.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b190-8\">\u00b615 <em>Issue One: Whether the District Court properly concluded that assault on a minor is a forcible felony under the deliberate homicide statute.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b190-9\">\u00b616 Hicks was charged with deliberate homicide, felony-murder, pursuant to \u00a7 45-5-102(l)(b), MCA. A person commits felony-murder <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>when the person attempts to commit, commits, or is legally accountable for the attempt or commission of a forcible felony and in the course of the forcible felony or flight thereafter, the person or any person legally accountable for the crime causes the death of another human being. Section 45-5-102(l)(b), MCA; <em>State v. Billedeaux, </em>2001 MT 9, \u00b6 10, 304 Mont. 89, 18 P.3d 990; <em>State v. Kills on Top, </em>241 Mont. 378, 386-87, 787 P.2d 336, 341 (1990). Although \u00a7 45-5-102(l)(b), MCA, specifically lists a number of felonies that can serve as a predicate offense, the statute provides that any forcible felony can support a charge of felony-murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-4\">\u00b617 Prosecutors alleged assault on a minor as the predicate offense for Hicks\u2019s felony-murder charge. Hicks argues that assault on a minor is not a forcible felony because the underlying offense of assault on a minor is misdemeanor assault. Assault on a minor incorporates the elements of misdemeanor assault but also requires that the offender be 18 years of age or older and that the victim be younger than 14 years old. Section 45-5-212, MCA. Because misdemeanor assault and assault on a minor proscribe the same conduct and require the same mental state, and because misdemeanor assault cannot support a charge of felony-murder, Hicks contends that assault on a minor also cannot support a charge of felony-murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">\u00b618 Hicks further argues that the legislative history of \u00a7 45-5-102(l)(b), MCA, demonstrates that the legislature did not intend assault on a minor to be a felony-murder predicate offense. He argues that if the legislature had intended assault on a minor to be a predicate offense, then the legislature would have included it as one of the specifically listed forcible felonies.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-6\">\u00b619 We seek to implement the legislature\u2019s intent when we interpret a statute. <em>In re K.M.G., </em>2010 MT 81, \u00b6 26, 356 Mont. 91,229 P.3d 1227. We look first to the plain language of the statute to determine legislative intent. <em>In re K.M.G., </em>\u00b6 26; <em>Cooksey, </em>\u00b6 32. When the plain language of the statute is clear, no other means of interpretation are necessary or proper. <em>Cooksey, </em>\u00b6 32; <em>City of Missoula v. Cox, </em>2008 MT 364, \u00b6 9, 346 Mont. 422, 196 P.3d 452; <em>State v. Roberts, </em>2010 MT 110, \u00b6 10, 356 Mont. 290, 233 P.3d 324. We do not insert that which the legislature omitted, nor do we omit that which the legislature has inserted. Section 1-2-101, <em>MCA;In reK.M.G., </em>\u00b6 26; <em>Cooksey, </em>\u00b6 32. Only when the language of the statute is ambiguous do we resort to the statute\u2019s legislative history. <em>State v. Merry, </em>2008 MT 288, \u00b6 17, 345 Mont. 390, 191 P.3d 428; <em>In re K.M.G., </em>\u00b6 26.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-7\">\u00b620 Section 45-5-102(l)(b), MCA, is clear that any forcible felony can <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>support a charge of felony-murder. The statutes that define a forcible felony are unambiguous and require no interpretation beyond their plain language. A forcible felony is any felony that \u201cinvolves the use or threat of physical force or violence against any individual.\u201d Section 45-2-101(24), MCA. A felony is any offense that carries a potential sentence of death or imprisonment in a state prison for a term exceeding one year. Section 45-2-101(23), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-4\">\u00b621  Assault on a minor is punishable by imprisonment in a state prison for up to five years. Section 45-5-212, MCA. Misdemeanor assault is punishable by imprisonment in a county jail for up to six months. Section 45-5-201, MCA. By codifying assault on a minor as an offense distinct from misdemeanor assault with significantly enhanced penalties, the legislature emphasized the increased severity of the offense when an adult assaults a child. Because assault on a minor is punishable by five years of imprisonment in a state prison, it is a felony.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">\u00b622  As alleged by the State, Hicks\u2019s assault on K.B. involved the use of physical force or violence against another person. The District Court correctly determined that assault on a minor, as alleged by the State, is a forcible felony and properly denied Hicks\u2019s motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-6\">\u00b623 <em>Issue Two: Whether the District Court properly denied Hicks\u2019s motion in limine to exclude from evidence a portion of the police\u2019s videotaped interrogation of Hicks.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b192-7\">\u00b624 Hicks argues that the video of his demonstration of how he had pushed K.B. was substantially more prejudicial than probative. Atrial court may exclude relevant evidence if it determines that the evidence\u2019s probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice. M. R. Evid. 403. Probative evidence in criminal proceedings is usually, if not always, prejudicial to the defendant. <em>State v. Pittman, </em>2005 MT 70, \u00b6 27, 326 Mont. 324, 109 P.3d 237. In fact, the prosecutor must present evidence that is prejudicial to the defendant to obtain a conviction. It is only when the evidence is <em>unfairly </em>prejudicial that it may be excluded under M. R. Evid. 403. <em>State v. Bieber, </em>2007 MT 262, \u00b6 59, 339 Mont. 309, 170 P.3d 444. Evidence may be unfairly prejudicial if it arouses the jury\u2019s hostility or sympathy for one side without regard to its probative value, if it confuses or misleads the trier of fact, or if it unduly distracts from the main issues. <em>State v. Huether, </em>284 Mont. 259, 265, 943 P.2d 1291, 1295 (1997) (citing <em>State v. Thompson, </em>263 Mont. 17, 28-29, 865 P.2d 1125, 1132 (1993)). The trial court has discretion to decide whether the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>danger of unfair prejudice substantially outweighs the evidence\u2019s probative value. <em>Bieber, </em>\u00b6 59.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-4\">\u00b625 Hicks contends that the reenactment should not have been admitted into evidence because he admitted that he had pushed K.B. into the wall, and the video reenactment was therefore not probative of any material fact in question. Hicks further asserts that the reenactment was grossly inaccurate and did not fairly portray the parties or the circumstances. Hicks claims that the reenactment was flawed because the mannequin was much smaller and lighter than K.B., because the interrogation room\u2019s walls were cement and not sheetrock like the apartment\u2019s walls, and because the detectives failed to confirm with Hicks that the demonstration accurately depicted the parties\u2019 respective positions and how he had grabbed K.B.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">\u00b626  Despite Hicks\u2019s contention, the video of the reenactment was probative of a material fact in question and clearly was relevant to whether Hicks caused KB.\u2019s death. At trial, Hicks\u2019s counsel admitted that Hicks had committed assault on a minor. He defended against the deliberate homicide charge, however, by arguing that K.B.\u2019s fatal injuries could not have resulted from being shoved into the wall. Hicks\u2019s counsel argued during closing that the small dent in the wall would have been much larger if Hicks had shoved K.B. with the force necessary to cause the severe injuries that led to her death. The prosecution argued that K.B.\u2019s death was the direct result of her head being slammed into the wall with severe force. Hicks\u2019s reenactment demonstrated how hard he had shoved K.B., which was probative of one of the main facts in question-whether Hicks had caused KB.\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-6\">\u00b627  Moreover, the District Court did not abuse its discretion when it determined that the probative value of the video was not substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice. As the District Court noted, the video certainly was powerful and graphic. It was incriminating and prejudicial to Hicks, but not unfairly so. Hicks was not coerced in any way. Hicks selected the amount of force to use. After the demonstration, Hicks confirmed that he had shoved the mannequin with the same amount of force that he had used when he shoved K.B.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-7\">\u00b628  It was not outside the bounds of reason for the District Court to conclude that the jury could account for the demonstration\u2019s flaws when considering the video evidence. The flaws in Hicks\u2019s demonstration did not create danger of unfair prejudice that substantially outweighs the video\u2019s probative value. The danger of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>unfair prejudice was slight. The jury was capable of understanding that the mannequin was smaller than K.B. and that the walls in the interrogation room were a different material than the wall that K.B.\u2019s head had dented. Hicks was free to point out the flaws of the demonstration at trial and to argue to the jury that it should afford little weight to the video due to those flaws. Hicks\u2019s demonstration did not distract from the main issues, confuse or mislead the jury, or arouse the jury\u2019s hostility without regard to the video\u2019s probative value. The District Court did not abuse its discretion by admitting the entire video into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-4\">\u00b629 For the reasons stated above, Hicks\u2019s convictions are affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b194-5\">JUSTICES COTTER, BAKER, WHEAT and MORRIS concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b190-10\"> The solicitation conviction was not raised in the appellate briefs and therefore is not addressed in this opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
