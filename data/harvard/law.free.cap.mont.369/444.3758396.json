We affirm the District Court\u2019s entry of summary judgment in favor of the Bank on all of Feller\u2019s claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-10\">ISSUES</p>\n<p id=\"b467-11\">\u00b62 Feller raises the following three issues on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b467-12\">\u00b63 1. Did the District Court err by granting summary judgment to the Bank based on preemption by the federal Fair Credit Reporting Act?</p>\n<p id=\"b467-13\">\u00b64 2. Did the District Court err in denying Feller\u2019s motion for partial summary judgment and granting the Bank\u2019s motion for summary judgment on Feller\u2019s conversion claim?</p>\n<p id=\"b467-14\">\u00b65 3. Did the District Court err in dismissing Feller\u2019s emotional distress claims?</p>\n<p id=\"b467-15\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b467-16\">\u00b66 Feller\u2019s allegations stem from the actions of a former Bank employee, Diane Becker (Becker), who is now serving a sentence in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>federal prison related to an embezzlement scheme. Becker worked as a vice president of the Bank\u2019s Hardin branch and assisted Feller with her banking and finances. Feller also had a personal relationship with Becker. Becker is married to Feller\u2019s ex-husband and Feller described her as a friend. Becker\u2019s criminal scheme involved booking phony loans or lines of credit in the names of relatives or acquaintances and appropriating these funds for her personal use. Becker was suspended from her employment at the Bank in late 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-4\">\u00b67 Feller had been a customer of the Bank for many years and had a home mortgage loan through the Bank. Becker was Feller\u2019s primary contact at the Bank. After Becker\u2019s suspension, the Bank\u2019s audit department sent Feller a letter on December 28,2007, asking Feller to confirm whether the Bank\u2019s records accurately reflected the loan and account balances in her name. The letter contained information on two loans other than her home mortgage loan. Feller checked the box on the form stating that that information was correct, and returned the documents to the Bank on January 3, 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">\u00b68 In April 2008, Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) agents visited Feller and questioned her about her knowledge of financial dealings involving Becker. At the time of the interview, Feller was aware that Becker had been suspended by the Bank but claimed that she did not know the reasons for the suspension. Feller testified in a deposition that she was \u201cterrified\u201d by the interview because it was intimated that Feller was somehow involved in Becker\u2019s illegal actions. Feller went on to testify in her deposition, however, that the FBI agents were professional and did nothing improper. Feller was told not to talk about the investigation. The Bank was not involved in the questioning of Feller.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-6\">\u00b69 Soon after the FBI questioning, Feller spoke with Bank employee Tom Hopfauf (Hopfauf) about refinancing her home mortgage to avoid an upcoming balloon payment. Hopfauf informed Feller that she had two other loans besides the home mortgage that needed to be taken care of. Feller claims that she disputed whether the two other loans belonged to her, but felt unable to talk with Hopfauf about it due to the FBI\u2019s involvement. Feller was unable to refinance through the Bank and was also turned down by another financial institution.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-7\">\u00b610 In May 2008, despite her awareness that Becker was under investigation, Feller asked Becker to assist her in refinancing her home mortgage. With Becker\u2019s assistance, Feller obtained a loan from Guild Mortgage, an institution unrelated to the Bank. After helping Feller refinance, Becker allegedly took some of the loan proceeds. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>Feller explained that she allowed Becker to take some of this money because she thought Becker would repay it. The loan from Guild Mortgage was used to pay off Feller\u2019s home mortgage loan at the Bank.</p>\n<p id=\"AFA\">\u00b611 Feller returned to the Bank in late 2008 and spoke with Bank employee Sandy Struck (Struck) about withdrawing the balance of her escrow account. Struck told Feller that Feller should speak with Bank president Bill Fisher (Fisher). Feller chose not follow up with Fisher, later citing the request of the FBI agents that she not discuss any matters related to the investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-3\">\u00b612 In December 2009, Becker was sent to prison after pleading guilty to federal fraud and money laundering charges. Becker admitted to illegally siphoning funds totaling more than $1.6 million over a five-year period. Even after Becker was sent to prison, Feller admits that she did not try to contact Fisher or anyone else at the Bank to secure the return of her escrow account balance.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-4\">\u00b613 On April 20, 2011, Feller filed a complaint against the Bank containing the following seven counts: (1) negligent supervision; (2) actual and constructive fraud; (3) wrongful conversion; (4) intentional and/or negligent infliction of emotional distress; (5) deceit; (6) breach of contract and the covenant of good faith and fair dealing; and (7) negligent misrepresentation. Feller alleged that she was \u201cseverely traumatized\u201d by the actions of Becker and the Bank. Specifically, she claims that her financial standing and credit reputation were damaged, and she suffered extreme physical and emotional distress.</p>\n<p id=\"ATl\">\u00b614 On May 13, 2011, the Bank sent a check to Feller for $582.13, which represented the $449.40 escrow account balance plus ten percent interest. The Bank filed a motion for summary judgment on October 14, 2011. The Bank asserted that all claims relating to its obligations to report loans to credit reporting agencies and any claims that Feller\u2019s credit was damaged were preempted by the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA). The Bank also claimed that Feller\u2019s independent cause of action for intentional and negligent infliction of emotional distress could be disposed of through summary judgment because Feller failed to demonstrate that she suffered the requisite level of \u201cserious\u201d or \u201csevere\u201d distress. The Bank argued that Feller\u2019s conversion claim was moot because the money in her escrow account had been returned with interest. Finally, the Bank contended that Feller suffered no damages. Feller filed a cross-motion for partial summary judgment on her conversion claim on December 23, 2011. The District Court held a hearing on the pending motions for summary judgment on January 25, 2012.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>\u00b615 On May 30, 2012, the District Court issued its order granting the Bank\u2019s motion for summary judgment and denying Feller\u2019s motion for partial summary judgment. First, the District Court determined that Feller\u2019s state law causes of action were preempted by the FCRA. Next, the District Court concluded that summary judgment was appropriate on Feller\u2019s stand-alone emotional distress claims because Feller failed to provide sufficient evidence that she actually experienced serious or severe emotional distress. Lastly, the District Court denied Feller\u2019s motion for summary judgment and entered summary judgment for the Bank on Feller\u2019s conversion claim because Feller failed to establish the element of unauthorized control. Feller appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-4\">STANDARDS OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">\u00b616 We review a district court\u2019s ruling on a motion for summary judgment de novo, applying the same criteria of M. R. Civ. P. 56 as the district court. <em>Steichen v. Talcott Props., LLC, </em>2013 MT 2, \u00b6 7, 368 Mont. 169, 292 P.3d 458; <em>Dubiel v. Mont. DOT, </em>2012 MT 35, \u00b6 10, 364 Mont. 175,272 P.3d 66. Summary judgment \u201cshould be rendered if the pleadings, the discovery and disclosure materials on file, and any affidavits show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d M. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b470-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b470-7\">\u00b617 <em>Did the District Court err by granting summary judgment to the Bank based on preemption by the federal Fair Credit Reporting </em>Act?</p>\n<p id=\"A_q\">\u00b618 The FCRA, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681 et seq., establishes standards for the collection, communication, and use of consumer information for business purposes. <em>Roybal v. Equifax, </em>405 F. Supp. 2d 1177, 1181 (E.D. Cal. 2005). The stated purpose of the FCRA is to \u201crequire that consumer reporting agencies adopt reasonable procedures\u201d to ensure the accuracy and fairness of credit reporting. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681; <em>see also Curtis v. Citibank, </em>2011 MT 247, \u00b6 8, 362 Mont. 211, 261 P.3d 1059.</p>\n<p id=\"ALu\">\u00b619 The FCRA contains two provisions that function to preempt state law causes of action. The first, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681h(e), reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ArE\">[N]o consumer may bring any action or proceeding in the nature of defamation, invasion of privacy, or negligence with respect to the reporting of information against any consumer reporting agency, any user of information, or any person who furnishes information to a consumer reporting agency, based on information disclosed pursuant to section 609, 610, or 615 [15 USCS \u00a7 1681g, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>1681h, or 1681m], or based on information disclosed by a user of a consumer report to or for a consumer against whom the user has taken adverse action, based in whole or in part on the report, except as to false information furnished with malice or willful intent to injure such consumer.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b471-3\">The second preemption provision, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681t(b)(l)(F), provides that \u201cNo requirement or prohibition may be imposed under the laws of any State ... with respect to any subject matter regulated under ... [15 USCS \u00a7 1681s-2], relating to the responsibilities of persons who furnish information to consumer reporting agencies....\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681t(b)(l)(F). Section 1681s-2 addresses the responsibilities of those who furnish information in the ordinary course of business to consumer reporting agencies. The FCRA requires that furnishers of information provide accurate information and take action when notified of a dispute. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681s-2. The Bank focused its preemption argument on \u00a7 1681t(b)(l)(F).</p>\n<p id=\"b471-4\">\u00b620 Feller complains that because the Bank released credit information relating to her loans with the Bank-including the two loans she initially claimed as hers but later denied having taken-her credit was damaged and she was unable to secure additional loans. The Bank argued that all of Feller\u2019s claims relating to the Bank\u2019s obligations to accurately report loan information to credit reporting agencies and those claims based on an alleged injury to her credit were preempted by \u00a7 1681t(b)(l)(F). The Bank primarily relied on <em>Roybal v. Equifax, </em>405 F. Supp. 2d 1177 (E.D. Cal. 2005). The Roybals brought state and federal claims against various furnishers of credit information and credit reporting agencies after discovering that their credit report contained inaccurate information. <em>Roybal, </em>405 F. Supp. 2d at 1178-79. The court reasoned that \u201c[o]n its face, the FCRA precludes all state statutory or common law causes of action that would impose any \u2018requirement or prohibition\u2019 on the furnishers of credit.\u201d <em>Roybal, </em>405 F. Supp. 2d at 1181. Since the Roybals\u2019 state claims were based on alleged injury arising purely from the reporting of credit information by a furnisher of credit, the court held that the Roybals\u2019 state claims were preempted in their entirety. <em>Roybal, </em>405 F. Supp. 2d at 1181-82. The Bank also pointed to other similar federal court decisions. <em>See e.g. Riley v. GMAC, </em>226 F. Supp. 2d 1316, 1322 (S.D. Ala. 2002); <em>Hasvold v. First USA Bank, N.A., </em>194 F. Supp. 2d 1228, 1239 (D. Wyo. 2002); <em>Jaramillo v. Experian Info. Solutions, Inc., </em>155 F. Supp. 2d 356, 361-62 (E.D. Pa. 2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">\u00b621 Feller countered that her claims were not preempted by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>FCRA. Feller referred to two cases for the proposition that Montana should follow California\u2019s example by not allowing the FCRA to frustrate private remedies. The first case cited by Feller, <em>Cisneros v. U.D. Registry, Inc., </em>39 Cal. App. 4th 548, 46 Cal. Rptr. 2d 233 (Cal. App. 1995), was decided prior to the enactment of \u00a7 1681t(b)(l)(F) in 1996. The second case cited by Feller, <em>Nelson v. Chase Manhattan Mortg. Corp., </em>282 F.3d 1057 (9th Cir. 2002), once again does not address preemption pursuant to \u00a7 1681t(b)(l)(F). Feller conceded that any independent claims brought under the FCRA would be preempted, but maintained that her state law claims were not preempted.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-4\">\u00b622 Feller\u2019s complaint contained the following seven claims: (1) negligent supervision; (2) actual and constructive fraud; (3) wrongful conversion; (4) intentional and/or negligent infliction of emotional distress; (5) deceit; (6) breach of contract and the covenant of good faith and fair dealing; and (7) negligent misrepresentation. Feller attached her credit report to her complaint and alleged that it contained incorrect information about several loans and accounts. Feller alleged that the Bank was subject to the responsibilities of fair and accurate credit reporting as set forth in the FCRA, and she also claimed she was entitled to attorney fees under the FCRA. In granting summary judgment to the Bank, the District Court determined that the FCRA preempted all of Feller\u2019s claims except for her conversion claim and her independent cause of action for emotional distress.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">\u00b623  After reviewing Feller\u2019s complaint, we agree with the District Court. Feller\u2019s claims of negligent supervision, fraud, deceit, breach of contract and the covenant of good faith and fair dealing, and negligent misrepresentation, all stem from her contention that the Bank failed to accurately report information to credit reporting agencies and that as a result, Feller\u2019s credit was damaged. All of the damages alleged under these claims are directly related to Feller\u2019s credit reputation and related repercussions. Such allegations stemming from the Bank\u2019s duties as a furnisher of credit information to accurately report information and take action when notified of a dispute are preempted by the FCRA. Feller fails to cite any authority to the contrary. To allow these state common law claims to proceed would ignore the plain language of \u00a7 1681t(b)(l)(F), which precludes all state statutory or common law causes of action that impose any requirement or prohibition on furnishers of credit.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-6\">\u00b624 Accordingly, we hold that the District Court did not err in granting summary judgment to the Bank on the foregoing claims, based on preemption by the FCRA.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>\u00b625 <em>Did the District Court err in denying Feller\u2019s motion for partial summary judgment and granting the Bank\u2019s motion for summary judgment on Feller\u2019s conversion claim?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b473-3\">\u00b626 A plaintiff alleging a claim of conversion must establish the following four elements: (1) property ownership by the plaintiff; (2) plaintiffs right of possession of the property; (3) defendant\u2019s unauthorized control over the property; and (4) damages. <em>St. Peter &amp; Warren, P.C. v. Purdom, </em>2006 MT 172, \u00b6 19, 333 Mont. 9, 140 P.3d 478 (citing <em>King v. Zimmerman, </em>266 Mont. 54, 60, 878 P.2d 895, 899 (1994)). Conversion is \u201ca distinct act of dominion wrongfully exerted over one\u2019s property in denial of, or inconsistent with, the owner\u2019s right <em>....\u2019\u2019 Bird v. Hiller, </em>270 Mont. 467, 472, 892 P.2d 931, 934 (1995) (citing <em>Gebhardt v. D.A. Davidson &amp; Co., </em>203 Mont. 384, 389, 661 P.2d 855, 858 (1983)).</p>\n<p id=\"b473-4\">\u00b627 The District Court determined that Feller failed to establish that the Bank exercised unauthorized control over her escrow account funds. Feller argues that she requested the return of her escrow account funds in late 2008 and the Bank refused to return her money. Feller also asserts that when the Bank issued her a check for the amount of the escrow account plus interest, the Bank admitted it had wrongfully converted her funds. The Bank counters that Feller never followed through in requesting her escrow account balance, and as soon as she filed suit against the Bank and it became aware that she was requesting the funds at issue, the Bank immediately issued a check for her escrow account balance that included ten percent interest. The Bank further maintains that even if Feller could establish unauthorized control, she is unable to show that she suffered any damages as a result of the conversion.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">\u00b628 Feller\u2019s deposition testimony demonstrates that she failed to establish the element of unauthorized control. Feller testified as follows in her deposition:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b473-6\">Q. (By Mr. Charles, attorney for the Bank) You and Sandy [Struck] talked the end of 2008 about the escrow balance. That\u2019s 400 some dollars?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b473-7\">A. (By Feller) Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b473-8\">Q. That was involved in this lawsuit. Right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b473-9\">A. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b473-10\">Q. All right. And she said, \u201cYou will have to talk to Bill Fisher.\u201d You didn\u2019t want to talk to Bill Fisher because the FBI agents said, \u201cDon\u2019t talk about the case.\u201d Am I right on that? You have to answer out loud.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>A. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-4\">Q. But at some point you apparently came to the judgment that you were no longer bound by the FBI agents telling you not to talk about this and felt free you could talk about the fact that the FBI agents had interviewed you, I assume.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-5\">A. I didn\u2019t feel that until probably after she [Becker] went to prison.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-6\">Q. I\u2019m understanding that was December 15, 2009.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-7\">A. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-8\">Q. All right. Did you, on December 15 or December 16, 2009, or any time after that, go back and talk to Bill Fisher about the escrow balance?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-9\">A. No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-10\">Q. Did you talk to anybody at the bank?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-11\">A. No, sir.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b474-12\">The undisputed facts in the record demonstrate that Feller made no attempt to obtain the funds in her escrow account before filing suit against the Bank. Feller initially asked a Bank employee about the escrow balance, but when she was referred to the proper person at the Bank who could return her money to her, she chose not to pursue her inquiry any further. As such, the record does not show that the Bank\u2019s dominion over Feller\u2019s funds was \u201cunauthorized\u201d or in any way deprived her of her right to retrieve these amounts.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-13\">\u00b629 Further, even if Feller could establish that the Bank exercised unauthorized control over her escrow account funds, she has failed to demonstrate that she suffered any damages as a result of the alleged conversion. Section 27-1-320, MCA, provides that the damages for a conversion claim include \u201cthe value of the property at the time of conversion with the interest from that time ....\u201d It is undisputed that the Bank returned Feller\u2019s full escrow account balance and included ten percent interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-14\">\u00b630 Despite having received the full amount of the disputed sum plus interest, Feller claims that summary judgment is inappropriate because she suffered emotional distress from the alleged conversion and is also entitled to punitive damages. However, our review of Feller\u2019s deposition testimony, pleadings, and evidence establishes that none of Feller\u2019s alleged emotional distress stems from her cause of action for conversion. Feller claims that the interview with the FBI agents caused her emotional distress and she was worried that people would suspect that she was somehow involved in Becker\u2019s illegal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>activities. Feller was also worried about her credit and how it would affect her overall financial situation. Feller failed to assert at any time before the District Court that the alleged conversion of $449.40 was the cause of her emotional distress.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-3\">\u00b631  Because Feller has failed to establish that she incurred damages as a result of the Bank\u2019s ostensible conversion, she cannot state a claim for punitive damages arising from that claim. It is axiomatic that one cannot recover punitive damages in a cause of action unless she first recovers compensatory damages. <em>Jacobsen v. Allstate Ins. Co., </em>2009 MT 248, \u00b6 67, 351 Mont. 464, 215 P.3d 649; <em>Stipe v. First Interstate Bank-Polson, </em>2008 MT 239, \u00b6 23, 344 Mont. 435, 188 P.3d 1063. Therefore, we decline to address the punitive claim further.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-4\">\u00b632  Since Feller failed to establish that the Bank exercised unauthorized control over her property and failed to demonstrate that she suffered any damages, we hold that the District Court did not err in granting summary judgment to the Bank on Feller\u2019s conversion claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-5\">\u00b633 <em>Did the District Court err in dismissing Feller\u2019s emotional distress claims?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b475-6\">\u00b634 Under Montana law, a plaintiffs independent or \u201cstand alone\u201d claim for intentional or negligent infliction of emotional distress can be maintained only upon a showing that the plaintiff suffered \u201cserious\u201d or \u201csevere\u201d emotional distress as the reasonably foreseeable consequence of the defendant\u2019s act or omission. <em>Sacco v. High Country Indep. Press, </em>271 Mont. 209, 237, 896 P.2d 411, 428 (1995). To constitute \u201cserious\u201d or \u201csevere,\u201d the emotional distress must be \u201cso severe no reasonable person could be expected to endure it.\u201d <em>Sacco, </em>271 Mont, at 234, 896 P.2d at 426. In <em>Sacco, </em>we explained this requirement in further detail:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-7\">Emotional distress passes under various names, such as mental suffering, mental anguish, mental or nervous shock, or the like. It includes all highly unpleasant mental reactions, such as fright, horror, grief, shame, humiliation, embarrassment, anger, chagrin, disappointment, worry, and nausea. It is only where it is extreme that the liability arises. Complete emotional tranquillity is seldom attainable in this world, and some degree of transient and trivial emotional distress is a part of the price of living among people. The law intervenes only where the distress inflicted is so severe that no reasonable [person] could be expected to endure it. The intensity and the duration of the distress are factors to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>considered in determining its severity. Severe distress must be proved....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-4\">The distress must be reasonable and justified under the circumstances, and there is no liability where the plaintiff has suffered exaggerated and unreasonable emotional distress, unless it results from a peculiar susceptibility to such distress of which the actor had knowledge.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b476-5\"><em>Sacco, </em>271 Mont, at 234, 896 P.2d at 426 (quoting <em>Restatement (Second) of Torts </em>\u00a7 46 cmt. j (1965)). The requirement that the emotional distress be serious or severe was imposed to alleviate concerns of opening the floodgates to numerous and perhaps even fraudulent claims. <em>Sacco, </em>271 Mont, at 237, 896 P.2d at 428.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-6\">\u00b635 This Court further clarified the serious or severe requirement discussed in <em>Sacco in Henricksen v. State, </em>2004 MT 20, \u00b6 79, 319 Mont. 307, 84 P.3d 38. We explained that \u201c[i]n cases where there is a physical manifestation of bodily harm resulting from emotional distress, such as PTSD, this bodily harm is sufficient evidence that the emotional distress suffered by the plaintiff is genuine and severe.\u201d <em>Henricksen, </em>\u00b6 79. Relying on the <em>Restatement (Second) of Torts </em>\u00a7 46 cmt. k, the Court reiterated that \u201cnormally, severe emotional distress is accompanied or followed by shock, illness, or other bodily harm, which in itself affords evidence that the distress is genuine and severe.\u201d <em>Henricksen, </em>\u00b6 79.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-7\">\u00b636 In <em>Renville v. Fredrickson, </em>2004 MT 324, 324 Mont. 86, 101 P.3d 773, we examined a mother\u2019s negligent infliction of emotional distress claim to determine whether her emotional distress was serious or severe enough to be compensable. Renville\u2019s claims arose from an automobile accident in which her adult son was killed. <em>Renville, </em>\u00b6 4. Renville did not witness the accident, but when she was informed of what had happened, she \u201cbegan to scream and cry and her body shook.\u201d <em>Renville, </em>\u00b6 14. The Court took note of the following factors in determining that Renville had not presented sufficient evidence to establish that the distress caused by her son\u2019s death was so severe that no reasonable person should be expected to endure it: there was no indication of any physical manifestation of grief; no counseling was sought or recommended; she chose not to take antidepressants; her use of medication did not dramatically increase; she did not have continuous nights of sleeplessness or days without appetite; and she maintained close relationships with family and friends. <em>Renville, </em>\u00b6 15. While the Court recognized that she suffered a traumatic loss, it affirmed the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment after <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>concluding that the evidence presented did not demonstrate severe, compensable emotional distress. Renville, \u00b6\u00b6 15-16.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-3\">\u00b637 The intensity and duration of the distress are important factors in evaluating whether the alleged emotional distress is truly serious and severe. <em>Czajkowski v. Meyers, </em>2007 MT 292, \u00b6 36, 339 Mont. 503, 172 P.3d 94. In <em>Czajkowski, </em>we determined that the Meyers had adequately established a compensable independent claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress after their neighbors subjected them to \u201can unrelenting barrage of obscene gestures, vile verbal abuse in which the Czajkowskis employed the coarsest and most offensive words in our language, and on-going surveillance of their every outdoor activity for over four years.\u201d <em>Czajkowski, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 36-37. This was in contrast to <em>Renville, </em>where the source of distress was a single painful event that would begin to heal with time. <em>Czajkowski, </em>\u00b6 36. Even though the Meyers did not seek medical or psychological care, Virginia Meyers \u201cwould cry, her hands would shake, she lost weight, and gave up sleeping,\u201d and Nick Meyers felt extremely angry, apprehensive, embarrassed, and was always looking over his shoulder. <em>Czajkowski, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 34-38.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-4\">\u00b638 In her briefing before the District Court, Feller contended that \u201cit is likely that plaintiff will see a forensic psychologist to provide expert testimony and an opinion that her grievous, great, severe emotional distress passes muster\u201d under <em>Sacco. </em>The Bank countered that it would be improper to allow an expert to provide a legal conclusion on whether her emotional distress was sufficiently severe pursuant to <em>Sacco, </em>and F eller cannot defeat summary judgment by predicting what future evidence she may be able to produce. The District Court determined that Feller could not maintain an independent claim for intentional or negligent infliction of emotion distress because she could not show that her distress was \u201cserious\u201d or \u201csevere\u201d as required by <em>Sacco </em>and its progeny. We agree with the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-5\">\u00b639 Feller testified in her deposition that she was scared after being interviewed by the FBI, she was worried about her financial situation and what others would think of her, she experienced headaches, her sleep was interrupted, the stress caused tightness in her shoulders, and she took herbal remedies for anxiety. Feller further explained in an answer to an interrogatory that she agonized over her credit reputation, she had anxiety attacks, severe headaches, shoulder pain, bathroom difficulties, sleeplessness, overeating from stress, and she needed activities like computer games to take her mind off of the bank issues. However, she offers no evidence to buttress her claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>\u00b640 Feller offers speculation that at some point in the future she might be able to produce some type of evidence to establish that her intentional and negligent infliction of emotional distress claims are compensable and that her emotional distress was sufficiently severe. A party responding to a motion for summary judgment must present \u201csubstantial evidence,\u201d and cannot defeat summary judgment by simply reciting conclusory, unsupported, or speculative statements. <em>See Ternes v. State Farm Fire &amp; Cas. Co., </em>2011 MT 156, \u00b6 27, 361 Mont. 129, 257 P.3d 352; <em>Abraham v. Nelson, </em>2002 MT 94, \u00b6 26, 309 Mont. 366, 46 P.3d 628. \u201cIt is for the court to determine whether on the evidence severe [serious] emotional distress can be found; it is for the jury to determine whether, on the evidence, it has in fact existed.\u201d <em>Renville, </em>\u00b6 16 (quoting <em>Sacco, </em>271 Mont, at 233, 896 P.2d at 425). Feller has failed to produce substantial evidence tending to show that her emotional distress was so severe that no reasonable person could be expected to endure it. Pursuant to <em>Sacco </em>and <em>Renville, </em>it is for the Court to determine whether on the evidence severe emotional distress can be found.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-4\">\u00b641  We conclude that the District Court did not err in granting summary judgment to the Bank on Feller\u2019s intentional and negligent infliction of emotional distress claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b478-6\">\u00b642 For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the District Court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of the Bank.</p>\n<judges id=\"b478-7\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES RICE, McKINNON and BAKER concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
