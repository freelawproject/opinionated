We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-4\">\u00b62 J.S.W. raises two issues on appeal which we have restated as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b35-5\">\u00b63 1. Whether this Court should apply the plain error doctrine to review J. S. W.\u2019s claim that her constitutional rights have been violated.</p>\n<p id=\"Ai\">\u00b64 2. Whether J.S.W. was denied the effective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-6\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"A9\">\u00b65 J.S.W. voluntarily admitted herself to the Behavioral Health Unit (BHU) at St. Peter\u2019s Hospital in Helena, Montana, on March 2, 2012, after law enforcement officers brought her to the hospital for a mental health assessment following a disturbance. After six days of voluntary commitment, J.S.W. requested that she be discharged. However, the Lewis and Clark County Attorney\u2019s Office filed a petition with the District Court requesting that J.S.W. be committed for further evaluation and treatment. The petition alleged that J.S.W. had a mental disorder making her incapable of caring for herself or of managing her own affairs, thus she required commitment.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-7\">\u00b66 That same day, J.S.W. appeared before the District Court. The court advised J.S.W. of her rights, appointed a \u201cfriend of respondent\u201d as specified in \u00a7 53-21-122(2)(b), MCA, and appointed the Office of Public Defender to represent her. The court set a hearing on the petition for commitment for the following day.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-8\">\u00b67 The State\u2019s only witness at the hearing was Susan Hemion, a psychiatric nurse practitioner with the BHU at St. Peter\u2019s Hospital. At the time of the hearing, it was as yet undetermined from which mental disorder J.S.W. was suffering. Hemion testified that the two working diagnoses for J.S.W. were \u201cmood disorder not otherwise specified\u201d and \u201cdementia.\u201d According to Hemion, J.S.W. was experiencing \u201chyper verbal behavior, hyper irritability... racing thoughts, [and] tangential thinking.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b35-9\">\u00b68 Hemion also testified that J.S.W. had difficulty sleeping while at the BHU and that she appeared agitated. In addition, Hemion testified to a number of behaviors exhibited by J.S.W. while at the BHU which concerned Hemion, including J.S.W. spitting out her medication, and invading the space of other patients. Hemion stated that during a recent examination, J.S.W. forgot what she was talking about, could not stay on topic to answer questions, and could not keep her train of thought longer than a few moments. Hemion concluded that J.S.W. was \u201ctoo disorganized to be able to do her daily activities safely,\u201d and that she was \u201ca danger to herself and others.\u201d Thus, Hemion requested <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>that the District Court commit J.S.W. to the Montana State Hospital for <em>\u201ca </em>thorough evaluation\u201d and that she be involuntarily medicated. \u00b69 After Hemion testified, the following exchange occurred between J.S.W.\u2019s counsel and the District Court Judge:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b36-4\">[J.S.W.\u2019s counsel]: Your Honor, I think [J.S.W.] would like to address the Court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b36-5\">THE COURT: For three minutes, and no more than three minutes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b36-6\">J.S.W.\u2019s counsel did not object to this time restriction. J.S.W. addressed the court under the examination of counsel. J.S.W. was also cross-examined by the State\u2019s counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-7\">\u00b610 At the conclusion of the hearing, the District Court determined that J.S.W. suffered from a mental disorder that required treatment. The court also determined that \u201cthe least restrictive, most appropriate alternative\u201d was the Montana State Hospital in Warm Springs. Consequently, the court committed J.S.W. to the Montana State Hospital for a period not to exceed 90 days with a treatment order that included the involuntary administration of medication. J.S.W. appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b36-9\">\u00b611 As a preliminary matter, we note here, as we have done in numerous other cases, that an appeal from an order of involuntary commitment is not moot even if the individual has been released, since the issues raised would fall \u201cunder the \u2018capable of repetition, yet evading review\u2019 exception to the mootness doctrine.\u201d <em>In re D.K.D. </em>,2011 MT 74, \u00b6 14, 360 Mont. 76, 250 P.3d 856 (citing <em>In re D.M.S., </em>2009 MT 41, \u00b6 10, 349 Mont. 257, 203 P.3d 776; <em>In re Mental Health of D.V., </em>2007 MT 351, \u00b6\u00b6 30-32, 340 Mont. 319, 174 P.3d 503; <em>Matter of N.B., </em>190 Mont. 319, 322-23, 620 P.2d 1228, 1231 (1980)).</p>\n<p id=\"b36-10\">Issue 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-11\">\u00b612 <em>Whether this Court should apply the plain error doctrine to review J.S.W/s claim that her constitutional rights have been violated.</em></p>\n<p id=\"Am\">\u00b613 J.S.W. argues that the District Court violated her right to testify on her own behalf when the court imposed an arbitrary time restriction on her testimony. Because J.S.W.\u2019s counsel did not object to the court\u2019s time limitation at trial, J.S.W. argues that we should review this alleged error under the doctrine of plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-13\">\u00b614 The State argues on the other hand that plain error review is not warranted here because there was no error. The State contends that although the court initially indicated that J.S.W.\u2019s testimony would be limited to three minutes, in actuality the court did not hold her to that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>three minutes and did not prevent her from testifying. The State maintains that the District Court properly exercised its discretion regarding the court\u2019s control over the mode and order of interrogating witnesses and presenting evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-4\">\u00b615 Although we generally will not review issues raised for the first time on appeal, we have determined that if a constitutional or substantial right is at issue, we may review such a claim under the plain error doctrine. <em>State v. Gunderson, </em>2010 MT 166, \u00b6 99, 357 Mont. 142, 237 P.3d 74 (citing <em>State v. Longfellow, </em>2008 MT 343, \u00b6 19, 346 Mont. 286, 194 P.3d 694). We invoke plain error review \u201c \u2018where failing to review the claimed error may result in a manifest miscarriage of justice, may leave unsettled the question of the fundamental fairness of the trial or proceedings, or may compromise the integrity of the judicial process.\u2019 \u201d <em>Gunderson, </em>\u00b6 99 (quoting <em>State v. Taylor, </em>2010 MT 94, \u00b6 12, 356 Mont. 167, 231 P.3d 79).</p>\n<p id=\"b37-5\">\u00b616 When an individual raises the plain error doctrine to request review of issues that were not objected to at the district court level, our review is discretionary. <em>Gunderson, </em>\u00b699 (citingState v. <em>Gray, </em>2004 MT 347, \u00b6 13, 324 Mont. 334, 102 P.3d 1255; <em>State v. Daniels, </em>2003 MT 247, \u00b6 20, 317 Mont. 331, 77 P.3d 224). Furthermore, we have repeatedly stated that we will use plain error review sparingly on a case-by-case basis. <em>Gunderson, </em>\u00b6 99 (citing <em>State v. Hayden, </em>2008 MT 274, \u00b6 17, 345 Mont. 252, 1090 P.3d 1091; <em>State v. Rosling, </em>2008 MT 62, \u00b6 77, 342 Mont. 1, 180 P.3d 1102).</p>\n<p id=\"b37-6\">\u00b617 The plain error doctrine establishes a two-part test with the burden on the criminal defendant, or in this case, the person facing involuntary commitment,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> to meet both parts of that test. <em>Gunderson, </em>\u00b6 100 (citing <em>State v. Whipple, </em>2001 MT 16, \u00b6 32, 304 Mont. 118, 19 P.3d 228). Under this test, we ask two questions: (1) does the alleged error implicate a fundamental right; and (2) would failure to review the alleged error result in one of the three consequences mentioned above. <em>Gunderson, </em>\u00b6 100. \u201c[A] mere assertion that constitutional rights are implicated or that failure to review the claimed error may result in a manifest miscarriage of justice is insufficient to implicate the plain error doctrine.\u201d <em>Gunderson, </em>\u00b6 100; <em>see also State v. Mitchell, </em>2012 MT 227, \u00b6 10, 366 Mont. 379, 286 P.3d 1196.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-7\">\u00b618 In the case <em>sub judice, </em>J.S.W. has identified a constitutional right <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>that is applicable to these sorts of proceedings. The Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Article II, Section 25 of the Montana Constitution guarantee an individual the right against self-incrimination. A necessary corollary to the right against self-incrimination is the right to testify in one\u2019s own behalf. <em>Rock v. Arkansas, </em>483 U.S. 44, 52, 107 S. Ct. 2704, 2709 (1987). \u201c \u2018Every criminal defendant is privileged to testify in his own defense, or to refuse to do so.\u2019 \u201d <em>Rock, </em>483 U.S. at 53, 107 S. Ct. at 2710 (quoting <em>Harris v. New York, </em>401 U.S. 222, 225, 91 S. Ct. 643, 645 (1971)).</p>\n<p id=\"b38-4\">\u00b619 In addition, the Fourteenth Amendment secures the right of a criminal defendant to choose between silence and testifying in his own behalf. <em>Rock, </em>483 U.S. at 51, 107 S. Ct. at 2708-09 (\u201cThe right to testify on one\u2019s own behalf at a criminal trial has sources in several provisions of the Constitution. It is one of the rights that \u2018are essential to due process of law in a fair adversary process.\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Faretta v. California, </em>422 U.S. 806, 819 n. 15, 95 S. Ct. 2525, 2533 n. 15 (1975)). \u00b620 Thus, while the State is correct that a district court does have discretion to manage courtroom proceedings, a court must do so mindful of a party\u2019s constitutional rights. <em>See e.g. State v. Couture, </em>2010 MT 201, \u00b6 78, 357 Mont. 398, 240 P.3d 987; <em>State v. Garcia, </em>2003 MT 211, \u00b6\u00b6 32-33, 317 Mont. 73, 75 P.3d 313.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-5\">\u00b621 Nevertheless, in the instant case, while J.S.W.\u2019s claim does implicate her fundamental right to testify, thereby meeting the first prong of the test for plain error review, she has failed to establish any factual basis for her contention that her right to testify was violated. While we do not condone the District Court\u2019s statement that J.S.W. was limited to three minutes, the record reflects that the court did not cut J.S.W. off and her counsel appeared to have sufficient time to develop the line of questioning he felt best served his client. Moreover, the Judge encouraged additional questioning by J.S.W.\u2019s counsel, and also allowed the State to question J.S.W. The transcript clearly reflects this:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b38-6\">[J.S.W.\u2019s counsel]: Your Honor, I think [J.S.W.] would like to address the Court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b38-7\">THE COURT: <em>For three minutes, and no more than three minutes. </em>[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b38-8\">J.S.W.\u2019s counsel then proceeded to question J.S.W. for a short time after which the following transpired:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b38-9\">[J.S.W.\u2019s counsel]: I guess I have no further questions, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b38-10\">THE COURT: Okay. Anything?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b39-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>[The State\u2019s counsel]: Could I ask a couple of questions?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b39-4\">THE COURT: Sure.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b39-5\">The State then asked J.S.W. a few questions at the end of which the following occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b39-6\">[The State\u2019s counsel]: I don\u2019t have any further questions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b39-7\">THE COURT: Okay. Anything else?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b39-8\">[J.S.W.\u2019s counsel]: That\u2019s it, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b39-9\">\u00b622 J.S.W. has failed to persuade this Court that there is any error to review, let alone that a failure to review would result in a manifest miscarriage of justice, leave unsettled the question of the fundamental fairness of the trial or proceedings, or compromise the integrity of the judicial process. In contrast, <em>see e.g. State v. West, </em>2008 MT 338, \u00b6 30, 346 Mont. 244, 194 P.3d 683 (concluding that the factual circumstances identified by West constituted \u201ca quintessential example of \u2018where failing to review the claimed error at issue ... may compromise the integrity of the judicial process\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b39-10\">\u00b623 To the extent J.S.W.\u2019s theory on appeal is that the District Court\u2019s statement imposing a three-minute limitation is itself a due process violation, without regard to what actually transpired on the record subsequent to the court\u2019s statement, J.S.W. has not cited any legal authority supporting this as a constitutional violation. As we indicated above, \u201ca mere assertion that constitutional rights are implicated or that failure to review the claimed error may result in a manifest miscarriage of justice is insufficient to implicate the plain error doctrine.\u201d <em>Gunderson, </em>\u00b6 100.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-11\">\u00b624  Because J.S.W. has failed to meet both prongs of the test for plain error review, we hold that plain error review of this issue is not warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-12\">Issue 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-13\">\u00b625 <em>Whether J.S.W. was denied the effective assistance of counsel.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b39-14\">\u00b626 J.S.W. argues that she was denied the effective assistance of counsel when her counsel failed to object to the District Court\u2019s imposition of a time restriction on J.S.W.\u2019s testimony. Claims of ineffective assistance of counsel are mixed questions of law and fact which this Court reviews de novo. <em>State v. Miner, </em>2012 MT 20, \u00b6 10, 364 Mont. 1, 271 P.3d 56 (citing <em>Gunderson, </em>\u00b6 66; <em>Whitlow v. State, </em>2008 MT 140, \u00b6 9, 343 Mont. 90, 183 P.3d 861).</p>\n<p id=\"b39-15\">\u00b627 In her brief on appeal, J.S.W. relies on <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 104 S. Ct. 2052 (1984), the traditional test for evaluating ineffective assistance of counsel claims, to evaluate her claim. This Court has determined, however, that <em>Strickland </em>is inappropriate to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>evaluate involuntary civil commitment proceedings because <em>Strickland </em>fails to adequately protect the liberty interests of the person facing involuntary commitment. <em>In re T.J.F., </em>2011 MT 28, \u00b6 33, 359 Mont. 213, 248 P.3d 804 <em>(citingIn re C.R.C., </em>2009 MT 125, \u00b6 16, 350 Mont. 211, 207 P.3d 289).</p>\n<p id=\"b40-4\">\u00b628 Instead, the proper role of an attorney in involuntary commitment proceedings is \u201cto represent the perspective of the respondent and to serve as a vigorous advocate for the respondent\u2019s wishes.\u201d T.J.F., \u00b6 33 (citing <em>C.R.C., </em>\u00b6 18). To that end, we look to the following five \u201ccritical areas\u201d to measure effective assistance of counsel in these types of proceedings: (1) appointment of counsel; (2) counsel\u2019s initial investigation; (3) counsel\u2019s interview with the patient-respondent; (4) the patient-respondent\u2019s right to remain silent; and (5) counsel\u2019s role as an advocate for the patient-respondent. <em>T.J.F., </em>\u00b6 33.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-5\">\u00b629 We will consider the entire record and evaluate each factor \u201cbased on the facts and circumstances of the entire case.\u201d <em>In re C.R., </em>2012 MT 258, \u00b6 28, 367 Mont. 1, 289 P.3d 125 (quoting <em>C.R.C., </em>\u00b6 19). We will vacate an order of involuntary commitment upon a substantial showing of evidence that counsel did not effectively represent the patient-respondent\u2019s interests pursuant to the foregoing standards. <em>C.R., </em>\u00b6 28 (citing C.R.C., \u00b6 16; <em>In re Mental Health of K.G.F., </em>2001 MT 140, \u00b6 91, 306 Mont. 1, 29 P.3d 485).</p>\n<p id=\"b40-6\">\u00b630 In the instant case, J.S.W.\u2019s claim implicates only the fourth and fifth factors-J.S.W.\u2019s right to remain silent (or, in this case, her right to testify), and counsel\u2019s role as an advocate for J.S.W. Neither J.S.W.\u2019s briefs nor the record as a whole indicate any insufficiency regarding the first three factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-7\">\u00b631  Based upon our review of the record, we conclude that J.S.W. has failed to make a \u201csubstantial showing of evidence that counsel did not effectively represent [J.S.W.\u2019s] interests.\u201d <em>C.R., </em>\u00b6 28. In his cross-examination of Hemion, the State\u2019s witness who was advocating for J.S.W.\u2019s commitment to the Montana State Hospital, counsel effectively elicited that Hemion had no first-hand knowledge of J.S.W.\u2019s driving, or J.S.W.\u2019s abilities in daily tasks such as cooking and cleaning. In addition, under counsel\u2019s cross-examination, Hemion conceded that J.S.W. had secured her own food and lodging in Helena, and that J.S.W. had voluntarily checked herself into the BHU. Hemion also conceded under cross-examination that J.S.W. did not display any physical danger to others during her time in the BHU, nor did she demonstrate any level of self harm. Moreover, while Hemion had testified to J.S.W.\u2019s disorganized thought processes, in his direct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>examination of J.S.W., counsel was able to keep J.S.W. focused.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-4\">\u00b632 J.S.W.\u2019s allegation of error on counsel\u2019s part was counsel\u2019s failure to object to the court\u2019s statement that J.S.W.\u2019s testimony would be restricted to three minutes. However, as we indicated in the previous issue, J.S.W. testified under both direct and cross-examination, thus the court did not actually restrict her testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-5\">\u00b633 Additionally, in the final few pages of her opening brief on appeal, J.S.W. notes that the following exchange took place after the District Court pronounced judgment:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b41-6\">[J.S.W.]: Your Honor, I have something to say. May I say it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b41-7\">THE COURT: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b41-8\">[J.S.W.]: May my attorney assist me?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b41-9\">(Discussion off the record.)</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b41-10\">[J.S.W.]: Ma\u2019am,-</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b41-11\">THE COURT: We are done.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b41-12\">[J.S.W.]: I would like to request that instead of going to Warm Springs that you send me to three months in St. Peter\u2019s Hospital, the behavior mod unit, because-</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b41-13\">THE COURT: You talk that over with your lawyer.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b41-14\">(End of proceedings.)</p>\n<p id=\"b41-15\">Although J.S.W. includes this excerpt from the record at the end of her issue regarding ineffective assistance of counsel, J.S.W. does not indicate just how counsel was ineffective here. Instead, J.S.W. returns to her contentions from the first issue that the District Court erred in limiting her testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-16\">\u00b634 Nevertheless, the court had already indicated, based on the testimony presented, that the least restrictive, most appropriate placement for J.S.W. was at Warm Springs State Hospital. Moreover, even though J.S.W. expressed her wish to be committed to the BHU at St. Peter\u2019s Hospital, the reason the State filed its petition for involuntary commitment for J.S.W. in the first place was because J.S.W. requested to be discharged from that facility.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-17\">\u00b635 We conclude that the record as a whole demonstrates that J.S.W.\u2019s counsel served as <em>\u201ca </em>vigorous advocate\u201d for J.S.W.\u2019s wishes. <em>T.J.F., </em>\u00b6 33. Consequently, we hold that J.S.W. was not denied the effective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-18\">\u00b636 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b41-19\">JUSTICES BARER, COTTER, WHEAT and MORRIS concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b37-8\"> An individual facing involuntary commitment has all of the rights guaranteed by both the United States Constitution and the Montana Constitution.
