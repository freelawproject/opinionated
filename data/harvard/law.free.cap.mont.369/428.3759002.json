Buslayev maintains that the District Court improperly admitted into evidence five photos of the victim\u2019s body. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-6\">PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b451-7\">\u00b62 On December 17, 2008, Jerry Parrick, a volunteer with the West End Volunteer Fire Department, responded to a call regarding an overturned vehicle at McGee Point on westbound 1-90, at mile marker 17 between Haugen and DeBorgia in Mineral County, Montana. Parrick responded in his firefighter uniform and in his personal pickup. Parrick\u2019s pickup was equipped with emergency lighting. As rescue workers began their efforts to extricate a family from an overturned vehicle, Parrick moved his vehicle to a position that would establish a safety zone to alert oncoming traffic of the hazard and to provide an area for rescue personnel to work. At the time of the emergency, snow was falling, the Interstate was snow packed and slippery, and the temperature was five degrees.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-8\">\u00b63 Parrick was inside his pickup, facing west, and parked on the shoulder of 1-90 to warn oncoming traffic of the accident. Buslayev, who was operating a commercial tractor trailer, approached Parrick\u2019s vehicle and began merging into the left lane. Buslayev downshifted and used the brake which caused the tractor trailer to jackknife and hit Parrick\u2019s pickup. The force of the collision pushed the cargo area of the pickup into the cab killing Parrick.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-9\">\u00b64 An Information was filed on June 9,2010, charging Buslayev with negligent homicide and criminal endangerment. Prior to trial, the parties entered into the following stipulation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b451-10\">The parties hereby stipulate that Jerry Parrick died as a result of injuries sustained when his vehicle was struck by a tractor-trailer driven by the Defendant on December 17,2008. You should consider this fact to be proven; no other proof is required.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b451-11\">\u00b65 Buslayev filed a Motion in Limine requesting that five photos of the victim\u2019s body, State\u2019s Exhibits 1-5, 1-6, 1-7, 1-8, and 1-10, be excluded from evidence at trial. The photos depicted the victim\u2019s body in his firefighter gear and how the victim was positioned within the cab of his pickup following impact. The victim\u2019s face was covered with a cloth. Although Buslayev admits the photographs were not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>particularly gruesome or gory, he argues that the photos were highly prejudicial in that they depicted death and showed the victim in his firefighter gear. Buslayev maintains that the photos had no probative value because they could not establish the speed of Buslayev\u2019s truck and, in light of the parties\u2019 stipulation, were not probative of any issue the jury must decide.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-4\">\u00b66 The State argues that the photos were relevant to demonstrate that the victim\u2019s position within the cab was due to Buslayev\u2019s excessive speed. The State also maintains that the position of the victim\u2019s body tended to show severe impact and excessive speed which rendered Buslayev\u2019s statements to law enforcement that he was traveling at a slower speed incredible and not worthy of belief.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">\u00b67 Both the State and Buslayev produced expert witnesses in crash reconstruction. A primary consideration for the jury was whether Buslayev was traveling at an excessive rate of speed given the conditions of the roadway. The District Court noted that the photos helped explain how the accident happened and that they were not \u201cunduly sensational.\u201d The court granted Buslayev\u2019s request as to one photo which depicted the victim\u2019s face, but allowed the State to use the remaining photos which depicted the victim with a cloth over his head. \u00b68 The sole issue on appeal is whether the District Court erred when it admitted the photos of the victim into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b452-7\">\u00b69 A district court\u2019s decision regarding the admissibility of evidence will not be reversed absent an abuse of discretion. <em>State v. Montgomery, </em>2005 MT 120, \u00b6 7, 327 Mont. 138, 112 P.3d 1014 (citing <em>State v. Snell, </em>2004 MT 334, \u00b6 17, 324 Mont. 173, 103 P.3d 503). In considering the admissibility of photographs, a district court must determine whether the probative value of the photos outweighs any prejudicial effect. <em>State v. Dunfee, </em>2005 MT 147, \u00b6 26, 327 Mont. 335, 114 P.3d 217 (citing M. R. Evid. 403; <em>State v. Henry, </em>241 Mont. 524, 531, 788 P.2d 316, 320 (1990)). \u201cThis Court has consistently held that photographs possessing instructive value are relevant and admissible provided their probative value is not substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.\u201d <em>Dunfee, </em>\u00b6 26 (citing <em>State v. Close, </em>267 Mont. 44, 47-48, 881 P.2d 1312, 1314 (1994)). \u201cThe test for abuse of discretion is whether the trial court acted arbitrarily or exceeded the bounds of reason resulting in substantial injustice.\u201d <em>State v. English, </em>2006 MT 177, \u00b6 50, 333 Mont. 23, 140 P.3d. 454 (quoting <em>State v. Kearney, </em>2005 MT 171, \u00b6 12, 327 Mont. 485, 115 P.3d 214).</p>\n<p id=\"b453-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b453-4\">\u00b610 The jury had to decide if Buslayev committed the criminal offense of negligent homicide. A person commits the offense of negligent homicide \u201cif the person negligently causes the death of another human being.\u201d Section 45-5-104(1), MCA. Section 45.-2-101(43), MCA, defines the mental state of \u201cnegligently\u201d as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-5\">when the person consciously disregards a risk that the result will occur or that the circumstance exists or when the person disregards a risk of which the person should be aware that the result will occur or that the circumstance exists. The risk must be of a nature and degree that to disregard it involves a gross deviation from the standard of conduct that a reasonable person would observe in the actor\u2019s situation. \u201cGross deviation\u201d means a deviation that is considerably greater than the lack of ordinary care.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b453-6\">\u00b6 11 Evidence having any tendency to make the existenceofa fact that is of consequence to an action more probable or less probable is relevant evidence. M. R. Evid. 401. Further, all relevant evidence is generally admissible. M. R. Evid. 402. A trial judge, faced with the potential admission of relevant but prejudicial evidence, is required, pursuant to M. R. Evid. 403, to determine whether the probative value of the evidence is substantially outweighed by the danger of \u201cunfair prejudice.\u201d As has been often noted by this Court, probative evidence is frequently prejudicial to the defendant. This does not, however, make it unfairly prejudicial and require its exclusion. <em>State v. Heuther, </em>284 Mont. 259, 265-66, 943 P.2d 1291, 1295 (1997); <em>State v. Bieber, </em>2007 MT 262, \u00b6 59, 339 Mont 309, 170 P.3d 444; <em>State v. Schauf, </em>2009 MT 281, \u00b6 42, 352 Mont. 186, 216 P.3d 740.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-7\">\u00b612  The photos to which Buslayev objects depict the victim\u2019s body and his position within the interior of his cab. They are relevant in not only demonstrating the severity or the strength of the impact, but are additionally relevant in depicting the circumstances which establish Buslayev\u2019s negligent conduct. As the District Court noted, the photos assist in explaining the accident and illustrate what happened. Although Buslayev stipulated that the victim died as a result of injuries sustained when his vehicle was hit by Buslayev\u2019s truck, the photos illustrate not only the impact, but, as specifically noted by the District Court, that the truck jackknifed. The photos thus were probative of Buslayev\u2019s negligence and the manner in which the collision occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-8\">\u00b613 The District Court also considered the prejudicial value of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>photos and determined that they were not \u201cunduly sensational.\u201d The District Court thus correctly balanced the probative value of the photos against their prejudicial effect. Having found the photos not \u201cunduly sensational\u201d and of explanatory or illustrative value, the District Court allowed their admission.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-4\">\u00b614  The balancing of probative value against unfair prejudice is a matter within the discretion of the trial court, and a ruling on the admissibility of photographs will not be disturbed on appeal absent an abuse of discretion. <em>State v. Devlin, </em>251 Mont. 278, 283, 825 P.2d 185, 188 (1991); <em>State v. Austad, </em>197 Mont. 70, 83, 641 P.2d 1373, 1380 (1982). We hold that the District Court properly considered admission of the photos under M. R. Evid. 403 and did not abuse its discretion in admitting them.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">\u00b615 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b454-6\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES WHEAT, MORRIS and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
