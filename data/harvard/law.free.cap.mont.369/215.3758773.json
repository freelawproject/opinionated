The dispositive issue on appeal is whether the District Court erred in dismissing the petition. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-4\">PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">\u00b62 On May 27, 2009, Rukes was arrested and taken to the Missoula County Detention Center based on alleged criminal conduct including the assault of his wife. At the detention center, Officer Stacy Lear did not record her interview with Rukes, but instead took notes which she later converted into a written report to be used in evidence. Rukes filed a motion to suppress his statements from evidence because the interview violated newly-enacted legislation requiring that custodial interrogations be recorded. Sections 46-4-406 through -411, MCA (effective October 1, 2009). On September 24, 2009, the District Court denied his motion to suppress because the statutes were not yet in effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-6\">\u00b63 The District Court set a jury trial for January 6, 2010. Rukes originally retained private counsel, Kathleen Foley and William Boggs, who withdrew from representation shortly before the trial date due to Rukes\u2019s inability to fulfill fee obligations and because they fundamentally disagreed with Rukes about whether he should proceed to trial. Upon their withdrawal, the District Court appointed Christopher Daly to represent Rukes and Rukes chose to continue the trial in order to provide his new attorney with adequate preparation time. Daly represented Rukes in his March 10,2010, jury trial. During the trial, a courtroom officer reportedly sat close enough to Rukes that a juror asked the bailiff who the man was, and the bailiff indicated that he was \u201cMr. Rukes\u2019s guard.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b238-7\">\u00b64 On March 11, 2010, the jury found Rukes guilty of felony Aggravated Assault and misdemeanor Unlawful Restraint. On June 1, 2010, the District Court sentenced Rukes to twenty years in Montana State Prison with ten years suspended on the felony offense and six months in jail on the misdemeanor offense, to be served concurrently. The District Court ordered a mental evaluation of Rukes and that he have no contact with his wife and children.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-8\">\u00b65 On January 19, 2011, Rukes\u2019s appellate counsel filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S. Ct. 1396 (1967) and \u00a7 46-8-132(2), MCA, discussing nine arguable appeal issues: (1) the court erred in denying Rukes\u2019s motion to suppress; (2) the court erred in granting Foley\u2019s and Boggs\u2019s motion to withdraw; (3) the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>abused its discretion in refusing to exclude a witness from the courtroom; (4) the court failed to fully and fairly instruct the jury; (5) Rukes was denied due process as a result of the bailiffs misconduct; (6) Rukes was denied a speedy trial; (7) the court abused its discretion in ordering a mental examination of Rukes; (8) the court violated Rukes\u2019s Fifth Amendment rights by relying on the mental evaluations in sentencing; and (9) Rukes received ineffective assistance of trial counsel. Rukes\u2019s appellate counsel could not identify any meritorious issues and requested permission to withdraw from representation.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-4\">\u00b66 On March 8,2011, this Court entered an order noting that Rukes had failed to file a response to his attorney\u2019s <em>Anders </em>brief and granting appellate counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw. We dismissed Rukes\u2019s appeal, concluding that \u201can appeal in this case would be wholly frivolous.\u201d Rukes thereafter filed a response and we granted his motion requesting consideration of the late response. On March 29,2011, after consideration of Rukes\u2019s response, we upheld our previous order dismissing his appeal and permitting his counsel\u2019s withdrawal.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">\u00b67 Proceeding <em>pro se, </em>Rukes then filed in the District Court a Petition for Post-Conviction Relief, raising twelve issues. The court noted in its February 8, 2012 order that \u201cvirtually all of the Petitioner\u2019s claims are nothing more than his personal argument and speculation\u201d and that most of Rukes\u2019s arguments had been addressed on direct appeal. The District Court nonetheless discussed the merits of Rukes\u2019s claims. In addressing Rukes\u2019s claims of ineffective assistance of counsel, the court ordered Foley and Boggs to respond by affidavit to Rukes\u2019s allegation that they had failed to provide him with a copy of a proposed plea agreement, failed to explain the plea agreement and failed to explain consequences of proceeding to trial. The court ordered Daly to respond by affidavit to Rukes\u2019s claim that he failed to move for a new trial after the bailiff allegedly committed misconduct. Having reviewed the attorneys\u2019 affidavits, the court determined that Rukes\u2019s petition did not demonstrate \u201cany kind of error, cumulative or otherwise,\u201d and dismissed the petition. Rukes appealed <em>pro se </em>to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b239-7\">\u00b68 We review the district court\u2019s denial of a petition for postconviction relief to determine whether its findings of fact are clearly erroneous and whether its legal conclusions are correct. <em>Miller v. State, </em>2012 MT 131, \u00b6 9, 365 Mont. 264, 280 P.3d 272. Grounds for relief \u201cthat were or could reasonably have been raised on direct appeal may not be raised, considered or decided in a proceeding\u201d for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>postconviction relief. Section 46-21-105(2), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-4\">\u00b69 Ineffective assistance of counsel claims present mixed questions of law and fact that we review de novo. <em>Miller, </em>\u00b6 9. To prevail on such a claim, the petitioner must demonstrate that \u201ccounsel\u2019s performance was deficient\u201d and that \u201cthe deficient performance prejudiced the defense.\u201d <em>Whitlow v. State, </em>2008 MT 140, \u00b6 10, 343 Mont. 90, 183 P.3d 861 (quoting <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 687 (1984)). We apply the same standard when reviewing claims of ineffective assistance of appellate counsel. <em>Rogers v. State, </em>2011 MT 105, \u00b6 37, 360 Mont. 334, 253, P.3d 889.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b240-6\">\u00b610 Rukes argues that the District Court erred in dismissing his Petition for Post-Conviction Relief on the following grounds: (1) the District Court erred in denying his motion to suppress his statements from evidence; (2) Rukes was denied a speedy trial; (3) Daly provided ineffective assistance of counsel; (4) Foley and Boggs provided ineffective assistance of counsel; (5) the court erred in granting Foie/s and Boggs\u2019s motion to withdraw; and (6) counsels\u2019 cumulative errors warrant reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-7\">\u00b611 We agree with the State that, with the exception of several of Rukes\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claims, most of Rukes\u2019s claims are barred from appellate review under \u00a7 46-21-105(2), MCA, because they were or could have been raised on direct appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-8\">\u00b612 <em>1. Denial of Rukes\u2019s motion to suppress.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b240-9\">\u00b613 Rukes argues that the District Court erred in denying his motion to suppress the statements he made during his May 2009 interview because the interview was not recorded, in violation of \u00a7\u00a7 46-4-406 through -411, MCA. He also argues that the court should have compelled Officer Lear to produce her original handwritten notes. Rukes\u2019s appellate counsel raised these issues in her <em>Anders </em>brief and, after independent examination of the record and consideration of Rukes\u2019s arguments, we agreed that they were without merit. As noted, the statutes require recordation of custodial interrogations, but became effective in October 2009, several months after Rukes\u2019s interview. We will not consider the issue again in reviewing the District Court\u2019s denial of Rukes\u2019s Petition for Post-Conviction Relief. Section 46-21-105(2), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-10\">\u00b614 <em>2. Whether Rukes was denied a speedy trial.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b240-11\">\u00b615 Similarly, we will not consider Rukes\u2019s argument that he was denied the right to a speedy trial. Appellate counsel raised that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>question in her <em>Anders </em>brief and suggested it was frivolous, based in part on the following exchange during pre-trial proceedings:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-4\">THE DEFENDANT: Your Honor, I feel it\u2019s more important to have good representation than to have a speedy trial. I feel that-I don\u2019t care if it\u2019s two or three months down the road, whatever it takes to prepare....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-5\">THE COURT: You\u2019ve said enough. If you are willing right now, with your eyes wide open and understand what\u2019s going on, that you have a right to a speedy trial but you\u2019re willing to waive it because of circumstances in this case-</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ap-\">THE DEFENDANT: Yeah.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b241-6\">\u00b616 On direct appeal, we reviewed the record and agreed with appellate counsel that the issue lacked merit; we decline to reconsider it. Section 46-21-105(2), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-7\">\u00b617 <em>3. Ineffective assistance of trial counsel.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b241-8\">\u00b618 Rukes alleges that Daly provided ineffective assistance of counsel because he improperly portrayed Rukes during his opening statement as \u201ca drunken wife abuser,\u201d failed to move for a new trial based on the bailiffs misconduct, failed to counsel Rukes regarding his right against self-incrimination, failed to object during sentencing to court-ordered mental evaluations, and failed to object to an improper condition of Rukes\u2019s sentence-namely, a condition prohibiting Rukes from contacting his two daughters who were not involved in the incident that gave rise to Rukes\u2019s convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-9\">\u00b619 The District Court rejected the claim that Rukes\u2019s attorney made a prejudicial comment during opening statement. Rukes failed to point out a specific comment and, searching the record, the court concluded that the alleged statement was \u201ca figment of the Petitioner\u2019s imagination].\u201d The court also recognized that an improper opening statement \u201cwould be record-based and should have been raised on direct appeal[.]\u201d We agree. <em>See State v. Howard, </em>2011 MT 246, \u00b6 21, 362 Mont. 196, 265 P.3d 606 (\u201cWhen claims of ineffective assistance are capable of resolution by examining the record alone, they are appropriate for consideration on direct appeal.\u201d). Furthermore, the trial transcript indicates only that Daly stated Rukes \u201chad been drinking.\u201d Rukes has not explained how this statement prejudiced the outcome of his trial or rendered Daly\u2019s performance \u201cdeficient.\u201d <em>Whitlow, </em>\u00b6 10. His contention that appellate counsel provided ineffective assistance of counsel based on her failure to raise this issue lacks merit for the same reasons. <em>Heddings v. State, </em>2011 MT 228, \u00b6 33, 362 Mont. 90, 265 P.3d 600 (counsel is not ineffective for failing to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>\u201cmake motions or objections which, under the circumstances, would have been frivolous\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b242-4\">\u00b620 We turn to Rukes\u2019s claim that Daly was ineffective for failing to file a motion for a new trial following the bailiffs alleged misconduct. Appellate counsel suggested in her <em>Anders </em>brief that the bailiffs communication with the jurors did not constitute reversible error because Rukes could not demonstrate prejudicial consequences. <em>State v. Baugh, </em>174 Mont. 456, 465, 571 P.2d 779, 784 (1977). We agreed that the record did not demonstrate any prejudice resulting from the bailiffs misconduct. As a consequence, Daly\u2019s failure to move for a new trial on that basis also is without merit. <em>See Porter v. State, </em>2002 MT 319, \u00b6 32, 313 Mont. 149, 60 P.3d 951 (defendant failed to \u201cestablish any prejudice as a result of the momentary observation of him in handcuffs by prospective jurors\u201d and thus counsel\u2019s failure to move for a mistrial was not deficient).</p>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">\u00b621  Each of Rukes\u2019s other arguments regarding Daly\u2019s alleged ineffectiveness was discussed in appellate counsel\u2019s <em>Anders </em>brief and considered by this Court in dismissing his direct appeal. Appellate counsel noted that, to prevail on his ineffective assistance of counsel claims, a defendant generally must demonstrate that the reasons for counsel\u2019s actions appear in the record, or that there is no plausible justification for counsel\u2019s actions. <em>State v. Kougl, </em>2004 MT 243, \u00b6\u00b6 14, 21, 323 Mont. 6, 97 P.3d 1095. Since the record in this case did not reflect counsel\u2019s reasons for failing to object to the involuntary mental evaluations or the sentencing condition, appellate counsel suggested that the ineffective assistance claims were unsubstantiated. We agreed. In this postconviction proceeding, Rukes offers nothing to substantiate his allegations that Daly\u2019s performance was deficient or that, absent such deficiency, the result of the proceeding would have been different. <em>See Ellenburg v. Chase, </em>2004 MT 66, \u00b6 16, 320 Mont. 315, 87 P.3d 473 (\u201c[A] petition for postconviction relief must be based on more than mere conclusory allegations.\u201d). He has not met his burden of showing reversible error by the District Court in denying his petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-6\">\u00b622 <em>4. Ineffective assistance of counsel during pre-trial proceedings.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b242-7\">\u00b623 Rukes argues that Foley and Boggs provided ineffective assistance due to their failure to pursue a speedy trial, failure to provide Rukes with a copy of the State\u2019s proposed plea agreement, and failure to advise him of the consequences of rejecting the plea agreement. As noted, we addressed the speedy trial issue on direct appeal. In ruling <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>on Rukes\u2019s petition for postconviction relief, the District Court determined that \u201cPetitioner\u2019s own actions belie the viability of this claim which clearly cannot be sustained as a matter of fact.\u201d The court dismissed the claim for failure to state a claim for relief under \u00a7 46-21-201(l)(a), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-4\">\u00b624 The court pointed out that on April 11,2010, Rukes wrote a letter to the court, indicating that he refused the plea bargain due to his distrust of the prosecutor. The letter stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-5\">[I] was offered a plea bargain of 5 or 10 years suspended by Suzy Boylan. It was enticing but I took information acquired from other attorneys; informing me of Suzy\u2019s \u201cdemon pursuits linked to careerism who is acting like the zelots [sic].\u201d One attorney went so far as to say \u201cSuzy is so unreasonable that she needs mental intervention.\u201d I was also informed that any judge in Missoula is more reasonable than her.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b243-6\">\u00b625 Foley and Boggs stated in their affidavit that even when Rukes\u2019s bill was in arrears and their motion to withdraw was pending, they worked for free on \u201cboth trial preparation and negotiations to settle the case on terms favorable to Rukes.\u201d They stated that they \u201cspent hours discussing the pros and cons of going to trial with Rukes, and advised him in no uncertain terms (although he did not want to hear it) that he would very likely end up in prison for a significant period if he went to trial.\u201d Foley and Boggs attest that they went through significant effort to secure a plea offer that \u201cwould have saved Rukes had he not reneged on it.\u201d They stated that upon receiving the plea agreement from the prosecutor on December 28, 2009, they \u201cbrought the Agreement to Rukes to sign. Instead he asked to keep it overnight, so we left it with him.\u201d Rukes initially had indicated to Foley and Boggs that he would accept the plea agreement, but changed his mind. Attached as an exhibit to Foley\u2019s and Boggs\u2019s affidavit was an email from Foley to prosecutor Boylan stating as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-7\">I brought the Plea Agreement that Jack had accepted out to review with him yesterday and spent a couple hours in discussion and answering all his questions. He wanted to keep it over night. When I went back this morning to see him and retrieve the documents, he had changed his mind.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b243-8\">\u00b626 The affidavit and supporting documents provide further support for the District Court\u2019s conclusion that Rukes\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claim was without merit. Rukes had the burden of establishing his claim through material facts; his unsupported allegations do not suffice to demonstrate that Foley and Boggs failed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>to provide him with a copy of the plea agreement or to advise him of the consequences of proceeding to trial. <em>Ellenburg, </em>\u00b6 16. The District Court did not err in dismissing the claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-4\">\u00b627 <em>5. Withdrawal of Foley and Boggs from representation.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">\u00b628 We addressed on direct appeal Rukes\u2019s contention that the District Court erred in granting Foley\u2019s and Boggs\u2019s motion to withdraw from representation. Foley and Boggs moved to withdraw due to Rukes\u2019s inability to pay his fee obligations and because a fundamental disagreement between counsel and Rukes arose from his refusal to accept the plea agreement. The District Court considered their motion during its December 29, 2009, hearing. His appellate counsel could find no authority to support a conclusion that the District Court abused its discretion in granting the motion to withdraw, unless counsels\u2019 withdrawal violated Rukes\u2019s speedy trial right. We already have addressed that question in \u00b6\u00b6 14-16, above.</p>\n<p id=\"ARE\">\u00b629 <em>6. Whether counsels\u2019 cumulative errors warrant reversal.</em></p>\n<p id=\"A-l\">\u00b630  The doctrine of cumulative error \u201cis appropriate to reverse a defendant\u2019s conviction only where a number of errors, taken together, prejudiced the defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial.\u201d <em>Howard, </em>\u00b6 40 (quoting <em>State v. Ferguson, </em>2005 MT 343, \u00b6 126, 330 Mont. 103, 126 P.3d 463) (internal quotation marks omitted). We have considered all of the arguments Rukes has made on appeal. For the reasons already discussed, we agree with the District Court that Rukes has not met his burden of establishing that any error of his pre-trial and trial counsel prejudiced his right to a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">\u00b631 We affirm the District Court\u2019s dismissal of Rukes\u2019s Petition for Post-Conviction Relief.</p>\n<judges id=\"b244-7\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES COTTER, MORRIS and McKINNON concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
