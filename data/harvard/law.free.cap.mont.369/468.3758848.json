As part of his sentence, the Seventh Judicial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>District Court, Dawson County, ordered Jent to pay $44,112.74 in restitution, including $19,866.69 for Cadorette\u2019s medical expenses arising from her suicide attempt two and a half months after Jent\u2019s assault. Jent appeals only that portion of his sentence involving the $19,866.69 in restitution. He claims that Cadorette, in respect to her suicide attempt, cannot be considered a \u201cvictim\u201d of his offense for restitution purposes, and that there was no causal connection between his criminal conduct and the medical expenses associated with the suicide attempt. We affirm the District Court\u2019s order of restitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-4\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">\u00b62 Jent and Cadorette, husband and wife, have what can be characterized as a tumultuous and often violent relationship. On October 27, 2011, Jent and Cadorette got into a drunken argument. Jent struck Cadorette in the face, fracturing the orbital wall of her right eye socket. Cadorette was initially treated at Glendive Medical Center and subsequently underwent surgery in Billings. Jent also damaged Cadorette\u2019s vehicle, television, and computer.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-6\">\u00b63 On November 18, 2011, the State charged Jent with aggravated assault and two counts of felony criminal mischief. On January 13, 2012, Jent pleaded guilty to aggravated assault pursuant to a plea agreement which recommended a sentence of eight years to the Department of Corrections, with six years suspended, and various conditions, including restitution. Jent agreed to pay restitution for Cadorette\u2019s medical bills in an amount to be determined prior to sentencing. The State moved to dismiss the criminal mischief counts.</p>\n<p id=\"Aui\">\u00b64 On the same day that Jent pleaded guilty, Cadorette ingested a bottle of Ambien and two bottles of Crown Royal whiskey. This occurred two days after Cadorette\u2019s January 11,2012 meeting with the prosecutor and defense counsel where the criminal proceedings against Jent were discussed. As a result of her suicide attempt, Cadorette spent the next several days in a behavioral health unit and accumulated medical expenses totaling $19,866.69.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-7\">\u00b65 A probation/parole officer prepared a presentence investigation report (PSI) for sentencing. The Restitution section of the PSI identifies $19,866.69 as \u201cthe costs associated with [Cadorette\u2019s] medical care due to her mental health issues occurring after the instant offense.\u201d Cadorette also prepared an Affidavit of Victim\u2019s Pecuniary Loss, which the District Court admitted into evidence over Jent\u2019s objection. In addition to other amounts claimed as restitution, which are not at issue in this appeal, the affidavit included the $19,866.69 in medical expenses related to her suicide attempt.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>\u00b66 In the Victim\u2019s Impact section of the PSI, the probation/parole officer notes that she spoke with Cadorette on March 5, 2012. Cadorette told the officer that she had attempted suicide on two separate occasions since Jent\u2019s offense, the most recent on January 13. Cadorette stated that she had attempted suicide \u201cbecause she felt guilty about what happened and was blaming herself for the instant offense.\u201d Cadorette also stated that she felt Jent\u2019s plea agreement with the State was \u201charsh\u201d and that he \u201cjust needs anger treatment.\u201d The probation/parole officer reiterated these facts during her testimony at Jent\u2019s sentencing hearing. She testified that at their March 5 meeting, Cadorette \u201cvoiced a lot of guilty feelings, feelings that she was somehow at fault for this.\u201d Cadorette \u201cblamed herself a lot in the instant offense.\u201d Jent did not refute the officer\u2019s testimony in this regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-4\">\u00b67 Cadorette also testified at the sentencing hearing. She explained that her relationship with Jent was \u201cpretty rocky\u201d and often violent, and that two of Jent\u2019s prior offenses involved assaults against her. She admitted responsibility for participating in some of the marital disputes. Regarding the instant offense, Cadorette testified that she had not asked Jent to pay her medical expenses arising out of her January 13, 2012 suicide attempt. Nevertheless, she agreed that her suicide attempt was \u201cdirectly related\u201d to Jent\u2019s assault against her eleven weeks earlier, and that her meeting with the prosecutor and defense counsel on January 11 had \u201cdrudged up\u201d her memories of the assault. Cadorette further testified that her therapist had reached the conclusion that Cadorette\u2019s suicide attempt was \u201cdirectly correlated\u201d to the assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">\u00b68 The District Court sentenced Jent to eight years at the Department of Corrections, with three years suspended. The court ordered Jent to pay $44,112.74 in restitution, including $19,866.69 for Cadorette\u2019s medical expenses related to her suicide attempt. Jent now appeals the imposition of the $19,866.69 in restitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-6\">STANDARDS OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b492-7\">\u00b69 Pursuant to \u00a7 46-18-201(5), MCA, if a person has been found guilty of an offense, whether by a verdict of guilty or by a plea of guilty or nolo contendere, and the sentencing judge finds that a \u201cvictim\u201d has sustained a \u201cpecuniary loss,\u201d as defined in \u00a7 46-18-243, MCA, then the sentencing judge shall, as part of the sentence, require payment of full restitution to the victim, as provided in \u00a7\u00a7 46-18-241 through -249, MCA. Such analysis requires the sentencing judge to apply the statutory definitions of \u201cvictim\u201d and \u201cpecuniary loss\u201d to the factual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>circumstances of the case. This constitutes a mixed question of law and fact. <em>State v. Warclub, </em>2005 MT 149, \u00b6 21, 327 Mont. 352, 114 P.3d 254 (\u201cmixed questions of law and fact are those in which the historical facts are admitted or established, the rule of law is undisputed, and the issue is whether the facts satisfy the statutory standard\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b493-4\">\u00b610 In reviewing such questions on appeal, the sentencing court\u2019s factual findings will not be disturbed unless they are clearly erroneous, but whether those facts satisfy the legal standard is reviewed de novo. <em>Warclub, </em>\u00b6 23; <em>State v. Weaver, </em>2008 MT 86, \u00b6 10, 342 Mont. 196, 179 P.3d 534. A finding of fact is clearly erroneous if it is not supported by substantial evidence, if the district court has misapprehended the effect of the evidence, or if a review of the record leaves this Court with a definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been made. <em>State v. Breeding, </em>2008 MT 162, \u00b6 11, 343 Mont. 323, 184 P.3d 313. Substantial evidence is evidence that a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion; it consists of more than a mere scintilla of evidence, but may be somewhat less than a preponderance. <em>Johnston v. Palmer, </em>2007 MT 99, \u00b6 26, 337 Mont. 101, 158 P.3d 998.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">\u00b611 <em>Did the District Court err by requiring Jent to pay restitution for medical expenses arising from Cadorette\u2019s suicide attempt?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b493-7\">\u00b612 As noted, when a criminal defendant pleads guilty to an offense, the sentencing court must impose restitution if the offender\u2019s criminal conduct resulted in pecuniary loss to a victim. Section 46-18-201(5), MCA. The restitution must be \u201cfull\u201d and to \u201cany victim who has sustained pecuniary loss, including a person suffering an economic loss.\u201d Section 46-18-241(1), MCA. Restitution engrafts a civil remedy onto a criminal statute, creating a procedural shortcut for crime victims who would be entitled to a civil recovery against the offender. <em>State v. Brownback, </em>2010 MT 96, \u00b6 19, 356 Mont. 190, 232 P.3d 385. This Court has determined that restitution is not to be limited by the definition of the offense or to only those injuries arising as a \u201cdirect\u201d result of the offense. <em>See State v. LaTray, </em>2000 MT 262, \u00b6\u00b6 12-14, 302 Mont. 11, 11 P.3d 116. The plain language of the restitution statutes \u201cdoes not limit restitution to victims defined in terms of the offense for which the defendant was convicted or to losses arising directly from the defendant\u2019s criminal conduct.\u201d <em>LaTray, </em>\u00b6 12; <em>see also State v. Ness, </em>2009 MT 300, \u00b6 20, 352 Mont. 317, 216 P.3d 773.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-8\">\u00b613 The victim, for purposes of restitution, may be any person who <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>suffers loss of property, bodily injury, or death \u201cas a result of\u2019 the offender\u2019s criminal conduct, and may also include a governmental entity that suffers loss of property \u201cas a result of\u2019 the commission of the offense. Section 46-18-243(2)(a)(i), (iii), MCA. Moreover, pecuniary loss includes special damages that a person could recover against the offender in a civil action \u201carising out of\u2019 the offender\u2019s criminal activities. Section 46-18-243(l)(a), MCA. It also includes the full replacement cost of property taken, destroyed, harmed, or otherwise devalued \u201cas a result of\u2019 the offender\u2019s criminal conduct, and future medical expenses that the victim can reasonably be expected to incur \u201cas a result of\u2019 the offender\u2019s criminal conduct. Section 46-18-243(l)(b), (c), MCA. Thus, a causal relation between the offender\u2019s criminal conduct and the pecuniary loss is the touchstone for determining whether a person or entity is a victim entitled to restitution. <em>City of Billings v. Edward, </em>2012 MT 186, \u00b6 26, 366 Mont. 107, 285 P.3d 523; <em>Brownback, </em>\u00b6 20; <em>Breeding, </em>\u00b6 13. Further, a pecuniary loss may be so attenuated as to no longer be considered \u201ca result of\u2019 the offense. <em>Ness, </em>\u00b6 20; <em>LaTray, </em>\u00b6 14; <em>Brownback, </em>\u00b6 20 n. 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-4\">\u00b614 In determining Jent\u2019s restitution obligation for Cadorette\u2019s medical expenses, we must examine the causal relation between his offense of aggravated assault (fracturing the orbital wall of Cadorette\u2019s right eye socket) and Cadorette\u2019s suicide attempt. Jent maintains that Cadorette\u2019s losses were self-inflicted and did not result from his breaking her right orbital socket. Jent thus argues that Cadorette cannot be considered a \u201cvictim\u201d for purposes of determining pecuniary loss. Although Jent does not dispute that Cadorette was a victim of his aggravated assault, he argues that she cannot be considered a victim in relation to her own suicide attempt because any losses she suffered were not \u201cas a result of ... the commission of an offense.\u201d Section 46-18-243(2)(a)(i)(A), MCA. Jent\u2019s analysis of the meaning of \u201cvictim,\u201d however, ignores the consideration of a causal connection between his underlying offense and Cadorette\u2019s suicide attempt. If such connection is established, the losses sustained by Cadorette were \u201cas a result of\u2019 Jent\u2019s offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">\u00b615 This Court previously examined the nature of the causal connection between an injury and a subsequent suicide in the context of a workers\u2019 compensation proceeding. In <em>Campbell v. Young Motor Co., </em>211 Mont. 68, 70-71, 684 P.2d 1101, 1102 (1984), we refused to recognize suicide as an intentional act that automatically breaks the chain of causation to defeat a claim for death benefits. Favorably quoting a case from Delaware, we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-6\">\u201cIn applying this [chain of causation] test, death by suicide would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>be compensable if it is caused by severe pain and despair which proximately results from a compensable accident, and is of such a degree as to override normal and rational judgment. A suicide committed under such circumstances cannot be said to be \u2018intentional\u2019 even though the act itself may be volitional.\u201d <em>[Delaware Tire Center v. Fox, </em>401 A.2d 97, 100 (Del. Super. 1979).] This chain of causation rule recognizes that the injury and the post-injury trauma, mental as well as physical, may take a path anticipated by no one, but nonetheless be traceable to the injury itself.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b495-4\"><em>Campbell, </em>211 Mont. at 72, 684 P.2d at 1103 (first brackets in original, paragraph break omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">\u00b616  Cadorette\u2019s suicide attempt occurred on the same day Jent pleaded guilty, and two days after she had discussed the criminal proceedings against Jent with the prosecutor and defense counsel. Cadorette testified that this discussion \u201cdrudged up\u201d her feelings about the assault. She felt guilty about what had happened, was blaming herself for Jent\u2019s offense, and felt responsible for the harsh penalty she believed Jent was receiving. Given the relatively short timespan of eleven weeks between Jent\u2019s criminal conduct and Cadorette\u2019s subsequent suicide attempt, it appears that the deterioration in her mental health was related to the events in Jent\u2019s criminal proceedings, the nature of the particular offense, and the dynamics of the parties\u2019 marital relationship. Most importantly, in response to questioning by the sentencing judge, Cadorette testified that the suicide attempt was \u201cdirectly related\u201d to Jent\u2019s assault upon her. The record supports the District Court\u2019s determination that a causal connection exists between Jent\u2019s offense and Cadorette\u2019s suicide-related medical expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-6\">\u00b617 This conclusion is consistent with our prior decisions regarding an offender\u2019s restitution obligation and an asserted attenuated loss. In <em>State v. Grindheim, </em>2004 MT 311, \u00b6\u00b6 55-56, 323 Mont. 519, 101 P.3d 267, we affirmed the district court\u2019s order that the defendant, who had been found guilty of sexual intercourse without consent, pay the victim\u2019s future counseling costs. In <em>State v. Perkins, </em>2009 MT 150, 350 Mont. 387, 208 P.3d 386, we concluded that the childcare costs incurred by P.M. (the child-victim\u2019s aunt) were recoverable as restitution because the behavior of the defendant (Perkins) had caused the child (C.C.) to be removed from the mother\u2019s home and placed in P.M.\u2019s care. We observed that \u201cPerkins\u2019 conduct was the precipitating event in the youth in need of care proceedings that led to removal of C.C. from her mother\u2019s home and placement with P.M.\u201d <em>Perkins, </em>\u00b6 10. In Ness, the defendant tampered with evidence by washing his vehicle <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>following a hit-and-run accident. We determined that his action of striking the victim with his vehicle created the evidence with which he ultimately tampered. Had he not struck the victim, the charge of tampering with the evidence from that incident would not have arisen. <em>Ness, </em>\u00b6 16. The victim died from the injuries she received when Ness\u2019s vehicle struck her, thus incurring funeral expenses. We held that these expenses resulted from Ness\u2019s actions. <em>Ness, </em>\u00b6 21. Lastly, we held in <em>LaTray </em>that towing and ambulance services, which had responded to the scene of the defendant\u2019s offense, were entitled to restitution for their expenses. We observed that \u201cMontana\u2019s restitution statute does not confine restitution to the amount by which a defendant enriches himself at the victim\u2019s expense but[,] rather, empowers courts to impose restitution for economic loss as a result of the crime.\u201d <em>LaTray, </em>\u00b6 21. We specifically held that \u201cLaTray\u2019s criminal acts created a situation in which ambulance and towing services were reasonably necessary for public safety or for the safety of LaTray himself. The expenditures incurred by the ambulance and towing services were a result of LaTray\u2019s crime.\u201d <em>LaTray, </em>\u00b6 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-4\">\u00b618 In the instant proceeding, Cadorette\u2019s suicide attempt is causally related to Jent\u2019s action of fracturing her right orbital socket. There is a definite connection between the underlying aggravated assault and Cadorette\u2019s mental health. This is reflected not only in the parties\u2019 violent and tumultuous marital relationship, which is a factor bearing on the existence of a causal connection in this case, but also in Cadorette\u2019s testimony that her suicide attempt was \u201cdirectly related\u201d to Jent\u2019s assault. Jent\u2019s conduct created a situation which resulted in medical expenses arising from the compromised mental health of his victim. Accordingly, there is a causal connection between Jent\u2019s offense and the restitution requirement for Cadorette\u2019s suicide attempt.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">\u00b619 Jent additionally asserts that there was no \u201cnexus or correlation\u201d between his offense and the restitution requirement. We find this argument to be without merit. The nexus requirement is based on our cases interpreting \u00a7\u00a7 46-18-201(4) and -202(1), MCA. <em>See Ness, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 10-11; <em>City of Bozeman v. Cantu, </em>2013 MT 40, \u00b6 20, 369 Mont. 81, 296 P.3d 461. Given our conclusion that the medical expenses relating to Cadorette\u2019s suicide attempt are causally connected to Jent\u2019s underlying offense of aggravated assault, we have little difficulty in also concluding that there is a nexus between Jent\u2019s offense and his obligation to pay restitution for those medical expenses. <em>Cf. Ness, </em>\u00b6 17 (\u201cRestitution for Sherman\u2019s funeral expenses has \u2018some correlation or connection to the underlying offense\u2019 for which Ness was sentenced.... Thus, there is a nexus or correlation between the crime and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>restitution requirement.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b497-4\">\u00b620 Finally, Jent argues that Cadorette\u2019s medical expenses would not have been recoverable in a civil action against him. He cites \u00a7 46-18-243(l)(a), MCA, which defines \u201cpecuniary loss\u201d as \u201call special damages..., <em>substantiated by evidence in the record, </em>that a person could recover against the offender in a civil action\u201d (emphasis added). He also relies on \u00a7 46-18-244(2), MCA, which states that \u201c[i]n the proceeding for the determination of the amount of restitution, the offender may assert any defense that the offender could raise in a civil action for the loss for which the victim seeks compensation.\u201d Jent contends that there was not any substantial evidence demonstrating that his conduct was the \u201cproximate cause\u201d of Cadorette\u2019s suicide attempt. He also contends that Cadorette had a duty to mitigate her damages by seeking psychological counseling, rather than attempting suicide.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">\u00b621 Jent had the opportunity to assert mitigation in the District Court. He did not do so, and we will not review that question for the first time on appeal. <em>State v. Ferguson, </em>2005 MT 343, \u00b6 38, 330 Mont. 103, 126 P.3d 463. As for Jent\u2019s evidentiary argument, the District Court considered Cadorette\u2019s Affidavit of Victim\u2019s Pecuniary Loss, as permitted by \u00a7 46-18-242, MCA. No evidence was presented that would dispute the accuracy or correctness of the amount of medical expenses set forth in the affidavit. The District Court also considered, and accepted, Cadorette\u2019s testimony that her suicide attempt was directly related to Jent\u2019s instant offense. Given this testimony, as well as Cadorette\u2019s feelings of guilt and self-blame arising out of the incident, the timing of her suicide attempt, and the nature of the parties\u2019 relationship, we simply are not persuaded by Jent\u2019s contention that Cadorette\u2019s desperate act was \u201ctoo far removed\u201d from Jent\u2019s assault to have been (as he puts it) \u201cproximately caused\u201d by the assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-6\">\u00b622  Based on the foregoing discussion, we hold that the District Court did not err in determining that Cadorette\u2019s suicide attempt was \u201ca result of\u2019 Jent\u2019s criminal conduct. We further conclude that substantial evidence in the record supports the restitution obligation. We thus uphold the District Court\u2019s restitution order totaling $44,112.74, which includes $19,866.69 for medical expenses incurred as a result of the suicide attempt.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-7\">\u00b623 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b497-8\">JUSTICES BAKER, COTTER, MORRIS and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
