We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-9\">\u00b62 Ann-Marie and Stanley raise three issues on appeal which we have restated as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b320-10\">\u00b63 1. Whether the custodial parents of a minor child have the right to demand that a law firm of the parents\u2019 choosing represent the claims of the child over the opposition of the guardian <em>ad litem </em>and conservator.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-11\">\u00b64 2. Whether \u00a7\u00a7 37-61-403 and 72-5-427, MCA, are unconstitutional as applied in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-12\">\u00b65 3. Whether \u00a7 37-61-403, MCA, conflicts with the Montana Rules of Professional Conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b321-4\">\u00b66 In July 2007, Ann-Marie and her unborn child, C.K.O., sustained serious injuries in an automobile collision in Lake County, Montana. C.K.O. was delivered that same day by emergency cesarean section. Soon after the accident, Ann-Marie and her husband, Stanley, hired several attorneys, including Greg Ingraham, to represent both Ann-Marie and C.K.O. in their claims for damages resulting from the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">\u00b67 On November 9, 2007, Ann-Marie and Stanley, dissatisfied with the services of their previous attorneys, executed a contingent fee agreement with the law firm of Viscomi &amp; Gersh (Viscomi) to represent both Ann-Marie and C.K.O. in their claims for damages resulting from the accident. On December 11, 2007, Viscomi filed a Petition for Appointment of Guardian Ad Litem and Conservator for C.K.O. with the Lake County District Court. The petition explained that a significant settlement was expected as a result of the serious injuries C.K.O. suffered in the accident, and that a guardian <em>ad litem </em>(GAL) and conservator were necessary to protect and promote C.K.O.\u2019s interests. The petition requested the appointment of Matthew O\u2019Neill to act as GAL and conservator for C.K.O. The petition was signed by Ann-Marie and Stanley as C.KO.\u2019s natural parents.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-6\">\u00b68 Ann-Marie\u2019s case settled in October 2009. A lawsuit for C.K.O. has not yet been filed because it is too early for C.KO.\u2019s doctors to provide an opinion on her medical prognosis that would be sufficient for litigation or settlement purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-7\">\u00b69 In November 2011, Ann-Marie and Stanley retained Morales Law Office (Morales) to investigate and pursue legal action against Ingraham and an individual named Edward Engel. Ingraham and Engel had made personal loans to Ann-Marie and Stanley that allegedly were subject to high interest rates and fees. In 2009, Ingraham and Engel presented invoices to Viscomi for payment of these loans. At Ann-Marie\u2019s request, Viscomi paid the loans out of her settlement funds. In November 2011, Morales filed a complaint for usury against Ingraham and Engel pertaining to these loans.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-8\">\u00b610 On December 7, 2011, Morales sent a letter to Viscomi advising them that, henceforth, Morales would be representing C.K.O. The letter requested C.KO.\u2019s file and a statement for services performed so that payment for C.K.O.\u2019s \u201cformer\u201d attorneys\u2019 work would be honored on a quantum meruit basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-9\">\u00b611 Viscomi responded by letter dated January 6, 2012, refusing to withdraw as counsel and stating that O\u2019Neill, C.K.O.\u2019s GAL and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>conservator, did not believe it was in C.KO.\u2019s best interests to change attorneys. Morales sent a letter in reply stating that it was the prerogative of C.KO.\u2019s parents to choose C.KO.\u2019s counsel. The letter explained that the reason Ann-Marie and Stanley wanted to change counsel was because of their \u201cdisappointment and discomfort\u201d over the loans Viscomi paid out of Ann-Marie\u2019s settlement funds. The letter again requested all original file materials for C.K.O.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-4\">\u00b612 On January 27, 2012, Morales filed a Notice of Substitution of Counsel with the District Court. A few days later, Viscomi sent a letter to Morales stating that, pursuant to \u00a7 75-5-427, MCA, O\u2019Neill had the authority to make decisions as to C.KO.\u2019s counsel, and that, pursuant to \u00a7 37-61-403, MCA, the Notice of Substitution of Counsel was void since it was filed without Viscomi\u2019s consent or a court order. Shortly thereafter, O\u2019Neill filed a report with the District Court stating that it was not in C.KO.\u2019s best interests to change legal counsel at this time. Morales then filed a Motion to Disqualify Counsel challenging O\u2019Neill\u2019s authority and asserting that natural parents retain the right to choose which law firm should represent their minor children, regardless of the parents\u2019 prior consent to the appointment of a GAL and conservator.</p>\n<p id=\"AMD\">\u00b613 The parties briefed their positions, and on May 1, 2012, the District Court issued an Order Denying the Motion to Disqualify Counsel. In its order, the court stated that Morales had no authority to sign any documents on behalf of C.K.O. because Morales failed to comply with \u00a7 37-61-403, MCA, regarding substitution of counsel. The court explained that \u00a7 37-61-403, MCA, provides two means by which a change of attorney may be made: (1) upon the consent of both the attorney of record and the client, or (2) upon an order of the court after an application made by either the attorney of record or the. client, and after notice from one to the other. The court stated that Morales\u2019 motion failed under subsection (1) of the statute \u201cbecause it does not contain the consent of both the attorney [Viscomi] and the client, Matthew O\u2019Neill, Conservator, or of the parents of said minor.\u201d The court also stated that the motion failed under subsection (2) of the statute \u201cbecause no change of attorney was made upon order of the Court and no application was made by either the attorney of record or the client.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b322-5\">\u00b614 Morales subsequently filed a Motion to Reconsider asking the District Court to clarify its order regarding who was considered the client in this case, C.KO\u2019s parents or C.KO.\u2019s GAL and conservator. The motion noted the significant constitutional rights of Ann-Marie and Stanley as C.KO.\u2019s natural parents. The court denied the motion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>pointing out that \u201cthe Montana Rules of Civil Procedure do not contain any authority for a \u2018Motion to Reconsider.\u2019 \u201d Ann-Marie and Stanley appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-4\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">\u00b615 We review a district court\u2019s denial of a motion to disqualify counsel for an abuse of discretion. <em>Krutzfeldt Ranch, LLC v. Pinnacle Bank, </em>2012 MT 15, \u00b6 13, 363 Mont. 366, 272 P.3d 635 (citing <em>Schuff v. A.T. Klemens &amp; Son, </em>2000 MT 357, \u00b6 26, 303 Mont. 274, 16 P.3d 1002).</p>\n<p id=\"Axm\">\u00b616 In addition, our review of constitutional questions is plenary. <em>Alexander v. Bozeman Motors, Inc., </em>2012 MT 301, \u00b6 19, 367 Mont. 401, 291 P.3d 1120 (citing <em>Walters v. Flathead Concrete Products, Inc., </em>2011 MT 45, \u00b6 9, 359 Mont. 346, 249 P.3d 913). The constitutionality of a statute is a question of law, and we review a district court\u2019s legal conclusions for correctness. <em>Alexander, </em>\u00b6 19.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-6\">ISSUE 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-7\">\u00b617 <em>Whether the custodial parents of a minor child have the right to demand that a law firm of the parents\u2019 choosing represent the claims of the child over the opposition of the GAL and conservator.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b323-8\">\u00b618 Ann-Marie and Stanley argue that the District Court erroneously interjected itself into their private affairs thereby hindering their ability to make decisions concerning their child\u2019s best interests. Ann-Marie and Stanley further argue that they have a fundamental right to control and direct litigation on behalf of their minor child, and that the GAL and conservator has no right to usurp their parental authority to discharge counsel for their minor child.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-9\">\u00b619 Viscomi argues on the other hand that Ann-Marie and Stanley do not have a fundamental right to unilaterally choose which law firm should represent their child after they voluntarily consented to the appointment of a GAL and conservator for that child. Instead, once Anne-Marie and Stanley consented to the appointment of the GAL and conservator, they divested themselves of the right to decide what is in their child\u2019s best interests regarding legal representation in the child\u2019s personal injury claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-10\">\u00b620 The United States Supreme Court has recognized that the interest of parents in the care, custody, and control of their children is a well-established fundamental liberty interest under the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s Due Process Clause. <em>Snyder v. Spaulding, </em>2010 MT 151, \u00b6 12, 357 Mont. 34, 235 P.3d 578 (citing <em>Troxel v. Granville, </em>530 U.S. 57, 65, 120 S. Ct. 2054, 2060 (2000)). Similarly, this Court has observed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-4\">[t]he rights to conceive and to raise one\u2019s children have been deemed essential basic civil rights of man, and [r]ights far more precious ... than property rights .... It is cardinal with us that the custody, care and nurture of the child reside first in the parents, whose primary function and freedom include preparation for obligations the state can neither supply nor hinder.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b324-5\"><em>In re J.L.B., </em>182 Mont. 100, 109, 594 P.2d 1127, 1132 (1979) (internal citations and quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b324-7\">\u00b621  Nevertheless, while parents have a fundamental right to parent their children, that right is not absolute, especially if there is a conflict of interest between the parents and the children. <em>See e.g. Kulstad v. Maniaci, </em>2009 MT 326, \u00b6 58, 352 Mont. 513, 220 P.3d 595 (\u201cThe parent\u2019s constitutionally protected interest in the parental control of a child should yield to the best interests of the child 'when the parent\u2019s conduct is contrary to the child-parent relationship.\u2019 Section 40-4-227(2)(b), MCA.\u201d); <em>Williams v. Superior Court, </em>147 Cal. App. 4th 36, 50 (2007) (\u201cif the parent has an actual or potential conflict of interest with his child, the parent has no right to control or influence the child\u2019s litigation.\u201d ... Thus, a parent with a conflict of interest is no longer considered \u201cfit\u201d to make decisions regarding the child\u2019s litigation).</p>\n<p id=\"b324-8\">\u00b622 In the instant case, Ann-Marie and Stanley claim that there is no actual or potential conflict between their interests and C.KO.\u2019s interests, thus they retain the right to decide what is in C.KO.\u2019s best interests. Ann-Marie and Stanley claim that before this right can be taken away from them, they must be shown to be unfit, and no such showing has been made in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-9\">\u00b623  We conclude that there is no need to show that a conflict exists between Ann-Marie\u2019s, Stanley\u2019s and C.KO.\u2019s interests or that Ann-Marie and Stanley are unfit, because Ann-Marie and Stanley voluntarily relinquished their control of the litigation to the GAL and conservator. Moreover, Ann-Marie and Stanley have never petitioned the District Court for removal of the GAL and conservator.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-10\">\u00b624 In <em>Garrick v. Weaver, </em>888 F.2d 687 (10th Cir. 1989), the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit held that once a conservator or GAL has been appointed to represent the interests of a child, the parents lack standing to assert or raise claims on behalf of the child absent express consent or court order. <em>Garrick, </em>888 F.2d at 692 (citing <em>Susan R.M. v. Northeast Independent School Dist., </em>818 F.2d 455, 458 (5th Cir. 1987) (\u201cNothing in the federal rules, however, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>authorizes the parent of a child for whom a legal representative has been appointed to file an action without obtaining court authority to do so.\u201d)).</p>\n<p id=\"b325-4\">\u00b625 In <em>Garrick, </em>two minor children and their mother were seriously injured in an automobile accident, and a guardian <em>ad litem </em>was appointed to represent the children\u2019s interests in the subsequent lawsuit. <em>Garrick, </em>888 F.2d at 690. The court in <em>Garrick </em>relied upon Fed. R. Civ. P. 17(c)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> to hold that once a minor or incompetent has a representative such as a conservator or GAL, the \u201cnext friend\u201d or parents can no longer proceed to pursue a claim on behalf of their child. <em>Garrick, </em>888 F.2d at 693. The court explained that Rule 17(c) flows from the general duty of a court to protect the interests of infants and incompetents in cases before the court. <em>Garrick, </em>888 F.2d at 693 (citing <em>Dacanay v. Mendoza, </em>573 F.2d 1075, 1079 (9th Cir. 1978); Noe <em>v. True, </em>507 F.2d 9, 11-12 (6th Cir. 1974)). \u201cOnce appointed, the [GAL] is \u2018a representative of the court to act for the minor in the cause, <em>with authority to engage counsel, </em>file suit, and to prosecute, control and direct the litigation.\u2019 \u201d <em>Garrick, </em>888 F.2d at 693 <em>(quoting Noe, </em>507 F.2d at 12) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">\u00b626 The court in <em>Garrick </em>further stated that allowing two parties, the court-appointed GAL and the parents, to represent the minor children would interfere with the orderly development of the lawsuit because the minor children could take inconsistent positions through their multiple representatives. <em>Garrick, </em>888 F.2d at 693. The court suggested that to resolve this situation, parents should apply to the court to remove the GAL or to have the court appoint a different GAL to protect the children\u2019s interests. <em>Garrick, </em>888 F.2d at 693.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-6\">\u00b627 Montana\u2019s current rule regarding representation of minors (M. R. Civ. P. 17(c)) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b325-7\">(c) Minor or Incompetent Person.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b325-8\">(1) With a Representative. The following representatives may sue or defend on behalf of a minor or an incompetent person:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b325-9\">(A) a general guardian;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b325-10\">(B) a committee;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b326-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>(C) a conservator; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b326-4\">(D) a like fiduciary.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b326-5\">(2) Without a Representative. A minor or an incompetent person who does not have a duly appointed representative may sue by a next friend or by a guardian ad litem. The court must appoint a guardian ad litem-or issue another appropriate order-to protect a minor or incompetent person who is unrepresented in an action.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b326-6\">Like the federal rule in <em>Garrick, </em>Montana\u2019s rule provides that a conservator may sue or defend on behalf of the minor, and if the minor does not have a conservator or other like fiduciary, the court must appoint a GAL to protect the minor\u2019s interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-7\">\u00b628 Thus, Montana law permits a court to appoint a GAL (\u00a7 25-5-301, MCA), a general guardian (Title 72, chapter 5, part 2, MCA), or a conservator (Title 72, chapter 5, part 4, MCA) to represent the interests of a minor child. Although the natural parents have priority to be appointed as conservator of their minor child\u2019s estate, \u00a7 72-5-410(l)(e), MCA, the parents are also statutorily allowed to nominate someone else to serve in that capacity, \u00a7 72-5-410(2), MCA. In this case, Ann-Marie and Stanley explicitly nominated O\u2019Neill. Moreover, the District Court\u2019s order did not place any limitations on O\u2019Neill\u2019s authority to act in such capacity.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-8\">\u00b629 Nevertheless, Ann-Marie and Stanley claim that the GAL and conservator statutes are intended only to preserve and protect a ward\u2019s assets once the ward receives them. The statutes setting forth the powers and duties of a conservator, however, confer on the conservator far more authority than simply preserving and protecting existing assets. For example, \u00a7 72-5-427, MCA, confers the following powers and duties on a conservator:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b326-9\">(3) A conservator, acting reasonably in efforts to accomplish the purpose for which the conservator was appointed, may act without court authorization or confirmation to:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b326-10\">(w) <em>employ persons, including attorneys, </em>auditors, investment advisors, or agents, even though they are associated with the conservator, to advise or assist the conservator in the performance of administrative duties, act upon their recommendation without independent investigation, and instead of acting personally, <em>employ one or more agents to perform any act of administration, </em>whether or not discretionary;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>(x) <em>prosecute or defend actions, claims, or proceedings </em>in any jurisdiction for the protection of estate assets and of the conservator in the performance of the conservator\u2019s duties .... [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b327-4\">\u00b630 Further, the current position of Ann-Marie and Stanley is contrary to that set forth in their Petition for Appointment of Guardian Ad Litem and Conservator wherein they specifically stated \u201cit is in [C.KO.\u2019s] <em>best interests </em>to have a guardian ad litem and conservator appointed for the purpose of <em>overseeing [C.KO.\u2019s] interests in her claims arising from the... accident\u201d </em>(emphasis added). Additionally, in the Consent and Waiver of Notice section of their petition, Ann-Marie and Stanley represented that they consented \u201cto the appointment of Matthew H. O\u2019Neill as guardian ad litem and conservator of [C.K.O.] <em>in regards to the legal claims she has arising from the ... accident\u2019 </em>(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">\u00b631 Thus, although Ann-Marie and Stanley contend that O\u2019Neill was only appointed to protect C.K.O.\u2019s assets <em>once she receives them, </em>their petition and supporting documents state otherwise. As requested and petitioned by Ann-Marie and Stanley, O\u2019Neill was to oversee C.KO.\u2019s legal claims arising from the accident. This necessarily includes overseeing the litigation itself, including making decisions as to which counsel should represent C.K.O.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">\u00b632  Accordingly, we hold that when Ann-Marie and Stanley consented to the appointment of a GAL and conservator to act in C.KO.\u2019s best interests in \u201cthe legal claims she has arising from the ... accident,\u201d they divested themselves of the right to determine who should represent C.K.O. in her personal injury claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-7\">Issue 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-8\">\u00b633 <em>Whether \u00a7\u00a7 37-61-403 and 72-5-427, MCA, are unconstitutional as applied in this case.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b327-9\">\u00b634 Ann-Marie and Stanley contend that \u00a7\u00a7 37-61-403 and 72-5-427, MCA, as applied by the District Court in this case, unconstitutionally usurp their fundamental parental rights in the care, custody and control of their child. Viscomi argues on the other hand that these statutes are not unconstitutional as applied by the District Court because there is a legitimate governmental interest in making sure that the best interests of the child are considered in the selection of attorneys to represent the child in a personal injury case.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-10\">\u00b635 All legislative enactments are presumed to comply with the Montana Constitution. <em>Disability Rights Montana v. State, </em>2009 MT 100, \u00b6 18, 350 Mont. 101, 207 P.3d 1092 (citing Sean <em>v. State, </em>2008 MT <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>67, \u00b6 12, 342 Mont. 85, 179 P.3d 524). The party challenging a statute\u2019s constitutionality bears the burden of proving the statute unconstitutional beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Walters v. Flathead Concrete Products, </em>Inc., 2011 MT 45, \u00b6 32, 359 Mont. 346, 249 P.3d 913 (citing <em>Satterlee v. Lumberman\u2019s Mut. Cas. Co., </em>2009 MT 368, \u00b6 10, 353 Mont. 265, 222 P.3d 566; <em>Henry v. State Compensation Ins. Fund, </em>1999 MT 126, \u00b6 11, 294 Mont. 449, 982 P.2d 456). Furthermore, we construe statutes narrowly to avoid a finding of unconstitutionality, and we resolve any questions of constitutionality in favor of the statute. <em>Disability Rights Montana, </em>\u00b6 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-4\">\u00b636 Section 37-61-403, MCA, one of the statutes that Ann-Marie and Stanley claim is unconstitutional as applied in this case, provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-5\">Change of attorney. The attorney in an action or special proceeding may be changed at any time before or after judgment or final determination, as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-6\">(1) upon consent of both client and attorney, filed with the clerk or entered upon the minutes;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-7\">(2) upon the order of the court, upon the application of either client or attorney, after notice from one to the other.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b328-8\">Based on this statute, an attorney may be changed at any time with the consent of <em>both </em>the attorney and the client, or by order of the court after application of <em>either </em>the attorney or the client. Even if we were to assume <em>arguendo </em>that Ann-Marie and Stanley are the clients in this case, they failed to comply with either provision of the statute because they did not secure the consent of the attorney of record, nor did they apply to the District Court for an order to change the attorney of record. Just because Ann-Marie and Stanley failed to comply with the statute does not make the statute unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-9\">\u00b637 In addition, as we determined in the previous issue, while it is true that Ann-Marie and Stanley have a fundamental interest in the care, custody and control of C.K.O, they <em>voluntarily </em>divested themselves of control over C.KO.\u2019s legal action when they consented to the appointment of a GAL and conservator. Section 72-5-427, MCA, confers on the conservator the power to \u201cprosecute or defend actions, claims, or proceedings\u201d on behalf of the minor child, or to \u201cemploy persons, including attorneys,\u201d to assist in representing the interests of the minor child. Simply because Ann-Marie and Stanley are unhappy with the decision the GAL and conservator made regarding legal representation in C.KO.\u2019s cause of action, does not make the statute unconstitutional. Moreover, Ann-Marie and Stanley did not request <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>that the District Court replace O\u2019Neill as the GAL and conservator for C.K.O.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-4\">\u00b638  We conclude that Ann-Marie and Stanley have failed to meet their burden of proving the statutes unconstitutional beyond a reasonable doubt. Therefore, we hold that \u00a7\u00a7 37-61-403 and 72-5-427, MCA, are not unconstitutional as applied in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">Issue 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-6\">\u00b639 <em>Whether \u00a7 37-61-403, MCA, conflicts with the Montana Rules of Professional Conduct.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b329-7\">\u00b640 Ann-Marie and Stanley argue that \u00a7 37-61-403, MCA, attempts to override this Court\u2019s plenary power to control and direct the conduct of attorneys, especially regarding when and how an attorney must withdraw. They maintain that under \u00a7 37-61-403, MCA, a lawyer may only be removed from his duties if both the client and the lawyer agree. Consequently, they contend that \u00a7 37-61-403, MCA, is in conflict with the Montana Rules of Professional Conduct, specifically M. R. P. C. 1.16(a)(3), thus the statute must be declared unconstitutional as applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-8\">\u00b641 There is no conflict between \u00a7 37-61-403, MCA, and Rule 1.16(a)(3). Instead, the two work in conjunction with each other. Rule 1.16(a)(3) provides that a lawyer \u201cshall withdraw from the representation of a client if... the lawyer is discharged,\u201d while \u00a7 3 7-61-403, MCA, provides a method on how that discharge is to be accomplished<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>-upon the consent of <em>both </em>the attorney and the client, or by order of the court upon the application of <em>either </em>the attorney or the client.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-9\">\u00b642 Ann-Marie\u2019s and Stanley\u2019s rationale is based upon their incorrect assumption that they are the client in the personal injury proceedings pursued on behalf of C.K.O. by the GAL and conservator. However, because C.K.O. is a minor child, the GAL and conservator was granted the power and authority to make decisions on C.K.O.\u2019s behalf regarding the litigation. The Montana Rules of Professional Conduct specifically contemplate that a GAL and conservator should be appointed to represent an individual with diminished capacity such as a minor child. M. R. P. C. 1.14(b). Consistent with \u00a7 37-61-403, MCA, a change in counsel for CKO requires the consent of the client (C.KO.\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>GAL and conservator) and counsel, or an order of the court upon the application of either the attorney or the client.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-4\">\u00b643 In this case, when Viscomi received Morales\u2019 letter, Viscomi went to O\u2019Neill, C.KO.\u2019s GAL and conservator, and asked O\u2019Neill for his direction with respect to Ann-Marie\u2019s and Stanley\u2019s request that Viscomi withdraw. O\u2019Neill determined that, contrary to Ann-Marie\u2019s and Stanley\u2019s wishes, it would not be in C.KO.\u2019s best interests to change attorneys at this time. O\u2019Neill filed his \u201cReport to the Court\u201d stating that Viscomi has done \u201csignificant legal work in evaluating and preparing for the negotiation and resolution of the minor\u2019s claims against the tort-feasor that caused the minor\u2019s injuries.\u201d O\u2019Neill also stated that in his opinion Viscomi was \u201cbest suited to complete the negotiation and resolution of the minor\u2019s tort claims and that it would not be in the best interest of the minor to change legal counsel\u201d as suggested by her parents.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">\u00b644  We therefore hold that \u00a7 37-61-403, MCA, does not conflict with the Montana Rules of Professional Conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-6\">\u00b645 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b330-7\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES BAKER, WHEAT and RICE concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b325-11\"> At the time <em>Garrick </em>was decided, Fed.
