Edythe is in her late eighties and her son, Clark Rice, assists her in performing ranch duties. On January 20, 2006, Clark, Juanita Stands and Vianna Stewart were involved in a vehicular collision on Old Highway 87 on the Crow Reservation in Big Horn County. It was a cloudy evening and the sun had set at approximately 4:59 p.m. Some time between 5:00 p.m. and 5:30 p.m., in \u201cadvanced twilight,\u201d Clark turned a tractor onto Old Highway 87 from an intersecting dirt road. He could see cars approaching from a distance on the highway. As Clark pulled onto the highway and began travelling northbound, the tractor\u2019s left side extended into the highway\u2019s northbound lane. The tractor\u2019s lights were not illuminated. Juanita Stands, also driving northbound, approached at high speed and struck the tractor\u2019s left rear tire. The impact caused Juanita\u2019s-vehicle to spin into the neighboring lane, where it collided with Vianna Stewart\u2019s southbound vehicle. Juanita and Vianna sustained injuries from the accident. The tractor and both automobiles were total losses.</p>\n<p id=\"AG\">\u00b67 Beginning in December 2006, the parties spent nearly five years in litigation before the District Court to decide liability for the accident-related damages. Vianna filed an initial complaint alleging negligence against Clark and Juanita on December 1, 2006. Juanita filed a cross-claim against Clark, who filed a counter cross-claim against Juanita. Vianna later stipulated to dismissing the claims against Juanita, and amended her complaint to include Edythe as a defendant under the doctrines of <em>respondeat superior </em>and negligent entrustment. She alleged that Edythe owned the ranch and that Clark was operating the tractor on Edythe\u2019s behalf at the time of the accident. On September 8, 2009, Edythe filed a <em>pro se </em>answer denying that Clark was acting as her employee at the time of the accident. On December 11, 2009, through her retained counsel, Robert Stephens, Edythe filed an amended answer denying vicarious liability and negligent entrustment and cross-claimed against Juanita. On February 2,2010, Juanita amended her cross-claim to include Edythe as a defendant. The case was set for a December 15, 2009, jury trial, but the trial date was continued as the parties filed motions to dismiss and motions for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">\u00b68 By 2011, Clark and Edythe could no longer fulfill their obligations under the fee contracts with their attorneys. On January 7, 2011, Clark\u2019s counsel, Paula Saye-Dooper, filed a motion to withdraw from representation based on Clark\u2019s inability to pay the legal fees. Clark <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>consented to his counsel\u2019s withdrawal. On January 10, 2011, Vianna served \u201cRule 10 notice\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> upon Clark requiring him to appoint new counsel or proceed <em>pro se. </em>On January 12, 2011, the District Court granted Saye-Dooper\u2019s motion to withdraw from representation.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-4\">\u00b69 On January 21, 2011, Edythe\u2019s attorney, Robert Stephens, filed a Motion to Withdraw and Motion to Continue. He stated that his role in the lawsuit was intended to be \u201cancillary to lea[d] counsel, Paula Saye-Dooper,\u201d that he no longer had access to the trial preparation materials now in Clark\u2019s possession, that Edythe could no longer pay her fees, and that Edythe had become incompetent. His motion and supporting affidavit explained that \u201cEdythe Rice is no longer competent, in counsel\u2019s opinion, to understand the nature of the proceedings or to assist in her own defense.\u201d Having spoken with Edythe\u2019s physician, who \u201cfound mild cognitive impairment primarily] impacting recent memory and ability to recall details,\u201d Stephens expressed concern that Edythe\u2019s ability to testify as a witness would be significantly impaired. He stated in the affidavit that he had also spoken with Clark, who agreed that his mother \u201cno longer knows[] where she is, no longer has an understanding of the immediate circumstances, has no memory and is otherwise non <em>compos mentis.\u201d </em>He requested that the trial, now scheduled for February 2, 2011, be continued and that a conservator be appointed prior to any further proceedings because it would be \u201can injustice to require [an] incompetent woman to proceed to trial without representation[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">\u00b610 On February 4, 2011, Stephens filed a motion to allow Edythe to testify by deposition. The motion represented that, based on the medical opinion of Edythe\u2019s doctor, Edythe\u2019s mental condition would cause her to be \u201c\u2018unavailable\u2019 within the meaning of the Montana Rules of Civil Procedure for purposes of allowing her deposition testimony,\u201d and that Edythe \u201cmay not be a competent witness based upon her mental impairment!.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">\u00b611 On May 6, 2011, the District Court granted the motion to allow Edythe to testify by deposition and, on May 18,2011, it granted Robert Stephens\u2019s motion to withdraw from representation. The court did not address the question of Edythe\u2019s competency or Stephens\u2019s suggestion for appointment of a conservator. In February 2011, Clark filed a consent to waiver of a jury trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-7\">\u00b612 The District Court conducted a bench trial on July 7, 2011, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>which Juanita and Vianna were represented by counsel and Clark and Edythe appeared <em>pro se. </em>Edythe was physically present but did not present any evidence or participate in the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-4\">\u00b613 In its September 7, 2011 order, the District Court concluded that Clark was negligent <em>per se </em>for violating three traffic statutes: (1) \u00a7 61-8-343, MCA, by failing to yield to oncoming traffic when he entered the highway; (2) \u00a7 61-9-201, MCA, by failing to illuminate the lights on his tractor within one-half an hour after sunset; and (3) \u00a7 61-9-415(1), MCA, by failing to properly display an emblem while operating on a state highway a slow-moving vehicle normally used at speeds less than twenty-five miles per hour. The court determined that each statutory violation was an actual and proximate cause of the resulting collisions. The court further determined that Edythe was vicariously liable for the injuries because she was the principal of the ranch, Clark was her agent with regard to ranch business, and \u201cClark was acting within the scope of his duties at the time of the accident.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">\u00b614 Considering the atmospheric conditions at the time of the accident, the court also concluded that \u201cJuanita should have anticipated the presence of Clark\u2019s tractor in enough time to lessen the severity of the impact,\u201d and that her comparative negligence was responsible for twenty percent of her injuries. The court\u2019s judgment stated that Clark and Edythe were jointly and severally liable for eighty percent of Juanita\u2019s claimed damages, amounting to $582,516, one hundred percent of Vianna\u2019s claimed damages, amounting to $48,501.98, and for the cost of the action to both Juanita and Vianna. Clark, proceeding <em>pro se, </em>and Edythe, through appellate counsel, appealed to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b229-7\">\u00b615 We review the district court\u2019s factual findings for clear error and its legal conclusions for correctness. <em>Boyne USA, Inc. v. Spanish Peaks Dev., LLC, </em>2013 MT 1, \u00b6 28, 368 Mont. 143, 292 P.3d 432. We review the district court\u2019s evidentiary rulings for an abuse of discretion. <em>McEwen v. MCR, LLC, </em>2012 MT 319, \u00b6 16, 368 Mont. 38, 291 P.3d 1253.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-8\">\u00b616 We generally do not review issues raised for the first time on appeal. <em>Brookins v. Mote, </em>2012 MT 283, \u00b6 24, 367 Mont. 193, 292 P.3d 347. We may review \u201ca claimed error not previously raised in the district court which affects fundamental constitutional rights where failing to review it may result in a manifest miscarriage of justice, leave unsettled the question of the fundamental fairness of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>proceedings, or compromise the integrity of the judicial process.\u201d <em>Paulson v. Flathead Conserv. Dist., </em>2004 MT 136, \u00b6 40, 321 Mont. 364, 91 P.3d 569. This Court exercises plenary review of constitutional issues, \u201csuch as an alleged violation of the right to due process.\u201d <em>In re Marriage of Cini, </em>2011 MT 295, \u00b6 15, 363 Mont. 1, 266 P.3d 1257.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">\u00b617 <em>1. Whether Clark is entitled to a new trial and a new judge based on erroneous evidentiary rulings, biases ofwitnesses, the failure of some witnesses to attend trial, or the court\u2019s failure to appoint trial counsel.</em></p>\n<p id=\"Aqe\">\u00b618 In his <em>pro se </em>brief, Clark alleges numerous factual, evidentiary and procedural errors, which we summarize as follows: (1) inaccurate and fraudulent witness testimony, particularly with regard to the time of day that the accident took place and the order of events following the accident, (2) law enforcement withheld relevant evidence and failed to attend the trial and the court prevented Clark from presenting evidence, (3) the trial was procedurally unfair due to Clark\u2019s hearing issues and lack of representation by counsel, and (4) Clark did not knowingly and intelligently waive his right to a jury trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">\u00b619 We agree with the Appellees that Clark\u2019s factual challenges are unsupported and that he fails to provide any grounds for concluding that the court\u2019s findings were clearly erroneous. His evidentiary challenges are similarly unsupported by argument as to how any specific ruling was an abuse of discretion, or which relevant evidence the court refused to consider. Clark has not shown that the District Court abused its \u201cbroad\u201d discretion in deciding the admissibility of evidence or that any allegedly improper ruling materially affected his substantial rights. <em>Stevenson v. Felco Indus., </em>2009 MT 299, \u00b6 16, 352 Mont. 303, 216 P.3d 763; <em>see </em>M. R. Evid. 103(a) (\u201cError may not be predicated upon a ruling which admits or excludes evidence unless a substantial right of the party is affected[.]\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b230-7\">\u00b620 Though the trial transcript indicates that Clark on more than one occasion complained of having difficulty hearing, the District Court made every effort to accommodate his needs by repeating information for him and assuring that he heard and understood all of the proceedings as the trial progressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-8\">\u00b621 Clark asserts that he was entitled to court-appointed counsel. There is no absolute right to counsel in civil proceedings, however, particularly where a defendant\u2019s deprivation of liberty is not at stake. <em>See Turner v. </em>Rogers,_U.S._, 131 S. Ct. 2507, 2518 (2011); <em>see </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number><em>also In re Marriage of Prescott, </em>259 Mont. 293, 297, 856 P.2d 229, 232 (1993). Clark consented to the withdrawal of his counsel and chose to proceed <em>pro se.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b231-4\">\u00b622 Finally, on February 17, 2011, Clark filed a Waiver of Jury Trial, requesting that \u201cthe above-captioned matter be tried to the court sitting without a jury,\u201d which he signed on February 10, 2011. There is no indication that he did not understand that he was waiving his jury trial and that a bench trial would be held. Since Clark is not entitled to a new trial, he also is not entitled to a new judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">\u00b623 Accordingly, we affirm the District Court\u2019s judgment against Clark and his liability to Vianna and Juanita.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">\u00b624 <em>2. Whether the District Court committed reversible error by proceeding to trial without addressing Edythe\u2019s competency or ensuring the parties met statutory notice requirements, and whether the trial violated Edythe\u2019s right to due process.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b231-7\">\u00b625 Edythe argues, first, that the District Court erred by failing to address her mental competency, as requested by her counsel prior to trial; second, that the plaintiffs failed to serve her with statutorily-required notice following her counsel\u2019s withdrawal from representation; and third, that these pre-trial errors, as well as the trial in which she presented no defense, violated her fundamental right to due process of the law.</p>\n<p id=\"AA\">\n<em>a. Competency</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b231-8\">\u00b626 While she recognizes that a party suffering from mental health problems does not necessarily have a right to a competency evaluation or the assistance of a conservator, Edythe argues that \u201cthe District Court\u2019s failure to address this issue prior to the trial materially affected Edythe\u2019s rights at trial.\u201d She points out that, either her \u201cmental deficiencies were real and she deserved, at least, a cursory review\u201d of her competency to stand trial, \u201cor they were not, and she should have been afforded an opportunity to at a minimum testify, or better still, to have been treated as the party to the action that she was.\u201d Edythe\u2019s appellate counsel notes that, while Edythe was physically present at her trial, aside from a handful of instances, \u201cthe record is absolutely silent as to Edythe\u2019s participation,\u201d and indeed indicates Edythe \u201cwas not even in the courtroom as the trial progressed.\u201d The trial transcript indicates at one point that Edythe was outside of the courtroom eating, and the court, with Clark\u2019s approval, proceeded to hear testimony in her absence.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-9\">\u00b627 Vianna responds that there was no evidence Edythe suffered from mental health issues, given that \u201c[tjhere was no court-ordered mental <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>examination conducted on her prior to trial.\u201d Additionally, because the question of competency was raised only by \u201cancillary\u201d co-counsel in a motion to withdraw from representation, Vianna contends it effectively was raised for the first time on appeal and should not be reviewed. Juanita adds to these arguments that Stephens\u2019s motion requested as relief only his withdrawal as counsel and continuation of the trial date and, further, after filing the motion, he continued to represent Edythe for four months, but \u201cnever submitted any additional motion or evidence on behalf of Edythe to back up his contention.\u201d Offering no authority, she argues that Stephens was required to file a separate motion requesting a competency evaluation. According to both Appellees, Edythe did not preserve the issue because she failed to challenge her own competency when she appeared <em>pro se </em>at trial. For the reasons explained below, we disagree with these arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-4\">\u00b628 Under \u00a7 72-5-401, MCA, any person who is interested in the protected person\u2019s welfare may seek a conservatorship. <em>See In re Conservatorship of Kloss, </em>2005 MT 39, \u00b6\u00b6 8-10, 326 Mont. 117, 109 P.3d 205 (recognizing that even opposing counsel has standing to petition for a conservatorship under the statute). As noted, Stephens was Edythe\u2019s counsel of record when he filed a motion to withdraw, in which he raised concerns based on conversations with Edythe\u2019s doctor and Clark, as well as his own observations, that Edythe was incompetent and required a conservator. His motion stated in part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-5\">Edythe Rice is no longer competent, in counsel\u2019s opinion, to understand the nature of the proceedings or assist in her own defense. There has been a serious decline in her mental state, and it is believed that she would not be a competent witness and could only testify through her prior deposition. On January 14, 2011, counsel had telephonic contact with Dr. John Foster, Edythe Rice\u2019s physician. He advised that he had conducted a mini mental status exam (MMS). He found mild cognitive impairment primarily] impacting recent memory and ability to recall details. He stated that Edythe would be fairly easily confused especially under stressful conditions. He concluded her ability to testify as a witness would be significantly compromised.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-6\">It is counsel\u2019s opinion that Edythe Rice, as an incompetent person, needs to have a conservator appointed so that she may have a legal representative to protect her interests, and that the current status of her mental health and the circumstances under which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>she is currently bound, dictate the need for a conservatorship before any proceedings may move forward in this matter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-4\">The remedy is to continue the matter and have a conservator appointed to Edythe Rice in order to protect her legal interests.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AvF\">\u00b629 Within two weeks of filing his motion to withdraw, Stephens filed a motion to allow Edythe to testify by deposition, which stated again that Edythe \u201cmay not be a competent witness based on her mental impairment[.]\u201d These pre-trial motions raised the issue of Edythe\u2019s competency before the District Court and requested as relief the appointment of a conservator.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">\u00b630 After approximately five years of pre-trial litigation, Edythe\u2019s attorney raised concerns, based in part on her doctor\u2019s opinion, that she was incompetent and could no longer understand the proceedings against her. Edythe then proceeded to trial without counsel, did not present a defense, and was apparently absent from the courtroom during portions of her trial. Whether or not Stephens filed a separate motion, we conclude that he put the court on notice of the problem sufficiently to preserve the issue for review. <em>See State v. West, </em>2008 MT 338, \u00b6 17, 346 Mont. 244, 194 P.3d 683 (rationale behind the \u201ctimely-objection rule\u201d is to bring \u201calleged errors to the attention of each court involved, so that actual error can be prevented or corrected at first opportunity\u201d) (quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">\u00b631  During trial, Clark expressed concern about his mother\u2019s mental condition and her ability to serve as a witness. He stated, \u201cI have a doctor\u2019s statement that said she should not be put on the court stand.\u201d The court recognized \u201cthere\u2019s no guarantee that what she\u2019s able to testify to she has an understanding of at this time,\u201d and decided to admit her deposition as testimony. The District Court faced an understandably difficult challenge in attempting to provide appropriate procedural protections to two unrepresented litigants where significant interests were at stake. <em>See Turner, </em>131 S. Ct. at 2519. The court aptly took measures to mitigate Edythe\u2019s lack of representation and limited ability to comprehend trial proceedings by permitting her to adopt her deposition as her trial testimony. <em>See </em>Richard Zorza, <em>A New Day for Judges and the Self-Represented: The Implications of Turner v. Rogers, </em>50 Judges\u2019 J., 16 (Fall 2011) (noting that best practices in <em>pro se </em>cases include allowing unrepresented parties to adopt written submissions as sworn testimony). We nonetheless recognize, based on our review of the entire record in this case, that the failure to evaluate Edythe\u2019s competency prior to trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>raises significant questions of the fundamental fairness of the proceedings with respect to her unrepresented participation in the trial. We conclude that these circumstances required an evaluation of Edythe\u2019s need for a conservator.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-4\">\n<em>b. \u201cRule 10 Notice\u201d Requirement</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">\u00b632 Edythe argues, secondly, that the Plaintiffs failed to meet the \u201cRule 10 notice\u201d requirements provided in U. Dist. Ct. R. 10 and \u00a7 37-61-405, MCA, after Stephens withdrew from representation. The rule and statute require that when an attorney withdraws from representing a party to an action or proceeding, the opposing party <em>must, </em>\u201cbefore any further proceedings are had\u201d against that party, provide the party with notice requiring the party to appoint new counsel or personally appear in further proceedings. In <em>Quantum Electric, Inc. v. Schaeffer, </em>2003 MT 29, \u00b6\u00b6 28, 34, 314 Mont. 193, 64 P.3d 1026, we established a \u201cclear rule\u201d requiring strict compliance with the statute and rule \u201cwhen a party becomes unrepresented.\u201d Noting the \u201crelative ease with which proper notice is given,\u201d we clarified that the Rule 10 notice requirement was satisfied only if it contained each of the components listed in the statute:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-6\">Accordingly, we hold that in order to properly protect the interests of the unrepresented party, the opposing party, as required by the plain language of \u00a7 37-61-405, MCA, must require the unrepresented party, by written notice, to appoint another attorney or appear in person. Further, that written notice must include the date of the next action required in the case. In addition, according to Rule 10, U. Dist. Ct. R., written notice must also include notice that if the unrepresented party fails to appoint an attorney or appear in person within twenty days from the date of the notice, the action or other proceeding will proceed and may result in a judgment or other order being entered against him<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Af4\"><em>Quantum Electric, </em>\u00b6 27.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-7\">\u00b633 In <em>Quantum Electric, </em>the plaintiffs failed to provide Rule 10 notice following withdrawal of defendants\u2019 counsel, but argued that the defendants\u2019 substantial rights were not prejudiced because they had actual notice of the proceedings. There, the district court\u2019s order for withdrawal of counsel, served on the defendants, included specific language stating that they must advise the court of new counsel within thirty days or proceed <em>pro se. Quantum Electric, </em>\u00b6 5. We clarified that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>the defendant\u2019s receipt of actual notice and appearance in subsequent proceedings did not render such error harmless and reversed a summary judgment ruling in favor of the plaintiffs. <em>Quantum Electric, </em>\u00b6 35.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-4\">\u00b634  Edythe points out that Vianna provided Rule 10 notice to Clark after his counsel moved to withdraw, but did not provide any such notice to Edythe following the court\u2019s May 18, 2011 Order Allowing Withdrawal of Edythe Rice\u2019s Counsel of Record. Vianna claims that the notice sent to Clark on January 10, 2011, \u201cwas intended for both parties, although it only included Clark\u2019s name.\u201d She fails to recognize that Edythe was a separate party to the lawsuit, on whom separate notice had to be served. Her suggestion that notice served upon Clark was sufficient for both parties is, moreover, implausible: Edythe\u2019s counsel of record was not granted leave to withdraw from representation until more than four months after Vianna served notice upon Clark.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">\u00b635 We disagree with Vianna\u2019s contention that <em>Quantum Electric </em>is inapplicable because, there, \u201c[t]he plaintiff failed to send any kind of notice as contemplated by Rule 10 and the statute,\u201d whereas here, notice sent to Clark provided Edythe with actual notice as demonstrated by her appearance at the trial. The plaintiffs in this case failed to send Edythe any form of Rule 10 notice following withdrawal of her counsel and we have made clear that actual notice is insufficient. <em>Quantum Electric, </em>\u00b6 35. Nor does it matter here, as Vianna argues, that <em>Quantum Electric </em>was decided prior to trial, on summary judgment-in both cases, plaintiffs failed to meet the statutory notice requirements and final judgment was entered in their favor. The Rule 10 notice requirement is an important procedural safeguard intended specifically to protect unrepresented litigants like Edythe from procedural unfairness. <em>Puhto v. Smith Funeral Chapels, Inc., </em>2011 MT 279, \u00b6 16, 362 Mont. 447, 264 P.3d 1142. We hold that the plaintiffs\u2019 failure to provide Rule 10 notice to Edythe prejudiced her substantial rights and constitutes reversible error. <em>Quantum Electric, </em>\u00b6 36. Accordingly, on the authority established in <em>Quantum Electric, </em>we agree with Edythe that the Plaintiffs\u2019 failure to serve her with Rule 10 notice at the time she became unrepresented requires reversal of the District Court\u2019s judgment against her.</p>\n<p id=\"AVv\">c. <em>Due Process</em></p>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">\u00b636 Finally, Edythe argues that the District Court denied her the opportunity to participate in her trial because she did not deliver an opening statement, call or cross-examine witnesses, give a closing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>argument, or have the opportunity to submit proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law. She states that, while the District Court made \u201cmodel\u201d efforts to guide Clark through the trial as a <em>pro se </em>litigant, \u201cEdythe was hardly afforded such accommodations.\u201d We must again acknowledge the difficulty of fairly and efficiently guiding unrepresented parties through trial proceedings and commend the District Court\u2019s efforts to accommodate the parties\u2019 needs in this case. While her appellate counsel again points out that Edythe was silent throughout the proceedings, there is no indication in the record that the court prevented Edythe from presenting a defense. We have concluded instead that Edythe\u2019s failure to participate in the proceedings raises concerns about her competency to stand trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-4\">\u00b637 Our review of the record reveals that Edythe was generally not treated as a separate party in many of the pre-trial and trial proceedings. The court failed to address her competency despite her counsel\u2019s request, the Appellees failed to provide her with Rule 10 notice after her counsel withdrew, and she was deemed liable for all of the accident-related damages without actively participating in her own trial. Appellees argue repeatedly that these issues should have been raised at trial by the parties. We, however, agree with Edythe\u2019s appellate counsel that denying review of these issues would be substantially unjust-\u201cnamely, that someone who might have mental health issues, was denied clearly-required statutory notice regarding the proceedings, all while appearing without counsel, be required to raise all of these concerns to the District Court at a trial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">\u00b638 Because we reverse and remand on Edythe\u2019s first two claims, we need not decide whether, independent of those concerns, the conduct of the trial itself violated Edythe\u2019s due process rights. <em>Weidow v. Uninsured Employers\u2019 Fund, </em>2010 MT 292, \u00b6 22, 359 Mont. 77, 246 P.3d 704 (\u201cThis Court attempts to avoid constitutional issues whenever possible.\u201d) (quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b236-6\">\u00b639 For the foregoing reasons, we reverse the District Court\u2019s judgment against Edythe and remand the case for an evaluation of Edythe\u2019s need for a conservator and new trial as to Edythe\u2019s vicarious liability only.</p>\n<judges id=\"b236-7\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES COTTER, RICE and MORRIS concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b228-8\"> Rule 10 of the Uniform District Court Rules (U.
