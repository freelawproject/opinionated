Hearing the loud conversation, Detention Officers Eric Lechleitner (Lechleitner) and Michael Gauci (Gauci) stepped into the area. The matter escalated when McDonald refused to comply with the instructions of the officers to immediately report to the maximum security unit. A physical altercation ensued, wherein McDonald bit Pavalone on the arm. McDonald was charged with one count of felony assault on a police officer in violation of \u00a7 45-5-210, MCA.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The first trial resulted in a mistrial when the jury was unable to reach a verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-11\">\u00b65 The case was retried to a jury on September 26-27,2011. Pavalone testified she had been bitten by McDonald, and Lechleitner and Gauci testified that Pavalone had yelled that she was being bitten during the altercation. Detention Officer Corey Hawkins testified that he observed a red mark with what appeared to be saliva on Pavalone\u2019s arm after the altercation. McDonald testified she had not bitten Pavalone, and Katie Garding, another inmate, testified that she did not see McDonald bite Pavalone. The prosecutor\u2019s closing arguments included the following statements:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-12\">Did Paige Pavalone get bit? She said, she got bit... During the time of this incident, both Officer Gauci and Officer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>Lechleitner heard Paige say-stop biting me, or whatever.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-5\">And as you\u2019re looking at the credibility of these witnesses... think about these officers.... It would have been a very easy thing-for instance, Officer Hawkins to say-oh, sure, I heard her say something similar-but, they didn\u2019t do that. They were making a real effort to be as clear with you, as they possibly could. It\u2019s only about what they remember. But, even, with that, you have Paige Pavalone and two other officers saying that in the middle of this, she said-stop biting my arm. Why in the world-why in the world would she say that, unless that was happening to her?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-6\">Look at their appearance, their manner, their fairness, their candor, their intelligence. What is their interest in the outcome of the case? I\u2019m not telling you that none of the officers care about how this case comes out.... <em>But, their interest in this is way, way, way less than the Defendant\u2019s interest in this. </em>She\u2019s going on trial-she\u2019s the one who would be convicted.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-7\">We don\u2019t really have anything here in terms of character and truthfulness. We have some conflicts with our statements. This instruction says the evidence from one witness, you believe, is sufficient. This case could have been the State calling one witness-Paige Pavalone.... If you believe her, that could be the end of the case. That\u2019s all the testimony the State would have been obligated to provide. If you believe that one witness-now, obviously, we want to provide as much we can, so we provided the other witnesses. <em>But, she\u2019s a completely believable witness. </em>Ask yourselves, as you deliberate this \u2014 what\u2019s not to believe about her testimony? It\u2019s supported by everything....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b507-8\">\u00b66 During his rebuttal, the prosecutor stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-9\">[Wjhat I\u2019d like to do is go through some of the comments that [defense counsel] Mr. Daly made. I don\u2019t agree with his characterization that this is an overreaction, that there was too much force used-I should say, I don\u2019t personally-my personal-has nothing to do with this. It\u2019s not even proper for you to consider, but <em>I don\u2019t believe </em>the evidence shows that there was an overreaction here by officer Pavalone. <em>I don\u2019t believe </em>their evidence shows there was excessive force used. <em>I don\u2019t believe </em>that the evidence shows Ms. McDonald was injured, significantly. <em>I don\u2019t believe </em>that the evidence shows that this was a fight picked by Paige Pavalone.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>Officer Pavalone\u2019s testimony-Mr. Daly says she couldn\u2019t remember much.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-5\">I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any flaw in what [Pavalone] said, that\u2019s significant. There\u2019s certainly, differences. What does that mean? That means these people didn\u2019t rehearse their testimony. They\u2019re coming in and <em>telling you the truth. </em>This isn\u2019t some story, they\u2019re telling you. They\u2019re telling you what they, honestly, remember.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A0N\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b508-6\">\u00b67 McDonald\u2019s counsel did not object to any of these comments. The jury returned a guilty verdict. McDonald appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-7\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b508-8\">\u00b68 \u201cWe generally do not review on appeal issues that were not raised before the district court. However, we may undertake review of such an issue under the plain error doctrine in situations that implicate a defendant\u2019s fundamental constitutional rights when failing to review the alleged error may result in a manifest miscarriage of justice, leave unsettled the question of the fundamental fairness of the proceedings, or compromise the integrity of the judicial process.\u201d <em>State v. Hayden, </em>2008 MT 274, \u00b6 17, 345 Mont. 252, 190 P.3d 1091 (citing <em>State v. Daniels, </em>2003 MT 247, \u00b6 20, 317 Mont. 331, 77 P.3d 224). The decision to invoke plain error review is a discretionary one that is to be used sparingly on a case-by-case basis. <em>Hayden, </em>\u00b6 17 (citing <em>State v. Rosling, </em>2008 MT 62, \u00b6 77, 342 Mont. 1, 180 P.3d 1102).</p>\n<p id=\"b508-9\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b508-10\">\u00b69 <em>Did the prosecutor\u2019s comments during closing argument constitute plain error?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b508-11\">\u00b610 Both the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Article II, Section 24 of the Montana Constitution guarantee criminal defendants the right to a fair trial by a jury. <em>Hayden, </em>\u00b6 27. \u201cA prosecutor\u2019s misconduct may be grounds for reversing a conviction and granting a new trial if the conduct deprives the defendant of a fair and impartial trial <em>.\u2019\u2019Hayden, </em>\u00b6 27 (citing <em>Clausell v. State, </em>2005 MT 33, \u00b6 11, 326 Mont. 63, 106 P.3d 1175). \u201cWe consider alleged improper statements during closing argument in the context of the entire argument.\u201d <em>State v. Makarchuk, </em>2009 MT 82, \u00b6 24, 349 Mont. 507, 204 P.3d 1213 (citing <em>State v. Roubideaux, </em>2005 MT 324, \u00b6 15, 329 Mont. 521, 125 P.3d 1114). \u201cWe will not presume prejudice from the alleged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>misconduct, rather the defendant must show that the argument violated his substantial rights.\u201d <em>Makarchuk, </em>\u00b6 24 (citing <em>Roubideaux, </em>\u00b6 ID-</p>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">\u00b611 McDonald argues that the prosecutor\u2019s comments during closing arguments constitute misconduct and warrant reversal of her conviction under plain error review. She argues that the prosecutor repeatedly made direct comments about the reliability of the witnesses. Specifically, she focuses on the phrases used by the prosecutor, highlighted in the above block quotation, to describe the State\u2019s witnesses as \u201ctelling you the truth,\u201d that \u201ctheir interest in this is way, way, way less than the Defendant\u2019s interest in this,\u201d that Paige Pavalone was \u201ca completely believable witness,\u201d and that the prosecutor \u201cdid not believe\u201d McDonald\u2019s arguments.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> She relies primarily on our decision reversing the defendant\u2019s conviction for prosecutorial misconduct in <em>Hayden.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b509-7\">\u00b612 We exercised plain error review and reversed the defendant\u2019s conviction in <em>Hayden </em>for multiple errors committed by the prosecutor. <em>Hayden, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 31-32. Without objection, the prosecutor asked the investigating officer about the credibility of the witnesses and elicited his impression about the credibility of the statements they had given at the time of the alleged crime. <em>Hayden, </em>\u00b6 31. The prosecutor \u201cwent so far as to ask [the officer] directly whether he believed [the witness] was telling the truth when he was interviewed, eliciting a response that they were telling the truth in their initial statements.\u201d <em>Hayden, </em>\u00b6 31. Noting that a witness may not comment on the credibility of another witness\u2019s testimony, we held that \u201c[t]his line of questioning, which elicited [the officer\u2019s] opinion on the credibility of other witnesses, is unacceptable and invades the province of the jury.\u201d <em>Hayden, </em>\u00b6 31 (citing <em>State v. St. Germain, </em>2007 MT 28, \u00b6 27, 336 Mont. 17, 153 P.3d 591).</p>\n<p id=\"b509-8\">\u00b613 The prosecutor in <em>Hayden </em>had also \u201cimpinged on the jury\u2019s role by offering his own opinion as to witnesses\u2019 testimony during his closing argument\u201d when he argued that the state\u2019s witnesses were \u201cbelievable\u201d and that the jury could rely upon the officer\u2019s testimony. <em>Hayden, </em>\u00b6 32. The prosecutor also improperly testified \u201cby vouching for the efficacy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>of the search of Hayden\u2019s residence and by stating his opinion that a scale found in the residence was used for drugs.\u201d <em>Hayden, </em>\u00b6 32. We reasoned that the prosecutor\u2019s arguments had \u201cunfairly added the probative force of his own personal, professional, and official influence to the testimony of the witnesses.\u201d <em>Hayden, </em>\u00b6 33. We concluded that the prosecutor\u2019s conduct had \u201cinvaded the role of the jury, and ... created a clear danger that the jurors adopted the prosecutor\u2019s views instead of exercising their own independent judgment.\u201d <em>Hayden, </em>\u00b6 33.</p>\n<p id=\"A3HM\">\u00b614 We have explained that \u201c[djuring closing argument, a prosecutor may comment on \u2018the gravity of the crime charged, the volume of evidence, credibility of witnesses, inferences to be drawn from various phases of evidence, and legal principles involved, to be presented in instructions to the jury ....\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Green, </em>2009 MT 114, \u00b6 33, 350 Mont. 141, 205 P.3d 798 (quoting <em>State v. Staat, </em>251 Mont. 1, 10, 822 P.2d 643, 648 (1991). \u201cWhile it is generally improper for the prosecution to offer <em>personal opinions </em>as to the credibility of the accused or the witnesses ... \u2018it is proper for a prosecutor to comment on conflicts and contradictions in testimony, as well as to comment on the evidence presented and suggest to the jury inferences which may be drawn therefrom.\u2019 \u201d <em>Green, </em>\u00b6 33 (quoting <em>State v. Gladue, </em>1999 MT 1, \u00b6 15, 293 Mont. 1, 972 P.2d 827) (emphasis added). As noted above, we review alleged improper comments \u201cin the context of the entire argument.\u201d <em>Makarchuk, </em>\u00b6 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">\u00b615 Unlike <em>Hayden, </em>the thrust of the prosecutor\u2019s comments at issue here was argument about the evidence and the instructions, rather than interjecting his personal opinion. McDonald cites the prosecutor\u2019s repeated comment that he \u201cdid not believe\u201d McDonald\u2019s case, but the context demonstrates he was actually arguing he \u201cdid not believe <em>the evidence shows\u201d </em>that McDonald\u2019s assertions of Pavalone being responsible for the fight were supported. McDonald argues that the prosecutor vouched for the State\u2019s witnesses by stating \u201ctheir interest in this is way, way, way less than the Defendant\u2019s interest,\u201d but this was argument about the model criminal jury instruction that told the jury to determine whether a witness was \u201cworthy of belief\u2019 by considering \u201cwhether the witnesses have an interest in the outcome of the case or any motive.\u201d The prosecutor\u2019s comment about Pavalone being \u201ccompletely believable\u201d was made in the context of arguing the model instruction that the testimony of one witness, if believed, was sufficient to prove any fact in the case. Additionally, unlike <em>Hayden, </em>the prosecutor here made no effort to personally testify about the evidence or to elicit witness testimony about the credibility of other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-5\">\u00b616 Prosecutors do need to choose their words circumspectly while arguing their case to the jury. Taken in isolation, the prosecutor\u2019s comments that Pavalone was \u201ccompletely believable\u201d and that the State\u2019s witnesses were \u201ctelling you the truth\u201d raise facial concerns that the prosecutor was attempting to vouch for the witnesses and interject his personal opinion. However, when viewed in context of the entire argument, the comments were very brief deviations from the prosecutor\u2019s overall approach and are a far cry from the egregious conduct of the prosecutor in <em>Hayden.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b511-6\">\u00b617  We do not presume that alleged prosecutorial misconduct was prejudicial, and the defendant \u201cmust show that the argument violated his substantial rights.\u201d <em>Makarchuk, </em>\u00b6 24. Further, in order to exercise plain error review, this Court considers whether the \u201cfundamental fairness of the proceedings\u201d or \u201cthe integrity of the judicial process\u201d is at stake. <em>Hayden, </em>\u00b6 17. When an issue of prosecutorial misconduct has been properly preserved for appeal by way of a motion for mistrial or motion for new trial, the district court has discretion in its handling of the matter. This Court\u2019s review of such preserved issues is for abuse of that discretion. <em>See State v. Tadewaldt, </em>2010 MT 177, \u00b6 9, 357 Mont. 208, 237 P.3d 1273 (district court ruling on motion for mistrial for prosecutorial misconduct reviewed for abuse of discretion); <em>State v. Whitlow, </em>285 Mont. 430, 446, 949 P.2d 239, 249 (1997) (district court ruling on motion for new trial based upon prosecutorial misconduct reviewed for abuse of discretion). We are mindful that accepting an unpreserved issue of this nature by plain error review bypasses the exercise of discretion by the district court and our proper review thereof. <em>See State v. Stearns, </em>2008 MT 356, \u00b6 19, 346 Mont. 348, 195 P.3d 794 (Generally, \u201c[a]bsent an objection, an alleged error is not appropriate for review.... We will not fault a trial court where that court has no opportunity to correct itself if warranted.\u201d). In consideration of these principles, we conclude that the challenged comments made in closing argument did not raise the specter of prosecutorial misconduct necessitating the exercise of plain error review to protect fundamental fairness of this proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-7\">\u00b618 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b511-8\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES WHEAT and BAKER concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b506-14\"> At the time of the altercation, McDonald had been detained pending resolution of a petition to revoke a previous sentence for felony assault.

We said \u201cthat it is improper for a prosecutor to offer personal opinions as to witness credibility.\u201d <em>Hayden, </em>\u00b6 28. We cited <em>State v. Stringer, </em>271 Mont. 367, 381, 897 P.2d 1063, 1072 (1995), in which we said the \u201cCourt has been unequivocal in its admonitions to prosecutors to stop improper comments and we have made it clear that we will reverse a case where counsel invades the province of the jury.\u201d <em>Hayden, </em>\u00b6 28. Unfortunately, the Court now abandons this \u201cunequivocal\u201d high ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">\u00b621 I agree with the Court that it is not improper for a prosecutor to comment on conflicts and contradictions in testimony. Opinion, \u00b6 14. It is also acceptable to tell the jurors they have a right to believe one witness over another. The breach occurs when the prosecutor attests <em>personally </em>to the veracity of a witness, and tells the jurors whom he <em>personally </em>believes to be telling the truth. This is what occurred in <em>Hayden, </em>leading a unanimous Court to conclude that plain error was established \u201cas the record leaves unsettled the question of the fundamental fairness of the proceedings.\u201d <em>Hayden, </em>\u00b6 33. The same result is compelled here.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-6\">\u00b622 Our effort to distinguish <em>Hayden </em>from this case is unavailing. The prosecutor\u2019s comments were replete with his beliefs of who was telling the truth. He told the jury that <em>he did not believe </em>the evidence shows that these officers overreacted, <em>he did not believe </em>the evidence shows there was excessive force, <em>he did not believe </em>the evidence shows that McDonald was injured. He told the jury: \u201cThey\u2019re [the officers] coming in and telling you the truth.\u201d He told the jury: \u201c[S]he\u2019s [Pavalone] a completely believable witness.\u201d How is this different from <em>Hayden, </em>in which we faulted the prosecutor for telling the jury that the social worker and the detective are \u201cbelievable\u201d and that the jury could rely on those witnesses? It isn\u2019t, the Court\u2019s strained distinctions notwithstanding. As we said in <em>Hayden, </em>\u201c[i]t is for the jury, not an attorney trying a case, to determine which witnesses are believable and whose testimony is reliable.\u201d <em>Hayden, </em>\u00b6 32.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-7\">\u00b623 In <em>State v. Arlington, </em>265 Mont. 127, 875 P.2d 307 (1994), we were asked to exercise plain error review after the prosecutor commented on the credibility of the defendant, among other alleged errors. We concluded that the prosecutor did commit error in making such comments but declined to reverse because the evidence against Arlington was \u201coverwhelming.\u201d <em>Arlington, </em>265 Mont, at 158, 875 P.2d at 325. However, we observed that had there not been overwhelming <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>evidence of Arlington\u2019s guilt, \u201cthe prosecution in this case might well be looking forward to a new trial by reason of the prosecutor\u2019s comments.\u201d <em>Arlington, </em>265 Mont, at 158, 875 P.2d at 325.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\">\u00b624 Here, the evidence against McDonald was anything but \u201coverwhelming.\u201d As the Court notes, in fact, the first trial of this case ended with a hung jury. Opinion, \u00b6 4. At the close of this trial, the prosecutor acknowledged that a photograph of the officer\u2019s arm \u201cdoesn\u2019t really show much of anything.\u201d There being no direct evidence that Pavalone had been bitten, the entire case therefore boiled down to whom the jury would believe-McDonald and her supporting witness, or Pavalone and her supporting witnesses. The prosecutor wrongly inserted himself into this critical determination by telling the jurors which witnesses were believable. It is precisely this type of close case that presents \u201ca clear danger that the jurors adopted the prosecutor\u2019s views instead of exercising their own independent judgment.\u201d <em>Hayden, </em>\u00b6 33.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-6\">\u00b625 We err in ignoring our well-reasoned analysis in <em>Hayden </em>and condoning this prosecutor\u2019s repeated invasion of the province of the jury with his personal opinions of witness veracity. I would reverse and remand for a new trial.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
