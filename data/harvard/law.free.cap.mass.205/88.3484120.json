This removal was not necessary for the preservation of the property described in the policy from fire and no assent in writing or in print of the defendant was given to such removal.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b112-13\">On April 12, 1908, a fire occurred at No. 70\u00a3 Marlborough Street in Chelsea, and the property described in the policy was totally destroyed. Within a few days thereafter, the plaintiff\u2019s attorney called upon one Herbert F. Blood, a special agent of the defendant, and told him that he represented the plaintiff, that she was burned out in the conflagration and that she had a policy in the defendant company. Blood told the plaintiff\u2019s attorney that he would look into the matter and advise him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Ae-\">On April 17, 1908, Blood wrote to the plaintiff\u2019s attorney as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>follows: \u201c Referring to the Pringle matter, Chelsea, about which you spoke to me at my office yesterday, have looked up our records and found that on January 12, 1906, we issued a policy to Margaret J. Pringle, covering household furniture at No. 4 Riverside Street, Roxbury, Mass; on June 6, 1906, the insurance was transferred to No. 75 Sixth Street, Chelsea. I have examined the building to-day and found that there is no damage resulting from the conflagration of last Sunday, therefore there can be no claim under this policy.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b113-4\">Thereafter there was no communication between the plaintiff or the plaintiff\u2019s attorney and the defendant or Darling and Russell or Blood except that on May 4, 1908, the plaintiff\u2019s attorney called at Blood\u2019s office. Blood was out, and the plaintiff\u2019s attorney left word that he had called.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b113-5\">On May 22,1908, this action was brought.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b113-6\">On January 1,1903, the firm of Darling and Russell, having a usual place of business at No. 55 Kilby Street, Boston, Mass., were the general agents of the defendant for Boston, Everett, Chelsea, and certain other places, duly authorized by the defendant to issue policies of fire insurance and make indorsements thereon. Darling and Russell also were empowered by the defendant to appoint subordinate agents of the company.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b113-7\">On January 1,1903, Darling and Russell notified the insurance commissioner that they had appointed as \u201c subordinate agent \u201d of the defendant one Jesse F. Rogers of Roslindale, Mass.; and on January 3,1903, the insurance commissioner issued to Rogers a license stating that the Spring Garden Insurance Company was authorized through licensed, resident agents, to transact the business of fire insurance in this Commonwealth, and that Rogers \u201c has duly complied with the laws relating to agents of such companies and is authorized to transact within this Commonwealth, for the aforesaid company, the business of fire insurance so far as he may be legally empowered to do by the aforesaid company as its sub-agent.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b113-8\">Darling and Russell continued to be such agents until the latter part of the year 1908, and Rogers until July 1, 1908, from year to year received from the insurance commissioner a certificate stating that his license was renewed and was continued in force for the period of one year from date. Rogers was not author<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>ized by the defendant nor by Darling and Russell, nor by any one else in behalf of the defendant, to make contracts of insurance, or to make indorsements on policies, or to assent to removals of property, nor did he during the period of his subordinate agency make any contracts of insurance, nor assent, in writing or in print, to removals of property, nor make any indorsement on any of the defendant\u2019s policies.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b114-3\">Both policies No. 5081 and No. 28571 were negotiated by Rogers from Darling and Russell, and on each occasion of removal he received the policy from the plaintiff, forwarded it to Darling and Russell, and upon its return by them, turned it over to the plaintiff when she called for it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b114-4\">On or about June 15, 1907, the plaintiff took the policy No. 28571 to Rogers and directed that the policy be changed to cover her property at No. 70\u00a3 Marlborough Street, Chelsea, Mass. Rogers took the policy and told the plaintiff that he would arrange for the transfer of it and that the property would be covered at the new location.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b114-5\">Thereafter, the plaintiff saw Rogers once a week for a period of three or four weeks and on each occasion asked Rogers for her policy and Rogers replied that it had not been returned. On the last occasion, he told her that when it did return he would keep it for her until she called.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b114-6\">Neither Darling and Russell nor the defendant company ever had possession of the policy No. 28571 after June 6,1906, when it was returned by Darling and Russell to Rogers who turned it over to the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b114-7\">Neither the defendant nor Darling and Russell before the bringing of this action knew that the plaintiff had given to Rogers the policy on or about June 15, 1907, nor of the conversations between the plaintiff and Rogers on that date and on later dates.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b114-8\">If these facts warranted a finding for the plaintiff damages were to be assessed in the sum of $500; if not, judgment was to be entered for the defendant.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b114-9\">The judge found for the defendant; and the plaintiff appealed.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b114-10\"><em>F. </em>Juggins, for the plaintiff, submitted a brief.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b114-11\"><em>W. L. </em>Game, for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b114-12\">Morton, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Auu\">Assuming without deciding that the special agent Blood had authority to waive the proof of loss and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>submission to arbitration, we do not find it necessary to decide whether the letter sent by him to the plaintiff\u2019s attorney could be found to constitute such waiver, since we are of opinion that the policy was void for want of the defendant\u2019s written or printed assent to the removal of the goods from Sixth Street to Marlborough Street. The policy expressly provided that it should be void if the property was removed without the written or printed assent of the company, except that, if a removal should be necessary for the preservation of the property from fire, the policy should be valid without such assent for five days thereafter. It is not contended that it was necessary for the protection of the property to remove it, or that the company or the general agents Darling and Russell, whose territory included Chelsea, assented in writing or in print to the removal. The contention is in effect that the company is estopped by reason of what occurred between the plaintiff and Rogers from setting up that there was no written or printed assent by'it or its authorized agents to the removal. But it is expressly agreed that \u201c Rogers was not authorized by the defendant nor by Darling and Russell, nor by any one else in behalf of the defendant, to make contracts of insurance, nor to make indorsements on policies, nor to assent to removals of property,\u201d and that he did not \u201c during the period of his subordinate agency make any contracts of insurance, nor assent, in writing or in print, to removals of property, nor make any indorsement on any of the defendant\u2019s policies.\u201d It is also expressly agreed that \u201cNeither the defendant nor said Darling and Russell prior to the bringing of this suit knew that the plaintiff had given to said Rogers said policy, on or about June 15, 1907 [the date when, as the plaintiff testified, she took the policy to Rogers to have it changed so as to cover the property at Marlborough Street], nor of the conversations between the plaintiff and said Rogers on that date and on later dates.\u201d There was nothing, therefore, in the nature of the authority which Rogers had, nor any such knowledge on the defendant\u2019s part of what had transpired between the plaintiff and Rogers as to estop the defendant from objecting that the policy was void for want of its written or printed assent to the removal of the property. The fact that Rogers had transmitted the policy from the plaintiff to Darling and Russell for their written or printed assent to previous re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>mov\u00e1is does not and cannot operate to estop the defendant from relying on the fact that no such written or printed assent was procured to the removal in question. It is not necessary to consider whether Rogers is personally liable to the plaintiff. It follows that the judgment in favor of the defendant must be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-3\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
