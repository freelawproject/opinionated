But the only evidence upon which this contention can rest is the remark of counsel for the purchaser, who testified as a witness, that he informed the defendant that the plaintiff was the broker for his client. If by this remark anything more was meant than that the purchaser\u2019s attention had been called to the property by the plains tiff, the testimony of the other witnesses amply warranted a finding, negativing any double employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-13\">It is next urged that the terms fixed by the sale were not in accordance with the defendant\u2019s instructions. But if it be assumed that the sale was to be for cash, the judge upon the evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>deuce could find ifc had been negotiated on this basis, and that there was a valid tender of performance by the purchaser which the defendant refused.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">The defendant\u2019s request for a ruling, that upon all the evidence the plaintiff could not recover was properly refused.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b227-12\"> There was evidence that the defendant had asked the plaintiff to procure a purchaser for $1,400, but that \u201c there were no other terms made as to how the property should be sold \u201d; that the plaintiff procured a customer who was willing and offered to pay cash to the defendant, but that the defendant, after failing to keep appointments with an attorney at law employed by the customer, finally said that he had been advised not to sell.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
