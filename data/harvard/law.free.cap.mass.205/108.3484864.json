P. Sweeney L. S. Cox, </em>for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"b131-9\"><em>W. H. Niles </em>\u00bf* <em>H. R. Mayo, </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b131-3\">The judge <footnotemark>*</footnotemark> ruled that the evidence offered was incompetent and immaterial and excluded it; to which ruling the defendant excepted.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-4\">The only question is whether the evidence was admissible. It was not admissible upon the question of the due care of the intestate because the lack of due care on his part was not material, the statute being of a penal nature. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Boston &amp; Lowell Railroad, </em>134 Mass. 211. <em>Merrill </em>v. <em>Eastern </em>Railroad, 139 Mass. 252. <em>Hudson </em>v. <em>Lynn &amp; Boston Railroad, </em>185 Mass. 510. Nor was it admissible to prove the terms of the contract of carriage. It had no tendency to prove that the intestate was not a passenger. The defendant could not by a contract made in advance exempt itself from the penalties of the statute. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Vermont &amp; Massachusetts Railroad, </em>108 Mass. 7. <em>Boyle </em>v. <em>Fitchburg Railroad, </em>162 Mass. 66, 71. See also <em>Hudson </em>v. <em>Lynn &amp; Boston Railroad, ubi supra, </em>and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">Nor was it admissible upon the question of the degree of culpability. It had no bearing as to any physical circumstance to which the accident was in any part due nor upon the degree of care due from the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-6\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b131-10\"> <em>Fox, </em>J.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
