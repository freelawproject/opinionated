He then testified that the defendant did read it \u201c kind of loud,\u201d but that lie could not understand it; that the defendant told him nothing about the new agreement but simply asked him to sign it; and that he had no idea why he signed the new agreement or gave up the first one. On redirect examination the plaintiff testified that the defendant read the new agreement to the defendant\u2019s bookkeeper; that he could understand him reading it, but testified, \u201cThere was no use in my understanding it when I didn\u2019t know anything about it.\u201d In answer to a question whether the defendant read the agreement so that the plaintiff knew the contents of it, the plaintiff said, \u201c Of course, if I had any understanding about it, or if I was in any way smart or intelligent, I suppose I would have understood it; but. I didn\u2019t.\u201d On re-cross-examination the plaintiff testified that he could not say whether the defendant read the new agreement to him or to the defendant\u2019s bookkeeper, and could not say whether the bookkeeper read it to him. There was nothing in the other testimony which added to these statements. <em>Held, </em>that there was no evidence to he submitted to the jury that the plaintiff\u2019s signature to the second agreement had been procured by fraud on the part of the defendant, and that a verdict should have been ordered for the defendant.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b181-5\">Where at a trial under a declaration in contract or tort, the plaintiff upon the state of facts disclosed by the evidence could not recover upon any count of his declaration without showing fraud on the part of the defendant, and there was no evidence of such fraud to submit to the jury, but the presiding judge refused to order a verdict for the defendant and the jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff, upon an exception by the defendant to sucli refusal, this court under St. 1909, c. 236, ordered an entry in the trial court of judgment for the defendant.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b181-6\">Contract or tort for the sum of $400 paid by the plaintiff to the defendant as a deposit under an agreement in writing dated June 17, 1907, by which the defendant agreed to sell to the plaintiff and the plaintiff agreed to purchase from the defendant a lot of land with a frame dwelling house thereon numbered 287 on West Fifth Street in that part of Boston called South Boston; with three counts, the first alleging fraud on the part of the defendant, the second alleging the conversion by the defendant of $400, the property of the plaintiff, and the third alleging that the defendant owed the plaintiff $400 received by the defendant to the plaintiff\u2019s use.

It appeared that a second agreement of the same date between the defendant and the plaintiff for the sale and purchase of the same house and lot on different terms was signed by the plaintiff and that the first agreement was returned by the plaintiff to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>defendant and subsequently was destroyed. The plaintiff contended that the second agreement was obtained from him by fraud on the part of the defendant, and the case was submitted to the jury on this issue.

The contention made by the plaintiff in argument was that the action of the defendant under the circumstances was a representation that this second agreement represented or contained the terms which formerly had been agreed upon, that this representation was false and fraudulent, and that it was this representation that induced the plaintiff to sign the second agreement. But the plaintiff\u2019s testimony does not support this contention. He first testified that the defendant did not read the new agreement aloud to him, but asked him to sign it; then that the defendant did read it \u201ckind of loud,\u201d but that he (the plaintiff) \u201c couldn\u2019t understand it \u201d; that the defendant told him nothing about the new agreement but simply asked him to sign it; that he had no idea why he signed the new agreement or gave up the first one. On redirect examination, he said that Corbett read the new agreement to the defendant\u2019s bookkeeper, that he (the plaintiff) could understand him reading it, but \u201c there was no use of my understanding it when I didn\u2019t know anything about it.\u201d In answer to a question whether the defendant read the agreement so that he (the plaintiff) knew the contents of it, he said: \u201c Of course if I had any understanding about it, or if I was in any way smart or intelligent, I suppose I would have understood it; but I didn\u2019t.\u201d On re-cross-examination he testified that he could not say whether the defendant read the new agreement to him (the plaintiff) or to the defendant\u2019s bookkeeper, and could not say whether the bookkeeper read it to him. We find nothing in the testimony of the other witnesses or in the plaintiff\u2019s testimony when called in rebuttal which adds anything to these statements. Manifestly this testimony would not justify a finding that such a fraud as is claimed had been practised upon him by the defendant. There was no representation and nothing. to indicate a representation by the defendant that the second agreement represented or contained the same terms which formerly had been agreed upon and had been embodied in the first agreement. Accordingly, upon the contention made at the trial the defendant\u2019s first request should have been given; and the defendant\u2019s exceptions must be sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">The defendant asks us now, under the provisions of St. 1909, c. 286, to direct the entry in the Superior Court of judgment in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>his favor. Under the circumstances we are of opinion that this ought to be done. Most of the false representations averred in the first count of the declaration, the only one which dealt with the subject, were not relied on at the trial, and there was no evidence of the only fraud which was relied on. And the plaintiff could not recover upon any count of his declaration, upon the state of facts which appeared at the trial, without proof of actual fraud on the part of the defendant. The entry must be</p>\n<p id=\"AS4\">\n<em>Exceptions sustained; judgment to be entered for the defendant.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
