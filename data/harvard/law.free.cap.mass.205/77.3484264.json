The evidence of the defendant contradicted that of the plaintiff. No such memorandum as that testified to by the plaintiff\u2019s witnesses was produced by the defendant, but the defendant did produce a paper purporting to be signed by the plaintiff by which he acknowledged the receipt of \u201c wages in full, medical attendance, and \u00a7100 settlement in full.\u201d The defendant\u2019s agent testified that the plaintiff signed such paper and that it was the only one that he did sign. The plaintiff\u2019s witnesses denied that the plaintiff signed it. At the close of the evidence the defendant asked that all of the evidence as to the oral agreement made between the plaintiff and the defendant\u2019s agent be stricken out. The presiding judge refused to order that the evidence be stricken out, and instructed the jury that, if the negotiations resulted in a written agreement between the parties, the action could not be maintained. The jury found for the plaintiff. <em>Held, </em>that the evidence warranted a finding that the agreement between the parties liad not been reduced to writing, that the jury must have found so, and therefore that the ruling asked for by the defendant was refused rightly.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b99-7\">Contract with a declaration which, as amended, alleged in substance that the defendant, in consideration of the plaintiff\u2019s forbearing to sue the defendant for injuries alleged to have been sustained by him through the defendant\u2019s negligence, agreed to pay the plaintiff $100 and his wages amounting to $16.87 per week \u201c from the time of his injury until he should be perfectly well from said injury and able to return to work,\u201d and that, after paying the wages for several months, the defendant repudiated the agreement, denied that it had made it, and refused to pay anything further.

According to the evidence put in for the plaintiff, Bennett then wrote out what purported to be a statement or memorandum of this agreement, and asked the plaintiff, who could not read English, to sign it, which the plaintiff either did or began to do. But the plaintiff\u2019s son, who was present, observed that this paper did not contain the agreement for the future payment of wages, and told the plaintiff not to sign it. Thereupon this paper was torn up and burned by Bennett, and he (Bennett) wrote another paper which did contain that stipulation and which the plaintiff signed and gave to Bennett and received from Bennett a check for the $100 which was to be paid down. Bennett\u2019s testimony contradicted this, but it was for the jury to say what they would believe.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-7\">The defendant produced a paper purporting to be signed by the plaintiff under the name of Peter Pratt, and to be witnessed by the plaintiff\u2019s son and by Bennett, by which the plaintiff acknowledged the receipt from the defendant of his \u201c wages in full, medical attendance, and $100 settlement in full for all claims on account of an accident to person or property.\u201d Bennett testified that the plaintiff signed this, that the plaintiff\u2019s son and Bennett signed it as witnesses, and that this was the only paper which was signed and delivered to him at the time of the settlement. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>The defendant put in also evidence of the genuineness of the signatures of the plaintiff and his son upon this paper. But the plaintiff and his son both testified that this paper was not the one which they had signed, and that the signature which the plaintiff had made was Pierre Laprade and not Peter Pratt. There was evidence that after this settlement had been made, the defendant did for about a year pay to the plaintiff his weekly wages without his doing any work; and there was contradictory evidence as to whether he had recovered from his injuries. There was no dispute that the paper which the plaintiff had executed had gone into the possession of Bennett.</p>\n<p id=\"AqT\">Manifestly upon this evidence the jury might find that the agreement between the parties had not been reduced to writing. We cannot ourselves weigh the probabilities and undertake to say what their finding ought to have been. <em>Marvel </em>v. <em>Cobb, </em>204 Mass. 117. <em>Electric Welding Co. </em>v. <em>Prince, </em>200 Mass. 386, 392. <em>Hayes </em>v. <em>Moulton, </em>194 Mass. 157, 163. They might accept the testimony of the plaintiff and his son, and find that he had not executed the paper produced by the defendant; they might find on the testimony of Bennett, that he. executed no other paper, and so conclude that there was no written agreement. Or they might find that the paper produced by the defendant was the one which the plaintiff testified that he first signed or began to sign, that Bennett had not destroyed this, but had substituted for it some other paper and destroyed that instead; and that either the plaintiff had signed no other paper, or that Bennett had not accepted the paper which the plaintiff did sign, but had suppressed or destroyed it. But in this event there would be no written agreement between the parties; the first paper had not become an agreement and was not binding upon the plaintiff because he had not delivered it as an agreement; and the second, if there was one, had not taken effect as an agreement because the defendant or Bennett in its behalf had not accepted it.</p>\n<p id=\"Aah\">We are of opinion accordingly that the judge did not err in allowing the jury to consider the evidence of the conversation between Bennett and the plaintiff. That conversation itself, the jury could find, constituted the agreement between the parties, as no question seems to have been raised as to Bennett\u2019s author<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>ity. The case does not fall within the rule of <em>Budro </em>v. Burgess, 197 Mass. 74.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">The defendant has not argued its other exception. Indeed, the judge instructed the jury that if the consultations and oral neg\u00f3tiations of the parties resulted in a written agreement which in-eluded the whole agreement and was the agreement between the parties, the action could not be maintained. The jury must have found that there was no such written agreement, and that made most of the other questions immaterial.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-12\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
