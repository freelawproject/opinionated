In this case, however, since it seemed that the issue had been fully tried, and that the plaintiff had a right to enforce a lien obtained by a levy on the interest of the judgment debtor in the real estate after judgment, though not on the interest which was attached in the action at law, the plaintiff was given an opportunity to apply in the court where the bill was filed for leave to amend his bill so as properly to set forth that right, and it was ordered that, if such amendment was allowed, a decree, which had been made for the plaintiff and from which the defendant had appealed, should stand.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b464-7\">On an appeal by a defendant from a decree of the Superior Court in a suit in equity, after a rescript had been sent which permitted the plaintiff to apply for leave to amend his bill so as to state grounds for relief in accordance with the facts which were found, and which directed that, if such amendment was allowed, a decree which had been entered for the plaintiff and from which the defendant had appealed should stand, one of several defendants filed in this court a motion that the case be sent back to the Superior Court for a rehearing, and, all parties having been heard in writing on the motion and it appearing that certain facts, which would be material whether the bill was amended or not, had not been called sufficiently to the attention of the trial court and had not appeared in the record which was before this court, the rescript was recalled, the decree of the Superior Court was revoked, and the case was remanded to that court for further hearing, either on the bill as it stood or as it might be amended by leave of that court.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b465-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>Bill in equity, filed in the Superior Court on July 31, 1908, by Carleton Hunneman and the United Surety Company (hereinafter called the surety company) against the Lowell Institution for Savings (hereinafter called the savings bank) and Delia C. Phelps, alleging in substance that the plaintiff Carleton Hunneman on January 19, 1905, commenced an action against the defendant Delia C. Phelps and caused an attachment to be made of her real estate in the county of Suffolk to the amount of $2,500; that a default against the defendant Phelps was entered in said action, which subsequently was removed by order of the court upon the defendant Phelps\u2019s giving a bond with the United Surety Company as surety in the penal sum of $2,000 conditioned upon her paying to the plaintiff any judgment which he might recover in the action, but that the attachment upon the defendant\u2019s real estate was not dissolved; that on June 1, 1908, Hunneman recovered a judgment <footnotemark>*</footnotemark> amounting to $1,714.37 which the surety company paid, <em>\u201c </em>and by virtue of such payment became subrogated to all the rights of said Hunneman against said Phelps under said execution, and that further said execution was assigned to your petitioner United Surety Company by said Hunneman, the same at that time being satisfied in no part whatever by the defendant Phelps \u201d; that the assignment gave to the surety company the right to collect the amount of the judgment from the defendant Phelps in Hunneman\u2019s name; that when the defendant Phelps procured the surety company to give the bond, she deposited with it $1,036.27 which had been applied toward paying the plaintiff Hunneman, and that there was still due to the surety company, because of what it paid to the plaintiff Hunneman and of expenses which it had incurred, $898.10 \u201c and further costs of collection \u201d ; that the defendant Lowell Institution for Savings held mortgages upon the real estate of the defendant Phelps in the county of Suffolk which were entitled to priority over the attachments of the plaintiff Hunneman, that the bank by a sale under the mortgages on July 28, 1908, foreclosed the mortgages and that it had in its possession a surplus; that within thirty days after the rendition of the judgment in the case of Hunneman <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number><em>v. </em>Phelps and previous to the foreclosure sale a deputy sheriff of Suffolk County had commenced a levy under the execution, which \u201c levy had not been completed.\u201d The plaintiffs\u2019 statement of their legal conclusions from the facts alleged is in the opinion. The prayers of the bill were in substance that the savings bank be enjoined from paying the surplus in its hands to the defendant Phelps, that an accounting be had as to the amount of the surplus, and that the interest of the defendant Phelps in the surplus be determined and the bank be ordered to\u2022 pay to the surety company \u201cthe share of\u201d the defendant Phelps, \u201cor so much thereof as may be sufficient to satisfy said execution and the costs of this bill.\u201d There also was a prayer for general relief.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b466-3\">The defendants demurred.

Indeed the appellant does not argue to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-10\">The execution having been placed in the officer\u2019s hands within thirty days from the judgment, the surety company had its choice either to levy upon the interest attached upon mesne process or to seize afresh on the execution. The officer\u2019s return shows <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>that upon the execution he \u201c seized and took \u201d all the right, title and interest which the judgment debtor \u201c had (not exempt by law from attachment or levy on execution) on the thirtieth day of June, A. D. 1908, at thirty minutes past ten o\u2019clock A.M. (being the time the same was taken on execution) in and to the\u201d real estate in question. It thus clearly appears that the levy was begun not upon the interest attached upon mesne process, but upon the interest existing at the time of the beginning of the levy. Several days before the foreclosure sale the right under the attachment was irretrievably lost. The right of the surety company therefore depends upon the interest acquired by the seizure upon execution of the right existing at the time of the seizure.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-3\">By this seizure the surety company secured an interest in the land. By the foreclosure sale under the power contained in the mortgage held by the bank, this interest was turned into money. Under these circumstances the surety company had an equitable lien upon the proceeds, a right which equity will enforce if the right be promptly pursued. The money in the hands of the bank belonged to the same persons as the land before the sale. For illustration of the application of this principle see <em>Wiggin </em>v. Heywood, 118 Mass. 514, and cases cited ; <em>Worcester </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>179 Mass. 41; <em>Knowles </em>v. <em>Sullivan, </em>182 Mass. 318. For a discussion of the principle and its limitations and exceptions see among other cases <em>Gardner </em>v. Barnes, 106 Mass. 505, <em>Judge </em>v. <em>Herbert, </em>124 Mass. 330, and <em>Western Union Telegraph Co. </em>v. <em>Caldwell, </em>141 Mass. 489. The foreclosure sale took place July 28,1908. The very next day the bill was filed. The surety company has therefore an equitable lien upon the proceeds of the sale, such lien being junior to all claims upon the land at the time the levy began.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-4\">It does not clearly appear from the facts found whether after satisfying such claims there is anything left for the petitioner. The trial judge seems to have been of opinion that the proceedings of the levy related back to the time of the attachment and not to the time of the seizure upon the execution, for he has found the incumbrances upon the property at the former time but says nothing about those at the latter time. In view, however, of the large surplus which came to the hands of the bank as the pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>eeeds of the sale, and of the fact that the bank seems satisfied with the decree of the Superior Court, we infer that, no matter what may be the time at which the incumbrances are considered, there is enough left to pay the surety company.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-4\">It is urged by the appellant that it appears that several attachments were made subsequent to that of the plaintiff, and they are not shown to have been dissolved. In his return the officer states that after seizing the real estate on execution he suspended the levy by reason of prior attachments, and that \u201c on the second day of July, 1908, the prior attachments above referred to having been disposed of,\u201d he proceeded with his levy. ISTeitlier in the answer of the bank or in that of the appellant is there anything said about these attachments; nor does it appear that at the trial their existence was relied upon or was even suggested as a ground of defense. It is true that the answer of the appellant sets up, and the master finds, that there was an attachment made by one Redding before that made by Hunneman, but the trial judge finds that there is enough to satisfy the present claim. It is to be assumed under the circumstances that the other attachments no longer exist.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">The only ground of the demurrer argued before us is that there is a misjoinder of plaintiffs. But that is untenable. Although where the assignment is absolute on its face and its validity is not questioned there is no necessity that the assignor should be a party, yet where it cannot be known in advance whether or not the validity of the assignment, even although absolute on its face, will be questioned, or where there remains a right or liability of the assignor which may be affected by the decree, it is well that the assignor should be a party in order that the rights of all parties, especially the defendant, may be protected by the final decree. It manifestly could not be known in advance that the validity of this assignment would not be questioned; and indeed its validity and effect as an assignment seem to have been actually in dispute at the trial. For a discussion of the law upon this point see <em>Montague </em>v. Lobdell, 11 Cush. 111; <em>Jenkins </em>v. Eliot, 192 Mass. 474, and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-6\">It is insisted by the appellant that the bill places the case of the plaintiffs upon the right secured by the attachment, and inasmuch as that right was not levied upon and is lost, the bill in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>its present form cannot be maintained. This contention seems sound. The bill sets out the attachment, judgment and execution, and then avers that \u201c within thirty days of the rendition of said judgment \u201d the execution was placed \u201c in the hands of . . . [an officer] . . . who commenced levy on the same \u201d; and further that \u201cby reason of the before-mentioned attachment\u201d a lien was acquired by Hunneman upon the real estate, and that by his assignment \u201csaid lien passed with the execution to\u201d the surety company. It is plain that the bill proceeds upon the theory that the right of the surety company to an equitable lien on the proceeds of the foreclosure sale is based upon the right secured by the attachment. But that right we have seen was not levied upon. The case of the surety company, so far as based upon that right, must fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-3\">Nor is the case of the plaintiffs helped by the stipulation entered into by the savings bank, because that only binds the bank to pay whatever it shall be found \u201c chargeable with or answerable for under or by virtue of the attachment in the original action, ... as set forth in the bill of complaint.\u201d It cannot be held to apply to the case proved. It follows that the bill in its present form cannot be maintained.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-4\">But after all the case stands upon the right seized on the execution, whether or not that be the right secured by attachment. The case seems to have been fully tried. No rights intervening between the time of the attachment and the seizure on execution appear to be outstanding except certain rights of the bank arising out of a loan made subsequent to the attachment, and there is nothing to show that there is not enough to satisfy that and also the claim in suit. Under these circumstances we think that the plaintiffs should have an opportunity to apply to the Superior Court for leave to amend the bill, upon such terms as may seem to that court just and reasonable, so as to cover the case proved. If within thirty days such an amendment be allowed, then the decree appealed from shall stand. Otherwise the bill is to be dismissed with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-5\"><em>So </em>ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-6\">After the foregoing opinion was delivered and a rescript had been sent down in accordance therewith, the counsel for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>Lowell Institution for Savings made a motion that the case be sent back to the Superior Court for a rehearing. In support of that motion he stated that on April 2 a motion such as was suggested in the opinion was made before the judge of the Superior Court who tried the case and made the final decree ; and that at the hearing upon that' motion it appeared that certain facts, which would be material -whether the bill was amended or not, had not been sufficiently called to the attention of the trial court and did not appear in the record before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">Counsel upon all sides having been heard in writing on the motion that the case be sent back to the trial court, and it appearing that there was a mistrial there and that the ends of justice require a rehearing, the rescript heretofore issued is recalled, the final decree of the Superior Court is reversed, and the case is remanded to that court for further hearing upon the bill as it now stands, or as it may be amended, \u2014 such amendments only to be made as shall be permitted by that court, and upon such terms as it may prescribe.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
