I am going to read this in terms as I did the other. 1 Was the instrument procured through the fraud or undue influence of Emma F. Whitcomb ? \u2019 Emma F. Whitcomb, of course, is Mrs. Whitcomb. Fraud or undue influence is the allegation which is contained there. If a wife should ask her husband to leave her some property in his will that would be influence, but it rvould be proper influence. It is not influence of that kind which is meant when an affirmative defense is set up that a will is procured by fraud or undue influence. Undue influence is influence which paralyzes the will of the testator and substitutes for his will the will of the person who exercises the influence. It is that kind of influence which is undue influence. It is coupled in this issue, with the word 1 fraud.\u2019 \u2018 Fraud or undue influence.\u2019 It is coupled with the word \u2018 fraud \u2019 because it partakes of the nature of fraud.- An influence which does not partake of the nature of fraud is not undue influence. An influence which paralyzes the will of the testator, no matter by what means, is undue influence. It is true, as both counsel have said, that you always \u2014 I think I may say \u2014 have to make out undue influence by circumstantial evidence, \u2014 by inference; but the undue influence which you-have to make out by inference is something that is in the nature of a fraud; by paralyzing the will of the testator, or substituting the will of the person who exercises the influence and gets him to sign a will which is not his will is in itself in the nature of a fraud. Now, that is what fraud or undue influence means in this issue. To make it out you must be satisfied that the person upon whom the influence was attempted to be exercised was a person who could be influenced. Secondly, that undue influence was in fact exercised, and thirdly, that it was successful so that as a result the paper signed by the testator was the will of the person who exercised the influence and not the will of the testator himself.\u201d \u25a0</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b334-5\">At the end of the charge the appellant took the following exception: \u201c I desire an exception to that portion of the charge which states that undue influence must savor of fraud and that portion of your charge in connection with that.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b334-6\">To the first and third issues the jury answered \u201c yes,\u201d finding that the testator was of sound mind when he executed the will <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>and the codicil; to the second and fourth issues the jury-answered \u201c no.\u201d The appellant alleged the above exception.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b335-5\"><em>E.

D. 81. <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Calvert, </em>5 Gill &amp; J. 269. <em>Stewart </em>v. <em>Elliott, </em>2 Mackey, 307.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-9\">But even if we should say that for this reason the charge of the justice went too far as an abstract proposition, we could not sustain these exceptions. The bill of exceptions merely states as to this question that at the trial \u201c there was evidence tending to show that the execution of the will was procured through the fraud or undue influence of Emma F. Whitcomb.\u201d There is a similar statement as to the execution of the codicil and nothing more. All of this evidence may have related to undue influence exerted by fraudulent devices, and so the charge of the justice may have been exactly appropriate to the state of the evidence before the jury. If that be so, no injury could have been done to the contestant. But it is always incumbent upon the excepting party to show that he was aggrieved or injured by the ruling to which he alleges exception. <em>Chandler </em>v. <em>Jamaica Pond Aqueduct, </em>125 Mass. 544. <em>Linton </em>v. <em>Allen, </em>154 Mass. 432, 440. <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Jagoe, </em>172 Mass. 538. But we prefer to consider the general question.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-10\">In our opinion, the procuring of the execution of a will by means of undue influence is an act which partakes of the nature of a fraud, an act which necessarily imports at least a constructive fraud upon the party upon whom it is practised. This is of course so if the undue influence is, as will often be the case, gained or exercised through any active deception or fraud, so that the deception is itself an essential element of the undue influence. But even when this is not the case, when there is merely such a dominating and controlling influence exerted over the mind and will of the testator by means of excessive importunity or of the mastery which one mind may sometimes gain over a weaker one, yet the object which is consciously sought and gained is to lead the testator to make a will which is differ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>ent from the one he otherwise would have made, which is not the expression of his own desires, but which is dictated to him and imposed upon him by the person who thus influences him, which, as was said of the will of King Edward the Sixth of England, may be his testament, but is the will of the person who has thus dominated his mind and controlled his actions. All that is done in such a case, although no deception may have been practised upon the testator, although he is rather the victim of force than of fraud strictly so called, is done for the sake of palming off as his last will that which is not really such. It is a fraudulent purpose that is aimed at; and the guilty purpose stamps with its own character all the means which are employed for its attainment. This is none the less a fraud upon the testator, by causing him to make different dispositions of his property from those which otherwise he would have made, that it is also a fraud upon his heirs or those whom he would have made the objects of his bounty, even though the pecuniary loss may fall wholly upon the latter.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-3\">This court has already taken the view which we have stated. In <em>Phillips </em>v. Chase, 203 Mass. 556, the undue influence by which the respondent had induced his wife to address her petition to the Probate Court was merely a moral coercion exerted over her. There was neither allegation nor evidence that any deception had been practised upon her to lead her to do as she did. She was simply forced to act against her will. It was held (p. 560) that this was like the case of undue influence practised upon a testator, and (p. 563) that the act of so dominating his wife\u2019s will as to force her against her will to bring the petition was \u201c a gross fraud upon his wife \u201d as well as a fraud upon the court to which the petition was presented as her voluntary act. That case is decisive of the principle here stated. So it was said by Hoar, J., in <em>Baldwin </em>v. Parker, 99 Mass. 79, 84: \u201c The objection to a will that it was obtained by undue influence is not one which it is easy to define \"with precision. The term seems to include both fraud and coercion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b336-4\">The weight of authority in other jurisdictions is to the same effect. In many cases it is said that undue influence is a species of fraud, or that it partakes of the nature of fraud. <em>Barry </em>v. <em>Butlin, </em>1 Curt. 637, 647. <em>Mackall </em>v.

And see <em>Shailer </em>v. <em>Bumstead, </em>99 Mass. 112, 121; <em>Woodbury </em>v. <em>Woodbury, </em>141 Mass. 329; <em>Maynard </em>v. Tyler, 168 Mass. 107, 114; <em>Bacon </em>v. <em>Bacon, </em>181 Mass. 18, 22; <em>Boyse </em>v. <em>Rossborough, </em>6 H. L. Cas. 2; <em>Kinleside </em>v. Harrison, 2 Phillim. 449, 451; <em>Barnes </em>v. <em>Barnes, </em>66 Maine, 286; <em>Marx </em>v. <em>McGlynn, </em>88 N. Y. 357, 370; <em>Eckert </em>v. <em>Flowry, </em>43 Penn. St. 46, 52; <em>Schofield </em>v. Walker, 58 Mich. 96; In re <em>Jackman, </em>26 Wis. 104, 113; <em>In re Darst\u2019s Will, </em>34 Ore. 58, 65; Turner\u2019s Will, 51 Ore. 1, 8; <em>Coghill </em>v. <em>Kennedy, </em>119 Ala. 641; <em>Schieffelin </em>v. <em>Schieffelin, </em>127 Ala. 14; <em>Mullen </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>157 Ala. 262.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">Undoubtedly if in any particular case where fraud or undue influence was alleged there was evidence both of actual deception or fraud practised upon the testator and of a dominating influence over his mind and will gained and exercised without resort to deception or to any underhand devices, it would be necessary by appropriate instructions to bring the attention of the jury to the distinction between these two methods of exerting an undue influence and thus controlling the action of a testator. But this does not appear to have been such a case.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-6\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
