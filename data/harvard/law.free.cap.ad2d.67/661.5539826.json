Judgment modified, on the law and the facts, by (1) increasing the alimony award to $75 per week and the counsel fee to $3,000 and (2) adding thereto a provision that should defendant evict plaintiff from the premises she now occupies at 38 Grove Avenue, New Rochelle, New York, or should plaintiff voluntarily elect to take up residence elsewhere, upon plaintiffs removal from the premises, defendant is to pay her an additional sum of $50 per week as alimony. As so modified, judgment affirmed insofar as appealed from, without costs or disbursements. On the facts of this case, the awards of alimony and counsel fees were inadequate to the extent indicated herein. Defendant correctly asserts that he is entitled to possession of the marital home, of which he and his brother are co-owners. The judgment of divorce does not contain any provision allowing the plaintiff to remain in the premises. However, once plaintiff leaves the residence, she will not have sufficient means to obtain housing consonant with the parties\u2019 previous standard of living. For that reason, the award of alimony should be further increased if and when plaintiff vacates the premises (see <em>Dubno v Dubno, </em>51 AD2d 693). O\u2019Connor, J. P., Shapiro, Cohalan and Margett, JJ., concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
