Steven also appeals the District Court\u2019s denial of his request for post-termination visitation with the children. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-5\">\u00b62 Steven raises the following issues on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b51-6\">\u00b63 1. Did the District Court err in terminating the parental rights of Steven?</p>\n<p id=\"b51-7\">\u00b64 2. Did the District Court err when it denied Steven visitation with the children after terminating his parental rights?</p>\n<p id=\"b51-8\">\n<em>BACKGROUND</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b51-9\">\u00b65 Shelly is the natural mother of B.A., A.A. and N.A (children), currently ages 7, 4, and 14 respectively. Shelly does not appeal the termination of her parental rights. Ross is the natural father of N.A. Ross did not appear in the District Court nor complete any court-ordered requirements. Ross does not appeal the termination of his parental rights. Steven is the natural father of B.A. and A.A. Although Steven is not the natural father of N.A., Steven requested that the District Court allow him post-termination visitation and contact with all three children. Shelly and Steven were never married and have had only an intermittent relationship over approximately eight years. Steven has never taken an active role in parenting the children.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-10\">\u00b66 The Department first became involved with Shelly\u2019s children in early 1990 and substantiated a report of physical neglect related to her severe intoxication. In 1991, the Department documented a second, similar incident involving physical neglect, excessive use of alcohol, and interpersonal problems with family members. Five years later, in 1996, the Department received four additional reports of physical abuse by Shelly. Subsequent to the fourth report, the Department removed the children from Shelly\u2019s home and placed the children in foster care. Shortly thereafter, the children were returned to Shelly\u2019s care with family based services for ninety days. In December 1996, Shelly stipulated and agreed to consent to the Department\u2019s Petition for Temporary Investigative Authority and Protective Services (TIA).</p>\n<p id=\"Auq\">\u00b67 The Department again became involved with Shelly in March <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>1997, and again placed N.A. and B.A. in licensed foster care because of another incident of severe intoxication. The District Court continued the Department\u2019s TLA through June 1997. It granted temporary legal custody (TLC) to the Department in that same month. The children were again returned to Shelly\u2019s home with family based services in May 1998. The District Court subsequently dismissed the TLC in September 1998.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-4\">\u00b68 The Department did not become involved with Shelly and her children again until February 1999 when both the Department and the Miles City Police Department responded to a call of possible domestic abuse between Shelly and her Mend Sam. Because of her condition, Shelly was admitted to Deaconess Psychiatric Center for the third time in March 1999. Also in March, because of concern that Shelly\u2019s condition did not make it possible for her to properly take care of the children, Shelly\u2019s mother and stepfather took the children to their home in Mobridge, South Dakota.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-5\">\u00b69 In July 1999, the Miles City Police Department charged Shelly with a DUI and careless driving after she became severely intoxicated and drove her car over a dike. Because of her condition, the Police Department transported Shelly to Deaconess Psychiatric Center. By August 1999, the Department had begun working in conjunction with Shelly\u2019s therapist in an attempt to stabilize Shelly\u2019s living situation.</p>\n<p id=\"Aan\">\u00b610 By October, Shelly was seeing her therapist and taking her medications on a regular basis. She obtained appropriate housing and felt she was stable enough to begin parenting her children again. She thus went to Mobridge to pick up the children from her mother and stepfather and returned with them to Miles City.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-6\">\u00b611 The Department thereafter attempted to provide the developmental assessment, educational, and support services necessary to keep the children safely in Shelly\u2019s home, including arranging and paying for daycare and enrolling B.A. in the Headstart program. However, on October 21, 1999, the Miles City Police Department arrested Kurt Kiltie, a Mend of Shelly, and charged him with a DUI. B.A. was found in his vehicle. After an investigation, the Department determined that Shelly had known that Kiltie had been drinking all day when she allowed four-year-old B.A. to ride in the car with him.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-7\">\u00b612 In January 2000, Shelly did not allow the Department to transport A.A. to an evaluation that had been planned weeks in advance. The Department also received another report of physical abuse of B.A. by Shelly and two additional reports of A.A.\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>developmental delays and lack of routine medical care. After further investigation of these reports, the Department removed the children from Shelly\u2019s home and placed them in foster care.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-4\">\u00b613 The Department filed its petition for TLC on January 18, 2000. Both Shelly and Steven were present at the scheduled hearing. The minutes of the hearing reflect that the parties reached an agreement wherein Shelly and Steven stipulated to temporary legal custody of the children. The record reflects, however, that Steven did not sign the written stipulation. The Department requested a continuance of TLC on October 6,2000. Shelly attended the November 9 hearing with her attorney. Steven, although legally served, did not attend the hearing and did not sign his court-ordered treatment plan. Shelly again stipulated to temporary legal custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-5\">\u00b614 The Department again petitioned for continuance of TLC on February 9, 2001. In an affidavit attached to the petition, Tere Gabel (Gabel), a social worker with the Department, stated that she had sent three letters to Steven, on December 4 and 14, 2000, and on January 8, 2001, requesting that Steven come to Gabel\u2019s office to discuss his court-ordered treatment plan. Steven eventually met with Gabel on January 9,2001, and January 12,2001. According to Gabel\u2019s affidavit, Steven stated that he did not feel he could parent the children, even with the help of Shelly, but that he does want to visit the children on occasion. The affidavit also noted that Steven was comfortable with the children being in foster care and that he did not feel he could complete the court-ordered treatment plan. Steven had not to that point requested any visitation with the children.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-6\">\u00b615 On March 12, 2001, two days prior to the hearing on the Department\u2019s motion to extend TLC, Steven filed a motion with the court for visitation of B. A. andA.A., asking to see them every weekend, every other holiday, and one-half of the summer. After the March 14 hearing, at which Shelly and Steven were both present with counsel, the District Court ordered, in part, that Steven should exercise supervised visitation. Steven signed the treatment plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-7\">\u00b616 The District Court also adjudicated the children as youths in need of care, finding by a preponderance of the evidence that dismissal of the petition would create a substantial risk of harm to the children or be a detriment to the children\u2019s physical or psychological well-being. It also ordered that Steven complete a treatment plan in an attempt to address his mental and emotional stability issues and parenting deficiencies and to provide him with the necessary skills to provide for the children\u2019s physical, emotional and medical needs. The treatment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>plan required Steven to participate in medical and psychological evaluations, maintain an adequate home environment, maintain income from employment, attend counseling, maintain regular visitation with his children pursuant to a visitation agreement, and maintain weekly contact with his counselor.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-4\">\u00b617 The Department filed a petition for permanent legal custody and termination of parental rights with right to consent to adopt on Jun\u00e9 14,2001. The petition cited Steven\u2019s failure to obtain a medical and/or psychological diagnosis and treatment through a physician or psychologist, failure to attend family/individual counseling sessions, failure to follow his counselor\u2019s recommendations, and failure to maintain weekly contact with his social worker.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-5\">\u00b618 Steven filed a second motion for visitation of B.A. and A.A. on August 3, 2001. The brief states that, \u201calthough Steven himself feels he may be inadequate to be the custodial parent of these children, he does want significant visitation of the children.\u201d Steven argued in the brief that Shelly had interfered with his attempted visitation and that he had not been allowed any meaningful visitation by the Department.</p>\n<p id=\"Arr\">\u00b619 The Department objected to Steven\u2019s motion, noting that it was seeking termination of Steven\u2019s parental rights, that Steven had open visitation but failed to avail himself of the opportunity, that Steven failed to appear at his last scheduled visitation and that Steven had requested no further visitation with the children after missing his previous scheduled visitation. The court-appointed special advocate, Toni Gaglia, reported to the court on December 13, 2001, that Steven had made no request for visitation to the Department since June 10, 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-6\">\u00b620 The District Court held its termination hearing on December 13 and 14, 2001. By that time, B.A. and A.A. had been in foster care for a period of 24 months. Steven was not present at the December 13 hearing because he had begun a new medication and was \u201creal anxious.\u201d The District Court entered its findings of fact, conclusions of law and order on February 5,2001, terminating Shelly\u2019s, Steven\u2019s, and Ross\u2019s parental rights to the children and granting permanent legal custody of B.A. and A.A. to the Department with authority to consent to adoption. The District Court appointed N.A.\u2019s maternal grandmother, Linda, as guardian and conservator of N.A., with the right of the Department to seek termination upon proper petition to the court. The District Court denied Steven\u2019s request for post-termination supervised visitation of B.A. and A.A., concluding that it would be unfair and not in the best interests of B.A. or A.A. to continue <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>supervised visitation after termination of Steven\u2019s parental rights.</p>\n<p id=\"A0e\">\u00b621 Steven now appeals the termination of his parental rights and the denial of post-termination visitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-4\">\n<em>STANDARD OF REVIEW</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b55-5\">\u00b622 We review a district court\u2019s decision to terminate parental rights to determine whether the district court abused its discretion. <em>In re E.K., </em>2001 MT 279, \u00b6 31, 307 Mont. 328, \u00b6 31, 37 P.3d 690, \u00b6 31. On review of a decision to terminate parental rights, we determine whether the district court\u2019s findings of fact supporting termination are clearly erroneous. <em>In re B.H., </em>2001 MT 288, \u00b6 13, 307 Mont. 412, \u00b6 13, 37 P.3d 736, \u00b6 13. A finding of fact is clearly erroneous if it is not supported by substantial evidence, if the court misapprehended the effect of the evidence, or if upon on reviewing the record, this Court is left with the definite and firm conviction that the district court made a mistake. <em>In re E.K., </em>\u00b6 31. In reviewing a district court\u2019s conclusions of law, we determine if they are correct. <em>In re </em>E.K., \u00b6 31.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-6\">\u00b623 In determining whether to terminate parental rights, the district court is bound to give primary consideration to the physical, mental, and emotional conditions and needs of the children, thus the best interests of the children are of paramount concern in a parental rights termination proceeding and take precedence over the parental rights. <em>In re E.K., </em>\u00b6 33 (citing <em>In re J.W., </em>2001 MT 86, \u00b6 8, 305 Mont. 149, \u00b6 8, 23 P.3d 916, \u00b6 8). We will presume that a district court\u2019s decision is correct and will not disturb it on appeal unless there is a mistake of law or a finding of fact not supported by substantial evidence that would amount to a clear abuse of discretion. <em>In re E.K., </em>\u00b6 33.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-7\">\n<em>DISCUSSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b55-8\">\u00b624 1. Did the District Court err in terminating the parental rights of Steven?</p>\n<p id=\"b55-9\">\u00b625 The District Court concluded that Steven did not comply with either treatment plan in that he did not attend counseling, failed to maintain consistent contact with his children and voluntarily discontinued visitation altogether. The District Court relied on the testimony of psychologist Dawn Birk, Ph.D, finding that Steven suffered from bipolar disorder with psychotic features and that Steven would unlikely be able to independently care for the children because of his severe mental illness.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-10\">\u00b626 The District Court further relied on Dr. Birk\u2019s testimony that Steven presented as confused and angry, and that Steven\u2019s mental <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>stability could deteriorate rapidly if confronted with the stress of parenting, finally concluding that the children should not be placed in Steven\u2019s care absent supervision.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-4\">\u00b627 The District Court also relied on Steven\u2019s own testimony about his recent problems, including problems with his psycho tropic medication which caused him to be very sick and suicidal. Further, Steven was committed to the Montana State Mental Hospital and was living in a group home at the time of the termination hearing. The District Court relied on Steven\u2019s testimony that he was unable to provide care for his children because of the limitations of his mental health, his living arrangements, and his lack of recent contact with the children.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-5\">\u00b628 The District Court thus concluded that Steven failed to complete his treatment plan and that the condition making him unable to parent his children was unlikely to change within a reasonable time.</p>\n<p id=\"AkV\">\u00b629 On appeal, Steven does not argue that the District Court erred in adjudicating the children as youths in need of care, nor does he challenge the appropriateness of his two treatment plans. Rather, Steven argues that the evidence presented by the Department was insufficient to prove by clear and convincing evidence that he did not complete his treatment plan or that the condition making him unfit to parent is unlikely to change within a reasonable time. Steven contends that the evidence from the Department\u2019s main witness, Dr. Birk, is inconsistent and could be construed as favoring continued contact rather than termination of parental rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-6\">\u00b630  The party seeking to terminate parental rights \u201cmust present clear and convincing evidence to the district court that the prerequisite statutory criteria for termination have been met.\u201d <em>In re M.T., </em>2002 MT 174, \u00b6 26, 310 Mont. 506, \u00b6 26, 51 P.3d 1141, \u00b6 26 (citation omitted). In cases involving the termination of parental rights, clear and convincing proof is simply a requirement that a preponderance of the evidence be definite, clear, and convincing, or that a particular issue must be clearly established by a preponderance of the evidence or by a clear preponderance of proof. This requirement does not call for unanswerable or conclusive evidence. The quality of proof, to be clear and convincing, is somewhere between the rule in ordinary civil cases and the requirement of criminal procedure-that is, it must be more than a mere preponderance but not beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>In re M.T., </em>\u00b6 26 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b56-7\">\u00b631 Steven contends that the evidence did not clearly and convincingly establish noncompliance with the treatment plans, and, notwithstanding admission of his inability to independently parent his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>children, the evidence submitted does not indicate that he is unable to parent when he is \u201cmedically-compliant.\u201d Steven argues that the counseling he received from Dr. Birk satisfied the requirement in his treatment plan that he obtain a medical and/or psychological diagnosis and treatment through a physician or psychologist. Steven also submitted, in May 2001, a certificate of completion for the \u201cIts all about Parenting\u201d series which, he contends, fulfilled the requirement that he complete parenting classes. Steven also notes that he participated in visitation with his children until a relapse of his mental illness in June 2001, at a time when his doctors were in the process of changing his medications and when he also quit taking his medication for a short time, causing him to become sick and suicidal.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-4\">\u00b632 Steven characterizes the testimony of Dr. Birk as testimony that \u201cmay be based on conjecture\u201d because no evidence existed that Steven abused or neglected the children and because the testimony of other witnesses supported a finding that Steven and the children care for each other and wanted to be together, \u201cif not always then at least sometimes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b57-5\">\u00b633 The Department responds that, by Steven\u2019s own admission, he is unable to parent either of his children, he did not comply with the treatment plan\u2019s requirements to maintain weekly contact with his social worker and failed to request further visitation with B.A. and A.A. after voluntarily discontinuing visitation due to illness. The Department also notes that Steven testified at the termination hearing that he knew he could set up visits with the children if he merely requested further visitation from the Department. Steven testified that he did not do so because he \u201cwasn\u2019t in the right frame of mind\u201d when he was having trouble with his medication in June 2001. However, he also testified that he had not yet, as of December, attempted to set up visitation with the children.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-6\">\u00b634 The Department also noted Dr. Birk\u2019s testimony that Steven suffered from severe bipolar disorder and was showing psychotic features, primarily paranoid delusions. Dr. Birk testified that, at the time she evaluated Steven, it was unlikely that he could care for the children due to his severe mental health problems.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-7\">\u00b635 The Guardian <em>ad Litem </em>(Guardian) for the children likewise responds that, by Steven\u2019s own admission, his mental illness made him incapable of being a full-time parent, a role that he admittedly did not want to assume, and that he admittedly failed, due to mental illness, to maintain committed contact with B.A. and A.A. The Guardian also contends that Steven\u2019s psychological evaluation from Dr. Birk did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>satisfy the requirements of the treatment plan because it merely resulted in a diagnosis without further meaningful treatment, essentially arguing that Steven failed to follow Dr. Birk\u2019s recommendations to obtain further medical and/or mental health care.</p>\n<p id=\"Ak8\">\u00b636 Steven\u2019s contention that he did substantially comply with his treatment plan ignores this Court\u2019s long-standing principle that partial compliance or substantial compliance with a treatment plan is insufficient. <em>In the Matter of D.H., </em>2001 MT 200, \u00b6 30, 306 Mont. 278, \u00b6 30, 33 P.3d 616, \u00b6 30 (citing <em>In the Matter of A.N., </em>2000 MT 35, \u00b6 45, 298 Mont. 237, \u00b6 45, 995 P.2d 427, \u00b6 45). The record indicates and Steven concedes that he did not participate in visitation with the children as required by the treatment plan, and that he did not request visitation from the Department even after his mental problems in June 2001, even though conceding he knew the Department would schedule visitation upon request. By Steven\u2019s own admission, he did not maintain weekly contact with his social worker.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-4\">\u00b637 Further, we find compelling the Guardian\u2019s argument that Dr. Birk\u2019s psychological evaluation did not satisfy the requirements of the treatment plan. According to Dr. Birk\u2019s own testimony, she did not anticipate becoming a treatment professional for Steven once the evaluation was completed, but anticipated only the limited involvement required in completing with Steven a brief psychological evaluation. Dr. Birk testified that she recommended to Steven that he become involved in counseling and obtain information relevant to parenting, such as participating in parenting classes.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-5\">\u00b638 At the permanent legal custody hearing, Steven testified that he had started seeing a counselor by the name of Steve Lee and that he felt he should continue in counseling. The record does not demonstrate the extent of this counseling with Steve Lee, whether it was only a single session or more, nor does the record contain any written evaluation or progress report by Mr. Lee. Steven\u2019s testimony merely reflects that he had \u201cstarted\u201d seeing Mr. Lee.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-6\">\u00b639  In light of the above evidence, however, we conclude that the District Court\u2019s determination that Steven did not comply with his treatment plan pursuant to \u00a7 41-3-609(l)(f), MCA, is supported by substantial evidence and is thus, not clearly erroneous. <em>In re B.H., </em>\u00b6 13. By Steven\u2019s own admissions, he did not successfully complete the treatment plan, and we cannot premise error in the District Court simply because Steven may have partially complied with a portion of the treatment plan by beginning counseling sometime near the time of the permanent legal custody hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>\u00b640  Accordingly, we hold that the District Court did not err in concluding that Steven did not comply with the treatment plan and that he, therefore, failed to successfully complete the treatment plan.</p>\n<p id=\"AV6A\">\u00b641 The District Court also received substantial evidence to conclude that Steven\u2019s bipolar disorder and severe mental illness rendering him unfit to parent was unlikely to change within a reasonable time.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-4\">\u00b642 Dr. Birk testified that, at the time she evaluated Steven, it was unlikely that he could care for the children due to his severe mental health problems. Dr. Birk found particularly disconcerting Steven\u2019s confusion about the date of his appointment, confusion about some of the reasons for being involved in a mental health evaluation, and his refusal to allow his attorney to provide Dr. Birk with any information. According to Dr. Birk, Steven was concerned that people were trying to harm him in some way. Accordingly, Dr. Birk testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-5\">And so given his somewhat confused state, as well as his responses to the standardized assessments which suggest a significant degree of anger, I was quite fearful that he might deteriorate very rapidly if he had the children unsupervised and they became unruly and that he wouldn\u2019t be able to handle the situation, which might lead to some type of an abusive-type situation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b59-6\">\u00b643 Dr. Birk recommended further counseling which Steven subsequently failed to successfully complete. Furthermore, Steven\u2019s testimony at the permanent legal custody hearing demonstrated that his condition was not yet resolved or medically controlled when he testified that he did not want to be a full-time parent because he just did not think he was \u201cmentally capable\u201d at that point. Steven was too unstable and \u201canxious\u201d to even attend the first day of the permanent legal custody hearing. As previously noted, the children had already been in foster care for 24 months by the time of the hearing. Steven had been given sufficient time to comply with the treatment plan if he wished to do so. He admittedly did not wish to comply nor did he believe that he could successfully complete the treatment plan because of his mental illness.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-7\">\u00b644  In determining whether the conduct or condition of a parent is unlikely to change within a reasonable time, the court shall enter a finding that continuation of the parent-child legal relationship will likely result in continued abuse or neglect or that the conduct or the condition of a parent renders the parent unfit, unable, or unwilling to give the child adequate parental care. Section 41-3-609(2), MCA; <em>In the Matter of D.H., </em>\u00b6 31.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>\u00b645 In making such determination, the court shall consider the emotional illness, mental illness, or mental deficiency of the parent and consider whether the duration or nature of the illness or deficiency will render the parent unlikely to care for the ongoing physical, mental, and emotional needs of the child within a reasonable time. Section 41-3-609(2)(a), MCA. In weighing the competing interests of parent and child, the court must give primary consideration to the physical, mental, and emotional conditions and needs of the child. Section 41-3-609(3), MCA; <em>In the Matter of D.H., </em>\u00b6 32 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b60-4\">\u00b646  We conclude that the testimony of Dr. Birk, in conjunction with Steven\u2019s own testimony and conduct, provide substantial evidence to support the District Court\u2019s conclusion that Steven\u2019s bipolar disorder and severe mental illness, making him unfit to parent, is a condition unlikely to change within a reasonable time. The District Court correctly concluded that the physical, mental, and emotional conditions and needs of the children would be best served by the termination of Steven\u2019s parental rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-5\">\u00b647 Accordingly, we hold that the District Court did not err in terminating Steven\u2019s parental rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-6\">\u00b648 2. Did the District Court err when it denied Steven visitation with the children after terminating his parental rights?</p>\n<p id=\"b60-7\">\u00b649 Steven argues that \u00a7 41-3-445(5), MCA, provides legal authority for the District Court to allow visitation for a parent whose rights are terminated. Subsection (5) provides in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b60-8\">In its discretion, the court may enter any other order that it determines to be in the best interests of the child that does not conflict with the options provided in subsection (6) ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b60-9\">\u00b650 In the matter currently before this Court, we need not analyze whether the granting of visitation to a parent whose parental rights have been terminated conflicts with any portion of subsection (6). Subsection (5) allows a district court discretion to enter any other order that it determines \u201cto be in the best interests\u201d of the children. Accordingly, the District Court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b60-10\">If [Steven] cannot provide stability, continuity and the basic parenting skill that his children need, it is unfair to the children to continue his parental rights with supervised visitation. [B.A. and A.A.] deserve a meaningful relationship with a parent who can provide physical, emotional and psychological care giving 100% of the time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b61-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>The best interests of the minor children [B.A. and A.A.], would be best served by the termination of the parent-child legal relationship ... of [Steven].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b61-4\">\u00b651  The District Court considered Steven\u2019s visitation request and, in light of the evidence of Steven\u2019s mental illness, in its discretion denied Steven\u2019s request for post-termination visitation, concluding that such visitation would not be in the best interests of the children. We hold that the District Court did not abuse its discretion in so concluding.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-5\">\u00b652 The decision of the District Court is affirmed accordingly.</p>\n<judges id=\"b61-6\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES TRIEWEILER, LEAPHART and REGNIER concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
