The District Court denied Moore\u2019s petition and Moore appeals. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-7\">\u00b62 The sole issue on appeal is whether the District Court erred when it denied Moore\u2019s petition for reinstatement of his driver\u2019s license.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-8\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b149-9\">\u00b63 On December 28, 2001, Montana Highway Patrol Officer Chris Costello was driving his patrol car eastbound on Interstate 90 near the Montana Avenue interchange in Butte, Montana. Officer Costello observed an eastbound vehicle, approximately one half mile in front of him, veer off of the Interstate and strike the guardrail on the shoulder of the right hand lane. Officer Costello maintains that the vehicle did not stop following the collision and, instead, continued to the Harrison Avenue interchange where it exited the Interstate. Officer Costello followed the vehicle and initiated an investigatory stop.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-10\">\u00b64 Upon approaching the vehicle, Officer Costello determined the driver to be the Appellant, Joseph Moore. While talking to Moore about the collision, Officer Costello detected an odor of alcohol emanating from Moore\u2019s person. Officer Costello observed that Moore spoke with a slurred speech and that his eyes were red and glassy. Moore admitted to drinking alcohol in Anaconda, Montana, earlier in the evening.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-11\">\u00b65 Officer Costello proceeded to administer standardized field sobriety tests. Moore performed the horizontal gaze nystagmus test but would not provide a sample for a preliminary breath test analysis. At that point, Officer Costello placed Moore under arrest for driving under the influence of alcohol. Later, at the police station, Moore again refused to submit a breath sample for analysis. As such, Officer Costello seized Moore\u2019s driver\u2019s license, pursuant to \u00a7 61-8-402(4), MCA. Costello also issued Moore citations for failure to give notice of an accident and failure to maintain insurance.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>\u00b66 On January 17, 2002, Moore filed a petition in the District Court for reinstatement of his driver\u2019s license. Moore essentially argued that Officer Costello lacked the requisite particularized suspicion to initiate the investigatory stop. Following a hearing, the District Court entered its Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order on March 4,2002. The District Court concluded that Officer Costello lawfully initiated an investigatory stop, attained the requisite probable cause to arrest Moore, and lawfully seized Moore\u2019s driver\u2019s license. Accordingly, the District Court denied Moore\u2019s petition. On March 8, 2002, Moore filed a notice of appeal from the District Court\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-4\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">\u00b67  We review a district court\u2019s findings of fact regarding the denial of a petition for reinstatement of a driver\u2019s license to determine whether those findings are clearly erroneous. <em>Kleinsasser v. State, </em>2002 MT 36, \u00b6 9, 308 Mont. 325, \u00b6 9, 42 P.3d 801, \u00b6 9. We then review the court\u2019s conclusions of law to determine whether they are correct. <em>Kleinsasser, </em>\u00b6 9. The State\u2019s act of suspending or revoking a driver\u2019s license is presumed correct. <em>Kleinsasser, </em>\u00b6 10. Therefore, the burden rests with the petitioner to prove that the State improperly suspended or revoked the license. <em>Kleinsasser, </em>\u00b6 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b150-7\">\u00b68 Did the District Court err when it denied Moore\u2019s petition for reinstatement of his driver\u2019s license?</p>\n<p id=\"b150-8\">\u00b69 Section 61-8-403(4)(a), MCA, limits a court\u2019s inquiry to specific issues in driver\u2019s license reinstatement proceedings. Although Moore raised two of the issues in his petition, the first issue proved dispositive, thus, rendering consideration of the second issue moot. As a practical matter, the only relevant issue under consideration was whether Officer Costello \u201chad reasonable grounds to believe that... [Moore] had been driving or was in actual physical control of a vehicle upon ways of this state open to the public while under the influence of alcohol, drugs, or a combination of the two ....\u201d <em>See </em>\u00a7 61-8-403(4)(a)(i), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-9\">\u00b610 The \u201creasonable grounds\u201d requirement in \u00a7 61-8-403(4)(a)(i), MCA, is the equivalent of the \u201cparticularized suspicion\u201d standard articulated in \u00a7 46-5-401, MCA. <em>Kleinsasser, </em>\u00b6 11. Section 46-5-401, MCA, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-10\">Investigative stop. In order to obtain or verify an account of the person\u2019s presence or conduct orto determine whether to arrest <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>the person, a peace officer may stop any person or vehicle that is observed in circumstances that create a particularized suspicion that the person or occupant of the vehicle has committed, is committing, or is about to commit an offense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b151-4\">We apply a two-part test to determine whether a law enforcement officer had sufficient particularized suspicion to justify an investigative stop. The State must show: (1) objective data from which an experienced officer could make certain inferences; and (2) a resulting suspicion that the occupant of the vehicle in question is or has been engaged in some wrongdoing. <em>Kleinsasser, </em>\u00b6 12. Whether a particularized suspicion exists is a question of fact dependent on the totality of the circumstances surrounding the investigative stop. <em>Grindeland v. State, </em>2001 MT 196, \u00b6 10, 306 Mont. 262, \u00b6 10, 32 P.3d 767, \u00b6 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">\u00b611 Here, Officer Costello claims that he initiated the investigatory stop, in part, based on a belief that Moore violated \u00a7 61-7-108, MCA. Section 61-7-108, MCA, provides, \u201cThe driver of a vehicle involved in an accident resulting in injury to or death of any person or property damage to an apparent extent of $500 or more shall immediately by the quickest means of communication give notice of the accident....\u201d Moore argues that Officer Costello could formulate no suspicion that Moore was engaged in wrongdoing because \u201cOfficer Costello had no such objective manifestation that Moore was not going to report the accident by the quickest means, which was to drive to his own house and call.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b151-6\">\u00b612 At the reinstatement hearing, Officer Costello testified that he witnessed the vehicle in question hit the guardrail on the Interstate. According to Costello, the vehicle did not stop following the collision. As for the resulting damage, Officer Costello testified to the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Amm\">The vehicle in question had some taillight damage to the back. It had a white light to the rear-to the right-hand side where it impacted with the guardrail. Basically, the entire passenger side of the vehicle was damaged from the accident....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-7\">I not only could see the vehicle, but as I passed, the damage to the guardrail, the vehicle basically impacted, in different areas, this guardrail. And I\u2019ve had enough experience in the past, working with the Department of Transportation on their guardrail areas, that just in itself was probably pretty close to four or five hundred dollars in damage, other-and that\u2019s not even including the vehicle.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>Once I got up behind the vehicle, I could tell there was extensive damage to the passenger side.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b152-4\">Finally, as for reporting the accident by the quickest means available, Officer Costello testified as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-5\">Q: How did you objectively determine that this vehicle was not going to report - or the driver of this vehicle was not going to report the accident by the quickest means possible?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-6\">A: There was, I believe, a Thriftway at the intersection of Amherst and Harrison that the vehicle could have pulled into and used the telephone. The vehicle continued northbound past that area.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-7\">[L]ike I testified before, he had an opportunity to stop at Amherst and Harrison at this pay phone there, and he also had an opportunity to stop at Lisac\u2019s Tri-Stop, if he wanted to, and report the accident.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b152-8\">\u00b613  Moore offered evidence to contradict the above testimony. However, the District Court concluded that \u201cOfficer Costello... testified credibly regarding the objective data that led him to infer or suspect that Petitioner had been involved in an accident and engaged in wrongdoing.\u201d The weight of the evidence and the credibility of the witnesses are \u201cexclusively the province of the trier of fact. If the evidence conflicts, it is within the province of the trier of fact to determine which shall prevail.\u201d <em>State v. Palmer </em>(1991), 247 Mont. 210, 214, 805 P.2d 580, 582 (citations omitted). Based on the foregoing, we conclude that there is sufficient evidence in the record to indicate that Officer Costello had the requisite particularized suspicion to justify an investigatory stop. As this was the primary issue raised by Moore, we hold that the District Court did not err when it denied Moore\u2019s petition for reinstatement of his driver\u2019s license.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-9\">\u00b614 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b152-10\">JUSTICES COTTER, TRIEWEILER, NELSON and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
