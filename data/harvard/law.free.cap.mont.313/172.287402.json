Following trial the jury found that Dias was wrongfully discharged and awarded damages. HMHB filed a motion for a new trial which was denied by the District Court. HMHB appeals the District Court\u2019s denial of its motion for a new trial. We affirm the Order of the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-9\">\u00b62 We address the following issues on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b195-10\">\u00b63 1. Did the District Court abuse its discretion when it denied HMHB\u2019s motion for a new trial?</p>\n<p id=\"b195-12\">\u00b64 2. Is Dias entitled to recover attorney fees pursuant to \u00a7 39-3-214, MCA?</p>\n<p id=\"b195-13\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"AR\">\u00b65 On February 18, 1994, Marcia Dias was terminated from her employment as a general project director for Healthy Mothers, Healthy Babies, Inc. HMHB claimed it was having financial difficulties and could no longer afford her position. On June 3,1995, Dias and four coworkers, who were also fired, filed a <em>pro se </em>complaint against HMHB, in which they alleged that they had been wrongfully discharged, in retaliation and without cause, in violation of HMHB\u2019s personnel policy and Montana law. The Plaintiffs requested compensatory damages for lost and -unpaid wages and punitive damages for retaliatory discharge.</p>\n<p id=\"A66\">\u00b66 On February 14, 2000, a six day jury trial commenced in the District Court regarding the claims of Dias and Amy Palmer. During jury selection, in response to a question by Palmer\u2019s attorney, a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>prospective juror commented that she would have difficulty returning a verdict for the Plaintiffs if it could limit HMHB\u2019s ability to continue its programs or expose HMHB\u2019s volunteers to personal liability. Palmer\u2019s attorney explained that the \u201cnoble volunteers\u201d were protected from personal liability by the corporate shield. The juror still expressed that she could be biased and Palmer\u2019s attorney moved to strike the juror for cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-4\">\u00b67 The District Court permitted Dias\u2019 counsel to question the juror before ruling. Dias\u2019 counsel explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-5\">Q. (By Mr. Engel) Well, the question that occurs to me in response to what you\u2019ve stated, ma\u2019am, is that when you sit as a juror, you\u2019re serving as a fact finder. You\u2019re supposed to base your opinion in the case upon what comes from the witness stand and is introduced into evidence. And when you would be considering whether or not the defendant in any case has any wherewithal to respond to a judgment by paying, you would be considering something outside of that evidence. So the general instruction-the trials that I\u2019ve participated in, when jurors are concerned about whether or not there may be insurance or some other-</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AQ4\">MR. THROSSELL: Objection, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-6\">THE COURT: Sustained.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-7\">MR. THROSSELL: And I would like the record to reflect that counsel has tainted this matter and would like this objection on the record.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-8\">THE COURT: That will be so noted.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-9\">Q. (By Mr. Engel) Well, you\u2019re not supposed to concern yourself with the source of the payment for any judgment. So my question to you then, ma\u2019am, would you be able to set aside that stated concern that you\u2019ve indicated and base your-your service on the jury based upon the evidence and what your required to do?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-10\">A. I\u2019m not certain that I could if it became apparent that the program would suffer....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b196-11\">Following a short discussion among counsel and the court, the juror was stricken.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-12\">\u00b68 At the first recess subsequent to the exchange the following discussion took place outside the presence of the jury.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-13\">MR THROSSELL: ... I wanted to make, for the record, now the defendant\u2019s objection that the availability of insurance has been inteijected into this matter. It has tainted the entire jury pool. The defendants Healthy Mothers Healthy Babies asks for a mistrial and also would ask for the dismissal of the plaintiffs [sic] case in this matter, both the plaintiffs, Palmer and Dias.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b197-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>MR. ENGEL: Well, Your Honor, I was called out of order to address an issue that a juror raised with respect to her inability to be fair and impartial because she was concerned about the wherewithal of the defendants to respond. And in attempting to elicit from her that she was not to be concerned about the source of the payment for any prospective judgment, I mentioned the word insurance. And I don\u2019t think it prejudiced, I think, or tainted the panel in any respect. It was not mentioned in-in any other context in that, Your Honor. And I will not mention it again.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b197-3\">THE COURT: The motion will be denied.... And I don\u2019t know about giving a cautionary instruction at this point. It might bring more emphasis to it. So what I\u2019ll do, Mr. Throssell, if you still want a cautionary instruction, we can issue one at the end with the rest of the instructions. But I think you should think about whether it will emphasize this thing. At this point it\u2019s probably a minor issue, and lets not let it happen again.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b197-4\">\u00b69 In his remarks, Dias\u2019 counsel did not state that HMHB was insured, nor did he misstate any fact or rule of law to the jury. The word insurance was not uttered again. A curative instruction was neither requested, nor was one given at the end of the trial. On February 22, 2000, the jury found that Dias had been wrongfully discharged from her employment without good cause and in violation of HMHB\u2019s own written personnel policy. The jury found that Dias was entitled to $91,595.84 for lost wages and benefits, and $4,380.00 for her wage and hour claim. The jury found HMHB had not acted in retaliation or engaged in actual fraud nor malice when it discharged Dias and, therefore, punitive damages were not awarded. The District Court subsequently awarded $6,658.77 for attorney fees incurred to pursue the wage and hour claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">\u00b610 A verdict was also returned in favor of Palmer. That case has been settled and is not the subject of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">\u00b611 HMHB filed a motion for a new trial on April 5,2000, and alleged that there were four irregularities during trial that prevented HMHB from having a fair trial. The first alleged irregularity was counsel\u2019s use of the word insurance in front of the jury during <em>voir dire </em>examination. HMHB argued it had been prejudiced by the remark.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-7\">\u00b612 On May 4, 2000, the District Court denied HMHB\u2019s motion and stated in part that: \u201cThe first stated reason for a new trial is that insurance was mentioned during <em>voir dire. </em>While this is true, the Court sees no evidence of any prejudice. The Court offered defense counsel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>to present a curative instruction, but non was requested.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"A7v\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b198-4\">\u00b613 The decision whether to grant a new trial is committed to the sound discretion of the district court and will not be disturbed absent a showing of manifest abuse of discretion. <em>Newbauer v. Hinebauch, </em>1998 MT 115, \u00b6 15, 288 Mont. 482, \u00b6 15, 958 P.2d 705, \u00b6 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">DISCUSSION ISSUE 1</p>\n<p id=\"b198-6\">\u00b614 Did the District Court abuse its discretion when it denied HMHB\u2019s motion for a new trial?</p>\n<p id=\"b198-7\">\u00b615 HMHB contends that the District Court abused its discretion when it refused to order a new trial because counsel\u2019s reference to insurance during trial is strictly forbidden by prior cases of this Court and that the District Court abused its discretion when it found there was no prejudice to HMHB from the reference. We are not told whether HMHB had liability insurance which covers the claims made by Dias and, if it did, why it would not be prejudicial to Dias for the jury to mistakenly assume that the claim would force this struggling non-profit organization out of business.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-8\">\u00b616 Rule 411, M.R.Evid., provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-9\">Liability Insurance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-10\">Evidence that a person was or was not insured against liability is not admissible upon the issue of whether the person acted negligently or otherwise wrongfully. This rule does not require the exclusion of evidence of insurance against liability when offered for another purpose, such as proof of agency, ownership, or control, or bias or prejudice of a witness.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b198-11\">\u00b617  Whether or not a reference to insurance during <em>voir dire </em>violates Rule 411 is a subjective determination which is left to the district court\u2019s discretion. A district court is not required to grant a new trial simply because the word insurance is spoken during trial.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A8h\">[T]he mere mention of insurance does not in every instance constitute reversible error. The important and controlling question is, How and under what circumstances was it brought into the case? ... Each case however, must, generally speaking, stand on its own particular facts and incidents and be determined by the manner and circumstances in which the question of insurance was brought into the case. Circumstances vary-likewise will the general rule and it exceptions also vary.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"At7\"><em>Francis v. Heidel </em>(1937), 104 Mont. 580, 587-88, 68 P.2d 583, 585. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>restriction imposed by Rule 411 is narrow. It prohibits evidence of insurance to prove liability but specifically provides that it may be admissible for other purposes and then offers a non-exclusive fist of examples. The notion that the mere mention of insurance can move a jury to ignore the law and award a windfall to the plaintiff is an ancient myth unsupported by any empirical data which has been brought to this Court\u2019s attention. Common sense dictates that the opposite is true. Jurors concerned that an individual might not have insurance are more likely to protect that individual and his or her assets from damages which, -unless personal to the individual, often seem abstract and theoretical. For example, in <em>Million v. Rahhal </em>(Okl. 1966), 417 P.2d 298, 300, cited in <em>Sioux v. Powell </em>(1982), 199 Mont. 148, 153, 647 P.2d 861, 864, the Oklahoma court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-3\">The prejudice created by a showing of the absence of insurance is likely to be greater than when the existence of insurance coverage is shown. Sympathy is one of the most controlling human emotions. In <em>City of New Cordell v. Lowe </em>[Okl., 389 P.2d 103], this court said:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-4\">\u2018Such information encourages sympathy for a party who presumably has no way of being reimbursed for his loss than by a favorable verdict.\u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">\u00b618 During <em>voir dire </em>examination, a prospective juror spoke at length about her difficulty returning a verdict in favor of the plaintiffs because she did not want to hamper the defendant\u2019s ability to continue its good work. Fearful that she may have evoked the sympathies of the entire jury, Dias\u2019 counsel attempted to explain that a jury is only permitted to base its factual findings on the witnesses and evidence presented at trial. He explained that a non-profit organization\u2019s ability to pay will not be in evidence, and should not be considered. He did not state that the defendant was insured. The defendant objected, but there was no lengthy discussion of the issue in front of the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-6\">\u00b619 In those cases relied on by the defendant, (for example <em>Avery v. City of Anaconda </em>(1967), 149 Mont. 495, 428 P.2d 465, and <em>D\u2019Hooge v. McCann </em>(1968), 151 Mont 353, 443 P.2d 747) insurance was repeatedly referred to in an obvious effort to influence the jury\u2019s decision. In the present case, there was one reference to \u201cinsurance\u201d in an effort to avoid prejudice to the plaintiff. We conclude that it did not occur in a manner that is prohibited by Rule 411.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-7\">\u00b620  The District Court is responsible for determining whether the reference to insurance is sufficiently prejudicial to warrant .a new trial based on the circumstances and manner in which insurance is mentioned. The District Court concluded that the use of the word <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>insurance during <em>voir dire </em>examination was a minor issue and concluded that there was no evidence of prejudice when it denied HMHB\u2019s motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-4\">\u00b621 Based on the facts of this case, we conclude that the District Court did not abuse its discretion when it denied HMHB\u2019s motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">ISSUE 2</p>\n<p id=\"b200-6\">\u00b622 Is Dias entitled to attorney fees pursuant to \u00a7 39-3-214, MCA?</p>\n<p id=\"Az5\">\u00b623 In her respondent\u2019s brief, Dias contends that she is entitled to attorney fees incurred to respond to HMHB\u2019s appeal from the wage and hour claim. HMHB asserts that Dias was required to file a cross-appeal to recover additional attorney fees incurred on appeal and that she did not do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-7\">\u00b624 Section 39-3-214, MCA, provides that a judgement in favor of the plaintiff in an action for unpaid wages must include all costs that were reasonably necessary to enter or maintain the wage claim, including attorney fees. We cited the legislature\u2019s intent to make the employee whole when we concluded that an employee was entitled to recover attorney fees for an action to pierce the corporate veil because the action was necessary to pursue the underlying wage claim. <em>Glaspey v. Workman </em>(1988), 230 Mont. 307, 309, 749 P.2d 1083, 1084-85. In <em>Glaspey II v. Workman </em>(1988), 234 Mont. 374, 377, 763 P.2d 666, 668, we held that the mandatory language of \u00a7 39-3-214, MCA, required that reasonable attorney fees be awarded to an employee who successfully appealed a wage claim action. Once again, the legislature\u2019s intent to make the employee whole was cited in our holding. <em>Glaspey II, </em>234 Mont. at 379, 763 P.2d at 672. Dias was awarded attorney fees for successful prosecution of her wage claim in the District Court. There was nothing for her to appeal. Her entitlement to attorney fees on appeal is a separate issue for consideration by this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-8\">\u00b625  We conclude that the mandatory language in \u00a7 39-3-214, MCA, and the legislature\u2019s intent to make an employee who prevails in a wage claim whole, requires that Dias recover attorney fees incurred to defend her judgment for wages on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-9\">\u00b626 We affirm the Order of the District Court and remand this case to the District Court for further proceedings to determine the amount Dias is entitled to for attorney fees incurred on appeal.</p>\n<judges id=\"b200-10\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES NELSON, LEAPHART and REGNIER concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
