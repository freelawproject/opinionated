Hickey, doing business as Baker Bus Service, filed a complaint in the District Court for the Sixteenth Judicial District in Fallon County, in which they alleged that the Defendant, Baker School District No. 12, was required to accept Baker\u2019s low bid on a bus transportation contract. The complaint also asserted that the District\u2019s bus transportation contract with Defendants John Geving and Gene Koppinger was illegal. Baker later filed a motion for leave to file an amended complaint, which the District Court granted. Baker then filed a motion for leave to file a second amended complaint, which the District Court denied. The District Court also denied Baker\u2019s motion for partial summary judgment. The District Court granted summary judgment motions made by both Koppinger and the District, and dismissed the case with prejudice. Baker appeals the District Court\u2019s summary judgment order, as well as the District Court\u2019s denial of its motion to file a second amended complaint. We affirm the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-6\">\u00b62 We restate the issues on appeal as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b186-7\">\u00b63 1. Did the District Court err when it granted the District\u2019s motion for summary judgment?</p>\n<p id=\"b186-8\">\u00b64 2. Is the contract between the District and Spartan void because of statutory violations?</p>\n<p id=\"b186-9\">\u00b65 3. Did the District Court abuse its discretion when it denied Baker\u2019s motion for leave to file a second amended complaint?</p>\n<p id=\"b186-10\">FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b186-11\">\u00b66 For approximately twenty-four years, Baker provided bus transportation to the District. However, on May 10,2001, the District\u2019s Board of Trustees elected to accept bids for its bus transportation contract, rather then to simply renew Baker\u2019s contract for another year. At the time of the Board\u2019s decision to accept bids, several board members were aware that board member John Geving intended to submit a bid. Geving recused himself from all discussions which pertained to the bus transportation contract, and resigned from his position on the Board on May 10, 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-12\">\u00b67 The Board solicited bids by newspaper advertisement between May 18,2001, and June 1,2001. Only two bids were received, one from Baker, and the other from Geving and his business partner Gene <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>Koppinger. Baker\u2019s bid was lower than Geving and Koppinger\u2019s bid. In June of 2001, the Board met several times to discuss the bus transportation contract. Finally, on June 18, 2001, the Board unanimously voted to reject Baker\u2019s bid because the Board did not feel that Baker was a \u201cresponsible\u201d bidder.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-4\">\u00b68 The Board accepted Geving and Koppinger\u2019s bid on June 18,2001. The contract between Geving and Koppinger and the District listed the contractor as Spartan Bus Line. Geving and Koppinger created Respondent Spartan Bus Line, L.L.C., on June 22, 2001. Geving and Koppinger transferred the bus transportation contract over to Spartan upon Spartan\u2019s registration with the Montana Secretary of State.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">\u00b69 On November 28,2001, Baker filed a complaint, which named the District, as well as Geving and Koppinger, as defendants. The complaint alleged that the District was required to accept Baker\u2019s low bid and that the District\u2019s contract with Geving and Koppinger was illegal. Koppinger filed a motion to dismiss Baker\u2019s complaint on December 14, 2001, and Geving filed a motion to dismiss Baker\u2019s complaint on December 17, 2001. The District then filed a motion to dismiss Baker\u2019s complaint on December 26, 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-6\">\u00b610 On January 2, 2002, Baker filed a motion for leave to file an amended complaint adding Spartan as a defendant, and filed a motion for partial summary judgment. On January 18, 2002, the District responded by filing a motion for summary judgment. The District Court granted Baker\u2019s motion for leave to file an amended complaint on January 23,2002, and Baker filed its amended complaint that same day.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-7\">\u00b611 Baker then realized that both its original complaint, as well as its amended complaint, failed to specifically allege that owners Robert and Pamela Hickey were taxpayers in Fallon County, and moved to file a second amended complaint to address this omission on February 1, 2002. On February 28, 2002, Koppinger filed a motion for summary judgment. The District Court conducted a hearing to consider all pending motions on March 22, 2002. On April 3, 2002, the District Court issued an Order, in which it denied Baker\u2019s motion for leave to file a second amended complaint, denied Baker\u2019s motion for partial summary judgment, granted the summary judgment motions made by Koppinger and the District, and dismissed the case with prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-8\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b187-9\">\u00b612 We review a district court\u2019s decision regarding a motion to amend a complaint for abuse of discretion. <em>Lindey\u2019s v. Professional </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number><em>Consultants </em>(1990), 244 Mont. 238, 242, 797 P.2d 920, 923. Our review of a district court\u2019s grant or denial of a motion for summary judgment is <em>de novo. Casiano v. Greenway Enterprises, Inc., </em>2002 MT 93, \u00b6 13, 309 Mont. 358, \u00b6 13, 47 P.3d 432, \u00b6 13. Therefore, we apply the same Rule 56, M.R.Civ.P., criteria as applied by the district court. <em>Casiano, </em>\u00b6 13. Pursuant to Rule 56, M.R.Civ.P.:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-4\">The movant must demonstrate that no genuine issues of material fact exist. Once this has been accomplished, the burden then shifts to the non-moving party to prove, by more than mere denial and speculation, that a genuine issue does exist. Having determined that genuine issues of fact do not exist, the court must then determine whether the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. We review the legal determinations made by a district court as to whether the court erred.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b188-5\"><em>Casiano, </em>\u00b6 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-6\">DISCUSSION ISSUE 1</p>\n<p id=\"b188-7\">\u00b613 Did the District Court err when it granted the District\u2019s motion for summary judgment?</p>\n<p id=\"b188-8\">\u00b614 Although the District\u2019s motion for summary judgment was filed before Baker filed its first amended complaint, the District Court analyzed the District\u2019s motion with regard to Baker\u2019s first amended complaint. Therefore, for purposes of appellate review, we will consider the District\u2019s motion for summary judgment in the context of that complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-9\">\u00b615 We examined a situation similar to this in <em>Baker v. State </em>(1985), 218 Mont. 235, 707 P.2d 20. In <em>Baker, </em>the appellant sought to have the construction contract awarded to its competitor declared illegal. The appellant also requested a determination that it was the lowest responsible bidder on the contract. <em>Baker, </em>218 Mont. at 237, 707 P.2d at 22. We analyzed the appellant\u2019s claims and noted that: \u201ca party whose offer is not accepted cannot complain or invoke the aid of the courts to compel the board to accept his offer... the provision of law <em>for letting contracts of this character to the lowest bidder is for the benefit of the public, and does not confer any right upon the lowest bidder as such.\u201d Baker, </em>218 Mont. at 239-40, 707 P.2d at 23. We further concluded that the appellant\u2019s position as an unsuccessful bidder did not give it standing to bring its claims, because the statutes governing public contracts are designed for the benefit of taxpayers, not unsuccessful bidders. <em>Baker, </em>218 Mont. at 240, 707 P.2d at 23-24.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>\u00b616  In <em>Debcon, Inc. v. City of Glasgow, </em>2001 MT 124, \u00b6 44, 305 Mont. 391, \u00b6 44, 28 P.3d 478, \u00b6 44, this Court synthesized the holdings of <em>Baker </em>and other related cases and held that for challenges to the award of a public contract, a claim for relief accrues under the following circumstances:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b189-4\">(1) the plaintiff must timely assert its claim as an aggrieved taxpayer;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b189-5\">(2) the claim must seek a remedy-such as an injunction, a writ of mandamus, or a declaratory judgment-that will protect the rights of the aggrieved taxpayer from the potential harm that will occur; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b189-6\">(3) the plaintiff must then show that the process by which the public works contract was awarded resulted from an abuse of discretion-i.e., the municipality\u2019s discretionary decision was tainted by an act of bad faith, fraud, corruption, or was otherwise arbitrary in some manner.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b189-7\">\u00b617  In the instant case, the District Court held that because the claims in Baker\u2019s first amended complaint failed to meet any of the <em>Debcon </em>requirements, Baker lacked standing to bring its first amended complaint. For example, <em>Debcon </em>requires that the plaintiff assert its claim as an aggrieved taxpayer. <em>Debcon, </em>\u00b6 44. Baker\u2019s complaint and first amended complaint do not allege that Baker or the Hickeys were aggrieved taxpayers. Although the second amended complaint alleges taxpayer status, Baker itself concedes on appeal that neither it nor the Hickeys possessed taxpayer status at the time it filed its initial complaint, or at any time thereafter. Therefore, we agree that Baker lacked standing to challenge the contract award based on the first <em>Debcon </em>factor.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-8\">\u00b618 In addition, <em>Debcon </em>requires that the plaintiffs claim seek a remedy-such as an injunction, a writ of mandamus, or a declaratory judgment-that will protect the rights of the aggrieved taxpayer from the potential harm that will occur. <em>Debcon, </em>\u00b6 44. In this case, Baker\u2019s first amended complaint requested special and consequential damages for: loss of income and profit, loss of use of equipment, costs of relocation, carrying charges on their unused equipment, and loss of equipment and assets. Baker\u2019s first amended complaint also requested that the District Court void the contract between Spartan and the District.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-9\">\u00b619  While Baker\u2019s request to void the contract between Spartan and the District may be characterized as a request for equitable relief, neither Baker nor the Hickeys are taxpayers in Fallon County. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>Accordingly, Baker did not bring its complaint as an aggrieved taxpayer seeking protection from harm. Furthermore, Baker\u2019s request for special and consequential damages is not an authorized form of relief. This Court noted in <em>Debcon </em>that because lost profit damages \u201cbenefit only the interest of an individual bidder, an award of damages for lost profits in such instances is contrary to the very public interest that the competitive bidding laws were designed to protect.\u201d <em>Debcon, </em>\u00b6 47. Therefore, the relief requested in Baker\u2019s first amended complaint is not recoverable pursuant to <em>Debcon.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b190-4\">\u00b620  Finally, <em>Debcon </em>requires that plaintiff prove that the process by which the public works contract was awarded resulted from an abuse of discretion. <em>Debcon, </em>\u00b6 44. In this case, Baker\u2019s first amended complaint includes various allegations of error regarding the District\u2019s award of its bus transportation contract to Spartan. However, our foregoing conclusions preclude any review of the merits of Baker\u2019s claims, based on lack of standing to assert them. Accordingly, we conclude that the District Court did not err when it granted the District\u2019s motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">ISSUE 2</p>\n<p id=\"b190-6\">\u00b621 Is the contract between the District and Spartan void because of statutory violations?</p>\n<p id=\"b190-7\">\u00b622 Baker maintains that the District violated the following three statutes when it awarded its bus transportation contract to Spartan: (1) \u00a7 18-1-201, MCA (1999), which lists the required procedure for securing a bid; (2) \u00a7 20-9-204, MCA (1999), which prohibits conflicts of interest and requires that contracts be awarded to the lowest responsible bidder; and (3) \u00a7 20-10-125, MCA (1999), which specifically addresses contracts with private parties for the provision of school bus transportation. Baker contends that it has standing to contest the contract between Spartan and the District, and cites <em>State ex rel. Sletten Const. Co. v. City of Great Falls </em>(1973), 163 Mont. 307, 516 P.2d 1149, and <em>Oftedal v. State ex rel. Transp. Com\u2019n, </em>2002 MT 1, 308 Mont. 50, 40 P.3d 349, as authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-8\">\u00b623 Both <em>Sletten </em>and <em>Oftedal </em>are distinguishable from this case. In <em>Sletten, </em>the City of Great Falls invited bids for a public works construction contract. The two lowest bids were received from Acton, a foreign corporation based in Minnesota, and Sletten Construction, a Montana corporation. <em>Sletten, </em>163 Mont. at 309, 516 P.2d at 1150. The City of Great Falls awarded its contract to Acton. Sletten challenged the award under the theory that Acton was not properly qualified as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>a resident contractor. That is, Sletten asserted that because it was a resident contractor, and Acton was not, Sletten should have been awarded the contract under Montana\u2019s resident contractor preference law. <em>Sletten, </em>163 Mont. at 308-09, 516 P.2d at 1149-50.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-4\">\u00b624 This Comb determined that the proper course of action was to annul Acton\u2019s certificate of residency. <em>Sletten, </em>163 Mont. at 308, 516 P.2d at 1150. We concluded, however, that the annulment did not grant Sletten standing to control the discretion of the city council in awarding a contract to the lowest responsible bidder. <em>Sletten, </em>163 Mont. at 310, 516 P.2d at 1150-51. Rather, the effect of the annulment was simply to take away Acton\u2019s status as a resident contractor. This Court then left the parties free to proceed in accordance with the law. <em>Sletten, </em>163 Mont. at 310, 516 P.2d at 1150-51.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">\u00b625 In the instant case, Baker urges this Court to void the District\u2019s contract with Spartan. Baker also asserts that it is entitled to recover personal damages. <em>Sletten </em>provides no authority for such a result. This Court\u2019s decision in <em>Sletten </em>did not give Sletten standing to challenge the City\u2019s award of the contract to Acton, nor did it void the City\u2019s contract with Acton or award Sletten personal damages. Consequently, Baker\u2019s reliance on <em>Sletten </em>is misplaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-6\">\u00b626 In <em>Oftedal, </em>the State Department of Transportation advertised for bids on a highway project. <em>Oftedal, </em>\u00b6 3. Oftedal and Sons, Inc. submitted the lowest bid. <em>Oftedal, </em>\u00b6 3. Oftedal, however, made a $789,000 mistake in calculating the amount of its bid, and requested to withdraw the bid. <em>Oftedal, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 7, 9. The State denied Oftedal\u2019s request. <em>Oftedal, </em>\u00b6 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-7\">\u00b627 This Court examined Oftedal\u2019s claim in light of \u00a7 28-2-1611, MCA, which lists situations in which a written contract may be revised by the court. <em>Oftedal, </em>\u00b6 13. We concluded that Oftedal\u2019s bidding errors did not preclude it from obtaining the equitable relief provided in \u00a7 28-2-1611, MCA. <em>Oftedal, </em>\u00b6 46. Therefore, this Court revised the contract price upward by the amount of $789,000, and ordered that the contract between Oftedal and the State be performed with that revision. <em>Oftedal, </em>\u00b6 59.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-8\">\u00b628 <em>Oftedal </em>provides no authority for the relief requested by Baker in this case. Oftedal and Sons, Inc. was not a disappointed bidder seeking to void a contract between the State and another bidder. Oftedal also requested no personal damages, it merely sought to withdraw its own bid. Further, revision of the contract between Oftedal and the State was done pursuant to the specific authority found at \u00a7 28-2-1611, MCA. Accordingly, this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Oftedal </em>did not overrule the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number><em>Baker </em>and <em>Debeon </em>line of cases, it merely recognized statutory authority to revise a contract already awarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-4\">\u00b629  As we discussed above, Baker did not have standing to bring its first amended complaint. Our decisions in <em>Sletten </em>and <em>Oftedal </em>do not provide standing. Therefore, we decline to consider any statutory violations which may have occurred in the contract between Spartan and the District.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">ISSUE 3</p>\n<p id=\"b192-6\">\u00b630 Did the District Court abuse its discretion when it denied Baker\u2019s motion for leave to file a second amended complaint?</p>\n<p id=\"b192-7\">\u00b631 Baker appeals the District Court\u2019s denial of its motion for leave to file a second amended complaint. The second amended complaint which Baker sought to file included six claims. However, Baker acknowledges that the District Court properly denied its first two claims, since neither it nor owners Robert and Pamela Hickey had taxpayer standing in Fallon County. On appeal, Baker asserts that the District Court abused its discretion when it disallowed the four remaining claims. Baker\u2019s four remaining claims were that: (1) its due process rights were violated; (2) it was deprived of rights under color of state law, and therefore entitled to damages pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1983, 1985; (3) the Respondents interfered with its prospective economic advantage; and (4) the Respondents deprived it of its right to fair competition.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-8\">\u00b632 Rule 15(a), M.R.Civ.P., provides, in pertinent part, that: \u201cA party may amend the party\u2019s pleading once as a matter of course ... Otherwise a party may amend the party\u2019s pleading only by leave of court or by written consent of the adverse party; and leave shall be freely given when justice so requires.\u201d Baker contends that pursuant to Rule 15(a), M.R.Civ.P., the District Court should have granted it leave to amend its complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-9\">\u00b633  However, this Court has previously determined that leave to amend is properly denied when the amendment is futile or legally insufficient to support the requested relief. <em>See Hobble-Diamond Cattle </em>v. <em>Triangle Irr. </em>(1991), 249 Mont. 322, 325, 815 P.2d 1153, 1155, <em>and Prentice Lumber Company, Inc. v. Hukill </em>(1972), 161 Mont. 8, 17, 504 P.2d 277, 282. We further held that although the merits of a proposed amended claim are generally not to be considered by the court, the merits of a claim <em>are </em>to be considered if the claim is frivolous, meritless, or futile. <em>Hobble-Diamond, </em>249 Mont. at 326, 815 P.2d at 1156.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>\u00b634  The District Court considered the merits of Baker\u2019s second amended complaint and found that it failed to meet the requirements of <em>Debcon. </em>Consequently, the District Court determined that Baker\u2019s second amended complaint was futile for the following reasons: (1) Baker and its owners Robert and Pamela Hickey lacked standing as Fallon County taxpayers; (2) Baker\u2019s second amended complaint was not timely; and (3) Baker\u2019s second amended complaint, which requested special and punitive damages, did not seek relief which would benefit the taxpayers of Fallon County. We conclude that Baker\u2019s second amended complaint simply casts its damage claims prohibited by <em>Debcon </em>in another form, and that, therefore, the District Court did not err when it held that Baker lacked standing to bring its second amended complaint. Therefore, we hold that because the four remaining claims in Baker\u2019s second amended complaint were futile, the District Court did not abuse its discretion when it denied Baker\u2019s motion for leave to file a second amended complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-4\">\u00b635 For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the District Court is affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b193-5\">JUSTICES NELSON, COTTER, LEAPHART and REGNIER concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
