We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-14\">\u00b62 The sole issue on appeal is whether the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court erred in concluding that Hanks had suffered an injury under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act and in turn dismissing her occupational disease claim?</p>\n<p id=\"b286-15\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b286-16\">\u00b63 On July 31,1995, Hanks went to work for Partners in Home Care, Incorporated (Partners), as a home-care aide. Her job entailed helping patients with baths and their basic personal care, including helping wheelchair bound patients into and out of their wheelchairs. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>January 2001, Hanks, then 65 years old, felt a \u201ckrik\u201d or \u201ctwinge\u201d in her back while helping an Alzheimer\u2019s patient dress. Hanks described the event as causing a \u201cpop-type sound\u201d and \u201ca little pain.\u201d She did not report the incident to her supervisor at the time.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-4\">\u00b64 Prior to the \u201ckrik\u201d incident, Hanks had never experienced back problems. Following the \u201ckrik\u201d incident, Hanks continued to experience pain. Two or three days after the incident, Hanks began having difficulty getting into and out of her car due to pain radiating into her right leg. On February 8, 2001, Hanks visited Dr. Susan Selbach, her family physician. Dr. Selbach\u2019s office notes for that visit state that Hanks \u201ccomplains that she has been having some right-sided lower back pain that goes down into her buttocks, has doubled her over on occasion.\u201d When considering possible etiologies of the pain, Dr. Selbach noted only, \u201cShe does not remember any recent falls.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">\u00b65 Despite a trial of physical therapy, Hanks continued to experience low-back pain radiating into her buttocks and leg. On March 13,2001, Hanks underwent an MRI which revealed a left-sided protruding disc at the L4-5 level, as well as significant degenerative changes at that level. Dr. Selbach restricted Hanks to light duty on March 27, 2001, and referred her to Dr. Carter Beck, a neurosurgeon. The next day Hanks told her supervisor about her back pain and the \u201ckrik\u201d incident. Hanks\u2019 supervisor filled out a first report that day which indicated that Hanks\u2019 pain was \u201cchronic\u201d and that Hanks was \u201cnot sure\u201d of the cause of her pain. Hanks could not recall the date of the \u201ckrik\u201d incident, only that it had occurred a couple of months previous, probably sometime in mid-January.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-6\">\u00b66 Hanks was seen by Dr. Beck on April 3, 2001. He reviewed her MRI, which he read as showing \u201clumbar stenosis at L4-5 where there is bilateral neural foraminal stenosis and subarticular recess stenosis.\u201d On May 9, 2001, he performed a bilateral L4-5 laminotomy and foraminotomy with partial mesial facetectomy.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-7\">\u00b67 Liberty, the insurance provider for Partners, denied Hanks benefits on account of her failure to report the \u201ckrik\u201d incident to her employer within 30 days of its occurrence as required by the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-8\">\u00b68 On August 27, 2001, at the request of the Department of Labor and Industry, Dr. Randale C. Sechrest, an orthopedic surgeon, examined Hanks. Dr. Sechrest reported that Hanks suffered from \u201clong-standing degenerative changes in the lumbar spine\u201d which were rendered symptomatic in J anuary or February of2001, and most likely were aggravated by her activity at work. In his report, Dr. Sechrest <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>stated that Hanks\u2019 need for surgery \u201carose from her underlying degenerative disease\u201d and \u201cspinal stenosis secondary to [her] longstanding degenerative\u201d disease. In his deposition, he reiterated that Hanks had long-standing and extensive degenerative back disease, but also added that her condition was aggravated and made symptomatic by the \u201ckrik\u201d incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-4\">\u00b69 The Workers\u2019 Compensation Court granted Hanks\u2019 petition for an emergency trial, which was conducted on December 10, 2001. On March 22, 2002, it issued a judgment dismissing Hanks\u2019 claim with prejudice based on its findings that although Hanks had suffered an injury under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, she had failed to comply with the Act\u2019s 30-day notice requirement. Hanks appeals from this judgment. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b288-6\">\u00b610 Did the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court err in concluding that Hanks had suffered an injury under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act and in turn denying her occupational disease claim?</p>\n<p id=\"b288-7\">\u00b611 A claimant has the burden of proof that he or she is entitled to benefits under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act. <em>King v. TTC Illinois, Inc., </em>2000 MT 260, \u00b6 11, 301 Mont. 527, \u00b6 11, 11 P.3d 1199, \u00b6 11. This Court reviews the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court\u2019s findings to determine whether they are supported by substantial credible evidence and reviews its conclusions of law to determine whether they are correct. <em>See Schimmel v. Montana Uninsured Employers Fund, </em>2001 MT 280, \u00b6 5, 307 Mont. 344, \u00b6 5, 38 P.3d 788, \u00b6 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-8\">\u00b612 Workers\u2019 compensation benefits are determined by the statutes in effect as of the date of injury. <em>Buckman v. Montana Deaconess Hosp. </em>(1986), 224 Mont. 318, 321, 730 P.2d 380, 382. The 1999 version of the Act applies since it was in effect at the time of Hanks\u2019 \u201ckrik\u201d incident. Accordingly, all statutory references hereinafter will be to the 1999 version of the Act unless otherwise indicated.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-9\">\u00b613 The 30-day notice requirement of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act is located at \u00a7 39-71-603, MCA, and provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b288-10\">A claim to recover benefits under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act for injuries not resulting in death may not be considered compensable unless, within 30 days after the occurrence of the accident that is claimed to have caused the injury, notice of the time and place where the accident occurred and the nature of the injury is given to the employer or the employer\u2019s insurer by the injured employee or someone on the employee\u2019s behalf.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b289-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>This provision of the Act is mandatory, and compliance with the notice requirement is indispensable to maintaining a claim for compensation. <em>Reil v. Billings Processors, Inc. </em>(1987), 229 Mont. 305, 309-10, 746 P.2d 617, 619. The purpose of the notice requirement is to enable the employer to protect itself by prompt investigation of the claimed accident and prompt treatment of the injury to minimize its effect. <em>Larson v. Barry Smith Logging, Inc. </em>(1994), 267 Mont. 444, 448, 884 P.2d 786, 788-89; <em>Bender v. Roundup Mining Co. </em>(1960), 138 Mont. 306, 313, 356 P.2d 469, 473.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-4\">\u00b614 Because it is undisputed that Hanks failed to report the \u201ckrik\u201d incident to Partners within 30 days of its occurrence, the threshold question in this case is whether the \u201ckrik\u201d incident qualifies as an \u201cinjury\u201d under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act. If it does, Hanks\u2019 failure to meet the mandatory requirements of the Act, specifically her failure to timely notify her employer, bars her from receiving workers\u2019 compensation benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">\u00b615  Injury, under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, is defined as \u201can unexpected traumatic incident or unusual strain; identifiable by time and place of occurrence; identifiable by member or part of the body affected; and caused by a specific event on a single day or during a single work shift.\u201d Section 39-71-119(2), MCA. In its ruling, the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court adopted Liberty\u2019s argument that Hanks\u2019 back problems arose from a specific event, the \u2018Talk\u201d incident, and thus ruled that the \u201ckrik\u201d incident did qualify as an injury subject to the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act and its 30-day notice provision. In concluding that the \u201ckrik\u201d incident qualified as an injury, the court emphasized Hanks\u2019 own testimony that prior to the \u201ckrik\u201d incident, she had never suffered back problems and that severe pain followed the \u201ckrik\u201d incident within a couple of days. This testimony confirms that Hanks\u2019 back problems were brought about by the \u201ckrik\u201d incident. We conclude that the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court\u2019s decision was based on substantial credible evidence. Therefore, we affirm its ruling that Hanks suffered an injury to which the notice provision of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act applies.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-6\">\u00b616  In some instances, however, the 30 days may be tolled if the employee has a reasonable belief at the time of an accident that he or she has suffered no injury which will require treatment or is otherwise compensable until he or she learns otherwise. <em>Killebrew v. Larson Cattle Co. </em>(1992), 254 Mont. 513, 521, 839 P.2d 1260, 1265. In this instance, Hanks\u2019 own testimony that severe pain followed the \u201ckrik\u201d incident within a couple of days precludes the tolling of the 30 days. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>This statement confirms that Hanks should have been on notice of the possible relationship between the \u201ckrik\u201d incident and her increasing symptoms at that time. Even if this Court were to determine that the 30 days did not start running until a couple of days after the \u201ckrik\u201d incident, when Hanks started to experience pain, Hanks did not report the injury to her employer within 30 days of the pain commencing. Hanks failed to notify her employer within 30 days from the date of either the incident itself, or the onset of pain a few days later. Therefore, she is barred from recovering under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-4\">\u00b617 Hanks maintains that the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act and its 30-day notice requirement do not apply to her because she did not suffer an injury, but rather she suffers from an occupational disease. To that end, Hanks contends that her work-related activity preceding and following the \u201ckrik\u201d incident caused her back problems. Therefore, Hanks argues that she is entitled to benefits under the Occupational Disease Act. Instead of a 30-day notice requirement, the Occupational Disease Act requires employer notification within one year of the claimant actually or constructively learning that his or her condition results in an occupational disease. Section 39-72-403, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">\u00b618  Occupational disease is defined as \u201charm, damage, or death as set forth in \u00a7 39-71-119(1) arising out of or contracted in the course and scope of employment and <em>caused by events occurring on more than a single day or work shift\u201d </em>Section 39-72-102(10), MCA (emphasis added). By affirming the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court\u2019s ruling that Hanks suffered from an injury, this Court necessarily recognizes that her condition was \u201ccaused by a specific event <em>on a single day </em>or during a single work shift.\u201d Section 39-71-119(2), MCA (emphasis added). Consequently, Hanks is not entitled to bring a claim under the Occupational Disease Act given that her injury did not occur on more than a single day. Moreover, in order for a condition to qualify as an occupational disease under Montana\u2019s Occupational Disease Act, it must arise \u201cin the course and scope of employment,\u201d \u00a7 39-72-102(10), MCA, and be \u201cincidental to the character of the business.\u201d Section 39-72-408, MCA. Hanks, however, has not offered any testimony that her underlying preexisting back disease was incidental to her work at Partners and, therefore, has not established that she suffers from an occupational disease. Accordingly, the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court was correct in denying her occupational disease claim with prejudice. \u00b619 Finally, Hanks urges this Court to reverse the ruling of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court because denying her benefits is contrary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>to public policy. While one \u201cobjective of the Montana workers\u2019 compensation system [is] to provide, without regard to fault, wage supplement and medical benefits to a worker suffering from a work-related injury or disease,\u201d \u00a7 39-71-105, MCA, the general intent expressed in that statute is qualified by the particular intent of the 30-day notice requirement of \u00a7 39-71-603, MCA. Our precedent clearly states that \u201c[n]otice under the statute is mandatory, and compliance is indispensable to maintaining a claim for compensation.\u201d <em>Larson v. Barry Smith Logging, Inc. </em>(1994), 267 Mont. 444, 449, 884 P.2d 786, 789; <em>Reil v. Billings Processors, Inc. </em>(1987), 229 Mont. 305, 309, 746 P.2d 617, 619.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-3\">\u00b620  The Workers\u2019 Compensation Court\u2019s ruling that the \u201ckrik\u201d incident was a single identifiable incident occurring in a single work shift, thus meeting the criteria of an injury, is based on substantial credible evidence. Therefore, the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court did not err in concluding that Hanks failed to comply with the 30-day notice requirement of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act and in dismissing her occupational disease claim with prejudice.</p>\n<judges id=\"b291-4\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES NELSON and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"AFTW\">JUSTICE TRIEWEILER</author>\n<p id=\"Aq3\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">\u00b621 I dissent from the majority Opinion. I would reverse the judgment of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">\u00b622 The result in this case is unconscionable and far from compelled by even the blindest adherence to the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-7\">\u00b623 The important facts are without dispute. Edna Hanks was a sixty-five year old widow working as a home care aid in 2001 when she developed symptoms of low back disease. She had been employed as a home care aid by Partners in Home Care, Inc., for five and a half years. She continued to work in that occupation, in spite of her age, because the social security benefits to which she is entitled through her deceased husband did little more than make her house payments. Without employment, she would not have been able to-feed herself or pay for her transportation.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-8\">\u00b624 By 2001, Edna, like most people her age, had developed considerable underlying degenerative disease in her spine. The evidence was that the degree of underlying degenerative disease would have been aggravated by the nature of employment she had engaged in for the previous five and one-half years, which included heavy lifting, bending and twisting. It was in that condition that she first experienced back symptoms while lifting a patient toward the end of January, 2001. However, she didn\u2019t go to the doctor immediately and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>she didn\u2019t complain about her symptoms. That was not her nature. She first saw a physician on February 8, 2001, but was given no diagnosis by that physician which would relate her condition to her job. She continued to work and participated in a regimen of physical therapy. However, when her symptoms persisted, her treating physician limited her to light duty and referred her to a neurosurgeon. That occurred on March 27, 2001. The next day, claimant immediately advised her supervisor about her condition and the fact that it first became symptomatic during the course of her employment sometime in January.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-4\">\u00b625 Up until March 27, 2001, Hanks had continued to perform all of her duties, including lifting people up and out of bed and in and out of wheelchairs. She testified that when she originally experienced the back pain, she had assumed it was due to an arthritic condition since her mother had suffered from disabling arthritis.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">\u00b626 No one questions that Edna Hanks\u2019 condition from which she is now disabled is related to her employment. No one questions the severity of her condition nor the extent of her permanent disability. Finally, no one disputes that Hanks notified her employer that her disability is work related immediately after learning that she would need medical treatment and be unable to return to her normal employment duties. In spite of these undisputed facts, and with the blessing of this Court, Edna Hanks has been denied any compensation for her substantial medical expenses or her lifetime of disability based on catch 22 provisions in the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">\u00b627 The Workers\u2019 Compensation Court and this Court have concluded that Hanks\u2019 condition could not be an occupational disease because it first became symptomatic during a single lifting incident. Yet, because she sustained an \u201cinjury\u201d during that incident, she is not eligible for benefits because she did not notify her employer about the \u201cinjury\u201d that she did not know she had sustained for a period of more than thirty days.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-7\">\u00b628 Based on the not uncommon facts in this case, I would interpret the evidence in a manner that permits recovery of benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-8\">\u00b629 First, I disagree with the majority\u2019s conclusion in \u00b6 16 that \u201cHanks\u2019 own testimony that severe pain followed the \u201ckrik\u201d incident within a couple of days precludes the tolling of the thirty days.\u201d Hanks actually testified as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-9\">So I felt a little cringe or a little crook in my back, as I called it. And it hurt a little bit, but I thought I was just-you know, just some little thing was going on. I didn\u2019t expect anything more than <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>that. And it stopped, and I didn\u2019t have anymore pain. And I didn\u2019t tell her hubby that I felt a little cringe in my back and that. I just kind of let it go after that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-3\">Two or three days later, I-when I started to get in and out of the car, it was hard for me to get in and out of the car. And then, it quit again. And it was pain, little pains going down my right leg, not my left leg, my right leg. And I didn\u2019t think anymore about it until, oh, it was January, February, March-towards March, I started really hurting bad at nights and that....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-4\">So, I went back to Dr. Selbach and she sent me to Dr. Beck....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-5\">So again they-I can\u2019t remember the date of the MRI but, anyway, I had the MRI and then I went back to Dr. Beck\u2019s. And it had to be about the 27th of March because just as soon as he told me what was wrong and he could see that it was wrecked, you know, on the MRI-it\u2019s like an x-ray. I went right over to Partners and told them what was going on and that I couldn\u2019t work.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">\u00b630 There were only two witnesses in this case. Edna Hanks gave the foregoing testimony at the hearing before the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court. Dr. Randale Sechrest testified by deposition. Hanks\u2019 testimony as set forth above was uncontroverted. Therefore, I disagree with the majority\u2019s conclusion that based on her own testimony, severe pain followed the \u201ckrik\u201d incident within a couple of days which precludes the tolling of the thirty-day report period. I would apply <em>Killebrew v. Larson Cattle Co. </em>(1992), 254 Mont. 513, 839 P.2d 1260, to toll the thirty-day period even if it had been established that Hanks had sustained an occupational \u201cinjury\u201d rather than an \u201coccupational disease.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b293-7\">\u00b631 However, I also disagree with the majority\u2019s observation in \u00b6 18 that Hanks has not offered testimony that her underlying pre-existing back disease was incidental to her work at Partners and, therefore, has not established an occupational disease.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-8\">\u00b632 It is true that Dr. Sechrest testified that the lifting incident in January contributed to her disability. However, Sechrest also testified that there is a relationship between the frequency of low-back problems and healthcare work because of the lifting, bending and twisting that is done over a period of time. She testified that injury to the lumbar spine occurs primarily from axial loading, flexion and twisting-all factors that are present for the healthcare worker. She testified that in addition, healthcare workers are typically lifting patients in abnormal positions where they cannot apply good body mechanics. She stated that the longer a person is a healthcare worker, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>the more cumulative stress and strain is applied to the back.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-4\">\u00b633 Dr. Sechrest testified that she believed there was a direct causal connection between healthcare work and Edna\u2019s ultimate physical condition. Most importantly, she gave the following testimony:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-5\">Q. Well, some people suffer from spinal stenosis. [A condition diagnosed in Hanks.] And I\u2019m wondering if there\u2019s a positive correlation between lifting, heavy lifting, awkward lifting and acceleration or development of spinal stenosis?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-6\">A. I would say intuitively there is. Intuitively, and probably in a broad sense bending, twisting, lifting would increase and accelerate the degree of, one, your risk of disc injury, risk of disc degeneration and would accelerate the condition once it occurs. Q. So, the lifting and working with patients that Edna did in the year preceding the crick were contributing factors to whatever degenerative disc disease she had, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-7\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-8\">Q. Are you saying that it\u2019s not possible for you to give an opinion to discriminate between how much was pre-existing condition caused by just general heavy work and how much was caused by lifting the Alzheimer\u2019s patient?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-9\">A. I think that would be accurate, as I understand your question.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ah3\">\u00b634 Based on the quoted testimony from Dr. Sechrest, I would conclude that the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court was clearly erroneous when it found that \u201clacking in his [Dr. Sechrest\u2019s] testimony and report is any indication that her underlying, pre-existing back disease was in whole or in part an occupational disease.\u201d I would conclude that the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court was also clearly erroneous when it found that Dr. Sechrest\u2019s testimony established that Hanks\u2019 condition was made symptomatic by a single incident. Dr. Sechrest actually testified that she was unable to distinguish between a single incident and the nature of Hanks\u2019 employment for purposes of determining what made Hanks\u2019 back condition symptomatic.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-10\">\u00b635 Traditionally we defer to trial judges and juries in the resolution of factual disputes. However, as we have frequently noted, that deference makes no logical sense where the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court simply reads the same deposition that we read. In that situation, we are in as good a position to evaluate the medical testimony as the trial judge. See <em>Brown v. Ament </em>(1988), 231 Mont. 158, 752 P.2d 171, and <em>Shupert v. Anaconda Aluminum Co. </em>(1985), 215 Mont. 182, 188, 696 P.2d 436, 439.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>\u00b636 Although Dr. Sechrest was unable to distinguish between the single incident in January and the long-term nature of Hanks\u2019 work for purposes of determining which more significantly contributed to her symptoms, I would conclude that when, as in this case, it is undisputed that her condition is work related, the uncertainty must be resolved in favor of providing workers\u2019 compensation coverage to the injured employee. Otherwise, the public policy set forth at \u00a7 39-71-105, MCA, to provide wage supplement and medical benefits to a worker suffering from a work-related injury or disease is frustrated.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-4\">\u00b637 This case is just the most recent example of a trend, which began in this state in 1987, to write and interpret laws for the benefit of employers and insurers without regard to the terrible human consequences that work-related injuries and diseases have on working people. I sometimes wonder if, collectively, the citizens of this state have lost sight of the fact that injured workers are real human beings with families, frequently substantial medical expenses and bills to pay for food, housing and transportation. I am sometimes concerned that as a society we have become so self centered that no one cares.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">\u00b638 Our case law is replete with examples of the insurance industry\u2019s efforts to prove that a disabled worker had an \u201coccupational disease\u201d rather than an \u201cinjury\u201d when it was to the insurer\u2019s advantage to do so. Here, on the other hand, where the injury claim is arguably barred by an unreasonable and unfair procedural requirement, the insurer goes to great lengths to spin Hanks\u2019 affliction as an \u201cinjury\u201d rather than a disease. If anyone ever needed an example of the cold and calculated manner in which injured workers are treated and the reason why liberal sanctions and attorney fees should be awarded to claimants who have been unlawfully denied their benefits, this case is it.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-6\">\u00b639 The state of the workers\u2019 compensation laws in Montana have become so unfair and one-sided that I have concluded employees would be better off if the whole system was scrapped and they were given back their common rights to sue employers who cause them injury by employer negligence. Why should employers be protected from liability for unsafe workplaces when employees get nothing in return? The assumed quid pro quo is simply no longer there.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-7\">\u00b640 For these reasons, I dissent from the majority Opinion. I would reverse the judgment of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
