Sherer filed a Motion to Dismiss the Aggravated Assault charge, contending that the facts in the Information, even if true, could not constitute the offense of Aggravated Assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-9\">\u00b62 The District Court subsequently denied Sherer\u2019s motion, and Sherer pled guilty to all counts, expressly reserving his right to appeal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>the District Court\u2019s denial of his motion to dismiss. Sherer now appeals. We affirm the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-4\">\u00b63 We rephrase the issue on appeal as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">\u00b64 Did the District Court err when it determined that Sherer\u2019s conduct as alleged in the Information, if true, could constitute the offense of Aggravated Assault?</p>\n<p id=\"b323-6\">\n<em>BACKGROUND</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b323-7\">\u00b65 From November 8,1999, to December 10,1999, Sherer placed a series of random phone calls from Fort Lauderdale, Florida, to approximately forty women residing in Bozeman, Montana. During conversations with these women, Sherer would, using various aliases, impersonate a doctor by claiming that he was treating their mother or daughter for a hereditary urinary disease and telling the women that they may also be at risk for infection.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-8\">\u00b66 Sherer asked the women about their breast size, when the women last had a pap smear and whether they were sexually active. Sherer also asked the women to perform a test on themselves using either a razorblade, a knife or fingernail polish remover, asking them to do destructive things to their bodies under the guise of performing self-tests to diagnose possible infection.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-9\">\u00b67 Most of the women contacted by Sherer did not physically harm themselves. For the thirty-six women who received telephone calls and did not harm themselves, the State charged a total of eight counts of impersonating a doctor.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-10\">\u00b68 Three women did harm themselves at Sherer\u2019s suggestion. One woman cut her nipple and another placed a knife inside her vagina. For these two calls, the State charged Sherer with two counts of criminal endangerment. The third woman, with encouragement from Sherer under the guise of medical self-examination, cut off her left nipple. For this incident, the State charged Sherer with the offense of aggravated assault, to which Sherer pled guilty, specifically reserving his right to this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-11\">\u00b69 The District Court sentenced Sherer to ten years in prison for each charge of criminal endangerment to be served consecutively. For the charge of aggravated assault, the District Court sentenced Sherer to twenty years to be served concurrently with the sentences for criminal endangerment. For the counts charging Sherer with impersonating a doctor, the District Court sentenced Sherer to thirty years, all of it suspended subject to certain conditions. Based on the aggravated assault conviction, and pursuant to \u00a7 46-23-504, MCA, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>District Court ordered Sherer to register as a violent offender. Sherer now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-4\">\n<em>DISCUSSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">\u00b610 Did the District Court err when it determined that Sherer\u2019s conduct as alleged in the Information, if true, could constitute the offense of Aggravated Assault?</p>\n<p id=\"b324-6\">\u00b611 The grant or denial of a motion to dismiss in a criminal case is a question of law which is reviewed <em>de novo </em>on appeal. <em>State v. Price, </em>2002 MT 229, \u00b6 9, 311 Mont. 439, \u00b6 9, 57 P.3d 42, \u00b6 9 (citing <em>State v. Hardaway, </em>2001 MT 252, \u00b6 64, 307 Mont. 139, \u00b6 64, 36 P.3d 900, \u00b6 64). \u00b612 Section 45-5-202(1), MCA, the statute defining aggravated assault, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-7\">A person commits the offense of aggravated assault if the person purposely or knowingly causes serious bodily injury to another.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AIY\">Conduct is the cause of a result if, without the conduct, the result would not have occurred and any additional causal requirements imposed by the specific statute defining the offense are satisfied. Section 45-2-20l(1)(a) and (b), MCA. \u201cConduct\u201d means an act or series of acts and the accompanying mental state. Section 45-2-101(14), MCA. An \u201cact\u201d includes any bodily movement, any form of communication, and when relevant, a failure or omission to take action. Section 45-2-101(1), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-8\">\u00b613 In Sherer\u2019s motion to dismiss, he argued that the facts alleged in the Information forming the basis for the State\u2019s charge of aggravated assault, even if true, did not meet the statutory criteria constituting the crime of aggravated assault. Sherer argued that \u201c[ejncouraging someone to injure themselves does not constitute aggravated assault. Therefore, the causal link between the Defendant\u2019s alleged acts and the resulting injury of the victims does not exist.\u201d Sherer argued that, because the allegations did not establish the offense, probable cause did not exist to charge him with the crime of aggravated assault and the charge of aggravated assault must, therefore, be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-9\">\u00b614 On appeal, Sherer likewise argues that the \u201ccausation\u201d element in the present case is too remote to form the basis of an aggravated assault charge.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-10\">The victim who severed her own nipple, albeit at the direction of Sherer, inflicted \u201cserious bodily injury\u201d upon herself. No force was involved. The district court\u2019s determination that but for Sherer\u2019s telephone call the self-mutilation would not have occurred is only part of the consideration in a decision to impose legal causation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>for criminal liability. It is also true that but for the victim\u2019s conduct the injury would not have occurred.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b325-4\">\u00b615 Sherer directs this Court to the Pennsylvania Superior Court case of <em>Commonwealth v. Rementer </em>(Pa. Super. 1991), 598 A.2d 1300, arguing therefrom that criminal causation in this case requires a \u201csocial determination of whether it is fair in principle or just under the facts of the case to expose [Sherer] to criminal liability\u201d under the aggravated assault statute, and contends that exposure to liability under the statute would require utilizing tort proximate cause principles. Sherer further argues that, because aggravated assault is designated as an offense for which Sherer must register as a \u201cviolent offender\u201d pursuant to \u00a7 46-23-504, MCA, this Court ought to abide by Black\u2019s Law Dictionary\u2019s definition of \u201cviolent offenses,\u201d which characterizes violent offenses by extreme physical force and assault and battery by means of a dangerous weapon, and that to do otherwise amounts to imposing criminal liability where the criteria for criminal causation are non-existent. See Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (6th ed. 1990). \u00b616 Sherer does concede, as this Court stated in <em>State v. Walsh </em>(1997), 281 Mont. 70, 931 P.2d 42 <em>(overruled on other </em>grounds), that it is not necessary that the victim of an assault be the direct recipient of the defendant\u2019s actions, and, therefore, that the defendant\u2019s act of force need not be directed intentionally toward the injured victim. <em>Walsh, </em>281 Mont. at 76, 931 P.2d at 46. Sherer argues, however, that this rule presumes that the defendant must be within close physical proximity to the intended victim, and therefore inapplicable to this situation. \u00b617 First, we agree with the State that <em>Commonwealth v. Rementer </em>is inapposite. In <em>Rementer, </em>the defendant had beaten the victim who then fled into the path of an oncoming car. The court analyzed the difference between tort and criminal causation, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b325-5\">In other words, was the defendant\u2019s conduct so directly and substantially linked to the actual result as to give rise to the imposition of criminal liability or was the actual result so remote and attenuated that it would be unfair to hold the defendant responsible for it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b325-6\">[I]f the fatal result was an unnatural or obscure consequence of the defendant\u2019s actions, our sense of justice would prevent us from allowing the result to impact on the defendant\u2019s guilt.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b325-7\"><em>Rementer, </em>598 A.2d at 1304-07. The <em>Rementer </em>Court thus addressed the issue in terms of foreseeability, affirming Rementer\u2019s conviction for third-degree murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>\u00b618  There are two important distinctions between this case and <em>Rementer. </em>First, whereas the defendant in <em>Rementer </em>did not intend to cause the traffic accident which followed his assault, Sherer\u2019s instructions to engage in self-destructive activity were intended to produce the precise injury suffered by the victim. In admitting to the facts alleged in the Information, Sherer cannot credibly claim that he did not intend the precise injury that the victim suffered. Sherer, impersonating a sympathetic and caring doctor, instructed the victim to cut off her nipple. The victim\u2019s obedient actions flowed directly from Sherer\u2019s instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-4\">\u00b619 Second, it is not necessary for us to consult the tort law concept of foreseeability in this criminal context. Montana\u2019s criminal code provides the proper framework for analyzing the question of whether the result is within the contemplation or purpose of the defendant. In addition to the statutes cited above, \u00a7 45-2-201(2), MCA, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b326-5\">If purposely or knowingly causing a result is an element of an offense and the result is not within the contemplation or purpose of the offender, either element can nevertheless be established if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b326-6\">(b) the result involves the same kind of harm or injury as contemplated but the precise harm or injury was different or occurred in a different way, <em>unless the actual result is too remote or accidental to have a bearing on the offender\u2019s liability or on the gravity of the offense. </em>[Emphasis supplied].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b326-7\">Given the facts in the Information, Sherer cannot argue the victim\u2019s resulting injury was not within his contemplation or purpose nor too remote or accidental to have a bearing on his liability. His intent that the injury flow from his conduct is properly inferred from the facts and circumstances connected with the offense. Section 45-2-103(3), MCA. The details of Sherer\u2019s communication with the victim reveal that the resulting injury is exactly what Sherer intended.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-8\">\u00b620 We thus do not agree with Sherer that exposure to liability under the aggravated assault statute would require utilizing tort proximate cause principles rather than the more direct cause required for criminal liability under our statutes. To the contrary, the statutes defining \u201ccause\u201d and \u201cconduct\u201d are broad enough to encompass Sherer\u2019s conduct as charged. \u201cConduct\u201d is defined as any bodily movement or any form of communication and the accompanying mental state, and conduct is the cause of the intended injury if, without the bodily movement or communication, the intended result would not have occurred. <em>See </em>\u00a7\u00a7 45-2-20l(l)(a) and (b), 45-2-101(14) and 45-2-101(1), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-4\">\u00b621  The above statutes, in conjunction with the statute defining aggravated assault, do not require that the defendant personally direct force toward the victim, but specifically contemplate that any form of communication, itself, may be sufficient conduct. Neither does the statute define or require a defined parameter of proximity between the defendant and the victim, Sherer\u2019s arguments notwithstanding. Accordingly, we conclude that the statute defining aggravated assault and the statutes defining cause, act and conduct, pursuant to \u00a7 45-1-102(l)(c), MCA, give fair warning that the nature of Sherer\u2019s conduct constituted the offense of aggravated assault if his conduct resulted in the intended injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">\u00b622  Considering our conclusion thus far, we find little merit in Sherer\u2019s contention that this Court ought to adopt the definition of \u201cviolent offenses,\u201d as defined in Black\u2019s Law Dictionary, merely because conviction of aggravated assault may result in a defendant being required to register as a \u201cviolent offender\u201d pursuant to \u00a7 46-23-504, MCA. The criteria for criminal causation are well-defined by Montana statute and gave fair warning that the admittedly manipulative and deceptive conduct of Sherer, in conjunction with the intended result, constituted the offense of aggravated assault. Sherer succeeded in causing the intended injury and now attempts to blame the victim for lending credence to his deceptive, illegal activity, essentially attempting to absolve himself of criminal liability because the victim \u201cfell for it.\u201d Such argument is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">\u00b623 Finally, Sherer cites to numerous cases from other jurisdictions for the proposition that threatening words, no matter how violent or threatening, do not by themselves constitute assault since the actor must be in a position to carry out the threat immediately and must take some affirmative step to do so. Considering the facts as alleged in the Information and the discussion thus far, we find little merit in this argument. The Information did not rely on or allege that Sherer threatened to use physical force to injure the victim. Dismissal of the aggravated assault charge in the Information could not, therefore, be predicated on this argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-7\">\u00b624  Accordingly, we hold that the District Court did not err when it denied Sherer\u2019s motion to dismiss the charge of aggravated assault. The decision of the District Court is affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b327-8\">JUSTICES COTTER, NELSON, REGNIER and TRIEWEILER concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
