We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"A-i\">\u00b62 Geiger presents the following three issues on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b265-9\">\u00b63 1. Did the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court err in concluding that David Deckert d/b/a David Deckert Trucking was not an \u201cemployer\u201d as defined by \u00a7 39-71-117(1) and (4), MCA (1997)?</p>\n<p id=\"b265-10\">\u00b64 2. Did the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court err in concluding that Geiger was not an \u201cemployee\u201d or \u201cworker\u201d as defined by \u00a7 39-71-118(l)(a), MCA (1997)?</p>\n<p id=\"b265-11\">\u00b65 3. Did the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court err in concluding that neither the UEF nor Deckert was equitably estopped from denying compensation for Geiger\u2019s injuries?</p>\n<p id=\"b265-12\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b265-13\">\u00b66 In March of 1997, Geiger was hired by David Deckert (Deckert), d/b/a David Deckert Trucking (Deckert Trucking), an interstate trucking business under authority from the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC). In late 1997, Deckert financed the purchase of a second truck and leased a second trailer. Geiger began driving the second truck and leased trailer. In 1998, Deckert\u2019s attorney drafted an independent contractor agreement for Geiger. Although he was repeatedly asked to do so, Geiger never signed the agreement. Finally, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>Deckert started withholding taxes and social security from Geiger\u2019s wages, and in May 1998, he obtained workers\u2019 compensation coverage for Geiger.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-4\">\u00b67 A couple of months later, Geiger and Deckert discussed Geiger\u2019s purchase of the second truck. Because Geiger was unable to secure adequate financing, the two parties entered into a sales contract whereby Geiger paid monthly installments to Deckert who in turn paid the original lender. The contract provided that Geiger would pay the insurance premiums, maintenance, license fees and fuel costs for the truck. The parties also entered into a lease agreement that required Geiger to pay the license fees, insurance, and maintenance of the trailer. Both the contract and the lease agreement specifically provided that during the terms of the agreements Geiger was required to operate the tractor and trailer under Deckert Trucking\u2019s ICC authority, because Deckert recognized that until the truck was in Geiger\u2019s name, Geiger could not license and insure the truck, nor get his own ICC authority required for certain interstate hauls. Deckert\u2019s attorney drafted the sales contact and lease agreement in September of 1998; however, they were not signed until April 1, 1999.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">\u00b68 At the time the contract and lease were signed, Deckert notified Geiger that Deckert had stopped payroll withholdings and had quit paying workers\u2019 compensation premiums for Geiger. Even prior to the signing of the sales contract and lease agreement on April 1,1999, and at least as early as October 1998, Geiger arranged his own loads. A substantial part of Geiger\u2019s hauls were arranged by Geiger without the aid of Deckert, and in many cases clients paid Geiger directly. Geiger also arranged brokerage loads by contacting the brokerage firms directly. Deckert\u2019s involvement was limited to notifying the brokers that Geiger was operating under Deckert\u2019s ICC authority. Payments for loads arranged through brokerage firms were typically remitted to Deckert. After April 1,1999, Deckert deducted amounts due to himself under the truck contract and lease from the amounts received for loads driven by Geiger. Most importantly, Deckert did not take a percentage or fee for loads and made no profit with respect to Geiger\u2019s trucking operations.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-6\">\u00b69 The amounts received by Deckert were insufficient to cover Geiger\u2019s payments under the contract and lease. As a result, Deckert fell behind in his payments to the original lender. On June 23, 1999, Deckert informed Geiger that the monies received were insufficient to cover Geiger\u2019s expenses. Two days later, while driving the truck through Illinois, Geiger sustained a closed head injury when he fell ten <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>feet from the top of his tractor trailer to the concrete. At the time he was injured, Geiger was hauling a load for ProAm, a brokerage company, pursuant to Deckert\u2019s ICC authority. Deckert did not have workers\u2019 compensation insurance coverage at the time of Geiger\u2019s injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-3\">\u00b610 On October 21,1999, Geiger filed a First Report of Injury with the Montana Department of Labor and Industry which was routed to the Uninsured Employers\u2019 Fund on November 2, 1999, because Deckert was uninsured. Initially, the UEF was unable to make a compensability determination without additional investigation; however, it paid benefits to Geiger under a full reservation of rights pursuant to \u00a7 39-71-608, MCA (1997). After an investigation, the UEF denied coverage for the claim based upon its conclusion that Geiger did not suffer a compensable work-related injury and that he was not working as an employee of Deckert at the time of his claimed injury. The UEF officially denied Geiger coverage on April 10, 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-4\">\u00b611 Geiger appealed the UEF\u2019s determination to the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court. At trial, the UEF defended its initial denial, reasoning that Geiger was not an \u201cemployee or worker in this state\u201d as required by \u00a7 39-71-118(10)(a), MCA (1997). Conversely, during the trial Deckert argued that Geiger was precluded from workers\u2019 compensation benefits because Geiger was an independent contractor as defined in \u00a7 39-71-120, MCA (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b267-5\">\u00b612 The Workers\u2019 Compensation Court ruled that Deckert was not an \u201cemployer,\u201d and that Geiger was not his \u201cemployee\u201d as defined in the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act. Therefore, it concluded that Geiger was not eligible for benefits under the Act. The Workers\u2019 Compensation Court did not address the issue of whether Geiger was an independent contractor. Geiger filed a timely post-trial motion in which he raised the issue of equitable estoppel. The Workers\u2019 Compensation Court denied Geiger\u2019s motion for reconsideration and rejected the equitable estoppel argument. Following the timely filing of this appeal, David Deckert passed away and his estate elected not to participate further.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-6\">Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b267-7\">\u00b613 This Court employs two standards of review for decisions of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court: we review the findings of fact to determine if they are supported by substantial, credible evidence, and we review conclusions of law to determine if they are correct. <em>Hale v. Royal Logging, </em>1999 MT 302, \u00b6 11, 297 Mont. 165, \u00b6 11, 990 P.2d 1245, \u00b6 11; <em>Turjan v. Valley View Estates </em>(1995), 272 Mont. 386, 390, 901 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>P.2d 76, 79.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-4\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b268-5\">\u00b614 Workers\u2019 compensation benefits are determined by the statutes in effect as of the date of injury. <em>Buckman v. Montana Deaconess Hosp. </em>(1986), 224 Mont. 318, 321, 730 P.2d 380, 382. The 1997 version of the Act applies since it was in effect at the time of Geiger\u2019s injury. Accordingly, all statutory references hereinafter will be to the 1997 version of the Act unless otherwise indicated.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-6\">Issue 1</p>\n<p id=\"b268-7\">\u00b615 Did the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court err in concluding that Deckert was not an \u201cemployer\u201d as defined by \u00a7 39-71-117(1) and (4), MCA?</p>\n<p id=\"b268-8\">\u00b616 The resolution of this case involves the interpretation and application of \u00a7\u00a7 39-71-117 and 39-71-118, MCA, which define \u201cemployer\u201d and \u201cemployee\u201d under the Montana Workers\u2019 Compensation Act. Because the Act \u201capplies to all employers, as defined in 39-71-117, and to all employees, as defined in 39-71-118,\u201d these provisions indirectly establish who must provide workers\u2019 compensation coverage and what workers are covered under the Act. Section 39-71-401(1), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-9\">\u00b617 Two subsections of \u00a7 39-71-117, MCA, defining \u201cemployer\u201d apply to the case at bar. The first definition is specific to interstate motor carriers such as Deckert Trucking. It provides that \u201c(4) [a]n interstate or intrastate common or contract motor carrier doing business in this state who <em>uses </em>drivers in this state is considered the employer, [and] is liable for workers\u2019 compensation premiums....\u201d Section 39-71-117(4), MCA (emphasis added). Applying this definition to the facts before it, the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court found that Deckert Trucking was doing business in Montana, that it was an interstate contract motor carrier, and that Geiger drove within Montana; however, the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court ultimately concluded that Deckert did not \u201cuse\u201d Geiger and therefore was not his employer under this definition.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-10\">\u00b618 In concluding that Deckert did not \u201cuse\u201d Geiger in his interstate trucking business, the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court focused on whether Geiger had benefitted Deckert. The findings of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court indicated that Deckert had not received any percentage or other fee for the loads carried by Geiger, and that he had not received any financial benefit from Geiger\u2019s actual expenses of operating the truck since the signing of the contract and lease on April <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>1, 1999. Because the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court was \u201cunable to discern any \u2018use\u2019 to which Deckert put Geiger after they entered into the truck and trailer contract and lease,\u201d the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court held that Deckert was not an employer under \u00a7 39-71-117(4), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-4\">\u00b619 The Workers\u2019 Compensation Court then applied a second, more general definition of \u201cemployer\u201d which defines an employer as one who \u201chas a person <em>in service </em>under an appointment or contract of hire ....\u201d Section 39-71-117(l)(a), MCA (emphasis added). Applying the same reasoning mentioned in the preceding paragraph, the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court ruled that Geiger was not in service to Deckert. Accordingly, the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court held that Deckert was not an employer under the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-5\">\u00b620 Geiger maintains that the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court erred in concluding that Deckert was not an employer under the Act. First, Geiger argues that the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court\u2019s interpretation of \u201cuse\u201d in the first definition is too narrow because it requires an employee to financially benefit or profit his employer. Geiger asserts that the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court\u2019s interpretation of \u201cuse\u201d would allow a floundering business to avoid paying workers\u2019 compensation premiums for its employees solely because it was not turning a profit. \u00b621 Because the resolution of this issue is dependent on the meaning of the word \u201cuse\u201d in \u00a7 39-71-117(4), MCA, we look to the rules of statutory construction which require the language of a statute to be construed according to its plain meaning. If the language is clear and unambiguous, no farther interpretation is required. <em>Rausch v. State Compensation Ins. Fund, </em>2002 MT 203, \u00b6 33, 311 Mont. 210, \u00b6 33, 54 P.3d 25, \u00b6 33; <em>Lovell v. State Compensation Mut. Ins. Fund </em>(1993), 260 Mont. 279, 285, 860 P.2d 95, 99.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-6\">\u00b622 In the instant case, we believe that the statutory language of \u00a7 39-71-117(4), MCA, is clear. \u201cUse\u201d is defined as \u201cto put into service or apply for a purpose; employ ....\u2019\u2019AMERICAN HERITAGE DICTIONARY 1966 (3d ed. 1992). The verb \u201cuse\u201d in the statutory context of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act means that the employer utilizes the driver to serve an end, a purpose. Geiger contends that Deckert \u201cused\u201d him for the purpose of making payments to the original creditor and in turn increasing Deckert\u2019s equity in the second truck. However, the fact that Geiger made a number of monthly payments under the contract and lease does not mean that Deckert used him to serve Deckert\u2019s trucking business. This \u201cbenefit\u201d received by Deckert was contemplated in their sales contract and lease agreement -not in a contract for hire. In fact, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>as of April 1, 1999, Geiger and Deckert\u2019s relationship more closely resembles that of debtor and creditor. We cannot hold that Deckert \u201cused\u201d Geiger under this definition of employer simply because Deckert received monthly installments according to a contract. If we were to make such a ruling, then any party facilitating the payment on a contract for the sale of equipment could be required to pay workers\u2019 compensation premiums for the debtor. Obviously, this is not the intent of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-4\">\u00b623  The trial court\u2019s reasoning that because Deckert did not use Geiger, Geiger was not in Deckert\u2019s service, is also sound. Accordingly, we agree with the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court that Deckert did not use Geiger, that Deckert did not have Geiger in service, and thus Deckert was not an employer under either definition.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">Issue 2</p>\n<p id=\"b270-6\">\u00b624 Did the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court err in concluding that Geiger was not an \u201cemployee\u201d or \u201cworker\u201d as defined by \u00a7 39-71-118(l)(a), MCA?</p>\n<p id=\"b270-7\">\u00b625 Because we have ruled that Deckert was not Geiger\u2019s employer, we need not consider whether Geiger was Deckert\u2019s employee.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-8\">Issue 3</p>\n<p id=\"b270-9\">\u00b626 Did the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court err in concluding that neither the UEF nor Deckert was equitably estopped from denying compensation for Geiger\u2019s injuries?</p>\n<p id=\"b270-10\">\u00b627 Lastly, Geiger contends that Deckert and the UEF should be equitably estopped from denying his claim. \u201cEquitable estoppel applies when an employer ... has taken some positive action which either prevents a claimant from filing a timely claim or leads the claimant reasonably to believe she need not file such a claim.\u201d <em>Kuzara v. State Compensation Ins. Fund </em>(1996), 279 Mont. 223, 231, 928 P.2d 136, 141. One of the six requirements for the application of the doctrine of equitable estoppel is conduct amounting to a representation or a concealment of material facts. <em>See Kuzara, </em>279 Mont. at 231, 928 P.2d at 141.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-11\">\u00b628 Geiger insists that Deckert concealed from him the fact that Deckert had discontinued paying for Geiger\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation coverage. To that end, Geiger categorically denies that he was ever notified by Deckert that he would no longer be paying Geiger\u2019s premiums. The Workers\u2019 Compensation Court was not convinced by Geiger\u2019s testimony on this matter; instead it was \u201cpersuaded that at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>that time [April 1, 1999] Geiger understood that any workers\u2019 compensation insurance was his responsibility.\u201d Therefore, because Deckert had not concealed or misrepresented that he had ceased paying for Geiger\u2019s coverage, it ruled that Deckert and the UEF were not equitably estopped from denying Geiger\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-4\">\u00b629  We have reviewed the record and believe that the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court based its conclusion on substantial credible evidence, specifically Deckert\u2019s testimony that he had notified Geiger that he was no longer paying for Geiger\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation coverage at the time the contract and lease were signed. When, as here, the trial court is the trier of fact, it is in the best position to determine the facts by assessing the demeanor of the witnesses, the testimony presented and the totality of the evidence before the court. <em>See Yellowstone Basin Properties, Inc. v. Burgess </em>(1992), 255 Mont. 341, 352, 843 P.2d 341, 348 (quoting <em>General Mills, Inc. v. Zerbe Bros., Inc. </em>(1983), 207 Mont. 19, 23, 672 P.2d 1109, 1111). We will not disturb the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court\u2019s finding. Because Geiger knew that Deckert had discontinued paying for his workers\u2019 compensation coverage, his estoppel argument necessarily fails; at the very least, one of the six elements required for the doctrine\u2019s application is not present. This Court need not address the five remaining elements of equitable estoppel. Therefore, we hold that the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court did not err in concluding that neither the UEF nor Deckert was equitably estopped from denying compensation for Geiger\u2019s injuries. \u00b630 The order of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court is affirmed in its entirety for the reasons discussed above.</p>\n<judges id=\"b271-5\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES COTTER and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b271-6\">JUSTICE TRIEWEILER</author>\n<p id=\"ANA\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-7\">\u00b631 I dissent from the majority\u2019s Opinion. I would reverse the judgment of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-8\">\u00b632 The Workers\u2019 Compensation Court and the majority have correctly identified the narrow issue in this case. It is simply whether at the time of his injury the claimant, Joseph Geiger, was being \u201cused\u201d as a driver by David Deckert, d/b/a David Deckert Trucking. Accepting the majority\u2019s definition of used as \u201cto put into service or apply it for a purpose;....\u201d it is clear that Geiger was serving a purpose for Deckert at the time of his injury. In fact, the nature of Geiger\u2019s and Deckert\u2019s relationship changed in no substantive way from the period prior to March of 1999 when Deckert carried workers\u2019 compensation insurance for Geiger and considered him an employee and the date of Geiger\u2019s injury on June 25, 1999.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>\u00b633 At the time of Geiger\u2019s injury, the tractor and trailer that he was operating were still owned by Deckert; it was still insured by Deckert; it was still being operated pursuant to Deckert\u2019s interstate commerce commission authority; the brokers through whom jobs were obtained still recognized Deckert as the trucking operator and all payments which came from those brokers went directly to Deckert who then controlled the disbursement of those funds by making the lease payments, depositing $500 a month in an escrow account, paying various expenses associated with the truck\u2019s operation, and making payments for the truck which were actually owed by Deckert to a third party.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-4\">\u00b634 From October of 1998 through June of 1999, Geiger paid to Deckert at least $16,080.25 for the payments mentioned in the previous paragraph. These payments were of \u201cuse\u201d to Deckert because he used them to maintain his tractor, lease his trailer, reduce the debt on his tractor and fund an escrow account for necessary repairs to the tractor and trailer in the event that they were eventually returned to him by Geiger. It could not be more obvious that Deckert was an interstate common contract motor carrier who \u201cused\u201d Geiger. Therefore, by the plain language of \u00a7 39-71-117(4), MCA (1997), Geiger was Deckert\u2019s employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">\u00b635 In \u00b6 5, the majority attaches significance to the fact that Deckert made no profit from Geiger\u2019s trucking operations. The reason is self evident from the first sentence in the following paragraph. The amount that Geiger was able to generate was insufficient to cover the payments for the tractor and trailer and its expenses. However, the mere fact that the operation was unprofitable should not determine the nature of the parties\u2019 relationship. Geiger still prolonged the period of time over which Deckert was able to own the tractor and trailer which he would have to have returned to the third party earlier had Deckert not operated it for him and provided him with most of the income from his operations.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">\u00b636 In \u00b6 19, the majority states that, \u201cthe fact that Geiger made a number of monthly payments under the contract and lease does not mean that Deckert used him to serve Deckert\u2019s trucking business.\u201d However, I disagree. The fact that Geiger made a number of monthly payments under the contract and provided other income which allowed for the maintenance, operation and insurance of the tractor and trailer which was owned by Deckert and operated by Deckert\u2019s trucking business, did serve his interest. As stated earlier, if Geiger had not provided the revenue to pay these expenses, Deckert would have to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>have returned the truck to the party to whom he was making payments months earlier than he, in fact, did return it.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-4\">\u00b637 Finally, in \u00b6 19, the majority states that if the Corut was to hold that receiving monthly installments according to a contract satisfied the definition of \u201cused,\u201d then \u201cany party facilitating the payment on a contract for sale of equipment could be required to pay workers\u2019 compensation premiums for the debtor.\u201d That observation is a gross simplification of Geiger\u2019s and Deckert\u2019s financial relationship and, at the same time, a broad expansion of the application of \u00a7 39-71-117(4), MCA (1997). First, Geiger was not simply making monthly installments according to a purchase contract. All of the income that he earned from jobs arranged by brokers was sent directly to Deckert who then used that money to make the payments he owed for his truck, to make lease payments on the trailer, to pay for insurance for the truck and trailer and to pay operating and maintenance expenses. Second, to hold that Deckert\u2019s total dependency on Geiger for revenue with which to pay for and maintain his truck would open the flood gates of workers\u2019 compensation litigation to \u201cany party facilitating the payment on a contract for the sale of equipment\u201d ignores the fact that \u201cused\u201d is only significant for purposes of the definition of employer found at \u00a7 39-71-117(4), MCA, which pertains only to interstate motor carriers such as Deckert Trucking. One of the reasons for providing broad coverage for drivers who are used by interstate motor carriers is the history of creative methods in the trucking industry for avoiding an employer\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation responsibilities. Deckert\u2019s demand that Geiger sign an agreement that he was an independent contractor before the sales contract was ever executed is just one example.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">\u00b638 The majority Opinion exalts form over substance and falls victim to another smoke and mirror method of avoiding coverage for the state\u2019s injured workers.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">\u00b639 For these reasons, I dissent from the majority Opinion. I conclude, based on the undisputed facts, that Geiger was Deckert\u2019s employee at the time of his injury and would, therefore, reverse the judgment of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court.</p>\n<judges id=\"b273-7\">JUSTICES REGNIER and NELSON join in the foregoing dissent.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
