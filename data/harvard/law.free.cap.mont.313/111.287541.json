Winkle appeals. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-11\">\u00b62 The issue is whether the District Court violated Winkle\u2019s right to due process of law in sentencing him.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-12\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b134-13\">\u00b63 On August 24, 2000, Columbus, Montana, Police Officer Mike Fuss picked up a runaway 16-year-old girl from the Town Pump parking lot, where she was found with 37-year-old Winkle. The girl was taken to the Youth Detention Center in Billings, but escaped the next day. That evening, Montana Highway Patrol Officer Jeremy Lee located the girl-again with Winkle-in Winkle\u2019s truck on a dirt road approximately eight miles south of Columbus.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>\u00b64 The State of Montana charged Winkle by information with custodial interference and driving without a valid driver\u2019s license. The District Court released him on bail under conditions which included avoiding all contact with the girl. Winkle waived his right to speedy trial and, in October of 2001, pled guilty to custodial interference pursuant to a plea agreement. In entering the plea, Winkle admitted he picked the girl up at the Youth Detention Center and took her to Stillwater County despite having no legal right to do so with a juvenile runaway.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-4\">\u00b65 The District Court scheduled sentencing for January 7,2002, but continued it to February 1, 2002, at Winkle\u2019s request because he was having difficulty traveling back to Montana from New Mexico, where he had relocated. At the beginning of the sentencing hearing, the court asked Winkle\u2019s counsel whether he had received a copy of the presentence investigation report and an attached letter dated January 15, 2002, from Tom Woods, the probation and parole officer who prepared the report. Winkle\u2019s counsel responded that the copies had been received. Winkle\u2019s counsel then referred to a letter from the victim\u2019s grandmother to Woods-a letter not of record-and said that, although that letter, and the presentence investigation report stated Winkle was living with the runaway girl, Winkle denied doing so. Winkle did state that the girl came to his home in New Mexico \u201cfrom time to time\u201d to see his son.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">\u00b66 The court then inquired whether Winkle and his counsel had received a copy of a January 30, 2002, letter from Woods. Winkle\u2019s counsel replied he had not seen that letter and the court allowed time to review it.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-6\">\u00b67 After reviewing the January 30 letter, Winkle\u2019s counsel expressed concern that the court might be considering revoking Winkle\u2019s release on bail because the letter stated Woods had confirmed that the victim had been living with Winkle in violation of the \u201cno contact\u201d condition of his release on bail. Counsel stated he would like to \u201cignore the whole darn thing and sentence Mr. Winkle.\u201d The court assured him it was not considering revoking the release order and said that, given Winkle\u2019s expressed difficulties in traveling back and forth from New Mexico, they \u201cprobably ought to proceed to sentencing at this time.\u201d Counsel said Winkle would prefer not to rebut the letters and asked that the sentencing proceed.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-7\">\u00b68 The prosecutor recommended a five-year suspended sentence pursuant to the plea agreement. Defense counsel recommended a three-year deferred imposition of sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>\u00b69 Woods, the only witness at the sentencing hearing, testified the presentence investigation report was incomplete because Winkle had been \u201csubstantially noncompliant\u201d with efforts to prepare it. Regarding the substance of his January 15 letter, Woods testified that he had twice provided Winkle with presentence investigation questionnaires to fill out and return, but Winkle had never returned them or telephoned, as directed. Woods also expanded on his January 30 letter, testifying that on January 22, 2002, he received a telephone call from a relative of the runaway girl who told him the girl was now living with Winkle in New Mexico and that, on January 30, 2002, the manager of the apartment building where Winkle lived in New Mexico confirmed that the girl had been living with Winkle since December of 2000. Woods stated he did not feel Winkle was a good candidate for community-based supervision, and recommended that Winkle be committed to the Department of Corrections for five years.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-4\">\u00b610 The District Court orally sentenced Winkle to five years in the Department of Correction\u2019s custody, recommended that he be placed in boot camp, and authorized Winkle to petition for a reduction in the sentence if he successfully completes boot camp. The court found Winkle had been \u201cunable to successfully follow the rules and conditions of this Court even during the time that these matters were pending\u201d and that it was unlikely Winkle would follow rules and conditions of probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">\u00b611 After the District Court orally pronounced sentence, Winkle\u2019s counsel requested a stay of imposition of sentence. He stated he thought a continuance should have been granted and he believed Winkle\u2019s due process rights had been violated by consideration of the letters from Woods; he asked the District Court to \u201cgrant the continuance\u201d at that time. The court denied the motion for a stay and remanded Winkle to the custody of the sheriff for execution of the sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-6\">\u00b612 In its written sentence, in addition to restating the sentence orally imposed, the District Court stated it had \u201cnot considered, in arriving at the sentence imposed herein, any information which does not accord the Defendant full process of law[.]\u201d Winkle appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b136-8\">\u00b613 Did the District Court violate Winkle\u2019s right to due process of law in sentencing him?</p>\n<p id=\"b136-9\">\u00b614  The due process clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Article II, Section 17, of the Montana <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>Constitution protect a defendant from being sentenced based on misinformation. Due process requires that an offender be given an opportunity to explain, argue and rebut any information, including presentencing information, that may lead to a deprivation of life, liberty or property. <em>State v. Allen, </em>2001 MT 266, \u00b6 18, 307 Mont. 253, \u00b6 18, 37 P.3d 655, \u00b6 18 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b137-4\">\u00b615 Winkle points out that, in <em>State v. Orsborn </em>(1976), 170 Mont. 480, 486, 555 P.2d 509, 513, we set forth three factors to be considered in determining whether the due process guarantee against sentencing misinformation has been violated: 1) whether the defendant was represented by counsel; 2) whether the defendant had the opportunity to rebut the information; and 3) whether the defendant affirmed or denied the charge. Winkle makes several Ors&amp;ora-related arguments which focus on the second factor-whether he had an opportunity to rebut the information. His major argument is that he did not have a reasonable opportunity to rebut, given the timing of the information, and that the District Court should have continued the sentencing hearing to permit him the necessary time to rebut the allegations.</p>\n<p id=\"An6\">\u00b616 There are several flaws in Winkle\u2019s argument. First, Winkle did, in fact, rebut the information by denying that he was living or cohabiting with the girl. His counsel asked that the court take his word on the denial. Second, Winkle\u2019s counsel did not request the continuance of the sentencing hearing that he seems to fault the court-and claim as a due process violation-for not granting. Indeed, counsel stated that \u201c[his] client would prefer not to rebut that and we\u2019ll just proceed to sentencing.\u201d Winkle\u2019s assertion that a continuance should have been granted, together with his first and only request for such a continuance, were made only after the District Court inquired whether there was any reason why sentence should not be imposed, received negative replies from both counsel, and proceeded to orally impose sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">\u00b617  The decision to grant or deny a motion for a continuance is within the sound discretion of a district court, and the timeliness of a motion to continue is a legitimate factor for the court to consider in determining whether to grant such a motion. <em>In re Marriage of Fishbaugh, </em>2002 MT 175, \u00b6 11, 310 Mont. 519, \u00b6 11, 52 P.3d 395, \u00b6 11 (citations omitted). Here, the motion for a continuance was clearly untimely because it was made after counsel twice indicated sentencing should proceed and, indeed, after the oral imposition of sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-6\">\u00b618 In this regard, Winkle asserts the District Court \u201cpreempted\u201d a motion to continue by stating, \u201cgiven ... Mr. Winkle\u2019s expressed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>difficulties of coming back and forth in between where he lives and where this Court has jurisdiction, that we probably ought to proceed to sentencing at this time.\u201d As Winkle correctly observes, however, the court\u2019s suggestion took Winkle\u2019s difficulties into account. It did not preclude or \u201cpreempt\u201d a continuance motion. In any event, as set forth above, Winkle\u2019s counsel stated later in the sentencing hearing that he \u201cwould prefer not to rebut that and we\u2019ll just proceed to sentencing\u201d and also advised the court there was no reason why sentence should not be imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-4\">\u00b619  When a criminal defendant contests matters in a presentence report, the defendant has an affirmative duty to present evidence establishing inaccuracies. If the defendant feels he or she has had insufficient time to bring in witnesses or other evidence to adequately rebut the contested information, the defendant should request a continuance. <em>State v. Trangsrud </em>(1982), 200 Mont. 303, 308, 651 P.2d 37, 40. We conclude Winkle\u2019s failure to timely move for a continuance precludes consideration of his additional, purely speculative, assertion that the sentencing court would have denied a timely motion had one been made.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-5\">\u00b620 Next, Winkle contends that the District Court relied on the letters in imposing the sentence and erred in doing so. This contention, too, is flawed. First, in its written sentencing order, the District Court stated it \u201chas not considered, in arriving at the sentence imposed herein, any information which does not accord the Defendant full process of law[.]\u201d On this record, the only such \u201cinformation\u201d to which the court could have referred are the letters and Woods\u2019 related testimony. The District Court having stated it did not consider the information, we will not assume otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-6\">\u00b621 Winkle also contrasts this case with <em>State v. D.B.S. </em>(1985), 216 Mont. 234, 700 P.2d 630, <em>overruled in part by State v. Olson </em>(1997), 286 Mont. 364, 951 P.2d 571, and <em>State v. Valcourt </em>(1992), 254 Mont. 174, 835 P.2d 753, by noting that, in those cases, the courts specifically stated they were deleting portions of the presentence report to which the defense objected. Winkle claims no such assurance was given him by the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-7\">\u00b622 It is true that the District Court did not expressly delete portions of the presentence investigation report or testimony. Nor, however, did Winkle expressly object to consideration of any of the information. Nothing in <em>D.B.S. </em>or <em>Valcourt </em>concludes, or even suggests, that a sentencing court must explicitly state the materials it is deleting or not considering, particularly where no specific objection to finite portions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>is made.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-4\">\u00b623 Winkle also argues in this regard that, notwithstanding the District Court\u2019s statement, \u201cit is clear the court relied upon the information contained in the letters.\u201d He points to the court\u2019s sentencing statements that it was clear he could not follow the rules while the case was pending and that he had been unable to \u201cfollow the directions of the Court to date.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">\u00b624 Woods\u2019 testimony, however, supports the District Court\u2019s reasoning on a basis independent of-and separate from-consideration of the letters, because Winkle failed in another way to follow the directions given him by the District Court. According to Woods, after Winkle entered his guilty plea, the court directed him to meet with Woods to prepare a presentence investigation. Winkle failed to complete the presentence investigation questionnaire Woods gave him or to call Woods to go over his answers to the questionnaire, as directed. In fact, Winkle never returned the questionnaire or a second copy Woods sent him. This testimony provides ample support for the District Court\u2019s determination that Winkle had been \u201cunable to successfully follow the rules and conditions of this Court even during the time that these matters were pending.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b139-6\">\u00b625  Winkle having failed to establish that the District Court relied on any misinformation or that he was not given an opportunity to explain, argue and rebut information that led to a deprivation of his liberty, we hold the District Court did not violate his right to due process of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-7\">\u00b626 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b139-8\">JUSTICES REGNIER, TRIEWEILER, COTTER and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
