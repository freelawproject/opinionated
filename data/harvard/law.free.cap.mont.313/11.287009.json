George appeals an order of the District Court for the Fifth Judicial District, Jefferson County, denying his motion to remove a fine from his sentence. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-9\">\u00b62 We address the following issue on appeal: Whether the District Court correctly found that the fine was due and owing.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-10\">Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b34-11\">\u00b63 On September 4,1997, George was charged by Information with criminal production or manufacture of dangerous drugs, a felony, in violation of \u00a7 45-9-110, MCA; criminal possession of dangerous drugs with intent to sell, a felony, in violation of \u00a7 45-9-103, MCA; and use or possession of property subject to criminal forfeiture, a felony, in violation of \u00a7 45-9-206, MCA. George filed an Acknowledgment of Rights and Pre-Trial Agreement on March 20, 1998. That same day, George pled guilty to the charge of criminal production or manufacture of dangerous drugs and the State moved to dismiss the remaining charges .</p>\n<p id=\"b34-12\">\u00b64 A sentencing hearing took place on July 20,1998. For the felony offense of criminal production or manufacture of dangerous drugs, the court sentenced George to a term of ten years with the Department of Corrections and ordered him to pay a fine of $5000. The court suspended five years of the ten-year sentence subject to George\u2019s continued supervision by Adult Probation and Parole and compliance with such rules as may be imposed, including continued counseling; remaining drug and alcohol free and voluntarily submitting to any confirming tests; and payment of his fine within three years of his release.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-13\">\u00b65 George applied to the Sentence Review Division of this Court for review of his sentence. His application for review was heard by the Sentence Review Board (the Board) on November 5, 1998. On November 30, 1998, the Board determined that the original sentence was contrary to \u00a7 46-18-201(l)(e), MCA (1997), which provided that whenever a person was found guilty of an offense, a district court may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>\u201ccommit the defendant to the department of corrections for a period not to exceed 5 years for placement in an appropriate correctional facility or program.\u201d Thus the Board amended George\u2019s sentence from a ten-year commitment to the Department of Corrections with five years suspended to a five-year commitment to the Department of Corrections with none of the time suspended .</p>\n<p id=\"b35-4\">\u00b66 George was paroled from the Montana State Prison on November 4,1999. On November 7, 2001, the State moved the District Court for an order to show cause why money owed to George for lost personal property should not be applied toward his unpaid fine. In his <em>pro se </em>response to the motion, George claimed that the fine was merely a condition of the suspended portion of the commitment. Hence, he argued that he was not bound to pay a fine or meet any of the other conditions required for a suspended sentence because the Board had eliminated the suspended portion of his sentence .</p>\n<p id=\"b35-5\">\u00b67 A show cause hearing was held on December 19, 2001. The State presented evidence concerning the lost property and George moved the District Court to remove the fine from the judgment. The court denied George\u2019s motion and ruled that George was required to pay the fine. The court awarded George credit toward the unpaid fine for the value of the lost property. George appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-6\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b35-7\">\u00b68 <em>Whether the District Court correctly found that the fine was due and owing.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b35-8\">\u00b69 George contends that the fine was a condition of his suspended sentence and, since his suspended sentence was negated, the fine should be removed. He relies on \u00a7 46-18-201(4)(e), MCA, which provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b35-9\">When deferring imposition of sentence or suspending all or a portion of execution of sentence, the sentencing judge may impose upon the offender any reasonable restrictions or conditions during the period of the deferred imposition or suspension of sentence. Reasonable restrictions or conditions imposed under subsection (l)(a) or (2) may include but Eire not limited to:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b35-10\">(e) payment of a fine as provided in 46-18-231;...</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b35-11\">\u00b610 George\u2019s argument is without merit. The fine imposed in the District Court\u2019s August 3, 1998 Findings, Judgment &amp; Sentence was not imposed as a condition of his suspended sentence, but rather, as a separate and independent condition of his sentence. The Findings, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>Judgment &amp; Sentence stated the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b36-4\">I. The Defendant SAM GEORGE is hereby sentence[d] to a term of ten years with the Department of Corrections, with credit for 9 days served in the County Jail.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b36-5\">II. <em>The Defendant is further assessed a fine of $5,000 </em>and the mandatory surcharge of $25.00, payable as hereinafter provided.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b36-6\">III. Five years of the ten year term is hereby SUSPENDED, subject however to the following conditions:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b36-7\">A. Continued supervision by Adult Probation and Parole and compliance with such rules as may be imposed, including continued counseling.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b36-8\">B. Remain drug and alcohol free and voluntarily submit to any confirming tests.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b36-9\">C. That he devise with his supervision parole officer a practical installment plan for the payment of his fine. The fine shall be paid in full within three years of his release. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b36-10\">\u00b611 As noted, the District Court\u2019s August 3, 1998 judgment did not make the fine itself conditional. The court suspended five years of George\u2019s sentence if he entered into an installment payment plan with his supervising officer. But, since the fine itself was not conditional on the suspended sentence, the Board\u2019s removal of the suspended sentence did not relieve George of his obligation to pay the fine.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-11\">\u00b612 Furthermore, while Montana law allows a sentencing court to impose a fine as a condition of a suspended sentence, \u00a7 46-18-201(3), MCA, also allows a sentencing court to commit a person to the Department of Corrections <em>and </em>impose a fine.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b36-12\">Whenever a person has been found guilty of an offense upon a verdict of guilty or a plea of guilty or nolo contendere, a sentencing judge may impose a sentence that may include:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b36-13\">(a) <em>a fine as provided by law for the offense;</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b36-14\">(c) a term of incarceration at a county detention center or state prison, as provided in Title 45, for the offense;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b36-15\">(d) commitment of:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b36-16\">(i) an offender not referred to in subsection (3)(d)(ii) to the department of corrections, with a recommendation for placement in an appropriate correctional facility or program; however, all but the first 5 years of the commitment to the department of corrections must be suspended; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b36-17\">(h) <em>any combination of subsections (2) through (3)(g).</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b37-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>Section 46-18-201(3), MCA (emphasis added). Similarly, \u00a7 46-18-231, MCA, specifically provides that a sentencing court may impose a fine \u201cin lieu of or in addition to a sentence of imprisonment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b37-4\">\u00b613 In this case, the District Court conditioned the suspended portion of George\u2019s sentence upon his entering into an installment plan for payment of the fine. The court did not place any conditions on the payment of the fine itself. Therefore, we hold that the District Court correctly determined that the Board\u2019s elimination of George\u2019s suspended sentence did not eliminate George\u2019s obligation to pay the fine.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-5\">\u00b614 George also contends that he did not have the ability to pay the fine while he was in prison, thus the fine was in violation of \u00a7 46-18-231(3), MCA, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b37-6\">The sentencing judge may not sentence an offender to pay a fine unless the offender is or will be able to pay the fine. In determining the amount and method of payment, the sentencing judge shall take into account the nature of the crime committed, the financial resources of the offender, and the nature of the burden that payment of the fine will impose.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b37-7\">\u00b615 The State points out that George never asserted prior to this appeal that the sentencing court failed to consider his ability to pay. Thus, the State argues that this issue is waived pursuant to <em>State v. Raugust, </em>2000 MT 146, \u00b6\u00b6 15, 17, 300 Mont. 54, \u00b6\u00b6 15, 17, 3 P.3d 115, \u00b6\u00b6 15, 17, and numerous other cases cited in the State\u2019s brief that hold that this Court will not address either an issue raised for the first time on appeal or a party\u2019s change in legal theory .</p>\n<p id=\"b37-8\">\u00b616 While the State is correct that the general rule is that the failure of a defendant to contemporaneously object waives the objection on appeal, this Court recently established a narrow exception to that general rule. In <em>State v. Brister, </em>2002 MT 13, \u00b6 16, 308 Mont. 154, \u00b6 16, 41 P.3d 314, \u00b6 16, we held that even if a defendant fails to contemporaneously object to his sentence at sentencing, we will accept jurisdiction of an appeal \u201cthat has been timely filed\u201d which alleges that a sentence is illegal or exceeds statutory authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-9\">\u00b617 George, however, did not timely appeal his sentence <em>(see </em>Rule 5(b), M.R.App.P.), thus the exception set forth in <em>Brister </em>does not apply in this case. George was originally sentenced on August 3, 1998. On August 7,1998, George applied to the Sentence Review Division of this Court for review of his ten-year commitment to the Department of Corrections. George never filed a direct appeal with this Court regarding his August 3, 1998 conviction or sentence. It was not until <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>three and one-half years later that George filed the current appeal with this Court and then only to appeal the District Court\u2019s December 19,2001 Order denying George\u2019s motion to have the fine removed from his judgment. Consequently, the issue of George\u2019s ability to pay the fine is waived and we will not address this issue further.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-4\">\u00b618 Accordingly, we hold that the District Court correctly found that the fine was due and owing. Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b38-5\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY and JUSTICES TRIEWEILER, LEAPHART and REGNIER concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
