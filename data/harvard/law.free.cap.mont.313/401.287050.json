United Harvest obtained an air quality permit from Respondent Department of Environmental Quality (\u201cDEQ\u201d) to build the facility. Appellant Pompeys Pillar Historical Association (\u201cAssociation\u201d) commenced administrative review proceedings in an effort to overturn the issuance of the permit. Ultimately, the Board of Environmental Review (\u201cBoard\u201d) affirmed DEQ\u2019s issuance of the permit.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-10\">\u00b62 The Association subsequently petitioned the First Judicial District Court, Lewis and Clark County, to review the Board\u2019s decision. The District Court dismissed the Association\u2019s petition for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. The Association appeals from the District Court\u2019s order of dismissal. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-11\">\u00b63 The sole issue on appeal is whether the District Court erred when it dismissed the Association\u2019s petition for review for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-12\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b424-13\">\u00b64 Pompeys Pillar is a national historic monument located approximately twenty-eight miles east of Billings, Montana. The Association is a non-profit organization which provides educational and administrative services to support the monument\u2019s preservation.</p>\n<p id=\"ABr\">\u00b65 Several years ago, United Harvest purchased land adjacent to Pompeys Pillar. United Harvest sought to construct a high speed grain loading terminal, consisting of silos, grain conveyors, grain elevators, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>truck scales, and a railroad loop track on this land. United Harvest intended to build this facility approximately one half to three-quarters of a mile from Pompeys Pillar.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-4\">\u00b66 Toward this end, United Harvest filed an application with DEQ for an air quality permit in August of 2000. In evaluating whether to issue the permit, DEQ conducted an initial and supplemental environmental assessment. The assessment evaluated the proposed facility\u2019s impact on the surrounding environment. DEQ concluded: (1) that the facility would not detrimentally impact the surrounding environment, more specifically the local air quality; and (2) that it was not necessary to issue an environmental impact statement. Therefore, on September 29, 2000, DEQ issued an air quality permit to United Harvest.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">\u00b67 In mid October 2000, the Association appealed the issuance of the permit to an administrative law judge. The appeal sought to overturn the issuance of the permit on the grounds that DEQ erred in its preparation of the environmental assessment. DEQ and United Harvest filed a motion to dismiss the administrative contested case hearing. The motion argued that the administrative law judge lacked jurisdiction to entertain the challenge and, instead, insisted that the Association should file the appeal in the appropriate district court. The administrative law judge denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">\u00b68 On June 28, 2001, the administrative law judge concluded that DEQ \u201cacted arbitrarily and capriciously... by issuing a permit without conducting an [environmental impact statement].\u201d Therefore, the judge recommended that the matter be remanded to DEQ for it to conduct the necessary evaluation. Notably, the findings did not address issues of air quality, but, instead, addressed the adequacy of the environmental assessment.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-7\">\u00b69 On July 12, 2001, United Harvest and DEQ filed exceptions to the administrative law judge\u2019s findings with the Board of Environmental Review. On August 9, 2001, the Board declined to implement the administrative law judge\u2019s recommendation and, instead, ordered DEQ to prepare a supplemental environmental assessment \u201caddressing noise impacts ... and the historic and cultural significance of the site.\u201d On October 24, 2001, following DEQ\u2019s submission of a supplemental environmental assessment, the Board concluded that DEQ did not act arbitrarily, capriciously, or unlawfully in conducting the relevant evaluations. Therefore, the Board affirmed DEQ\u2019s decision to issue the air quality permit.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-8\">\u00b610 On November 26, 2001, the Association petitioned the District Court to review the Board\u2019s decision. On February 14, 2002, DEQ <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>moved the District Court to dismiss the Association\u2019s petition on the grounds that the District Court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the case. Paralleling the argument it presented to the administrative law judge, DEQ maintained that the challenge presented to the administrative arbiters did not contain any air quality issues. DEQ contended that the administrative proceedings addressed environmental assessment issues only, which fall within the province of the Montana Environmental Policy Act (\u201cMEPA\u201d). According to DEQ, MEPA does not provide for administrative review of challenges to MEPA compliance. DEQ argued that challenges to MEPA compliance must be brought in district court. Therefore, as the administrative law judge and Board did not have jurisdiction to preside over the Association\u2019s appeal, DEQ asserted that the District Court lacked jurisdiction to review the administrative proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"ACXj\">\u00b611 Following a hearing on the matter, the District Court issued its Decision and Order on April 18,2002. Pursuant to the rationale offered by DEQ, the District Court dismissed the Association\u2019s petition for review for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. On May 28, 2002, the Association filed a notice of appeal from the District Court\u2019s order of dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-4\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b426-5\">\u00b612 A district court\u2019s determination that it lacks jurisdiction is a conclusion of law. <em>Threlkeld v. Colorado, </em>2000 MT 369, \u00b6 7, 303 Mont. 432, \u00b6 7, 16 P.3d 359, \u00b6 7. We review a district court\u2019s conclusions of law to determine whether the court\u2019s interpretation of the law is correct. <em>Carbon County v. Union Reserve Coal Co., Inc. </em>(1995), 271 Mont. 459, 469, 898 P.2d 680, 686.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b426-7\">\u00b613 Did the District Court err when it dismissed the Association\u2019s petition for review for lack of subject matter jurisdiction?</p>\n<p id=\"b426-8\">\u00b614 The Association maintains that \u00a7 75-2-211, MCA, authorizes an adversely affected party to appeal the approval or denial of an air quality permit to the Board of Environmental Review. Since the Association contends that it was entitled to an administrative contested case proceeding, it argues that it was subsequently entitled to judicial review of the administrative decision, pursuant to \u00a7 2-4-702, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-9\">\u00b615 According to the Montana Administrative Procedure Act (\u201cMAPA\u201d), an administrative agency must afford all parties a trial-type hearing in a \u201ccontested case.\u201d <em>See </em>\u00a7\u00a7 2-4-601, -612, MCA. MAPA <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>provides that a \u201ccontested case\u201d is \u201ca proceeding before an agency in which a determination of legal rights, duties, or privileges of a party is required by law to be made after an opportunity for hearing.\u201d Section 2-4-102(4), MCA. District courts maintain jurisdiction to review such contested case proceedings. <em>See </em>\u00a7\u00a7 2-4-701-702, MCA. Therefore, for purposes of this case, the critical inquiry is whether the Association was entitled by law to raise its specific challenge to the issuance of the air quality permit in a contested case proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-4\">\u00b616 The Clean Air Act of Montana, found at Title 75, Chapter 2, Parts 1-4, MCA, governs the issuance of air quality permits. Section 75-2-111(2), MCA, provides that \u201c[t]he board [of environmental review] shall ... hold hearings relating to any aspect of or matter in the administration of this chapter at a place designated by the board.\u201d \u201cThis chapter,\u201d referenced in \u00a7 75-2-111(2), MCA, refers to the Clean Air Act of Montana and the Asbestos Control Act, not MEPA. Further, \u00a7 75-2-211(10), MCA, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b427-5\">When [DEQ] approves or denies the application for a permit under this section, a person who is jointly or severally adversely affected by [DEQ\u2019s] decision may request a hearing before the board [of environmental review]. . . . The contested case provisions of the Montana Administrative Procedure Act, Title 2, chapter 4, part 6, apply to a hearing before the board [of environmental review] under this subsection.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b427-6\">Clearly, had the Association challenged DEQ\u2019s decision in regard to issues of air quality, it would have been entitled to pursue contested case proceedings. However, it did not do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-7\">\u00b617 The Legislature enacted MEPA to prevent or eliminate environmental damage as well as protect the right to use and enjoy private property free from undue governmental regulation. <em>See </em>\u00a7 75-1-102, MCA. MEPA requires that state agencies conduct environmental reviews when state action will significantly affect the quality of the human environment. Rule 17.4.607, ARM. \u201cEnvironmental review\u201d means any environmental assessment, environmental impact statement, or other written analysis conducted by a state agency to examine the impact of a proposed action on the quality of the human and physical environment. Section 75-1-220(4), MCA. State action encompasses a state agency\u2019s issuance of a lease, permit, license, certificate, or other entitlement for use or permission to act. Rule 17.4.603(1), ARM. Therefore, United Harvest\u2019s application for an air quality permit implicated state action and, thus, required DEQ to conduct an environmental review prior to its issuance.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-8\">\u00b618 Notably, the environmental review process is governed by MEPA <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>and its corresponding administrative rules, not the Clean Air Act of Montana. As stated in the District Court\u2019s order of dismissal, \u201cThe environmental assessment..., although conducted contemporaneously with the air quality review for the air quality permit, was not part of the air quality permit process itself ....\u201d As for the requisite environmental review process, Rule 17.4.607, ARM, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-4\">In order to determine the level of environmental review for each proposed action that is necessary to comply with 75-1-201, MCA, the agency shall apply the following criteria:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-5\">(1) The agency shall prepare an [environmental impact statement] as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-6\">(a) whenever an [environmental assessment] indicates that an [environmental impact statement] is necessary; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-7\">(b) whenever, based on the criteria in ARM 17.4.608, the proposed action is a maj or action of state government significantly affecting the quality of the human environment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b428-8\">Therefore, the environmental assessment acts, in part, as an initial evaluation to determine whether an agency must prepare an environmental impact statement. Rule 17.4.607(2)(c), ARM.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-9\">\u00b619 Here, DEQ conducted an environmental assessment in contemplation of the proposed facility\u2019s impact on the surrounding environment. Upon completion of the environmental assessment, DEQ deemed it unnecessary to issue an environmental impact statement. It is the issues surrounding the environmental assessment that the Association sought to challenge through contested case proceedings, i.e., the sufficiency of the environmental assessment and the decision not to issue an environmental impact statement. In fact, the Association requested the following relief from the District Court: \u201cThe Court is requested to remand the case under instructions to order [DEQ] to conduct an Environmental Impact Statement concerning the planned project of United Harvest ....\u201d Further, on appeal, the Association admits that it sought to challenge primarily \u201cthe sufficiency of [the] Environmental Assessment\u201d throughout the administrative proceedings. Therefore, as the environmental review process is governed by MEPA, we must look to the appellate procedures contained therein to determine whether the Association was entitled to administrative review of the issues presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-10\">\u00b620 Section 75-1-201(3), MCA (1999), provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-11\">(a) In any action challenging or seeking review of an agency\u2019s decision that ... [an environmental impact statement] is not required or that the statement is inadequate, the burden of proof is on the person challenging the decision. Except as provided in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>subsection (3)(b), in a challenge to the adequacy of a statement, a <em>court </em>may not consider any issue or evidence that was not first presented to the agency for the agency\u2019s consideration prior to the agency\u2019s decision. A <em>court </em>may not set aside the agency\u2019s decision unless it finds that there is clear and convincing evidence that the decision was arbitrary or capricious or not in compliance with the law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-4\">(b) When new, material, and significant evidence is presented to the <em>district court </em>that had not previously been presented to the agency for its consideration, the <em>district court </em>shall remand the new evidence back to the agency for the agency\u2019s consideration and an opportunity to modify its findings of fact and administrative decision before the <em>district court </em>considers the evidence within the administrative record under review.... The <em>district court </em>shall review the agency\u2019s findings and decision to determine whether they are supported by substantial, credible evidence within the administrative record under review. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b429-5\">Ironically, the Legislature amended this provision in 2001 to add, in part, the following language: \u201cA challenge to an agency action under this part may only be brought against a final agency action and may only be brought in district court or in federal court, whichever is appropriate.\u201d Section 75-l-201(6)(a), MCA. One of the representatives indicated that this provision was added to clarify the review process. Nevertheless, both parties agree that the 1999 version of the statute applies to the case at bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-6\">\u00b621  Section 75-1-201(3), MCA (1999), clearly envisions challenges to MEPA compliance before a \u201ccourt\u201d or \u201cdistrict court.\u201d MEPA does not contain a corollary to \u00a7 75-2-211(10), MCA, the contested case provision in the Clean Air Act of Montana. Had the Association simply challenged air quality issues, it would have been entitled to administrative proceedings. However, the Association admits that its challenge contemplated only those issues which pertained to the environmental assessment. Since MEPA governs environmental review, and since MEPA requires a party to bring a compliance challenge before a \u201ccomb\u201d or \u201cdistrict comb,\u201d the administrative law judge and Board did not have jurisdiction to hear the Association\u2019s challenge. As such, the District Court did not have jurisdiction to review the Board\u2019s determination. Consequently, the District Court did not err when it dismissed the Association\u2019s petition for review for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-7\">\u00b622 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b430-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES COTTER and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b430-4\">JUSTICE TRIEWEILER</author>\n<p id=\"AhI\">concurs.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-5\">\u00b623 Based on the arguments presented by the parties, I concur with the majority Opinion. However, in doing so, I do not express any opinion about the adequacy of the procedural due process provided for in the Montana Environmental Policy Act for challenging decisions made by the Department of Environmental Quality. Furthermore, I assume that because there was no time limit within which to commence a direct action pursuant to \u00a7 75-1-201(3), MCA (1999), that a direct action in district court can still be filed by Pompeys Pillar Historical Association challenging the adequacy of the environmental assessment prepared by the DEQ and that the merits of the Association\u2019s claims, as well as the adequacy of the due process afforded, can ultimately be resolved in that manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-6\">\u00b624 For these reasons, I concur with the majority Opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
