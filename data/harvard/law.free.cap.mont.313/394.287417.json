Beanblossom filed a motion to dismiss, alleging that the arresting officer failed to administer a breathalyzer test in violation of \u00a7 61-8-402(2), MCA, and in violation of his constitutional right to due process. The District Court for the County of Musselshell denied Beanblossom\u2019s motion, and a jury ultimately convicted him of the felony DUI charge. Beanblossom appeals the District Court\u2019s denial of his motion to dismiss. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-10\">\n<em>Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b417-11\">\u00b62 On March 15, 2001, Musselshell County Deputy Sheriff Jon Goffena, responded to a domestic disturbance call from Beanblossom\u2019s wife. On his way to the Beanblossom residence, Officer Goffena noticed Beanblossom pulling out of a gas station and onto the highway, heading in the direction of his residence. Goffena followed the vehicle for approximately 100 to 200 yards, during which time he observed the vehicle moving 10 to 15 miles an hour in a 25 mile per hour zone with its right-turn signal blinking. Officer Goffena decided to pull Beanblossom over before he reached home so that Goffena could investigate the domestic disturbance call and diffuse a potentially hazardous situation. When Goffena turned on his patrol lights, Beanblossom\u2019s vehicle made a \u201cbig swerve\u201d as it pulled over on the side of the highway.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-12\">\u00b63 As Officer Goffena approached the vehicle, he noticed that Beanblossom was \u201cforce-feeding himself corn nuts,\u201d and that the distinct odor of alcohol was on his breath. He asked Beanblossom to get out of his vehicle and directed him to step behind the vehicle. The investigation beside the patrol car was videotaped. According to Officer Goffena, Beanblossom acted in a threatening manner. Several times during the investigation, Beanblossom referred to a fight that had occurred earlier in the day with a woman. In describing the fight, Beanblossom emphatically swung his arms and demonstrated how the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>woman allegedly grabbed him, then pulled back and crooked his arm, as if to throw a punch. Officer Goffena testified that he felt \u201cpretty tense\u201d while he was dealing with Beanblossom because of \u201c[t]he screaming, the hollering, the look on his face, the actions that were going on\u201d and because Beanblossom \u201ckept crowding [his] space.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b418-4\">\u00b64 After the initial roadside investigation, Goffena took Beanblossom to the detention center where he read Beanblossom an implied consent advisory. This interview was also videotaped. In response to Goffena\u2019s question, \u201cWill you take a breath test?\u201d Beanblossom responded, \u2018Yeah.\u201d However, by that point, the officer was \u201cstressed,\u201d \u201ccompletely distracted,\u201d not \u201cpaying attention to what [he] was reading\u201d and did not administer the breath test even though Beanblossom had consented. Instead, Goffena marked the implied consent form to indicate that Beanblossom had refused the test. In fact, Officer Goffena testified that he did not realize that Beanblossom had actually consented to the breath test until the county attorney told him that it was on the video tape.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">\u00b65 Ultimately, Beanblossom was charged with DUI, which if convicted of, would have constituted his fourth DUI offense, a felony. Beanblossom, through counsel, filed a motion to dismiss the charge based on the officer\u2019s failure to administer the breath test, which Beanblossom contends would have been exculpating. After a hearing, the District Court denied the motion. Subsequently, a jury found Beanblossom guilty of DUI, and Beanblossom was sentenced to 13 months with the Department of Corrections and four years of probation. Beanblossom appeals the denial of his motion to dismiss. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-6\">\u00b66 Beanblossom presents the following issues on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b418-7\">\u00b67 1. WTiether the District Court erred in not granting Beanblossom\u2019s motion to dismiss?</p>\n<p id=\"b418-9\">\u00b68 2. WTiether Beanblossom\u2019s due process rights were violated when the arresting police officer failed to administer Beanblossom a breath test?</p>\n<p id=\"b418-10\">\n<em>Discussion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b418-11\">\u00b69 The grant or denial of a motion to dismiss in a criminal case is a question of law which is reviewed <em>de novo </em>on appeal. <em>State v. Hardaway, </em>2001 MT 252, \u00b6 64, 307 Mont. 139, \u00b6 64, 36 P.3d 900, \u00b6 64. This Court\u2019s standard of review is plenary, and we determine whether a district court\u2019s conclusion is correct. <em>Hardaway, </em>\u00b6 64.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>\n<em>Issue 1</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b419-4\">\u00b610 Whether the District Court erred in not granting Beanblossom\u2019s motion to dismiss?</p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">\u00b611 Appellant Beanblossom argues that the District Court erred in denying his motion to dismiss because Montana law, specifically \u00a7 61-8-402(2), MCA, mandates breath tests in cases where an officer suspects a person of driving under the influence of alcohol. Therefore, Beanblossom maintains that Officer Goffena\u2019s failure to administer a breath test violated the statutory mandate of \u00a7 61-8-402, MCA. He further asserts that Goffena\u2019s failure to administer him a breath test bars the State from prosecuting him for the DUI offense. Because the linchpin of Beanblossom\u2019s argument is that \u00a7 61-8-402(2), MCA, mandates breath tests in Montana, we first address whether this statute includes such a requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-6\">\u00b612  The resolution of this question involves Montana\u2019s implied consent statute, \u00a7 61-8-402(1), MCA, which provides that \u201c[a] person who operates or is in actual physical control of a vehicle upon the ways of this state open to the public is considered to have given consent to a test or tests of the person\u2019s blood or breath for the purpose of determining any measured amount or detected presence of alcohol or drugs in the person\u2019s body.\u201d Therefore, a person driving on a Montana highway is presumed to have consented to taking a breath test if an officer has reasonable grounds to believe that the person was under the influence of alcohol. If the driver withdraws his or her consent by refusing to take a breath test, the driver is subject to the immediate seizure of his or her driver\u2019s license, as well as possible suspension and revocation of the license. <em>See </em>\u00a7 61-8-402, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-7\">\u00b613 According to Beanblossom, subsection (2) of the implied consent statute mandates the administration of breath tests. This subsection provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-8\">[Breath] test or tests <em>must </em>be administered at the direction of a peace officer when: (i) the officer has reasonable grounds to believe that the person has been driving or has been in actual physical control of a vehicle upon ways of this state open to the public while under the influence of alcohol....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b419-9\">Section 61-8-402(2), MCA (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b419-10\">\u00b614 Beanblossom maintains that the word \u201cmust\u201d renders the statute mandatory and thus requires a peace officer to administer a breath test when he or she believes that a person has been driving while intoxicated. Therefore, Beanblossom asserts that Officer Goffena violated \u00a7 61-8-402(2), MCA, when he failed to give Beanblossom a breath test and that this violation in turn bars his prosecution of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>DUI offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-4\">\u00b615 The question of whether \u00a7 61-8-402(2), MCA, mandates breath tests is one of first impression for this Court. This issue, however, has been examined by courts outside of Montana, which have interpreted the mandatory language in similarly written statutes as identifying who may administer breath tests when, and if, a breath test is administered. In <em>State v. Entzel </em>(Wash. 1991), 805 P.2d 228, the Washington State Supreme Court considered whether that state\u2019s implied consent statute imposed a mandatory duty on police officers to offer breath tests to all persons accused of driving while under the influence. The <em>Entzel </em>court held that the statute did not impose a mandatory duty on peace officers to offer and administer breath tests to every person accused of driving while intoxicated. <em>See Entzel, </em>805 P.2d at 229-30. The court ruled that the statutory language merely designated who may administer the breath test. <em>See Entzel, </em>805 P.2d at 231. Importantly, the <em>Entzel </em>court noted that, \u201c[n]ationally, case law holding that implied consent statutes do not impose a duty on law enforcement to offer breath or blood tests has been remarkably consistent over several decades.\u201d <em>Entzel, </em>805 P.2d at 230, n.3 (listing cases).</p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">\u00b616 We agree with the interpretation of the implied consent statute articulated in <em>Entzel. </em>The breath test is merely a means of determining the level of intoxication. The statute does not make a breath test the exclusive means of proving intoxication. It is not, as Beanblossom suggests, a precondition to prosecution for DUI. The officer can, in his or her discretion, rely on other indicia of intoxication. The \u201cmust\u201d language of the statute refers to \u201cwho\u201d administers the test if, in the officer\u2019s discretion, a test is given. \u201cMust\u201d does not refer to \u201cwhether\u201d the test has to be administered.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-6\">\u00b617  Therefore, because \u00a7 61-8-402(2), MCA, merely mandates who may administer a breath test and does not require the administration of breath tests, we conclude that the District Court did not err in denying Beanblossom\u2019s motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-7\">\n<em>Issue 2</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b420-8\">\u00b618 Whether Beanblossom\u2019s due process rights were violated when the arresting police officer failed to administer Beanblossom a breath test?</p>\n<p id=\"AeI\">\u00b619  Next, we turn to Beanblossom\u2019s argument that his due process rights were violated by Officer Goffena\u2019s failure to administer a breath test, which Beanblossom contends would have been exculpating. Beanblossom directs this Court to previous decisions where we have ruled that when the alleged crime involves intoxication, the accused <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>has the right to obtain a sobriety test independent of that offered by the arresting officer. <em>See </em>\u00a7 61-8-405(2), MCA; <em>State v. Swanson </em>(1986), 222 Mont. 357, 722 P.2d 1155. Undoubtedly, Beanblossom had the right to request and receive an independent blood test. He did not, however, request a blood test. A violation of due process rights arises only when an accused has requested, but then is denied, an independent sobriety blood test.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-4\">\u00b620 For the reasons discussed above, we affirm the District Court\u2019s denial of Beanblossom\u2019s motion to dismiss.</p>\n<judges id=\"b421-5\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES COTTER, REGNIER, NELSON and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b421-6\">JUSTICE TRIEWEILER</author>\n<p id=\"AVT\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-7\">\u00b621 I dissent from the majority Opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-8\">\u00b622 The language of \u00a7 61-8-402, MCA, is both clear and mandatory. It provides, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b421-9\">(1) A person who operates or is in actual physical control of a vehicle upon ways of this state open to the public is considered to have given consent to a test or tests of the person\u2019s blood or breath for the purpose of determining any measured amount or detected presence of alcohol or drugs in the person\u2019s body.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b421-10\">(2) (a) The test or tests <em>must </em>be administered at the direction of a peace officer when:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b421-11\">(i) the officer has reasonable grounds to believe that the person has been driving or has been in actual physical control of a vehicle upon ways of this state open to the public while under the influence of alcohol,....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b421-12\">\u00b623 When construing a statute, this Court\u2019s role is to simply ascertain and declare what is in terms or in substance contained therein, not to put its own result-oriented spin on otherwise clear language. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1-2-101, MCA. Every child understands the meaning of \u201cmust,\u201d however, if there\u2019s any question, Webster\u2019s Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary defines it in part as \u201cb: be required by law, custom, or moral conscience ... to be obliged to . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b421-13\">\u00b624 In the past, we have held that when the state violates other testing requirements related to drivers suspected of driving under the influence of alcohol, the appropriate remedy is dismissal of the charges against the defendant. <em>See State v. Minkoff, </em>2002 MT 29, \u00b6 24, 308 Mont. 248, \u00b6 24, 42 P.3d 223, \u00b6 24. In that case, we concluded that the investigating officer frustrated a DUI suspect\u2019s right pursuant to 61-8-405(2), MCA, to gather an independent blood sample by warning the suspect that the sample would demonstrate a higher blood alcohol level than did the breath test administered by the investigating officer. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>If discouraging someone, while not prohibiting that person, from obtaining an independent blood test requires dismissal even though breathalyzer test results are already available, then it makes no sense to me why ignoring the plain and mandatory language requiring a test to measure the amount of alcohol in a person\u2019s body would not compel the same result.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-4\">\u00b625 Had the majority chosen to affirm the District Court\u2019s finding that Beanblossom frustrated the investigating officer\u2019s efforts to administer a breathalyzer or blood test, that would make some sense. However, the majority has ignored that issue. In the process, the majority has also chosen to ignore the plain language of the statute in favor of its own result-oriented approach and has demonstrated a propensity to selectively and randomly enforce those statutes which pertain to the administration of tests to those people who are suspected of driving under the influence of alcohol. The majority does so based on case law from other jurisdictions. However, when a statutory mandate is as clear as the language in \u00a7 61-8-402(2), MCA, case law from other jurisdictions is irrelevant and unnecessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-5\">\u00b626 The majority suggests in \u00b6 16 that, \u201c[T]he \u2018must\u2019 language of the statute refers to \u2018who\u2019 administers the test if, in the officer\u2019s discretion, a test is given. \u2018Must\u2019 does not refer to \u2018whether\u2019 the test has to be administered.\u201d The majority\u2019s strained interpretation deserves high marks for creativity but low marks for consistency, adherence to basic rules of grammar, or a willingness to enforce plain statutory language when doing so leads to an unpleasant result.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-6\">\u00b627 For these reasons, I dissent from the majority Opinion. I would reverse the judgment of the District Court and order that the charges against Beanblossom be dismissed for failure of the investigating officer to follow the plain language of \u00a7 61-8-402(2), MCA.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
