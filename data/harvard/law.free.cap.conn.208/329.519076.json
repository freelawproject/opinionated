J.</author>\n<p id=\"Anc\">This appeal involves the applicability of the doctrine of diplomatic immunity to an action for marital dissolution and equitable property distribution. The plaintiff, Barbara Fernandez, brought this dissolution action against her husband, the defendant Antonio Deinde Fernandez. Claiming diplomatic immunity by virtue of his status as an ambassador to the United Nations for the People\u2019s Republic of Mozambique, the defendant moved to dismiss the entire action for lack of personal jurisdiction.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The trial court denied the motion. We granted review pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 52-265a<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and we now uphold the judgment of the trial court and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">The complaint in this case invokes the equitable powers of the Superior Court for a variety of purposes. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>Principally, the plaintiff seeks a dissolution of her marriage to the defendant on the ground of irretrievable breakdown. Incident to the dissolution, the plaintiff requests an assignment \u201cof all of defendant\u2019s right, title and interest in certain real property located at 27 Oaley Lane, Greenwich, Connecticut.\u201d In addition, the plaintiff seeks a portion of the defendant\u2019s estate, support payments and attorneys\u2019 fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-6\">As this expedited appeal comes to us from the denial of a motion to dismiss, very little is known at this juncture about the parties to this suit. The complaint states that the plaintiff and defendant were married at Arlington, Virginia, on May 1, 1961. The parties allegedly separated in late 1984 or early 1985 when the defendant voluntarily left the marital home. A short time thereafter, but before the filing of the instant action, the defendant became Ambassador and Deputy Permanent Representative to the United Nations for the People\u2019s Republic of Mozambique.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-7\">At a hearing on the motion to dismiss, the plaintiff testified to the following alleged facts: The parties\u2019 three children were born in the United States and are above the age of majority. In 1974, the plaintiff and the defendant purchased real property at 27 Oakley Lane in Greenwich in the name of a Connecticut corporation, Santa Barbara Estates U.S.A., Inc. According to the plaintiff, she was the corporation\u2019s president and principal shareholder at the time of this purchase. Although the defendant traveled extensively from 1974 onward, he and the plaintiff occupied the Greenwich residence as husband and wife until his departure in late 1984 or early 1985.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b351-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>In tandem with the filing of her complaint, the plaintiff applied for an ex parte prejudgment remedy against the defendant. In a sworn affidavit accompanying her application, the plaintiff stated that the defendant is \u201can international businessman and diplomat\u201d who \u201chas admitted to being one of the richest men in Africa. He heads dozens of companies, and I believe his net worth exceeds $75 million.\u201d She further stated that, in her opinion, the defendant could easily sell or transfer assets that are relevant to her claims for relief. Of particular concern to the plaintiff was the Greenwich home where she resides with her youngest son. \u201cThis home is owned by Santa Barbara Estates U.S.A., Inc. This entity is controlled by my husband. I am afraid that my husband will use his influence to defeat my interest in the home.\u201d The trial court, <em>Novack, J., </em>granted the application, ordering, inter alia, that the plaintiff may attach, to the value of $8,000,000, the defendant\u2019s shares in Santa Barbara Estates U.S.A., Inc.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-4\">The trial court subsequently denied the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss the action. Although the court found that the defendant is a bona fide diplomat entitled to whatever protection international law affords, it rejected the defendant\u2019s claim of diplomatic immunity for two reasons. The court first held that the Superior Court has plenary jurisdiction over the defendant and his assets because the instant action is a \u201cfamily relations\u201d matter and not a \u201ccivil\u201d action. Only the filing of a \u201ccivil\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> action against diplomats is barred by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Alternatively, the court held that it at least had the authority to dissolve the marriage because of its in rem jurisdiction over the marital status of the parties. Even if the instant action is \u201ccivil\u201d and the Convention applies, the court held that Connecticut law gave it the power to enter a valid dissolution order without having personal jurisdiction over the defendant. <em>Litvaitis </em>v. <em>Litvaitis, </em>162 Conn. 540, 545, 295 A.2d 519 (1972). This latter holding dealt only with marital status; the court did not address the question of its authority to grant the plaintiffs claims for property distribution incident to dissolution.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-6\">After the filing of this appeal, the People\u2019s Republic of Mozambique executed a limited waiver, as is its prerogative under Article 32<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> of the Convention, permit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>ting the Superior Court \u201cto enter an order dissolving the marital status only\u201d between the plaintiff and the defendant.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Accordingly, a remand to the trial court for an adjudication of the marital status question will be necessary regardless of the outcome of this appeal. The only question before us is whether, on remand, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>trial court will have any authority to award the real and personal property the plaintiff claims in her complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-6\">The defendant urges us to answer this question in the negative for two reasons. He first maintains that the trial court erred in exempting this \u201cfamily relations\u201d action from the scope of \u201ccivil\u201d proceedings defined by the Convention. Citing treaty history, prior judicial decisions and general principles of diplomatic immunity, he claims that the trial court\u2019s restrictive view is contrary to international law and illustrates the type of parochialism that the Convention meant to eliminate. Second, the defendant claims that the instant action does not come within the express exception to diplomatic immunity that permits the filing of \u201ca real action relating to private immovable property\u201d owned by a diplomat. According to the defendant, this action is merely a divorce proceeding that could have ancillary consequences on real property; even if the in rem exception applies, the real estate at issue is exempt under a further Convention provision that immunizes the \u201cprivate residence\u201d of a diplomat. We agree with the first but not with the second of these claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b354-8\">We agree with the defendant that the instant action is \u201ccivil\u201d for purposes of establishing immunity under the Convention. As a matter of municipal<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> law, \u201c[a]n action for a divorce or a legal separation obviously is a civil action.\u201d <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>150 Conn. 15, 19, 183 A.2d 848 (1962). General Statutes \u00a7 46b-45 leaves no doubt that \u201c[a] proceeding . . . for . . . dissolution of marriage . . . shall be commenced by the service and filing of a complaint as in all other civil actions in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>the superior court . . . .\u201d The plaintiffs reliance on <em>Chieppo </em>v. <em>Robert E. McMichael, Inc., </em>169 Conn. 646, 363 A.2d 1085 (1975), is unavailing. In <em>Chieppo, </em>we held that an appeal to the Superior Court from a workers\u2019 compensation proceeding is not a \u201ccivil action\u201d within the meaning of the transfer statute then in effect. A key basis for this conclusion was that the legislature had created a special regime for the informal and expeditious resolution of compensation claims. Id., 651-54. There is no similar comprehensive administrative scheme relating to domestic relations. Contrary to the plaintiff\u2019s suggestion and the trial court\u2019s conclusion, the mere existence of separate Practice Book provisions pertaining to family matters does not rebut the strong inference, flowing from \u00a7 46b-45 as well as from <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>supra, that divorce proceedings are \u201ccivil\u201d actions under Connecticut law.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">Even if municipal law were equivocal on this question, controlling principles of international law dictate that the instant claim is a \u201ccivil\u201d action. Article 31 of the Vienna Convention provides that a \u201cdiplomatic agent shall enjoy immunity from the . . . civil and administrative jurisdiction\u201d of the receiving state. The negotiating history of the Convention supports a broad reading of this language. Sir Gerald Fitzmaurice, the special rapporteur who drafted the Convention under the auspices of the International Law Commission, explained that he \u201ccould not imagine a proceeding which would not fall under one of the three jurisdictions\u2014criminal, civil and administrative.\u201d 1 Y.B. Int\u2019l L. Comm\u2019n 147 (1958). Further, the record reveals an explicit awareness by the drafters that marital dissolution proceedings were prohibited by the Convention. One drafter noted that \u201c[t]he immunity of the diplomatic agent was maintained even in the . . . matter of divorce, because a divorce action under the local <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>jurisdiction was incompatible with his dignity as a diplomat.\u201d 1 Y.B. Int\u2019l L. Comm\u2019n. 97 (1957).</p>\n<p id=\"b356-6\">We therefore conclude that the trial court\u2019s assertion of jurisdiction under the aegis of \u201cfamily relations\u201d was erroneous. See also <em>Shaw </em>v. <em>Shaw, </em>3 All E.R. 1, 3, 3 W.L.R. 24 (1979) (construing Article 31 to bar divorce proceedings against an accredited diplomat). Our conclusion is consistent with case law in effect in this country prior to the entry into force of the Convention in 1972. In <em>Carrera </em>v. <em>Carrera, </em>174 F.2d 496, 498 (D.C. Cir. 1949), and <em>Tsiang </em>v. <em>Tsiang, </em>194 Misc. 259, 260, 86 N.Y.S.2d 556 (1949), the courts dismissed actions for marital separation on grounds of diplomatic immunity. Article 31 and its negotiating history therefore affirm the general principle that the Vienna Convention was meant to codify existing rules of customary international law. E. Denza, Diplomatic Law-Commentary on the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations (1976) p. 1. Prior decisions such as <em>Carrera </em>and <em>Tsiang </em>are strong evidence of the intent of the drafters of the Convention and the consequent meaning of Article 31 itself. Accordingly, the trial court erred in finding that this was not a \u201ccivil\u201d matter and that it had plenary power to adjudicate all facets of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b356-8\">Article 31 of the Convention immunizes a diplomatic agent from the civil jurisdiction of the receiving state \u201cexcept in the case of: (1) a real action relating to private immovable property situated in the territory of the receiving state, unless he holds it on behalf of the sending State for the purpose of the mission.\u201d The question that we must resolve is whether the plaintiff\u2019s claim to the title of the Greenwich home and real estate is cognizable under this exception to the rule of diplomatic immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>It is true, as the defendant emphasizes, that the plaintiffs claim arises in the context of a marital dissolution action. It is also true, as we noted earlier in this opinion, that such actions are normally barred by a diplomat\u2019s immunity from the \u201ccivil\u201d process of the receiving state. It is not necessarily true, however, that the generalized immunity conferred by the treaty prevails over the specific language of the in rem exception. To the contrary, we believe the in rem exception, as a particularized recognition of the receiving state\u2019s special interest in its land, reflects an intent to limit the generalized protection of Article 31 of the Convention. Whether such a result is mandated in the circumstances of this case depends on the precise meaning of the phrase \u201creal action relating to private immovable property.\u201d Since the plaintiff has raised a bona fide question regarding the applicability of the in rem exception, we must interpret the Convention as a whole to determine whether her claim is meritorious.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-6\">Before turning to the ultimate issue, however, we are mindful that, but for diplomatic immunity, the plaintiff\u2019s claim for real property incident to marital dissolution would readily be entertained by our courts. Domestic relations is \u201can area that has long been regarded as a virtually exclusive province of the States.\u201d <em>Sosna </em>v. <em>Iowa, </em>419 U.S. 393, 404, 95 S. Ct. 553, 42 L. Ed. 2d 532 (1975); <em>Carabetta </em>v. <em>Carabetta, </em>182 Conn. 344, 346, 438 A.2d 109 (1980). This plenary state power encompasses not only the regulation of marital status, but also the distribution of property and protection of offspring. <em>Williams </em>v. <em>North Carolina, </em>317 U.S. 287, 298-99, 63 S. Ct. 207, 87 L. Ed. 279 (1942). Federal courts decline to exercise jurisidiction over petitions for divorce or alimony, even where diversity of citizenship exists, out of respect for this zone of state authority. <em>Ohio ex rel. Popovici </em>v. <em>Agler, </em>280 U.S. 379, 383-84, 50 S. Ct. 154, 74 L. Ed. 489 (1930); <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number><em>Barber </em>v. <em>Barber, </em>62 U.S. (21 How.) 582, 16 L. Ed. 226 (1859). The plaintiff\u2019s claim for title to Connecticut real estate also invokes this state\u2019s \u201cstrong interests in assuring the marketability of property within its borders and in providing a procedure for peaceful resolution of disputes about the possession of that property . . . . \u201d <em>Shaffer </em>v. <em>Heitner, </em>433 U.S. 186, 208, 97 S. Ct. 2569, 53 L. Ed. 2d 683 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b358-6\">It is nevertheless a basic tenet of treaty law that binding agreements are to be respected and enforced (\u201cpacta sunt servanda\u201d). M. Janis, An Introduction to International Law (1987) pp. 8-11. In particular, the state interest in furnishing a judicial forum in this case is subject to the supremacy of a binding treaty commitment of the United States government. U.S. Const., art. VI, \u00a7 2; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Belmont, </em>301 U.S. 324, 331, 57 S. Ct. 758, 81 L. Ed. 1134 (1937); <em>Missouri </em>v. <em>Holland, </em>252 U.S. 416, 434, 40 S. Ct. 382, 64 L. Ed. 641 (1920). In giving priority to a binding treaty, we must interpret the treaty in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning of its terms and in the light of its object and purpose. 1 Restatement (Third), The Foreign Relations Law of the United States (1987) \u00a7 325. \u201cInterpretation . . . must, of course, begin with the language of the Treaty itself. The clear import of the treaty language controls unless \u2018application of the words of the treaty according to their obvious meaning effects a result inconsistent with the intent or expectations of its signatories.\u2019 \u201d <em>Sumitomo Shoji America, Inc. </em>v. <em>Avagliano, </em>457 U.S. 176, 180, 102 S. Ct. 2374, 72 L. Ed. 2d 765 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b358-7\">Article 31 clearly sets forth an exception to diplomatic immunity for any \u201creal action relating to private immovable property.\u201d The concept of excluding actions relating to real property from the scope of diplomatic immunity was firmly entrenched prior to the adoption of the Convention. See generally 2 Y.B. Int\u2019l L. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>Comm\u2019n 78, 98 (1958); E. Denza, supra, pp. 154-56; C. Wilson, Diplomatic Privileges and Immunities (1967) p. 107; B. Sen, A Diplomat\u2019s Handbook of International Law and Practice (2d Ed. Rev. 1979) p. 111; <em>Anonymous </em>v. <em>Anonymous, </em>44 Misc. 2d 14, 19, 252 N.Y.S.2d 913 (1964). In a position paper prepared in 1961 for the United States delegation to the negotiating conference for the Convention, the Department of State recognized the historic validity of the real property exception: \u201cIt is axiomatic that real property other than that owned by the sending State and used for diplomatic purposes, is within the exclusive jurisdiction of the state in which it is located. Moreover, since actions respecting real property are usually <em>in rem, </em>it cannot be argued that an action affecting real property held by a diplomatic agent for non-diplomatic purposes will interfere with the proper performance of his diplomatic functions.\u201d 7 M. Whiteman, Digest of International Law (1970) p. 407.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-6\">Turning to the specific meaning of the treaty in this case, we face a question of first impression concerning the intended scope of the language of the exception. The parties submit divergent interpretations. According to the plaintiff, her claim for ownership of the Greenwich home, even though it arises in the context of a dissolution proceeding, falls within the plain meaning of the exception. The defendant, on the other hand, argues that the plaintiff\u2019s position, if adopted, would eviscerate the treaty. He maintains that a litigant could evade the broad immunity of the treaty by attaching the real property of a diplomat in order to satisfy an unrelated <em>in personam </em>judgment. Such a maneuver would, according to the defendant, enable a litigant to \u201calchemize\u201d a run-of-the-mill tort dispute into one \u201crelating to private immovable property\u201d within the meaning of the treaty, thereby defeating the intent of the signatories.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>We are persuaded by the plaintiff that the treaty allows her claim for ownership of the family residence to be heard in this case, in which the sending state has waived any claim of immunity with regard to the dissolution of the marriage.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> We rely on two principal grounds for our conclusion. First, the language of the exception eschews any technical focus on the <em>form </em>of action brought and instead raises the sole question of whether the real property is <em>itself the </em>disputed object of the litigation. Despite the absence of published cases construing the provision or any discussion by the drafters of the meaning of \u201creal action,\u201d we are not entirely without interpretive guidance. A leading commentator has defined the exception thus: \u201cThe essence of the term \u2018real action\u2019 is that the relief sought is either a declaration of title to the property, an order for sale by authority of the court, or an order for possession. The term is used in the sense of an action in rem . . . . \u201d E. Denza, supra, pp. 159-60. An identical conclusion was reached by a second commentator: \u201c[A] real action is an action where ownership or possession of immovable property is claimed.\u201d E. Satow, Guide to Diplomatic Practice (5th Ed. 1979) \u00a7 15.13, p. 125.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-6\">The express terms of the treaty, as construed, thus support a conclusion that the Superior Court has jurisdiction over the defendant for the purpose of adjudicating the plaintiff\u2019s claim of ownership of the Greenwich home. The very object and purpose of the plaintiff\u2019s complaint is a vindication of her claimed right of ownership of the real estate. The substance of her claim is that she is entitled to the home as an immediate and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>essential consequence of her marital dissolution. This is simply not a case where the plaintiff seeks to satisfy a collateral judgment in her favor by forcing the sale or transfer of unrelated real property. Under the latter circumstances, the defendant\u2019s concern for the evisceration of the treaty might be well-founded. When the complaint alleges a direct right of ownership of the thing itself, however, such a concern finds no basis in law or fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-6\">Second, the overriding emphasis of the Convention is functional. The preamble states the general principle that \u201cthe purpose of such privileges and immunities is not to benefit individuals but to ensure the efficient performance of the functions of the diplomatic missions.\u201d The functional approach of the Convention is a departure from the two classical theories of diplomatic immunity. One theory posited that the diplomat was the personification of the sending state and therefore entitled to the highest dignity. Another theory rested on the legal fiction that the diplomat was always on the soil of the sending state, wherever he or she might actually go, and therefore was extraterritorially immune from process. See generally B. Sen, supra, pp. 80-81; C. Wilson, supra, pp. 1-16. Both theories contained an inflexible presumption of immunity for protected diplomats.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-7\">The Vienna Convention, on the other hand, adopted a theory that justifies immunity by the need to safeguard the actual functioning of the diplomatic mission. C. Wilson, supra, pp. 17-25. \u201cThe functional approach is not merely an academic rationale. During the formulation of the Vienna Convention it guided the makers at every crucial point. The general result was to tighten the protection given to the mission itself\u2014its premises, its communications, its property, its archives and the inviolability of its senior members.\u201d E. Denza, supra, p. 5. Although we do not view the functional approach <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>as an open invitation to disregard the doctrine of diplomatic immunity, the Convention itself imposes limitations on the scope of immunity in order to minimize abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-6\">This functional theory had a specific ramification in the drafting of the in rem exception. \u201c[A] real attempt has been made to strike a balance between the need to protect a diplomat in regard to official matters and to guard him from the harassment of frivolous lawsuits and the conflicting need to minimise abuse of immunity by diplomats in regard to matters which have nothing to do with their job and to provide a forum for those cases involving land where a plaintiff might otherwise have no other.\u201d E. Denza, supra, p. 4. The drafters\u2019 sense of balance is reflected by the narrow scope of the in rem exception. It does not expose to municipal jurisdiction any real property held by the diplomat \u201con behalf of the sending State for purposes of the mission\u201d; Vienna Convention, Article 31 (a); or the \u201cprivate residence of a diplomatic agent.\u201d Id., Article 30 (1). The exception thus represents a studied effort by the drafters to balance the competing factors of national sovereignty over land and diplomatic inviolability.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-7\">On remand, then, it is for the trial court to determine whether to grant the plaintiff title to the disputed real property. The defendant argues that his interest in the family home is immune from jurisdiction as the \u201cprivate residence of a diplomatic agent\u201d pursuant to Article 30 of the Convention.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> On the record before us, we are unable to resolve this claim. The trial court made no findings of fact on the question of whether the defendant continues to maintain his \u201cprivate residence\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>at the Greenwich home. It is possible that the defendant vacated the home not intending to return and therefore no longer resides there. See, e.g., <em>Agbor </em>v. <em>Metropolitan Police Commissioner, </em>2 All E.R. 707, 1 W.L.R. 703 (1969). We, of course, express no view on the merits of this factual question.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b363-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b363-7\">The final question is whether, on remand, the trial court will have authority to award the plaintiff support payments and whatever ancillary monetary relief seems appropriate. In support of jurisdiction over her claims, the plaintiff relies not on a specific treaty provision, as was the case regarding real property, but instead on her alleged due process right of access to a judicial forum for a resolution of all disputes arising out of a marital dissolution. She maintains that the residual immunity conferred upon the defendant in this case must give way to her right of access guaranteed by the fourteenth amendment to the United States constitution. See <em>Boddie v. Connecticut, </em>401 U.S. 371, 377-79, 91 S. Ct. 780, 28 L. Ed. 2d 113 (1971).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b363-8\">This claim raises serious concerns about the interrelationship of two equally valid federal laws: constitutional principles safeguarding individual rights and treaty provisions preserving the inviolability of diplomatic agents. As a general rule, a treaty provision that contravenes \u201cany of the prohibitions or limitations of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>the Constitution applicable to the exercise of authority by the United States\u201d is null and void. 1 Restatement (Third), The Foreign Relations Law of the United States (1987) \u00a7 302 (2). The United States Supreme Court has \u201cregularly and uniformly recognized the supremacy of the Constitution over a treaty.\u201d <em>Reid </em>v. <em>Covert, </em>354 U.S. 1, 17, 77 S. Ct. 1222, 1 L. Ed. 2d 1148 (1957). The reason for this rule is that the federal government, as a creature of the constitution, must exercise its authority within the limitations proscribed by its charter.

We think not. The focus of the Supreme Court in <em>Boddie </em>was squarely on the \u201cfundamental human relationship\u201d of marriage. <em>Boddie </em>v. <em>Connecticut, </em>supra, 383. \u201cThe denial of access to the judicial forum in <em>Boddie </em>touched directly ... on the marital relationship and on the associational interests that surround the establishment and dissolution of that relationship.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Kras, </em>409 U.S. 434, 444, 93 S. Ct. 631, 34 L. Ed. 2d 626 (1973). The plaintiff offers no direct authority to the contrary and we have found none. We therefore decline to expand the holding of <em>Boddie </em>beyond its factual boundaries of the marital status.

I agree with the majority that the trial court had jurisdiction to adjudicate and protect the present interest of the plaintiff in the Greenwich residence, assuming that the property does not qualify as the \u201cprivate residence of a diplomatic agent,\u201d a factual issue yet to be determined in the trial court. I disagree, however, with the implications of the majority opinion that the court upon remand would have jurisdiction to transfer to the plaintiff all or part of the defendant\u2019s interest in the residence simply because her claim of a present interest in that real estate is joined with her claim for a dissolution of her marriage. I also would find error in the failure of the trial court to dismiss all of the plaintiff\u2019s claims for relief that specifically invoke the authority of the court under our marital dissolution statutes to assign property and to grant other relief as adjuncts to a marital dissolution.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b365-8\">The majority opinion appears to concede<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> that the plaintiff\u2019s action for dissolution of her marriage, at the time the trial court denied the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss, was barred by the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations, because \u201cthe record reveals an explicit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>awareness by the drafters that marital dissolution proceedings were prohibited by the Convention.\u201d The fact that, after the appeal was filed, a limited waiver of the defendant\u2019s diplomatic immunity was executed to permit only dissolution of the marital status of the parties renders that determination of the trial court moot. Because the waiver is effective only for the purpose of dissolving the marriage, however, it cannot serve as a vehicle upon which to predicate any of the relief normally attendant upon a dissolution of marriage under our statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-6\">The prayer for relief of the complaint in this action seeks, in addition to a dissolution of the marriage, the following remedies: (1) \u201c[a]n assignment of a portion of the defendant\u2019s estate in accordance with [General Statutes] \u00a7 46b-81\u201d; (2) \u201c[a]n assignment to the plaintiff of all of defendant\u2019s right, title and interest in certain real property located at 27 Oakley Lane, Greenwich, Connecticut, pursuant to [General Statutes] \u00a7 46b-81\u201d; (3) \u201c[Reasonable support pursuant to [General Statutes] \u00a7 46b-82\u201d; (4) \u201c[Reasonable attorney\u2019s fees in accordance with [General Statutes] \u00a7 46b-62\u201d; and (5) \u201c[s]uch other, further, and different relief as the court may deem proper.\u201d This cornucopia of demands appears to have been overlooked by the majority in declaring that \u201c[t]he very object and purpose of the plaintiff\u2019s complaint is a vindication of her claimed right of ownership of the real estate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b366-7\">As I understand the majority opinion, however, it concludes that the only relief a court of this state has jurisdiction to grant, in view of the assertion of the defendant\u2019s immunity even as modified by the waiver, is that which would be appropriate under the exception in the Convention for \u201ca real action relating to private immovable property.\u201d Since the only immovable property of the defendant in this state disclosed by the record is the residence in Greenwich occupied by both <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>parties until the defendant\u2019s departure, the jurisdiction of the trial court under the \u201creal action\u201d exception would necessarily be limited to adjudicating the present interests of the parties in that real estate. Accordingly, as the majority opinion holds, the plaintiff\u2019s claims with respect to any other property of the defendant or for such monetary relief as alimony under General Statutes \u00a7 46b-82 or attorney\u2019s fees under General Statues \u00a7 46b-62, cannot be pursued in this state. Thus, even under the majority view, the prayers seeking such relief should be dismissed because the court has no jurisdiction over the defendant to grant such relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-6\">The majority opinion, referring to the Greenwich residence, declares that \u201c[t]he substance of [the plaintiff\u2019s] claim is that she is entitled to the home as an immediate and essential consequence of her marital dissolution.\u201d Because the restricted waiver of the defendant\u2019s immunity permits only the dissolution of the marriage, however, I believe the power of the court under the \u201creal action\u201d exception to determine the interests of the parties in the residence cannot be deemed to include the authority given under General Statutes \u00a7 46b-81 to a court when dissolving a marriage to \u201cassign to either the husband or the wife all or any part of the estate of the other,\u201d which the plaintiff has expressly invoked in her prayer for relief, as the quotation from the majority opinion implies. The authority to transfer property of one spouse to another under \u00a7 46b-81 is plainly limited to actions for dissolution or annulment of marriage or for legal separation. The court, \u201c[i]n fixing the nature and value of the property, if any, to be assigned,\u201d is directed to consider \u201cthe length of the marriage, the causes for the . . . dissolution of the marriage . . . the age, health, station, occupation, amount and sources of income, vocational skills, employability, estate, liabilities and needs of each of the parties and the opportunity of each for future acquisition of capital assets and income.\u201d If the court were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>to exercise the authority to assign the defendant\u2019s interest in the residence to the plaintiff pursuant to \u00a7 46b-81, as she seeks, the concern of the Convention that the immunity of a diplomat be preserved in a divorce action because such a proceeding \u201cunder the local jurisdiction was incompatible with his dignity as a diplomat\u201d would be wholly frustrated. 1 Y.B. Int\u2019l L. Comm\u2019n 97 (1957).</p>\n<p id=\"b368-6\">As her claim is summarized in the majority opinion, the plaintiff maintains \u201cthat she is entitled to the home as an immediate and essential consequence of her marital dissolution.\u201d She would, however, be barred by the Convention and the limited terms of the defendant\u2019s waiver from enhancing whatever interest in the residence she may presently possess by relying upon the circumstance that the adjudication of the interests of the parties may be made in the context of a marital dissolution proceeding. In my view, therefore, the plaintiff\u2019s claim for the relief of \u201can assignment of all of the defendant\u2019s interest in [the residence] pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 46b-81\u201d should be dismissed as beyond the jurisdiction of the court when diplomatic immunity has been raised, together with her other claims for relief that are unrelated to the residence, which the majority opinion concedes are not viable in this state.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b368-8\">The complaint in this action contained, in addition to standard allegations relating to the dissolution of the marriage, the following paragraph: \u201cThe parties are the equitable and beneficial owners of real property located at 27 Oakley Lane in Greenwich, Connecticut.\u201d The prayer for relief, which contains separate claims for specific statutory remedies as adjuncts to the dissolution, also includes a claim for general equitable relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-9\">An affidavit of the plaintiff filed in support of her application for a prejudgment remedy asserts that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>Greenwich residence is owned by a Connecticut Corporation, Santa Barbara Estates U.S.A., Inc. At the hearings on the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss, the plaintiff testified that in 1974, when the home was purchased, she was the majority shareholder of the corporation. She also testified that in 1986, without her knowledge and consent, the defendant had managed to have title to the residence transferred to his name. This testimony lends some substance to the allegation of the complaint that the plaintiff has an equitable interest in this real estate for which the complaint may be construed to seek an adjudication under the general equitable powers of the court, quite apart from the remaining allegations and prayers for relief that relate wholly to the dissolution action. The complaint, therefore, may be viewed to include a claim for a \u201cdeclaration of title to the property\u201d with attendant equitable relief that undoubtedly would qualify under the Convention as \u201ca real action relating to private immovable property.\u201d E. Denza, Diplomatic Law\u2014Commentary on the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations (1976) pp. 159-60. Although the assertion of this claim as an independent ground upon which to proceed against the defendant would have been more readily apparent had it not been intermingled with the claims that are related solely to the dissolution, the jurisdiction of the court does not depend on the niceties of pleading. \u201cIt is the fact of jurisdiction, not the way in which it is made to appear, which is the vital thing.\u201d <em>Artman </em>v. <em>Artman, </em>111 Conn. 124, 126, 149 A. 246 (1930). The record adequately discloses that the plaintiff does claim to have an interest in real estate adverse to that of the defendant which she seeks to have determined and to protect.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> That claim plainly falls within the \u201creal action\u201d exception of the Convention.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>I conclude therefore, that the trial court erred in failing to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction all of the plaintiffs claims that expressly invoke the authority of the court under our marital dissolution statutes to grant relief beyond the dissolution of the marriage itself, a remedy to which the defendant\u2019s waiver expressly assents. I agree with the majority that the trial court acquired jurisdiction under the complaint to determine the interest of the plaintiff in the Greenwich residence, unless that residence constitutes the \u201cprivate residence of a diplomatic agent\u201d under the Convention, a question to be resolved upon the remand. I disagree, however, with the implicit view of the majority opinion that the interest she presently possesses may somehow be enhanced as a result of the marital dissolution or that the court may assign all or part of the defendant\u2019s interest in the residence to her pursuant to \u00a7 46b-81.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-6\">Accordingly, I dissent in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b365-9\"> In Part III of the majority opinion the claim of the plaintiff that she has a right of access to the courts under the fourteenth amendment to the United States constitution for the purpose of dissolving her marriage, relying upon <em>Boddie </em>v. <em>Connecticut, </em>401 U.S. 371, 377-79, 91 S. Ct. 780, 28 L. Ed. 2d 113 (1971), is rejected insofar as the plaintiff asserts that right as a basis for the additional relief she seeks as an adjunct to the dissolution. Because the waiver of diplomatic immunity in respect to the dissolution itself makes it unnecessary to decide whether <em>Boddie </em>has created a constitutional right to a dissolution of marriage, absent the element of discrimination against the poor that was present in that case, the majority opinion has left the constitutional question unresolved.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b369-6\"> The majority opinion in footnote 11 maintains that this ground for jurisdiction was not raised on appeal. The plaintiffs brief, however, concludes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>its discussion of the <em>in rem, </em>exception as follows: \u201cThe instant action, which has as an essential aspect thereof the adjudication of plaintiffs equitable rights <em>and even title ownership interest </em>in a piece of Connecticut real property falls squarely within the real property exception to the Vienna Convention.\u201d (Emphasis added.) In any event, \u201cthis court is not limited in its disposition of a case to claims raised by the parties and has frequently acted sua sponte upon grounds of which the parties were not previously apprised.\u201d <em>Greenwood </em>v. <em>Greenwood, </em>191 Conn. 309, 315, 464 A.2d 771 (1983). This practice has commonly been followed with respect to jurisdictional issues such as those presented in this appeal. <em>Cahill </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>198 Conn. 229, 238, 502 A.2d 410 (1985).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
