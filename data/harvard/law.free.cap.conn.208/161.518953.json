Healey, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AaQ\">This appeal arises out of an action by the plaintiff, Virginia N. Gordon, conservatrix of the estate of her brother, Arthur R. Navarette, an incapable, for injuries that he suffered in a beating at the Marina Apartments housing project in Bridgeport. The defendants include the city of Bridgeport, the Bridgeport housing authority (BHA), commissioners Stephen Katz, Clarence T. Williams, Jeri Boyd, Gino Cassidy and Raymond J. Alletto of the BHA, former mayor Leonard S. Paoletta, Sr., chief of police Joseph A. Walsh, and the Bridgeport police department. The defendant city of Bridgeport filed a motion to strike the third and fourth counts of the plaintiff\u2019s complaint. The trial court, <em>Ripley, J., </em>granted the motion as to the defendants Paoletta, Walsh, the city of Bridgeport and the Bridgeport police department and the plaintiff filed this appeal. We find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-8\">The pleadings in the case reveal the following background facts. In the early evening hours on November 26,1983, Navarette stopped at a convenience store at 321 Main Street near the Marina Apartments housing project. Navarette encountered a group of youths and one youth forcibly grabbed Navarette\u2019s wallet and fled into the project. Two other youths lured Navarette inside the project on the pretext that they would help him recover the wallet. The youths then pulled Navarette under a dark stairwell inside a building in the project and physically beat him with their fists, feet, bottles <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>and blunt instruments just \u201cshort of death.\u201d Navarette was admitted to Park City Hospital in a \u201cbrain dead\u201d condition. As a result of the attack, Navarette, who currently resides at New Britain Memorial Hospital, is catastrophically brain injured and will require permanent skilled and custodial institutional care for the remainder of his life.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">The plaintiff filed a four count complaint against the various defendants. The first count alleges that the BHA and the city of Bridgeport were negligent in managing and in providing security to the housing project. It also alleges that the BHA, operating in its capacity as managing agent for the city, is guilty of gross mishandling and misappropriation of funds. The second count names the individual members of the housing authority as defendants and alleges theories of negligence similar to those asserted in the first count. Neither the first nor the second count is the subject of this appeal. The third count names Paoletta and the city as defendants while the fourth count names Walsh, the police department and the city as defendants. The essence of the third and fourth counts of the complaint, referring to a \u201cCooperation Agreement\u201d between the BHA and the city concerning the providing of the \u201cusual municipal services\u201d to the project, is that the defendants negligently created a condition conducive to crime and failed to provide adequate security at the housing project. It is also alleged that the foregoing breaches violated General Statutes \u00a7 47a-7 (a) (2) and (3)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (duty of a landlord to keep premises in a safe and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>habitable condition) and General Statutes \u00a7 47a-54d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> (duty of a landlord to maintain interior lighting). The defendant city filed a motion to strike counts three and four of the complaint on the ground that the city and its employees owed no duty to Navarette. The trial court, <em>Ripley, J., </em>granted the motion to strike, holding that the defendant city et al. owed no duty to provide police protection to Navarette, because he was an unidentifiable person within the meaning of <em>Shore </em>v. <em>Stonington, </em>187 Conn. 147, 444 A.2d 1379 (1982). The trial court\u2019s memorandum of decision also found that the city had no duty to maintain lights and other security devices because the BHA is an independent body \u201ccorporate and politic\u201d and therefore is not an agency of the city.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">The plaintiff claims that: (1) the trial court erred in ruling that the city and its representatives owed no duty to Navarette as a matter of law; (2) the complaint sufficiently pleaded facts which, if proved, would give rise to a ministerial or \u201coperational\u201d construction of the city\u2019s duty; (3) the trial court erred in ruling as a matter of law that the city did not stand in an agency relationship to the BHA; (4) even if the city\u2019s duty is discretionary, the city\u2019s acts of undertaking certain obligations created a duty to a foreseeable class of persons; and (5) this court should abrogate the public duty doctrine. We conclude that none of the plaintiff\u2019s claims is persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b182-7\">Although the plaintiff raises five separate claims, her first, second, fourth and fifth claims relate to the issue <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>of whether the defendants owed a duty to Navarette and whether, under the facts well pleaded, the defendants could be held liable for negligently performing that duty.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">The first claim concerns whether the trial court erred in ruling that the city and its representatives owed no duty to Navarette as a matter of law. The plaintiff, however, asserts that there is a threshold inquiry in the area of municipal liability\u2014deciding if the official acts or omissions are ministerial or discretionary\u2014and because that is a question for the trier of fact, it is inappropriate to decide the issue on a motion to strike. The plaintiff relies heavily on a statement in <em>Gauvin </em>v. <em>New Haven, </em>187 Conn. 180, 186, 445 A.2d 1 (1982), that \u201c[w]hether the acts complained of in operating a city park were governmental or ministerial is a factual question which depends upon the nature of the act complained of.\u201d The plaintiff also refers to <em>Sestito </em>v. <em>Groton, </em>178 Conn. 520, 528, 423 A.2d 165 (1979), <em>Tango v.New Haven, </em>173 Conn. 203, 204, 377 A.2d 284 (1977), and a number of Superior Court cases that hold, on varying fact patterns, that the issue of governmental immunity is a question of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-7\">Before reaching the precise issue before us on this claim, it is instructive to outline briefly the doctrine of municipal immunity in Connecticut. A municipality itself was generally immune from liability for its tortious acts at common law; <em>Ryszkiewicz </em>v. <em>New Britain, </em>193 Conn. 589, 593, 479 A.2d 793 (1984); but its employees faced the same personal tort liability as private individuals. \u201cIt was once said that as a general rule governmental officers and employees were personally liable for their torts, more or less without exception, even where the governmental unit itself was protected by an immunity.\u201d W. Prosser &amp; W. Keeton, Torts (5th Ed. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>1984) \u00a7 132, p. 1056, see also G. Bermann, \u201cIntegrating Governmental and Officer Tort Liability,\u201d 77 Colum. L. Rev. 1175, 1178 (1977); 63A Am. Jur. 2d, Public Officers and Employees \u00a7 358 (1984). This court first adopted a version of qualified official immunity in 1920 in <em>Wadsworth </em>v. <em>Middletown, </em>94 Conn. 435, 439, 109 A. 246 (1920), where we said that since certain public officials were \u201cengaged upon a governmental duty ... so long as they act in good faith, in the exercise of an honest judgment, and not in the abuse of their discretion, or maliciously or wantonly, they cannot be held liable.\u201d Thus, an exception to liability was carved out for discretionary acts, as long as they were not performed maliciously, wantonly or in an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">This court subsequently adopted the public duty doctrine, which provided even more immunity to public officials. <em>Leger v. Kelley, </em>142 Conn. 585, 589-90, 116 A.2d 429 (1955). Reaffirming the public duty doctrine in <em>Shore </em>v. <em>Stonington, </em>supra, 152, we said: \u201c \u2018[I]f the duty which the official authority imposes upon an officer is a duty to the public, a failure to perform it, or an inadequate or erroneous performance, must be a public and not an individual injury, and must be redressed if at all in some form of public prosecution. On the other hand, if the duty is a duty to the individual, then a neglect to perform it or to perform it properly, is an individual wrong, and may support an individual action for damages.\u2019 <em>Leger </em>v. <em>Kelley, </em>[supra]; see also <em>South </em>v. <em>Maryland, </em>59 U.S. (18 How.) 396, 402-403, 15 L. Ed. 433 (1855); <em>Massengill </em>v. <em>Yuma County, </em>104 Ariz. 518, 521, 456 P.2d 376 (1969); 2 Cooley, Torts (4th Ed.) \u00a7 300; 63 Am. Jur. 2d, Public Officers and Employees \u00a7 287; 65 C.J.S., Negligence \u00a7 4 (8); annot., 41 A.L.R.3d 700.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b184-6\">The court in <em>Shore </em>also went on to say: \u201cPolicy considerations have also resulted in the establishment of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>certain exceptions which provide that an individual cause of action may be brought against an official for breach of duty without regard to whether the duty is technically a public or private one.\u201d Id., 153. The <em>Shore </em>opinion outlined limited exceptions to the rule that officials who undertake discretionary actions are immune from civil liability. \u201c[Wjhere the duty of the public official to act is not ministerial but instead involves the exercise of discretion, the negligent failure to act will not subject the public official to liability unless the duty to act is clear and unequivocal.\u201d Id. One exception is when \u201cit would be apparent to the public officer that his failure to act would be likely to subject an identifiable person to imminent harm.\u201d Id.; see, e.g., <em>Sestito </em>v. <em>Groton, </em>supra, 528. Another exception is where \u201ca statute may specifically provide for a cause of action against an official or a municipality for failure to enforce certain laws, such as those designed to prevent disturbances of the peace by riotous assemblies. See, e.g., <em>Sestito </em>v. <em>Groton, </em>supra, 523-24 (General Statutes \u00a7 7-108).\u201d <em>Shore </em>v. <em>Stonington, </em>supra, 154. A third exception to the general rule is where the complaint alleges an action involving malice, wantonness or intent to injure, rather than negligence. Id., 155; see, e.g., <em>Stiebitz </em>v. <em>Mahoney, </em>144 Conn. 443, 448-49, 134 A.2d 71 (1957); <em>Medeiros </em>v. <em>Kondo, </em>55 Hawaii 499, 503, 522 P.2d 1269 (1974); 63 Am. Jur. 2d, Public Officers and Employees \u00a7 290.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-4\">This court has also discussed extensively the difference between a ministerial and a discretionary act. \u201cA municipality is immune from liability for the performance of governmental acts as distinguished from ministerial acts. Governmental acts are performed wholly for the direct benefit of the public and are supervisory or discretionary in nature. ... On the other hand, ministerial acts are performed in a prescribed manner without the exercise of judgment or discretion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>as to the propriety of the action.\u201d <em>Gauvin </em>v. <em>New Haven, </em>supra, 184; <em>Tango </em>v. <em>New Haven, </em>supra, 204-205; <em>Wright </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>167 Conn. 464, 471, 356 A.2d 176 (1975); see General Statutes \u00a7 52-557n.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The public/private duty distinction and the ministerial/discretionary test may appear to overlap and this has resulted in a lack of consistent analysis by this state\u2019s courts. Compare <em>Tango </em>v. <em>New Haven, </em>supra (ministerial/discretionary test), and <em>Fraser </em>v. <em>Henninger, </em>173 Conn. 52, 60, 376 A.2d 406 (1977) (ministerial/discretionary test), with <em>Trautman </em>v. <em>Stamford, </em>32 Conn. Sup. 258, 262, 350 A.2d 782 (1975) (public/private duty test); see note, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>\u201cThe Official Responsibility Rule and its Implications for Municipal Liability in Connecticut: <em>Shore </em>v. <em>Town of Stonington,\u201d </em>15 Conn. L. Rev. 641, 647 (1983). Whether a public or private duty is established, there is no potential liability if the act complained of is a discretionary act that does not fit into any of the narrow exceptions outlined in <em>Shore. </em>The finding of a public duty is often, but not always, dispositive of whether the act is a discretionary one. See, e.g., <em>Trautman </em>v. <em>Stamford, </em>supra, 263 (demurrer sustained upon reaching conclusion of patrolmen\u2019s duty to general public). In other cases, however, a breach of a public duty may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>still result in liability for the official if the act that he or she negligently performs is a ministerial act. See, e.g., <em>Wright </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>supra, 471-72 (failure to quarantine dog, although a violation of a duty to the public, was ministerial act and demurrer overruled). Thus, although the public duty doctrine provides the starting point of the analysis, distinctions between discretionary acts and ministerial acts are often controlling without regard to whether the duty is ascertained to be public or private. <em>Shore </em>v. <em>Stonington, </em>supra, 153.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">Under the framework in <em>Shore, </em>the court looks to see whether there is a public or private duty alleged by the plaintiff. If a public duty exists, an official can be liable only if the act complained of is a ministerial act or one of the narrow exceptions to discretionary acts applies. We must resolve whether the issue of a public duty can be decided on a motion to strike in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-6\">The purpose of a motion to strike is to \u201ccontest . . . the legal sufficiency of the allegations of any complaint ... to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.\u201d Practice Book \u00a7 152; <em>Mingachos </em>v. <em>CBS, Inc., </em>196 Conn. 91, 108, 491 A.2d 368 (1985). In ruling on a motion to strike, the court is limited to the facts alleged in the complaint. <em>King </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>195 Conn. 90, 93, 486 A.2d 1111 (1985). The court must construe the facts in the complaint most favorably to the plaintiff. <em>Amodio </em>v. <em>Cunningham, </em>182 Conn. 80, 82-83, 438 A.2d 6 (1980). Notwithstanding the procedural posture of a motion to strike, this court has approved the practice of deciding the issue of governmental immunity as a matter of law. See <em>Shore </em>v. <em>Stonington, </em>supra; <em>Wysocki </em>v. <em>Derby, </em>140 Conn. 173, 175, 98 A.2d 659 (1953); see also <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Branford, </em>12 Conn. App. 106, 110-11, 529 A.2d 743 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b188-7\">The plaintiff attempts to distinguish <em>Shore </em>by asserting that it was an appeal from a summary judgment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>based upon submitted evidence, and therefore the trial court sat as a factfinder in deciding a mixed question of law and fact. The plaintiffs distinctions are not persuasive and we conclude that the analysis in <em>Shore </em>controls this case. In <em>Shore, </em>we noted: \u201c \u2018Negligence is a breach of duty.\u2019 <em>Urban </em>v. <em>Hartford Gas Co., </em>139 Conn. 301, 304, 93 A.2d 292 (1952). It is important to distinguish between the existence of a duty and the violation of that duty. The plaintiff argues that summary judgment is inappropriate in this area because there existed a genuine dispute as to the material facts relating to the extent of [a police officer\u2019s] duty to the plaintiff\u2019s decedent. The law does not recognize a \u2018duty in the air.\u2019 See Pollock, Torts (13th Ed.) 468; Winfield, \u2018Duty in Tortious Negligence,\u2019 34 Colum. L. Rev. 41, 42 n.8 (1934). To sustain a cause of action, the court must determine whether the defendant owed a duty to the plaintiffs decedent; <em>Coburn </em>v. <em>Lenox Homes, Inc., </em>186 Conn. 370, 375, 441 A.2d 620 (1982); and the applicable standard of care. <em>Fidelity &amp; Casualty Co. </em>v. <em>Constitution National Bank, </em>167 Conn. 478, 482, 356 A.2d 117 (1975). The existence of a duty is a question of law. <em>Nolan </em>v. <em>The New York, New Haven &amp; Hartford Railroad Co., </em>53 Conn. 461, 471, 4 A. 106 (1885); Winfield, supra, 43. Only if such a duty is found to exist does the trier of fact then determine whether the defendant violated that duty in the particular situation at hand. See Green, \u2018The Duty Problem in Negligence Cases,\u2019 28 Colum. L. Rev. 1014, 1029-30 (1928).\u201d <em>Shore </em>v. <em>Stonington, </em>supra, 151-52.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">It is the existence of a duty that is the dispositive factor concerning the motion to strike in this case. To survive a motion to strike, the court must determine that the defendants owed a duty to the plaintiff\u2019s incapable. The existence of this duty is a matter for the court to decide, not a jury. Id. The plaintiff\u2019s claim that the trial court was precluded from deciding on a motion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>to strike whether the defendants owed a duty to the plaintiffs incapable is unavailing.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b190-6\">The plaintiff next asserts that the facts pleaded in her complaint, construed most favorably to her, would give rise to a violation of a ministerial duty by the defendants. As explained above, a ministerial duty is one imposed for acts performed without the exercise of discretion. <em>Gauvin </em>v. <em>New Haven, </em>supra. The third and fourth counts allege that the city failed to provide either adequate security or police protection to this housing project that the plaintiff claims was <em>owned </em>by the city. The trial court implicitly determined, as a matter of law, that the city did not own this housing project. Although the trial court did not specifically state that the city of Bridgeport was not the owner of the Marina Apartments housing project, it did determine that the city did not have responsibility to maintain the premises since the \u201cHousing Authority is an independent body corporate and politic [General Statutes \u00a7 8-40] and is not an agency of the city.\u201d It would be incongruous to believe that the trial court would factor into its decision concerning responsibility for maintenance of the housing project the issue of agency without having previously decided that the city itself did not own the project. Had the city owned the project, a discussion about agency by the trial court would have been unnecessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-7\">The trial court, in considering the statutory scheme in passing upon the allegations of the relevant counts, could determine, as a matter of law, that the BHA, which was a separate corporate entity from the city of Bridgeport, \u201cowned\u201d this project. The trial court could make this determination in construing the statutory scheme of part I of chapter 128 of the General Statutes. The interpretation of a statute is a question of law, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>not fact. <em>Robinson </em>v. <em>Unemployment Security Board of Review, </em>181 Conn. 1, 6, 434 A.2d 293 (1980). General Statutes \u00a7 8-40<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> provides: \u201cIn each municipality of the state there is created a public body corporate and politic to be known as the \u2018housing authority\u2019 of the municipality . . . .\u201d There can be no question under the allegations of the complaint that the BHA is \u201ca public body corporate and politic\u201d under the statute and, therefore, is a viable corporate entity capable of executing the powers conferred and subject to the liabilities directly attendant to its statutory being under the statutory scheme of part I of chapter 128 of the General Statutes. Among its powers, the BHA could \u201cown\u201d real property as it admittedly did. General Statutes \u00a7 8-44.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> It could also \u201coperate\u201d a housing project <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>as it did. General Statutes \u00a7 8-44. Even though the \u201cchief executive officer\u201d of the governing body of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>municipality (Bridgeport) \u201cappoints] . . . thecomissioners of the [housing] authority\u201d; General Statutes \u00a7 8-41;<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> it is the housing authority, not the municipal<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>ity, who \u201cshall protect and save harmless any commissioner . . . from financial loss and expense, including legal fees and costs, if any, arising out of any claim, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>demand, suit or judgment by reason of alleged negligence ... on the part of such commissioner . . . while acting in the discharge of his duties.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 8-41a.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> A housing \u201cauthority\u201d has the \u201cpower to issue bonds,\u201d and such \u201cbonds and other obligations of [a housing authority] shall not be obligations of the municipality.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 8-52.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> This is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>another of the indicia of its corporate independence. Because a \u201chousing authority\u201d is solely a creature of statute, allegations in an action seeking to make it liable in negligence must recognize its statutory limitations. We note, in addition, that the plaintiff admitted that the city of Bridgeport did not own this project in her answers to the defendants\u2019 requests for admission. This the trial court also could have considered on the matter of ownership. See <em>Chevette </em>v. <em>U-Haul Co. of New </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number><em>Mexico, </em>7 Conn. App. 617, 510 A.2d 206 (1986). Moreover, at oral argument, counsel indicated that the plaintiff had admitted that the city of Bridgeport did not own this project. In addition, the \u201cCooperation Agreement\u201d to which the plaintiff specifically refers in the allegations of the complaint speaks not only to that agreement, that \u201cshall continue in full force and effect with respect to [this] Project only so long as <em>title </em>thereto ... is held by the [Bridgeport Housing] Authority\u201d (emphasis added), but also to other indicia of ownership by the BHA such as the construction and maintenance of sidewalks, curbs and gutters within the project \u201cin the same manner as other private owners of property within the City,\u201d as well as speaking to the city\u2019s cooperation in \u201cvacating and discontinuing any streets and alleys . . . within the Project.\u201d The trial court could properly have considered such matters in ruling on the motion to strike. See <em>Utley </em>v. <em>Nolan, </em>134 Conn. 376, 377, 58 A.2d 9 (1948). In any event, the construction of a written contract is a question of law for the court. <em>Spring </em>v. <em>Nagle, </em>104 Conn. 23, 26-27, 131 A.744 (1926). Thus, the plaintiff\u2019s allegations concerning the defendant city\u2019s negligence as a landlord must fail.</p>\n<p id=\"AOE\">The plaintiff is left only with a claim that an alleged shortage of police patrols in the Marina Apartments housing project was a breach of a duty imposed by law and not simply a discretionary decision by the police department concerning deployment of its officers. The plaintiff\u2019s claims run counter to the great weight of authority that the operation of a police department is a discretionary governmental function. <em>Morris </em>v. <em>Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority, </em>781 F.2d 218, 220 (D.C. Cir. 1986); <em>Calogrides </em>v. <em>Mobile, </em>475 So. 2d 560, 561 (Ala. 1985); <em>Leibman </em>v. <em>Burbank, </em>490 So. 2d 218, 219 (Fla. 1986). <em>Motyka </em>v. <em>Amsterdam, </em>15 N.Y.2d 134, 138, 204 N.E.2d 635, 256 N.Y.S.2d 595 (1965); <em>Rion </em>v. <em>Ashland, </em>110 App. Div. 2d 944, 488 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>N.Y.S.2d 99 (1984). \u201c[I]t is firmly established that the operation of a police department is a governmental function, and that acts or omissions in connection therewith ordinarily do not give rise to liability on the part of the municipality. . . . [T]he failure to provide, or the inadequacy of, police protection usually does not give rise to a cause of action in tort against a city.\u201d 18 E. McQuillin, Municipal Corporations (3d Ed.) \u00a7 53.51. The deployment of officers is particularly a governmental function. \u201cConsiderable latitude must be allowed to [a police chief] in the deployment of his officers, or in enforcing discipline. Indeed, because a police chiefs authority to assign his officers to particular duties is deemed a matter that concerns the public safety, he may not be deprived of his power to \u2018exercise his own discretion and judgment as to the number, qualifications and identity of officers needed for particular situations at any given time\u2019 . . . .\u201d 16A E. McQuillin, supra, \u00a7 45.08. We conclude that the general deployment of police officers is a discretionary governmental action as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">At oral argument, the plaintiff asserted that Navarette belonged to a foreseeable class of plaintiffs within the exception for certain discretionary acts outlined in <em>Shore </em>v. <em>Stonington, </em>supra. The plaintiff, however, has not alleged any facts to support her claim. According to the complaint, the police had no knowledge whatsoever of the robbery of Navarette, who made no attempt to notify the police, and who entered the project on his own. The facts of this case do not support the claim that Navarette was even a remotely foreseeable plaintiff. Id.; <em>Sestito </em>v. <em>Groton, </em>supra. This is a weaker case factually than <em>Sestito </em>on this aspect.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-6\">The plaintiff has included a large list of cases in her brief that hold that whether an act is ministerial or discretionary is a question of fact and is not properly resolved on a motion to strike. The crucial distinguish<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>ing factor is that the duty of the municipality is unquestioned under the facts pleaded in those cases. See, e.g., <em>Gauvin </em>v. <em>New Haven, </em>supra (city had a duty to use due care in operating city park); <em>Tango </em>v. <em>New Haven, </em>supra, 205 (city had a duty to use due care in permitting the public to use city property for sled riding). In contrast, the city of Bridgeport and its employees had <em>no </em>duty, whether characterized as public or private, to provide police protection to the plaintiffs incapable under the facts alleged in the complaint. Had such a duty existed, then the plaintiff would have an opportunity to demonstrate that the defendants\u2019 actions in carrying out that duty were either ministerial or fell under an exception for discretionary acts. The well pleaded facts in this case do not reveal the existence of any duty owed to the plaintiff\u2019s incapable by the defendants. The cases cited by the plaintiff are inapposite. We conclude that the trial court did not err in deciding that the complaint did not sufficiently allege any violation of a ministerial act in carrying out the defendants\u2019 duty because the plaintiff failed to establish the existence of such a duty. The same conclusion must be made as to the failure of the allegations to fall under any exception for discretionary acts.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b199-6\">The plaintiff\u2019s next claim is that even if the city\u2019s duty is discretionary, the city created a duty to a foreseeable class of plaintiffs by undertaking certain obligations. Specifically, the plaintiff asserts that a cooperation agreement between the city and the BHA and the city\u2019s hiring of special police officers created a duty to a foreseeable class of plaintiffs of which the plaintiff\u2019s incapable was a member\u2014tenants of the housing project and their invitees.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-7\">Concerning the cooperation agreement, the plaintiff argues that signing the agreement was a discretion<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>ary act but carrying out that agreement was a ministerial act, leading to possible liability for negligent performance of that obligation. Although making a contract may bind a municipality to perform an obligation with due care, the dispositive factor is that this contract merely promised that the defendant city would provide the Marina Apartments housing project with the same police protection that it provided to the remainder of the city\u2019s residents. We have already established that the provision of police services to a city\u2019s general population is a quintessential discretionary governmental act. The defendant city provided what it had promised. A promise to provide discretionary police services does not turn the implementation of the provision of those services into ministerial acts.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">The plaintiff\u2019s claim that the hiring of six special police officers created a duty to a foreseeable class of plaintiffs is also untenable because we have already determined that the plaintiff has not alleged any facts to support her claim that Navarette belonged to a foreseeable class of plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-6\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b200-7\">The plaintiff also asks this court to abrogate the public duty doctrine. The doctrine, described above, was announced in <em>Leger </em>v. <em>Kelley, </em>supra, and reaffirmed in <em>Shore </em>v. <em>Stonington, </em>supra. We recognize that the public duty doctrine has been abrogated by a number of jurisdictions. See, e.g., <em>Adams </em>v. <em>State, </em>555 P.2d 235, 241-42 (Alaska 1976); <em>Ryan </em>v. <em>State, </em>134 Ariz. 308, 310, 656 P.2d 597 (1982); <em>Leake </em>v. <em>Cain, </em>720 P.2d 152, 158 (Colo. 1986); <em>Brennan </em>v. <em>Eugene, </em>285 Or. 401, 409, 591 P.2d 719 (1979); <em>Petersen </em>v. <em>State, </em>100 Wash. 2d 421, 432-33, 671 P.2d 230 (1983). As the defendants point out, however, a number of these jurisdictions had previously abolished governmental immunity and their courts held that a public/private duty distinction was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>merely a recreation of governmental immunity. See, e.g., <em>Adams </em>v. <em>State, </em>supra; <em>Brennan </em>v. <em>Eugene, </em>supra. In other jurisdictions, other doctrines remain in effect that limit liability for government officials. See, e.g., <em>Leake </em>v. <em>Cain, </em>supra (qualified immunity in effect); <em>Petersen </em>v. <em>State, </em>supra (traditional distinction between discretionary and ministerial acts remains); see also 18 E. McQuillin, supra, \u00a7 53.04b (\u201c[t]he states which have rejected the public duty rule have done so at least in part, on the basis that the rule is in reality nothing more than a continuation of the abolished governmental immunity doctrine\u201d). In contrast, Connecticut has not abolished governmental immunity. See General Statutes \u00a7 52-557n.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">It is also apparent that this plaintiff could not achieve a different outcome in this case even if the public duty doctrine was abrogated since the distinction between discretionary and ministerial acts would remain. See <em>Petersen </em>v. <em>State, </em>supra. The plaintiff clearly has not shown by any allegations in the challenged counts that any actions by the defendants were ministerial and has not established that any exception for discretionary acts applies. Therefore, even if the public duty doctrine were abolished, a finding that the defendants\u2019 actions were discretionary and not ministerial would preclude liability of the defendants. Although it is true that the distinction between public/private duties and discretionary/ministerial acts often overlap, the plaintiff\u2019s reasons for urging the abrogation of the public duty doctrine are unconvincing. As we said in <em>Rogan </em>v. <em>Board of Trustees, </em>178 Conn. 579, 582, 424 A.2d 274 (1979), \u201c \u2018[t]he question whether the principles of governmental immunity from suit and liability can best serve this and succeeding generations has become, by force of the long and firm establishment of these principles as precedent, a matter for legislative, not judicial, determination.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b202-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">The plaintiffs next claim is that the trial court erred in ruling as a matter of law that the city of Bridgeport did not stand in an agency relationship to the BHA. The plaintiff asserts that an agency relationship exists because the municipality has the power to create the authority under General Statutes \u00a7 8-40 and it has control over the BHA by the power to appoint and remove commissioners under General Statutes \u00a7 8-41. In the alternative, the plaintiff argues that an agency relationship existed for a particular purpose, i.e., police protection, because of the \u201cCooperation Agreement\u201d that existed and the claim that the city hired six police officers for all of the BHA\u2019s projects.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-6\">\u201cAgency is defined as \u2018 \u201cthe fiduciary relationship which results from manifestation of consent by one person to another that the other shall act on his behalf and subject to his control, and consent by the other so to act . . . .\u201d Restatement (Second), 1 Agency \u00a7 1.\u2019 <em>McLaughlin </em>v. <em>Chicken Delight, Inc., </em>164 Conn. 317, 322, 321 A.2d 456 (1973). Thus, the three elements required to show the existence of an agency relationship include: (1) a manifestation by the principal that the agent will act for him; (2) acceptance by the agent of the undertaking; and (3) an understanding between the parties that the principal will be in control of the undertaking. Restatement (Second), 1 Agency \u00a7 1, comment b (1958).\u201d <em>Botticello </em>v. <em>Stefanovicz, </em>177 Conn. 22, 25, 411 A.2d 16 (1979); <em>Beckenstein </em>v. <em>Potter &amp; Carrier, Inc., </em>191 Conn. 120, 132-33, 464 A.2d 6 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b202-7\">Although the finding of an agency relationship is ordinarily a question of fact; <em>Beckenstein </em>v. <em>Potter &amp; Carrier, Inc., </em>supra, 133; <em>Conte </em>v. <em>Dwan Lincoln-Mercury, Inc., </em>172 Conn. 112, 124, 374 A.2d 144 (1976); the plaintiff is asserting an agency relationship based <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>solely on the statutory scheme of part I of chapter 128 of the General Statutes. Therefore, unless the statutory scheme permits a finding of an agency relationship, there is no factual question to resolve. We conclude that part I of chapter 128 fails to permit a finding of an agency relationship. First, the city has no power to control the actions of the BHA. Under \u00a7 8-41, \u201c[t]he powers of each authority shall be vested in the commissioners thereof.\u201d See <em>Better Home Heat Council, Inc. </em>v. <em>Housing Authority, </em>148 Conn. 536, 538, 172 A.2d 610 (1961). It is true that the commissioners can be removed for cause by the city; General Statutes \u00a7 8-43;<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> but the city does not have the power to control the actions of the authority as it would were it a true principal of the BHA. See W. Seavey, Agency (1977) \u00a7 (E) 3 (\u201c[t]he right of the principal to direct what the agent shall do or shall not do is basic\u201d). Second, under the powers of the authority under General Statutes \u00a7 8-44, the authority is not granted the power legally to bind the city. This is another essential element of a bona fide agency relationship. <em>Botticello </em>v. <em>Stefanovicz, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">In the context of a taxpayer standing issue, this court said: \u201cThe housing authority is a distinct corporate entity. Cum. Sup. 1955, \u00a7 437d. It is not an agency of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>the city of Hartford.\u201d <em>Austin </em>v. <em>Housing Authority, </em>143 Conn. 338, 349, 122 A.2d 399 (1956). \u201cA municipal authority created under a municipal authorities statute has been regarded as a corporate agency of the state and not a creature, agent or representative of the municipality organizing it.\u201d 1 E. McQuillin, supra, \u00a7 2.29a. Concerning a housing authority, the Rhode Island Supreme Court noted: \u201cOnce created it becomes an autonomous body, subject only to the limits of power imposed by law. . . . [They] are not instruments of the government created for its own uses or subject to its direct control.\u201d <em>Housing Authority </em>v. <em>Fetzik, </em>110 R.I. 26, 33, 289 A.2d 658 (1972). Moreover, the cooperation agreement between the city and the BHA, states that the BHA is a separate corporate entity \u201corganized and existing under the laws of the State of Connecticut within the City of Bridgeport.\u201d We conclude as a matter of law that part I of chapter 128 of the General Statutes does not establish an agency relationship between the city of Bridgeport and the BHA.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">In the alternative, the plaintiff argues that an agency relationship existed for a particular purpose, i.e., providing police protection. The plaintiff points to two factors: the cooperation agreement between the two parties and the fact that the defendant city hired and placed six special police officers in the BHA\u2019s projects. This claim is not persuasive. In the cooperation agreement, the city agreed to furnish to the authority\u2019s housing project its \u201cnormal municipal services,\u201d including police protection. This \u201cnormal\u201d level of police protection is no different from that offered to all other city residents. The agreement did not specify patrol levels or any other details of the protection offered. Therefore the level of protection offered was within the discretionary authority of the city and its representatives. By the plaintiff\u2019s logic, the city would have an agency relationship with every resident of Bridgeport. This is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>untenable and we conclude that the cooperation agreement did not form the basis of an agency relationship between the city and the BHA. The plaintiff also points to the hiring of six police officers to patrol the BHA\u2019s projects to establish an agency relationship for a particular purpose. As explained earlier in this opinion, the plaintiff formerly and incorrectly believed that the city owned the Marina Apartments housing project. The six officers hired by the city \u201cmostly remained\u201d at Father Panik Village, another housing project that is separate and distinct from the Marina Apartments housing project. Contrary to the plaintiffs contentions, the city\u2019s actions in another housing project do not establish an agency relationship between the city and the BHA for any purpose in the project involved in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-6\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b181-6\"> General Statutes \u00a7 47a-7 (a) (2) and(3)provides: \u201clandlord\u2019s responsibilities.

A reasonable time before appointing any such commissioner, the appointing authority shall notify any such tenant organization and, in making such appointment, such authority shall consider tenants suggested by such tenant organizations.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b195-11\"> General Statutes \u00a7 8-41a provides: \u201cliability of authority for actions of commissioners and employees. Each housing authority shall protect and save harmless any commissioner or any full-time employee of such authority from financial loss and expense, including legal fees and costs, if any, arising out of any claim, demand, suit or judgment by reason of alleged negligence, or for alleged infringement of any person\u2019s civil rights, on the part of such commissioner or such employee while acting in the discharge of his duties.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b195-12\"> General Statutes \u00a7 8-52 provides: \u201cbonds. An authority shall have the power to issue bonds, from time to time, in its discretion, for any of its corporate purposes. An authority may issue such types of bonds as it determines, including, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, bonds on which the principal and interest are payable (a) exclusively from the income and revenues of the housing project financed with the proceeds of such bonds; (b) exclusively from the income and revenues of certain designated housing projects, whether or not they are financed in whole or in part with the proceeds of such bonds; or (c) from its revenues generally. Any such bonds may be additionally secured by a pledge of any grant or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>contributions from the federal government or other source, or a pledge of any income or revenues of the authority, or a mortgage of any housing project, projects or other property of the authority. Neither the commissioners of an authority nor any person executing the bonds shall be liable personally on the bonds by reason of the issuance thereof. The bonds and other obligations of an authority shall not be obligations of the municipality or of the state or any political subdivision thereof and such bonds shall so state on their face, and neither the municipality nor the state or any political subdivision thereof shall be liable thereon nor, in any event, shall such bonds or obligations be payable out of any funds or properties other than those of such authority. The bonds shall not constitute an indebtedness within the meaning of any debt limitation or restriction. Bonds of an authority shall be authorized by its resolution and may be issued in one or more series and shall bear such date or dates, mature at such time or times, bear interest at such rate or rates, be in such denomination or denominations, be in such form, either coupon or registered, carry such conversion or registration privileges, have such rank or priority, be sold and executed in such manner, be payable in such medium of payment and at such place or places and be subject to such terms of redemption, with or without premium, as such resolution, its trust indenture or its mortgage may provide. If any commissioner or officer of the authority whose signature appears on any bonds or coupons ceases to be such commissioner or officer before the delivery of such bonds, such signature shall, nevertheless, be valid and sufficient for all purposes, the same as if he had remained in office until such delivery. Any provision of any law to the contrary notwithstanding, any bonds issued pursuant to this chapter shall be fully negotiable. In any suit, action or proceedings involving the validity or enforceability of the provisions of any bonds of an authority or the security therefor, any such bond reciting in substance that it has been issued by the authority to aid in financing a housing project to provide dwelling accommodations for persons of low income shall be conclusively deemed to have been issued for a housing project of such character and such project shall be conclusively deemed to have been planned, located and constructed in accordance with the purposes and provisions of this chapter.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b203-6\"> General Statutes \u00a7 8-43 provides: \u201cremoval of commissioners; subpoenas. A commissioner of an authority may be removed by the appointing power for inefficiency, neglect of duty or misconduct in office, but a commissioner shall be removed only after opportunity to be heard in person or by counsel before the appointing power, at least ten days prior to which he shall have been given a copy of the charges against him. In the event of the removal of any commissioner, a record of the proceedings, together with the charges and findings thereon, shall be filed in the office of the clerk. Such appointing power, for its purposes under this section, may subpoena any books, papers, records, accounts, contracts, deeds, regulations or documents. Any person who wilfully refuses to produce such books, papers, records, accounts, contracts or documents shall be fined not more than five hundred dollars or imprisoned not more than six months or both.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
