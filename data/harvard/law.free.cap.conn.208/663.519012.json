On appeal, the hospital claims that the trial court erred in holding that (1) \u00a7 19a-160-53 of the Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies is consistent with \u00a7 19a-154 and, therefore, is valid; and (2) the commission\u2019s deficiency letter was issued within the time required under \u00a7 19a-160-53. We find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-6\">The trial court found the following facts. On May 21, 1986, the hospital mailed to the commission a letter requesting forms on which to submit a certificate of need application relating to open heart surgery. In response, the commission sent to the hospital a copy of the commission\u2019s \u201cCORE\u201d application form, which is the form to be used by all applicants for a certificate of need.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-7\">On July 14,1986, the hospital hand-delivered to the commission an application for a certificate of need for open heart surgery and coronary angioplasty programs. On July 15, 1986, the hospital mailed a letter with attachments to the commission concerning the hospital\u2019s application for a certificate of need. The attachments consisted of four corrected pages and twenty-six <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>additional pages, constituting the hospital\u2019s audited financial statements, which were to be added to the application. The July 15 letter and the accompanying material were received by the commission on July 23, 1986.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-4\">On August 6,1986, the commission, after reviewing the application, sent a five page letter to the hospital stating that on July 23, 1986, the commission had received the hospital\u2019s application and had found it deficient. The commission requested a significant amount of additional information. The hospital did not respond to the commission\u2019s letter.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-5\">In a letter to Commissioner Nancy Watters dated December 8, 1986, legal counsel for the hospital indicated that he had advised the hospital that it was authorized to proceed with open heart surgery because the commission had not denied or modified the hospital\u2019s application within ninety days of its hand-delivered submission. Counsel for the hospital stated that it was his opinion that the deficiency letter of August 6 was invalid, because it was sent more than ten days after the original application date of July 14, 1986, even though the deficiency letter referred to July 23,1986, as the triggering date.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-6\">On May 16,1987, the commission, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 19U-159,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> filed a petition for enforcement of the requirements of General Statutes \u00a7 19a-154,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>seeking to enjoin the hospital from instituting open heart surgery and coronary angioplasty programs without the prior approval of the commission. On November 9,1987, the trial court entered a permanent order <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>prohibiting the hospital from instituting open heart surgery and coronary angioplasty programs. This appeal followed.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b685-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b685-5\">The hospital claims that \u00a7 19a-160-53<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> of the Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies is inconsistent with General Statutes \u00a7 19a-154 and therefore is invalid. Section 19a-154 requires any health care facility or institution that intends to introduce any additional function or service into its program of health care to \u201crequest the permission\u201d of the commission prior to instituting any such function or service. Section \u00a7 19a-160-53 defines an application as \u201call the required components and any special components set forth in these regulations.\u201d The hospital contends that the phrase \u201crequest the permission\u201d does not allow for the interpretation taken by the commission in the regulations, namely, that such a \u201crequest\u201d means a completed application. See Regs., Conn. State Agencies \u00a7 19a-160-53 (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b685-6\">The commission was created by the legislature to ensure the efficient utilization of health care resources and to control the burgeoning costs of health care. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number><em>Griffin Hospital </em>v. <em>Commission on Hospitals &amp; Health Care, </em>200 Conn. 489, 497, 512 A.2d 199, appeal dismissed, 479 U.S. 1023, 107 S. Ct. 781, 93 L. Ed. 2d 819 (1986). To achieve those ends, the legislature granted the commission broad powers over the budgets of hospitals and over the initiation of new programs and capital expenditures by health care institutions. Id., 497-98; see General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 19a-150, 19a-151, 19a-153 (a), 19a-154 (a), 19a-156 (a). Further, the legislature has expressly directed the commission to adopt such regulations as will implement the commission\u2019s purposes; General Statutes \u00a7 19a-160; and the validly enacted regulations of an administrative agency carry the force of statutory law. <em>Griffin Hospital </em>v. <em>Commission on Hospitals &amp; Health Care, </em>supra, 497; <em>Salmon Brook Convalescent Home </em>v. <em>Commission on Hospitals &amp; Health Care, </em>177 Conn. 356, 363, 417 A.2d 358 (1979). A party attacking such a regulation has the burden of showing beyond a reasonable doubt that it is in conflict with the legislation. <em>Aaron </em>v. <em>Conservation Commission, </em>183 Conn. 532, 537, 441 A.2d 30 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b686-4\">The hospital claims that the legislature focused on the receipt of the request for permission, not on the accompanying information. We disagree. Section 19a-154 specifies a number of factors the commission must consider in determining whether to approve a request for a new function or service. These factors include \u201cthe availability of such service or function at other inpatient rehabilitation facilities . . . within the area to be served, the need for such service or function within such area,\u201d and other factors that the commission deems relevant to the decision. General Statutes \u00a7 19a-154. General Statutes \u00a7 19a-153 lists additional criteria that the commission must consider in its certificate of need determinations.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Obviously, the commission cannot <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>make an informed judgment regarding such proposals unless the commission has before it the information that pertains to the statutory factors. The enumeration of these factors, therefore, suggests that the legislature was concerned with the information to be submitted with a request and did not contemplate that the commission would act upon a bare \u201crequest for permission.\u201d Further, it is the well established practice of this court to accord great deference to the time-tested construction given a statute by the agency charged with its enforcement. <em>Texaco Refining &amp; Marketing Co. </em>v. <em>Commissioner, </em>202 Conn. 583, 599, 522 A.2d 771 (1987); <em>Griffin Hospital </em>v. <em>Commission on Hospitals &amp; Health Care, </em>supra, 496.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-4\">The commission\u2019s regulations are a reasonable construction of the statutory phrase \u201crequest for permission\u201d because they further the legislative intent of having the commission consider a multitude of factors before making its determinations.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Under \u00a7 19a-160-53 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>the commission must send a deficiency letter to the applicant notifying it that its request is not properly before the commission. The ninety day review period does not begin to run, therefore, because the application, lacking adequate accompanying information, has not enabled the commission to consider the statutory factors set forth in \u00a7\u00a7 19a-153 and 19a-154. Because the legislature is presumed to have acted rationally; <em>State </em>v. <em>Parmalee, </em>197 Conn. 158, 165, 496 A.2d 186 (1985); it would not have specified the factors to be considered by the commission and, at the same time, have prevented it from establishing procedures that would allow the commission to collect the information needed to evaluate those factors.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b688-4\">The hospital contends that the commission should be required to deny requests containing insufficient infor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>mation, rather than allow the staff to issue deficiency letters. The commission\u2019s procedure, however, provides a more efficient mechanism for processing requests, while the hospital\u2019s approach would delay the process. A deficiency letter notifies an applicant of a preliminary determination that the commission will not be able to make an informed decision based on the information provided. The application is no longer before the commission, but the commission retains the application and requires only that the applicant address the deficiencies, rather than resubmit an entirely new application. In this case, the hospital stated that its application was comprised of more than 130 pages of a completed questionnaire as well as many pages of supporting documents. The commission\u2019s regulations requiring that the hospital correct only the deficiencies set forth in the letter, therefore, saved this applicant the considerable time and expense involved in submitting an entirely new application.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-4\">The hospital claims that even though the commission must issue deficiency letters within ten days, the commission could needlessly prolong the application process through repeated requests for additional information. First, we note that the hospital has never questioned the appropriateness of the August 6 request for information. Second, \u00a7 19a-160-53 limits the commission to one deficiency letter. If the applicant complies with the specific requests for additional information, the commission cannot thereafter raise unrelated claims of deficiencies in an application. The commission may determine, however, that the applicant has failed to comply with the initial request for additional information, in which case the application remains \u201cno longer before the Commission.\u201d Regs., Conn. State Agencies \u00a7 19a-160-53. Although the hospital characterizes the deficiency letters as \u201cnot subject to appeal,\u201d the hospital would not have been without a remedy if it had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>wished to challenge the propriety of a request for further information. General Statutes \u00a7 4-176<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> provides that an agency may, in its discretion, issue declaratory rulings as to the applicability of any statutory provision or of any regulation or order of the agency. The challenge to a regulation, therefore, should begin with a petition to the agency itself. See <em>Connecticut Hospital Assn. </em>v. <em>Commission on Hospitals &amp; Health Care, </em>200 Conn. 133, 509 A.2d 1050 (1986); <em>Connecticut Assn. of Health Care Facilities, Inc. </em>v. <em>Worrell, </em>199 Conn. 609, 508 A.2d 743 (1986). An adverse ruling is appeal-able under General Statutes \u00a7 4-183; <em>Beck </em>v. <em>Board of Trustees, </em>32 Conn. Sup. 153, 155, 344 A.2d 273 (1975); and the failure of an agency to issue a ruling permits action under General Statutes \u00a7 4-175. <em>Connecticut Assn. of Boards of Education, Inc. </em>v. <em>Shedd, </em>197 Conn. 554, 560-61, 499 A.2d 797 (1985). In this case, therefore, the hospital could have filed with the commission a petition for a declaratory ruling pursuant to \u00a7 4-176, claiming that \u00a7 19a-160-53 was inapplicable to the hospital\u2019s situation, because the additional information requested by the staff was unnecessary for consideration of its application.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-4\">The hospital maintains that the commission\u2019s practice of having its staff issue deficiency letters amounts to an unauthorized delegation of decision-making power, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>and therefore, the commission itself should be required to make the decisions regarding the completeness of an application. We agree with the hospital that the decisions of the staff are not decisions of the commission but, as stated above, health care facilities have adequate remedies for contesting staff decisions in \u00a7\u00a7 4-175 and 4-176.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b691-4\">We have consistently held that administrative agencies may exercise wide discretion in the performance of their duties. <em>Patry </em>v. <em>Board of Trustees, </em>190 Conn. 460, 478, 461 A.2d 443 (1983); <em>Riley </em>v. <em>State Employees\u2019 Retirement Commission, </em>178 Conn. 438, 442, 423 A.2d 87 (1979). Further, in addressing the practical realities of the administrative process, we have recognized that \u201c[cjompetent subordinates may sift and analyze evidence, recommend findings of fact and conclusions of law, and draft orders for an administrative agency as an integral part of the process.\u201d <em>Connecticut Natural Gas Corporation </em>v. <em>PUCA, </em>183 Conn. 128, 138, 439 A.2d 282 (1981). \u201cSound principles of organization demand that those at the top be able to concentrate their attention upon the larger and more important questions of policy and practice, and that their time be freed, so far as possible, from the consideration of the smaller and less important matters of detail.\u201d Hearing on H.R. 4732, before House Comm, on Interstate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>and Foreign Commerce, 72d Cong., 2d Sess. 7 (1933); see also <em>Fleming </em>v. <em>Mohawk Wrecking &amp; Lumber Co., </em>331 U.S. 111, 120-21, 67 S. Ct. 1129, 91 L. Ed. 1375 (1947); <em>Morgan </em>v. <em>United States, </em>298 U.S. 468, 481, 56 S. Ct. 906, 80 L. Ed. 1288 (1936). We conclude that the commission\u2019s regulations provide an efficient method for reviewing the adequacy of the voluminous financial, medical and scientific information that ordinarily accompanies a certificate of need application.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b692-5\">The hospital claims that even if the commission could lawfully adopt \u00a7 19a-160-53, the commission\u2019s August 6 deficiency letter was not issued within the time required under \u00a7 19a-160-53. Section \u00a7 19a-160-53 requires that all deficiencies in an application be brought to the attention of the applicant not later than ten days after receipt of the application. The hospital maintains that the ten day period should run from July 14, 1986, the date of its first submission of a certificate of need application, and not July 23, 1986, the date on which the commission received the hospital\u2019s supplemental filing that had been mailed on July 15, 1986. This claim essentially challenges the trial court\u2019s factual finding that the submission received on July 23, 1986, was a new application.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-6\">Because it is not the function of this court to retry facts; <em>Coelho </em>v. <em>Posi-Seal International, Inc., </em>208 Conn. 106, 124-25, 544 A.2d 170 (1988); the scope of our review is limited to determining whether the trial court\u2019s factual findings were clearly erroneous. <em>McGaffin </em>v. <em>Roberts, </em>193 Conn. 393, 409, 479 A.2d 176 (1984), cert. denied, 470 U.S. 1050, 105 S. Ct. 1747, 84 L. Ed. 2d 813 (1985). The hospital states that the July 23 submission \u201cwas not a new application, or an application in any sense of the word.\u201d Rather, it was simply the submission of additional and corrected infor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>mation that became part of the application already on file. The trial court, however, found that the hospital had failed to submit the facility\u2019s audited financial statements in its original submission of July 14, 1986: \u201cIt was not until July 23, 1986 that these <em>required </em>components were submitted in the attempt by the Hospital to file a complete application.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) The trial court stated that these additions substantially modified and supplemented the hospital\u2019s July 14 application. \u201c \u2018We will not reverse the decision of the trial court unless it is clearly erroneous in light of the evidence and the pleadings in the record as a whole. <em>Damora </em>v. <em>Christ-Janer, </em>184 Conn. 109, 113, 441 A.2d 61 (1981).\u2019\u201d <em>Mallory </em>v. <em>Mallory, </em>207 Conn. 48, 55, 539 A.2d 995 (1988). We conclude that the trial court\u2019s determination that the July 23 submission was a new application was not clearly erroneous in view of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-5\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-6\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b683-7\"> \u201c[General Statutes] See. 19a-159.

We emphasized that requests for jury instructions must be more than bare requests. Id., 558-59. We conclude that General Statutes \u00a7 19a-154 does not preclude the commission from reaching the similar conclusion that the statutory phrase, \u201crequest for permission,\u201d means more than a bare request.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b688-11\"> The hospital cites <em>Finn </em>v. <em>Planning </em>&amp; <em>Zoning Commission, </em>156 Conn. 540, 244 A.2d 391 (1968), for the proposition that the ninety day review period under General Statutes \u00a7 19a-154 necessarily begins on receipt of a \u201crequest for permission,\u201d even if the request lacks supporting information. <em>Finn </em>is readily distinguishable. <em>Finn </em>involved the failure of the agency to pass on a subdivision proposal. In the case at hand, there was no inaction by the commission. Rather, it was quite obvious that the hospital had been informed that its application was incomplete.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-12\">The hospital claims also that the 1987 amendment to \u00a7 19a-154 supports its position that \u00a7 19a-160-53 of the Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies is inconsistent with \u00a7 19a-154. In 1987, the legislature amended \u00a7 19a-154 to provide that the commission may extend the review period for up to thirty days if the applicant has not filed in a timely manner information deemed necessary by the commission. See Public Acts 1987, No. 87-192. This amendment was not effective at any time when the hospital\u2019s application was pending before the commission, and therefore, does not affect this case.

Each agency may, in its discretion, issue declaratory rulings as to the applicability of any statutory provision or of any regulation or order of the agency, and each agency shall provide by regulation for the filing and prompt disposition of petitions seeking such rulings. If the agency issues an adverse ruling, the remedy for an aggrieved person shall be an action for declaratory judgment under section 4-175 unless the agency conducted a hearing pursuant to sections 4-177 and 4-178 for the purpose of finding facts as a basis for such ruling, in which case the remedy for an aggrieved person shall be an appeal pursuant to section 4-183. If the agency fails to exercise its discretion to issue such a ruling, such failure shall be deemed a sufficient request by the plaintiff for the purposes of section 4-175. Rulings disposing of petitions have the same status as agency decisions or orders in contested cases.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b691-5\"> General Statutes \u00a7 19a-158 provides that health care facilities aggrieved by a decision of the commission may appeal in accordance with General Statutes \u00a7 4-183. Because a deficiency letter sent pursuant to \u00a7 19a-160-53 of the Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies does not constitute a decision by the commission, however, an applicant may not challenge the propriety of a deficiency letter through the procedure set forth in \u00a7 19a-158. Cf. <em>Griffin Hospital v. Commission on Hospitals &amp; Health Care, </em>196 Conn. 451, 493 A.2d 229 (1985) (appeal pursuant to \u00a7 19a-158 from commission\u2019s rejection of hospital\u2019s budget proposal); <em>Hospital of St. Raphael </em>v. <em>Commission on Hospitals &amp; Health Care, </em>182 Conn. 314, 438 A.2d 103 (1980) (appeal pursuant to \u00a7 19a-158 from commission\u2019s denial of request to purchase and operate CT scanner). General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 4-175 and 4-176 provide the remedy for challenging a deficiency letter.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
