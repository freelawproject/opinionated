We find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-10\">This products liability action was commenced in March, 1986, and assigned to the trial court under the \u201cindividual calendar\u201d program. The plaintiffs are Scott Jaconski and his wife, Catherine Jaconski, who were injured while riding a motorcycle manufactured and sold by the defendants, AMF, Inc. (AMF), Harley-Davidson Motor Co., Inc. (Harley Motor), and Harley-Davidson Sales Corporation (Harley Sales). On appeal, the plaintiffs claim that the trial court erred (1) in entering a nonsuit on its own motion, and (2) in denying their motion to set aside the nonsuit on the ground that the plaintiffs\u2019 negligence precluded such relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-11\">On November 12,1986, AMF and Harley Motor filed a request to revise the plaintiffs\u2019 complaint. On November 21,1986, these defendants served interrogatories and requests for production upon the plaintiffs. At a pretrial discovery conference on May 12, 1987, the court ordered counsel for the plaintiffs to file a revised complaint within one week of May 12,1987, and further <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>ordered the plaintiffs to respond to the interrogatories by June 15,1987. These orders were followed by a written pretrial order to the same effect on May 14,1987.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-6\">On June 19, 1987, AMF and Harley Motor filed a motion for nonsuit because the plaintiffs had failed to file a revised complaint and had failed to respond to AMF\u2019s interrogatories of November 21,1986, as ordered by the court. On June 22,1987, the plaintiffs filed objections to AMF\u2019s and Harley Motor\u2019s request to revise filed November 12, 1986.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-7\">AMF\u2019s and Harley Motor\u2019s request to revise and the plaintiffs\u2019 objections to the request to revise appeared on the short calendar on July 27, 1987. At that hearing, the trial court determined that the court\u2019s order to the plaintiffs to revise their complaint within one week had not been complied with and the court on its own motion nonsuited the plaintiffs pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 351 for failure to comply with an order of the court. No motion for nonsuit was on the short calendar list for hearing that day.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-8\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b250-9\">The plaintiffs claim that the trial court misconstrued its authority under Practice Book \u00a7 351 when it entered a nonsuit against the plaintiffs, on its own motion, for their failure to comply with an order of the court. Their argument is twofold: first, the trial court is not authorized to enter a nonsuit under Practice Book \u00a7 351 on its own motion, and second, they had no notice that the trial court would nonsuit them.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-10\">Practice Book \u00a7 351 provides that \u201c[i]f a party fails to comply with an order of court or a citation to appear or fails without proper excuse to appear for trial, he may be nonsuited or defaulted by the court.\u201d Section 351 thus plainly authorizes the trial court to enter a nonsuit for noncompliance with its orders. Further, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>trial court has the inherent power to provide for the imposition of reasonable sanctions, to compel the observance of its rules. <em>Gionfrido </em>v. <em>Wharf Realty, Inc., </em>193 Conn. 28, 33, 474 A.2d 787 (1984); <em>Stanley </em>v. <em>Hartford, </em>140 Conn. 643, 648, 103 A.2d 147 (1954). As we noted in <em>Gionfrido, </em>the trial court has the responsibility to process cases in a timely and efficient manner. \u201c \u2018In order to fulfill our responsibility of dispensing justice we in the judiciary must adopt an effective system of caseflow management. Caseflow management is based upon the premise that it is the responsibility of the court to establish standards for the processing of cases and also, when necessary, to enforce compliance with such standards. Our judicial system cannot be controlled by the litigants and cases cannot be allowed to drift aimlessly through the system. . . \u201d <em>Gionfrido </em>v. <em>Wharf Realty, Inc., </em>supra, 32-33, quoting <em>In re Mongillo, </em>190 Conn. 686, 690-91, 461 A.2d 1387 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b251-7\">The plaintiffs suggest that because no motion for non-suit was on the short calendar for July 27, 1987, they had no notice that the trial court would nonsuit them. We disagree. On May 12, 1987, at the pretrial discovery conference, the trial court directed the plaintiffs\u2019 counsel to file a specified document by a specified date. Under these circumstances, the order itself in conjunction with \u00a7 351 constituted sufficient notice that failure to comply could result in a nonsuit. On May 14, 1987, the trial court issued a written order that embodied the order of May 12, and on June 19, 1987, AMF and Harley Motor filed a motion for nonsuit because the plaintiffs had failed to comply with the May 12 order of the court.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> These facts indicate that the plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>tiffs were more than amply apprised of the potential consequences of failing to comply with the court\u2019s May 12 order.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-6\">The plaintiffs contend also that a \u201cprior notice\u201d requirement, such as that found in Practice Book \u00a7 251 (\u201cDismissal for Lack of Diligence\u201d),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> should be engrafted onto Practice Book \u00a7 351.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> As noted above, however, the May 12 order itself constituted notice to the plaintiffs that they could be nonsuited for failure to comply with the court\u2019s order. Further, the facts of the instant case are readily distinguishable from a \u00a7 251 situation. Under \u00a7 251, the trial court is confronted with endless gradations of diligence, and in its sound discretion, the court must determine whether the party\u2019s diligence falls within the \u201creasonable\u201d section of the diligence spectrum. See, e.g., <em>Gionfrido </em>v. <em>Wharf Realty, Inc., </em>supra. The two week notice requirement, where applicable, allows a party to offer an explanation for his delay, or to cure the deficiency that is the basis for the proposed dismissal. Under \u00a7 351, on the other hand, an order of the court has already been entered, and whether the order is justified because of a lack of diligence is no longer arguable. An order of the court must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>be obeyed until it has been modified or successfully challenged. See <em>Fox </em>v. <em>First Bank, </em>198 Conn. 34, 40 n.3, 501 A.2d 747 (1985). When an order has been entered, a party is not faced with the uncertainty of forecasting whether his conception of \u201creasonable diligence\u201d conforms with the trial court\u2019s view. A party is presumed to be aware of the rules of practice and thus to know that disobedience of a court order may result in a nonsuit under \u00a7 351. When the plaintiffs in this case, therefore, failed to file a revised complaint as ordered, they must be presumed to have had notice that their failure to do so could result in a nonsuit. The trial court was within its discretion in nonsuiting the plaintiffs for failure to file the revised complaint.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b253-7\">The plaintiffs filed a motion to set aside the non-suit on August 7, 1987, within the four month period allowed by General Statutes \u00a7 52-212.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The plaintiffs\u2019 counsel attached to the motion an affidavit in which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>he sought to establish that the plaintiffs were prevented by mistake, accident or other reasonable cause from complying with the court\u2019s order. On September 29, 1987, the court issued a memorandum of decision denying the plaintiffs\u2019 motion to set aside the nonsuit. In its memorandum of decision, the trial court found that the plaintiffs\u2019 failure to comply with the court\u2019s order was due to their negligence, and not to mistake, accident or other reasonable cause. The trial court held that because the plaintiffs had failed to make a showing of mistake, accident or other reasonable cause, as required by \u00a7 52-212, the court had no discretion to set aside the nonsuit.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b255-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>The plaintiffs claim that a finding of negligence by the trial court does not necessarily preclude the court from setting aside a nonsuit. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-6\">The power of a court to set aside a nonsuit judgment is controlled by \u00a7 52-212. <em>Pantlin &amp; Chananie Development Corporation </em>v. <em>Hartford Cement &amp; Bldg. Supply Co., </em>196 Conn. 233, 234-35, 492 A.2d 159 (1985); <em>Eastern Elevator Co. </em>v. <em>Scalzi, </em>193 Conn. 128, 131, 474 A.2d 456 (1984); <em>Jaquith </em>v. <em>Revson, </em>159 Conn. 427, 431, 270 A.2d 559 (1970). The statute provides that any judgment rendered upon a nonsuit may be set aside upon the complaint or written motion of any party or person prejudiced thereby, showing reasonable cause, or that a good cause of action in whole or in part existed at the time of the rendition of the judgment and that the plaintiff was prevented by mistake, accident or other reasonable cause from prosecuting the action. It is thus clear that there is a two-pronged test for setting aside a judgment rendered after a nonsuit. <em>Eastern Elevator Co. </em>v. <em>Scalzi, </em>supra. There must be a showing (1) that a good cause of action, the nature of which must be set forth, existed at the time judgment was rendered, and (2) that the plaintiff was prevented from prosecuting the action because of mistake, accident or other reasonable cause. General Statutes \u00a7 52-212; Practice Book \u00a7 377; <em>Pantlin &amp; Chananie Development Corporation </em>v. <em>Hartford Cement &amp; Bldg. Supply Co., </em>supra, 235.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-7\"><em>In Eastern Elevator Co. </em>v. <em>Scalzi, </em>supra, 131-32, we reiterated that in granting or denying a motion to open a judgment, the trial court is required to exercise a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>sound judicial discretion and its decision will be set aside only for an abuse of such discretion. We noted in <em>Jaquith </em>v. <em>Revson, </em>supra, that the denial of a motion to set aside a nonsuit should not be held to be an abuse of discretion in any case in which it appears that a plaintiff has not been prevented from prosecuting the claim by mistake, accident or other reasonable cause. Further, we have long held that negligence is no ground for vacating a judgment, and that the denial of a motion to open a nonsuit judgment should not be held an abuse of discretion where the failure to prosecute the claim was the result of negligence. <em>People\u2019s Bank </em>v. <em>Horesco, </em>205 Conn. 319, 323-24, 533 A.2d 850 (1987); <em>Jaquith </em>v. <em>Revson, </em>supra, 432; <em>Automotive Twins, Inc. </em>v. <em>Klein, </em>138 Conn. 28, 34, 82 A.2d 146 (1951).</p>\n<p id=\"b256-6\">The trial court made the specific finding that the failure of the plaintiffs to file the revised complaint was due to their negligence, and not to any accident, mistake or other reasonable cause. This finding was well within the trial court\u2019s discretion. See <em>People\u2019s Bank </em>v. <em>Horesco, </em>supra, 324. Because the finding signified that the plaintiffs had not fulfilled the statutory prerequisites for setting aside a nonsuit, the trial court correctly concluded that it had no authority to set aside the nonsuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-7\">The plaintiffs claim that a proper reading of <em>Trichilo </em>v. <em>Trichilo, </em>190 Conn. 774, 462 A.2d 1048 (1983), demonstrates that a court may set aside a nonsuit, despite a finding of negligence by that court. In <em>Trichilo, </em>the trial court rendered a judgment of default against the defendant for failure to appear and awarded damages to the plaintiff; the trial court later denied a motion to open the judgment. In affirming the trial court, we stated: \u201cAlthough a reasonable degree of liberality should be exercised in determining whether a default has resulted from <em>excusable neglect, </em>the transcript indicates no abuse of discretion by the trial court in that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>respect . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) Id., 783. This statement does not support the plaintiffs\u2019 contention that a court may set aside a nonsuit, despite a finding of negligence. Rather, <em>Trichilo </em>reflects the legislative determination embodied in General Statutes \u00a7 52-212 that not all deviations from ideal performance constitute negligence, and that a limited class of deviations may be excusable because they were the result of \u201cmistake, accident or other reasonable cause.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 52-212. In those cases, the trial court may exercise its discretion and set aside a judgment of nonsuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-4\">The trial court was within its discretion in finding negligence on the plaintiffs\u2019 part. Having determined that the plaintiffs failed to meet the statutory requirements of \u00a7 52-212, the trial court correctly concluded that it had no authority to set aside the judgment of nonsuit against the plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-6\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b251-8\"> We note that the trial court need not have issued the May 14 written order for the plaintiffs to have had sufficient notice of the possibility of a nonsuit: the oral order at the May 12 pretrial conference was enough. We mention the May 14 written order and the June 19 motion for nonsuit to emphasize that there could have been little doubt by the plaintiffs as to what was expected of them, as well as to the possible consequences if they failed to comply.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b252-7\"> \u201c[Practice Book] Sec. 251. dismissal for lack of diligence</p>\n<p id=\"b252-8\">\u201cIf a party shall fail to prosecute an action with reasonable diligence, the court may, after hearing, on motion by any party to the action pursuant to Sec. 196, or on its own motion, render a judgment dismissing the action with costs.
