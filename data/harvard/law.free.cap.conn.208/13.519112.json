W. Beardsley, Inc. On June 27,1986, the plaintiff directed an ex parte application for the prejudgment remedy of replevin to a judge of the Superior Court for the judicial district of Hartford-New Britain at Hartford. Thereafter, on July 10,1986, the court issued an order authorizing the replevin of certain property. The action was made returnable to the judicial district of New Haven on August 19, 1986.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-8\">On December 15,1986, the parties appeared before the court in the judicial district of New Haven on the defendant\u2019s motion to dissolve the prejudgment remedy. The defendant contended, inter alia, that the ex parte prejudgment application was improper as it was made to a judge of the Superior Court for the judicial district of Hartford-New Britain at Hartford, rather than to the judicial district of New Haven, in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 52-278c (a) (l).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The plaintiff con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>tended that pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 52-278e* <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> it was unnecessary to direct the ex parte application to the court to which the action was returnable. The court, after accepting an offer of proof from the plaintiff, vacated the plaintiffs prejudgment remedy of replevin on the ground that the plaintiff had failed to comply with \u00a7 52-278c (a) (1) by failing to direct its ex parte application for prejudgment remedy to the court to which the action was returnable.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-5\">The plaintiff thereafter took this appeal contending that the trial court erred in: (1) vacating the plaintiffs prejudgment remedy on the ground that an ex parte application for a prejudgment remedy must be presented to the court wherein the action is returnable; (2) vacating the plaintiffs prejudgment remedy without allowing the plaintiff an opportunity to prove prob<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>able cause at the hearing on the defendant\u2019s motion to dissolve the prejudgment remedy; and (3) failing to grant the plaintiff\u2019s motion to stay the court\u2019s order of December 15,1986, vacating the plaintiff\u2019s prejudgment remedy of replevin.* *<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> As we find that the court erred in vacating the plaintiff\u2019s prejudgment remedy on the Basis that the ex parte application had to be directed to the court to which the action was returnable, it is unnecessary to address the remaining issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-5\">General Statutes \u00a7 52-278a et seq. was \u201cenacted in response to the constitutional instructions of <em>Fuentes </em>v. <em>Shevin, </em>407 U.S. 67, 92 S. Ct. 1983, 32 L. Ed. 2d 556 (1972), and <em>Sniadach </em>v. <em>Family Finance Corporation, </em>395 U.S. 337, 89 S. Ct. 1820, 23 L. Ed. 2d 349 (1969), [and under that statute,] prejudgment remedies were no longer to be automatically issued by attorneys as commissioners of the Superior Court. Instead, such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>remedies were to be granted only by a court and, except under the exceptional circumstances specified by the statute, only after a hearing conducted in accordance with the requirements of due process.\u201d <em>Sellner </em>v. <em>Beechwood Construction Co., </em>176 Conn. 432, 434, 407 A.2d 1026 (1979). In order to comply with due process, notice and an opportunity to be heard must be afforded litigants \u201c \u2018at a meaningful time and in a meaningful manner.\u2019\u201d <em>Fermont Division </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>178 Conn. 393, 397, 423 A.2d 80 (1979). In accordance with \u00a7 52-278e, a prejudgment remedy may issue without notice to the defendant or without a hearing, upon verification to the court by oath of the plaintiff or some competent affiant, that there is probable cause to sustain the validity of the plaintiff\u2019s claim. <em>Glanz </em>v. <em>Testa, </em>200 Conn. 406, 408-409, 511 A.2d 341 (1986). In order to comply with federal due process requirements, \u00a7 52-278e guarantees a defendant the opportunity for an immediate postseizure hearing at which time the court will dissolve the prejudgment remedy unless it determines that probable cause exists to sustain the plaintiff\u2019s claim. Id., 409; <em>Fermont Division </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>supra, 397-98.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-5\">The remedy of allowing a plaintiff to secure a defendant\u2019s property in order to satisfy a potential judgment in favor of the plaintiff is a creature of statute. <em>Glanz </em>v. <em>Testa, </em>supra, 408; <em>Essex Group, Inc. </em>v. <em>Ducci Electric Co., </em>181 Conn. 524, 525, 436 A.2d 16 (1980); <em>Ledgebrook Condominium Assn., Inc. </em>v. <em>Lusk Corporation, </em>172 Conn. 577, 582, 376 A.2d 60 (1977). No party may obtain a prejudgment remedy in any action unless the party seeking the prejudgment remedy has complied with the statutory mandates. <em>Essex Group, Inc. </em>v. <em>Ducci Electric Co., </em>supra; <em>Ledgebrook Condominium Assn., Inc. </em>v. <em>Lusk Corporation, </em>supra, 583. The defendant contends that the plaintiff, by directing its ex parte application for the prejudgment remedy to a court other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>than the one to which the action was returnable, circumvented the mandatory statutory procedures delineated in the prejudgment remedy statute. The plaintiff claims that no such procedure is required by the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-5\">\u201cA statute does not become ambiguous solely because the parties disagree as to its meaning.\u201d <em>Commissioner </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>204 Conn. 609, 620, 529 A.2d 692 (1987); <em>Luttrell </em>v. <em>Luttrell, </em>184 Conn. 307, 310-11, 439 A.2d 981 (1981); <em>Harris Data Communications, Inc. </em>v. <em>Heffernan, </em>183 Conn. 194, 198, 438 A.2d 1178 (1981). A statute is to be read as a whole; <em>Clinton Nurseries, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue Services, </em>205 Conn. 761, 766, 535 A.2d 361 (1988); <em>Struckman </em>v. <em>Burns, </em>205 Conn. 542, 546, 534 A.2d 888 (1987); <em>American Universal Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>DelGreco, </em>205 Conn. 178, 193, 530 A.2d 171 (1987); <em>University of Connecticut Chapter, AAUP </em>v. <em>Governor, </em>200 Conn. 386, 399, 512 A.2d 152 (1986); <em>Orticelli </em>v. <em>Powers, </em>197 Conn. 9, 14, 495 A.2d 1023 (1985); \u201cwith a view toward reconciling its separate parts in order to render a reasonable overall interpretation.\u201d <em>American Universal Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>DelGreco, </em>supra; <em>University of Connecticut Chapter, AAUP </em>v. <em>Governor, </em>supra; <em>Orticelli </em>v. <em>Powers, </em>supra. \u201c \u2018If the words of a statute are clear, the duty of a reviewing court is to apply the legislature\u2019s directive, since, where the wording is plain, courts will not speculate as to any supposed intention. The question before a court then is not what the legislature actually intended, but what intention it expressed by the words that it used. . . .\u2019 \u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Kyrtatas </em>v. <em>Stop &amp; Shop, Inc., </em>205 Conn. 694, 699, 535 A.2d 357 (1988); <em>Struckman </em>v. <em>Burns, </em>supra, 545-46.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-8\">The defendant argues that the \u201cinclusive\u201d language of General Statutes \u00a7 52-278b<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> providing that \u201cno <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>prejudgment remedy shall be available to a person in any action at law or equity unless he has complied with the provisions of sections 52-278a to 52-278g, inclusive\u201d dictates that \u00a7 52-278e must be read in conjunction with \u00a7 52-278c (a) (1), and that the provisions of \u00a7 52-278c (a) (1) for \u201c[a]n application, directed to the superior court to which the action is made returnable, for the prejudgment remedy requested\u201d must therefore be followed when a party is seeking an ex parte prejudgment remedy. Such an interpretation is untenable. An interpretation of a statute that would have it function in a \u201cdifficult and possibly bizarre\u201d fashion must be avoided. <em>Texaco Refining &amp; Marketing Co. </em>v. <em>Commissioner, </em>202 Conn. 583, 593, 522 A.2d 771 (1987); <em>Peck </em>v. <em>Jacquemin, </em>196 Conn. 53, 72, 491 A.2d 1043 (1985). Section 52-278c governs those situations in which a hearing is scheduled to determine whether the requested prejudgment remedy should be granted. The statute begins with the words \u201c[ejxcept as provided in \u00a7\u00a7 52-278e and 52-278\u00cd, any person desiring to secure a prejudgment remedy shall [follow delineated procedures].\u201d Section 52-278e governs prejudgment remedies sought without a hearing. This statute states in relevant part that \u201c[t]he court or a judge of the court may allow the prejudgment remedy to be issued by an attorney without hearing as provided in sections 52-278c and 52-278d\u201d in certain delineated circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-5\">The defendant, in suggesting an inclusive interpretation of \u00a7 52-278b, propounds an illogical reading of the statute in view of the fact that procedures for ex parte proceedings and proceedings that are not ex parte <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>are Separately stated. Clearly, not every section of chapter 903a of the General Statutes comes into operation whenever a party seeks a prejudgment remedy. \u201c \u2018In construing a statute, common sense must be used, and courts will assume that the legislature intended to accomplish a reasonable and rational result.\u2019 \u201d <em>King </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>203 Conn. 324, 332-33, 524 A.2d 1131 (1987); <em>Gentry </em>v. <em>Norwalk, </em>196 Conn. 596, 606, 494 A.2d 1206 (1985). \u201c \u2018Statutes must be construed, if possible, that absurdity and mischief may be avoided.\u2019 \u201d <em>King </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>supra, 333.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-5\">The defendant suggests that allowing a party to seek an ex parte application for a prejudgment remedy from a court other than that to which the action is returnable may promote judge shopping or forum selection. The defendant appears to overlook the procedural safeguards available to defendants who wish to contest the granting of an ex parte prejudgment remedy. Section 52-278e \u201cguarantees the defendant the opportunity for an immediate post-seizure hearing at which the prejudgment remedy will be dissolved unless the court determines \u2018that there is probable cause to sustain the validity of the plaintiffs claim.\u2019 \u201d <em>Glanz </em>v. <em>Testa, </em>supra, 409. That hearing would be held in the judicial district to which the action is returnable.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-6\">A court may allow an ex parte prejudgment remedy to be issued by an attorney only in those exceptional circumstances delineated in the statute.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> This statutory scheme reflects an intent by the legislature to protect the interest of a party which might otherwise be jeopardized, while affording a defendant adequate procedural safeguards. To suggest that parties be required to travel to distant courts in the face of some of the exigent circumstances to obtain an ex parte order, is to defy the intent of the legislature as evidenced by the language of the statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>There is error, the judgment is set aside and the case is remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-6\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b32-9\"> \u201c[General Statutes] Sec. 52-278c. documents required, forms, hearing.
