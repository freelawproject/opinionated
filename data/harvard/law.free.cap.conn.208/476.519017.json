Examination of the record discloses that on December 30,1985, the board rendered three decisions concerning the plaintiffs proposal to erect a chapel/mausoleum on land located within an RA-2 residential zone. The board denied: (1) the plaintiffs appeal from a decision of the building inspector who had refused to issue a building permit for the proposed structure; (2) a proposed variance of the use requirements in an RA-2 zone to permit the proposed structure; and (3) a special exception request to permit a cemetery on the plaintiffs premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-9\">On January 10,1986, the plaintiff appealed all three decisions to the Superior Court pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 8-8.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The trial court upheld the board\u2019s deci<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>sion in each instance and on October 7,1987, rendered judgment dismissing the appeal. The Appellate Court thereafter granted a petition for certification and the plaintiff appealed. This court then transferred the matter to itself pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4023.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-4\">\u201cThe threshold question that must be determined is whether this court has jurisdiction over the appeal. Although this issue was not raised by the parties, the court has a duty to dismiss, even on its own initiative, any appeal that it lacks jurisdiction to hear. <em>L. G.
