The trial court rendered judgment for the plaintiff enjoining the defendant from using its property as a trucking terminal. The defendant appealed to the Appellate Court claiming, inter alia, that the ordinance delegating to the commission the authority to approve or disapprove site plans was an impermissible delegation of a zoning function. The Appellate Court held that this claim was not properly before the court because the defendant had not been aggrieved by the ordinance it challenged, as the defendant had not sought to obtain site plan approval under the Norwich zoning ordinances.</p>\n<p id=\"b21-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>We granted certification limited to the issue as to whether, in an action by a city to enjoin certain activities of a landowner as violative of a zoning ordinance, the defendant landowner may attack the validity of the ordinance without first having attempted to secure such administrative relief as may be available under the ordinance. The plaintiff filed a preliminary statement of alternate grounds of affirmance, which presents the additional issue of whether, assuming that the defendant can challenge in this action the delegation of site plan review authority to the commission, that delegation was proper and constitutional under the city charter.</p>\n<p id=\"b21-6\">The underlying facts are fully set forth in <em>Norwich </em>v. <em>Norwalk Wilbert Vault Co., </em>11 Conn. App. 332, 527 A.2d 716 (1987). The defendant operated a concrete manufacturing business on its property in Norwich, which was a conforming use in an area which was classified as a heavy industrial zone. In 1982, the defendant began renting space to various trucking companies that used the property as a trucking terminal. The heavy industrial zone permits trucking terminals. Under \u00a7 10.2.2 of the Norwich zoning ordinances, \u201c[a]ll uses permitted in [the heavy industrial zone] shall be subject to site plan approval by the commission in accordance with the provisions of Chapter 17, hereof.\u201d Chapter 17 of the Norwich zoning ordinances provides criteria for a site plan approval, and sets forth specific factors to be considered when a heavy industrial zone borders a residential zone. The trial court found that the use of the defendant\u2019s property as a trucking terminal was an increased use of the property, and therefore, that site plan approval was needed. Because the defendant had not sought site plan approval prior to engaging in the increased use of the property, the trial court issued an injunction enjoining the defendant from using the premises as a trucking terminal. The Appellate Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>upheld the decision of the trial court on the ground that the defendant had not exhausted the available administrative remedies and therefore did not reach the issue of delegation of authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b22-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b22-7\">The Appellate Court held that the defendant\u2019s claim, that the ordinance delegating the authority to the commission to approve or disapprove site plans was an impermissible delegation of a zoning function, was not properly before the court. The court reasoned that \u201c[t]he defendant in this case has not been aggrieved by the ordinance it challenges. . . . Until the commission on the city plan functions as contemplated by the ordinances, it cannot possibly be said that the defendant has been denied due process by that ordinance. . . . If the defendant applies for and is denied site plan approval under the ordinance, it may then challenge, in a declaratory judgment action, the constitutionality of the ordinance.\u201d <em>Norwich </em>v. <em>Norwalk Wilbert Vault Co., </em>supra, 337-38. We disagree with the holding of the Appellate Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b22-8\">It is well settled that a jurisdictional prerequisite to seeking relief in a court of law is that all available administrative remedies must have been exhausted. <em>Concerned Citizens of Sterling </em>v. <em>Sterling, </em>204 Conn 551, 556, 529 A.2d 666 (1987); <em>Cummings </em>v. <em>Tripp, </em>204 Conn. 67, 75, 527 A.2d 1230 (1987); <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Heintz, </em>204 Conn. 17, 34, 526 A.2d 1318 (1987). We have held, however, that under limited circumstances, there are exceptions to this principle. One such exception is that where the available relief is inadequate or futile, the administrative process may be bypassed. <em>Greenwich </em>v. <em>Liquor Control Commission, </em>191 Conn. 528, 541, 469 A.2d 382 (1983); <em>Sullivan </em>v. <em>State, </em>189 Conn. 550, 553-54, 457 A.2d 304 (1983); <em>Kosinski </em>v. <em>Lawlor, </em>177 Conn. 420, 425, 418 A.2d 66 (1979); <em>Bianco </em>v. <em>Darien, </em>157 Conn. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>548, 554-55, 254 A.2d 898 (1969). In <em>LaCroix </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>199 Conn. 70, 79 n.7, 505 A.2d 1233 (1986), we noted that \u201c[e]xhaustion of administrative remedies is generally not required when the challenge is to the constitutionality of the statute or regulation under which the board or agency operates, rather than to the actions of the board or agency. <em>Conto </em>v. <em>Zoning Commission, </em>186 Conn. 106, 115, 439 A.2d 441 (1982); <em>General Dynamics Corporation </em>v. <em>Groton, </em>184 Conn. 483, 490, 440 A.2d 185 (1981); <em>Friedson </em>v. <em>Westport, </em>181 Conn. 230, 233, 435 A.2d 17 (1980).\u201d Generally, such challenges have been instituted by a plaintiff in a declaratory judgment action. <em>Bierman </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>185 Conn. 135, 440 A.2d 882 (1981); <em>Bencivenga </em>v. <em>Milford, </em>183 Conn. 168, 438 A.2d 1174 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b23-6\">Today we apply this exception to the exhaustion principle to a case in which a defendant challenges the constitutional validity of a municipal ordinance in an action to enforce its provisions against him. This exception has gained acceptance by a number of state courts that have specifically considered this issue. The seminal case is <em>Lake </em>v. <em>MacNeal, </em>24 Ill. 2d 253, 181 N.E.2d 85 (1962), where the court held that the exhaustion principle does not apply to an action brought by a local government to enforce its own ordinances. The court stated that \u201cthere is . . . the sound principle, based upon the assumption that one may not be held civilly or criminally liable for violating an invalid ordinance, that a proceeding for the violation of a municipal regulation is subject to <em>any defense which will exonerate the defendant from liability, including a defense of the invalidity of the ordinance.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Id., 260. The rule is that \u201c[s]o long as local authorities institute an action, a defendant should be entitled to defend on the ground of the invalidity of the ordinance and to have the issue determined.\u201d Id. The court also stated: \u201c[W]e <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>believe there are substantial differences between a property owner who is the moving party in an action to declare an ordinance invalid as to his property, and one who is summoned into court and charged with illegally violating the ordinance . . . in the latter instance the very act of filing a complaint reflects a judgment on the part of the local authority that . . . they see no particular hardship and no necessity to correct the zoning regulation.\u201d Id. Thus, the <em>MacNeal </em>court based its holding on the premise that appealing the validity of an ordinance to the body charged with enforcing the ordinance is a futile act.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b24-6\">Moreover, the <em>MacNeal </em>rule has been adopted in many jurisdictions that have addressed the issue. See <em>Board of Commissioners </em>v. <em>Goldenrod Corporation, </em>43 Colo. App. 221, 601 P.2d 360 (1979); <em>Freeborn </em>v. <em>Claussen, </em>295 Minn. 96, 203 N.W.2d 323 (1972); <em>Londonderry </em>v. <em>Faucher, </em>112 N.H. 454, 299 A.2d 581 (1972); <em>New Paltz </em>v. <em>Pencil Hill Properties Corporation, </em>60 App. Div. 2d 738, 400 N.Y.S.2d 908 (1977); <em>Johnson\u2019s Island, Inc. </em>v. <em>Board of Township Trustees, </em>69 Ohio St. 2d 241, 431 N.E.2d 672 (1982); <em>Yakima County Clean Air Authority </em>v. <em>Glascam Builders, Inc., </em>85 Wash. 2d 255, 534 P.2d 33 (1975). We agree with the defendant\u2019s contention that where a party contests the very validity of a zoning ordinance, relief under the ordinance would be inadequate or futile. Under Connecticut law, local administrative bodies lack the competency to adjudicate the facial validity of an ordinance. See <em>Bencivenga </em>v. <em>Milford, </em>supra. This situation is distinguishable from a case where a landowner challenges the validity of an ordinance as applied. See <em>Florentine </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>v. <em>Darien, </em>142 Conn. 415, 115 A.2d 328 (1955). We are persuaded that in this instance, where the plaintiff city has haled the defendant into court, the defendant may defend on the ground of the general invalidity of the ordinance, without exhausting all available administrative remedies.</p>\n<p id=\"b25-6\">The plaintiffs argument, relying on <em>Bierman </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>supra, that the defendant should have brought a declaratory judgment action to challenge the validity of the zoning ordinance does not take into consideration the different procedural framework of a challenge made by a defendant rather than a plaintiff. In <em>Bierman, </em>we stated that \u201c[t]he rule extant under our zoning cases is that a party who has sought to avail himself of a zoning ordinance by making an application thereunder is precluded in the same proceeding from raising the question of its constitutionality. ... A party, however, could of course attack the constitutionality of the zoning regulations in an independent proceeding.\u201d Id., 139-40. In <em>Bierman, </em>a <em>plaintiff </em>was seeking redress under a zoning ordinance that it contended was invalid. The important policy we enunciated was that a declaratory judgment action would be the proper procedure for resolving the validity of the ordinance in order to ensure that all affected landowners would be provided with an opportunity to become involved in the proceedings. It is incongruous, however, to say that when property rights are at stake, in an action instigated by the municipality, a <em>defendant </em>may not challenge the validity of an ordinance in the proceeding that implicates his or her property rights. A defendant who does not abide by a zoning ordinance may be subject to fines, injunctions, penalties and imprisonment. See General Statutes \u00a7 8-12; Norwich Zoning Ordinances \u00a7 18.4. Thus, an appeal at a later date may not provide appropriate relief. We adhere to the principle that an invalid ordinance should <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>not be enforced. <em>Ruttenberg </em>v. <em>Dine, </em>137 Conn. 17, 19, 74 A.2d 211 (1950).</p>\n<p id=\"b26-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b26-7\">Having determined that the defendant was entitled to defend upon the ground of the unconstitutionally of the ordinance without having exhausted all available administrative remedies, we must examine the validity of the ordinance itself. The plaintiff claims that the judgment of the Appellate Court should be upheld on the alternate ground that the Norwich city council\u2019s delegation of authority to the commission to review and approve site plans did not deprive the defendant of due process of law under the United States and Connecticut constitutions. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-8\">The city of Norwich exercises its zoning power by virtue of a special act. Spec. Acts 1951, No. 573. This act established the Norwich city charter, which is the source of authority for the zoning ordinance that the defendant has challenged. <em>O\u2019Meara </em>v. <em>Norwich, </em>167 Conn. 579, 581, 356 A.2d 906 (1975). The defendant claims that the ordinance, by delegating the authority to approve site plans to the commission, is unconstitutional because the charter does not specifically confer such power upon the commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-9\">In our recent decision in <em>Cilley </em>v. <em>Lamphere, </em>206 Conn. 6, 535 A.2d 1305 (1988), we examined the Norwich city charter and noted these basic principles of law. \u201c \u2018 \u201cIt is well established that a city\u2019s charter is the fountainhead of municipal powers. . . <em>.\u2019\u2019\u2019Lombardi </em>v. <em>Bridgeport, </em>194 Conn. 601, 604, 483 A.2d 1092 (1984). \u2018The charter serves as an enabling act, both creating power and prescribing the form in which it must be exercised.\u2019 <em>West Hartford Taxpayers Assn., Inc. </em>v. <em>Streeter, </em>190 Conn. 736, 742, 462 A.2d 379 (1983). Agents of a city, including commissions, have no source of authority beyond the charter. <em>Perretta </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number><em>New Britain, </em>185 Conn. 88, 92, 440 A.2d 823 (1981). When a charter is construed, the rules of statutory construction generally apply. <em>Arminio </em>v. <em>Butler, </em>183 Conn. 211, 217, 440 A.2d 757 (1981). Common sense must be used in construing a statute. <em>Murach </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>196 Conn. 192, 196, 491 A.2d 1058 (1985).\u201d <em>Cilley </em>v. <em>Lamphere, </em>supra, 12. We also note that \u201c[t]he ordinance must rest primarily upon the enabling act and must not go beyond the power delegated by it.\u201d <em>Bishop </em>v. <em>Board of Zoning Appeals, </em>133 Conn. 614, 619, 53 A.2d 659 (1947).</p>\n<p id=\"b27-6\">Our examination of the Norwich city charter indicates that it confers broad power upon the city council to enact ordinances governing land use. Chapter 15, \u00a7 6, of the charter vests the city council with the power to regulate land use.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Chapter 5, \u00a7 8, of the charter provides in pertinent part that \u201cevery act [of the city council] . . . placing any burden upon or limiting the use <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>of private property, shall be by ordinance.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Chapter 15, \u00a7\u00a7 6 and 13, of the charter provide for the manner in which land use ordinances are enforced.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Finally, chapter 17 of the Norwich zoning ordinances establishes the substantive criteria governing the review and approval of site plans and provides for their enforcement through the commission on the city plan.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Thus, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>the charter has conferred power to regulate land use on the city council, and this authority must be exercised by ordinance. By ordinance, the city council estab<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>lished the criteria required for site plan approval. By ordinance, the city council also established the commission on the city plan as the body to examine the criteria and apply them to the individual applications.* *****<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In reviewing and approving site plans the commission acts in an administrative capacity. <em>Goldberg </em>v. <em>Zoning Commission, </em>173 Conn. 23, 29, 376 A.2d 385 (1977). Fur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>thermore, in reviewing site plans the commission has \u201cno independent discretion beyond determining whether the plan complies with the applicable regulations . . . [and] is under a mandate to apply the requirements of the regulations as written.\u201d <em>Allied Plywood, Inc. </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>2 Conn. App. 506, 512, 480 A.2d 584, cert. denied, 194 Conn. 808, 483 A.2d 612 (1984); <em>Kosinski </em>v. <em>Lawlor, </em>supra, 427. This delegation of power is consistent with the city council\u2019s power to provide, by ordinance, for the manner in which land use ordinances are enforced. We find that the delegation was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-5\">Therefore, we affirm the decision of the Appellate Court on the basis of the plaintiff\u2019s alternate grounds for affirmance.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-6\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b20-9\"> The city of Norwich was joined by the intervening plaintiffs, two couples who own residences on Vergason Avenue, Norwich.

We are not persuaded that the defendant\u2019s argument sets forth any statutory or constitutional authority restricting the city council from delegating site plan approval to the commission on the city plan. The broad powers granted to the city council to govern land use encompasses the powers of enforcement and delegation.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
