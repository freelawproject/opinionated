Ellice, individually and as executrix of the estate of her deceased husband, Douglas V. Ellice, instituted this action seeking to recover the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>proceeds of an accident insurance policy issued by the defendant, the INA Life Insurance Company of New York, to the plaintiffs decedent\u2019s employer, Shear-son/American Express, Inc. The policy covered those persons listed on a schedule of insureds that included the plaintiff\u2019s decedent. Specifically, the policy insured against loss \u201cresulting directly and independently of all other causes from bodily injuries caused by accident occurring while this policy is in force as to such Insured.\u201d The plaintiff alleged that the death of her decedent resulted from head injuries he sustained when he accidentally fell, after being startled, while ascending a stairway in his home at approximately 4 a.m. on October 20, 1982.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The defendant, however, claimed that the death of the plaintiffs decedent resulted from an arrhythmia<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> which caused his heart to stop, which then caused him to fall down the stairs. The defendant contended that the arrhythmia was brought about by the plaintiff\u2019s decedent\u2019s poor physical condition and preexisting heart disease.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>A jury returned a verdict for the defendant and the court, thereafter, rendered judgment thereon. The plaintiff filed the instant appeal to the Appellate Court which appeal was then transferred to this court pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4023. On appeal the plaintiff argues that the trial court erred in: (1) granting the defendant\u2019s oral motion in limine, to exclude from evidence the date and manner in which the plaintiffs decedent had fractured his left arm prior to the October 20, 1982 incident; and (2) failing to instruct the jury clearly and consistently with regard to the defendant\u2019s liability under the policy in question.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b238-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b238-7\">The plaintiff first claims that the court erred in granting the defendant\u2019s oral motion in limine, which ruling excluded certain evidence concerning the plaintiff\u2019s decedent\u2019s preexisting broken arm. She argues that the date and the details of the cause of the fractured left arm that were excluded were relevant to the following issues: (1) \u201cthe producing cause of a painful arm which rendered the plaintiff\u2019s [decedent\u2019s] ability to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>maintain balance and to withstand surprise in the middle of the night in his attempt to ascend the darkened stairway\u201d; (2) \u201cthe defendant\u2019s negating the causal relationship between the broken arm and any cause which would defeat recovery under the charge given\u201d; (3) \u201c[w]hy the plaintiff\u2019s decedent was up at four o\u2019clock in the morning and what medication he has been taking during those days\u201d; and (4) \u201c[t]he same relevance that any prior condition would have as to this case.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The plaintiff further argues that the exclusion of this evidence was prejudicial in that it raised suspicions in the jury\u2019s mind because references to the date and cause of the broken left arm were excised from the plaintiff\u2019s decedent\u2019s hospital records. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">The following facts are relevant to this issue. On October 15, 1982, the plaintiff and her decedent were carrying a wheelchair down the basement stairs in their home. As they descended the stairway, the wheelchair slipped from the plaintiff\u2019s hands and knocked the decedent to the cement floor of the basement. As a result, the plaintiff\u2019s decedent fractured his left arm, which was later placed in a sling.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b239-7\">After the jury had been selected, the defendant orally moved in limine to exclude from evidence the date and cause of the plaintiff\u2019s decedent\u2019s fractured left arm. The defendant argued that such evidence was totally irrelevant because the plaintiff\u2019s complaint limited the cause of the injuries and loss to the October 20, 1982 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>incident. In addition, the defendant asserted that such evidence had no probative value and was, in fact, prejudicial because it would confuse and mislead the jury, cause the jury to give attention to an accident that was not connected to the incident in question, and was not alleged to have caused the plaintiff\u2019s decedent\u2019s loss or injuries. After oral arguments by both counsel, the trial court granted the defendant\u2019s motion in limine and ordered that related portions of the hospital records be excised. We find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b240-7\">\u201cThe rules for determining the admissibility of evidence are well settled. The trial court has broad discretion to determine both the relevancy and remoteness of evidence. <em>State </em>v. <em>Fritz, </em>204 Conn. 156, 167, 527 A.2d 1157 (1987); <em>State </em>v. <em>Boucino, </em>199 Conn. 207, 225, 506 A.2d 125 (1986); <em>Turgeon </em>v. <em>Turgeon, </em>190 Conn. 269, 273, 460 A.2d 1260 (1983); <em>Hughes </em>v. <em>Contemporary Mission, Inc., </em>180 Conn. 150, 153, 429 A.2d 827 (1980). Only upon a showing of a clear abuse of discretion will this court set aside on appeal rulings on evidentiary matters. <em>State </em>v. <em>Fritz, </em>supra, 167-68; <em>State </em>v. <em>Boucino, </em>supra; <em>State </em>v. <em>Falcon, </em>196 Conn. 557, 566, 494 A.2d 1190 (1985). In considering the relevancy of evidence, we ask whether \u2018it tends to establish the existence of a material fact or to corroborate other direct evidence in the case. <em>State </em>v. <em>Sharpe, </em>[195 Conn. 651, 659, 491 A.2d 345 (1985)]; <em>State </em>v. <em>Mastropetre, </em>175 Conn. 512, 517, 400 A.2d 276 (1978).\u2019 <em>State </em>v. <em>Talton, </em>197 Conn. 280, 285, 497 A.2d 35 (1985). Because there is no precise and universal test of relevancy, however, the question must ultimately be addressed on a case-by-case basis in accordance with \u2018 \u201cthe teachings of reason and judicial experience.\u201d\u2019 <em>State </em>v. <em>Sharpe, </em>supra, 659; <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Healy, </em>183 Conn. 514, 516, 440 A.2d 765 (1981); <em>Hoadley </em>v. <em>University of Hartford, </em>176 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>Conn. 669, 672, 410 A.2d 472 (1979).\u201d <em>Dunham </em>v. <em>Dunham, </em>204 Conn. 303, 324, 528 A.2d 1123 (1987); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Thomas, </em>205 Conn. 279, 283, 533 A.2d 553 (1987). Applying these principles to the case at hand we conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in granting the defendant\u2019s motion in limine.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-6\">At the outset, we note that the trial court\u2019s ruling was very limited in scope and only prevented the plaintiff from introducing evidence to indicate that the plaintiffs decedent had fractured his left arm on October 15, 1982, while carrying a wheelchair down the basement stairs in his home. The court placed no limitation upon the plaintiff with regard to presenting evidence concerning any effect the decedent\u2019s broken arm might have had on his fall on October 20. The court also allowed the plaintiff to testify that the fracture was a \u201cfresh\u201d injury and that it resulted from a previous fall. The only way in which the trial court restricted the plaintiff was that it did not allow testimony with regard to the details of the prior unrelated accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-7\">We find the trial court\u2019s ruling appropriate: first, because the complaint specifically alleged that the injuries to the plaintiff\u2019s decedent had resulted from the \u201caccident on the 20th day of October, 1982,\u201d and the plaintiff never sought to amend the complaint to broaden the cause of the injuries to include a prior incident or accident; and second, because the plaintiff offered no evidence to permit even a remote inference to be drawn that the two stairway incidents were in any way causally related. In fact, the uncontroverted evidence establishes otherwise. The plaintiff\u2019s decedent fell on October 15,1982, because the wheelchair, which had slipped out of the plaintiff\u2019s hands, had knocked him down the cellar stairs to the concrete floor. The October 20, 1982 incident, however, according to the claims of the parties, resulted either from the plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>tiff\u2019s decedent being startled or from a heart attack.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> We can discern no connection between the two incidents, nor has any been pointed out. Thus, we fail to see the relevancy of the date, the cause or other details of the October 15 accident to the incident in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-6\">Notwithstanding the plaintiff\u2019s claims to the contrary, the trial court did not restrict the plaintiff\u2019s ability to demonstrate: the plaintiff\u2019s decedent\u2019s physical and emotional condition prior to October 20,1982; the fact that he had a broken arm and that he had been taking a pain medication and a sleeping medication; and the effects that these factors may have had on his ability to maintain his balance and to ascend stairs. The trial court did not err by excluding other irrelevant evidence concerning the October 15, 1982 accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-7\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b242-8\">The plaintiff also claims that she was prejudiced by the trial court\u2019s ruling on the defendant\u2019s motion in limine by reason of the trial court\u2019s order that excised the corresponding portions of the Yale-New Haven Hospital records relating to her decedent\u2019s broken arm. The plaintiff argues that the excised portions raised suspicions in the jury\u2019s mind because it was left in the dark about a \u201cterribly mysterious event .... They said, \u2018Oh, boy, what happened there.\u2019 They might have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>said that maybe the plaintiff didn\u2019t have sufficient proof to show what happened there.\u201d We find this argument without merit. We have already concluded that the manner in which the plaintiff\u2019s decedent fractured his left arm on October 15, 1982, had absolutely no relevance to the October 20, 1982 incident. In addition, a review of the Yale-New Haven Hospital records reveals that there were only five pages, out of approximately ninety pages, where either a word or single sentence was excised. Therefore, we are unable to discern any way in which the excised portions of the Yale-New Haven Hospital records could have adversely affected the jury or its deliberations to the prejudice of the plaintiff. The trial court did not err in ordering the references to the October 15,1982 accident of the plaintiff\u2019s decedent to be excised.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">The plaintiff next claims that the trial court erred by giving a confusing, misleading, erroneous and inconsistent charge to the jury regarding an insurer\u2019s liability under a policy insuring against loss resulting \u201cdirectly and independently of all other causes from bodily injuries caused by accident.\u201d Specifically, the plaintiff claims that it was error to charge the jury that \u201cthe plaintiff must prove to you that there were no other causes contributing to [her decedent\u2019s] death, irrespective of whether those causes were natural, were diseases, or were other conditions not a result of the alleged accident on October twentieth.\u201d In addition, the plaintiff argues that it was error to charge that \u201cthe death must be caused directly or solely by accidental means independently of all other causes in which case the accident must be the sole cause of the insured\u2019s event. Where disease or bodily infirmity is a concurrent proximate cause of death, recovery for the plaintiff is precluded.\u201d The plaintiff contends that \u201c[a] charge that the plaintiff could recover if she proved the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>accident was a \u2018dominant\u2019 cause of death would have been correct.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">We begin by noting that a jury charge is to be considered from the standpoint of its effect on the jury in guiding them to a correct verdict. <em>State </em>v. <em>Fleming, </em>198 Conn. 255, 268-69, 502 A.2d 886, cert. denied, 475 U.S. 1143, 106 S. Ct. 1797, 90 L. Ed. 2d 342 (1986); <em>State </em>v. <em>Reid, </em>193 Conn. 646, 660, 480 A.2d 463 (1984). \u201cA jury charge must be correct in law, adapted to the issues and sufficient for the guidance of the jury. <em>State </em>v. <em>Cooper, </em>182 Conn. 207, 211, 438 A.2d 418 (1980).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Hinckley, </em>198 Conn. 77, 88, 502 A.2d 388 (1985); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Vessichio, </em>197 Conn. 644, 650, 500 A.2d 1311 (1985), cert. denied, 475 U.S. 1122, 106 S. Ct. 1642, 90 L. Ed. 2d 187 (1986). A charge is not to be critically dissected for purposes of discovering possible inaccuracies; <em>State </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>198 Conn. 680, 686, 504 A.2d 1372 (1986); <em>State </em>v. <em>Reddick, </em>197 Conn. 115, 132, 496 A.2d 466 (1985), cert. denied, 474 U.S. 1067, 106 S. Ct. 822, 88 L. Ed. 2d 795 (1986); but rather, the initial charge and any supplemental charge are to be read as a whole. <em>State </em>v. <em>Cavros, </em>196 Conn. 519, 528, 494 A.2d 550, cert. denied, 474 U.S. 904, 106 S. Ct. 233, 88 L. Ed. 2d 232 (1985); <em>State </em>v. <em>Topciu, </em>183 Conn. 1, 6, 483 A.2d 803 (1981). \u201c \u2018 \u201cThe ultimate test of a court\u2019s instructions is whether, taken as a whole, they fairly and adequately present the case to a jury in such a way that injustice is not done to either party under the established rules of law.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-7\">Primarily, the plaintiff takes issue with the trial court\u2019s charge as it relates to the following policy language: \u201cdirectly and independently of all other causes from bodily injuries caused by accident.\u201d In the past, this court has had occasion to interpret virtually the identical clause in a number of accidental death or bodily injury policies. In each instance, we have required <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>the claimant under the policy to prove, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the insured was the victim of an accident and that the accident was the sole cause or sole proximate cause of the insured\u2019s death or bodily injury, independently of all other causes. Where preexisting bodily disease or infirmity, independent of the accidental injury, concurred, cooperated or contributed to produce the resulting injury, death or loss, we have held that no liability exists under such policy language. See <em>O\u2019Brien </em>v. <em>John Hancock Mutual Life Ins. Co., </em>143 Conn. 25, 28, 119 A.2d 329 (1955); <em>O\u2019Meara </em>v. <em>Columbian National Life Ins. Co., </em>119 Conn. 641, 644, 178 A. 357 (1935); <em>Rinaldi </em>v. <em>Prudential Ins. Co., </em>118 Conn. 419, 424, 172 A. 777 (1934); <em>Stanton </em>v. <em>Travelers Ins. Co., </em>83 Conn. 708, 710, 713, 78 A. 317 (1910).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> This court has also recognized, however, that the mere presence of a preexisting illness or disease does not, in and of itself, automatically preclude a recovery under the type of policy in question. <em>Rinaldi </em>v. <em>Prudential Ins. Co., </em>supra, 425; <em>Stanton </em>v. <em>Travelers Ins. Co., </em>supra; see also 43 Am. Jur. 2d 672-73, Insurance \u00a7 609.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-6\">After a careful review of the'trial court\u2019s instructions to the jury, we find that the court properly charged in accordance with the above stated principles of law. In explaining the pertinent policy provisions the court clearly stated numerous times that the plaintiff must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>prove, by a preponderance of the evidence, that her decedent died directly from an injury sustained in an accident on October 20, 1982, and that there were no other causes contributing to his death. The court explained that, unlike ordinary accidental death and or injury policies that do not contain the pertinent limiting language, the accident in this case must be the sole cause of the insured\u2019s loss and not merely the dominant cause or a concurrent proximate cause. To illustrate this point, the court stated: \u201cThe plaintiff should recover, however, if you find that the death directly resulted from accidental bodily injury notwithstanding the fact that a disease or disorder or preexisting condition existed if such disease, disorder or preexisting condition did not contribute to the death. In other words, if you believe from the evidence that Mr. Ellice died as a result of anything other than just an accident on October 20,1982, then the insurance company has no responsibility under the policy and your verdict should be for the defendant. On the other hand, if you find that the plaintiff has proved to you that Mr. Ellice died from an accident on October twentieth and that the death resulted directly and independently of all other causes from bodily injuries caused by the accident, you would then find for the plaintiff.\u201d In addition, the court repeated the specific policy language numerous times, thus clearly directing the jury\u2019s attention to the proper inquiry. Accordingly, we conclude that the court\u2019s charge, as a whole, was correct as a matter of law and provided sufficient guidance for the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-4\">The plaintiff has also argued that the court\u2019s use of the terms \u201cconcurrent proximate cause\u201d and \u201ccontributing cause\u201d was erroneous because it interjected irrelevant issues into the case. The plaintiff asserts that the only real issue in the case was whether her decedent died as a result of injuries sustained in a fall or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>whether he suffered and died of a heart attack which caused him to fall on the stairs. It must first be noted that the trial court used the terms \u201cconcurrent proximate cause\u201d only by way of background or in conjunction with its use of examples to explain further the meaning of the specific policy language in question. Thus, we do not find that the court\u2019s use of these terms resulted in the interjection of irrelevant issues into the case. In addition, and more importantly, even assuming that the use of these terms was confusing or misleading to the jury, the trial court\u2019s supplemental charge clearly removed these terms from the jury\u2019s consideration. In response to the exceptions taken by both counsel to the initial charge and prior to the start of its deliberations, the trial court summoned the jury back to the courtroom and further instructed that \u201c [concurrent cause or dominant cause of some bodily infirmity or disease is not part of the case. The sole issue in the case ... is whether the death resulted directly and independently of all other causes from bodily injuries from the accident. And that is the focus of your concern. You shouldn\u2019t be concerned with concurrent causes by other bodily injury or infirmity. The issue again under the language of the policy is whether the loss has resulted directly and independently of all other causes from bodily injuries caused by an accident.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">The plaintiff further claims that the court should have charged the jury that the accident had only to be the predominant cause and not the sole or direct cause of the loss. While a number of jurisdictions have interpreted similar language in accidental injury and or death policies to require that the accident must be only the \u201cefficient\u201d or \u201cpredominant cause\u201d of the injury or death to the insured; see <em>Barker </em>v. <em>INA Life Ins. Co., </em>607 F. Sup. 1075, 1077 (D.D.C. 1985); <em>Continental Casualty Co. </em>v. <em>Maguire, </em>471 P.2d 636, 638-39 (Colo. App. 1970); <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Mountain States Telephone </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number><em>&amp; Telegraph Co., </em>105 Idaho 520, 670 P.2d 1305 (1983); <em>Duhon v. Colonial Life &amp; Accident Ins. Co., </em>277 So. 2d 234, 236 (La. App. 1973); such is not the law of this state. Therefore, the trial court properly refused to charge as requested by the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-6\">Accordingly, we conclude that the trial court\u2019s charge was correct in law and was properly adapted to this case. The only issue, as presented by the parties, was whether the plaintiff\u2019s decedent died as a result of injuries sustained in a fall down the stairs, or whether he died as a result of a heart attack which was the cause of his fall down the stairs. The trial court properly limited the jury\u2019s deliberations to this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-7\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-8\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b237-6\"> At trial, the plaintiffs medical expert, Paul D. Ephraim, an internist, testified that, in his opinion, the plaintiff\u2019s decedent died after \u201che fell and suffered a head injury and a brain injury that resulted in probable temporary cessation in his respiration and this led to the anoxic brain damage.\u201d He further testified that the brain damage subsequently caused other vital organs to fail, thus necessitating the cessation of resuscitative measures at the hospital.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b237-7\"> The defendant\u2019s medical expert, Wayne H. Carver, a forensic pathologist, described an arrhythmia as a \u201cdisturbance of the heart rhythm leading the heart to shut down, causing poor, low quantities of oxygen to reach-the brain and the entire brain or the most sensitive cells in the brain, the neurons, the ones that actually do the work, are dying and leaving you with a coma.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b237-8\"> Contrary to the opinion of Ephraim, Carver, who was the acting chief medical examiner for the state of Connecticut, testified that the \u201cunderlying cause [of the plaintiff\u2019s decedent\u2019s death] was heart disease, specifically cardiomegaly with fibrosis, or simply termed, enlarged heart. Probably from high blood pressure which led to an arrhythmia, which led to a stoppage of the heart, which led to the death of brain cells and then the last, from there led to the entire trail that led to the deterioration of his other organs.\u201d Carver further testified that the arrhythmia which caused the plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>tiffs decedent\u2019s heart to stop occurred while he was on the stairs, which in turn, caused him to collapse and fall down the stairs. Carver also specifically testified that there was no evidence whatsoever to indicate that the plaintiffs decedent suffered a head injury in the fall which could have caused brain damage.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b238-11\"> The plaintiff also raised the following issue in.her preliminary statement of issues: \u201cWas the trial court correct in directing a verdict in favor of the defendant as against the plaintiff estate where that estate was neither a party to nor a beneficiary under the insurance policy, and where there was no evidence that an estate existed or that Adele Ellice was an executrix of any such estate.\u201d While there is no dispute that the trial court directed a verdict for the defendant on the plaintiff\u2019s claim as executrix of her husband\u2019s estate, the plaintiff failed to brief the issue and did not pursue this claim at oral argument before this court. Consequently, w\u2019e deem the claim to have been abandoned and we decline to address it. State v. <em>Gaines, </em>196 Conn. 395, 398 n.2, 493 A.2d 209 (1985); <em>State </em>v. <em>Martin, </em>195 Conn. 166, 167 n.1, 487 A.2d 177 (1985).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b239-8\"> At oral argument before this court, the plaintiff also argued that evidence of the fact that the arm had been fractured five days prior to October 20,1982, is relevant to her burden of proof in that it reveals the absence of a suicide attempt and that the fall resulted from the pain in the arm, thus indicating the injuries were accidentally inflicted. Besides the fact that this argument lacks any evidentiary basis, we find it to be totally irrelevant because the record fails to reflect that the defendant ever put suicide into issue. Therefore, we decline to address the claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b239-9\"> The plaintiff testified to these facts in the absence of the jury. The jury never was told the specific cause of the plaintiffs decedent\u2019s fractured arm.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b242-9\"> At various points throughout the record both the plaintiff and the defendant refer to the fact that the plaintiffs decedent died from either the head and brain injuries he sustained when he was startled and fell down the stairs, or from a <em>heart attack </em>he had while on the stairs that caused him to fall. It appears that both parties\u2019 references to a heart attack are erroneous and inadvertent. Carver testified that an arrhythmia occurred which had caused the plaintiff\u2019s decedent\u2019s heart to stop, which caused him to collapse and fall down the stairs. Carver also went on to differentiate between an arrhythmia and a primary cardiac event such as a heart attack. Therefore, we will treat the parties\u2019 references to a heart attack to mean an arrhythmia. It must be noted that whether he fell as a result of a heart attack or a heart stoppage brought about by an arrhythmia is of no consequence because in either case there would be no coverage under the policy.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b245-7\"> For similar holdings in other jurisdictions see <em>Tschohl </em>v. <em>Nationwide Mutual Ins.
