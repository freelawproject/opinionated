J.</author>\n<p id=\"ANx\">The sole question in this case is whether an administrative agency has jurisdiction to revoke the license of a Connecticut physician even though the license expired by lapse of time prior to the initiation of revocation proceedings. The plaintiff, P. Gary Stern, M.D., appeals from the judgment of the trial court upholding the decision of the Connecticut medical examining board (board) revoking his license to practice medicine. We find error.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-10\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b511-11\">The facts of this case are not disputed. In late 1979 and early 1980, the plaintiff was the subject of several overlapping investigations into alleged professional misconduct. The department of consumer protection <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>pursued charges that the plaintiff had excessively prescribed controlled substances and had failed to maintain proper records. As a result, the plaintiff surrendered his Connecticut controlled substance registration. A second inquiry was conducted at Mount Sinai Hospital to determine whether the plaintiff\u2019s affiliation with that hospital should be terminated. This investigation resulted in the plaintiff\u2019s forfeiture of staff privileges. The Hartford County Medical Society began its own investigation of the plaintiff\u2019s fitness to practice medicine. Finally, the department of health services (department), acting on a complaint, launched an investigation. It is from the department\u2019s investigation that the charges in this case originated.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">Since 1980, the plaintiff has ceased to be licensed to practice medicine in this state. His license expired, by its own terms, on January 31, 1980, and the plaintiff did not apply for its renewal.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In April and May of 1980, settlement negotiations took place between a department agent and the plaintiff\u2019s attorney, in an effort to fashion a consent decree to accompany revocation or suspension of the plaintiff\u2019s license. These negotiations proved to be unsuccessful. On July 22,1980, the plaintiff, through his attorney, returned his license to the board, explaining that he was voluntarily surrendering any right to practice in Connecticut and that he was no longer a resident of the state. He now resides in Florida and has established a medical practice there.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-6\">In the summer of 1981, the board notified the plaintiff\u2019s attorney that the department, which acts as the prosecuting authority in physician disciplinary cases, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>had decided to issue a statement of charges against the plaintiff. In response by letter, the plaintiffs attorney questioned the authority of the board or the department to proceed against a physician who, by expiration or surrender, no longer held a valid license to practice in this state.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\">In November, 1983, the department filed a forty-four count statement of charges against the plaintiff. Two principal forms of misconduct were alleged. The plaintiff was first accused of excessively and improperly prescribing controlled substances and of failing to maintain proper records of dispensed controlled substances. In addition, the plaintiff was accused of sexual misconduct in having intercourse with, and taking nude photographs of, his female patients. In its prayer for relief, the department requested that the board \u201cfind for any or all of the above reasons, that P. Gary Stern is unable to practice medicine with reasonable skill and/or safety and that the Board <em>revoke the license </em>of P. Gary Stern to practice medicine.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b513-6\">A notice of hearing was issued by the board in November, 1983. After receiving actual notice in Florida, the plaintiff hired new counsel in Hartford. His counsel promptly asked a department attorney for a continuance. The hearing nevertheless was held as scheduled on November 30, 1983. The plaintiffs new counsel appeared at the hearing without filing or renewing with the board any oral or written motion for a continuance. Instead, counsel filed a motion to dismiss on two grounds: (1) lack of jurisdiction; and (2) laches. The board reserved decision on the motion. The department then presented eight witnesses to prove its charges against the plaintiff. Each witness was vigorously cross-examined by plaintiffs counsel. The plaintiff did not appear or testify on his own behalf. At the close of the hearing, plaintiffs counsel did not move for a continuance and did not indicate any interest in calling any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>defense witnesses. The hearing was adjourned without objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">The board found all of the charges proven, except for eight counts involving two female patients who did not testify. The board also denied the plaintiff\u2019s motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction, concluding that the surrender of his license had been done with intent to evade disciplinary action and therefore was not binding on the board.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The board did not consider the effect, if any, on its jurisdiction of the expiration of the plaintiff\u2019s license for lapse of time. The defense of laches was denied because, in the board\u2019s judgment, the plaintiff had not been prejudiced by the department\u2019s delay in filing charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-6\">In his administrative appeal to the Superior Court, the plaintiff did not contest the board\u2019s findings of misconduct. He instead reiterated his claim that the board lacked jurisdiction to revoke a medical license that, by automatic expiration or voluntary surrender, had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>ceased to exist prior to the filing of charges. He further claimed that the board\u2019s action was barred by laches and that the board had denied him due process of law by virtue of inadequately short notice of the hearing date. The trial court denied the appeal on all three grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">On appeal to this court, the plaintiff renews the jurisdictional and due process claims that the trial court rejected. We conclude that, under the facts and circumstances of this case, the board lacked jurisdiction to revoke the plaintiff\u2019s license. Accordingly, we do not address his alternative claim of a due process violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b515-7\">The plaintiff\u2019s jurisdictional claim arises from a juxtaposition of two related statutes involving the board\u2019s disciplinary authority. General Statutes (Rev. to 1983) \u00a7 20-13c provides that \u201c[t]he board is authorized to restrict, suspend or revoke the license ... of a physician in accordance with section 19a-17, when the board finds that such physician is unable to practice medicine with reasonable skill or safety . . . .\u201d The term \u201cphysician\u201d is defined in General Statutes (Rev. to 1983) \u00a7 20-13a (5) as \u201ca person licensed pursuant to [chapter 370] . . . .\u201d Having allowed his license to expire prior to the filing of disciplinary charges in this case, the plaintiff maintains that he was not a \u201cphysician\u201d within the scope of the board\u2019s disciplinary jurisdiction. The board, on the other hand, argues that, for jurisdiction to attach, the practitioner need only commit acts of alleged misconduct during his or her licensure. It is not necessary, according to the board, that the practitioner hold a license when actual charges are filed. In its view, the plaintiff\u2019s position would eviscerate the regulatory power of the board in contravention of legislative intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>Our task is to determine whether the statutory jurisdiction of the board extends to the revocation of a license that expired by lapse of time prior to the commencement of formal proceedings. An administrative agency, as a tribunal of limited jurisdiction, must act strictly within its statutory authority. <em>Castro </em>v. <em>Viera, </em>207 Conn. 420, 428, 541 A.2d 1216 (1988); <em>Waterbury </em>v. <em>Commission on Human Rights &amp; Opportunities, </em>160 Conn. 226, 230, 278 A.2d 771 (1971). In exercising its disciplinary jurisdiction, the medical examining board \u201cpossesses no inherent power. Its authority is found in a legislative grant, beyond the terms and necessary implications of which it cannot lawfully function.\u201d <em>Adam </em>v. <em>Connecticut Medical Examining Board, </em>137 Conn. 535, 537-38, 79 A.2d 350 (1951); General Statutes \u00a7 19a-10. Absent a grant of authority, any sanction meted out by the board is \u201cnecessarily void.\u201d <em>Newington </em>v. <em>Mazzoccoli, </em>133 Conn. 146, 156, 48 A.2d 729 (1946). If the sanction was within the limits prescribed by law, however, it may be challenged only for an abuse of discretion in its imposition. <em>Paley </em>v. <em>Connecticut Medical Examining Board, </em>142 Conn. 522, 529, 115 A.2d 448 (1955).</p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">The board derives its authority from three principal statutes: \u00a7\u00a7 19a-17, 20-8a and 20-13c. While none of these statutes expressly resolves the question that we confront in this case, all three confer authority upon the board to revoke licenses. Our first order of business, then, is to reconcile these interrelated provisions in order to achieve a sensible overall interpretation that is faithful to the intent of the legislature. <em>Obuchowski </em>v. <em>Dental Commission, </em>149 Conn. 257, 266, 178 A.2d 537 (1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b516-6\">Subsection (a) (1) of General Statutes \u00a7 19a-17<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> gives the board the authority to \u201c[rjevoke a <em>practitioner\u2019s </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>license.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The term \u201cpractitioner\u201d is not defined by the statute. From the context of the statute, however, it is obvious that \u00a7 19a-17 is designed to be an omnibus charter of available disciplinary sanctions for many professional boards and commissions. It is therefore not surprising that \u00a7 19a-17 employs the general term \u201cpractitioner\u201d to describe the class of persons subject to its terms. The terms of \u00a7 19a-17 define the outer limit of the disciplinary jurisdiction of boards and commissions within the department of health services. Whether separate provisions that govern specific professions narrow the scope of \u00a7 19a-17 must be determined on a case-by-case basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">General Statutes \u00a7 20-8a<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> implements the general mandate of \u00a7 19a-17 for the profession of medicine and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>surgery. Subsection (e) of \u00a7 20-8a provides that the \u201cboard shall (1) hear and decide matters concerning suspension or revocation of licensure, (2) adjudicate complaints against practitioners and (3) impose sanctions where appropriate.\u201d Rather than conferring new powers or limiting ones already conferred, \u00a7 20-8a creates an administrative agency for the supervision of physicians and vests that agency with authority to impose the disciplinary actions set forth in \u00a7 19a-17.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">Finally, General Statutes \u00a7 20-13c<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> authorizes the board to \u201crestrict, suspend or revoke the license . . . of a physician\u201d for any of seven specified reasons. This section was enacted in 1976 as part of an overhaul of the licensure regulation of Connecticut physicians. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>Prior to 1976, physicians were subject to license regulation under General Statutes (Rev. to 1975) \u00a7 20-45, a general provision that applies to \u201cany licensed or registered practitioner of the healing arts in this state.\u201d With the passage of Public Acts 1976, No. 76-276, however, the legislature established new rules for use in licensure proceedings exclusively against physicians. At the very least, the legislature\u2019s judgment that physicians are to be evaluated under a separate licensure regime causes us to pay particular heed to its detailed provisions. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Champagne, </em>206 Conn. 421, 435-36, 538 A.2d 193 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">In light of this statutory scheme, we conclude that the board had no jurisdiction to revoke the plaintiff\u2019s license in this case. Central to our conclusion is the narrow scope of the department\u2019s prayer for relief, which requested only the revocation of the plaintiff\u2019s license.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-6\">In an ordinary civil case, the general rule is that a prayer for relief must articulate with specificity the form of relief that is sought. <em>Francis T. Zappone Co. </em>v. <em>Mark, </em>197 Conn. 264, 269-70, 497 A.2d 32 (1985); <em>Leone </em>v. <em>Knighton, </em>196 Conn. 494, 497-98, 493 A.2d 887 (1985); <em>Hydro-Hercules Corporation </em>v. <em>Gary Excavating, Inc., </em>166 Conn. 647, 655, 353 A.2d 714 (1974). A party who fails to comply with this rule runs the risk of being denied recovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-7\">In the administrative context, a proper claim for relief serves the equally vital function of establishing the jurisdictional authority of the tribunal. Unlike the general jurisdiction of the Superior Court; <em>Carten </em>v. <em>Carten, </em>153 Conn. 603, 612, 219 A.2d 711 (1966); the jurisdiction of an administrative body is not to be presumed and must be established affirmatively by the notice of hearing and statement of charges in any given case. Just recently, we held that the existence of an employee-employer relationship is a jurisdictional fact <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>that must be shown in order to proceed with a claim for workers\u2019 compensation benefits. <em>Castro </em>v. <em>Viera, </em>supra, 427-35. Similarly, the death of a decedent is a jurisdictional prerequisite to the administration of an estate in probate proceedings. <em>Ruick </em>v. <em>Twarkins, </em>171 Conn. 149, 153, 367 A.2d 1380 (1976). These cases stand for the principle that certain jurisdictional facts are essential to establish the statutory jurisdiction of tribunals of limited authority. The existence of these facts \u201cis fundamental to the power to entertain and adjudicate a proceeding on the merits. In short, such facts condition the power to act.\u201d <em>Castro </em>v. <em>Viera, </em>supra, 434.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">The critical jurisdictional fact in the present case was the licensure status of the plaintiff at the commencement of the proceedings. The authority of the board is contingent upon a showing that a respondent is a \u201cphysician\u201d subject to its disciplinary power. General Statutes \u00a7 20-13c. According to \u00a7 20~13a (5), a \u201cphysician\u201d is any \u201cperson licensed pursuant to [chapter 370].\u201d In its statement of charges, the department did not specify any intention to pursue its options under \u00a7 19a-17 for a censure, letter of reprimand or civil penalty. Nor did the department include in its prayer for relief a general request for any administrative action that, in the board\u2019s discretion, might be appropriate in this case. Having committed itself to seeking only a license revocation, the department disabled itself from invoking other sanctions theoretically authorized by \u00a7 19a-17 as a basis for board jurisdiction. In short, we conclude that the narrowly drawn prayer for relief rendered the case subject to dismissal for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-6\">Our conclusion is analogous to the holdings of courts in other states that have dismissed complaints against judges who no longer hold office when formal proceedings are initiated. In <em>In re Fienberg, </em>139 Vt. 511, 512, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>430 A.2d 1282 (1981), a state judge was retired by operation of law shortly before formal disciplinary accusations about his judicial conduct were made. The Vermont Supreme Court dismissed the complaint for lack of jurisdiction. Facing a similar jurisdictional problem, the New Jersey Supreme Court concluded that the accused, having resigned from his judgeship, was before the court only in his capacity as a member of the bar, but not as a judge. <em>In re De Lucia, </em>76 N.J. 329, 336, 387 A.2d 362 (1978). The court in <em>In re De Lucia </em>thus recognized that a judge, by virtue of his or her continuing status as a member of the bar, cannot evade disciplinary supervision in toto.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">Arguably, the board in this case might have had similar continuing jurisdiction to levy a monetary fine on the plaintiff pursuant to \u00a7 19a-17, which authorizes the assessment of a civil penalty of up to $1000 on any \u201cpractitioner.\u201d The plaintiff, while no longer a \u201cphysician\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 20-13a (5), might still have been subject to nonlicensure sanctions applicable to a \u201cpractitioner.\u201d But <em>see Mangels </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Motor Vehicles, </em>40 Conn. Sup. 226, 228-30, 487 A.2d 1121 (1984) (concluding that the commissioner of motor vehicles lacked jurisdiction to levy a fine against a former licensee even though the misconduct underlying the fine took place during the period of licensure). Given the limited form of relief sought in this case, however, we do not reach the merits of this question.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">Our conclusion that the board lacked the power to revoke a physician\u2019s expired license does not strip the board of the powers it needs to protect the public from renegade medical practitioners. At the outset, we doubt that most physicians would consciously elect the forfeiture of their entire Connecticut practices merely to evade licensure overview in this state. More important, the board is authorized, by its own regulations, to deny <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>relicensure to a former licensee if \u201cthe candidate had been the subject of complaints, investigations or disciplinary actions as a licensed professional.\u201d Regs., Conn. State Agencies \u00a7 19a-14-2 (4). The board \u201cmust\u201d take this factor into consideration before granting relicensure, according to this regulation. A further regulation provides that \u201c[n]o license shall be issued if there is a complaint awaiting adjudication against the applicant . . . with the Department of Health Services until such a time as it is resolved in favor of the candidate.\u201d Regs., Conn. State Agencies \u00a7 19a-14-4. In addition, the department has \u201cdiscretion\u201d to deny relicensure if the candidate is deemed not to meet this standard. Regs., Conn. State Agencies \u00a7 19a-14-3.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">To fulfill the mandate of these regulations, the department has broad authority to conduct whatever investigations may be necessary to gather and preserve evidence of misconduct for eventual use against a former licensee who applies for relicensure. General Statutes \u00a7 19a-14 (a) (11) empowers the department to \u201c[cjonduct any necessary investigation and follow-up in connection with complaints regarding <em>persons subject to regulation or licensing </em>by the department.\u201d (Emphasis added.) In addition, \u00a7 19a-14 (a) (12) authorizes the department to \u201c[pjerform any other function necessary to the effective operation of a board . . . and not specifically vested by statute in the board . . . .\u201d Nothing in the language of these provisions limits the department\u2019s investigatory power to current license holders. To the contrary, \u00a7 19a-14 (a) (11) plainly applies to all \u201cpersons subject to regulation or licensing.\u201d A former licensee who retains the option of applying for relicensure continues to be \u201csubject to\u201d the regulatory authority of the department, particularly if complaints have been filed against him or her. These provisions confer sufficient regulatory authority upon the department and the board to enable them to carry <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>out their respective functions despite our conclusion in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-5\">There is error, the judgment is set aside and the case is remanded with direction to sustain the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-6\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b512-7\"> General Statutes (Rev. to 1983) \u00a7 19a-88 (b) provides that \u201c[ejach person holding a license to practice medicine . . . shall, annually, during the month of his birth, register with the department of health services . . . . \u201d Subsection (f) provides that the license of \u201c[a]ny person who fails to comply with the provisions of this section . . . shall become void\u201d upon the expiration of a ninety day renewal period.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b514-7\"> Because we conclude that the license expired by operation of law, we need not consider what effect, if any, the surrender of the license might have had on the jurisdiction of the board. We note, however, that the power of a physician unilaterally to surrender a medical license is an unsettled point of law. The plaintiff argues that <em>Gavlas </em>v. <em>State Department of Health, </em>108 Conn. 86, 142 A.2d 388 (1928), held that the surrender of a license to an appropriate agency is tantamount to a revocation and therefore divests the board of jurisdiction in this case. As the defendant correctly notes, however, <em>Gavias </em>did not involve the problem of a surrender in the face of imminent disciplinary charges. Courts in other jurisdictions have held, under varying circumstances, that licensees are not entitled to surrender their licenses as of right, during the pendency of disciplinary proceedings, in order to thwart agency jurisdiction. See, e.g., <em>Boedy </em>v. <em>Department of Professional Regulation, </em>433 So. 2d 544 (Fla. App. 1983); <em>Cross </em>v. <em>Colorado State Board of Dental Examiners, </em>37 Colo. App. 504, 508, 552 P.2d 38 (1976); <em>Cal Pacific Collections, Inc. </em>v. <em>Powers, </em>70 Cal. 2d 135, 139-40, 449 P.2d 225, 74 Cal. Rptr. 289 (1969). In addition, it may be significant that no statute in Connecticut expressly permits or prevents a physician from surrendering his or her license. This lack of statutory direction is quite evident in light of the specific provision terminating a physician\u2019s license, by operation of law, if a timely renewal is not sought.
