The defendants are John O. Bailey, Richard Conrad, Adrienne Hedgspeth and the Jackson Newspapers, Inc. (collectively referred to as the Jackson Newspapers), and the FOIC. The plaintiffs are the New Haven Board of Education (board) and the New Haven Superintendent of Schools (superintendent). On July 10, 1986, the Jackson Newspapers wrote to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>board requesting access to records in order to inspect or copy the 1986 performance evaluation of the superintendent. The superintendent\u2019s office received the request on July 15, 1986. On July 29, 1986, the board informed the Jackson Newspapers that there was no written performance evaluation of the superintendent.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On September 30,1986, the Jackson Newspapers made a second request to inspect or copy the 1986 performance evaluation of the superintendent. The superintendent responded to the request on October 1, 1986, by mailing a copy of the board\u2019s July 29 letter to the Jackson Newspapers which stated that there was no written performance evaluation of the superintendent.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-4\">The Jackson Newspapers filed a complaint with the FOIC on October 30,1986. The complaint alleged that the board and the superintendent had violated the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA); General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 1-15, l-8a, 1-19 through l-19b, 1-21, l-21a and l-21c through l-21k; by refusing to release the performance evaluation of the superintendent. A FOIC hearing officer heard the complaint on November 24,1986. At the hearing, the board and the superintendent moved to dismiss the complaint on the ground that the Jackson Newspapers had not filed their notice of appeal within the time limit of General Statutes \u00a7 l-21i (b).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Specifi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>cally, they claimed that the \u00a7 l-21i (b) time limit for an appeal to the FOIC, which is thirty days after a denial of a request for information, should have commenced as of July 19, 1986, when the board had failed to respond within four business days of the request, and not on October 1, 1986, the date of the denial of the Jackson Newspapers\u2019 second request.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The FOIC found that there is no provision in the FOIA which precludes the Jackson Newspapers from renewing their initial request to inspect or copy public records. Consequently, the FOIC found that the Jackson Newspapers had complied with the time requirements for an appeal pursuant to \u00a7 l-21i (b) and the motion to dismiss was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-6\">At the hearing, the FOIC found that on November 10,1986, the board had issued a statement concluding that the superintendent\u2019s performance for the 1985-1986 year was excellent. Although the evaluation process was an oral one, the board\u2019s statement indicated that the board members had used a performance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>evaluation form in their evaluation of the superintendent. The FOIC further found that on several occasions the board convened in executive session<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> to discuss the performance evaluation. On the basis of the evidence presented, however, the FOIC found that it could not determine whether individual board members had used written forms during the 1986 evaluation of the superintendent. The FOIC nevertheless found that if written performance evaluation forms were used by board members, such forms were public records within the meaning of General Statutes \u00a7 l-18a (d), and disclosable under General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 1-15 and 1-19 (a)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> of the General Statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>The FOIC also found that the board\u2019s minutes of its November 10,1986 meeting indicated that a nonboard member recorder was present during an executive session held on that date. The FOIC stated, however, that it was unable to determine whether the recorder had any records concerning the performance evaluation of the superintendent. Nevertheless, the FOIC concluded that if the nonboard member had any performance evaluation records, such records were public records within the meaning of \u00a7 l-18a (d), and disclosable under \u00a7\u00a7 1-15 and 1-19 (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>On the basis of its findings, the FOIC issued an order to the board directing it to provide the Jackson Newspapers with affidavits from nontestifying board members and from each nonagency member present at the November 10 executive session, stating whether he or she had any records relating to the superintendent\u2019s evaluation. The FOIC further ordered the board to provide the Jackson Newspapers with a copy of any records disclosed by the affidavits. Included in the order were criticisms of the manner in which the board conducted its performance evaluation of the superintendent.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The plaintiffs appealed the FOIC\u2019s orders to the Superior Court. The trial court dismissed the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-6\">From the judgment rendered in the Superior Court, the plaintiffs appealed to the Appellate Court, claiming the trial court erred in: (1) refusing to reverse or modify the FOIC\u2019s finding that the Jackson Newspapers had complied with the statutory time limits of the FOIA where the finding contradicts the plain language of the FOIA and constitutes an abuse of discretion; (2) refusing to reverse or modify the substantive findings and orders of the FOIC where those findings and orders <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>are elearly erroneous in light of the reliable, probative and substantial evidence on the whole record; and (3) refusing to reverse or modify the denunciatory order number four of the FOIC where the order is in excess of statutory authority and is arbitrary and capricious, an abuse of discretion and in violation of the FOIA and General Statutes \u00a7 4-177. The appeal was transferred to this court pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4023. We find error.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">The plaintiffs claim that an appeal to the FOIC from an agency denial of an information request must be initiated within thirty days of the notice of the denial. Consequently, they argue that the trial court erred in refusing to reverse or modify the FOIC\u2019s finding that the Jackson Newspapers had timely filed their appeal to the FOIC.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-6\">This claim implicates General Statutes \u00a7 l-21i (b), which provides in pertinent part: \u201cAny person denied the right to inspect or copy records . . . may appeal therefrom to the freedom of information commission, by filing a notice of appeal with said commission. A notice of appeal shall be filed within thirty days after such denial . . . .\u201d The plaintiffs argue that the central question in this appeal is \u201chow many times must a public entity deny a person\u2019s request to inspect records before the statutory appeal mechanism of the FOIA is triggered.\u201d They assert that, absent evidence presented by the requester indicating error or mistake in the initial denial, a public agency\u2019s categorical denial of a request to inspect or copy records initiates the statutory appeal process, and that the Jackson Newspapers\u2019 failure to observe the time limits which control the appeal process bars it from pursuing this action. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>The plaintiffs have not referred to any part of \u00a7 1-2 li (b) that expressly limits appeals to the FOIC from an agency\u2019s denial of a party\u2019s first request for information. Indeed, such a restriction would be inconsistent with the general policy of openness expressed in the FOIA legislation. \u201cThe Freedom of Information Act expresses a strong legislative policy in favor of the open conduct of government and free public access to government records.\u201d <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>181 Conn. 324, 328, 435 A.2d 353 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b468-6\">In support of their claim, the respondents rely <em>on Zoning Board of Appeals </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>198 Conn. 498, 505, 503 A.2d 1161 (1986), where we held that the time limitations prescribed by \u00a7 l-21i (b) for the FOIC to hear and decide appeals were mandatory and not directory, and that the FOIC\u2019s failure to hear and decide cases within those time limits invalidated any subsequent action by the FOIC. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>however, did not involve the question of whether a party may, in good faith, file with the same agency successive requests for identical public records and thereafter appeal to the FOIC within thirty days from the denial of a particular request.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-7\">The language of \u00a7 l-21i (b) at issue here is unambiguous. In construing a statute the court is confined to the intention expressed in the words used by the legislature. Bas<em>ton </em>v. <em>Ricci, </em>174 Conn. 522, 528, 391 A.2d 161 (1978). \u201cWe have consistently held that if a statute is clear and unambiguous, there is no room for construction. <em>State </em>v. <em>James, </em>197 Conn. 358, 363, 497 A.2d 402 (1985); <em>State </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>194 Conn. 213, 222, 479 A.2d 814 (1984); <em>Moscone </em>v. <em>Manson, </em>185 Conn. 124, 128, 440 A.2d 848 (1981).\u201d <em>Murray </em>v. <em>Lopes, </em>205 Conn. 27, 33, 529 A.2d 1302 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b469-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>Any person denied the right to inspect or copy public records of an agency may appeal the denial to the FOIC by filing a notice of appeal \u201cwithin thirty days after such denial.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 l-21i (b). The statute does not bar successive requests, nor does it bar successive denials, nor does it require an appeal within thirty days of the denial of any particular request. We decline to engraft a judicial amendment upon the statute that would frustrate the \u201cstrong legislative policy in favor of the open conduct of government and free public access to government records.\u201d <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>supra, 328. We have reviewed \u00a7 1-2 li (b), and agree with the FOIC and the trial court that there is no provision in the statute precluding a party from making successive requests to an agency for the same records, where previous requests have been denied, barring him from appealing within thirty days of any denial.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b469-7\">The plaintiffs next claim that the trial court erred in refusing to reverse or modify the substantive findings and orders of the FOIC where those findings and orders are clearly erroneous in light of the reliable, probative and substantial evidence on the whole record. See General Statutes \u00a7 4-183 (g) (5).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The plaintiffs challenge finding number nineteen, in which the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>FOIC concluded that it could not determine whether individual members of the board had used written forms during the 1986 evaluation process, and finding number twenty-two, in which the FOIC concluded that it could not determine whether the recorder had any records concerning the performance evaluation.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-6\">\u201c \u2018 \u201cJudicial review of [an administrative agency\u2019s] action is governed by the Uniform Administrative Procedure Act (General Statutes, c. 54, \u00a7\u00a7 4-166 through 4-189), and the scope of that review is very restricted. <em>Lawrence </em>v. <em>Kozlowski, </em>171 Conn. 705, [707-708,] 372 A.2d 110 (1976) [cert. denied, 431 U.S. 969, 97 S. Ct. 2930, 53 L. Ed. 2d 1066 (1977)]. Neither this court nor the trial court may retry the case or substitute its own judgment for that of the [administrative agency].\u201d <em>C &amp; H Enterprises, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Motor Vehicles, </em>176 Conn. 11, 12, 404 A.2d 864 (1978); <em>DiBenedetto </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Motor Vehicles, </em>168 Conn. 587, 589, 362 A.2d 840 (1975); see General Statutes \u00a7 4-183 (g). \u201cThe court\u2019s ultimate duty is only to decide whether, in light of the evidence, the [agency] has acted unreasonably, arbitrarily, illegally, or in abuse of [its] discretion.\u201d <em>Burnham </em>v. <em>Administrator, </em>184 Conn. 317, 322, 439 A.2d 1008 (1981); <em>Riley </em>v. <em>State Employees\u2019Retirement Commission, </em>178 Conn. 438, 441, 423 A.2d 87 (1979); see also <em>Persico </em>v. <em>Maher, </em>191 Conn. 384, 409, 465 A.2d 308 (1983).\u2019 <em>Buckley </em>v. <em>Muzio, </em>200 Conn. 1, 3, 509 A.2d 489 (1986).\u201d <em>New Haven </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>205 Conn. 767, 773, 535 A.2d 1297 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b470-7\">We adhere to our rule that because the FOIC is the factfinder in this case, we decline to appraise and weigh the evidence considered by the FOIC in reaching its determination on the challenged findings. Because of the FOIC\u2019s finding that it was unable to determine from the record the existence of disclosable public records <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>within the meaning of General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 l-18a (d), 1-15 and 1-19 (a), we conclude that there is no basis for the orders that it -issued.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-6\">Plenary authority has been provided to the FOIC by the legislature to determine whether the board members and the nonboard member recorder had information or documents relevant to the FOIC\u2019s inquiry. Under General Statutes \u00a7 l-21j (d),<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> the FOIC has authority not only to investigate and hear complaints but also to subpoena witnesses, to have their attendance and testimony compelled, and to require the production for examination of any books or papers the FOIC deems relevant in any matter under investigation. In <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>supra, 340, we stated that where a public agency claims that its records are exempt from disclosure under the FOIA, the FOIC \u201cshould not accept an agency\u2019s generalized and unsupported allegations relating to documents claimed to be exempt from disclosure.\u201d We observed that \u201c[w]here the nature of the documents ... is in dispute it is not only within the [FOIC\u2019s] power to examine the documents themselves, it is contemplated by the [FOIA] that the [FOIC] do so. . . . [The FOIA] anticipates that the [FOIC] will play a central role in resolving disputes administratively under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>the [FOIA]. To fulfill this role effectively, the [FOIC\u2019s] determinations must be informed.\u201d Id., 339-40.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-6\">The FOIC has full authority to determine the existence of public records and the propriety of their disclosure. In this case, the FOIC has concluded that it was unable to determine whether any public records exist. Instead of utilizing its authority under \u00a7 l-21j (d), the FOIC ordered the board to provide the Jackson Newspapers with affidavits stating whether public records exist, and ^7the affidavits disclose that public records exist, to provide the Jackson Newspapers with a copy of the records. In issuing these orders the FOIC failed to determine whether the board had violated the FOIA by withholding any public records. It was essential that the FOIC find that there had been a violation before it was empowered to issue any final order.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-7\">Consistent with our analysis in <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>supra, regarding disputes pertaining to the nature of documents, we hold that where the existence of public records is in dispute, the FOIC\u2019s information gathering authority must be pursued as provided in General Statutes \u00a7 l-21j (d). Because of the FOIC\u2019s indeterminate finding regarding the existence of public records and its orders, the trial court erred in dismissing the plaintiffs\u2019 appeal. This disposition renders it unnecessary for us to consider the plaintiffs\u2019 claim regarding the denunciatory comments made by the FOIC.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-8\">There is error, the judgment is set aside and the case is remanded to the trial court with direction to sustain the plaintiffs\u2019 appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-9\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b462-5\"> Under General Statutes \u00a7 1-211 (a), the fact that the board failed to respond to the request of the Jackson Newspapers within four business days is deemed to be a denial of the request.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-6\">General Statutes \u00a7 l-21i (a) provides in pertinent part: \u201cdenial, of access to public records OR meetings. ...

The respondent board is a public agency accountable not to itself, but to the people of New Haven. One of its most important functions is to evaluate the superintendent of schools, the school system\u2019s chief executive officer. By abolishing the written evaluation process, the board leaves the citizens of New Haven without a meaningful assessment of the superintendent\u2019s performance for the 1985-86 year and conceals from public scrutiny its decision-making process. The board has acted irresponsibly by eliminating a written performance evaluation record of such a high level public official merely to avoid public oversight. In this case, the board, in effect, has left itself powerless to take any disciplinary action concerning the superintendent\u2019s performance as provided by contract. Moreover, the Commission believes that the respondents\u2019 fear of the public\u2019s reaction to the evaluation process insults the intelligence of the citizens of New Haven and has no place in the representative democracy.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b469-8\"><em> </em>\u201c[General Statutes] Sec. 4-183. appeal to superior court. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"AR0\">\u201c(g) The court shall not substitute its judgment for that of the agency as to the weight of the evidence on questions of fact.
