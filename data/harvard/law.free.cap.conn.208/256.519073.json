Anderson, a resident of Latimer Point, Stonington, commenced this equitable action against the defendant, Latimer Point Management Corporation (LPMC), his lessor, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>fourteen of his neighbors who were present or former directors of LPMC. The plaintiff sought an injunction restraining the defendants\u2019 interference with the proposed use of his Latimer Point property in a number of subject matter areas.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The plaintiff also claimed compensatory and punitive damages together with attorneys\u2019 fees.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">The trial court found some of the issues for the plaintiff and enjoined the defendants from: (1) interfering with the plaintiff\u2019s maintenance of certain shrubs, trees and other vegetation; (2) interfering with the plaintiff\u2019s membership in LPMC upon his payment of certain past due assessments; (3) pursuing the collection or levy of past fines from the plaintiff; and (4) pursuing a contemplated eviction of the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">The plaintiff has appealed, contending that the court erred in: (1) refusing to grant an injunction restraining LPMC\u2019s interference with a proposed second story addition to his cottage; (2) concluding that the plaintiff should pay a portion of past due assessments as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>condition to his membership in LPMC; and (3) refusing to award attorneys\u2019 fees. LPMC cross appealed claiming error in the court\u2019s failure to award attorneys\u2019 fees to the defendant corporation. We find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">The court found that Latimer Point is a peninsula located in Stonington. Prior to 1979, it was owned in its entirety by John Bindloss. Bindloss leased lots to various individuals who constructed summer homes upon them. Bindloss \u201cgoverned\u201d the peninsula and his approval was required for any proposed construction or planting. Part of his motive for this requirement was to maximize the water views for all the lessees. Although not perfectly accomplished, existing houses are situated on the various lots so as to afford the lessees a view of the water. Bindloss died in 1979, and Latimer Point was conveyed to Latimer Point Company, Inc.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">In 1972, the individual lessees formed Latimer Point Management Corporation (LPMC), a nonstock corporation, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 33-419 et seq. The purpose of the corporation was to lease, sublease, maintain and improve Latimer Point.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-7\">In 1979, Latimer Point Company, Inc., leased the entire peninsula to LPMC for a term of thirty years. LPMC in turn executed a series of identical subleases to the individual lot holders for thirty year terms. The subleases provided that each lot could have one private home to be maintained in its present location. Alterations to existing structures or material changes to the surface or vegetation required prior approval of the sublessor, which approvals <em>would not be unreasonably withheld. </em>With the exception of existing trees, vegetation was not to obstruct the water views of other sublessees.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-8\">In May, 1981, Percy Wilcox assigned his sublease of lot 10 to the plaintiff. The plaintiff applied to LPMC <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>for permission to add a second story to the dwelling on lot 10. The corporation denied his request. Having heard the evidence and after viewing the property, the trial court concluded that the required approval had been reasonably withheld because the proposed second story would substantially interfere with the water views of other sublessees.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-4\">The trial court further found that LPMC had denied the plaintiff his voting rights in LPMC and threatened his eviction by reason of his failure to pay dock assessments. He had also been fined by LPMC for failing to pay his pro rata share of other LPMC assessments, including legal expenses incurred in seeking to enforce the LPMC bylaws against the plaintiff. The trial.court concluded that a portion of the dock assessment had been unfairly levied against the plaintiff because LPMC had not timely notified the plaintiff that the town had assessed the docks.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The trial court also concluded that the sections of the bylaws sought to be enforced against the plaintiff were impermissibly vague and without standards. The trial court therefore concluded that the plaintiff need not pay the fines, the legal expense assessment and the 1981-1982 dock assessment but that the balance of the accrued assessments was owed by the plaintiff as an incident to his exercise of voting privileges in LPMC. The trial court also concluded that any contemplated eviction of the plaintiff for nonpayment of the erroneously levied fines and assessments was not in order.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">The plaintiff first claims error in the trial court\u2019s refusal to grant an injunction restraining interference with his proposed second story addition. In this connection he advances two arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>First, the plaintiff challenges the court\u2019s conclusion that LPMC acted reasonably in withholding permission for the addition because it would encroach on the view of the water from other properties. The plaintiff characterizes this conclusion as, in effect, creating \u201can easement of light or air by prescription or implication.\u201d The plaintiff argues that General Statutes \u00a7 47-25<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> prohibits the creation of such easements through adverse possession. The plaintiff cites no authority for the proposition that the court\u2019s ruling created such an easement nor does our research disclose this to be the case. We conclude that no prescriptive interest in favor of adjoining properties was created by the court\u2019s holding and therefore \u00a7 47-25 is inapplicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-4\">Second, the plaintiff argues that LPMC had no adequate rules, bylaws or other procedures governing construction applications. The trial court found the only specific reference in the bylaws concerning construction applications to be impermissibly vague and incapable of providing standards.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Although not specifically articulated, the plaintiff implies that these deficiencies in the LPMC bylaws somehow required the trial court to issue the injunctive relief requested. This argument overlooks the significant role of the exercise of the trial court\u2019s broad discretion in injunctive matters and the fact that the trial court could and did consider not only the language of the sublease between the parties but also the insights gained from personal inspection of the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>\u201cIt is clear that the power of equity to grant injunctive relief may be exercised only under demanding circumstances. <em>Leo Foundation </em>v. <em>Cahelus, </em>151 Conn. 655, 657, 201 A.2d 654 [1964]. . . . \u2018Restraining the action of an individual or a corporation by injunction is an extraordinary power, always to be exercised with caution, never without the most satisfactory reasons.\u2019 <em>Goodwin </em>v. <em>New York, N.H. &amp; H. R. Co., </em>43 Conn. 494, 500 [1876]; <em>Ginsberg </em>v. <em>Mascia, </em>149 Conn. 502, 505, 182 A.2d 4 [1962].\u201d <em>Nicholson </em>v. <em>Connecticut Half-Way House, Inc., </em>153 Conn. 507, 511, 218 A.2d 383 (1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b280-4\">\u201cWe have repeatedly held that the issuance of an injunction rests in the sound discretion of the trial court.\u201d <em>Berin </em>v. <em>Olson, </em>183 Conn. 337, 340, 439 A.2d 357 (1981). \u201c[I]ts action will not be disturbed unless it has abused its discretion.\u201d <em>Connecticut Light &amp; Power Co. </em>v. <em>Holson Co., </em>185 Conn. 436, 440, 440 A.2d 935 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">The trial court viewed the premises, found that the proposed addition would substantially interfere with the water views of others, and declined to grant the requested injunction against LPMC. \u201c[T]he visual observations made by the trier on a visit to the property are as much evidence as the evidence presented for his consideration by the witnesses under oath.\u201d <em>Houston </em>v. <em>Highway Commissioner, </em>152 Conn. 557, 558, 210 A.2d 176 (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b280-6\">The court assessed the relative harm to others should the injunction issue and concluded that its entry was inappropriate. \u201c \u2018In exercising its discretion, the court, in a proper case, may consider and balance the injury complained of with that which will result from interference by injunction. . . .\u2019 <em>Moore </em>v. <em>Serafin, </em>163 Conn. 1, 6, 301 A.2d 238 (1972).\u201d <em>Sterner </em>v. <em>Saugatuck Harbor Yacht Club, Inc., </em>188 Conn. 531, 541-42, 450 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>A.2d 369 (1982). We therefore find no abuse of discretion in the trial court\u2019s declining to issue the requested injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b281-6\">The plaintiff next claims that the trial court erred in ordering that he pay a portion of certain past due assessments levied by LPMC as a condition to his participation as a member in good standing in LPMC. He argues that in a prior suit between the parties<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> LPMC could have raised the past due assessments issue and that, it having failed to do so, the issue is now res judicata as between these parties. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-7\">Examination of the complaint discloses that the plaintiff alleged that \u201cthe defendant corporation has sought to collect dues, assessments, fines, and alike, from the plaintiff even though the plaintiff was denied participation in said corporation during the time applicable to the dues, assessments, etc.\u201d LPMC denied this allegation.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-8\">The plaintiff\u2019s theory was that the assessments were not due because LPMC had denied him participation in the corporation. The theory at trial was not, as he now alleges, that LPMC\u2019s claim to assessments was barred by res judicata, a legal doctrine which must be specially pleaded. Practice Book \u00a7 164.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-9\">Since the plaintiff had not alleged that res judicata was implicated in the determination of the assessment issue, \u201c[t]he trial court was entitled to follow the theory on which the case was tried. <em>Alexander </em>v. <em>Alexander, </em>107 Conn. 101, 106, 139 A. 685 [1927].\u201d <em>Housing Authority </em>v. <em>Pezenik, </em>137 Conn. 442, 448, 78 A.2d 546 (1951). Moreover, \u201c[a] party cannot present a case to the trial court on one theory and then ask a reversal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>in this court on another. <em>Arcari </em>v. <em>Dellaripa, </em>164 Conn. 532, 537, 325 A.2d 280 [1973] . . . .\u201d (Citation omitted.) <em>Silverman </em>v. <em>St. Joseph\u2019s Hospital, </em>168 Conn. 160, 176-77, 363 A.2d 22 (1975). Accordingly, we do not address this issue further.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b282-6\">Finally, both parties have appealed the denial of their requests for attorneys\u2019 fees. The plaintiff claims an award pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 42-150bb,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> while LPMC claims to be entitled under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We disagree with both contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>A</p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">Section 42-150bb is a statutory authorization for attorneys\u2019 fees to be awarded \u201cas a matter of law to the consumer who successfully prosecutes or defends an action or a counterclaim based upon [a] contract or lease\u201d when that consumer is a party to a lease that provides for attorneys\u2019 fees to the lessor. The trial court found that the sublease here in issue, which provided for attorneys\u2019 fees to the sublessor, fell within this statutory definition of a \u201clease\u201d but declined to award counsel fees for the reason that the plaintiff had not successfully prosecuted a claim under the lease. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">The orders entered in behalf of the plaintiff concerning vegetation, assessments, LPMC membership and eviction were all based on inadequacies found by the court in the LPMC bylaws and not in the sublease. Thus, the court was correct in concluding that the plaintiff had not successfully prosecuted his action under the lease. The defendants, however, had also filed a counterclaim seeking: (1) a mandatory injunction directing the plaintiff\u2019s removal of certain unapproved vegetation; (2) an injunction restraining his further planting; and (3) an injunction restraining his addition of a second story to his house. The court rendered judgment for the plaintiff on the counterclaim. The further issue <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>thus remains as to whether the plaintiffs successful defense of this counterclaim entitles him to an award of attorneys\u2019 fees under \u00a7 42-150bb.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">The vegetation issues were decided on the basis of the inadequate bylaws and not on considerations involving the sublease. The issue of adding the second story was resolved against the plaintiff on the basis of his complaint and not the counterclaim. Therefore, the court\u2019s rendering of a judgment in favor of the plaintiff on the counterclaim does not, in reality, constitute a successful defense of a counterclaim under the lease. Therefore, \u00a7 42-150bb is not applicable and the court correctly concluded that attorneys\u2019 fees were not authorized.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b284-7\">LPMC based its claim for attorneys\u2019 fees on the provisions of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988. Section 1988 provides that \u201cin any action or proceeding to enforce a provision of [section] . . . 1983 . . . the court, <em>in its discretion, </em>may allow the prevailing party ... a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee as part of the costs.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b284-8\">The first count of the plaintiff\u2019s complaint purported to state a cause of action under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The trial court rejected this claim. On the basis of \u00a7 1988, LPMC then sought an award of attorneys\u2019 fees. The court concluded that the plaintiff\u2019s claim that LPMC\u2019s conduct constituted state action that had violated his civil rights under \u00a7 42 U.S.C. 1983, although novel, was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>not frivolous and had been made in good faith. It therefore declined to award attorneys\u2019 fees pursuant to the exercise of the discretion authorized by the statute. This court will not interfere except in the case of a clear abuse of that discretion. <em>Link </em>v. <em>Shelton, </em>186 Conn. 623, 629, 443 A.2d 902 (1982). Under the circumstances of this case, we find no error in the exercise of the court\u2019s statutorily authorized discretion in declining LPMC\u2019s claim for attorneys\u2019 fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-4\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b276-7\"> Specifically, the plaintiff sought an injunction prohibiting the defendants from: (1) interfering with his proposed addition of a second story to the existing cottage; (2) interfering with the installation of a well; (3) interfering with other construction that would include a garage; (4) interfering with the planting and maintenance of shrubs and other vegetation; (5) erecting a fence; (6) barring his participation as a member in LPMC; (7) collecting previously levied fines, penalties and assessments; (8) interfering with his peaceful and quiet enjoyment of the premises; (9) interfering with his proposed use of existing waterfront improvements; (10) discriminating in the application of the rules, regulations and sublease provisions of LPMC; and (11) any proposed eviction.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b276-8\"> The plaintiffs amended complaint contained four counts. The first purported to set forth a cause of action under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 for violation of the plaintiffs federal constitutional and state constitutional rights. The second claimed that LPMC was improperly organized under the Connecticut nonstock corporation laws. The third alleged the breach of the terms of a sublease contract executed by LPMC and assigned to the plaintiff. Finally, the fourth count claimed that LPMC had established and sought to enforce rules and regulations that were impermissibly vague and contrary to the Connecticut nonstock corporation laws.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b278-7\"> In 1981-1982 the docks were taxed as separate entities for the first time.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b279-5\"> General Statutes \u00a7 47-25 provides: \u201cNo occupant of real estate may acquire, by adverse occupation, the right to keep, sustain or enjoy any window or light, so as to prevent the owner of adjoining premises from erecting and maintaining any building thereon.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b279-7\"> Section R-17 of the LPMC bylaws provides: \u201cAll plans for construction, reconstruction or additions shall have the prior written approval of the Board of Directors, subject to appeal in the same manner as provided in Section 11 of these By-Laws.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b281-10\"> <em>Latimer Point Management Corporation </em>v. <em>Anderson, </em>1 Conn.
