COURT OF THE UNITED STATES</p>\n<author id=\"b1374-5\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b1374-6\">The Court hereby vacates its prior opinion, issued on 8 October 2014, and substitutes this corrected opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1374-7\">In <em>Lane v. Cent. Ala. Cmty. Coll., </em>523 Fed.Appx. 709 (11th Cir.2013) (per curiam), we affirmed the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of Steve Franks, former president of Central Alabama Community College (\u201cCACC\u201d), in Lane\u2019s 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 civil action alleging retaliation in violation of the First Amendment. We concluded \u2014 based on existing Eleventh Circuit precedent \u2014 that Lane\u2019s subpoenaed testimony at a federal criminal trial about acts that he performed as part of his official duties as a CACC employee was not speech made \u201cprimarily in [Lane\u2019s] role as a citizen\u201d and, thus, was not protected by the First Amendment. <em>Id. </em>at. 712. We also said that, even if a First Amendment violation had occurred, Franks would be entitled to qualified immunity from the claim against him individually because Lane\u2019s First Amendment right was not clearly established under then-existing law. <em>Id. </em>at 711 n. 2. Because we determined that no First Amendment violation occurred, we had no need to decide whether Franks was entitled to sovereign immunity from Lane\u2019s claim against him in his official capacity.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 711.</p>\n<p id=\"b1374-8\">The United States Supreme Court granted certiorari and, in <em>Lane v. Franks, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 134 S.Ct. 2369, 189 L.Ed.2d 312 (2014), affirmed in part and reversed in part our decision and remanded the case for further proceedings. The Supreme Court concluded that Lane\u2019s subpoenaed trial testimony <em>was </em>protected by the First Amendment. The Supreme Court said that \u201c[t]ruthful testimony under oath by a public employee outside the scope of his ordinary job duties is speech as a citizen for First Amendment purposes ... even when the testimony relates to his public employment or concerns information learned during that employment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2378. Because Lane testified about a matter of public concern, and because CCAC offered no justification for treating Lane differently from other members of the general public, Lane\u2019s testimony was protected under the First Amendment. <em>Id. </em>at 2380-81.</p>\n<p id=\"b1374-14\">Although the Supreme Court ruled that Lane\u2019s speech was protected by the First Amendment, the Court determined that the constitutional question had not been \u201cbeyond debate\u201d when Franks terminated Lane\u2019s employment. <em>Id. </em>at 2383. As a result, Franks was entitled to qualified immunity from the claim made against him in his individual capacity. <em>Id. </em>Accordingly, the Court affirmed the dismissal of Lane\u2019s claim against Franks individu\u00e1lly. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1374-15\">Because we had declined to decide \u2014 and the parties had failed to argue on certiorari review \u2014 -whether Franks (now Burrow) was entitled to sovereign immunity from Lane\u2019s official capacity claim seeking equitable relief,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the Supreme Court remanded the case for further proceedings. <em>Id. </em>We now address the sovereign immunity issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b1374-16\">The district court concluded that Lane\u2019s official-capacity claim against Franks for equitable relief was barred by the Eleventh Amendment. We review the district court\u2019s ruling <em>de novo. See Summit Med. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1351\">*1351</page-number><em>Assocs., P.C. v. Pryor, </em>180 F.3d 1326, 1334 (11th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b1375-5\">Generally speaking, the Eleventh Amendment bars civil actions against state officials in their official capacity \u201cwhen the state is the real, substantial party in interest.\u201d <em>Pennhurst State Sch. &amp; Hosp. v. Halderman, </em>465 U.S. 89, 104 S.Ct. 900, 908, 79 L.Ed.2d 67 (1984). Pursuant to the exception established in <em>Ex parte Young, </em>209 U.S. 123, 28 S.Ct. 441, 52 L.Ed. 714 (1908), official-capacity suits against state officials are permissible, however, under the Eleventh Amendment when the plaintiff seeks <em>\u201cprospective </em>equitable relief to end <em>continuing </em>violations of federal law.\u201d <em>See Summit Med. Assocs., </em>180 F.3d at 1336 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b1375-6\">Here, Lane seeks equitable relief in the form of reinstatement of his employment. We have determined previously that requests for reinstatement constitute prospective injunctive relief that fall within the scope of the <em>Ex parte Young </em>exception and, thus, are not barred by the Eleventh Amendment. <em>See Cross v. Ala. State Dep\u2019t of Mental Health &amp; Mental Retardation, </em>49 F.3d 1490, 1503 (1995); <em>Lassiter v. Ala. A&amp;M Univ., Bd. of Trs., </em>3 F.3d 1482, 1485 (11th Cir.1993), <em>vacated on other grounds, </em>28 F.3d 1146 (11th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b1375-7\">And given our precedents, nothing demonstrates to us that Lane\u2019s requested reinstatement is considerably different, implicating Alabama\u2019s sovereignty interests and funds so significantly that the <em>Ex parte Young </em>exception would be inapplicable. In <em>Idaho v. Coeur d\u2019Alene Tribe, </em>521 U.S. 261, 117 S.Ct. 2028, 138 L.Ed.2d 438 (1997), the Supreme Court concluded that a state was entitled to Eleventh Amendment protection from a suit asserting ownership in certain submerged land and navigable waterways within the state. The Supreme Court noted that the relief sought was \u201cfunctionally] equivalent\u201d to a quiet title action barred by the Eleventh Amendment. <em>Id. </em>at 2040. Moreover, the requested relief would \u201cdiminish, even extinguish, the State\u2019s control [not just state ownership but the power to regulate or affect in any way] over a vast reach of land and waters long deemed by the State to be an integral part of its territory.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Under the \u201cparticular and special circumstances\u201d of the case \u2014 where the state\u2019s sovereign interests \u201cwould be affected in a degree fully as intrusive as almost any conceivable retroactive levy upon funds in its Treasury\u201d \u2014 the state was entitled to Eleventh Amendment protection. <em>Id. </em>at 2043.</p>\n<p id=\"b1375-9\">This case is not like <em>Coeur d\u2019Alene. </em>Here, the special sovereignty interest is lacking: this case does not involve land; Lane\u2019s requested reinstatement is not the \u201cfunctional equivalent\u201d of a form of relief otherwise barred by the Eleventh Amendment. <em>Cf. Summit Med. </em>Assocs., 180 F.3d at 1340-41 (distinguishing <em>Coeur </em>d\u2019Alene).</p>\n<p id=\"b1375-10\">That Lane\u2019s reinstatement would require the State to pay Lane\u2019s salary does not trigger Eleventh Amendment protection. The Supreme Court has recognized that compliance with the terms of prospective injunctive relief will often necessitate the expenditure of state funds. <em>See Edelman v. Jordan, </em>415 U.S. 651, 94 S.Ct. 1347, 1358, 39 L.Ed.2d 662 (1974). And \u201c[s]uch an ancillary effect on the state treasury is a permissible and often an inevitable consequence of the principle announced in <em>Ex parte Young.\u201d Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1375-11\">In the light of our reinstatement precedents, we conclude that the district court erred in dismissing Lane\u2019s official-capacity claim against Franks as barred by the Eleventh Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1375-12\">We affirm in part and vacate in part; and we remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1352\">*1352</page-number>with the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Lane v. Franks, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 134 S.Ct. 2369, 189 L.Ed.2d 312 (2014).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1376-6\">AFFIRMED IN PART; VACATED IN \u2022PART AND REMANDED FOR FURTHER PROCEEDINGS.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1374-11\">. Lane\u2019s claim against Franks in his official capacity is now a claim against Susan Burrow, in her official capacity as CACC\u2019s acting President.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1374-17\">. Lane has abandoned expressly his claim for money damages against Franks in his official capacity. <em>See Lane, </em>523 Fed.Appx. at 710 n. 1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1376-15\">. We acknowledge that the C1I.T.Y. Program for which Lane served as Director is no longer in existence. We are unconvinced that this fact, in and of itself, renders Lane\u2019s request for reinstatement moot, particularly where Lane has alleged that the program was merely reorganized and renamed. But, should the district court determine that a constitutional violation occurred, we suggest that it might be necessary for the district court to engage in additional factfinding on this issue to determine what form of equitable relief is available to Lane.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
