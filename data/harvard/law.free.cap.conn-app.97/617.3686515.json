We reverse the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-9\">The plaintiff allegedly suffered injuries when he slipped and fell on property owned by the housing authority of the town of East Hartford (housing authority) on January 16, 2001. On May 6, 2002, the plaintiff filed a complaint alleging negligence by the housing authority, which was named as the sole defendant. On January 22, 2003, while that action still was pending, the plaintiff filed a seven count complaint in the present action, naming four defendants: Madigan, the executive director of the housing authority; Dumas, the head of maintenance for the housing authority; the town of East Hartford (town); and Billy Taylor, the director of public works for the town. Counts one and three of the plaintiffs complaint alleged negligence by Madigan and Dumas, and counts two and four alleged that they also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>had acted recklessly. Count five related to the town and counts six and seven related to Taylor, but those three counts are not relevant to this appeal.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b643-4\">Madigan and Dumas moved to strike the negligence and recklessness counts directed against them on the basis of the prior pending action doctrine. They also moved to strike the recklessness counts on the ground of failure to state a claim on which relief could be granted. On September 19,2003, the court granted Madi-gan\u2019s and Dumas\u2019 motion to strike the negligence and recklessness counts directed against them. On the order page of the motion, the court wrote: \u201cAs to [the] prior pending action doctrine, only. I have reviewed both [the prior and the present actions], and there is substantial identity of parties and issues. Although the parties and issues appear to be somewhat in flux in the [prior action], efforts have been made to include parties and issues, and the issues should be resolved in [the prior action].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b643-5\">In subsequently articulating its ruling, the court noted that the plaintiff unsuccessfully had moved to cite in Madigan and Dumas as defendants in the prior action, in which the plaintiff had named the housing authority as the only defendant. Because Madigan and Dumas were employees of the housing authority, the court explained that the housing authority would be liable for Madigan\u2019s and Dumas\u2019 negligent conduct within the scope of their employment, and, therefore, \u201cthere appeared to be functional identity of parties and issues\u201d in the prior and present actions. As to the allegations of recklessness, however, the court wrote: \u201cAt some point in the proceedings, the plaintiff argued that the [present] action against Madigan and Dumas should continue because they might be individually liable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>because of activity outside of the scope of employment. If indeed there could be liability not encompassed by the [housing] authority\u2019s liability, that position has considerable merit. My memory, however, is that there was never an explanation of how [Madigan and Dumas] reasonably could be liable if the [housing] authority were not liable, and the assertion was not persuasive.\u201d The court granted Madigan\u2019s and Dumas\u2019 motion for judgment on December 10, 2003. This appeal followed.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b644-4\">We first set forth the law regarding the prior pending action doctrine because the court granted Madigan\u2019s and Dumas\u2019 motion to strike on the basis of that doctrine. \u201cThe prior pending action doctrine permits the court to dismiss a second case that raises issues currently pending before the court. The pendency of a prior suit of the same character, between the same parties, brought to obtain the same end or object, is, at common law, good cause for abatement. It is so, because there cannot be any reason or necessity for bringing the second, and, therefore, it must be oppressive and vexatious. This is a rule of justice and equity, generally <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>applicable, and always, where the two suits are virtually alike, and in the same jurisdiction. . . . We must examine the pleadings to ascertain whether the actions are virtually alike . . . and whether they are brought to adjudicate the same underlying rights.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Sandvig </em>v. <em>A. Debreuil &amp; Sons, Inc., </em>53 Conn. App. 466, 469, 730 A.2d 646, cert. denied, 250 Conn. 920, 738 A.2d 659 (1999). \u201cAny claim that the pendency of a prior suit between the same parties, for the same thing, will abate a latter suit . . . formerly could be raised by a plea in abatement. . . . The plea in abatement . . . has, however, since been replaced by the motion to dismiss.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Halpern </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>196 Conn. 647, 652 n.4, 495 A.2d 264 (1985). \u201cThe prior pending action doctrine is properly raised via a motion to dismiss . . . .\u201d <em>In re Jessica M., </em>71 Conn. App. 417, 427, 802 A.2d 197 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b645-5\">In the present case, Madigan and Dumas raised the prior pending action doctrine by way of a motion to strike. As we have indicated, the function of the motion to dismiss is different from that of the motion to strike. \u201c[The motion to dismiss] essentially asserts that, as a matter of law and fact, a plaintiff cannot state a cause of action that is properly before the court. . . . [S]ee Practice Book \u00a7 10-31. By contrast, the motion to strike attacks the sufficiency of the pleadings. Practice Book \u00a7 10-39 .... There is a significant difference between asserting that a plaintiff cannot state a cause of action and asserting that a plaintiff has not stated a cause of action, and therein lies the distinction between the motion to dismiss and the motion to strike.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Egri </em>v. <em>Foisie, </em>83 Conn. App. 243, 247, 848 A.2d 1266, cert. denied, 271 Conn. 931, 859 A.2d 930 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b645-6\">With respect to counts one and three of the plaintiffs complaint, which alleged negligence by Madigan and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>Dumas, the court should have treated the motion to strike as a motion to dismiss because the prior pending action doctrine properly is raised via a motion to dismiss. The court nonetheless applied the correct standard in examining the pleadings to determine whether the prior and the present actions are virtually alike and were brought to adjudicate the same underlying rights. On the basis of our review of the pleadings, we conclude that the court properly determined that the prior pending action doctrine applies to the negligence counts directed against Madigan and Dumas.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Rather than striking those counts, however, the court should have dismissed them. We therefore must remand the case with direction to dismiss counts one and three of the plaintiff\u2019s complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-5\">Counts two and four of the plaintiffs complaint, which alleged recklessness by Madigan and Dumas, were not subject to dismissal pursuant to the prior pending action doctrine because there was no mention of recklessness in the plaintiffs complaint in the prior action.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Instead, the recklessness counts were subject <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>to a motion to strike on Madigan\u2019s and Dumas\u2019 alternate ground of failure to state a claim on which relief could be granted. As the order page of the motion to strike indicates, the court did not consider that ground. The court ruled on the negligence and recklessness counts only on the basis of the prior pending action doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-4\">In its subsequent articulation, the court inconsistently explained that it had stricken the recklessness counts because \u201cthere was never an explanation of how [Madigan and Dumas] reasonably could be liable if the [housing] authority were not liable, and the assertion was not persuasive.\u201d The articulation suggests that the recklessness counts were legally insufficient because the plaintiff failed to allege enough facts to support them. The legal sufficiency of the pleadings is indeed the proper focus in ruling on a motion to strike. We must recognize, however, that \u201c [t]he purpose of an articulation is to dispel any . . . ambiguity by clarifying the factual and legal basis upon which the trial court rendered its decision, thereby sharpening the issues on appeal. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b647-5\">\u201cAn articulation is not an opportunity for a trial court to substitute a new decision nor to change the reasoning or basis of a prior decision. ... [A] trial court may not alter its initial findings by way of a further articulation . . . .\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Fantasia </em>v. <em>Milford Fastening Systems, </em>86 Conn. App. 270, 283-84, 860 A.2d 779 (2004), cert. denied, 272 Conn. 919, 866 A.2d 1286 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b647-6\">Although the court may have been correct in its articulation that the recklessness counts against Madigan and Dumas were legally insufficient, the court already ruled improperly that those counts were to be stricken pursuant to the prior pending action doctrine. We therefore must remand the case for further proceedings on counts two and four of the plaintiffs complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>The form of the judgment is improper as to counts one and three of the plaintiffs complaint, the judgment is reversed and the case is remanded with direction to dismiss those counts and for further proceedings on counts two and four consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-6\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b642-10\"> The other defendants in this case, the town of East Hartford and Billy Taylor, are not parties to this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b643-6\"> The court granted the motion for summary judgment filed by the town and Taylor as to the counts directed against them.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b644-5\"> The plaintiff twice amended his complaint in the present action, first on October 20, 2003, and then again on December 2, 2003. Notably, the two amended complaints appear to be identical to the original complaint. The court sustained Madigan\u2019s and Dumas\u2019 objection to the first amended complaint because the plaintiff did not file it within fifteen days after the granting of the motion to strike pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 10-44. Although Madigan and Dumas also objected to the second amended complaint as untimely, the court did not rule on that objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-6\">The filing of an amended complaint ordinarily constitutes a waiver of the right to appeal from the granting of a motion to strike the original pleading. See <em>Bross </em>v. <em>Hillside Acres, Inc., </em>92 Conn. App. 773, 777-78, 887 A.2d 420 (2006). Because the court sustained Madigan\u2019s and Dumas\u2019 objection to the first amended complaint, however, the original complaint remained the operative pleading, and the plaintiff retained his right to challenge the court\u2019s ruling on the motion to strike. We are not particularly troubled by the lack of a ruling on Madigan\u2019s and Dumas\u2019 objection to the second amended complaint because that complaint was untimely and did not differ from the first amended complaint and the original complaint. The plaintiffs purpose in filing the second amended complaint eludes us, as does the reason for the plaintiffs failure to make any amendments in his two amended complaints.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b646-6\"> The prior action alleged negligence by the housing authority. Counts one and three of the plaintiffs complaint in the present action alleged negligence by Madigan and Dumas, employees of the housing authority. The two actions are virtually alike and were brought to adjudicate the same underlying rights because General Statutes \u00a7 8-41a provides that \u201c[e]ach housing authority shall protect and save harmless any commissioner or any full-time employee of such authority from financial loss and expense, including legal fees and costs, if any, arising out of any claim, demand, suit or judgment by reason of alleged negligence, or for alleged infringement of any person\u2019s civil rights, on the part of such commissioner or such employee while acting in the discharge of his duties.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b646-8\"> Allegations of recklessness differ from allegations of negligence because \u201creckless conduct tends to take on the aspect of highly unreasonable conduct, involving an extreme departure from ordinary care, in a situation where a high degree of danger is apparent. . . . [S]uch aggravated negligence must be more than any mere mistake resulting from inexperience, excitement, or confusion, and more than mere thoughtlessness or inadvertence, or simply inattention.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Craig </em>v. <em>Driscoll, </em>262 Conn. 312, 343, 813 A.2d 1003 (2003).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
