Quint, appeals from the judgments of conviction, rendered after a jury trial, of three counts of criminal violation of a protective order, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 53a-223 (a), and three counts of criminal trespass in the first degree, in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-107 (a) (2). On appeal, the defendant claims that (1) his convictions violated his constitutional protection against double jeopardy, and (2) he was denied his right to a fair trial as a result of prosecutorial misconduct during trial and closing arguments.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We disagree and affirm the judgments of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-8\">The jury reasonably could have found the following facts. In February, 2002, the defendant began dating and living with the victim, Francine Casey, in Milford. On July 9,2002, following a domestic dispute, the defendant called the Milford police to the couple\u2019s residence, and both the defendant and the victim were arrested. After the arrest, the victim requested that a full no contact protective order be issued against the defendant. The court granted the request, and a full no contact <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>protective order was issued,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> which provided in relevant part: \u201cThat the defendant refrain from threatening [the victim] . . . entering her dwelling or the dwelling occupied by the victim. That he may return one time with a police escort to retrieve his personal belongings. That he refrain from having any contact in any manner with the victim. That he refrain from coming within one hundred yards from the victim . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b99-6\">At approximately 9:55 p.m. on July 22, 2002, Officer Andrew Dunaj of the Milford police department was dispatched to the residence of the victim after the Milford police received a call from the victim\u2019s brother alleging that the defendant had violated the protective order. When Dunaj arrived, the victim informed him that the defendant had violated the protective order two times that day. The victim reported that at approximately 3 a.m., the defendant entered her residence intoxicated, instigated a verbal exchange, stole her purse and threatened her with bodily injury if she contacted the police. She stated that she did not report the violation of the protective order because she feared the defendant would retaliate against her. She also stated that at approximately 6:44 p.m., on the same day, the defendant attempted to enter the residence through a window, which was blocked by an air conditioner. The victim told Dunaj that the defendant had returned to the residence to give her back her purse but left once he heard the police were en route to the residence. She told Dunaj that although she did not want the defendant arrested, she did want to create a record of his violations of the protective order \u201cin case anything happened.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b99-7\">On July 27, 2002, Dunaj contacted the defendant to inquire about the incident on July 22. According to Dunaj, the defendant admitted that he had entered the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>victim\u2019s residence early in the morning on July 22, but he insisted that he was invited to the residence by the victim. The defendant, however, denied threatening the victim or returning to the residence later that day. Dunaj recalled reminding the defendant of the conditions of the protective order and informing him that when he entered the residence of the victim on July 22, he violated the protective order.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-6\">Then, on August 20,2002, Dunaj again was dispatched to the residence of the victim. When Dunaj arrived, the victim informed him that, on that day, the defendant had returned to her residence without a police escort, this time seeking to retrieve his personal belongings. She stated that the defendant did not enter the residence, but rather was in her driveway and attempted to enter the dwelling through a window. The victim\u2019s brother, who was at the residence during the relevant time period, opined that the defendant tried to enter the dwelling through a window. The victim also claimed that the defendant had instigated a verbal argument with her and left only when she informed him that she had called the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-7\">Later that day, Dunaj located and arrested the defendant. The defendant was charged with one count of threatening in the second degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-62 (a) (1) in connection with the incident that occurred at 3 a.m. on July 22, 2002, as well as three counts of criminal trespass in the first degree and three counts of criminal violation of a protective order for the incidents that occurred on July 22 and August 20, 2002. Following a jury trial, the defendant was acquitted of the threatening charge but convicted of three counts of criminal trespass in the first degree and three counts of criminal violation of a protective order. Additional facts will be set forth where necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">First, the defendant claims that his prosecution and convictions under both \u00a7 53a-223 (a) and \u00a7 53a-107 (a) (2)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> violated his constitutional protection against double jeopardy under the fifth amendment to the United States constitution and article first, \u00a7 9, of the constitution of Connecticut. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-7\">The defendant concedes that he failed to preserve his claim that his convictions violated the principles of double jeopardy and seeks to prevail under <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>213 Conn. 233, 239-40, 567 A.2d 823 (1989). We will review the defendant\u2019s claim because the record is adequate for our review, and the claim is of a constitutional nature. The defendant cannot prevail, however, because the alleged constitutional violation clearly did not exist, and he clearly was not deprived of a fair trial. See id.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-8\">\u201cThe double jeopardy clause of the fifth amendment to the United States constitution provides: \u2018[N]or shall any person be subject for the same offense to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb.\u2019 The double jeopardy clause is applicable to the states through the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment. . . . This constitutional guarantee prohibits not only multiple trials for the same offense, but also multiple punishments <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>for the same offense in a single trial.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Greco, </em>216 Conn. 282, 289-90, 579 A.2d 84 (1990). One may, however, when the legislature authorizes, be convicted of multiple offenses even though the offenses arise from the same conduct. <em>Missouri </em>v. <em>Hunter, </em>459 U.S. 359, 367-68, 103 S. Ct. 673, 74 L. Ed. 2d 535 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b102-6\">Here, the defendant claims that he was punished multiple times for the same offense. That is to say, he alleges that his prosecutions and convictions under \u00a7 53a-223 (a) for the crime of violating a protective order and under \u00a7 53a-107 (a) (2) for the crime of criminal trespass in the first degree constituted double jeopardy because the statutes criminalize the same conduct. \u201cIn this context, double jeopardy protection is limited to assuring that the court does not exceed its legislative authorization by imposing multiple punishments for the same offense.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Smart, </em>37 Conn. App. 360, 365, 656 A.2d 677, cert. denied, 233 Conn. 914, 659 A.2d 187 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b102-7\">\u201cDouble jeopardy analysis in the context of a single trial is a two-step process. First, the charges must arise out of the same act or transaction. Second, it must be determined whether the charged crimes are the same offense. Multiple punishments are forbidden only if both conditions are met.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) State v. <em>Greco, </em>supra, 216 Conn. 290-91. While the first prong requires a review of the bill of particulars, the second prong requires the application of the test set forth in <em>Blockburger </em>v. <em>United States, </em>284 U.S. 299, 52 S. Ct. 180, 76 L. Ed. 306 (1932), \u201cto determine whether two statutes criminalize the same offense, thus placing a defendant prosecuted under both statutes in double jeopardy [and] the test to be applied to determine whether there are two offenses or only one, is whether each provision requires proof of a fact which the other does not. . . . This test is a technical one and examines <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>only the statutes, charging instruments, and bill of particulars as opposed to the evidence presented at trial.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Lopez, </em>93 Conn. App. 257, 272, 889 A.2d 254, cert. granted on other grounds, 277 Conn. 919, 895 A.2d 791 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">As the <em>Blockburger </em>test is only a rule of statutory construction and \u201cselves as a means of discerning [legislative] purpose the rule should not be controlling where, for example, there is a clear indication of contrary legislative intent.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id.; see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Greco, </em>supra, 216 Conn. 292.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-7\">Thus, the <em>Blockburger </em>test, as a rule of statutory construction, simply creates a rebuttable \u201cpresumption as to the actual legislative intent, [and] it is not a blind presumption that may be applied without regard to other relevant evidence of true intent. It would be absurd indeed to apply <em>Blockburger, </em>which was meant to help determine legislative intent, in a way that actually defeats what reason and logic dictate to be the intent.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Delgado, </em>19 Conn. App. 245, 252, 562 A.2d 539 (1989). The United States Supreme Court and our Supreme Court have made clear that the <em>Blockburger </em>\u201crule should not be controlling where, for example, there is a clear indication of contrary legislative intent [and] [t]he language, structure and legislative history of a statute can provide evidence of this intent.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Greco, </em>supra, 216 Conn. 293. \u201cStatutory construction is a matter of law over which we exercise plenary review.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Lopez, </em>supra, 93 Conn. App. 272.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-8\">In the present case, the parties do not dispute that the charged offenses of criminal trespass in the first degree and violation of a protective order arose from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>the same acts.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Furthermore, the state concedes, as it must, that criminal trespass in the first degree in violation of \u00a7 53a-107 (a) (2) and violation of a protective order pursuant to \u00a7 53a-223 (a) constitute the same offense under the <em>Blockburger </em>test.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Thus, the determinative question is whether there is any clear indication of legislative intent to the contrary. We answer that question in the affirmative.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-6\">On the basis of our examination of the language, structure and legislative history of \u00a7\u00a7 53a-107 (a) (2) and 53a-223 (a), we conclude that the legislature intended multiple punishments for the offense of trespassing in violation of a protective order. In reaching this conclusion, we first look to the explicit language of \u00a7\u00a7 53a-107 (a) (2) and 53a-223 (a) and note that neither statute contains language barring multiple punishments for the same offense. We have held that because \u201cthe legislature has shown that it knows how to bar multiple punishments expressly when it does not intend such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>punishment . . . the absence of similar language in those statutes provides evidence that the legislature intended cumulative punishments.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Servello, </em>80 Conn. App. 313, 323, 835 A.2d 102 (2003), cert. denied, 267 Conn. 914, 841 A.2d 220 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b105-6\">Indeed, \u00a7 53a-223 was created by Public Acts 1991, No. 91-381, \u201cAn Act Concerning Family Violence,\u201d the same act that amended \u00a7 53a-107 by expanding \u00a7 53a-107 (a) (2) to provide a criminal penalty for those who trespass in violation of a protective order issued pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 46b-15 or General Statutes \u00a7 46b-38c. In addition, both \u00a7 53a-223 and \u00a7 53a-107 were subsequently amended by Public Acts 1995, No. 95-214, \u201cAn Act Concerning Stalking,\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and Public Acts 1999, No. 99-240, \u201cAn Act Concerning Witness Protection, Cash Bail, Bail Enforcement Agents and Health Insurance for Survivors of Police Officers and Constables.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Thus, it is clear that the legislature was aware of these two criminal statutes and, while having the opportunity to bar multiple punishments under these statutes, did not add language to these statutes evincing such an intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-7\">Additional evidence of the legislature\u2019s intent to provide for cumulative punishments is that the statutes set forth separate penalties \u201crather than using a multiplier of a penalty established for another offense.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Delgado, </em>supra, 19 Conn. App. 255. In <em>Delgado, </em>we found evidence of legislative intent to provide cumulative punishments when the statutes in question did not make <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>reference to each other and instead set forth their own penalty. Id. Similarly, in this instance, neither \u00a7 53a-107 (a) (2) nor \u00a7 53a-223 (a) make reference to each other, and while a violation of \u00a7 53a-107 (a) (2) is a class A misdemeanor, a violation of \u00a7 53a-223 (a) is a class D felony.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-6\">Finally, our conclusion that the legislature intended cumulative punishments is based on the fact that the interests protected by the statutes are distinguishable. As our Supreme Court noted in <em>State v. Greco, </em>supra, 216 Conn. 282, \u201c[t]he United States Supreme Court found support for its conclusion that Congress intended multiple punishment for violations of two conspiracy statutes in the fact that the statutes were directed to separate evils presented by drug trafficking, namely importation and distribution.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 295; see <em>State </em>v. <em>Braswell, </em>42 Conn. App. 264, 270, 679 A.2d 407 (1996), appeal dismissed, 243 Conn. 248, 701 A.2d 1057 (1997). Here, the obvious purpose of \u00a7 53a-223 (a) is to aid the enforcement of protective orders and to protect victims from injury or intimidation. See Public Acts 1991, No. 91-381; Office of Legislative Research Bill Analysis for Public Acts 1991, No. 91-381. Conversely, \u00a7 53a-107 (a) (2) was enacted to protect landowners or occupiers \u201cfrom intrusions by unwanted persons.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Delgado, </em>supra, 19 Conn. App. 254.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b107-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>As the defendant\u2019s prosecutions and convictions pursuant to \u00a7 53a-107 (a) (2) and \u00a7 53a-223 (a) were consistent with the legislature\u2019s intent to provide cumulative punishments for the single act of trespass in violation of a protective order, we hold that the defendant has not established that a constitutional violation clearly exists and clearly deprived him of a fair trial. Thus, his claim must fail under the third prong of <em>Golding.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b107-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b107-7\">Finally, the defendant claims that he was denied his right to a fair trial as a result of prosecutorial misconduct during trial and closing arguments. Specifically, the defendant claims that the prosecutor improperly (1) asked the defendant to comment on the veracity of other witnesses, and (2) vouched for the credibility of the state\u2019s witnesses and expressed his personal opinion.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-8\">We begin by setting forth the applicable standard of review. Although, the defendant did not object to any of the alleged misconduct challenged on appeal, he maintains that he is entitled to a new trial on the ground that the alleged misconduct deprived him of a fair trial. \u201cWe review unpreserved claims of prosecutorial misconduct by applying the factors set out in <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>204 Conn. 523, 540, 529 A.2d 653 (1987). . . . [I]n analyzing claims of prosecutorial misconduct, we engage in a two step analytical process. The two steps are separate and distinct: (1) whether misconduct occurred in the first instance; and (2) whether that misconduct deprived a defendant of his due process <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>right to a fair trial. Put differently, misconduct is misconduct, regardless of its ultimate effect on the fairness of the trial; whether that misconduct caused or contributed to a due process violation is a separate and distinct question ....</p>\n<p id=\"b108-6\">\u201cOnly if we conclude that prosecutorial misconduct has occurred do we then determine whether the defendant was deprived of his due process right to a fair trial. In doing so, we must determine whether the sum total of [the prosecutor\u2019s] improprieties rendered the defendant\u2019s [trial] fundamentally unfair, in violation of his right to due process. . . . The question of whether the defendant has been prejudiced by prosecutorial misconduct, therefore, depends on whether there is a reasonable likelihood that the jury\u2019s verdict would have been different absent the sum total of the improprieties. . . . This inquiry is guided by an examination of the following <em>Williams </em>factors: the extent to which the misconduct was invited by defense conduct or argument . . . the severity of the misconduct . . . the frequency of the misconduct . . . the centrality of the misconduct to the critical issues in the case . . . the strength of the curative measures adopted . . . and the strength of the state\u2019s case.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>McCleese, </em>94 Conn. App. 510, 516-17, 892 A.2d 343, cert. denied, 278 Conn. 908, 899 A.2d 36 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b108-8\">\u201c[I]t is not the prosecutor\u2019s conduct alone that guides our inquiry, but, rather, the fairness of the trial as a whole. . . . We are mindful throughout this inquiry, however, of the unique responsibilities of the prosecutor in our judicial system. A prosecutor is not only an officer of the court, like every other attorney, but is also a high public officer, representing the people of the State, who seek impartial justice for the guilty as much as for the innocent. ... By reason of his [or her] office, [the prosecutor] usually exercises great <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>influence upon jurors. [The prosecutor\u2019s] conduct and language in the trial of cases in which human life or liberty are at stake should be forceful, but fair, because he [or she] represents the public interest, which demands no victim and asks no conviction through the aid of passion, prejudice or resentment. If the accused be guilty, he [or she] should none the less be convicted only after a fair trial, conducted strictly according to the sound and well-established rules which the laws prescribe.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Boyd, </em>89 Conn. App. 1, 29, 872 A.2d 477, cert. denied, 275 Conn. 921, 883 A.2d 1247 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b109-6\">As it relates to prosecutorial misconduct during closing arguments, we have held that \u201c[i]n determining whether such misconduct has occurred, the reviewing court must give due deference to the fact that [c]ounsel must be allowed a generous latitude in argument, as the limits of legitimate argument and fair comment cannot be determined precisely by rule and line, and something must be allowed for the zeal of counsel in the heat of argument. . . . Thus, as the state\u2019s advocate, a prosecutor may argue the state\u2019s case forcefully, [provided the argument is] fair and based upon the facts in evidence and the reasonable inferences to be drawn therefrom. . . . Moreover, [i]t does not follow . . . that every use of rhetorical language or device [by the prosecutor] is improper. . . . The occasional use of rhetorical devices is simply fair argument. . . . Nevertheless, the prosecutor has a heightened duty to avoid argument that strays from the evidence or diverts the jury\u2019s attention from the facts of the case. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b109-7\">\u201cIn examining the prosecutor\u2019s argument we must distinguish between those comments whose effects may be removed by appropriate instructions . . . and those which are flagrant and therefore deny the accused a fair trial. . . . Last, we note that [w]e do not scrutinize each individual comment in a vacuum, but rather <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>we must review the comments complained of in the context of the entire trial. ... It is in that context that the burden [falls] on the defendant to demonstrate that the remarks were so prejudicial that he was deprived of a fair trial and the entire proceedings were tainted.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 29-30. With those basic tenets in mind, we now turn to the defendant\u2019s claims on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b110-7\">First, the defendant claims that the prosecutor improperly asked the defendant to comment on the veracity of other witnesses and that the prosecutor continued this improper conduct by emphasizing the defendant\u2019s testimony during closing arguments. We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-8\">The following additional facts are necessary for the resolution of that issue. It will suffice to say that the evidence at trial distilled to a credibility contest between the defendant and the state\u2019s witnesses due to the nature of the charged offenses and the conflicting testimony of the witnesses. In this regard, the state\u2019s key witness was the victim, who testified that the defendant violated the protective order and trespassed twice on July 22 and once on August 20,2002. Although the victim and the victim\u2019s brother were both present when the defendant violated the protective order on August 20, only the victim was present when the defendant committed two violations of the protective order on July 22. Indeed, as to the July 22 incidents, the testimony of Dunaj and the victim\u2019s brother was based on representations made to them and not on their personal observations.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-9\">During the defendant\u2019s case-in-chief, defense counsel asked the defendant if on July 22 he violated the protective order by either entering the victim\u2019s dwelling, having any contact with the victim or threatening, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>harassing, assaulting, molesting or sexually assaulting the victim. When the defendant replied, \u201cNo, I did not,\u201d the following exchange occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b111-6\">\u201cQ. You are telling this jury and the court that [the victim] is lying?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b111-7\">\u201cA. Yes, I am.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b111-8\">On cross-examination of the defendant, the prosecutor adopted this line of questioning, begun by defense counsel, and delved into the subject of the veracity of all of the state\u2019s witnesses. The defendant was asked the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b111-9\">\u201cQ. Do you believe [the victim\u2019s] testimony is fabricated?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b111-10\">\u201cA. Yes, I do.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b111-11\">\u201cQ. And we are to believe you that you weren\u2019t there?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b111-12\">\u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b111-13\">\u201cQ. Did you hear Officer Dunaj testify that he had a phone conversation with you . . . [and] that you admitted going on the property . . . ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b111-14\">\u201cA. As I already said.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b111-15\">\u201cQ. So, he\u2019s lying, too.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b111-16\">\u201cA. That\u2019s not what I told him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b111-17\">\u201cQ. So, is it your testimony that [the victim] and Mr.\u2014 Officer Dunaj are both lying to this jury?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b111-18\">\u201cA. Well, Mr. Dunaj must be, and [the victim] definitely is.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b111-19\">\u201cQ. Okay.

That is so because such questions not only invade the province of the jury, in that determinations of credibility are for the jury to decide, but those questions also have no probative value because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>they are not helpful to the jury in assessing a witness\u2019 credibility. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b113-4\">Nevertheless, \u201c[a]s a general rule ... if a party delves into a particular subject during examination, he is said to have opened the door for further examination regarding that subject. . . . Once that door was opened, the prosecutor had the right to inquire into the defendant\u2019s statement and ask whether all the witnesses in the case were lying.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Sells, </em>82 Conn. App. 332, 338, 844 A.2d 235, cert. denied, 270 Conn. 911, 853 A.2d 529 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">Indeed, we have reached the same conclusion on facts analogous to those in this case. In <em>Sells, </em>we held that when defense counsel, on direct examination, asked the defendant to comment on the veracity of the state\u2019s witnesses, thus opening the door on the subject of the credibility of the state\u2019s witnesses, the prosecutor \u201chad a right to inquire into the defendant\u2019s statements and ask whether all the witnesses in the case were lying.\u201d Id. Thus, the prosecutor, in this case, did not commit misconduct in cross-examining the defendant on the issue of the credibility of all of the state\u2019s witnesses, and it was not improper for the prosecutor to emphasize the defendant\u2019s testimony in closing argument.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b114-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>B</p>\n<p id=\"b114-6\">Next, the defendant claims that the prosecutor, during the trial and in closing argument, improperly vouched for the credibility of the state\u2019s witnesses and expressed his personal opinion, consequently depriving the defendant of a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-7\">1</p>\n<p id=\"b114-8\">We first address the defendant\u2019s claim that the prosecutor improperly expressed his personal opinion during the trial. In particular, the defendant points out that on cross-examination, the prosecutor repeatedly asked the defendant if he was telling the truth, if he was perjuring himself and if he understood the penalty for perjury. Although defense counsel raised no objection to this line of questioning at trial, the defendant claims on appeal that these questions constituted impermissible statements of personal opinion. The state argues in response that the prosecutor\u2019s questions were not improper cross-examination because \u201c[o]nce the defendant decided to testify, he opened himself up to legitimate probing questions testing his credibility.\u201d We agree with the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-9\">It is axiomatic that when a defendant chooses to testify, he puts his credibility at issue, and the state is free to \u201cchallenge the defendant\u2019s version of the facts and to argue that the defendant had tailored his testimony to fit the state\u2019s case, provided that such an argument [is] linked solely to the evidence and not, either directly or indirectly, to the defendant\u2019s presence at trial [i.e., his exercise of a constitutional right].\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Alexander, </em>50 Conn. App. 242, 250, 718 A.2d 66 (1998), rev\u2019d in part on other grounds, 254 Conn. 290, 755 A.2d 868 (2000). Thus, we conclude, the prosecutor\u2019s questions during cross-examination were not an expression of his personal opinion and, thus, did not constitute misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>2</p>\n<p id=\"b115-6\">Next, the defendant argues that during closing arguments, the prosecutor improperly expressed his personal opinion. The record reveals that during summation, the prosecutor stressed that the defendant\u2019s testimony was inconsistent with the testimony of all of the state\u2019s witnesses, and that the state\u2019s witnesses were telling the truth and that only the defendant had a reason to fabricate his testimony.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Defense counsel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>did not object to the prosecutor\u2019s comments during closing argument. Instead, defense counsel adopted the same method of argument and offered his personal opinion as to the credibility of the witnesses.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b116-6\">Although the state concedes that the prosecutor, during closing argument, improperly expressed his personal opinion, the state maintains that the misconduct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>did not deprive the defendant of a fair trial. We agree with the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-6\">Even if we assume arguendo that the prosecutor\u2019s remarks were an improper expression of his personal opinion, we next must determine whether the defendant was deprived of his due process right to a fair trial. \u201cAs we have stated, our inquiry into whether the defendant has been prejudiced by prosecutorial misconduct is guided by an examination of the <em>Williams </em>factors: the extent to which the misconduct was invited by defense conduct or argument . . . the severity of the misconduct . . . the frequency of the misconduct . . . the centrality of the misconduct to the critical issues in the case . . . the strength of the curative measures adopted . . . and the strength of the state\u2019s case.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>McCleese, </em>supra, 94 Conn. App. 520-21.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-7\">The state concedes that the prosecutor\u2019s comments on the credibility of the witnesses were not invited by defense counsel\u2019s conduct or argument. The state also acknowledges that credibility was a critical issue in this case and that there was no incriminating physical evidence. As our Supreme Court has stated, cases that are lacking conclusive physical evidence and hinge on the jury\u2019s determination of the credibility of the victim are not particularly strong cases. <em>State </em>v. <em>Ceballos, </em>266 Conn. 364, 416-17, 832 A.2d 14 (2003); <em>State </em>v. <em>Singh, </em>259 Conn. 693, 724-25, 793 A.2d 226 (2002); see <em>State </em>v. <em>Singleton, </em>95 Conn. App. 492, 503, 897 A.2d 636, cert. denied, 279 Conn. 904, 901 A.2d 1228 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b117-8\">The misconduct in this case, however, was neither frequent nor severe because it was confined to only a portion of the closing argument. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Pouncey, </em>40 Conn. App. 624, 636, 673 A.2d 547 (1996), aff'd, 241 Conn. 802, 699 A.2d 901 (1997). Although the court did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>not issue any specific curative instruction, its preliminary and final instructions to the jury likely cured the misconduct, as it reminded the jury that it \u201calone deter-min\u00e9is] the weight, the effect, the value of the evidence, as well as the credibility and believability of the witnesses.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Although \u201ca general instruction does not have the same curative effect as a charge directed at a specific impropriety, particularly when the misconduct has been more than an isolated occurrence . . . [where] [t]he defendant fail[s] ... to object to this comment ... to bring [the improper comment] to the attention <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>of the trial court, [the defendant] bear s much of the responsibility for the fact that [this] claimed impropriet[y] went uncured.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) St<em>ate </em>v. <em>Warholic, </em>278 Conn. 354, 401-402, 897 A.2d 569 (2006). Indeed, we have repeatedly stated that \u201cdefense counsel\u2019s failure to object to the prosecutor\u2019s argument when it was made suggests that defense counsel [may not have] believe [d] that it was unfair in light of the record of the case at the time.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 402. Additionally, of note is the fact that the jury found the defendant not guilty of the threatening charge, which indicates that the jury\u2019s deliberations were not overborne by the prosecutor\u2019s improper opinions as to the credibility of witnesses. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Doriss, </em>84 Conn. App. 542, 548, 854 A.2d 48, cert. denied, 271 Conn. 922, 859 A.2d 581 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b119-6\">Thus, even if we were to conclude that the prosecutor\u2019s comments during closing arguments were improper, the defendant was not prejudiced by the misconduct and was not deprived of his right to a fair trial. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Warholic, </em>supra, 278 Conn. 400-404.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-7\">The judgments are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-8\">In this opinion DUPONT, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b98-9\"> The defendant also claims that the prosecutor referred to facts that were not in evidence. Specifically, the defendant claims that during closing arguments, in regard to the charge that the defendant threatened the victim, the prosecutor stated that the defendant \u201cthreatened [the victim] with bodily harm, to have one of his \u2014 her fate would be worse than death after he contacted his motorcycle gang.\u201d The state concedes that because this fact was never introduced at trial, it was improper for the prosecutor to refer to it in his closing argument. The defendant, however, was not prejudiced by this statement because he was acquitted of the charge of threatening in the second degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-62 (a) (1). Additionally, we find no support for the defendant\u2019s assertion that but for this remark, the jury would have found the defendant not guilty of the remaining counts.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b99-8\"> The protective order was issued on July 9, 2002, the same day that the victim and the defendant were arrested.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b101-9\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-223 (a) provides in relevant part that a \u201cperson is guilty of criminal violation of a protective order when an order issued pursuant to subsection (e) of section 46b-38c, or section 54-lk or 54-82r has been issued against such person, and such person violates such order.\u201d In this instance, the protective order prohibited the defendant from, among other things, (1) entering the dwelling of the victim, (2) returning to the dwelling without a police escort, (3) having any contact in any manner with the victim, (4) coming within 100 yards of the victim <em>and (5) </em>stalking the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-10\">General Statutes \u00a7 53a-107 (a) (2), criminal trespass in the first degree, makes it a crime when a person \u201centers or remains in a building or any other premises in violation of a restraining order issued pursuant to section 46b-15 or a protective order issued pursuant to sections 46b-38c, 54-lk or 54-82r by the Superior Court . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b104-7\"> We note that, as the state has pointed out, in theory, there would be no double jeopardy issue if the charging instrument had provided that the defendant was charged with criminal trespass in the first degree pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 53a-223 (a) for entering the victim\u2019s dwelling in violation of the protective order and under General Statutes \u00a7 53a-107 (a) (2) for his violation of the protective order by coming within 100 yards of the victim, returning to the victim\u2019s dwelling without a police escort and having contact with the victim. In such a case, the charges and the subsequent conviction would not be for the same offense. Nonetheless, the charging instrument, in this case, did not specify the particular acts for which the defendant was charged, and therefore \u201cwe resolve the ambiguity in the defendant\u2019s favor\u201d; <em>State </em>v. <em>Mincewicz, </em>64 Conn.

Who has the most interest in the outcome of the trial? Of the five witnesses in this case, only one is charged with seven violations of the Connecticut General Statutes. [The defendant] has the motive to fabricate. [The defendant] is the answer to all these questions.

Why would [the victim] make up this whole story and subject herself to perjury for the charge of issuing a false statement? She\u2019s not. She is here in court.

Although I agree with the majority on the resolution of the double jeopardy claim, I respectfully disagree on the disposition of the claim of prosecutorial misconduct. Because I believe that prosecutorial misconduct of a classic nature occurred during both cross-examination and closing argument, and deprived the defendant, Richard R. Quint, of a fair trial in this case, which hinged on the credibility of witnesses, I would reverse the convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-10\">Prosecutorial misconduct claims are addressed frequently by this court and by our Supreme Court. It is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>useful, as the majority has done, to review the relevant standards of review and principles of law as established by our Supreme Court. Even when those standards and principles are accurately interpreted and precisely applied, however, because they are fact specific, they may appear to produce inconsistent results. When the prosecutorial misconduct cases decided by the Supreme Court and this court are assessed together, it may be difficult to identify actions that will consistently be deemed misconduct and to define precisely the pattern of misconduct that will be deemed to deprive a defendant of the right to a fair trial.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> A review of several pivotal cases of our Supreme Court, however, provides guidance as to the prevailing standards and the method for analyzing prosecutorial misconduct claims.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b120-6\">In the present case, the majority concludes that the prosecutor did not engage in misconduct by cross-examining the defendant on the veracity of the state\u2019s witnesses and subsequently emphasizing that testimony during closing argument. In addition, the majority concludes that the prosecutor\u2019s expressions of personal opinion during cross-examination were not misconduct and merely assumes arguendo that the prosecutor engaged in misconduct by expressing his personal opinion during closing argument. I believe that each of these instances constituted misconduct and that the defendant was deprived of his right to a fair trial. Furthermore, I suggest that the majority\u2019s determination that the prosecutor did not engage in misconduct by cross-examining the defendant on the veracity of the state\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>witnesses and emphasizing that testimony during closing argument resulted from a misapplication of the prevailing method of analysis. In short, that determination was made by taking into account, in the first step of the analysis, a <em>Williams </em>factor; see <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>204 Conn. 523, 529 A.2d 653 (1987); that applies only to the second step of the analysis, that is, whether a due process violation occurred. Because this case hinged almost exclusively on the relative credibility of witnesses, I conclude that a finding of prosecutorial misconduct leads to a conclusion that the defendant\u2019s due process right to a fair trial was violated.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-6\">I agree in general with the majority\u2019s statement of the current principles that our Supreme Court has articulated to govern prosecutorial misconduct claims. As the majority correctly states, in examining claims of prosecutorial misconduct, Connecticut courts presently engage in a two step analytical process. First, we consider whether \u201cmisconduct occurred in the first instance\u201d; (internal quotation marks omitted) <em>State </em>v. <em>Stevenson, </em>269 Conn. 563, 572, 849 A.2d 626 (2004); and second, if misconduct has occurred, we determine \u201cwhether that misconduct deprived [the] defendant of his due process right to a fair trial.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id. Because I conclude, however, that this process was not precisely applied in the resolution of the present claim, I wish to emphasize key points of the pivotal Supreme Court cases. Although our Supreme Court has addressed prosecutorial misconduct claims for more than one century, for my present purposes, I will focus on the key Supreme Court decisions beginning with <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>supra, 204 Conn. 523, and concluding with <em>State </em>v. <em>Stevenson, </em>supra, 563.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-7\">In <em>Williams, </em>decided in 1987, the defendant claimed that the prosecutor engaged in various instances of misconduct during the cross-examination of the defendant and a defense witness, as well as during closing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>arguments. <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>supra, 204 Conn. 524. In addressing the defendant\u2019s claims, the <em>Williams </em>court first noted that prosecutorial misconduct may occur during both cross-examination as well as during closing arguments.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The court next sought to determine whether the alleged misconduct was so serious as to amount to a denial of the defendant\u2019s due process right to a fair trial. To assist in this determination, the court set forth a multifactored analytical framework focusing on several factors. \u201cAmong them [were] the extent to which the misconduct was invited by defense conduct or argument . . . the severity of the misconduct . . . the frequency of the misconduct . . . the centrality of the misconduct to the critical issues in the case . . . the strength of the curative measures adopted . . . and the strength of the state\u2019s case.\u201d (Citations omitted.) Id., 540. Applying these factors to the facts of the case, the court concluded that the defendant had been denied his due process right to a fair trial and, accordingly, set aside the conviction and ordered a new trial. Id., 548-50.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-5\">Despite the <em>Williams </em>court\u2019s adoption of a multifac-tored analytical framework with which to determine whether misconduct deprived a defendant of a fair trial, few <em>post-Williams </em>decisions used this approach in any detail. C. Champagne, \u201cProsecutorial Misconduct in Connecticut: A Review,\u201d 78 Conn. B.J. 196, 208 (2004). Indeed, it was not until <em>State </em>v. <em>Heredia, </em>253 Conn. 543, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>754 A.2d 114 (2000), and <em>State </em>v. <em>Alexander, </em>254 Conn. 290, 755 A.2d 868 (2000), more than one decade later, that our Supreme Court embraced the multifactored approach adopted in <em>Williams. </em>Although the <em>Heredia </em>and <em>Alexander </em>courts reached different conclusions with regard to whether the respective defendants were deprived of a fair trial, both courts conducted a thorough due process analysis by applying the <em>Williams </em>multifactored approach.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-6\">The next significant development in prosecutorial misconduct analysis occurred in <em>State </em>v. <em>Ceballos, </em>266 Conn. 364, 832 A.2d 14 (2003). In <em>Ceballos, </em>which involved claimed prosecutorial improprieties similar to those in the present case, the court expressly separated prosecutorial misconduct analysis into two distinct steps, determining first whether the particular conduct alleged was improper and then turning to the ultimate question of \u201cwhether the impropriety . . . deprived the defendant of a fair trial.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 375. The court explained that these two analytical steps are \u201cseparate and distinct: (1) whether misconduct occurred in the first instance; and (2) whether that misconduct deprived a defendant of his due process right to a fair trial.\u201d Id., 381 n.29. The court further emphasized that \u201cmisconduct is misconduct, regardless of its ultimate effect on the fairness of the trial; whether that misconduct caused or contributed to a due process violation is a separate and distinct question that may only be resolved in the context of the entire trial . . . .\u201d Id. Employing this methodology, the <em>Ceballos </em>court first determined that multiple prose-cutorial improprieties had occurred and then applied the <em>Williams </em>multifactored approach in concluding that the defendant was denied his right to a fair trial. Id., 374-417.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-7\">Following <em>Ceballos, </em>our Supreme Court again addressed a claim of prosecutorial misconduct in <em>State </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>v. <em>Thompson, </em>266 Conn. 440, 832 A.2d 626 (2003). In that case, the court found numerous occurrences of misconduct, but following its application of the <em>Williams </em>factors, reversed this court\u2019s conclusion that the defendant was deprived of his right to a fair trial. Id., 467-85. Essentially, the <em>Thompson </em>court explained that only egregious misconduct will result in reversal on the basis of a due process violation and stressed that the actions of defense counsel can be crucial to determining whether misconduct has deprived a defendant of a fair trial. The court stated that it \u201cconsider[ed] it highly significant that defense counsel failed to object to any of the improper remarks, request curative instructions, or move for a mistrial. Defense counsel, therefore, presumably [did] not view the alleged impropriety as prejudicial enough to jeopardize seriously the defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial. . . . Given the defendant\u2019s failure to object, only instances of grossly egregious misconduct will be severe enough to mandate reversal.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 479-80. Put differently, although improprieties may occur, whether they amount to prosecutorial misconduct, thus necessitating consideration of the <em>Williams </em>factors, involves a factual review.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-6\">Finally, in <em>State </em>v. <em>Stevenson, </em>supra, 269 Conn. 563, our Supreme Court provided additional guidance and clarification with respect to prosecutorial misconduct analysis. The <em>Stevenson </em>court first explained that, with respect to unpreserved claims of prosecutorial misconduct, \u201cit is unnecessary for the defendant to seek to prevail under the specific requirements of <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>213 Conn. 233, 239-40, 567 A.2d 823 (1989), and, similarly, it is unnecessary for a reviewing court to apply the four-pronged <em>Golding </em>test.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>State </em>v. <em>Stevenson, </em>supra, 572-73. Rather, the <em>Stevenson </em>court held <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>that a reviewing court must apply the <em>Williams </em>factors to the entire trial. Specifically, the court noted that because the application of the <em>Williams </em>factors is identical to the third and fourth prongs of <em>Golding </em>review, applying both <em>Williams </em>and <em>Golding </em>would result in \u201cconfusion and duplication of effort.\u201d Id., 574.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-6\">Perhaps more significant to our present discussion, however, the <em>Stevenson </em>court also indicated that the two steps of prosecutorial misconduct analysis are not only \u201cseparate and distinct,\u201d but also sequential. In <em>Stevenson, </em>the court stated that <em>\u201cfollowing a determination that prosecutorial misconduct has occurred, </em>regardless of whether it was objected to, an appellate court <em>must </em>apply the <em>Williams </em>factors to the entire trial.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Id., 575. The court, therefore, indicated that a reviewing court should not consider the second step of prosecutorial misconduct analysis, the determination of whether the defendant has been deprived of a fair trial, without first determining that misconduct has in fact occurred, and further mandated that the <em>Williams </em>factors \u201cmust\u201d be applied if misconduct has occurred. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-7\">Although other cases will be discussed in greater detail, I note here that those other cases have determined that questions and answers similar to those in the present case crossed the boundaries of proper conduct. <em>State </em>v. <em>Ceballos, </em>supra, 266 Conn. 377-80 (concluding that prosecutor improperly asked defendant to testify as to veracity of other witnesses, then used answers from improper cross-examination during closing argument); <em>State </em>v. <em>Singh, </em>259 Conn. 693, 702-12, 793 A.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>226 (2002) (concluding that prosecutor committed misconduct by asking witness to comment on veracity of another witness and by emphasizing that testimony during closing arguments).</p>\n<p id=\"b126-6\">Although cases of this court and our Supreme Court have concluded that similar conduct was not misconduct, those cases blurred the boundary between the two steps of the analysis. In <em>State </em>v. <em>Sells, </em>82 Conn. App. 332, 844 A.2d 235, cert. denied, 270 Conn. 911, 853 A.2d 529 (2004), for example, a <em>Williams </em>factor was used in the first step determination. Id., 337-38 (concluding that prosecutor did not commit misconduct by asking defendant to comment on veracity of witness because prosecutor\u2019s question invited by defense counsel). <em>State </em>v. <em>Burton, </em>258 Conn. 153, 778 A.2d 955 (2001), involves a similar situation. Id., 165-66 (concluding that prosecutor\u2019s comments were invited by defense counsel and, therefore, not misconduct). It appears that, in those instances, the court, in effect, moved directly to a second step analysis without first determining whether the claimed improprieties constituted misconduct. What purported to be a consideration of whether misconduct occurred was, in reality, a consideration of whether the claimed improprieties amounted to a violation of the defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial on the basis of at least the first <em>Williams </em>factor, that is, invited misconduct. Following the conclusion on the merged steps, the court\u2019s decision was then stated in terms of whether misconduct occurred at all. I believe this is not appropriate because the reviewing court, in effect, moved to the constitutional question before resolving the factual question. Consequently, this approach runs afoul of the precedent, established by <em>Stevenson, </em>that <em>\u201cfollowing a determination that prosecutorial misconduct has occurred </em>... an appellate court must apply the <em>Williams </em>factors to the entire trial.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Stevenson, </em>supra, 269 Conn. 575. Furthermore, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>this approach is counter to the \u201c[established wisdom [that] counsels us to exercise self-restraint so as to eschew unnecessary determinations of constitutional questions.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Lemon, </em>248 Conn. 652, 663 n.15, 731 A.2d 271 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b127-6\">To my mind, the determination of whether misconduct occurred is an important step, one that a court, confronted with the challenge, must undertake in clear terms.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Assessing and controlling prosecutorial misconduct serves an important function in and of itself. As our Supreme Court stated in <em>Ceballos, </em>\u201cmisconduct is misconduct, regardless of its ultimate effect on the fairness of the trial . . . .\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Ceballos, </em>supra, 266 Conn. 381 n.29. Additionally, controlling misconduct is of particular importance given that \u201c[a] prosecutor is not only an officer of the court, like every other attorney, but is also a high public officer . . . [who] [b]y reason of his [or her] office . . . usually exercises great influence upon jurors.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Singh, </em>supra, 259 Conn. 701.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-7\">Although <em>Golding </em>review allows for skipping steps; <em>see State v. Golding, </em>supra, 213 Conn. 241-42; <em>Williams </em>review does not allow it at the present time, at least not until authorized by our Supreme Court. Cf. <em>State </em>v. <em>Ritrovato, </em>85 Conn. App. 575, 596, 858 A.2d 296 (\u201cwe need not reach the question of whether counsel\u2019s argument to the jury constituted misconduct because the claim fails under our due process analysis\u201d), cert. granted, 272 Conn. 905, 863 A.2d 699 (2004). Indeed, prosecutorial misconduct cases are difficult enough <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>without blurring the boundary between the two steps or skipping them altogether. Even when the steps are kept distinctly separate, each reviewing court must make its own assessment from a cold record of whether questions or arguments were improper. Given the fact specific nature of the inquiry, one fact specific analysis may not lead inevitably to another. No bright line test can facilitate the factual determination that each reviewing court must make.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-6\">In summary, our Supreme Court has made it clear that the analysis consists of two separate and distinct steps. The first is to identify whether the alleged improprieties constitute misconduct; the second, to determine whether any such misconduct caused a due process violation. The <em>Williams </em>factors are employed in the second step but not in the first. The first inquiry is necessarily fact specific and governed by cases bearing directly on the claimed misconduct, in this case, improper cross-examination and improper closing argument. Although certain contextual factors are important, such as whether the alleged misconduct occurred in the presence of the jury; see <em>State </em>v. <em>Stevenson, </em>supra, 269 Conn. 580 (concluding \u201cthat the questions asked outside the jury\u2019s presence during a hearing on the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress and during the assistant state\u2019s attorney\u2019s voir dire of the defendant were not improper\u201d); others, such as whether the conduct was invited by defense counsel\u2019s conduct, are not. It is also evident that only egregious misconduct is likely to result in reversal. In addition, in the second step analysis, the court\u2019s curative instructions, either general or specific, and the failure of defense counsel to object during trial may be important factors. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Thompson, </em>supra, 266 Conn. 479-80; <em>State </em>v. <em>Beaulieu, </em>82 Conn. App. 856, 873-74, 848 A.2d 500 (2004), rev\u2019d in part on other grounds, 274 Conn. 471, 876 A.2d 1155 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b129-6\">CLAIMED PROSECUTORIAL IMPROPRIETIES</p>\n<p id=\"b129-7\">Turning to the present case, my first concern, briefly put, is that the majority makes what purports to be the first step determination by considering the <em>invited conduct Williams </em>factor, which is part of the second step inquiry. My second concern is that, in employing this <em>Williams </em>factor in the analysis, the majority applies the factor in a way that justifies responsive conduct by the prosecutor that cannot be authorized as <em>invited </em>by defense conduct under any circumstances under prevailing law.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-8\">I begin by restating the instances of claimed improper cross-examination by the prosecutor, which occurred in front of the juiy. In accordance with the two step analysis, defense counsel\u2019s conduct is not relevant at this point. On cross-examination, the prosecutor questioned the defendant as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b129-9\">\u201cQ. Okay. So, you heard live testimony today from [the victim] that you went to the residence three times?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b129-10\">\u201cA. Allegedly, yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b129-11\">\u201cQ. Okay. That was July 22 twice and August 20 once. You heard that testimony today?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b129-12\">\u201cA. I guess that\u2019s what I said.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b129-13\">\u201cQ. <em>Do you believe that [the victimas] testimony is fabricated?</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b129-14\">\u201cA. <em>Yes, I do.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b129-15\">\u201cQ. <em>And we are to believe you that you weren't there?</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b129-16\">\u201cA. <em>Yes.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b129-17\">\u201cQ. Did you hear Officer Dunaj testify that he had a phone conversation with you on July 27?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>\u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-6\">\u201cQ. Did you hear Officer Dunaj testify that you admitted going on the property, you were invited and that you wanted just to get your stuff back; you heard that testimony today?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-7\">\u201cA. As I already said.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-8\">\u201cQ. <em>So, he\u2019s lying, too.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-9\">\n<em>\u201cA. That\u2019s not what I told him.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-10\">\u201cA. <em>So, is it your testimony that [the </em>victim] <em>and . . . Officer Dunaj are both lying to this jury?</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-11\">\u201cA. <em>Well, Mr. Dunaj must be, and [the victim] definitely is.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-12\">\u201cQ. <em>Okay. But you\u2019re not, you are telling the truth </em>\u2014 \u2022</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-13\">\u201cA. <em>Yes, I am.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-14\">\u201cQ. \u2014as <em>you sit here today? Why should we believe you?\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b130-15\">During a later portion of cross-examination, the prosecutor again returned to this line of questioning:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-16\">\u201cQ. <em>So, when the officer testified here today that you admitted going to the property and that you knew of the protective order, that officer on this [witness] stand, sworn in front of this jury, was lying?</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-17\">\n<em>\u201cA. Yes, he was perjuring himself.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-18\">\u201cQ. <em>But you are not perjuring yourself?</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-19\">\n<em>\u201cA. No, I am not.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-20\">\u201cQ. And is it your testimony that your belongings were being stored after your arrest at [the victim\u2019s] residence?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-21\">\u201cA. Yes, as far as I know. I never went and got them, so \u2014 that\u2019s what she stated.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>\u201cQ. You heard [the victim] testify today that on August 20, you came on the property to come and get your belongings; did you not hear that testimony?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-6\">\u201cA. I heard that testimony, yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-7\">\u201cQ. <em>So, she is lying, too?</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-8\">\u201cA. <em>Yes, she is.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-9\">\u201cQ. <em>But you\u2019re telling the truth?</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-10\">\u201cA. <em>Yes, I am.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-11\">\u201cQ. <em>And we are supposed to believe you?\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b131-12\">At this point, defense counsel objected on the ground that the question had been asked and answered. The court sustained the objection, and the prosecutor continued cross-examination:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-13\">\u201cQ. Is it your testimony that since the incidents of July 20 \u2014 July 22 and August 20, that you have not gone to the [victim\u2019s] premises . . . ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-14\">\u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-15\">\u201cQ. <em>So, is it your testimony that the testimony we heard today is fabricated?</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-16\">\u201cA. <em>Yes.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b131-17\">Thereafter, the prosecutor concluded with the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-18\">\u201cQ. <em>And you expect us to believe this? I withdraw the question. So, all of the other witnesses that testified in this case are all lying?</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-19\">\u201cA. <em>Yes.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b131-20\">Subsequently, during closing argument, the prosecutor emphasized the defendant\u2019s cross-examination testimony as follows: \u201cBut we are dealing with July 22 and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>August 20 here. What happened then? <em>Who claims all the other witnesses are lying? . </em>. .</p>\n<p id=\"b132-6\"><em>\u201c[The </em>defendant] <em>testified under cross-examination when I asked him why the other witnesses would lie, and he said, well, the officer would lie because he needs, he wants to get the conviction.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b132-7\">During rebuttal argument, the prosecutor also stated: \u201cIf you believe it\u2019s not a violation, you\u2019d have to totally discount all of [the victim\u2019s] testimony, and why would you do that?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b132-8\">In assessing the prosecutor\u2019s questions and argument under the first step principles, it is clear to me that the questions pertaining to other witnesses\u2019 veracity and the closing argument emphasizing those same improper questions and their answers were improper conduct. In <em>State </em>v. <em>Singh, </em>supra, 259 Conn. 706,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> our Supreme Court adopted the \u201cwell established evidentiary rule that it is improper to ask a witness to comment on another witness\u2019 veracity.\u201d There, as is the case here, the defendant claimed that the prosecutor engaged in misconduct by compelling the defendant, during cross-examination, to comment on the veracity of other witnesses<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and then improperly emphasized that testimony <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>during closing argument.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Id., 704-706. In concluding that the prosecutor\u2019s conduct was indeed improper, the <em>Singh </em>court explained that (1) \u201cquestions that ask a defendant to comment on another witness\u2019 veracity invade the province of the jury,\u201d which includes the determination of witness credibility, and (2) \u201cquestions of this sort also create the risk that the jury may conclude that, in order to acquit the defendant, it must find <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>that the witness has lied.\u201d Id., 707-708; see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Ceballos, </em>supra, 266 Conn. 380 (relying on <em>Singh, </em>court \u201cconclude[d] that the line of questioning about whether [a state\u2019s witness] was lying, and its use by the state\u2019s attorney in closing argument, constituted misconduct\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b134-6\">With respect to <em>Singh </em>violations, our Supreme Court has also stated that \u201c[c]ourts have long admonished prosecutors to avoid statements to the effect that if the defendant is innocent, the jury must conclude that witnesses have lied. . . . The reason for this restriction is that [t]his form of argument . . . involves a distortion of the government\u2019s burden of proof. . . . Moreover, like the problem inherent in asking a defendant to comment on the veracity of another witness, such arguments preclude the possibility that the witness\u2019 testimony conflicts with that of the defendant for a reason other than deceit.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Thompson, </em>supra, 266 Conn. 470-71.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b134-7\">In the present case, the record reveals that the prosecutor repeatedly questioned the defendant about whether the state\u2019s witnesses were lying and emphasized that line of questioning during closing argument. In addition, the prosecutor suggested during closing argument that in order for the jury to conclude that the defendant was innocent, it must conclude that the state\u2019s witnesses had lied. In light of the precedent established by <em>Singh, Ceballos </em>and <em>Thompson, </em>a \u201cseparate and distinct\u201d first step analysis reveals that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>prosecutor\u2019s questions and argument constituted misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-6\">I note, moreover, that the state has conceded that the prosecutor, during his initial and rebuttal closing arguments,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> expressed his personal opinion on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>credibility of the witnesses.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> In addition to those conceded expressions of personal opinion, the prosecutor also expressed his personal opinion by asking the defendant numerous questions, during cross-examination, that implicitly conveyed his disbelief of the defendant\u2019s testimony. Among those questions were: (1) \u201cwe are to believe you that you weren\u2019t there?\u201d; (2) \u201c[w]hy should we believe you?\u201d; (3) \u201c[b]ut you are not perjuring yourself?\u201d; (4) \u201c[b]ut you\u2019re telling the truth?\u201d; and (5) \u201c[w]e are supposed to believe you?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b136-6\">\u201cIt is well established that a prosecutor may not express her own opinion, either directly or indirectly, as to the credibility of a witness or the guilt of the defendant. . . . Such expressions of personal opinion are a form of unsworn and unchecked testimony. . . . These expressions of opinion are particularly difficult for the jury to ignore because of the special position held by the prosecutor. ... A prosecutor\u2019s voucher for a witness is particularly dangerous for two reasons. First, such comments may convey the impression that the prosecutor is aware of evidence supporting charges <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>against the defendant of which the jury has no knowledge. . . . Second, the prosecutor\u2019s opinion carries with it the imprimatur of the Government and may induce the jury to trust the Government\u2019s judgment rather than its own view of the evidence.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Alexander, </em>254 Conn. 290, 304-305, 755 A.2d 868 (2000). \u201cWhile the prosecutor is permitted to comment upon the evidence presented at trial and to argue the inferences that the jurors might draw therefrom, he is not permitted to vouch personally for the truth or veracity of the state\u2019s witnesses.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Payne, </em>260 Conn. 446, 454, 797 A.2d 1088 (2002).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Such \u201c[ijmproper comments on the part of the prosecutor regarding the veracity of one party over the other can easily skew a proper jury deliberation.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Alexander, </em>supra, 305. Accordingly, I conclude that the prosecutor improperly expressed his opinion with respect to witness credibility.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b137-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b137-7\">DUE PROCESS ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b137-8\">Having determined that the improprieties in the prosecutor\u2019s cross-examination and closing argument did constitute misconduct, I move to the second step inquiry, that is, whether the misconduct deprived the defendant of his right to a fair trial. As noted previously, \u201c[i]n determining whether prosecutorial misconduct was so serious as to amount to a denial of due process, [our Supreme Court], in conformity with courts in other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>jurisdictions, has focused on several factors. Among them are the extent to which the misconduct was invited by defense conduct or argument . . . the severity of the misconduct. . . the frequency of the misconduct . . . the centrality of the misconduct to the critical issues in the case . . . the strength of the curative measures adopted . . . and the strength of the state\u2019s case.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>supra, 204 Conn. 540. I now examine each of these factors seriatim and conclude that the defendant was deprived of his right to a fair trial by the prosecutorial misconduct in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b138-7\">Whether the Misconduct Was Invited</p>\n<p id=\"b138-8\">At first blush, it appears that the prosecutor\u2019s cross-examination of the defendant regarding the credibility of other witnesses and his use of that testimony during closing argument was invited, as the majority has concluded. I disagree. It is true that the defense attorney asked improper questions and argued improperly. For example, during direct examination, defense counsel asked the defendant to comment on the veracity of the victim and, during closing argument, expressed his personal opinion as to the victim\u2019s veracity.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> In light <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>of defense counsel\u2019s direct examination, the prosecutor was <em>invited </em>to cross-examine the defendant concerning his opinion of the veracity of the victim. That invitation, however, did not permit extensive cross-examination that delved into the defendant\u2019s opinion as to the veracity of other witnesses, including himself. One improper question does not justify a barrage of improper questions concerning witnesses other than the one at issue. The doctrine of <em>opening the door </em>is a qualified one and \u201ccannot ... be subverted into a rule for injection of prejudice.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Morascini, </em>62 Conn. App. 758, 766, 772 A.2d 703, cert. denied, 256 Conn. 921, 774 A.2d 141 (2001). While <em>State </em>v. <em>Sells, </em>supra, 82 Conn. App. 332, appears contrary to this position, it is distinguishable on two grounds. First, the statement in <em>Sells, </em>that \u201conce [the] door [has been] opened, the prosecutor ha[s] the right to inquire into the defendant\u2019s statement and ask whether <em>all </em>the witnesses in the case were lying\u201d; (emphasis added) id., 338; went far beyond the facts of that case. Second, that statement, I submit, does not find support in Connecticut case law, including <em>State </em>v. <em>Burton, </em>supra, 258 Conn. 153, the only case cited for the proposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">In addition, the present case involves far more egregious conduct on the part of the prosecutor than that of the prosecutor in <em>Sells. </em>There, the prosecutor, during cross-examination, asked the defendant a single question relating to the veracity of a state\u2019s witness. In contrast, the prosecutor in the present case questioned the defendant repeatedly, with respect to the veracity of all of the state\u2019s witnesses, and then exploited that improper cross-examination during closing argument. Moreover, I agree with the defendant that defense counsel\u2019s closing argument was necessitated by both the prosecutor\u2019s cross-examination and the prosecutor\u2019s first closing argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>B</p>\n<p id=\"b140-6\">The Frequency and Severity of the Misconduct</p>\n<p id=\"b140-7\">I next consider the frequency and severity of the misconduct in this case and conclude that the misconduct was both frequent and severe. My review of the record reveals numerous instances of improper questions or statements by the prosecutor. These improprieties were pervasive. They occurred throughout the cross-examination of the defendant and during the state\u2019s initial and rebuttal closing arguments. Moreover, both forms of misconduct, (1) questioning the defendant regarding the credibility of other witnesses and (2) expressing personal opinion regarding the credibility of witness, involved the ultimate issue of the case, credibility. The prosecutor\u2019s misconduct, therefore, occurred during both portions of the state\u2019s case and directly involved the determinative issue. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Beaulieu, </em>supra, 82 Conn. App. 873. I recognize the significance of defense counsel\u2019s failure to object at trial to the substance of the prosecutor\u2019s cross-examination and closing argument. When credibility, however, is the pivotal factor, as in the present case, \u201csuch a failure cannot be dispositive.\u201d Id. (\u201c[although the absence of a contemporaneous objection might excuse this misconduct in other circumstances, it cannot do so in the case of the credibility contest that [dominates a] case\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b140-8\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b140-9\">The Centrality of the Misconduct to Critical Issues in the Case and the Strength of the State\u2019s Case</p>\n<p id=\"b140-10\">As the majority and the state acknowledge, the state\u2019s case hinged solely on a credibility contest between the defendant and the state\u2019s witnesses. The misconduct in this case, (1) questioning of the defendant regarding the credibility of other witnesses and (2) expressing personal opinion regarding the credibility of witnesses, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>like the misconduct in <em>Singh </em>and <em>Alexander, </em>is particularly troubling because it is inextricably connected to the critical issue of credibility. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Singh, </em>supra, 259 Conn. 707 (\u201c[Determinations of credibility are for the jury, and not for witnesses. . . . Consequently, questions that ask a defendant to comment on another witness\u2019 veracity invade the province of the jury.\u201d [Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.]); <em>State </em>v. <em>Alexander, </em>supra, 254 Conn. 305 (\u201c[Expressions of personal opinion] are likely to sway a jury in favor of the prosecutor\u2019s argument without properly considering the facts in evidence. This is especially significant in the present case, where the credibility of the victim and the defendant comprised the principal issue of the case.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b141-6\">Moreover, the fact that this case was determined solely by weighing the credibility of the witnesses supports the conclusion that the state\u2019s case was not strong. See id., 308 (\u201cstate\u2019s case was not particularly strong in that it rested on the credibility of the victim\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]). Although our Supreme Court has indicated that the absence of conclusive physical evidence does not automatically render a case weak, it is axiomatic that \u201cthat same absence surely does not strengthen the state\u2019s case against the defendant.\u201d St<em>ate </em>v. <em>Ceballos, </em>supra, 266 Conn. 416. Indeed, absent additional evidence to support a finding of guilt, the prosecutor\u2019s multiple questions and comments suggesting that the defendant had lied and that the state\u2019s witnesses were \u201cmerely [in court] to tell the truth\u201d takes on increased significance. See id., 416-17 (\u201cwithout independent physical evidence to prove that the defendant had sexually assaulted [the victim], or even that [the victim] had been sexually assaulted at all, the significance of the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s improper conduct increases considerably\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>D</p>\n<p id=\"b142-6\">Curative Instructions</p>\n<p id=\"b142-7\">The court gave no specific curative instruction, nor did defense counsel request one or object to the substance of any of the prosecutor\u2019s cross-examination or closing argument. The defendant, therefore, bears responsibility for this misconduct going uncured. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Thompson, </em>supra, 266 Conn. 483. The court did give the jury general instructions.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Our Supreme Court, however, \u201chas not established a bright line rule about the corrective power of general instructions. Compare <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number><em>State v. Ceballos, </em>supra, 266 Conn. 413-15 (general instruction has only limited curative effect) with <em>State </em>v. <em>Thompson, </em>supra, 485 (presumption that jury followed court\u2019s general instructions). Both cases emphasize . . . that general instructions are only one factor, and not a determinative factor, in evaluating the prejudicial effect of a prosecutor\u2019s misconduct.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Beaulieu, </em>supra, 82 Conn. App. 874. Nevertheless, because of the egregious nature of the misconduct in the present case, I am persuaded that the general instructions in this case did not remove the harmful effect of the prosecutor\u2019s thumb on the scale of credibility. See id. In sum, given the other factors and the importance of credibility in this case, I conclude that the defendant\u2019s fair trial right was violated. Accordingly, I would reverse the convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-4\">For the foregoing reasons, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b120-7\"> Claims of prosecutorial misconduct pose a unique problem to courts because they involve a court labeling a prosecutor\u2019s actions during a trial as \u201cmisconduct,\u201d a term that may suggest <em>ethical </em>misconduct.

Why would she lie?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-13\">\u201cA. I have no idea. I had her arrested. I don\u2019t know.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b138-14\">Defense counsel also argued to the jury: \u201cSo, who is lying? I submit that it is [the victim] who is lying. Why?

Therefore, I ask you not to find her testimony credible and to find [the defendant] not guilty.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b142-8\"> In its initial charge to the jury, the court provided the following instructions: \u201cYour function, the function of the jury, is to determine the facts. You are the sole and exclusive judges of the facts, you alone determine the weight, the effect, the value of the evidence, as well as the credibility and believability of the witnesses. You must consider and weigh the testimony of all the witnesses who appear before you. You alone are to determine whether to believe any witness to the extent to which any witness should be believed. It is your responsibility to resolve any conflicts in testimony which may arise during the course of the trial and to determine where the truth lies.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b142-9\">During its final instructions, the court further explained: \u201cYou alone are responsible for determining the facts. It is your exclusive province to deal with the evidence and determine what the facts are and to reach the final conclusion as to whether the accused is guilty or not guilty. By applying the law as I give it to you to the facts as you find them to be, you will arrive at your verdict. You are the sole judges of the facts. It is your duty to find the facts. You are to recollect and weigh the evidence and form your own conclusions as to what the ultimate facts are. You may not go outside the evidence introduced in court to find the facts. . . . Also, your verdict must be based absolutely and solely upon the evidence given to you in the trial of the case. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b142-10\">\u201cYou should keep in mind that the arguments, the statements by the attorneys in final argument or during the course of the case, are not evidence. You should not consider as evidence their recollection of the facts, nor their personal beliefs as to any facts or as to the credibility of any witnesses. Nor any facts which any attorney may have presented to you in argument which that attorney\u2019s knowledge was not present \u2014 was not presented to you as evidence during the course of the trial. Furthermore, I emphasize to you that if there is any difference between what any attorney recalls as the evidence and what you recall as the evidence, it is your recollection that controls. Follow your recollection, not anyone else\u2019s.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
