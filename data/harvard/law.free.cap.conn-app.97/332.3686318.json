Culver, appeals from the judgment of conviction, rendered after a jury trial, of two counts of criminal violation of a restraining order in violation of General Statutes (Rev. to 2003) \u00a7 53a-223b. On appeal, the defendant claims that (1) his conviction under subdivisions (1) and (2) of subsection (a) of \u00a7 53a-223b violated the constitutional protection against double jeopardy, (2) subdivisions (1) and (2) of \u00a7 53a-223b (a) are unconstitutionally vague, and (3) the trial court improperly commented on the brevity of the trial. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>On the basis of the evidence presented at trial, the jury reasonably could have made the following findings of fact. The defendant and the victim, Dawn Castor, were involved in a dating relationship from February until July, 2002. On March 20, 2003, the victim obtained a temporary restraining order against the defendant, which subsequently was served on him. The restraining order provided in relevant part that the defendant \u201c[rjefrain from coming within 100 yards\u201d of the victim and \u201c[rjefrain from having any contact in any manner\u201d with the victim. At the victim\u2019s request, the restraining order was continued without modification for an additional six months following a hearing on April 2, 2003. At that hearing, the court specified that the restraining order prohibited contact \u201cdirectly or indirectly or through others\u201d and warned the defendant that \u201cthere are very serious consequences for violating court orders . . . including the potential for incarceration.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b358-6\">On the afternoon of April 11, 2003, the victim left her place of employment and drove to a nearby McDonald\u2019s restaurant. As she entered the drive-through lane, the defendant drove his vehicle alongside the passenger side of her vehicle.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> As the victim drove forward, the defendant blocked her vehicle between the curb and his vehicle. The defendant approached the passenger side of her vehicle and attempted to open her door. He stated repeatedly, \u201cI just want to talk to you.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b358-7\">While the defendant remained outside of his vehicle, the victim was able to maneuver and exit from the drive-through lane. She drove to the Waterbury police department and relayed the events that had transpired to the officer on duty, Anthony Tito. Tito verified that the victim had obtained a restraining order against the defendant. Soon thereafter, the defendant entered the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>police station and admitted that he had blocked the victim\u2019s vehicle at the restaurant and that he had attempted to engage her in conversation. The defendant further acknowledged that he was aware of the restraining order issued against him and that he had violated it. As a result, Tito placed the defendant under arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-4\">The defendant was charged with three counts of criminal violation of a restraining order, one count of unlawful restraint and one count of disorderly conduct. Following a jury trial, the defendant was convicted of two counts of criminal violation of a restraining order and acquitted of all other charges. The court imposed a total sentence of one year and nine months incarceration. This appeal followed.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Additional facts will be set forth where necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b359-6\">The defendant first claims that his conviction under subdivisions (1) and (2) of subsection (a) of \u00a7 53a-223b violated the constitutional protection against double jeopardy. The defendant concedes that he did not raise his claim at trial and requests review pursuant to <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>213 Conn. 233, 239-40, 567 A.2d 823 (1989).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>We grant review because the record is adequate for review and the claim is of constitutional magnitude.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We conclude, however, that a constitutional violation does not clearly exist and that the defendant was not deprived of a fair trial.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b360-6\">We begin by noting that \u201c[b]ecause the claim presents an issue of law, our review is plenary.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Brooks, </em>88 Conn. App. 204, 214, 868 A.2d 778, cert. denied, 273 Conn. 933, 873 A.2d 1001 (2005). The double jeopardy clause of the fifth amendment to the United States constitution provides in relevant part: \u201c[N]or shall any person be subject for the same offense to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb . . . .\u201d The double jeopardy clause of the fifth amendment is made applicable to the states through the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment to the United States constitution. <em>Benton </em>v. <em>Maryland, </em>395 U.S. 784, 794, 89 S. Ct. 2056, 23 L. Ed. 2d 707 (1969). \u201cThe fifth amendment\u2019s prohibition of double jeopardy protects persons against (1) a second prosecution for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>the same offense after acquittal, (2) a second prosecution for the same offense after conviction and (3) multiple punishments for the same offense in a single trial.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Brooks, </em>supra, 214-15.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-6\">The defendant\u2019s claim that he was convicted improperly of criminal violation of a restraining order under \u00a7 53a-223b (a) (1) and (2) falls within the double jeopardy protection against the imposition of multiple punishments for the same offense in a single trial. \u201cDouble jeopardy analysis in the context of a single trial is a two-step process. First, the charges must arise out of the same act or transaction. Second, it must be determined whether the charged crimes are the same offense. Multiple punishments are forbidden only if both conditions are met. . . . [T]he issue, though essentially constitutional, becomes one of statutory construction.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>D\u2019Antonio, </em>274 Conn. 658, 715-16, 877 A.2d 696 (2005). There is no dispute in this case that the charges against the defendant were the result of the same incident. Our inquiry, therefore, is limited to whether the offenses charged are the same offense for the purposes of the double jeopardy clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-7\">The defendant argues that \u00a7 53a-223b prohibits a \u201ccourse of action\u201d and that, as a result, subdivisions (1) and (2) of subsection (a) delineate alternative ways of violating the statute and not separate offenses.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The defendant asserts that subdivisions (1) and (2) are not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>distinct because the terms \u201cstay away from\u201d and \u201ccontact,\u201d as used within the subdivisions, can be construed as \u201csynonymous.\u201d Essentially, the defendant contends that he was subjected to multiple punishments for the same act and that the legislature specifically did not authorize separate punishments under each subdivision. The state counters that \u00a7 53a-223b (a) (1) and (2) are distinct provisions. As a result, according to the state, the defendant\u2019s conduct constituted two independent offenses, and, therefore, his conviction did not violate the prohibition against double jeopardy. We agree with the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-6\">\u201cThe traditional approach to analyzing whether two offenses constitute the same offense was set forth in <em>Blockburger </em>v. <em>United States, </em>284 U.S. 299, 52 S. Ct. 180, 76 L. Ed. 306 (1932). [W]here the same act or transaction constitutes a violation of two distinct statutory provisions, the test to be applied to determine whether there are two offenses or only one, is whether each provision requires proof of a fact which the other does not. ... In conducting this inquiry, we look only to the relevant statutes, the information, and the bill of particulars, not to the evidence presented at trial.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Greco, </em>216 Conn. 282, 291, 579 A.2d 84 (1990); <em>State </em>v. <em>Denson, </em>67 Conn. App. 803, 808-809, 789 A.2d 1075, cert. denied, 260 Conn. 915, 797 A.2d 514 (2002).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>Under the <em>Blockburger </em>test, \u201ca defendant may be convicted of two offenses arising out of the same criminal incident if each crime contains an element not found in the other.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Vass, </em>191 Conn. 604, 615, 469 A.2d 767 (1983). \u201cThe term \u2018element\u2019 as used in the <em>Blockburger </em>analysis . . . means any fact that the legislature has deemed essential to the commission of the crime.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Woodson, </em>227 Conn. 1, 10, 629 A.2d 386 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b363-6\">In reviewing \u00a7 53a-223b and the state\u2019s long form information, we note that the crimes of criminal violation of a restraining order in violation of \u00a7 53a-223b (a) (1) and (2) each clearly require proof of an element that the other does not.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In order to convict the defendant under \u00a7 53a-223b (a) (1), the state had to prove, as alleged in count two of the state\u2019s long form information, that a restraining order had been issued against him pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 46b-15,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> that he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>knew of the existence of the restraining order and its terms, and that he did not <em>stay away from </em>the victim. In order to convict the defendant under \u00a7 53a-223b (a) (2), the state had to prove, as alleged in count three of the long form information, that a restraining order had been issued against him pursuant to \u00a7 46b-15, that he knew of the existence of the restraining order and its terms, and that he <em>contacted, </em>the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-6\">We conclude that the terms \u201cstay away from,\u201d as used in subdivision (1), and \u201ccontact,\u201d as used in subdivision (2), denote separate and distinct conduct. \u201cStay away from\u201d suggests physical proximity or spatial nearness. Indeed, the restraining order issued against the defendant is framed in spatial terms in that it ordered the defendant to \u201c[r]efrain from coming within 100 yards\u201d of the victim. Additionally, we note that Random House Webster\u2019s Unabridged Dictionary (2d Ed. 2001) provides \u201cto stop or halt\u201d as one definition of \u201cstay\u201d and \u201cfrom this place or that place\u201d as one definition of \u201caway.\u201d \u201cContact,\u201d on the other hand, suggests more than mere physical presence; it implies the commission of an affirmative act. We note that one commonly understood meaning of \u201ccontact,\u201d found in Random House Webster\u2019s Unabridged Dictionary (2d Ed. 2001), is \u201cto communicate with.\u201d Further, at oral argument, the defendant conceded that \u201ccontacts\u201d requires a communicative or expressive act. As used in subdivision (2), \u201ccontacts\u201d indicates that the defendant was prohibited from having any form of communication with the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-7\">It follows from this interpretation of the statutory terms that the defendant\u2019s act of driving his car alongside the victim\u2019s car and coming within 100 yards of her constituted a violation of \u00a7 53a-223b (a) (1) in that he did not stay away from the victim. Additionally, the defendant\u2019s acts of approaching the victim\u2019s vehicle and attempting to open the door as well as speaking to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>victim constituted a violation of \u00a7 53a-223b (a) (2) in that he contacted her. Simply put, conviction under subdivision (1) of subsection (a) required proof beyond a reasonable doubt of an element not found in subdivision (2) of subsection (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b365-6\">Our interpretation of these statutoiy provisions is further supported by the basic tenet of statutory construction that the legislature does not intend to enact meaningless provisions. \u201c [N] o part of a legislative enactment is to be treated as insignificant or unnecessary, and there is a presumption of purpose behind every sentence, clause or phrase ... [so that] no word [or phrase] in a statute is to be treated as superfluous.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State v. Peeler, </em>271 Conn. 338, 434-35, 857 A.2d 808 (2004), cert. denied, 546 U.S. 845, 126 S. Ct. 94, 163 L. Ed. 2d 110 (2005). To determine that \u201cstay away from\u201d and \u201ccontacts\u201d are synonymous, as the defendant argues, would render one subdivision of the statute superfluous.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-7\">The defendant argues that it can be inferred that the legislature did not intend to punish separate crimes under \u00a7 53a-223b because it did not specify a distinct punishment under each subdivision. We note that \u201c[t]he <em>Blockburger </em>test is a rule of statutory construction, and because it serves as a means of discerning [legislative] purpose the rule should not be controlling where . . . there is a clear indication of contrary legislative intent.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Servello, 80 </em>Conn. App. 313, 322, 835 A.2d 102 (2003), cert. denied, 267 Conn. 914, 841 A.2d 220 (2004). In the present case, the statute evinces no legislative intent to prohibit multiple convictions. Moreover, the defendant\u2019s argument is unavailing because it is well established that \u201c[s]ince the legislature has shown that it knows how to bar multiple punishments expressly when it does not intend such punishment . . . the absence of similar language in those statutes provides evidence that the legislature <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>intended cumulative punishments.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 323; see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Perez, </em>78 Conn. App. 610, 642, 828 A.2d 626 (2003) (noting several statutes in which legislature expressly prohibited multiple punishments for same incident), cert. denied, 271 Conn. 901, 859 A.2d 565 (2004) .</p>\n<p id=\"b366-8\">The defendant\u2019s argument is also unpersuasive in light of prior case law. For example, in <em>State </em>v. <em>Woodson, </em>supra, 227 Conn. 9, our Supreme Court concluded that no double jeopardy violation resulted from the defendant\u2019s conviction of two counts of arson in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-lll (a) (3) and (4) where the statute did not set forth distinct punishments under each subsection. Similarly, in <em>State </em>v. <em>Tweedy, </em>219 Conn. 489, 496, 594 A.2d 906 (1991), no double j eopardy violation resulted from the defendant\u2019s conviction of two counts of kidnapping in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-92 (a) (2) (A) and (B) where separate punishments were not articulated within each subsection. It follows that multiple punishments indeed can be imposed for violations of distinct statutory provisions without contravening the prohibition against double jeopardy despite the lack of a specific authorization by the legislature. In fact, the defendant conceded at oral argument that there is no law that separate punishments under each statutory subdivision are required in order for multiple punishments to be imposed under a particular statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-9\">We conclude that, applying the test articulated in <em>Blockburger, </em>the offenses of criminal violation of a restraining order in violation of \u00a7 53a-223b (a) (1) and (2) are two separate offenses for double jeopardy purposes. As a result, the defendant has failed to demonstrate that a constitutional violation clearly existed and clearly deprived him of a fair trial. Accordingly, his claim fails under <em>Golding's </em>third prong.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b367-6\">The defendant next claims that subdivisions (1) and (2) of \u00a7 53a-223b (a) are unconstitutionally vague as applied to the facts of this case.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The defendant failed to raise this claim at trial and again seeks review under <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>supra, 213 Conn. 239-40. We will review his claim under <em>Golding </em>because the record is adequate, and a claim that a statute is unconstitutionally vague implicates a defendant\u2019s fundamental due process right to fair warning. <em>State </em>v. <em>Coleman, </em>83 Conn. App. 672, 676-77, 851 A.2d 329, cert. denied, 271 Conn. 910, 859 A.2d 571 (2004), cert. denied, 544 U.S. 1050, 125 S. Ct. 2290, 161 L. Ed. 2d 1091 (2005). We conclude, however, that a constitutional violation does not clearly exist and that the defendant was not deprived of a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-7\">We begin by setting forth the relevant legal principles. \u201cThe void for vagueness doctrine is a procedural due process concept that originally was derived from the guarantees of due process contained in the fifth and fourteenth amendments to the United States constitution. The Connecticut constitution also requires that statutes with penal consequences provide sufficient notice to citizens to apprise them of what conduct is prohibited. . . . The constitutional injunction that is commonly referred to as the void for vagueness doctrine embodies two central precepts: the right to fair warning of the effect of a governing statute or regulation and the guarantee against standardless law enforcement. ... If the meaning of a statute can be fairly ascertained a statute will not be void for vagueness since [m]any statutes will have some inherent vagueness, for [i]n most English words and phrases <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>there lurk uncertainties.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Burton, </em>258 Conn. 153, 158-59, 778 A.2d 955 (2001). \u201cFor statutes that do not implicate the especially sensitive concerns embodied in the first amendment, we determine the constitutionality of a statute under attack for vagueness by considering its applicability to the particular facts at issue.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Ortiz, </em>83 Conn. App. 142, 158, 848 A.2d 1246, cert. denied, 270 Conn. 915, 853 A.2d 530 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b368-6\">The defendant contends that he did not have adequate notice of the conduct prohibited under \u00a7 53a-223b because the terms \u201cstay away from,\u201d as used in subdivision (1) of subsection (a), and \u201ccontacts,\u201d as used in subdivision (2) of subsection (a), are not precisely defined and are subject to interchangeable use. As a result, he argues, a person of ordinary intelligence would not know what conduct was proscribed by subdivisions (1) and (2).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The state asserts that the subdivisions are not unconstitutionally vague because a person of ordinary intelligence would have ample warning that the terms \u201cstay away from\u201d and \u201ccontacts,\u201d as used in the subdivisions, prohibit distinct conduct. We agree with the state.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b368-7\">In challenging the constitutionality of a statute, the defendant bears a heavy burden. To prevail on his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>vagueness claim, \u201c[t]he defendant must demonstrate beyond a reasonable doubt that the statute, as applied to him, deprived him of adequate notice of what conduct the statute proscribed or that he fell victim to arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Springmann, </em>69 Conn. App. 400, 407, 794 A.2d 1071, cert. denied, 260 Conn. 934, 802 A.2d 89 (2002). \u201cThe proper test for determining [whether] a statute is vague as applied is whether a reasonable person would have anticipated that the statute would apply to his or her particular conduct. . . . The test is objectively applied to the actor\u2019s conduct and judged by a reasonable person\u2019s reading of the statute .... [0]ur fundamental inquiry is whether a person of ordinary intelligence would comprehend that the defendant\u2019s acts were prohibited . . . .\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Bloom, </em>86 Conn. App. 463, 469, 861 A.2d 568 (2004), cert. denied, 273 Conn. 911, 870 A.2d 1081 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b369-6\">With these principles in mind, we turn to the particular facts of this case. Section 53a-223b (a) provides in relevant part that \u201c[a] person is guilty of criminal violation of a restraining order when a restraining order has been issued against such person . . . and such person, having knowledge of the terms of the order (1) does not stay away from a person ... in violation of the order [or] (2) contacts a person in violation of the order . . . .\u201d Although the terms \u201cstay away from\u201d and \u201ccontacts\u201d are not expressly defined in the statute, \u201c[t]he lack of an express definition, does not, in and of itself, render a statute void for vagueness. ... If a statute . . . does not sufficiently define a term, it is appropriate to look to the common understanding of the term as expressed in a dictionary.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Bloom, </em>supra, 86 Conn. App. 470. In part I, we relied on the common definitions of the terms \u201cstay away from\u201d and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>\u201ccontacts\u201d to discern their respective meanings within the context of the statute. We construed \u201cstay away from\u201d to mean in a physical and spatial sense and \u201ccontacts\u201d to mean in a communicative sense. It follows from that analysis that a person of ordinary intelligence would have fair warning as to the distinct conduct proscribed by \u00a7 53a-223b (a) (1) and (2) and would anticipate that the defendant\u2019s acts of positioning his vehicle alongside the victim\u2019s vehicle, and then approaching and speaking to the victim constituted separate violations of the statute.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b370-6\">\u201c[W]e are mindful of the constitutional requirement that definiteness applies more strictly to those statutes with penal consequences rather than those merely with civil consequences.\u201d <em>Reid </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>93 Conn. App. 95, 114, 887 A.2d 937, cert. denied, 278 Conn. 921, 902 A.2d 1221 (2006). Nevertheless, we conclude that a person of ordinary intelligence would have had adequate notice that the statute prohibited two distinct acts: (1) failing to stay away from or coming within physical proximity of the victim and (2) contacting or attempting to communicate with the victim. Accordingly, the defendant\u2019s vagueness challenge fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-7\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b370-8\">The defendant\u2019s final claim is that the court improperly commented on the brevity of the trial. The defendant concedes that he did not raise his claim at trial and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>once again seeks review pursuant to <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>supra, 213 Conn. 239-40. We decline to review the defendant\u2019s claim because we conclude that the defendant has failed to establish that his claim is of constitutional magnitude under <em>Golding's </em>second prong. \u201cThe defendant . . . bears the responsibility of demonstrating that his claim is indeed a violation of a fundamental constitutional right. Patently nonconstitutional claims that are unpreserved at trial do not warrant special consideration simply because they bear a constitutional label.\u201d Id., 240.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-6\">The following additional facts are relevant to our decision as to whether the defendant\u2019s claim implicates a constitutional right under <em>Golding\u2019s </em>second prong. At the conclusion of the state\u2019s case, the court informed the jury that the trial was proceeding more quickly than had been anticipated. The court then told the jurors that they would hear any additional evidence the following morning. Before dismissing the jurors for the day, the court remarked that \u201c[a]s criminal trials go, you\u2019d be hard-pressed to find a shorter case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b371-7\">The defendant contends that the court\u2019s comment deprived him of his due process right to a trial before an impartial judge. He claims that the comment was prejudicial in that it suggested to the jury that \u201cfor all practical purposes\u201d the trial was complete at the conclusion of the state\u2019s case.

We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-8\">Our review of the record reveals that the court\u2019s comment did not implicate the defendant\u2019s due process right to a fair trial. The court\u2019s statement was a neutral one concerning the progression of the trial. Realistically, this was a short trial; the state\u2019s case lasted only one day, and the court could have anticipated the length of the defendant\u2019s case from the witnesses scheduled <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>to be called. Furthermore, the defendant\u2019s argument that the court\u2019s comment implied that there was nothing to consider as far as the defendant\u2019s case is unpersuasive because the court also informed the jury that it would be hearing the defendant\u2019s evidence the following morning.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-4\">The defendant has not demonstrated that his claim implicates his due process right to a fair trial, and, therefore, it fails to satisfy <em>Golding\u2019s </em>second prong.
