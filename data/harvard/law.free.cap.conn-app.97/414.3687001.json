On appeal, he claims that (1) there was insufficient evidence to establish assault in the first degree, (2) the trial court improperly instructed the jury and (3) the court improperly admitted prejudicial photographs into evidence. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-9\">The jury reasonably could have found the following facts. On January 10, 2002, the defendant was living in an apartment on the first floor of a house in New Haven with his girlfriend and her three children, including the victim in this case, then thirty-three month old W.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The defendant cared for W during the day while his mother was at work and his siblings were at school. Prior to January 10, 2002, the defendant had bathed W regularly without incident. At the time of the incident leading to the charges against the defendant, W was capable of climbing in and out of the bathtub on his own.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-10\">On the morning of January 10, 2002, sometime between 8 and 9 a.m., the neighbors who lived in the apartment directly above the defendant and W heard <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>loud banging noises like \u201csomebody was punching the walls\u201d coming from the defendant\u2019s apartment. They heard the defendant yell, \u201cShut the fuck up,\u201d followed by a baby crying loudly. When the baby began crying, the defendant again yelled, \u201cShut the fuck up.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b441-6\">Shortly thereafter, paramedics arrived in response to a 911 call placed by the defendant requesting medical attention for W, who had been seriously injured in the bathtub. W was wrapped in bum sheets, placed in an ambulance and rushed to Yale-New Haven Hospital. W was subsequently moved to Boston where he was treated by Robert Sheridan, a physician at the Shriners Bums Institute, which is annexed to Massachusetts General Hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-7\">When W first arrived at the Shriners Bums Institute, he had deep second and third degree bums to his legs, buttocks, perineum, hands and forearms. At the time of trial in January, 2004, W was still being treated by Sheridan and had lost eight of his toes, which had to be amputated as a result of his bum injuries. As a further result of his bum injuries, W developed a tightness of the anus with considerable medical side effects. Sheridan opined that the bum injuries sustained by W were potentially life threatening and that he will always have scars from the injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-8\">At trial, the defendant testified that he did not know that the water in the bathtub was too hot. He also testified that he did not check the temperature and that W was burned by accident. The defendant testified that he had placed W in the bathtub, gone to watch television and, when he returned to the bathroom,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> observed things floating in the bathtub, which turned out to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>pieces of W\u2019s skin. He testified that W had a look on his face that the defendant interpreted as seeking help because the water was hot.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The defendant testified that he noticed that W\u2019s skin was burned, and that he picked W up out of the bathtub,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> wrapped him in a towel and called 911.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-6\">On the morning of the incident, at about the same time that the paramedics were rushing W out of the house and into the ambulance, Sergeant Direk Rodgers of the New Haven police department entered the apartment, went into the bathroom and noticed that there was water in the bathtub and steam rising from the water. The next day, two other detectives returned to the defendant\u2019s apartment and attempted to re-create the crime. They turned the faucet to the right, approximately one quarter of a turn, which is what the defendant told the police he had done before putting W into the bathtub. When they tested the water temperature as the bathtub was filling, the thermometer indicated that the water was 160 degrees Fahrenheit. When the water in the bathtub had risen to a level of four inches, the same level as it had been on the previous day when the police entered the apartment, the detectives turned off the faucet, waited for approximately thirty minutes, and noted that the temperature of the water was then approximately 120 degrees Fahrenheit.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-7\">At trial, the defendant claimed that the injuries to W were accidental. Linda Arnold, the attending physician at Yale-New Haven Hospital and an expert on childhood brums, opined, to the contrary, stating that on the basis <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>of the pattern of the injuries and severity of the bums, W\u2019s injuries must have been inflicted intentionally and not accidentally. Thus, Arnold concluded, W\u2019s injuries were inconsistent with the defendant\u2019s explanations. Carol Jenny, a professor of pediatrics at Brown University School of Medicine, testified that W\u2019s injuries were a \u201cclassic, textbook case of abusive immersion bums.\u201d She testified that W\u2019s injuries were the result of a \u201chot, quick dip\u201d that was not accidental.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-6\">The defendant was charged with two counts of assault in the first degree \u2014 assault with intent to cause serious physical injury in violation of \u00a7 53a-59 (a) (1) and reckless assault under circumstances evincing extreme indifference to life in violation of \u00a7 53a-59 (a) (3). The defendant also was charged with risk of injury to a child in violation of \u00a7 53-21 (a) (1). The jury found the defendant guilty of reckless assault and risk of injury to a child and not guilty of intentional assault. The defendant was sentenced to a total effective term of fifteen years incarceration, execution suspended after ten years, followed by five years of probation. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b443-8\">The defendant first challenges the sufficiency of the evidence regarding his assault conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-9\">\u201cIn reviewing [a] sufficiency [of evidence] claim, we apply a two part test. First, we construe the evidence in the light most favorable to sustaining the verdict. Second, we determine whether upon the facts so construed and the inferences reasonably drawn therefrom the jury reasonably could have concluded that the cumulative force of the evidence established guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b443-10\">\u201cWhile . . . every element [must be] proven beyond a reasonable doubt in order to find the defendant guilty <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>of the charged offense, each of the basic and inferred facts underlying those conclusions need not be proved beyond a reasonable doubt. ... If it is reasonable and logical for the jury to conclude that a basic fact or an inferred fact is true, the jury is permitted to consider the fact proven and may consider it in combination with other proven facts in determining whether the cumulative effect of all the evidence proves the defendant guilty of all the elements of the crime charged beyond a reasonable doubt. . . . Moreover, [i]n evaluating evidence that could yield contrary inferences, the [jury] is not required to accept as dispositive those inferences that are consistent with the defendant\u2019s innocence. ... As we have often noted, proof beyond a reasonable doubt does not mean proof beyond all possible doubt . . . nor does proof beyond a reasonable doubt require acceptance of every hypothesis of innocence posed by the defendant that, had it been found credible by the [jury], would have resulted in an acquittal. .. . On appeal, we do not ask whether there is a reasonable view of the evidence that would support a reasonable hypothesis of innocence. We ask, instead, whether there is a reasonable view of the evidence that supports the jury\u2019s verdict of guilty.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>93 Conn. App. 844, 852-53, 890 A.2d 630 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">General Statutes \u00a7 53a-59 (a) provides: \u201cA person is guilty of assault in the first degree when .... (3) under circumstances evincing an extreme indifference to human life he recklessly engages in conduct which creates a risk of death to another person, and thereby causes serious physical injury to another person . . . .\u201d The defendant claims that the evidence adduced at trial was insufficient to prove that he was aware of and consciously disregarded a risk of death.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>This court has held that \u201c[t]he risk of death element of [\u00a7 53a-59 (a) (3)] focuses on the conduct of the defendant, not on the resulting injury to the victim. The statute does not require that the victim was in fact at a risk of death.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>34 Conn. App. 807, 812, 644 A.2d 355, cert. denied, 231 Conn. 909, 648 A.2d 158 (1994). Therefore, as applied in this context, the issue is whether immersing a child into scalding hot bathwater is reckless conduct that creates a risk of death. See id. \u201cA person acts \u2018recklessly\u2019 with respect to a result . . . when he is aware of and consciously disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that such result will occur .... The risk must be of such nature and degree that disregarding it constitutes a gross deviation from the standard of conduct that a reasonable person would observe in the situation . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 53a-3 (13). \u201cOur statutory definition of \u2018recklessly\u2019 speaks \u2018to a result or to a circumstance described by a statute defining an offense . . . .\u2019 General Statutes \u00a7 53a-3 (13). The conduct proscribed by \u00a7 53a-59 (a) (3) is that which is engaged in by a person who is \u2018aware of yet \u2018consciously disregards\u2019 a \u2018substantial and unjustifiable risk\u2019 that such a result will occur.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Giguere, </em>184 Conn. 400, 404, 439 A.2d 1040 (1981). \u201cRecklessness involves a subjective realization of that risk and a conscious decision to ignore it. . . . It does not involve intentional conduct because one who acts recklessly does not have a conscious objective to cause a particular result. . . . Because it is difficult to prove this through direct evidence, the state of mind amounting to recklessness may be inferred from conduct.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Jupin, </em>26 Conn. App. 331, 340, 602 A.2d 12, cert. denied, 221 Conn. 914, 603 A.2d 404 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b445-6\">The evidence taken in the light most favorable to sustaining the verdict shows that the jury reasonably <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>could have found that the defendant immersed W into scalding bathwater that was so hot that steam was still rising from it while the paramedics were rushing W to the hospital, resulting in life threatening second and third degree bums. The jury could have concluded that such treatment of any child is a gross deviation from a reasonable standard of conduct and that the defendant\u2019s actions constituted a conscious disregard for the risk of serious physical injury to W. Accordingly, we hold that the evidence was sufficient to support a finding that the defendant acted recklessly as defined in \u00a7 53a-3 (13) and required by \u00a7 53a-59 (a) (3).</p>\n<p id=\"b446-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b446-7\">The defendant next contends that the court improperly instructed the jury on the essential elements of assault in the first degree under \u00a7 53a-59 (a) (3).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The defendant claims that the jury was confused and misled by the court\u2019s instruction regarding extreme indifference to human life. We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-8\">Shortly after the commencement of deliberations, the jury submitted a note asking the court: \u201cDoes extreme indifference to human life mean that a person engages in an act/omission knowing that it could result in the loss of human life? Can you provide more guidance on this point?\u201d The court told the jury that \u201cthe answer to your question is yes\u201d and then reread all of the pertinent portions of its original charge<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> on reckless assault in the first degree.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>The jury submitted another note asking: \u201cDoes there need to be an element of awareness of the probability <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>or potentiality of the result/an extremely bad result to find extreme indifference for human life?\u201d The court again read all of its original instruction on reckless assault in the first degree and its first supplemental instruction covering the same material. Shortly thereafter, the jury submitted another note asking: \u201cCan we have a copy of the language you just read?\u201d A copy of the instruction was given to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-6\">The defendant does not claim that any specific language in the court\u2019s instructions was incorrect or that the court omitted any crucial language from those instructions. The defendant contends that the court should not have read to the jurors the definition of recklessness generally when they asked for a clearer definition of the instruction regarding circumstances evincing extreme indifference to human life because it was unresponsive to the jury\u2019s question and misled the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-7\">We begin by setting forth the applicable standard of review. \u201cThe principal function of a jury charge is to assist the jury in applying the law correctly to the facts which [it] might find to be established .... When reviewing [a] challenged jury instruction . . . we must adhere to the well settled rule that a charge to the jury is to be considered in its entirety . . . and judged by its total effect rather than by its individual component parts. . . . [T]he test of a court\u2019s charge is . . . whether it fairly presents the case to the jury in such a way that injustice is not done to either party .... In this inquiry we focus on the substance of the charge rather than the form of what was said not only in light of the entire charge, but also within the context of the entire trial.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Martinez, 95 </em>Conn. App. 162, 188, 896 A.2d 109, cert. denied, 279 Conn. 902, 902 A.2d 1224 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>In the court\u2019s original instruction, which the court repeated in response to the jury\u2019s inquiry, the court correctly stated that \u201cthe state must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant engaged in that reckless conduct under such circumstances which demonstrate that the defendant <em>did not care whatever about the life of[W].,\u2019 </em>(Emphasis added.) The court\u2019s explanation of the meaning of the statutory elements of \u00a7 53a-59 (a) (3), including recklessness as a predicate to its reiteration of the meaning of extreme indifference, was not inappropriate or misleading.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b449-7\">The defendant finally claims that the court improperly admitted two photographs of W\u2019s injuries because their prejudicial effect outweighed their probative value. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-8\">\u201cPotentially inflammatory photographs may be admitted into evidence if the court, in its discretion, determines that the probative value of the photographs outweighs any potential prejudice. . . . [E]ven photographs depicting gruesome scenes that may prejudice the jury are admissible, so long as, in the court\u2019s discretion, they are more probative than prejudicial.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Howard, </em>88 Conn. App. 404, 427-28, 870 A.2d 8, cert. denied, 275 Conn. 917, 883 A.2d 1250 (2005). \u201cSince the trial court exercises its broad discretion in such circumstances, its determination will not be disturbed on appeal unless a clear abuse of that discretion is shown.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 427.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-9\">The defendant challenges the admission of two photographs depicting W\u2019s injuries and the progress of his treatment. The court admitted the two photographs in order \u201cto assist the [treating physician] in indicating to the jury the treatment that was required for these injuries and which may bear on the issue of serious physical <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>injury . . . Because there were only two photographs and they were used for the purpose of proving an essential element of an offense with which the defendant was charged, the probative value of the photographs outweighed their prejudicial effect. Accordingly, the court\u2019s decision to admit the challenged photographs into evidence was not an abuse of its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-4\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-5\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b440-11\"> In accordance with our policy of protecting the privacy interests of the victims of the crime of risk of injury to a child, we decline to identify the victim or others through whom the victim\u2019s identify may be ascertained. See General Statutes \u00a7 54-86e.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b441-9\"> Although at trial, the defendant could not recall how long he was gone from the bathroom, on the date of the incident, he told various individuals that he had been out of the room for somewhere between ten and twenty minutes.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b442-8\"> At trial, the defendant testified that he did not remember hearing W scream, yell or cry while W was in the bathtub. He had told the police and investigators on January 10, 2002, that he definitely did not hear W scream, cry or yell while W was in the bathtub sustaining second and third degree bums.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b442-9\"> The defendant testified that W was a very verbal child and that he would have gotten out of the bathtub himself if the water were too hot.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b446-9\"> The defendant also claims that the court improperly refused to instruct the jury on assault in the third degree under General Statutes \u00a7 53a-61 (a) (2) as a lesser offense included within assault in the second degree under General Statutes \u00a7 53a-60 (a) (3). Because the defendant was not charged with assault in the second degree, his claim fails. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Whistnant, </em>179 Conn. 576, 427 A.2d 414 (1980).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b446-14\"> The court instructed the jury on reckless assault in the first degree under General Statutes \u00a7 53a-59 (a) (3) as follows: \u201cUnder the second count, the defendant is charged with tire crime of assault in the first degree in violation of another section of our Penal Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-15\">\u201cUnder this section of our Penal Code, a person is guilty of assault in the first degree when, under circumstances evincing an extreme indifference <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>to human life, he recklessly engages in conduct which creates a risk of death to another person and thereby causes serious physical injury to another person.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-7\">\u201cIn order to prove the defendant guilty under the second count, the state must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant, one, recklessly engaged in conduct creating a risk of death to [W] and, two, the defendant recklessly engaged in such conduct under circumstances which evinced <em>an </em>extreme indifference to human life on the part of the defendant and, three, the defendant thereby caused serious physical injury to [W].</p>\n<p id=\"b447-8\">\u201cUnder this second count, intent is not an element; rather, the state must prove beyond a reasonable doubt <em>that the </em>defendant acted recklessly and [that] his reckless conduct created a risk of death to a person.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-9\">\u201cA person acts recklessly with respect to a result or to a circumstance described by a statute defining an offense when he is aware of and consciously disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that such result will occur or that such circumstance exists. The risk must be of such a nature and degree that disregarding it constitutes a gross deviation from the standard of conduct that a reasonable person would observe in the situation.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-10\">\u201cThe standard of conduct of a reasonable person in the same situation as the defendant is the doing of something that a reasonably prudent person would do under the circumstances, or, omitting to do what a reasonably prudent person would omit doing under the circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-11\">\u201cA gross deviation is a great or substantial deviation, not just a slight or moderate deviation. There must be a great or substantial difference between, on the one hand, the defendant\u2019s conduct in disregarding a substantial and unjustifiable risk, and, on the other hand, what a reasonable person would have done under the circumstances. Whether a risk is substantial and unjustifiable is a question of fact for you to determine under all of the circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-12\">\u201cUnder the second count, the state must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant acted recklessly under such circumstances which evinced an extreme indifference to human life on the part of the defendant. This means that the state must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant engaged in that reckless conduct under such circumstances which demonstrate that the defendant did not care whatever about the life of [W]. It is a question of fact for you to decide whether or not such circumstances existed at the time of the alleged incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-13\">\u201cAlso, under ihis second count, the state has the burden to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant thereby caused serious physical injury to [W].
