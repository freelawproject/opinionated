The State\u2019s evidence was sufficient to establish that he committed those offenses in Annapolis, Maryland on April 12, 2005. Petitioner does not argue to the contrary. He does, however, argue that he is entitled to a new trial on the ground that he was unfairly prejudiced by the introduction of evidence that a drug-sniffing dog \u201calerted\u201d to currency seized from his person incident to his arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">In an unreported opinion filed on October 3, 2007, the Court of Special Appeals affirmed Petitioner\u2019s convictions. <em>Johnson v. State, </em>No. 2473, September Term, 2005, 176 Md.App. 758. Petitioner then filed a Petition for Writ of Certiorari, in which he requested that this Court answer three questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b238-6\">1. Is evidence of a drug-sniffing dog\u2019s alert to currency (and, here, to the pants in which the currency was being carried) ever admissible in criminal prosecutions, and, if so, was it admissible under the circumstances of this case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b238-7\">2. Did the Court of Special Appeals err in holding that the issue presented in Question 1 is not preserved for appellate review despite the fact that the trial court overruled Petitioner\u2019s objections and gave defense counsel a continuing objection?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b238-8\">3. Did the trial court err in allowing a canine officer to testify that, based on his test of currency drawn from a bank, the belief that most currency in general circulation is contaminated with drug residue and that a drug-sniffing dog, therefore, will always alert to currency is not a \u201clegitimate\u201d belief?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b238-9\">We granted the petition. 402 Md. 355, 936 A.2d 852 (2007). For the reasons that follow, we shall answer \u201cyes\u201d to each of Petitioner\u2019s questions, vacate the judgments of conviction and remand for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-10\">As to question 1, we are not persuaded that the Circuit Court erred or abused its discretion in overruling Petitioner\u2019s objection to the testimony that the drug-sniffing dog \u201calerted\u201d to Petitioner\u2019s pants and the currency found therein. As to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>question 2, we agree with Petitioner that the arguments he presents to this Court have been preserved for our review. As to question 3, we are persuaded that error occurred during the direct examination of the canine officer when (1) the Circuit Court overruled Petitioner\u2019s objection to a question which included the assertion that \u201csome people believe that most currency in general circulation is contaminated with drug residue ... even currency in a bank,\u201d and which asked the canine officer whether such a belief was \u201clegitimate,\u201d and (2) the officer was permitted to opine that, based upon a \u201ctest\u201d in which his dog did not alert to \u201ccurrency drawn from a bank,\u201d such a belief is not a \u201clegitimate\u201d one.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">Relevant Factual Background</p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">The opinion of the Court of Special Appeals includes the following factual summary:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b239-7\">Shortly before noon on April 12, 2005, [Petitioner] Ronald Eugene Johnson was spotted by Annapolis City Police Officer Christopher Kintop \u201cfleeing on foot from [his] location on Copeland Street towards Royal Street.\u201d The officer saw [Petitioner] turn a corner but then lost sight of him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b239-8\">Approximately twenty minutes later, Kintop and other Annapolis police officers gathered at 900 E. Royal Street in front of a house where Shayila Allen resided. The officers, suspecting that [Petitioner] was inside, knocked on Allen\u2019s door and shouted, \u201cPolice department,\u201d whereupon [Petitioner] opened the second-floor bedroom window and demanded to know what the officers wanted. They told him to come outside. A few minutes passed, during which time there was \u201ca bunch of commotion\u201d coming from the bedroom where [Petitioner] had appeared. [Petitioner] then shouted from the window a second time at the police officers.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>Seconds later, several officers entered the residence and apprehended [Petitioner]. The officers then proceeded to the second-floor bedroom where they found, strewn on the bed, a plastic bag containing 1.41 grams of marijuana, another bag containing 12 methamphetamine pills, and a small bottle containing 0.024 grams of PCP. Next to the drugs was a Nextel cell phone.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-5\">[Petitioner] was transported to the Annapolis police station and searched. Police found $845.00 in cash [in] his pants pocket, as well as a Motorola cell phone clip that fit the Nextel cell phone previously uncovered in the residence. The pants that [Petitioner] had been wearing were also seized.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-6\">Later that day, an Annapolis police dog named \u201cAries\u201d was brought in to conduct canine scans of [Petitioner\u2019s pants and the currency found inside. The dog, according to his handler \u2014 Annapolis Police Officer Christopher Tucker\u2014 was trained to detect the scent of marijuana, heroin, cocaine, methamphetamine and related drug derivatives in \u201cvarious quantities from residual to larger amounts.\u201d And the dog, according to Officer Tucker, had successfully identified drug-tainted currency on 40-50 prior occasions. In two separate scans, Aries \u201calerted\u201d to [Petitioner]^ pants and the currency inside.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b240-7\"><em>Johnson v. State, </em>No. 2473, September Term, 2005, slip op. at 1-3, 176 Md.App. 758 (footnotes omitted). Although the State did not need the canine scan evidence to generate a jury question on the issue of whether Petitioner had been in possession of the drugs found in the bedroom, because Petitioner was not in actual possession of any drugs when he was finally taken into custody, the canine scan evidence was obviously of significant consequence to the issue of whether the State had satisfied its burden of persuasion.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-8\">The following transpired during a pretrial <em>in limine </em>hearing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-9\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: ... The next [motion <em>in </em>limine] is that the State attorney, I believe, will be trying to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>introduce evidence of the dog alert to my client\u2019s pants. I would argue that that would be misleading to the jury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-5\">They would take more weight out of what that particular experience is about and that would unnecessarily lead them to a conclusion that there were actually drugs there when the dog\u2019s alert is really to an owner [odor] \u2014 it gives probable cause when you are trying to arrest somebody, but I don\u2019t believe that that should be coming in as substantive evidence against my client on these particular drug charges.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b241-6\">The Circuit Court denied the motion \u201cat this moment,\u201d but agreed to \u201crevisit\u201d this issue during the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-7\">The prosecutor\u2019s opening statement, which made no mention of the canine scan evidence, included the following comments:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-8\">Well, in this case the Defendant made a mistake. Basically, he was wanted by the police on the date in question.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-9\">\u2756 * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-10\">Well Officer Kintop . .. sees the Defendant and he almost gets him. And he is wanted at this point, but he gets away.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-11\">But that doesn\u2019t stop the police, they are still looking for this Defendant. And ... the police find him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-12\">And they go to the house where the Defendant is. The police surround the house and, low and behold, they see the Defendant\u2019s face pop up and look out the window. And they know who it is, so they know that it is him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-13\">As the police are surrounding the house, something funny happened. They start hearing things moving around, the furniture. Remember, this is a bedroom that is like looking out over the street. And the police hear all this noise, so they know he is up to something.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-14\">So the police surround him. They have a consent to search the place from the actual homeowner. He comes out and he surrenders himself. They take him into custody. And the police go up to that very room where he had just been spotted and, low and behold, there are drugs.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-5\">By the way, something else happened that was kind of significant. When the police come in, all the drugs are on this bed, basically, hastily dumped because the Defendant didn\u2019t have time to do a better job of hiding his stash.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-6\">But there is a cell phone on that bed. And when the police actually take this Defendant into custody he has got a cell phone clip on his belt, but no cell phone. The cell phone is one of the things that got dumped because that is probably where he is getting those calls in from people who want to buy drugs.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-7\">So the police \u2014 it is real simple, but they basically take the phone and you know what? It is a perfect match; it is a fit. And you will be able to see the cell phone. And you will be able to hear from the Detective who seized the clip and ... will tell you that he matched the clip up.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b242-8\">The opening statement by Petitioner\u2019s trial counsel likewise made no mention of the canine scan evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-9\">When the State called Officer Tucker to the stand, Petitioner\u2019s trial counsel requested a bench conference, and the Circuit Court granted that request. The following transpired at the bench:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-10\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: I just want to preserve this issue. I hear the Court\u2019s ruling and I just want to say that I object to anything that Officer Tucker has to say.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-11\">I think that his testimony will be irrelevant. And if it is deemed relevant, it will be confusing and misleading to the jury. He can testify about probable cause. If he is not able to say yes, the drug dog is, you know, like a chemical reaction test that gives us proof that it was drugs in his pants.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-12\">THE COURT: All right. I will take that under advisement. My ruling stands right now.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b242-13\">At this point, Petitioner\u2019s trial counsel requested a \u201ccontinuing objection\u201d to the canine scan evidence, and the Circuit Court granted that request. During Officer Tucker\u2019s direct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>examination, he was asked a series of \u201cqualifications\u201d questions, most of which are included in \u00a7 4.1 (Predicate questions for direct examination of [the] canine handler) of a \u201cguide\u201d prepared by a staff attorney in the Drug Enforcement Administration\u2019s Office of Chief Counsel, and \u201cdesigned to suggest ways the canine handler and prosecutor can strengthen the impact of canine alert \u2018testimony\u2019 in court.\u201d This guide includes the following recommendations:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-4\">4 Preparing The Canine Handler For Trial</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-5\">The canine handler, having followed the proper procedures governing the use of the canine and having thoroughly documented the activities of the canine, must still be prepared to persuade a judge or jury that the canine is competent to detect the scent of drugs and that the handler is competent to interpret the canine\u2019s message. The government counsel, likewise, should be prepared to counter challenges to the canine\u2019s evidence, which often takes the form of evidence of currency contamination.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-6\">4.1 Predicate questions for direct examination of canine handler</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-7\">The government attorney must be prepared to set out the qualifications of both the canine and the handler in a convincing manner at trial. The following is a sample of predicate questions which may assist the government attorney in doing this.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-8\">1. How long have you been employed in your present occupation and what is the nature of your duties and responsibilities?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-9\">2. What specialized training have you had in the handling of a drug canine? How long have you been paired with this canine?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-10\">3. What specialized training has the canine had in the detection of drugs? What was the canine required to do in order to successfully complete that training?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-11\">4. Has the canine been trained on controlled substances or \u201cpseudo-substances\u201d? Is it better to train a canine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>on controlled substances? What do you use when training your canine?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-5\">. Describe the process by which the canine is certified to detect drugs and you are certified to handle the canine.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-6\">. How often are you each recertified and describe that process?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-7\">. How many hours per week do you train your canine? Describe the training activities and explain the importance of these activities to the canine\u2019s performance. Do you document this training?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-8\">. Have you ever discovered that your canine was alerting to a scent other than a drug scent, and, if so, what steps have you taken to correct that behavior? Have you .documented these instances?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-9\">. Has the canine ever alerted and a subsequent search failed to reveal either drugs or money? In those instances, has your follow-up discovered evidence to suggest that drugs were in fact present at one time in that area? Have you documented these instances?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-10\">. What quantity of drugs has your dog been trained on and what quantity do you use when training your dog?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-11\">11. Have you ever tested your canine with currency drawn from a bank to determine if your canine is mistakenly alerting just to the scent of currency in general circulation? Have you documented those instances?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-12\">12. Some people believe that most of the currency in general circulation is contaminated with drug residue, and that therefore a canine will always alert to currency, even currency in a bank. Based upon your tests with currency drawn from banks, is that a legitimate belief?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-13\">13. When seized currency is to be tested by [the] canine, how is the testing area prepared and how.is the curren<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>cy handled to insure that the canine is not alerting to a scent other than the scent of drugs?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">William E. Ringel, <em>Searches and Seizures, Arrests and Confessions, </em>app. 6, \u00a7\u00a7 4 &amp; 4.1 (West ed. Supp. 2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b245-6\">The following transpired during Officer Tucker\u2019s direct examination:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-7\">[THE PROSECUTOR:] And have you ever discovered that your canine was alerting to a scent other than a drug scent?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-8\">[OFFICER TUCKER:] No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-9\">[THE PROSECUTOR:] And has the canine ever alerted [where] a subsequent search failed to reveal either drugs or money?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-10\">[OFFICER TUCKER:] Neither drugs or money. Is that what you said?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-11\">[THE PROSECUTOR:] Yes. Or either drugs or money? [OFFICER TUCKER:] Yes, that has occurred.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-12\">[THE PROSECUTOR:] And in those instances[,] has your follow-up discovered evidence to suggest that drugs were in fact present at one time in that area?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-13\">[OFFICER TUCKER:] Yes, many times.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-14\">[THE PROSECUTOR:] And have you documented those instances?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-15\">[OFFICER TUCKER:] Yes, I have.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-16\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-17\">[THE PROSECUTOR:] And how many times have you used your canine to examine currency?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-18\">[OFFICER TUCKER:] Approximately, I\u2019d say 50-40, 50 times.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-19\">[THE PROSECUTOR:] And how many times that you know of has your dog alerted?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-20\">[OFFICER TUCKER:] In street patrol, those 40 to 50 times[,] they\u2019ve actually all been positive alerts.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-21\">[THE PROSECUTOR:] And have you ever tested your canine with currency drawn from a bank to determine if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>your canine is mistakenly alerting just to the scent of currency in general circulation?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b246-5\">[OFFICER TUCKER:] Yes, I have.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b246-6\">[THE PROSECUTOR:] And what [were] the results of that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ALf\">[OFFICER TUCKER:] It was a controlled \u2014 training situation. The dog did not alert to the \u2014 it was circulated currency drawn from a bank.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b246-8\">[THE PROSECUTOR:] And some people believe that most of the currency in general circulation is contaminated with drug residue and that therefore canine will always alert to currency, even currency in a bank. Based on your test of the currency drawn from a bank, was that a legitimate [belief]?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b246-9\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL:] Objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b246-10\">THE COURT: Overruled. You may answer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b246-11\">[OFFICER TUCKER:] I don\u2019t believe so, no.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b246-12\">[THE PROSECUTOR:] And when seized currency is to be tested by the canine, how is the testing area prepared?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b246-13\">[OFFICER TUCKER:] Well, I always make sure that the [officer] is instructed to have the money packaged in a clean package, whether it\u2019s an envelope or bag.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b246-14\">I also make sure I always bring my canine into the area that\u2019s going to be used for the testing before the money is placed by that officer and allow them to search the area to insure that they don\u2019t give any positive alerts; that is, they aren\u2019t being contaminated by controlled substances at some other prior time or some other drugs there that could compromise the actual search of the currency that\u2019s going to be performed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b246-15\">Officer Tucker then testified about the scans performed on Petitioner\u2019s clothing and on the cash seized from Petitioner\u2019s person. According to Officer Tucker, \u201cthe dog was alerting to the scent of controlled substances, which he is trained to detect[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b247-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>The prosecutor\u2019s closing argument included the following comments:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b247-5\">Finally, perhaps some of the best evidence is the dog. This is a good dog. The dog is named Aries. He and his handler have been through a ton of training. And I invite you to take a look at the exhibits that were entered. The certifications that he has been through.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b247-6\">Not only does he get these certifications, but he goes through them on a yearly basis. He keeps training with the dog. He goes to the classes. But importantly, every single day he is working with that dog. He lives with that dog. That dog is a very important part of his life.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b247-7\">He knows that dog well. They hang around at the station and make up drills for the dog sometimes just for fun. Sometimes they try to trick the dog. They give him a non-CDS item and they try to see if the dog will alert on it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b247-8\">And what Officer Tucker said was really important. This is a good dog. This is a dog that doesn\u2019t make mistakes. He hasn\u2019t had to go through and try to retrain the dog except that when it takes out the wrong substance. It doesn\u2019t. When that dog smells what it believes to be CDS, it sits. It alerts is what we call it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b247-9\">And in this case, they have the Defendant take off his pants. They clear the room. They have the dog search the room when there is nothing in it; no drugs, no items.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b247-10\">They bring the dog back out. They hide the pants. They hide the $845 that the Defendant had and guess what? The dog alerts. You can\u2019t fool the dog. The dog alerted to the Defendant\u2019s pants pocket.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b247-11\">So you will have that as evidence. The \u2014 was cut out; it was not the entire pair of pants. But the dog alerted because the drugs were in the Defendant\u2019s pants. They were on his person when the house got surrounded and the Defendant ha[d] to unload the drugs. You can\u2019t fool the dog.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b247-12\">During the closing argument for the defense, Petitioner\u2019s trial counsel emphasized the fact that no \u201cfingerprint\u201d evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>dence or \u201cDNA\u201d evidence linked Petitioner to the drugs, suggested that the drugs belonged to the occupants of the house, and urged the jurors \u201cto ask yourself if you had five to ten minutes do you leave the drugs out in the middle of the bedroom?\u201d Petitioner\u2019s trial counsel did not, however, say anything about the canine scan evidence.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-5\">During the State\u2019s rebuttal argument, the prosecutor stated: Number two, if Ms. Allen is the person whose drugs they were; whose phone was there, why is the dog picking out his pants out of the room? Why is the dog picking out the Defendant\u2019s money in this room?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b248-6\">As stated above, Petitioner was convicted of the burglary and controlled dangerous substances violations, those convictions were affirmed by the Court of Special Appeals, and this Court granted his petition for writ of certiorari.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-7\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b248-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-9\">Petitioner\u2019s argument that the canine scan evidence should have been excluded under Md. Rules 5-401 and/or 5-408 is based upon the argument that the Circuit Court should have taken judicial notice of the \u201ccurrency contamination theory.\u201d We are persuaded, however, that the Circuit Court did not err or abuse its discretion in overruling Petitioner\u2019s objection to Officer Tucker\u2019s testimony that \u201cthe dog was alerting to the scent of controlled substances[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b248-10\">The currency contamination theory is based upon the assumption that a high percentage of United States currency bills in circulation contain trace amounts of cocaine and/or other drug residue. <em>See, e.g., Illinois v. Caballes, </em>548 U.S. 405, 412, 125 S.Ct. 834, 160 L.Ed.2d 842 (2005) (Souter, J., dissenting) (noting \u201cthe pervasive contamination of currency by cocaine\u201d); <em>Bennis v.

Saccoccia, </em>58 F.3d 754, 777 (1st Cir.1995) (recognizing the \u201cwidespread contamination of currency\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">Although not yet \u201cas numerous as the sands of the sea,\u201d cases discussing the currency contamination theory often cannot be reconciled.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Because Petitioner did not present any expert testimony in support of his argument that canine scan evidence is \u201cmisleading,\u201d the case at bar does not present admissibility issues involving such testimony.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Petitioner requests that, pursuant to Md. Rule 5-201(b), this Court \u201cjudicially notice\u201d that currency contamination is so widespread as to require the exclusion of the canine scan evidence in the case at bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">Maryland Rule 5-201(b), which is identical to Rule 201(b) of the Federal Rules of Evidence, requires that a judicially noted fact be \u201ceither (1) generally known within the territorial jurisdiction of the trial court or (2) capable of accurate and ready determination by resort to sources whose accuracy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>cannot reasonably be questioned.\u201d Of the cases that have addressed the question of whether the trial court should take judicial notice of the fact that <em>most </em>currency in circulation contains detectable traces of controlled dangerous substances, we are persuaded that the better reasoned cases are the ones holding that such a fact should not be judicially noticed.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-4\">Cases holding that the result of a properly conducted canine scan test does have <em>some </em>probative value include <em>United States v. Carr, </em>25 F.3d 1194 (3d Cir.1994), <em>United States v. Funds in Amount of Thirty Thousand Six Hundred Seventy Dollars, </em>403 F.3d 448, 459-60 (7th Cir.2005), <em>United States v. Jaimes, </em>297 F.Supp.2d 1254, 1255-56 (D.Haw.2003), and <em>Evans v. City of Aberdeen, </em>926 So.2d 181, 185 (Miss.2006). In <em>Carr, </em>while rejecting a request to take judicial notice that nearly all currency contains detectable traces of illegal narcotics, the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-5\">Both Carr and Cardona argue that any evidence concerning positive drug-sniff identifications by the trained canines should not be considered probative of guilt, given that studies have shown that between seventy and ninety-seven percent of all cash in circulation in the United States is tainted with a sufficient quantity of cocaine to alert a trained dog. <em>See United States v. Fifty-three Thousand Eighty-two Dollars ($53,082) in United States Currency, </em>985 F.2d 245, 250-51 n. 5 (6th Cir.1993) (dicta questioning the evidentiary value of a trained dog\u2019s alert to currency); <em>United States v. Six Hundred Thirty-nine Thousand Five Hundred and Fifty-eight Dollars ($639,558) in United States Currency, </em>955 F.2d 712, 714 n. 2 (D.C.Cir.1992) (dicta discussing studies). Citing only to these two cases as authority, they argue that the alerts mean nothing. At oral argument Carr requested that this court take judicial notice of the fact that a large percentage of dollar bills in circulation is tainted with illegal narcotics, without directing the court to any particular study.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-6\">Under Federal Rule of Evidence 201(f), judicial notice of an adjudicative fact may be taken by an appellate court. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>However, the \u201cfact must be one not subject to reasonable dispute in that it is either (1) generally known within the territorial jurisdiction of the trial court or (2) capable of accurate and ready determination by resort to sources whose accuracy cannot reasonable be questioned.\u201d Fed. R.Ev. 201(b). We decline to take judicial notice in this instance because we do not believe that such a fact is either commonly known or readily determinable through unquestionably reliable sources.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-5\"><em>* </em>* *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-6\">Because we decline the defendants\u2019 invitation to take judicial notice of the fact that nearly all currency contains detectable traces of illegal narcotics, we consider the dog alert evidence as only another piece of evidence tending to show that Carr and Cardona knew that the money involved in the conspiracy was derived from illegal drug trafficking. We note that the cases relied on by Carr and Cardona for authority, that courts of appeals increasingly are calling dog alert evidence into doubt, discuss this proposition only in dicta because in both cases the courts independently upheld a trial court\u2019s grant of a motion to suppress the cash as evidence. <em>United States v. $53,082, </em>985 F.2d [245] at 250 [(6th Cir.1993)]; <em>United States v. $639,558, </em>955 F.2d [712] at 714 [(D.C.Cir.1992)]. Furthermore, this court has recognized that a district court has discretion to admit a trained dog\u2019s alert to currency as evidence of guilt. <em>See United States v. Headley, </em>923 F.2d 1079, 1082 n. 1 (3d Cir.1991). On this record, we cannot say that the district court abused its discretion in admitting the dog sniff evidence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b251-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 1203 n. 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-8\">In <em>Saccoccia, supra, </em>while affirming racketeering and related convictions, and rejecting the argument that the appellant was unfairly prejudiced by the testimony of a canine unit officer whose drug sniffing dog alerted to the presence of drugs on cash that the appellant had deposited into a bank, the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>Even though widespread contamination of currency plainly lessens the impact of dog sniff evidence, a trained dog\u2019s alert still retains some probative value. Ordinary experience suggests that currency used to purchase narcotics is more likely than other currency to have come into contact with drugs.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b252-5\"><em>Saccoccia, </em>58 F.3d at 777. We agree -with this analysis, and therefore hold that \u2014 at this point in time \u2014 it cannot be judicially noticed that currency contamination is so widespread as to require the exclusion of canine scan evidence.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b252-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-7\">We are persuaded that the issue presented in Petitioner\u2019s third question was preserved for appellate review. The record shows that, subsequent to the denial of Petitioner\u2019s <em>in limine </em>motion to exclude the \u201cdog alert\u201d evidence, (1) Petitioner\u2019s trial counsel requested a \u201ccontinuing objection\u201d to the line of questions pertaining to the \u201calert,\u201d and (2) the Circuit Court granted that request. Under Md. Rule 4-323(b), however, a \u201ccontinuing objection is effective only as to questions clearly within its scope.\u201d A line of questions that introduce and purportedly discredit the currency contamination theory is not \u201cclearly within [the] scope\u201d of the continuing objection granted by the Circuit Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-8\">The record also shows that Petitioner\u2019s trial counsel interposed a timely <em>general </em>objection to Officer Tucker\u2019s opinion. Under Md. Rule 4-323(a), the Circuit Court could have directed that Petitioner\u2019s trial counsel state the grounds for the objection. The Circuit Court, however, overruled the objection without directing that the grounds for the objection be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>stated. In <em>DeLeon v. State, </em>407 Md. 16, 962 A.2d 383 (2008), this Court reaffirmed the well settled principle that \u201ca party basing an appeal on a \u2018general\u2019 objection to admission of certain evidence, may argue <em>any </em>ground against its inadmissibility. <em>Boyd v. State, </em>399 Md. 457, 475-76, 924 A.2d 1112, 1122-23 (2007).\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 24-25, 962 A.2d at 387 (emphasis in original). Under these circumstances, Petitioner\u2019s present argument was not waived.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-5\"> Although the parties have argued that the determination of whether the State was entitled to ask the \u201clegitimate belief\u201d question during Officer Tucker\u2019s direct examination presents \u201cscientific evidence\u201d and \u201cexpert testimony\u201d issues, the case at bar actually presents an \u201corder of proof\u201d issue. For the reasons that follow, we hold that Petitioner was unfairly prejudiced during the State\u2019s case-in-chief when the prosecutor raised the currency contamination theory and then presented expert testimony refuting that theory.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">The State was certainly entitled to establish the qualifications of both Officer Tucker and Aries,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and to ask questions about techniques employed to make sure that the dog would not alert to \u201cuncontaminated\u201d currency. The Circuit Court, however, should have sustained Petitioner\u2019s objection to the \u201ccurrency contamination\u201d question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b254-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>And some people believe that most of the currency in general circulation is contaminated with drug residue and that therefore canine will always alert to currency, even currency in a bank. Based on your test of currency drawn from a bank, was that a legitimate [belief]?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">This question was objectionable for six reasons. First, it assumed a fact not in evidence. \u201cAn argumentative question is one which incorporates by assumption a fact otherwise not in evidence.\u201d <em>Clermont v. State, </em>348 Md. 419, 431, 704 A.2d 880, 886 (1998). \u201cQuestions that assume facts not in evidence are an objectionable subcategory of leading questions[.]\u201d McLain, <em>Maryland Evidence </em>\u00a7 611.5 (2001). \u201cWhen a question asserts facts that have not been established at trial, the question is objectionable because it brings to the attention of the jury facts that are not in evidence.\u201d Dennis D. Prater et. ah, <em>Evidence: The Objection Method </em>7 (2d ed. 2002). <em>See also </em>Ashley S. Lipson, <em>Is it Admissible? </em>\u00a7\u00a7 4.100-4.600 (Ben Ritter ed., James Publishing, Inc., rev. 10th ed. Supp. 2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b254-6\">Moreover, even if the \u201cassumes a fact not in evidence\u201d objection would be inapplicable to a question which assumes a judicially noticed fact that is not subject to reasonable dispute, the question at issue is not such a question. While it may well be a fact that there are \u201csome people\u201d who believe that a \u201ccanine will always alert to ... [newly printed] currency in a bank,\u201d for the reasons stated in part I. of this opinion, such a fact could not be \u201cjudicially noticed\u201d under Md. Rule 5-201(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b254-7\">Second, both the question and the answer were unclear and therefore \u201clikely to confuse and mislead the jury by asking of the witness his opinion upon facts ... not completely stated[.]\u201d <em>Donnelly v. Donnelly, </em>156 Md. 81, 86, 143 A. 648, 651 (1928). How many people are \u201csome\u201d people? How much currency is \u201cmost\u201d currency? Does \u201ccurrency in a bank\u201d include newly printed currency? Was the \u201ctest of currency drawn from a bank\u201d performed on randomly selected currency or. newly printed currency? Was the answer suggesting that only a small percentage of currency is actually contaminated, or that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>it would be unreasonable to believe that a large percentage of currency is contaminated?</p>\n<p id=\"b255-5\">Third, the question called for an opinion that had not been the subject of discovery. In <em>Ragland v. State, </em>385 Md. 706, 870 A.2d 609 (2005), this Court held that opinions based on a witness\u2019s \u201ctraining and experience ... should only [be] admitted as expert testimony, subject to the accompanying qualification and discovery procedures.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 709, 870 A.2d at 611. In the case at bar, Petitioner\u2019s trial counsel requested discovery of all tests, experiments and conclusions that the State intended to present at trial. Although the State obviously complied with its duty to put the defense on notice that it would be presenting the \u201cdrug dog alert\u201d evidence, Md. Rule 4-263(b)(4)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> also required that the State put the defense on notice of its intention to present expert testimony debunking the currency contamination theory.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-6\">Fourth, although the State established that Officer Tucker is \u201can expert in the area of canine police work,\u201d the State did not establish that he is qualified to express an opinion about the percentage of cash that is contaminated with drug residue. <em>In re Yve S., </em>373 Md. 551, 819 A.2d 1030 (2003), this Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-7\">[T]he mere fact that a witness has been accepted to testify as an expert in a given field is not a license to testify at will. Such a witness only will be allowed to testify as an expert in areas where he or she has been qualified and accepted. Where a witness who is qualified as an expert in one area strays beyond the bounds of those qualifications into areas reserved for other types of expertise, issues may arise as to the proper admissibility of that testimony.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b255-8\">373 Md. at 613, 819 A.2d at 1066.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-9\">Fifth, the question called for an answer based upon a single test, and was not preceded by a foundational showing that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>test was conducted \u201cunder similar conditions and like circumstances to those existing in the case at issue.\u201d <em>Smith v. State Rds. Comm\u2019n, </em>240 Md. 525, 537, 214 A.2d 792, 798 (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">Sixth, the question was unfairly prejudicial because it violated the rule against the introduction of \u201canticipatory rehabilitation\u201d and/or \u201cstrawman rebuttal\u201d evidence. Under this rule, unless the defendant\u2019s opening statement and/or <em>cross-examination </em>of a State\u2019s witness has \u201copened the door\u201d to evidence that is relevant (and <em>now </em>admissible) for the purpose of either rehabilitation or rebuttal, the State is prohibited from introducing during its case-in-chief \u2014 and thereafter rebutting \u2014 such evidence in order to \u201cbolster\u201d that witness\u2019s testimony.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Because this rule applies to expert testimony as well as to non-expert testimony, the Circuit Court should have prohibited the State from bolstering Officer Tucker\u2019s testimony about the significance of the canine scan.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-6\">It is well settled that \u201c[a]ny competent evidence which explains, or is a direct reply to, or a contradiction of, material evidence <em>introduced by the accused </em>may be produced by the prosecution in rebuttal.\u201d <em>Lane v. State, </em>226 Md. 81, 90, 172 A.2d 400, 404 (1961) (emphasis added). It is equally well settled that the State\u2019s case-in-chief may include \u201crebuttal\u201d evidence to which the defense has \u201copened the door,\u201d either during opening statement, or through cross-examination of a State\u2019s witness. As to opening statements, in <em>Martin v. State, </em>364 Md. 692, 775 A.2d 385 (2001), this Court agreed with the trial court\u2019s conclusion that defense counsel\u2019s opening statement had .\u201copened the door\u201d to \u201crebuttal evidence\u201d that the State was then entitled to present during its case-in-chief. <em>Id. </em>at 707-08, 775 A.2d at 394. In the case at bar, however, the opening statement of Petitioner\u2019s trial counsel did not \u201copen the door\u201d to the opinion at issue, which was mentioned for the first time during Officer Tucker\u2019s <em>direct </em>examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>The prohibition against \u201canticipatory rehabilitation\u201d and/or \u201cstrawman rebuttal\u201d evidence is well established. In <em>Weiner [a/k/a Werner] v. State, 55 </em>Md.App. 548, 464 A.2d 1096 (1983), a defendant who had been convicted of carnal knowledge and statutory rape of his stepdaughter was granted a new trial on the ground that, during the stepdaughter\u2019s direct examination, she testified that she decided to report her stepfather to the police only after she was told that he had subsequently molested her younger sister. Rejecting the argument that the State was entitled to present this \u201canticipatory rehabilitation\u201d evidence, the Court of Special Appeals stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-5\">[W]e point out that the disputed testimony was initially introduced by the State, apparently in anticipation of the defense seizing upon any unexplained delay as an attack upon the credibility of the prosecuting witness, Amy. Had the State remained silent regarding the lapse of time from the last act of intercourse until Amy\u2019s complaint, Appellant\u2019s dilemma would have been whether to avoid the issue and lose the advantage of bringing the delay to the attention of the jury, or to cross-examine Amy concerning her five year silence, with the attendant risk that her answers would reveal the very evidence the Appellant sought to suppress.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-6\">If the testimony of other crimes came about through cross-examination by counsel for Appellant, or from other defense testimony, we perceive no reason why it should not have been admitted. The State\u2019s initial presentation of the evidence in anticipation of a defense tactic that may well have never taken place, however, is another matter. We conclude that the introduction of this testimony by the State in its case in chief was prejudicial error.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b257-7\"><em>Id </em>at 558, 464 A.2d at 1102-03.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-8\">While affirming the decision of the Court of Special Appeals, <em>State v. Werner, </em>302 Md. 550, 489 A.2d 1119 (1985), this Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-9\">[T]he failure of a sex offense victim to complain at the time of the crime or shortly thereafter is ... an impeaching <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>circumstance which, if elicited by the defense, can then be explained by the State.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b258-5\">In the instant case, however, the State impeached its own witness by bringing out on direct examination the fact that she waited five years to complain. This was, it would seem, inadmissible evidence as part of the State\u2019s case in chief. But, whether or not inadmissible, it was not necessary. The State itself, by this \u201cbootstrap\u201d operation, created the alleged need for presenting evidence of other crimes by the defendant. The Court of Special Appeals correctly held that, under these circumstances, the evidence of other offenses was inadmissible.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b258-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 565, 489 A.2d at 1126-27 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b258-7\">In <em>Wynn v. State, </em>351 Md. 307, 718 A.2d 588 (1998), while reversing housebreaking and theft convictions on the ground that the petitioner was unfairly prejudiced by evidence that he had committed other housebreakings, this Court made it clear that the State could not assert the \u201cmistake\u201d defense in order to introduce \u201cabsence of mistake\u201d evidence during its case-in-chief:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b258-8\">Under the circumstances of the case at hand, the absence of mistake exception is not applicable for two reasons. First, petitioner never asserted that he entered the house mistakenly or that the housebreaking was a mistake.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b258-9\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b258-10\">In order to admit the other crimes evidence the State may have been creating a straw person by inferring that petitioner claimed he purchased the property at a flea market and that claim was a \u201cmistake.\u201d The jury had to determine whether petitioner stole the property or purchased the property not whether, if he purchased the property, he was mistaken in doing so in that it was stolen property.... Under these circumstances, where there is no defense of mistake in reference to the housebreaking and no suggestion that the property might have been mistakenly stolen, believing he had a right to take it, absence of mistake is irrelevant. It is clear that the only possible inference the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>jury could have drawn from the other crimes evidence was that if petitioner had property from separate housebreakings, he must have been the housebreaker.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b259-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 381-82, 718 A.2d at 600.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">Having concluded that the Circuit Court should have sustained Petitioner\u2019s objection to the question asserting that \u201csome people believe that most currency in general circulation is contaminated with drug residue ... even currency in a bank,\u201d thereby excluding the canine officer\u2019s opinion that such a belief is not a \u201clegitimate\u201d one, we are required to order a new trial unless we are \u201cpersuaded beyond a reasonable doubt that [the inadmissible evidence admitted over Petitioner\u2019s objection] did not contribute to the guilty verdict[s] returned against [him].\u201d <em>Dorsey v. State, </em>276 Md. 638, 659, 350 A.2d 665, 678 (1976). As stated above, because Petitioner was not in actual possession of any drugs when he was finally taken into custody, the canine scan evidence was obviously of significant consequence to the issue of whether the State had satisfied its burden of persuasion. In light of the importance that the State attached to the canine scan evidence, we are not persuaded beyond a reasonable doubt that the introduction of the inadmissible evidence constituted harmless error.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-6\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS REVERSED; CASE REMANDED TO THAT COURT WITH DIRECTIONS TO VACATE ITS JUDGMENT AND REMAND TO THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR ANNE ARUNDEL COUNTY FOR FURTHER PROCEEDINGS NOT INCONSISTENT WITH THIS OPINION; COSTS IN THIS COURT AND IN THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS TO BE PAID BY ANNE ARUNDEL COUNTY.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-7\">BELL, C.J., joins in judgment only.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b239-9\">.
