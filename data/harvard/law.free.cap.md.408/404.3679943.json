Manck of the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County, for hearing pursuant to Maryland Rule 16-757(c).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Following a hearing, the hearing judge made the following findings of fact and conclusions of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-4\">\u201c[A] letter was sent to the Respondent by Bar Counsel, with an attachment, listing numerous and sundry traffic charges by ticket number and computer print outs of matters in the District Court. (Apparently sent to Bar Counsel by the Office of the States Attorney). In response, Respondent answered by letter stating, \u2018Indeed, every criminal and traffic charge listed on the attachment to your letter has been resolved either by dismissal or by entry of judgment of acquittal.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">\u201cIn fact, there does appear to be two traffic tickets, one involving failure to display or possess a driver\u2019s license, and one dealing with failing to carry a registration card that were not resolved as indicated by Respondent____The Court does not find Respondent knowingly made a false statement of material fact or failed to disclose the facts necessary to correct a misapprehension known by the attorney, pursuant to Rule <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>8.1, Bar Admission and Disciplinary Matters. The Court does believe Respondent when he suggests he forgot about the ticket for failure to carry a registration card in his vehicle ... and when he testified he did not receive a ticket for failing to possess or display a driver\u2019s license in 2004. From the attachment to Bar Counsel\u2019s letter, the Court finds it difficult, if not impossible, to determine the charges or whether, if they are traffic tickets, they had been paid. It is certainly feasible that one would have trouble remembering something as minor as these two tickets. Consequently, the Court does not find Bar Counsel, through clear and convincing evidence, [has] proven those allegations.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\">\u201cThe next allegation ... concerns the obtaining of a driver\u2019s license by Respondent, on or about December 17, 2003, fraudulently, after he knew his license had been confiscated by the police due to an arrest for DWI/DUI.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-6\">\u201cFactually, what occurred was Respondent was approached by a police officer on December 13, 2003 at a sobriety checkpoint. As a result of the police officer detecting the odor of burning marijuana coming from the vehicle, Respondent was asked to pull his vehicle over to the side of the road. The Respondent did not obey the order of the police officer, but rather, turned his lights off and drove into a parking lot. The police officer immediately approached the Respondent and had him voluntarily exit the vehicle. The Respondent was given field sobriety tests which included the horizontal gaze nystagmus test. Interestingly enough, the charges emanating from this incident were those dealing with driving under the influence of controlled dangerous substances, not alcohol.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-7\">\u201cRegardless, the police officer, who the Court finds extremely credible, properly advised the Respondent of his rights under 16-205.1 of the Maryland vehicle law, commonly referred to as the DR-15 and offered him a breath test. This test was refused by the Respondent. The Court finds the DR-15 was read verbatim to Respondent by the police officer. The police officer also read to Respondent, what is commonly referred to as the DR-15A form, which is the officer\u2019s certifi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>cation and order of suspension occasioned by Respondent\u2019s] refusal to take the breath test. Exhibit 9 [the DR-15A Form] also indicates the driver\u2019s license of Respondent was confiscated and explains the Respondent was to use this document as his driver\u2019s license for the following 45 days. The Respondent refused to sign all of those documents]. On December 17, 2003, the Respondent appeared at the Motor Vehicle Administration, requesting a duplicate license. Testimony was had by the individual who helped Respondent on that day to the effect that Respondent indicated his driver\u2019s license had been lost, hence the request for a duplicate....</p>\n<p id=\"b442-4\">\u201cRespondent, in his testimony, indicated that earlier on December 17, 2003, he had been at the mall in Annapolis, at [a] store, and was required to show his license. At that point, he looked in his wallet but could not find his license [sic]. His immediate thoughts on that day were a) he either left his license ... in a law library, b) he had lost same, or c) the police officer had previously taken it.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">\u201cOn cross-examination of the MVA individual, it became clear the Respondent said he did not know where his license was when questioned by the MVA personnel. After a very brief conversation with the person at MVA, and since the computer-generated form only allows certain \u2018drop-downs\u2019 on the computer driven form on the screen to explain a missing license, the witness, not the Respondent^] inserted the word \u2018lost\u2019 into the computer form.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-6\">\u201cThe Respondent ... testified [that] he knew in DUI/DWI cases licenses were taken by police officers and mailed back to the MVA. However, his defense is he was not arrested for DUI or DWI, but rather for a marijuana charge. At no time during his arrest, booking and being held for 15 hours was the license taken from him in his presence nor was he asked to surrender same. The police officer could not recall whether Respondent surrendered the driver\u2019s license or whether he, the police officer, removed it from the Respondent\u2019s wallet sometime after Respondent\u2019s wallet, shoestrings, belt, and personal property were taken' from him prior to booking.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>\u201cOn questioning from the Court, the Respondent did recall obtaining a packet of papers from the police officer ... but stated he threw them on his desk and did not review them for approximately one week, well after his visit to the MVA.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-4\">\u201cThe Court is satisfied with Respondent\u2019s explanation concerning his knowledge of the missing license. Had he reviewed the documents, there would have been no need to obtain a duplicate. The Court is further convinced [that] Respondent was not dishonest nor did he engage in fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation, when he advised the MVA employee he did not know what happened to his license. He did not enter \u2018lost\u2019 on the computer screen and the conversation with the MVA employee concerning what became of his license was truly lacking in substance other than Respondent admitting he was unsure of what became of his license.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-5\">\u201cThe Court ... is satisfied by witnessing the demeanor of the Respondent that he was extremely upset and angry at the stop, arrest, booking and being held for 15 hours to have acted carelessly in his own affairs. Coupling this with his concern about his young daughter being home alone while he was being detained leads the Court to find he did not review the documents given to him by the police officer prior to his visit to the MVA.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-6\">\u201cThe Court finds, as to the license, that Respondent did not violate the [R]ules of [P]rofessional [C]onduct as the Court finds the evidence to be in equal balance; hence, the Petitioner has not, by clear and convincing evidence, proven misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-7\">\u201cThe Complaint by Darryl Q. Short is more problematic. The evidence revealed on May 24, 2005, Mr. Short did retain the Respondent to prepare three separate expungements, two for the District Court and one for the Circuit. Court for which he paid a flat fee of $500.00. The evidence reveals Respondent took the $500.00 and placed it in his escrow account, moving it the very next day via electronic transfer into his personal checking account. Bar Counsel suggests Respondent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>was not entitled to remove the fee the next day as the legal work had not been completed. The Court finds otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-4\">\u201cThe Respondent testified he met with Mr. Short, immediately did research the same day and, in fact, wrote to Mr. Short the same evening[,] sending him the three expungement petitions which he prepared with instructions to Mr. Short on how to file same. He further advised Mr[.] Short he should not file the petitions until his probation terminated, lastly telling him the cost of the filing fee. At that point, on May 24th, the Respondent had done all that was requested and required of him. The Court finds that on May 25, 2005, the fee was earned and the Respondent had the right to transfer it to his personal account[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">We now turn our attention to the petitions for expungement filed by the respondent and his alleged violations of Maryland Rules of Professional Conduct 3.3, Candor Toward the Tribunal, and 8.4, Misconduct. The expungement petitions<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> filed by the respondent in the District Court for Anne Arundel County were pursuant to two separate cases brought against Mr. Short. In District Court Case # 2A00131168, Mr. Short was given a probation before judgment on a charge of Failure to Comply with a Peace Order. In District Court Case # 6A00128379, Mr. Short was given a probation before judgment on a charge of harassment and had charges of both trespass and telephone misuse nolle prossed.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-6\">The hearing judge made the following additional findings of fact and conclusions of law concerning the respondent\u2019s filing of the expungement petitions in Mr. Short\u2019s case: \u201cBar Counsel suggests [that] ... the Respondent [on one of the petitions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>for expungement,] only mentions the nolle prossed trespassing and telephone misuse charges, intentionally omitting the count that resulted in a probation before judgment. Bar Counsel further suggests [that] ... Respondent struck through those portions of the [other] petition for expungement which would have made Mr. Short ineligible for the benefit of expungement of a criminal charge had they not been omitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-5\">\u201cThe evidence reveals that while researching expungement in Criminal Procedure Article] 10-105, Respondent did not review Criminal Procedure Article 10-107 which discusses and explains what type of cases and/or counts can or cannot be expunged. The Respondent was obviously unaware of <em>State v. Nelson, </em>156 Md.App. 558, 847 A.2d 1184 (2004) ... which discusses how multiple charges that are viewed as a single unit cannot be expunged if any one of the unit, for whatever reason, cannot be expunged ... [T]he trespass and telephone misuse had been nolle prossed and standing alone would have been able to be expunged, however, the third charge, in which Mr. Short received a probation before judgment, made all of those charges ineligible for expungement until three years had passed or until a hearing by the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-6\">\u201c[T]he Respondent did in fact draw lines through the following words: \u2018either (a) at least three years have passed since the disposition or\u2019 (b) ... \u2018whichever is later.\u2019 According to Respondent, this was done because he believed the forms that are used statewide do not address the issue of all types of expungement; hence, he did what he believed was the correct thing to do. In addition he believed, incorrectly, that if the expungements were denied, a hearing would automatically be set by the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-7\">\u201cIn his letter to Bar Counsel, Respondent admits he was attempting to \u2018slip by\u2019 these documents in the hope the District Court would grant the expungements. Respondent wrote[,] \u2018After a lengthy discussion with Mr. Short, it was decided that a motion would not be filed in that this would draw the court\u2019s attention to the time requirements of subsec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>tion c and likely result in a denial of the expungements. Indeed, it was hoped that the petitions would \u2018slip through\u2019 and be accepted and processed, anyway, despite the fact they were being filed less than three years from disposition. Consequently, I then prepared the three petitions and mailed them directly to Mr. Short as it was his original intent to file them himself.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b446-4\">\u201cRespondent believed, although negligently and mistakenly, that as to at least [one of the petitions,] the charges could be expunged. He further indicated that as to both [of the petitions,] he believed if the expungement were not allowed the requests would automatically be set for a hearing to determine good cause to grant the relief sought.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">\u201cRespondent was aware of the three year waiting period, which he acknowledged in his letter to Bar Counsel, and which is further evidenced by his striking that wording from the petitions he filed. There is no question that ... these actions were misleading to the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-6\">\u201cRespondent\u2019s actions are a violation of Rule 3.3, Candor Toward the Tribunal and 8.4[ (d) ], Misconduct, [by engaging] in conduct that is prejudicial to the administration of justice, mitigated to some extent by his misunderstanding of the relevant case and statutory law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b446-7\">Both the petitioner and the respondent filed exceptions pursuant to Maryland Rule 16-758.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The petitioner filed an exception to the hearing judge\u2019s conclusion that the respondent\u2019s obtaining of a duplicate driver\u2019s license was not a violation of Rule 8.4. The petitioner also filed a recommendation for sanction, urging the Court to disbar the respondent from the practice of law. The respondent, in turn, filed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>exceptions to both the hearing judge\u2019s findings of fact and conclusions of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-4\">The petitioner asserts that the hearing judge erred when he concluded that the respondent did not violate subsections (b), (c) and (d) of Rule 8.4, \u201cwhen he [the respondent] obtained a duplicate driver\u2019s license four (4) days after his license was confiscated by the police after he had been stopped at a sobriety check-point; failed field sobriety tests; was arrested and refused to take the breathalyser test.\u201d The petitioner argues that the respondent\u2019s attempt to claim ignorance of the fact that his driver\u2019s license had been confiscated after being arrested at a sobriety check-point only four days earlier is disingenuous because of the respondent\u2019s years of experience as an attorney handling DWI/DUI cases. The petitioner contends that the respondent knew that it was standard procedure for an arresting officer to confiscate the license of any individual that refuses a breathalyser test, which was exactly the course of action chosen by the respondent on the night of his arrest. Therefore, the petitioner argues, the respondent obtained a duplicate driver\u2019s license by fraud, thereby violating Rule 8.4(b), (c), and (d).</p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">The petitioner recommends that the respondent be disbarred. That recommendation is based on the conduct it believes to be the fraudulent obtaining of a duplicate driver\u2019s license and also on the respondent\u2019s filing of expungement petitions on behalf of Darryl Q. Short in District Court Case # 2A00131168, conduct which the petitioner characterizes as unethical conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-6\">The respondent has filed two exceptions to the determinations made by the hearing judge. The first exception filed by the respondent maintains that the hearing judge, due to the deficiency of Bar Counsel\u2019s Petition for Disciplinary or Remedial Action (the \u201cPetition\u201d), was precluded from hearing evidence relating to the expungement petition <footnotemark>15</footnotemark> the respondent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>filed on behalf of Mr. Short. According to the respondent, the Petition failed to allege that the respondent engaged in professional misconduct relating to his handling of Mr. Short\u2019s expungement petition in District Court Case # 2A00131168. The respondent contends that the Petition was not \u201csufficiently clear and specific\u201d to inform him of the professional misconduct being alleged against him, thus, violating Maryland Rule 16-751(c).<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The respondent contends that, even if this Court concludes that the Petition did sufficiently allege professional misconduct arising out of his filing of the expungement petition in District Court Case # 2A00131168, he did not violate Rule 3.3 by making any false or misleading statements to the District Court that considered the two expungement petitions he filed on behalf of Mr. Short.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-5\">In reviewing the record, we generally will accept the hearing judge\u2019s findings of fact, unless those findings are clearly erroneous. <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Harris, </em>403 Md. 142, 155-56, 939 A.2d 732, 740 (2008); <em>see also </em>Maryland Rule 16-759(b)(2).<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> \u201cAs to the hearing judge\u2019s conclusions of law, such as whether the provisions of the MRPC were violated, our consideration is essentially <em>de novo.\u201d Harris, </em>403 Md. at 156, 939 A.2d at 740. <em>See also </em>Maryland <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>Rule 16 \u2014 759(b)(1).<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> If the hearing judge\u2019s factual findings are not clearly erroneous and the conclusions drawn from them are supported by the facts found, exceptions to conclusions of law will be overruled. <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Goff, </em>399 Md. 1, 27, 922 A.2d 554, 569 (2007); <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Mba-Jonas, </em>397 Md. 690, 700, 919 A.2d 669, 675 (2007); <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Manger, </em>396 Md. 134, 146-47, 913 A.2d 1, 8 (2006). Moreover, a hearing judge\u2019s findings of fact will not be overruled unless we determine that those findings are clearly erroneous. <em>Goff, </em>399 Md. at 28, 922 A.2d at 570; <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Mahone, </em>398 Md. 257, 265, 920 A.2d 458, 463; <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n, v. Guida, </em>391 Md. 33, 50, 891 A.2d 1085, 1095 (2006). The hearing judge is appropriately responsible for, and charged with, \u201c \u2018[wjeighing the credibility of witnesses and resolving any conflict in the evidence^]\u2019 \u201d <em>Goff, </em>399 Md. at 28, 922 A.2d at 570 <em>(quoting State v. Stanley, </em>351 Md. 733, 750, 720 A.2d 323, 331 (1998)).</p>\n<p id=\"b449-4\">After a review of the record, therefore, we shall overrule the petitioner\u2019s exception and both of the respondent\u2019s exceptions. We conclude that the hearing judge\u2019s findings of fact were not clearly erroneous and his resulting conclusions are supported by those facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">We begin our analysis by addressing the petitioner\u2019s exception. The petitioner takes exception to the hearing judge\u2019s conclusion that the respondent did not violate Rule 8.4 by obtaining a duplicate driver\u2019s license after his DWI/DUI arrest. The hearing judge stated that he was \u201csatisfied by witnessing the demeanor of the Respondent\u201d that the traffic stop and the respondent\u2019s subsequent arrest caused him to act \u201ccarelessly in his own affairs.\u201d Indeed, he observed, the respondent\u2019s young daughter was home alone on the night of his arrest, which likely further distracted the respondent from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>focusing on the information that the arresting officer conveyed to him that night. The hearing judge also found the respondent credible when he testified that he did not review the documents, specifically the DR-15A Form, given to him by the arresting officer until one week after he had obtained a duplicate driver\u2019s license from the MVA. The hearing judge likewise was convinced that the respondent was not being dishonest or deceitful when he told the MVA employee that he did not know where his license was. While this Court might not have accepted such an explanation from an experienced attorney such as the respondent, \u201cdeference to the hearing judge\u2019s findings\u201d is required because he is \u201cin the best position to assess the credibility of a witness.\u201d <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Pak, </em>400 Md. 567, 595, 929 A.2d 546, 562-63 (2007); Maryland Rule 16-759(b)(2)(B). Undoubtedly, the hearing judge had the best opportunity to evaluate the veracity of the respondent\u2019s explanation concerning his request for a duplicate driver\u2019s license from the MVA. As the hearing judge\u2019s factual findings are not clearly erroneous, we overrule the petitioner\u2019s exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-4\">The respondent\u2019s first exception is that the hearing judge was precluded from considering any testimony involving the respondent\u2019s alleged misconduct that involved his filing of the expungement petition in District Court Case # 2A00131168. The respondent alleges that the Petition failed to include any \u201callegations of misconduct [by the respondent] concerning Case # 2A00131168.\u201d The respondent asserts that this deficiency in the Petition violated Maryland Rule 16-751(c), precluding the hearing judge from considering any evidence of alleged professional misconduct related to the respondent\u2019s handling of Mr. Short\u2019s expungement petition in District Court Case # 2A00131168.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-5\">After reviewing the entire Petition, it is sufficiently clear to us that it alleged that the respondent engaged in professional misconduct in his handling of Mr. Short\u2019s ex-pungement petition in District Court Case # 2A00131168. A Petition will be deemed sufficient \u201c[s]o long as the petition <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>informs the attorney of the misconduct charged in language which is clear and sufficiently specific to enable the attorney to prepare a defense.\u201d <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Fezell, </em>361 Md. 234, 247, 760 A.2d 1108, 1115 (2000) <em>(citing Bar Ass\u2019n v. Cockrell, </em>270 Md. 686, 692, 313 A.2d 816, 819 (1974)). We have made it clear that no specific form or detail is required to satisfy this threshold requirement. <em>Id. </em>The Petition stated the following, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b451-4\">\u201c16. That on or about May 24, 2005, Darryl Q. Short retained the Respondent [Mr. Louis P. Tanko] to file three (3) expungements and paid a $500.00 flat fee.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b451-5\">\u201c17.

That Mr. Short\u2019s probation before judgment in the District Court matters were entered on June 15, 2005.

The Respondent admitted to the Attorney Grievance Commission that he decided not to file a Motion for Good Cause to Expunge Mr. Short\u2019s Records early because it would draw the Court\u2019s attention to the time requirements and likely result in a denial of the expungements. The Respondent stated that he hoped that the Petitions would slip through and be accepted and processed, despite the fact that they were being filed less than three years of [sic] disposition.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b451-9\">\u201c21. In Case Numbers 6A00128379 and 2A00131168 the Respondent filed the Petitions for Expungement of Records in the District Court for Maryland on behalf of Mr. Short <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>however failed to submit the general waiver and release with those expungements.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b452-4\">Paragraph number twenty-four in the Petition alleges that the respondent admitted to the Commission that the Clerks in Anne Arundel County\u2019s Circuit Court, on three separate occasions, refused to accept the expungement petition that the respondent attempted to file on Mr. Short\u2019s behalf, because it had not been three years since the entry of probation before judgment in Mr. Short\u2019s Circuit Court matter. Thus, the expungement petition for Mr. Short\u2019s Circuit Court matter was not filed by the respondent, leaving only two other expungement petitions on behalf of Mr. Short. Both of those expungement petitions were filed in the District Court. The Petition, in paragraphs number twenty and twenty one, makes clear that the Commission was concerned only about the expungement petitions that actually had been \u201cfiled\u201d by the respondent on Mr. Short\u2019s behalf. If the respondent still was confused about the thrust of the allegations being made by the Commission, paragraph number twenty three, combined with all of the previous allegations in the complaint, should have clarified any ambiguity:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b452-5\">\u201c23. After the releases were submitted to the District Court with the Petitions for Expungement of Records, <em>both expungements were granted even though three years had not passed since the entry of probation before judgments.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b452-6\">Indeed, the respondent\u2019s own letter to the Commission, the substance of it is summarized in paragraph number twenty, indicates that he understood that the Commission was alleging professional misconduct in his handling of Mr. Short\u2019s ex-pungement petition in District Court Case #2A00131168. The Petition, albeit perhaps not a model of clarity, outlined the fact that the respondent was unsuccessful in filing the one expungement petition that Mr. Short wanted filed in the Circuit Court following his being sentenced to probation before judgment on a malicious destruction of property conviction. In fact, the Petition indicates, and the respondent admitted, that clerks for Anne Arundel County\u2019s Circuit Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>refused to allow the respondent to file that particular ex-pungement petition on three separate occasions because three years had not elapsed since the entry of the judgment of probation before judgment. When the Petition is viewed as a whole and a modicum of common sense is applied, the substance of the Petition\u2019s allegations is more than clear enough to surpass the minimal hurdle created by Maryland Rule 16-751(c). Therefore, we overrule the respondent\u2019s exception and conclude that the hearing judge was correct in taking testimony about the respondent\u2019s possible misconduct related to his handling of the expungement petition in District Court Case # 2A00131168.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-4\">The respondent takes exception to the hearing judge\u2019s conclusion that he violated Maryland Rule of Professional Conduct 3.3. The respondent contends that there was not enough evidence in the record to support such a finding. We disagree. Rule 3.3 states the following, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-5\">\u201c(a) A lawyer shall not knowingly:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-6\">(1) make a false statement of fact or law to a tribunal or fail to correct a false statement of material fact or law previously made to the tribunal by the lawyer;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-7\">(2) fail to disclose a material fact to a tribunal when disclosure is necessaiy to avoid assisting a criminal or fraudulent act by the client;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-8\">(3) fail to disclose to the tribunal legal authority in the controlling jurisdiction known to the lawyer to be directly adverse to the position of the client and not disclosed by opposing counsel; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-9\">(4) offer evidence that the lawyer knows to be false. If a lawyer has offered material evidence and comes to know of its falsity, the lawyer shall take reasonable remedial measures.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b453-10\">The hearing judge concluded that the respondent violated Rule 3.3(a) by misleading the District Court that reviewed the two expungement petitions filed on behalf of Mr. Short. Based on our review of the facts, the hearing judge\u2019s findings and conclusion must be upheld. The respondent, on three <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>separate occasions, unsuccessfully attempted to file an ex-pungement petition on Mr. Short\u2019s behalf in the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County. On each occasion, clerks for the Circuit Court refused to accept the expungement petition because three years had not yet elapsed since the entry of a judgment of probation before judgment on Mr. Short\u2019s malicious destruction count. The respondent, however, nevertheless filed two separate expungement petitions in the District Court, even though those petitions also were ineligible. The hearing judge found that the respondent, while conducting his legal research on this matter, failed to review Maryland Code (2001, 2004 Supp.) \u00a7 10-107 of the Criminal Procedure Article which discusses the types of counts that can be expunged. Furthermore, the hearing judge found that the respondent was unaware of <em>State v. Nelson, </em>156 Md.App. 558, 847 A.2d 1184 (2004), which held that multiple charges are viewed as a single unit and cannot be expunged if any charge within that unit, for whatever reason, cannot be expunged. The facts also revealed that the respondent drew lines through the following words on the two expungement forms filed in the District Court: \u201ceither (a) at least three years have passed since the disposition or\u201d (b) \u201cwhichever is later.\u201d The respondent hoped these ineligible petitions would \u201cslip through\u201d and avoid detection by the District Court. We agree with the hearing judge\u2019s conclusion that the respondent\u2019s actions, taken as a whole, misled the District Court and constituted a violation of Rule 3.3(a). Thus, we shall overrule the respondent\u2019s exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-4\">The only matter left to determine is the appropriate sanction. The goal of attorney discipline is to protect the public, as opposed to punishing the erring attorney, and to reaffirm the public\u2019s confidence in the legal profession. <em>See Goff, </em>399 Md. at 30-31, 922 A.2d at 571; <em>Mba-Jonas, </em>397 Md. at 703, 919 A.2d at 677; <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Rees, </em>396 Md. 248, 254, 913 A.2d 68, 72 (2006); <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Kreamer, </em>387 Md. 503, 534, 876 A.2d 79, 97-98 (2005). When imposing sanctions, our goal is to impose a sanction that is commensurate with the nature and gravity of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>the violations and the intent with which they were committed. <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Awuah, </em>346 Md. 420, 435, 697 A.2d 446, 454 (1997); <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Glenn, </em>341 Md. 448, 483, 671 A.2d 463, 480 (1996); <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Myers, </em>333 Md. 440, 447, 635 A.2d 1315, 1318 (1994). Certainly, appropriate sanctions serve as a deterrent, <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Sliffman, </em>330 Md. 515, 529, 625 A.2d 314, 321 (1993); <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Berger, </em>326 Md. 129, 131, 604 A.2d 58 (1992) <em>(citing Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Owrutsky, </em>322 Md. 334, 355, 587 A.2d 511, 521 (1991)), protect the integrity of the legal profession, <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Cassidy, </em>362 Md. 689, 698, 766 A.2d 632, 637 (2001) and further the public\u2019s confidence in it. <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Christopher, </em>383 Md. 624, 639, 861 A.2d 692, 701 (2004); <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Stein, </em>373 Md. 531, 533, 819 A.2d 372, 373 (2003); <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Powell, </em>369 Md. 462, 474, 800 A.2d 782, 789 (2002). In crafting an appropriate sanction, however, we also must consider the facts and circumstances of each particular case, including any mitigating factors. <em>See Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Atkinson, </em>357 Md. 646, 656, 745 A.2d 1086, 1092 (2000); <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Gavin, </em>350 Md. 176, 197-98, 711 A.2d 193, 204 (1998). Given the importance we place on maintaining the public\u2019s confidence, \u201cthe attorney\u2019s prior grievance history ... the attorney\u2019s remorse for the misconduct, and the likelihood of the conduct being repeated\u201d also are relevant considerations. <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Post, </em>379 Md. 60, 71, 839 A.2d 718, 724-25 (2003). As to the latter consideration, the likelihood of repetition, we have recognized that conduct, although an aberration, can be so egregious as to warrant the imposition of a significant sanction. <em>See Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n, v. Franz, </em>355 Md. 752, 762, 736 A.2d 339, 344 (1999)(offering <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Protokowicz, </em>329 Md. 252, 263, 619 A.2d 100, 105 (1993) as an example of such conduct).</p>\n<p id=\"b455-4\">As the hearing judge found, the petitioner filed ex-pungement petitions for charges ineligible for expungement in an attempt to have the petitions \u201cslip by\u201d the court and be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>granted. Further, the hearing judge found that the respondent was aware of the three-year waiting period \u2014 this was evidenced by his acknowledgment to that effect in a letter to Bar Counsel, as well as by his striking certain wording in the petitions he filed \u2014 and that his actions in this regard were misleading to the District Court. While the respondent\u2019s actions were indeed misleading and, to a lesser degree, negligent, his actions do not rise to the level necessitating disbarment. <em>See Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Vanderlinde, </em>364 Md. 376, 418, 773 A.2d 463, 488 (dishonest \u2014 perjurious and fraudulent \u2014 conduct ordinarily should result in disbarment). And when we consider, in mitigation, the respondent\u2019s lack of any prior disciplinary action and, as stated by the hearing judge, \u201chis misunderstanding of the relevant case and statutory law[,]\u201d the appropriate sanction in this case is a sixty day suspension.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-4\">IT IS SO ORDERED; RESPONDENT SHALL PAY ALL COSTS AS TAXED BY THE CLERK OF THIS COURT, INCLUDING COSTS OF ALL TRANSCRIPTS, PURSUANT TO MARYLAND RULE 16-761, FOR WHICH SUM JUDGMENT IS ENTERED IN FAVOR OF THE ATTORNEY GRIEVANCE COMMISSION AGAINST LOUIS PETER TANKO, JR.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b438-6\">.
