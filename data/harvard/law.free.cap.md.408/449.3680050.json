Byrd, Respondent. Bar Counsel charged Respondent with violating the following Maryland Rules of Professional Conduct (\u201cMRPC\u201d): 1.1 (Competence),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> 1.3 (Diligence),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> 1.4(a)(2) (Communication),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> 3.1 (Meritorious Claims and Contentions),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> 3.2 (Expediting Litigation),<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> 3.3(a)(1) (Candor Toward the Tribunal),<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> 3.4(c) and (d) (Fair<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>ness to Opposing Party and Counsel),<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and 8.4(b), (c) and (d) (Misconduct).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">Pursuant to Maryland Rule 16-752(a),<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> we referred the petition to the Honorable Ronald B. Rubin of the Circuit Court for Montgomery County, for an evidentiary hearing and to make findings of fact and conclusions of law. Judge Rubin held a two-day hearing commencing on July 31, 2008. On August 26, 2008, he issued a Memorandum Opinion, pursuant to Maryland Rule 16-757(c).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Judge Rubin found by clear <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>and convincing evidence that Respondent violated MRPC 1.1, 1.3, 1.4(a)(2), 3.1, 3.3(a)(1), 3.4(c), and 8.4(b)-(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b485-4\">The Complaints</p>\n<p id=\"b485-5\">The charged violations were brought under three complaints. The first of them (\u201cthe Jams complaint\u201d), was filed by Gary M. Janis, Esquire, an attorney with Peroutka &amp; Peroutka, P.A., and relates to Respondent\u2019s involvement in a number of the firm\u2019s collection cases. The other two complaints, filed by Bar Counsel, stem from two unrelated matters: Respondent\u2019s involvement in another case with the Peroutka firm, the <em>Ziegler </em>case, and Respondent\u2019s conduct during a bankruptcy proceeding (\u201cthe bankruptcy complaint\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b485-6\">Judge Rubin found that the charges related to the complaint concerning the <em>Ziegler </em>case were not proven by clear and convincing evidence. Petitioner has not filed exceptions to those findings, so we shall not further address those charges. Judge Rubin\u2019s findings of fact and conclusions of law regarding the remainder of the charges follow.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-7\">Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law</p>\n<p id=\"b485-8\">By way of background, Judge Rubin found that Respondent was admitted to the bar of the State of New York in 1980, and to the bar of the State of Maryland in 1992. He served from 1986 to 1992 as an Associate General Counsel in the Office of the Comptroller for the State of New York. Then, in 1992, Respondent began a sole practice in Maryland, focusing initially on federal civil rights claims, employment discrimination claims, and tort actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-9\">In 1998, Respondent began to shift his practice to debtors\u2019 rights under state law. In that regard, Judge Rubin wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ArO\">Byrd elected to pursue this area because he was getting sued by creditors and, as a result of defending his own case, learned defenses available in credit card cases. In particular, Byrd began to develop defenses under the provisions of the Maryland Commercial Code regarding retail credit accounts. Md. Commercial Law Article \u00a7\u00a7 12-501, <em>et. seq. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>(2005 Rep. Vol.). <em>See Jackson v. Pasadena Receivables, Inc., </em>398 Md. 611 [921 A.2d 799] (2007).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b486-4\">Judge Rubin\u2019s complaint-specific findings of fact and conclusions of law followed. We quote those findings and conclusions, and include the numbered paragraphs associated with them for ease of reference later in this opinion. Judge Rubin began with the Janis complaint:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-5\">5. On September 28, 2006, Gary M. Janis, an attorney with Peroutka &amp; Peroutka, P.A. (the \u201cPeroutka firm\u201d) filed a complaint against Byrd. The Peroutka firm specializes in filing collection cases, mostly on behalf of credit card companies or firms that have purchased debt from credit card companies, in the District Courts of Maryland. The complaint alleged numerous acts of misconduct by Byrd arising out of Byrd\u2019s representation of debtor defendants in District Court cases.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-6\">6. Byrd testified at the hearing that, over time, he represented the majority of debtors sued by the Peroutka firm and became \u201cquite a thorn in their side.\u201d With respect to the matters discussed below, Byrd claimed that he first learned of the problems when contacted by Bar Counsel and that the Peroutka firm never complained to him directly.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AKX\">The court finds Byrd to be credible in this regard.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-8\">7. Byrd entered his appearance in the <em>Mebane </em>collection case in the District Court for Prince George\u2019s County on March 10, 2006. Trial was set for March 29, 2006. On March 10, 200[6], Byrd moved for a continuance due to a scheduling conflict. The continuance was not granted and, when neither Byrd nor the defendant appeared for trial, the District Court entered a default judgment. The District Court vacated the default judgment on May 24, 200[6]. Byrd testified at the hearing that he simply \u201cassumed\u201d that a continuance would be granted because he had a conflict.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-9\">8. On June 23, 2006, in the <em>Hooker </em>case pending in the District Court for Prince George\u2019s County, Byrd filed a motion to reconsider the denial of a motion quashing a subpoena. The hearing on the motion was scheduled for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>August 18, 2006. Byrd did not appear for the hearing. Opposing counsel appeared and the motion was denied. Byrd\u2019s explanation, which this court does not find to be credible, is that he believed that the hearing had been cancelled.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-4\">9. Byrd appeared in the <em>Honsberger </em>case in the District Court for Baltimore County on May 3, 2006, and both sides requested a continuance. The trial was postponed until July 6, 2006. Byrd appeared for trial on July 6, 2006 and requested another continuance, stating that he had been unable to reach his client. Byrd told the District Court that the last time he had spoken with his client the client had said that she was going out of town for the 4th of July holiday. The court denied the motion, the case was heard, and judgment was entered against Byrd\u2019s client. Byrd later liled a motion for a new trial, accompanied by an affidavit from the client, in which the client stated that Byrd had not informed her of the July 2006 trial date. The new trial motion was denied. The court finds that Byrd, contrary to his representation to the District Court, did not inform his client of the July 2006 trial date.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-5\">10. On June 12, 2006, Byrd filed a motion to continue the <em>Respass </em>case, which was set for trial in the District Court for Prince George\u2019s County on July 16, 2006. The case was continued on June 15, 2006, but Byrd did not serve counsel for the plaintiff with a copy of his continuance motion. On August 4, 2006, the court in the <em>Respass </em>case ordered Byrd to file supplemental interrogatory answers by August 22, 2006. The certificate of service signed by Byrd stated that the supplemental answers were mailed on August 22, 2006. However, the postmark on the envelope disclosed that they were not mailed until August 26, 2006. The court finds that Byrd did not mail the supplemental interrogatory answers until April 25, 2006, at the earliest.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-6\">11. Byrd filed an appeal in the <em>Harvey </em>case in Prince George\u2019s County. A trial <em>de novo </em>was set for April 14, 2006. Byrd withdrew the appeal and purported to mail the notice on April 10, 2006. Counsel for the plaintiff did not receive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>Byrd\u2019s notice before the date set for the appeal and appeared at the courthouse. When she returned to her office, Byrd\u2019s notice was on her desk, with a United States postmark of April 13, 2006. The court finds that Byrd did not mail the notice withdrawing the appeal on April 10, 2006, as he represented in his certificate of service.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-4\">12. In the <em>Sy </em>case in the District Court for Prince George\u2019s County, the court granted the plaintiffs motion to compel complete interrogatory answers and ordered Byrd to file complete answers. Byrd did not do so and, on May 10, 2006, the plaintiff moved for sanctions.' On May 26, 2006, Byrd provided interrogatory answers, but they were not under oath, as required by Maryland Rule 3 \u2014 421(d).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-5\">13. In the <em>Faulkner </em>case in the District Court for Prince George\u2019s County, the plaintiff served interrogatories on February 21, 2006. Byrd did not respond, and the plaintiff moved to compel on March 13, 2006. The court ordered Byrd to file answers by April 15, 2006. When Byrd did not comply with the court\u2019s order, the plaintiff moved for sanctions on April 18, 2006. On April 20, 2006, Byrd filed interrogatory answers that were not under oath. In open court on April 21, 2006, Byrd agreed to provide supplemental answers by May 5, 2006. On May 13, 2006, Byrd mailed interrogatory answers to the plaintiff that were not under oath. At the hearing before this court, Byrd defended his conduct in the <em>Sy </em>and <em>Faulkner </em>cases by claiming that the Peroutka firm was \u201cplaying games\u201d with discovery. The court finds Byrd\u2019s explanation for his failure to follow the Maryland Rules not to be credible.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-6\">14. In the <em>Kaplan </em>case in the District Court for Montgomery County, Byrd entered his appearance after judgment had been entered against the client. On September 15, 2006, Byrd moved to vacate the judgment, which was denied. On October 10, 2006, Byrd moved for reconsideration of the motion to vacate, which was also denied. Byrd then filed an appeal on November 29, 2006. The appeal was dismissed on December 1, 2006, as untimely.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b489-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>Judge Rubin came to the following conclusions of law regarding the Janis complaint:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-4\">15. The court is mindful of the hectic pace of practice before the District Courts and that, as a practical matter, honest mistakes are made, perhaps even with some regularity. Nevertheless, in the <em>Mebane </em>case, Byrd violated Rules 1.1 and 1.3 when, without an adequate reason, he failed to appear for a scheduled trial. <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Harris, </em>366 Md. 376, 403 [784 A.2d 516] (2001). <em>See also Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Harris, </em>371 Md. 510, 545-M8 [810 A.2d 457] (2002); <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Ficker, </em>319 Md. 305, 315 [572 A.2d 501] (1990). Although a motion for continuance had been filed, it had not been granted. The granting of a continuance is in the hands of the court, not counsel. Byrd\u2019s failure to appear for the motions hearing in the <em>Hooker </em>case, without a cogent explanation, also violated Rule 1.1 and 1.3. <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Ober, </em>350 Md. 616, 629-30 [714 A.2d 856] (1998).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-5\">16. Byrd\u2019s conduct in the <em>Honsberger </em>case is disturbing. He did not notify his client of the trial date. His excuses at the hearing before this court were neither consistent nor credible. Such conduct, at a minimum, violates Rule 1.4(a)(2). <em>See Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Rose, </em>391 Md. 101, 110-11 [892 A.2d 469] (2006). <em>See also Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Kreamer, </em>404 Md. 282 [946 A.2d 500] (2008).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-6\">17. Byrd\u2019s repeated failures to mail documents on the dates represented in the certificates of service in the <em>Respetas </em>and <em>Harvey </em>cases violated Rule 3.3(a)(1), as the representations as to mailing were false and his failure to timely mail documents affected the handling of the cases by opposing counsel.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-7\">18. Byrd\u2019s failures to serve interrogatory answers under oath in <em>Sy </em>and <em>Faulkner </em>violated Rule 1.1. His filing of an untimely appeal in the <em>Kaplan </em>case violated Rule 1.1 as well.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-8\">19. Standing alone, none of these matters likely would warrant serious disciplinary action. But when the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>reviews the facts of the case as a whole, the court is convinced that Byrd\u2019s conduct evidences a regular, intentional disregard of the Maryland Rules in his handling of debt collection cases, a disregard that is not countenanced simply because the Petrouka firm may have been playing \u201chardball\u201d with Byrd\u2019s clients. If opposing counsel is engaging in discovery conduct which the attorney believes is improper, counsel should meet and confer to attempt in good faith to resolve the issues. <em>See Rodriguez v. Clarke, </em>400 Md. 39, 61-64 [926 A.2d 736] (2007). If no resolution is obtained, resort may be had to the trial judge or, if necessary, to the administrative judge. But under no circumstances can counsel simply violate the Rules as a litigation strategy.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b490-4\">With regard to the bankruptcy complaint, Judge Rubin made the following pertinent findings of fact and conclusions of law:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-5\">23. On December 14, 2001, Platinum Financial Services Corporation (\u201cPlatinum Financial\u201d), one of Byrd\u2019s creditors, filed an involuntary bankruptcy petition under Chapter 7 of the federal Bankruptcy Code. The Bankruptcy Code permits a single creditor to file an involuntary petition as long as: (1) the debtor has fewer than twelve creditors; and (2) the creditor filing the petition holds claims totaling more than $11,625 that are not subject to a bona fide dispute. 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 303(b). Platinum Financial had final judgments against Byrd of over $32,000.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-6\">24. Platinum Financial is controlled by principals of Wolpof &amp; Abramson, a collections law firm with whom Byrd had clashed. On December 5, 2001; nine days before the involuntary Chapter 7 proceeding was filed, Byrd filed a class action against Platinum Financial in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-7\">25. Upon the filing of the Chapter 7 petition, the bankruptcy court appointed Roger Schlossberg, Esquire, as the Chapter 7 Trustee. Mr. Schlossberg retained as his counsel James M. Hoffman, Esquire, of Shulman, Rogers, Gandal, Pordy &amp; Ecker, P.A.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>26. On July 24, 2002, Byrd appealed the institution of the Chapter 7 proceeding to the district court, which vacated the action. The Trustee appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit. The district court, by Order entered on March 27, 2003, stayed the dismissal of the Chapter 7 case pending appellate review. On February 11, 2004, by a published opinion, the Fourth Circuit reversed the district court\u2019s dismissal of the Chapter 7 proceeding, and remanded the case for further proceedings in the bankruptcy court. <em>In re Byrd, </em>357 F.3d 433 (4th Cir.2004).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-5\">27. After remand to the bankruptcy court, Byrd converted his Chapter 7 liquidation case to a case under Chapter 11 reorganization. However, in the exercise of its discretion, the bankruptcy court appointed a Trustee, rather than allow Byrd to control the estate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-6\">28. The bankruptcy court had good reason to appoint a Trustee, even though the case had been converted to a reorganization under Chapter 11. For example, on December 18, 2002, the bankruptcy court ordered Byrd to permit the Trustee and the Trustee\u2019s attorney to have complete access to the property and its improvements. Byrd did not do so.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-7\">29. As a consequence, on January 24, 2004, the bankruptcy court found Byrd in contempt and, again, ordered Byrd to allow access to the property.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>30. The original Trustee, Roger Schlossberg, declined to continue to serve, so on July 23, 2004, the bankruptcy court appointed Gregory Johnson, Esquire, to act as Trustee.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-5\">31. Johnson testified at the hearing in this case. Johnson is very experienced in bankruptcy matters, having been appointed as a trustee by the bankruptcy court in many cases since 1986. Given the state of the case, Johnson had a sense of urgency because Byrd had failed to attend a meeting of creditors, was not returning Johnson\u2019s calls and had failed to cooperate with the prior Trustee. Johnson attempted to seek Byrd\u2019s cooperation on several occasions, but was not successful. The court finds Johnson\u2019s testimony regarding his efforts to work with Byrd to achieve an orderly administration of the estate to be credible. The court also -finds that Johnson is an accurate reporter of events.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-6\">32. The principal asset of the estate was Byrd\u2019s real property in Laytonsville, Maryland, consisting of a residence and eleven acres of farmland. As a consequence of Byrd\u2019s repeated failures to cooperate, on August 25, 2004, Johnson filed a motion for a Writ of Assistance from the United States Marshal.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-7\">33. On September 15, 2004, the bankruptcy court granted Johnson\u2019s motion and ordered Byrd to allow access to the property on twenty-four hour telephonic notice.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-8\">34. Johnson attempted to call Byrd on September 21, 2004, but Byrd did not answer his telephone.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-9\">35. On September 24, 2004, Johnson and a potential buyer went to the property but could not gain access because the gate was locked and a car blocked the entrance to the driveway. Johnson attempted to call Byrd, but Byrd did not answer his telephone.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-10\">36. On September 24, 2004, Johnson filed another motion in the bankruptcy court requesting to be [sic] Byrd compelled [sic] to grant him access to the property.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-11\">37. On October 7, 2004, the bankruptcy court entered an order compelling Byrd to allow Johnson access to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>property and issued a Writ of Assistance. The court found that Byrd had failed to comply with the court\u2019s prior orders regarding the property.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-4\">88. On November 11, 2004, Byrd\u2019s wife, a co-owner of the property, filed a petition under Chapter 13 of the Bankruptcy Code, which had the effect of staying Johnson\u2019s efforts to sell the property.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-5\">39. On January 13, 2006, the bankruptcy court consolidated Byrd\u2019s case with that of his wife. On January 30, 2006, the court denied confirmation of Byrd\u2019s proposed plan of reorganization under Chapter 11, and converted the case to a Chapter 7 liquidation. Johnson was appointed as the Chapter 7 trustee.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-6\">40. On April 19, 2006, Hoffman, as counsel to the trustee, wrote to Byrd and advised him of the trustee\u2019s intention to sell the property and requested that Byrd vacate the premises within thirty days. Byrd refused to vacate the premises.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-7\">41. On September 16, 2006, Hoffman again wrote to Byrd and requested that Byrd vacate the property by October 15, 2006. Again, Byrd refused.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-8\">42. On September 18, 2006, Johnson filed a motion to authorize the removal of Byrd from the property. The court held a hearing on December 1, 2006 and, on December 11, 2006, ordered that Byrd vacate the premises by January 31, 2007. Byrd did not obey the court\u2019s order.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-9\">43. Hoffman testified at the hearing regarding his efforts to work with Byrd regarding access to and the sale of property. The court finds Hoffman\u2019s testimony to be credible, accurate, and reliable.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-10\">44. The court does not find Byrd\u2019s testimony regarding access to and the sale of the property to be credible.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-11\">45. Under the Bankruptcy Code, Byrd was required to file monthly reports that set forth his income, expenses, opening balance and closing balance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-12\">46. Byrd did not file accurate or complete reports. Byrd did not provide timely or accurate information to Johnson, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>or provide supporting bank statements, despite a court order requiring him to do so.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-4\">47. The court finds that Byrd\u2019s reports to the bankruptcy court were false, and that Byrd knew they were false when he filed the reports.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-5\">48. U.S.C. \u00a7 1001 makes it a crime to falsify or conceal a material fact, or to make a false statement or provide a false document to the government or a government agent. <em>Brogan v. United States, </em>522 U.S. 398 [118 S.Ct. 805, 139 L.Ed.2d 830] (1998). 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1621 prohibits perjury. <em>Bronston v. United States, </em>409 Md.[U.S.] 352[, 93 S.Ct. 595, 34 L.Ed.2d 568] (1973).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-6\">49. Hoffman testified extensively on the subject of Byrd\u2019s business reports and prepared a comparison of Byrd\u2019s reports with bank records Hoffman ultimately obtained. The court finds Hoffman\u2019s testimony regarding the falsity of Byrd\u2019s reports to be highly credible.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-7\">50. On April 19, 2006, Hoffman, on behalf of the Trustee, wrote to Byrd requesting financial information. Byrd did not respond to this letter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-8\">51. On May 8, 2006, Hoffman again wrote to Byrd requesting financial information and reminding Byrd of the prior request. Again, Byrd did not respond to the request.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-9\">52. On June 16, 2006, Hoffman wrote to Byrd for a third time, requesting financial information, and advising Byrd that the information would be needed fourteen days before the meeting of creditors.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-10\">53. When no response was received, Hoffman wrote again on September 15,2006. Byrd did not respond.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-11\">54. On October 24, 2006, the Trustee filed a motion to compel Byrd to produce documents and financial information. The bankruptcy court held a hearing on December 1, 2006.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-12\">55. On December 8, 2006, the court ordered Byrd to produce financial information, including all bank statements for the period December 14, 2001 through January 31, 2006.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>56. Byrd wrote to Hoffman on January 30, 2007, stating that he did not have any of the requested records. According to Byrd, they were \u201clost\u201d when he moved from the Laytonsville property.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-4\">57. On February 15, 2007, the Trustee filed a motion to hold Byrd in contempt, and for monetary sanctions, for failing to produce the requested financial information. A hearing was set for April 2, 2007.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-5\">58. On the morning of the hearing, Byrd produced some bank records, cancelled checks and his 2005 federal income tax return. The hearing was postponed until April 25, 2007, to give the Trustee time to review the documents.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-6\">59. The bankruptcy court held a hearing on April 25, 2007. On September 27, 2007, the bankruptcy court held Byrd in contempt for failing to produce documents and awarded sanctions. Under the Bankruptcy Code, the debtor is obligated to cooperate with the Trustee, and to surrender to the Trustee all property of the estate and all documents relating to the property of the estate. 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 521(a)(3) &amp; (4). The bankruptcy court specifically found that Byrd\u2019s \u201cobjections were without merit and filed for purposes of delay.\u201d The bankruptcy court also found that Byrd and his wife \u201chad no just cause for their refusal to provide the documents and information to the Trustee in response to his letters, or for their failure to comply with the Production Order.\u201d Sanctions were awarded because the \u201crecord here establishes a continuous, ongoing effort by the Debtors to frustrate the Trustee\u2019s administration of the estate. The Debtors have turned a request for documents by the Trustee into a costly, year-long charade.\u201d The bankruptcy court also found that Byrd \u201coffered no plausible explanation for fhis] failure to produce the information.\u201d Finally, the court found that Byrd\u2019s conduct was \u201cwillful.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-7\">60. The court denied Byrd a discharge in bankruptcy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-8\">61. After a hearing, on April 23, 2007, the bankruptcy court ruled from the bench that the Trustee could sell Byrd\u2019s residence. An order to this effect was entered by the court on April 25, 2007. The bankruptcy court author<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>ized the Trustee to sell the property \u201cfree and clear of all liens, claims, interests and encumbrances.\u201d 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 363(f).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b496-5\">62. On April 23, 2007, shortly before the hearing on the Trustee\u2019s motion to sell the house, Byrd filed a lawsuit in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County requesting, among other things, that the state court impose a constructive trust on the residence that was part of the bankruptcy estate. Among others, Byrd named as defendants the current Trustee (Johnson), the former Trustee (Schlossberg), counsel to the Trustee (Hoffman), counsel\u2019s law firm (Shulman Rogers), Bar Counsel and an investigator for the Attorney Grievance Commission.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Byrd filed an amended complaint in state court on May 2, 2007, seeking the same relief.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b496-7\">63. On May 7, 2007,- the Trustee filed an emergency motion requesting Byrd to be held in contempt for violating the automatic stay (11 U.S.C. \u00a7 362(a)) and for other relief. Byrd argued in response that the mere filing of the state court complaint against the Trustee, without actual service of process, did not violate the automatic stay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b496-8\">64. On May 18, 2007, the bankruptcy court granted the motion and entered an order enjoining Byrd \u201cfrom filing, pursuing or maintaining any action in state or federal court, seeking to obtain possession, custody or control of or any interest in\u201d the Laytonsville Property. The court further enjoined Byrd \u201cfrom taking any other action, including but not limited to filing a lis pendens against the Property----\u201d The court also enjoined Byrd \u201cfrom filing, pursuing or maintaining any action in state or federal court seeking any remedy against the Trustee, Mr. Roger Schlossberg, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>initial Chapter 7[T]rustee .... and Shulman Rogers .... without first seeking and obtaining leave of this Court.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b497-4\">65. Nevertheless, on May 29, 2007, after the issuance of the bankruptcy court\u2019s injunction, Byrd filed a second amended complaint in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County. In this second amended complaint, Byrd incorporated all of the allegations set forth in the May 2, 2007 complaint and added, as defendants, the purchasers of the property. Byrd neither sought nor obtained the permission of the bankruptcy court before filing the second amended complaint in state court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b497-5\">66. On June 1, 2007, the Trustee filed an emergency motion due to Byrd\u2019s violation of the bankruptcy court\u2019s injunction.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b497-6\">67. Byrd served Shulman Rogers with the second amended complaint on July 5, 2007. Byrd served Schlossberg, the initial Trustee, with the second amended complaint on July 18, 2007.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b497-7\">68. On September 27, 2007, the bankruptcy court entered an order finding Byrd in contempt for willfully violating the court\u2019s order of May 18, 2007.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b497-8\">69. By Order dated July 31, 2008, the district court (Alexander Williams, Jr.) affirmed the bankruptcy court\u2019s contempt order of September 27, 2007. In affirming the bankruptcy court, Judge Williams held that Byrd\u2019s filing of the second amended complaint \u201cwas particularly egregious because the [bankruptcy] court previously told [Byrd] that this type of action would violate the stay.\u201d Judge Williams concluded: \u201cBecause serving the Second Complaint did constitute willfulness and bad faith, this Court finds that the bankruptcy court appropriately imposed sanctions.... \u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b497-9\">70.

This court finds that Byrd does not appreciate the gravity of his conduct.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b498-6\">Judge Rubin then stated his conclusions of law concerning the bankruptcy matter:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b498-7\">73. The Court of Appeals summarized an attorney\u2019s duty to obey court orders in <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Garland, </em>345 Md. 383, 398-99 [692 A.2d 465] (1997). Speaking through Judge Raker, and quoting extensively from <em>Maness v. Meyers, </em>419 U.S. 449, 458-59 [95 S.Ct. 584, 42 L.Ed.2d 574] (1975), the Court of Appeals made it quite clear that a court order must be obeyed until it is vacated, modified or overturned on appeal. <em>Garland, </em>345 Md. at 398-99 [692 A.2d 465]. What lawyers simply cannot do is make \u201cprivate determinations\u201d of law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b498-8\">74. Justice Jackson commented on an attorney\u2019s duty to obey court orders in <em>Sacher v. United States, </em>343 U.S. 1, 9 [72 S.Ct. 451, 96 L.Ed. 717] (1952), as follows: \u201cOf course, it is the right of counsel for every litigant to press his claim, even if it appears farfetched and untenable, to obtain the court\u2019s considered ruling.... But if the ruling is adverse, it is not counsel\u2019s right to resist or to insult the judge \u2014 his right is only respectfully to preserve his point for appeal.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b498-9\">75. Judge Greene, speaking as a circuit court judge in an attorney disciplinary matter, cogently remarked that \u201cwhere an attorney refuses to obey a lawful order of a court, it shows obvious contempt for the very same court of which the Respondent is an officer.\u201d <em>Garland, </em>345 Md. at 398 [692 A.2d 465],</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b498-10\">76. During the course of the bankruptcy case, Byrd made innumerable private determinations of law. Byrd\u2019s willful misconduct in flagrantly disobeying court orders and the rules of the bankruptcy court, manifestly involved dishones<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>ty and was prejudicial to the administration of justice. The conduct violated Rule 8.4(c) &amp; (d).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-4\">77. Byrd violated Rule 3.4(c) when he contravened the bankruptcy court\u2019s order of September 15, 2004, after already having been found in contempt for violating the order of December 18, 2002 requiring him to allow access to the property. Byrd also violated the bankruptcy court\u2019s order of December 11, 2006, to vacate the premises by January 31, 2006. Byrd did not, and cannot, claim that these orders were not valid. Byrd\u2019s knowing and intentional violation of court orders is a violation of Rule 3.4(c). <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Mininsohn, </em>380 Md. 586, 566 [846 A.2d 353] (2004). Byrd\u2019s conduct in this regard also violated Rule 8.4(d).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-5\">78. Byrd\u2019s filing of false business reports violated Rules 8.4(b), (c), and (d). <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Siskind, </em>401 Md. 41, 67-70 [930 A.2d 328] (2007). As Judge Harrell aptly noted in <em>Siskind, </em>\u201cwords spoken by an attorney who knows they were untrue involves an inherent intent to deceive.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 70 [930 A.2d 328]. Hence, Byrd\u2019s false statements to the bankruptcy court and to the Trustee regarding his financial status violated Rules 8.4(a), (c) and (d). <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Harris, </em>403 Md. 142, 164-65 [939 A.2d 782] (2008); <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Pak, </em>400 Md. 567, 606-08 [929 A.2d 546] (2007); <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v.

With respect to Rule 8.4(b), the court concludes that Byrd committed criminal acts that reflect adversely on his fitness as a lawyer when he knowingly filed false business reports with the bankruptcy Trustee. The criminal acts are making false statements in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001 and perjury in violation of [1]8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1621. <em>See Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v.

Garland, </em>345 Md. 383, 394-95 [692 A.2d 465] (1997).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-4\">80. Byrd violated Rule 3. 1, Rule 3.4(c) and Rule 8.4(d) when he filed his second amended complaint in state court because Byrd had no colorable cause of action against the Trustee, counsel to the Trustee, Bar Counsel or the purchasers of the property. Byrd also violated these Rules when he flatly disobeyed the bankruptcy court\u2019s injunction.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-5\">81. As Byrd testified at the hearing before this court, he \u201cjust wanted to tell his story.\u201d This is the only reason he provided for intentionally violating the injunction. This reason is legally insufficient.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b500-6\">Mitigation</p>\n<p id=\"b500-7\">Judge Rubin made the following findings concerning [mitigation. He found that Respondent proved by a preponderance of credible evidence that he has no prior disciplinary record, and he and his counsel cooperated with Bar Counsel and the hearing court. Judge Rubin further found that Respondent did not have \u201cany disabling mental or physical condition that caused or contributed to his misconduct.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b500-8\">Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b500-9\">We recently set forth the standard by which we consider attorney grievance matters:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-10\">This Court has original and complete jurisdiction over attorney discipline proceedings in Maryland.

We have reviewed the hearing transcript, and we agree with Respondent that he did not testify that he \u201cassumed\u201d a continuance would be granted in that case. He did, however, testify:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-5\">I filed a motion for a continuance along with proof of the notice from another case that showed that I had to be in another courtroom at the same time, someplace else at the same time. And I just thought that automatically under the circumstances I would obtain the continuance and I didn\u2019t show up on the date and I thought that the continuance would have been automatic under those circumstances when I showed that there was a conflict.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b502-6\">Jude Rubin fairly inferred from Respondent\u2019s testimony that Respondent assumed he would get a continuance upon proof that he had a conflict. We therefore overrule the exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-7\">In his next exception, Respondent states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-8\">Respondent also excepts to the Finding in paragraph 8 of the Circuit Court\u2019s Memorandum Opinion that [Judge Rubin\u2019s] explanation that he believed the hearing in the <em>Hooker </em>case had been cancelled was not credible. The Finding is not supported by clear and convincing evidence. Neither the testimony from the Respondent [] nor the testimony from the witness for the Complainant [ ] supports this finding in any way.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b502-9\">Judge Rubin found that Respondent had filed a motion to reconsider the denial of a motion quashing a subpoena, then failed to appear at the scheduled hearing on the motion. Respondent\u2019s explanation for not appearing at the hearing was that, because one other motion filed by opposing counsel had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>been withdrawn, he \u201cthought that both matters had been taken off the calendar and [he] didn\u2019t show up.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b503-4\">It is well-settled that the hearing judge may \u201celect to pick and choose which evidence to rely upon,\u201d when assessing the credibility of the witnesses. <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v.

The hearing judge\u2019s factual findings, moreover, are entitled to significant deference. <em>See Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Kimmel, </em>405 Md. 647, 667, 955 A.2d 269, 281 (2008). Judge Rubin, as he had the prerogative to do, did not believe Respondent\u2019s explanation for not appearing at the scheduled hearing. We defer to that credibility determination, and overrule the exception, accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">In his next exception, Respondent states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-6\">Respondent also excepts to the Finding in paragraph 9 of the Circuit Court\u2019s Memorandum Opinion that \u201ccontrary to his representation to the District Court\u201d Respondent did not inform his client of the court date. The Finding is not supported by clear and convincing evidence. Nowhere in the transcript of the District Court proceedings in the <em>Honsberyer </em>case does Respondent claim he informed his client of the trial date. To the contrary Respondent told the District Court he had attempted to reach his client but had been apparently calling the wrong telephone number.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AmV\">A transcript of the July 6 proceeding before the district court was made an exhibit at the hearing. We have reviewed the transcript, just as Judge Rubin must have done. The transcript discloses that Respondent wanted a continuance because his client was not present due to the fact that he had not \u201cbeen able to reach [his] client in a couple of weeks\u201d and the last time he had spoken to his client, she told him that she was \u201cgoing out of town for the 4th [likely, a reference to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>Fourth of July holiday].\u201d The district court, evidently under the impression that Ms. Honsberger\u2019s failure to appear was her fault, declined to grant Respondent a continuance. The trial went forward and the plaintiff in that case prevailed.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-4\">Respondent filed a motion for new trial, attaching to the motion the affidavit of his client. That affidavit also was before Judge Rubin. In it, Ms. Honsberger swore that she had not received notice of the trial date from either the court or Respondent. She further swore that Respondent did not have the correct telephone number for her.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">Respondent and an attorney for the Peroutka firm who was present at the July 6 district court proceeding testified at the hearing before Judge Rubin. Each attorney addressed the various explanations Respondent gave \u2014 both to Judge Rubin and, previously, to the district court judge \u2014 for not contacting his client. We have reviewed the testimony and the exhibits, and we note, as did Judge Rubin, that Respondent\u2019s explanations lack consistency. It is true, as Respondent argues, that \u201c[n]owhere in the transcript of the District Court proceedings in the <em>Honsberger </em>case does [he] claim he informed his client of the trial date.\u201d Yet, Judge Rubin was entitled to weigh the evidence and find, first, that Respondent in fact had not told his client about the July 6 trial date, and, second, that he had no good reason for failing to do so. In the latter respect, Judge Rubin was free to discredit Respondent\u2019s explanations for not informing his client of the trial date. Consequently, we overrule Respondent\u2019s third exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-6\">Respondent\u2019s next exception addresses the court\u2019s findings concerning the <em>Respass </em>case. That exception reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-7\">Respondent also excepts to the Finding in paragraph 10 of the Circuit Court\u2019s Memorandum Opinion that \u201cByrd did not serve counsel for the plaintiff with a copy of his continuance motion.\u201d The Finding is not supported by clear and convincing evidence. The motion included a certificate of service. Otherwise it would not have been accepted by the court clerk for filing. Assuming <em>arguendo </em>counsel for the plaintiff, in fact, did not receive the copy of the continuance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>motion, that fact would not constitute clear and convincing evidence that Respondent did not serve said counsel with the motion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b505-4\">Respondent argues in further support of the exception that the Peroutka firm never complained during litigation of the <em>Respass </em>case about the lack of service.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">We shall consider this exception together with Respondent\u2019s exception directed at Judge Rubin\u2019s finding, in paragraph 11 of the memorandum opinion, that Respondent had not mailed a notice withdrawing his client\u2019s appeal in the <em>Haroey </em>case, on April 10, 2006, contrary to what \u201che represented in his certificate of service.\u201d Respondent argues, for much the same reasons as he does in connection with the previous exception, that the finding is not supported by clear and convincing evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-6\">Judge Rubin heard from Michele Gagnon, of the Peroutka firm, on the subject. She testified that Respondent was directed to send all mailings in the <em>Respass </em>case to her, but her office never received a copy of Respondent\u2019s motion for a continuance. Further, the office manager for the Peroutka firm swore in an affidavit that the office did not receive the motion for continuance anytime between June 12 and June 16. With regard to the notice withdrawing the appeal in the <em>Haroey </em>case, Judge Rubin had before him a copy of Respondent\u2019s Notice of Withdrawal of Appeal, with a certificate of service to the law firm dated April 10, 2006, as well as the envelope in which a copy of that document was mailed to the firm. The envelope was postmarked April 13, 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-7\">This evidence sufficed to permit Judge Rubin reasonably to infer that Respondent did not serve the Peroutka firm with a copy of his motion for continuance in the <em>Respass </em>case, and he delayed service of his withdrawal of the appeal in the <em>Harvey </em>case. We therefore overrule Respondent\u2019s exceptions relating to the findings in paragraphs 10 and 11 of the memorandum opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>Respondent\u2019s next exception relates to Judge Rubin\u2019s findings in paragraphs 12 and 13 of the memorandum opinion. He argues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-4\">Respondent also excepts to the Findings in paragraphs 12 and 13 of the Circuit Court\u2019s Memorandum Opinion that \u201cByrd provided interrogatory answers but they were not under oath, as required by Maryland Rule 3 \u2014 421(d). However, both sets of Answers to Interrogatories stated they were \u2018affirmed.\u2019 \u201d The Circuit [C]ourt also made a Finding in paragraph 13 of the Memorandum Opinion that Respondent\u2019s statement that the Peroutka firm was \u201cplaying games\u201d with discovery lacked credibility. In making this Finding, however, the Circuit Court contradicted its own statement in paragraph 19 of the Memorandum Opinion that \u201cthe Peroutka firm may have been playing \u2018hardball\u2019 with Byrd\u2019s clients.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">Maryland Rule 3 \u2014 421(d) states that responses to interrogatories \u201cshall answer each interrogatory separately and fully in writing under oath[.]\u201d There is ample support in the record for the court\u2019s finding that the answers to interrogatories supplied by Respondent in the <em>Sy </em>and <em>Faulkner </em>cases were not under oath; indeed, Respondent does not deny the fact. Nor do we discern any inherent contradiction between Judge Rubin\u2019s finding in paragraph 13 that he did not believe Respondent\u2019s assertion that the Peroutka firm was \u201cplaying games,\u201d and the judge\u2019s finding in paragraph 19 that the Peroutka firm may have been playing \u201chardball\u201d with Respondent. We therefore overrule Respondent\u2019s sixth exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-6\">Respondent\u2019s has two exceptions to Judge Rubin\u2019s conclusions of law set forth in paragraphs 15 through 19 of the memorandum opinion. First, he challenges Judge Rubin\u2019s conclusion that his, Respondent\u2019s, \u201cfailure to timely mail documents affected the handling of the cases by opposing counsel\u201d violated Rule 1.4(a)(2). Respondent does not make a legal argument, and simply points out the lack of testimony that the Peroutka firm ever brought any of its complaints to Respondent\u2019s attention prior to seeking court involvement. This <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>exception is much like the exceptions we have already addressed and, for the reasons we have stated, we overrule it.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-5\">Respondent takes exception to the following statement by Judge Rubin in paragraph 19 of the memorandum opinion: \u201c[WJhen the court reviews the facts of the case as a whole, the court is convinced that Byrd\u2019s conduct evidences a regular, intentional disregard of the Maryland Rules in his handling of debt collection cases, a disregard that is not countenanced simply because the Peroutka firm may have been playing \u2018hardball\u2019 with Byrd\u2019s clients.\u201d Respondent argues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ARUq\">Respondent has practiced law since 1980, focusing on debt collection cases since 2004 and has handled hundreds of debt collection cases brought by many different plaintiffs. The first and only charges ever brought against Respondent were filed by the Peroutka firm. Considering that out of the hundreds of debt collection cases brought by many different plaintiffs only the Peroutka firm (which may have been playing \u201chardball\u201d with Respondent\u2019s clients) brought charges against the Respondent, the Circuit Court\u2019s conclusion that \u201cByrd\u2019s conduct evidences a regular, intentional disregard of the Maryland Rules in his handling of debt collection cases\u201d is unsupportable, especially when the Circuit Court\u2019s conclusion in this regard is based on discreet incidents in only seven cases and where no good faith effort had been made to resolve the matters without court involvement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b507-6\">We disagree with Respondent. To begin, we read Judge Rubin\u2019s statement concerning the regularity with which Respondent disregarded the Maryland Rules of Procedure as limited to the cases that were the subject of the Janis complaint. Moreover, Judge Rubin\u2019s statement is a fair characterization of all the facts concerning Respondent\u2019s behavior in those cases. We therefore overrule Respondent\u2019s exception to that statement.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b508-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>Judge Rubin determined that Respondent had violated the following MRPC provisions: With respect to the <em>Mebane </em>and <em>Hooker </em>cases, Respondent violated Rules 1.1 and 1.3 by failing to appear for a scheduled court proceeding. With respect to the <em>Honsberger </em>case, Respondent violated Rule 1.4(a)(2) by failing, without good reason, to notify his client of the trial date. With respect to the Respass and <em>Harvey </em>cases, Judge Rubin found that Respondent violated Rule 3.3(a)(1) by failing to mail documents on the dates represented in the certificates of service. With respect to the <em>Sy </em>and <em>Faulkner </em>cases, Judge Rubin found that Respondent violated Rule 1.1 by failing to serve interrogatory answers under oath. Finally, with respect to the <em>Kaplan </em>case, to which Respondent filed no exceptions, Judge Rubin found that' Respondent violated Rule 1.1 by filing an untimely appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-4\">Respondent does not claim that the facts upon which Judge Rubin relied for each of those determinations, if supported by clear and convincing evidence, fail to support the stated rule violations. We are left, then, with determining whether Judge Rubin\u2019s findings of fact relating to the Janis complaint (including the facts we accept because we overruled Respondent\u2019s exceptions and those we accept because Respondent filed no exceptions) establish by clear and convincing evidence that Respondent violated MRPC 1.1, 1.3, 1.4(a)(2), and 3.3(a)(1), as Judge Rubin concluded. In our independent assessment of the facts, we hold that they do support those rule violations.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">\n<em>The Bankruptcy Complaint</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b508-6\">Respondent first takes exception to a footnote in Judge Rubin\u2019s memorandum opinion, in which the judge notes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-7\">At the hearing before this court, Byrd criticized the Fourth Circuit\u2019s decision for allegedly failing to address one of his grounds for appeal. This court rejects that contention for the reasons set forth by [United States District Court] Judge William Nickerson, in his Memorandum Opinion, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>entered June 15, 2004, denying Byrd\u2019s motion for reconsideration of the remand order.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b509-4\">Respondent also takes exception to Judge Rubin\u2019s finding in paragraph 28 of the memorandum opinion that: \u201cThe bankruptcy court had good reason to appoint a Trustee, even though the case had been converted to a reorganization under Chapter 11.\u201d Respondent then argues, at some length, that the bankruptcy court improperly appointed a trustee. Neither of these exceptions is relevant to the present disciplinary charges. We therefore do not address either exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-5\">Respondent excepts to Judge Rubin\u2019s finding in paragraph 31 of the memorandum opinion that: \u201cThe court finds [Trustee] Johnson\u2019s testimony regarding his efforts to work with Byrd to achieve an orderly administration of the estate to be credible.\u201d Mr. Johnson was appointed Chapter 7 Trustee following the withdrawal of Robert Schlossberg, as the original trustee. Respondent challenges Judge Rubin\u2019s finding that Mr. Johnson provided credible testimony concerning his efforts to \u201cwork with\u201d Respondent. Respondent directs us to certain testimony of Mr. Johnson and of James Hoffman, who served as counsel for Mr. Schlossberg in his capacity as trustee. In Respondent\u2019s view, \u201cHoffman and Johnson\u2019s testimony shows that they worked strenuously against the Respondent\u2019s Chapter 13 plan and against Respondent\u2019s efforts to keep his home.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">The short answer to this exception is that Judge Rubin was entitled to weigh the testimony and make credibility determinations, based on it. <em>See Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Mba-Jonas, </em>402 Md. 334, 344, 936 A.2d 839, 844 (2007). We can and do defer to such credibility assessments. We note, moreover, Mr. Johnson\u2019s testimony detailing his efforts to administer the bankruptcy estate. That testimony, credited by Judge Rubin, fully supports the finding that Mr. Johnson \u201cworked with Byrd to achieve an orderly administration of the estate.\u201d We therefore overrule the exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-7\">Respondent also excepts to the Circuit Court\u2019s Finding that Respondent\u2019s business reports were false. He characterizes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>the reports as, at worst, \u201cperhaps, somewhat imprecise and amateuristic.\u201d He points to certain evidence suggesting that \u201cthe general pattern of the business reports seemed to be under-reporting of income.\u201d Respondent then points out that this evidence \u201cconflicts with the argument advanced by Hoffman [] that Respondent was attempting to over-report his income in an attempt to mislead the bankruptcy court into believing Respondent had $117,000.00 in his bank account a[t] the January 25, 2006 confirmation hearing for Respondent\u2019s Chapter 13 plan.\u201d Respondent argues that there was \u201cno showing of a motive for falsifying his business reports,\u201d and, consequently, Judge Rubin\u2019s finding that \u201cRespondent\u2019s business reports were \u2018false and that Byrd knew they were false\u2019 is not supported by clear and convincing evidence.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b510-4\">Judge Rubin did not err in finding that Respondent \u201cdid not file accurate or complete reports,\u201d as required by the Bankruptcy Code. The judge\u2019s finding was supported by the testimony of Mr. Hoffman. He testified at some length about Respondent\u2019s duty as a Chapter 11 debtor to file monthly operating reports indicating the \u201cstatus of assets coming in, accounts receivable, collections, insurance,\u201d and his duty as a Chapter 13 debtor to file monthly operating reports indicating \u201ccash flow and expenses of the business\u201d in order to determine whether a repayment plan would be feasible. Mr. Hoffman further testified that Respondent failed to provide any information about any income generated while he was in Chapter 11, forcing Mr. Johnson to file monthly operating reports from July 2004 to January 2005 indicating an \u201cunknown beginning balance, unknown income, unknown expenses, [and] unknown <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>daily balance.\u201d Mr. Hoffman also testified that Respondent\u2019s monthly operating reports were \u201cgrossly inaccurate, [ ] deceptive and misleading.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b511-4\">Judge Rubin, as he was entitled to do, found \u201cHoffman\u2019s testimony [regarding the falsity of Byrd\u2019s reports] to be highly credible, accurate, and reliable.\u201d Based on that testimony, there was sufficient evidence to support Judge Rubin\u2019s finding that Respondent\u2019s \u201creports to the bankruptcy court were false, and that [he] knew they were false when he filed the reports.\u201d Judge Rubin was correct, moreover, in finding that, by willfully filing the false reports, Respondent violated 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001 (which makes it a crime to falsify or conceal a material fact, or to make a false statement or provide a false document to the government or a government agent), and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1621 (which prohibits perjury).</p>\n<p id=\"b511-5\">Finally, Respondent does not dispute the two findings by the bankruptcy court that he was in contempt of court for failing to comply with the court\u2019s orders to turn over his financial records to the Trustee. Respondent simply directs us to his testimony that he was attempting at the time to \u201cmaintain a semblance of a law practice,\u201d while dealing with \u201cthe myriad extant bankruptcy issues\u201d and \u201cendeavoring in good faith to provide the documents requested by the Trustee.\u201d He argues that \u201cthere was not clear and convincing evidence that his failure to timely provide the discovery was done with the intention to thwart the Trustee.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b511-6\">The short answer to Respondent\u2019s argument is that we will not examine the propriety of the bankruptcy court\u2019s finding Respondent in contempt of court for violating the court\u2019s orders pertaining to discovery. Judge Rubin properly accepted those findings of contempt. So do we.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-7\">Respondent does not directly contest Judge Rubin\u2019s findings that the bankruptcy court found him in contempt for (1) failing to comply with the court\u2019s orders that he allow the Trustee access to his property and vacate his residence so that it might be sold by the Trustee; and (2) violating the court\u2019s injunction enjoining him \u201cfrom taking any other action, including but not limited to filing a lis pendens against the Property,\u201d and from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>\u201cfiling, pursuing, or maintaining any action in state or other federal court seeking any remedy against the Trustee.\u201d Respondent simply argues, instead, that he had the right under the law to attempt to block the sale by filing in state court a complaint seeking a constructive trust against those persons involved in the sale, and by later amending that complaint after the court issued its order enjoining him from doing so. The United States District Court upheld the bankruptcy court\u2019s finding that Respondent was in contempt of its order enjoining him from such filings. Further, that court found that Respondent\u2019s filing the amended complaint \u201cdid constitute willfulness and bad faith.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">Respondent correctly acknowledges that we will not \u201cgo behind\u201d the bankruptcy court\u2019s finding nf contempt or the United States District Court\u2019s decision upholding that finding. Nor, correctly, did Judge Rubin. We therefore accept Judge Rubin\u2019s findings concerning those rulings.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-6\">Judge Rubin concluded, based on the multiple contempt findings, that Respondent violated several rules of professional conduct. The judge concluded that Respondent\u2019s \u201cwillful misconduct in flagrantly disobeying court orders and the rules of the bankruptcy court, manifestly involved dishonesty and was prejudicial to the administration of justice. The conduct violated Rule 8.4(c) &amp; (d).\u201d Judge Rubin conchided that Respondent violated MRPC 3.4(c), when he knowingly and intentionally contravened the bankruptcy court\u2019s orders to allow access to the property and to vacate the premises. Judge Rubin also concluded that Respondent violated MRPC 8.4(b), (c), and (d) by filing a false business reports in contravention of the law, and, in doing so, made false statements to the bankruptcy court and the Trustee.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-7\">Other than raising the concerns we addressed and rejected above, Respondent does not argue that the court\u2019s conclusions concerning the bankruptcy complaint are wrong as a matter of fact or law. We have reviewed each of Judge Rubin\u2019s conclusions of law, in light of the facts he found. We hold, based on that review, that the judge\u2019s conclusions of law are supported by clear and convincing evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>The Sanction</p>\n<p id=\"b513-4\">Having determined that Respondent committed multiple violations of the MRPC as found by Judge Rubin, we now consider the appropriate sanction for those violations. Petitioner requests that Respondent be disbarred. Petitioner notes that, among Respondent\u2019s many rule violations, the \u201cmost significant\u201d are his violations of MRPC 8.4(b) and 8.4(c), by committing perjury when he filed false business reports under oath in the bankruptcy proceeding. Petitioner reminds us that this act alone warrants disbarment. Petitioner also points out that Respondent\u2019s conduct obstructed the orderly administration of the bankruptcy, leading on several occasions to findings of contempt of the bankruptcy court\u2019s orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\">We are mindful that our goal in attorney grievance matters is to protect the public and the public\u2019s confidence in the legal profession. <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Kreamer, </em>404 Md. 282, 348, 946 A.2d 500, 539 (2008). In furtherance of that goal, we seek to deter other attorneys from similarly violating the MRPC. <em>Id. </em>\u201c \u2018The public is best protected when sanctions are imposed commensurate with the nature and the gravity of the misconduct and the intent with which it was committed.\u2019 \u201d <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Queen, </em>407 Md. 556, 567, 967 A.2d 198, 204 (2009) (quoting <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Taylor, </em>405 Md. 697, 720, 955 A.2d 755, 768 (2008)).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b513-6\">With respect to rule violations involving dishonesty, we have said that, unlike matters relating to competency, diligence and the like, intentional dishonest conduct is closely entwined with the most important matters of basic character to such a degree as to make intentional dishonest conduct by a lawyer almost beyond excuse. Honesty and dishonesty are, or are not, present in an attorney\u2019s character.... Disbaiment should be the sanction for intentionally dishonest conduct.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b513-7\"><em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Parsons, </em>404 Md. 175, 186, 946 A.2d 437, 444 (2008) (quoting <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Vanderlinde, </em>364 Md. 376, 418, 773 A.2d 463, 488 (2001)); <em>see </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number><em>also Siskind, </em>401 Md. at 75, 930 A.2d at 348 (stating that \u201c \u2018tactics involving dishonesty, fraud, or deceit, carry the risk of the ultimate sanction by this Court\u2019 \u201d) (quoting <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. White, </em>354 Md. 346, 366, 731 A.2d 447, 458 (1999)). We have also made clear that, \u201conly in the case of compelling extenuating circumstances \u2018will we even consider imposing less than the most severe sanction of disbarment\u2019 in cases involving dishonesty and fraudulent conduct.\u201d <em>Attorney Grievance Commission v. McClain, </em>406 Md. 1, 19, 956 A.2d 135, 145-46 (2008) (quoting <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Goodman, </em>381 Md. 480, 499, 850 A.2d 1157, 1168 (2004)).</p>\n<p id=\"b514-4\">There are. no such compelling extenuating circumstances to which Respondent points that mitigate his violations of MRPC 8.4(b) and (c). He simply argues, instead, that his conduct in the bankruptcy proceedings was a \u201cmatter of survival,\u201d the creditor who filed the involuntary bankruptcy proceedings was \u201cmean spirited,\u201d and the various Trustees (excepting the Chapter 13 Trustee) were \u201cmotivated by a desire to prevent Respondent from having any successful bankruptcy plan to pay his creditors.\u201d The record before us does not support Respondent\u2019s arguments, but even if it did, Respondent\u2019s assertions do not begin to approach the sort of compelling circumstances that might militate against disbarment for his conduct associated with the MRPC 8.4(b) and (c) violations.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">Moreover, those violations do not stand alone. In connection with the filing of false reports in the bankruptcy proceeding, Respondent also violated MRPC 8.4(d). It cannot be gainsaid that filing those reports was \u201cconduct prejudicial to the administration of justice.\u201d Respondent also violated MRPC 3.4(c) by flagrantly disobeying the bankruptcy court\u2019s orders to provide the Trustee and his attorney with access to the residence, comply with discovery, and desist from filing court papers designed to frustrate the sale. By engaging in such conduct, Respondent \u201cknowingly disobey[ed] an obligation under the rules of a tribunal.... \u201d Furthermore, Respondent repeatedly violated MRPC 1.1, 1.3, 1.4(a)(2), and 3.3(a)(1), in connection with his handling of the cases discussed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>in the Janis complaint. Those violations, like Respondent\u2019s violations of MRPC 8.4(d) and 3.4(c), add further support for the sanction of disbarment.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-4\">Finally, the mitigating factors of Respondent\u2019s lack of a record of attorney discipline and cooperation with Bar Counsel and the hearing court do not offset the significance of his numerous rule violations, of which the MRPC 8.4(b) and (c) violations loom large as particularly egregious. We conclude that \u201c \u2018[o]nly the most severe sanction of disbarment will provide the protection to the public that this [attorney grievance] procedure is supposed to provide.\u2019 \u201d <em>Kremner, </em>404 Md. at 352, 946 A.2d at 541 (quoting <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Wallace, </em>368 Md. 277, 293, 793 A.2d 535, 545 (2002)). We therefore order Respondent disbarred.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">IT IS SO ORDERED.
