In this advancement case, pursuant to the governing documents of Republic Property Trust (\u201cRepublic\u201d), we must determine whether the expenses incurred by Richard L. Kramer, Republic\u2019s former Chairman and trustee, following an internal investigation, and in response to a recommendation that he either resign or face \u201cfurther action,\u201d were incurred in connection with a \u201cproceeding\u201d under \u00a7 2-418. If so, then we must determine whether Kramer was made a \u201cparty\u201d to the \u201cproceeding\u201d by reason of his status as a trustee of Republic.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-9\">Kramer, the appellant, contends that he incurred his expenses in a \u201cproceeding\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 2-418. Specifically, he asserts, \u201c[I]t is well-established that adversarial actions taken by companies against their officers or directors constitute \u2018proceedings\u2019 that trigger the right to mandatory advancement.\u201d (Appellant\u2019s brief at 16-17.) Kramer further contends that he was made a \u201cparty\u201d to the \u201cproceed<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>ing\u201d by reason of his status as a trustee of Republic, because \u201che was the express target of the efforts to investigate his conduct and oust him from his positions as Chairman and Trustee of Republic.\u201d (Appellant\u2019s brief at 25.) Liberty Property Trust (\u201cLiberty\u201d), the appellee and Republic\u2019s successor-in-interest, disagrees with Kramer, contending that there was no \u201cproceeding\u201d to which Kramer was made a \u201cparty\u2019 by reason of his status as a trustee.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-5\">We hold that a \u201cproceeding\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 2-418 is an actual or threatened adjudicative or administrative process, or any stage of either process, including an investigation. The term \u201cproceeding\u201d does not, however, comprise a corporation\u2019s internal governance functions, such as the removal of a director or officer for cause. Although the internal investigation in this case was a \u201cproceeding\u201d under \u00a7 <em>2-\u00cd18, </em>it was not one to which Kramer was made a \u201cparty\u201d by reason of his status as a trustee of Republic. The investigation focused upon Kramer, not because of his status as a trustee of Republic, but because of his involvement with another entity, Republic Properties Corporation (\u201cRPC\u201d). Furthermore, Republic\u2019s actions following the internal investigation, during which it considered the recommendation that Kramer either resign or face \u201cfurther action,\u201d did not constitute a \u201cproceeding\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 2-418. Therefore, Kramer is not entitled an advancement, and we shall affirm the judgment of the Circuit Court for Baltimore City.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-6\">/.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-7\">\n<em>A.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b36-8\">\n<em>Republic\u2019s Governing Documents</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b36-9\">Republic was a Maryland real estate investment trust (\u201cREIT\u201d) engaged in the acquisition, development, ownership, management, control, and disposition of real property. During the pendency of the instant litigation, Republic merged with Liberty and ceased to exist. Liberty assumed Republic\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>liabilities, including the liabilities to which Republic committed itself through its governing documents.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-5\">Republic\u2019s governing documents, its Declaration of Trust and Bylaws, contained, among other things, a commitment to indemnify its trustees for certain expenses incurred in their service as trustees. Included was the imperative that Republic advance to its trustees such expenses as incurred. Article IX, \u00a7 9.3 (\u201cIndemnification\u201d) of the Declaration of Trust provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b37-6\">To the maximum extent permitted by Maryland law in effect from time to time, and in accordance with applicable provisions of the Bylaws, the Trust shall indemnify ... any present or former Trustee or officer who has been successful in the defense of a proceeding to which he or she was made a party by reason of service in such capacity, against reasonable expenses incurred by the Trustee or officer in connection with the proceeding and shall pay or reimburse, <em>in advance of [the] final disposition of the proceeding, </em>such reasonable expenses.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b37-7\">(Emphasis added.) Likewise, Article XI (\u201cIndemnification and Advance of Expenses\u201d) of the Bylaws provided, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b37-8\">To the maximum extent permitted by Maryland law in effect from time to time, the Trust shall indemnify ... any Trustee or officer ... who has been successful, on the merits or otheiwise, in the defense of a proceeding to which he or she was made a party by reason of service in such capacity, against reasonable expenses incurred by him or her in connection with the proceeding.... In addition, <em>the Trust shall pay or reimburse, as incurred, in advance of [the] final disposition of a, proceeding, reasonable expenses incurred, by a Trustee or officer or former Trustee or officer made a party to a proceeding by reason of such status, </em>provided that the Trust shall have received: (i) a written affirmation by the Trustee or officer of his or her good faith belief that he or she has met the applicable standard of conduct necessary for indemnification by the Trust as au<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>thorized by these Bylaws and (ii) a written undertaking by or on his or her behalf to repay the amount paid or reimbursed by the Trust if it shall ultimately be determined that the applicable standard of conduct was not met....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b38-4\">* <em>* </em>* *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b38-5\">Any indemnification or payment or reimbursement of the expenses permitted by these Bylaws shall be furnished in accordance with the procedures provided for indemnification or payment or reimbursement of expenses, as the case may be, under Section 2-418 of the MGCL for directors of Maryland Corporations.[<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b38-6\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b38-7\">In addition to providing indemnification and advancement rights, Republic\u2019s Declaration of Trust set forth certain procedures with respect to matters of corporate governance. Under Article VIII, \u00a7 8.2 (\u201cVoting Rights\u201d), the shareholders of Republic were to elect its trustees. Pursuant to Article V, \u00a7 5.3 (\u201cResignation, Removal or Death\u201d), a trustee of Republic could only be removed for cause, by a two-thirds vote of the shareholders.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>\n<em>B.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b39-4\">\n<em>Kramer\u2019s Request for an Advancement</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b39-5\">Richard L. Kramer was the Chairman of the Board of Trustees and a trustee of Republic. Steven A. Grigg served as Republic\u2019s President and Chief Development Officer. In addition to their positions with Republic, Kramer and Grigg co-owned RPC, an affiliate of Republic engaged in real estate development in the City of West Palm Beach, Florida.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-6\">The events pertinent to this case began in October of 2004, when the West Palm Beach Community Redevelopment Agency (\u201cCRA\u201d) voted to approve a Professional Services Agreement (\u201cPSA\u201d) between the City and RPC for a project known as \u201cCity Center.\u201d Subsequently, in November of that year, RPC entered into a consulting agreement with West Palm Beach City Commissioner Raymond Liberti, who also served on the CRA. Although Kramer was active in engaging the assistance of Commissioner Liberti, it was Grigg who, on behalf of RPC, executed the consulting agreement and two of the three extensions thereto.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-7\">After Commissioner Liberti entered into the consulting arrangement with RPC, the CRA voted to amend the PSA on three occasions. The first amendment inured to the benefit of RPC. The second and third amendments inured to the benefit of Republic because, on December 19, 2005, the CRA voted to approve an assignment of the PSA from RPC to Republic.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b39-8\">In May of 2006, federal prosecutors charged Commissioner Liberti with fraud and corruption in abuse of his elected position. Although these charges had nothing to do with Republic or RPC, the local press revealed that RPC paid <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>consulting fees to Liberti while he was voting on matters affecting RPC. The press also reported that federal and State prosecutors knew about RPC\u2019s consulting arrangement with Commissioner Liberti and that State prosecutors planned to conduct a grand jury investigation into Liberti\u2019s dealings with RPC.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-5\">In response to the potential criminal investigation into RPC\u2019s dealings with Commissioner Liberti, Republic\u2019s Audit Committee engaged the law firm of Shulman, Rogers, Gandal, Pordy &amp; Eeker, P.A. (\u201cAudit Committee Counsel\u201d) to investigate the extent of Republic\u2019s involvement. According to Audit Committee Counsel, its \u201cfocus\u201d of the investigation consisted of the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b40-6\">(i) assessing the nature of the dealings between Commissioner Liberti and Mr. Grigg in connection with the City Center project and other projects in Florida, (ii) the legality of the consulting agreements entered [into] between Commissioner Liberti and Mr. Grigg, (iii) who associated with [Republic] knew about the consulting agreements and when, (iv) whether [Republic] had a duty to disclose the consulting agreements to the City of West Palm Beach or to others, and (v) whether [Republic] contravened any laws in connection with the consulting agreements.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b40-7\">Audit Committee Counsel also examined \u201cwhether (i) Mr. Grigg\u2019s conduct in Florida ... provide[d] a basis for [Republic] to terminate Mr. Grigg for cause, and (ii) any other facts and circumstances learned in the course of the investigation suggesting] violations of law, contract, and corporate governance or ethical standards.\u201d As such, Republic recommended that Grigg take a leave of absence during the investigation and be prohibited from accessing company e-mail and materials.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-8\">Beginning in July of 2006, Audit Committee Counsel reviewed more than 40,000 documents and interviewed several persons, including Kramer, Grigg, Commissioner Liberti, and Robert Sanders, an attorney who allegedly suggested to Grigg that RPC hire Commissioner Liberti as a paid consultant. Kramer did not retain private counsel during the internal investigation. He cooperated initially, providing reasonable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>access to RPC documents. In his interview with Audit Committee Counsel, however, Kramer sought to cut short questioning. In addition, in the course of attorney Robert Sanders\u2019s interview with Audit Committee Counsel, Kramer placed extensive limitations on Sanders\u2019s ability to answer questions. The most significant of the subjects that Audit Committee Counsel could not explore were the consulting agreements between Commissioner Liberti and RPC. Eventually, Kramer began to question and challenge the authority of Republic\u2019s Audit Committee to conduct the investigation, appearing at a meeting of the Audit Committee and insisting that \u201cthis folly must stop now.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b41-5\">On October 31, 2006, Audit Committee Counsel issued a report detailing the findings of its internal investigation and providing certain recommendations. Of particular importance, Audit Committee Counsel found that Commissioner Liberti \u201ccast at least eight votes affecting RPC and/or Republic.\u201d In addition, Audit Committee Counsel recommended that Grigg\u2019s employment with Republic be terminated for cause. Pertaining to Kramer, Audit Committee Counsel observed that Kramer questioned vigorously, in several e-mails, Grigg\u2019s competence and \u201cwhether [Grigg] should play any role in [Republic].\u201d While \u201coffeifing] no prediction as to whether federal or state prosecutors w[ould] bring charges in connection with Commissioner Liberia's dealings with RPC, Mr. Grigg, and Richard Kramer,\u201d Audit Committee Counsel also opined that Kramer\u2019s actions could possibly serve as the basis for a criminal obstruction of justice charge against him.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Thus, Audit Committee Counsel concluded that Kramer\u2019s con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>duct during the investigation did not reflect an appropriate \u201ctone at the top.\u201d As such, Audit Committee Counsel recommended that Republic seek the voluntary resignation of Kramer as Chairman and member of the Board of Trustees; if Kramer would not resign, then Audit Committee Counsel recommended that the Board \u201cevaluate, weighing all material considerations, whether to take further action.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b42-4\">In response to the recommendations of Audit Committee Counsel, Kramer retained the law firm of Williams &amp; Connolly, L.L.P. to \u201cdefend\u201d him. Also in response, on November 30, 2006, Republic\u2019s Board held a special meeting to, among other things, remove Kramer from office. The Board adjourned the meeting without taking such action, however.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-5\">Following the November 30 board meeting, Republic\u2019s outside counsel agreed that Kramer would be able to appear before the Audit Committee on January 8, 2007, to respond to the recommendations of Audit Committee Counsel. Kramer requested that his attorneys be provided with the documents that Audit Committee Counsel relied upon in concluding that he should be removed from office. Republic\u2019s outside counsel agreed initially to produce the documents but recanted soon thereafter. Also around this time, on December 11, 2006, on the basis of Republic\u2019s governing documents, Kramer requested that Republic advance to Kramer the \u201clegal expenses incurred by [him] in connection with the proceeding [Republic] ha[d] begun against [him] as \u00e1 Trustee of [Republic].\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> With this request, Kramer submitted his attorneys\u2019 time records,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>an affirmation stating that he had met the applicable standard of conduct necessary for indemnification, and an undertaking promising to repay the amount advanced if it was later determined that the standard of conduct was not met. Republic denied Kramer\u2019s request, which is the subject of the instant lawsuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-4\">On January 1, 2007, Republic\u2019s General Counsel wrote to Kramer that \u201ca reckoning is coming upon Grigg, and you can get yourself caught up in it, we can join forces in support of it or you can get out of the way.\u201d Kramer never appeared at the January 8, 2007, meeting of Republic\u2019s Audit Committee, and on January 18, Republic\u2019s outside counsel agreed finally to provide Kramer with the documents that Kramer requested. Only a small fraction of the documents were provided, however, and Republic\u2019s outside counsel informed Kramer that no other documents would be produced later. Furthermore, Republic\u2019s outside counsel delivered to Kramer\u2019s attorneys the following ultimatum:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b43-5\">The Audit Committee does not intend to allow further delay. If you would like to schedule a meeting before the end of the month for your client to address the conclusions of [Audit Committee Counsel\u2019s] report that concern him (i.e., his failure to cooperate with the investigation), please let me know. If your client does not choose to avail himself of this opportunity, then the Audit Committee will proceed accordingly.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b43-6\">Kramer never appeared before the Audit Committee, and on May 3, 2007, in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City, Kramer filed a complaint against Republic to collect the expenses for which advancement was denied. On October 4, by way of the Republic/Liberty merger, Republic ceased to exist, and Kramer no longer held a position to defend. On November 2, the Circuit Court heard argument on the parties\u2019 cross-motions for summary judgment. Deciding that there <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>was no \u201cproceeding\u201d that triggered Kramer\u2019s right to an advancement under Republic\u2019s Bylaws, the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b44-5\">The Court has before it a motion for summary judgment as filed by Plaintiff, basically saying that it was a threatened or actual proceeding and there was right of Plaintiff Kramer, to have \u2014 to seek counsel, have counsel, in those matters.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b44-6\">The defendant, Republic Property Trust, has, in fact, argued in a cross-motion, motion to dismiss, in the alternative, a motion for summary judgment, stating that all of these matters are internal and there was no actual proceeding or no definable proceeding or no proceeding within the meaning of 2-418.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b44-7\">That under the circumstances, the Court recognizes the argument. It appears that the real issues here was [sic] around whether or not Plaintiff would remain as a member of the Board, as well as, in his position as chairman. It appears very clear, from the arguments made and the affidavits and other information submitted, that the defenses by Kramer was [sic] over whether or not he would be able to defend his position and remain as chairman and member of the Board.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b44-8\">It is the Court\u2019s finding, that after argument and review of the facts and circumstance[s], the cases cited \u2014 and we do appreciate your argument as to Gentile[<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>] and your interpretations on both sides.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b44-9\">This Court does find ... that there was not a proceeding within the actual meaning of the statute and that these were internal matters.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b44-10\">Defendants motion for summary judgment is hereby granted. Plaintiffs motion for summary judgment is hereby denied.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b45-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>Kramer appealed the order of the Circuit Court to the Court of Special Appeals. We issued a writ of certiorari prior to any proceedings in the intermediate appellate court. For our review are two questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b45-5\">(1) Did the trial court err in concluding that an action to remove a trustee from the board of a Maryland \u201cREIT\u201d for an alleged breach of fiduciary duty was not a \u201cproceeding\u201d within the meaning of Section 2^18 of the Maryland Code?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b45-6\">(2) Did the trial court err in denying appellant\u2019s motion for summary judgment where he \u201cwas made a party to a proceeding by reason of such status\u201d as a trustee and officer?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b45-7\">\n<em>II.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b45-8\">Section 2-418 of the Corporations and Associations Article authorizes a corporation to indemnify or advance expenses to a director who is a \u201cparty\u201d to a \u201cproceeding.\u201d Authorizing advancement is subsection (f), which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b45-9\">(f). <em>Payment of expenses in advance of final disposition of action. </em>\u2014 (1) Reasonable expenses incurred by a director who is a party to a proceeding may be paid or reimbursed by the corporation in advance of the final disposition of the proceeding upon receipt by the corporation of:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b45-10\">(1) A written affirmation by the director of the director\u2019s good faith belief that the standard of conduct necessary for indemnification by the corporation as authorized in this section has been met; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b45-11\">(ii) A written undertaking by or on behalf of the director to repay the amount if it shall ultimately be determined that the standard of conduct has not been met.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b45-12\">(2) The undertaking required by paragraph (l)(ii) of this subsection shall be an unlimited general obligation of the director but need not be secured and may be accepted without reference to financial ability to make the repayment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b46-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>(8) Payments under this subsection shall be made as provided by the charter, bylaws, or contract or as specified in subsection (e) of this section[<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b46-5\">Md.Code (1975, 2007 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 2-418(f). Regarding the difference between advancement and indemnification:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ao\">Indemnification is the right to be reimbursed for all out of pocket expenses and losses caused by an underlying claim. The right is typically subject to a requirement that the indemnitee have acted in good faith and in a manner that he reasonably believed was in the best interests of the company. As a result, an indemnification dispute generally cannot be resolved until after the merits of the underlying controversy are decided because the good faith standard requires a factual inquiry into the events that gave rise to the lawsuit. Advancement, by contrast, is a right whereby a <em>potential </em>indemnitee has the ability to force the company to pay his litigation expenses as they are incurred regardless of whether he will ultimately be entitled to indemnification. Advancement is typically not conditioned on a finding that the party seeking advancement has met any standard of conduct. A grant of advancement rights is essentially a decision to advance credit to the company\u2019s officers and directors because the officer or director must repay all sums advanced to him if it is later determined that he is not entitled to be indemnified.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b46-6\"><em>Majkowski v. American Imaging Mgmt. Servs., </em>913 A.2d 572, 586-87 (Del.Ch.2006) (footnotes omitted) (emphasis in original). Nevertheless, the authorization to indemnify or advance expenses under \u00a7 2-418 depends, generally, upon whether the expenses to be reimbursed or advanced were (or will be) incurred in a \u201cproceeding\u201d to which the indemnitee or potential indemnitee was made a \u201cparty.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b46-7\">Section 2-418 provides that the term \u201c fpjarty\u2019 includes a person who was, is, or is threatened to be made a named defendant or respondent in a proceeding.\u201d Md.Code (1975, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>2007 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 2-418(a)(6). \u201c \u2018Proceeding\u2019 means any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative, or investigative.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2-418(a)(7).</p>\n<p id=\"b47-5\">The requirement that one be a \u201cparty\u201d to a \u201cproceeding\u201d under \u00a7 2-418 to obtain an advancement was incorporated into the governing documents ol\u2018 Republic. Republic\u2019s Bylaws provided, in pertinent part:</p>\n<p id=\"b47-6\">\n<em>Article XI</em>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b47-7\">\n<em>Indemnification and Advancement of Expenses</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b47-8\">To the maximum extent permitted by Maryland law in effect from time to time, the Trust shall indemnify ... any Trustee or officer ... who has been successful, on the merits or otherwise, in the defense of a proceeding to which he or she was made a party by reason of service in such capacity, against reasonable expenses incurred by him or her in connection with the proceeding.... In addition, <em>the Trust shall pay or reimburse, as incurred, in advance of [theI final disposition of a proceeding, reasonable expenses incurred by a Trustee or officer or former Trustee or officer made a party to a, proceeding by reason of such status, </em>provided that the Trust shall have received: (i) a written affirmation by the Trustee or officer of his or her good faith belief that he or she has met the applicable standard of conduct necessary for indemnification by the Trust as authorized by these Bylaws and (ii) a written undertaking by or on his or her behalf to repay the amount paid or reimbursed by the.

Thus, as Kramer agrees, his entitlement to an advancement under Republic\u2019s Bylaws depends upon two things: first, that he incurred his expenses in connection with a \u201cproceeding\u201d under \u00a7 2-418; and second, that he was made a \u201cparty\u201d to the \u201cproceeding\u201d by reason of his status as a trustee of Republic.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-5\">In analyzing Kramer\u2019s entitlement to an advancement, we begin by noting that the parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment. The Circuit Court granted summary judgment in favor of Liberty and denied Kramer\u2019s motion. In considering a trial court\u2019s grant of a motion for summary judgment, this Court reviews the record in the light most favorable to the non-moving party. <em>Doe v. Board of Elections, </em>406 Md. 697, 711, 962 A.2d 342, 350 (2008); <em>Anderson v. The Gables, </em>404 Md. 560, 570, 948 A.2d 11, 18 (2008); <em>see Rhoads v. Sommer, </em>401 Md. 131, 148, 931 A.2d 508, 518 (2007) (\u201cWe review the record in the light most favorable to the non-moving party and construe any reasonable inferences that may be drawn from the facts against the moving party.\u201d). If there is no genuine dispute of material fact, this Court must determine whether the trial court correctly entered summary judgment as a matter of law. <em>See </em>Maryland Rule 2 \u2014 501(f)<footnotemark>8</footnotemark>; <em>Doe, </em>406 Md. at 711, 962 A.2d at 350. Here, there is no dispute of material fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-6\">Next, we recognize that this case involves an issue of statutory interpretation. In <em>Smith v. State, </em>399 Md. 565, 578-79, 924 A.2d 1175, 1182 (2007), we explained our principles of statutory interpretation as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b48-7\">Our goal, when interpreting statutes, is to \u201cidentify and effectuate the legislative intent underlying the statute(s) at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>issue.\u201d <em>Gilmer v. State, </em>389 Md. 656, 662, 887 A.2d 549, 553 (2005); <em>Cain v. State, </em>386 Md. 320, 327, 872 A.2d 681, 685 (2005); <em>Derry v.

State, </em>364 Md. 329, 345, 772 A.2d 1225, 1235 (2001). <em>See also Harris v.

State, </em>323 Md. 65, 73, 591 A.2d 481, 485 (1991) (\u201cOur focus is, therefore, centered upon the statute\u2019s policy or purpose.\u201d). The best source of legislative intent is the statute\u2019s plain language, and when the language is clear and unambiguous, our inquiry ordinarily ends there. <em>Gilmer, </em>389 Md. at 663, 887 A.2d at 553; <em>Cain, </em>386 Md. at 327, 872 A.2d at 685; <em>Pete, </em>384 Md. at 57-58, 862 A.2d at 425; <em>Drew/ v.

Thompson, </em>332 Md. 1, 6-7, 629 A.2d 731, 734 (1993). \u201cIn the interest of completeness, however, we may look at the purpose of the statute and compare the result obtained by use of its plain language with that which results when the purpose of the statute is taken into account.\u201d <em>Harris v.

In other words, the resort to legislative history is a confirmatory process; it is not undertaken to seek contradiction of the plain meaning of the statute. <em>Robey, </em>397 Md. at 454, 918 A.2d at 502; <em>Stanley, </em>390 Md. at 185, 887 A.2d at 1084. In such instances, we may find useful the context of a statute, the overall statutory scheme, and archival legislative history of relevant enactments. <em>Robey, </em>397 Md. at 454, 918 A.2d at 502.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AP\">We begin our statutory analysis by determining what constitutes a \u201cproceeding\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 2M18, as that determination is dispositive in this case. In other words, if we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>conclude that Kramer did not incur his expenses in a \u201cproceeding,\u201d then we need not consider whether Kramer was made a \u201cparty\u201d to any \u201cproceeding\u201d by reason of his status as a trustee of Republic. <em>See Shearin v. E.F. Hutton Grp., Inc., </em>652 A.2d 578, 593 (Del.Ch.1994) (noting that the first step in analyzing one\u2019s entitlement to indemnification is determining \u201cwhether the expense incurred (or to be incurred) has been incurred in connection with a covered proceeding\u201d). Neither this Court nor the Court of Special Appeals has yet clarified what constitutes a \u201cproceeding\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 2-418. We have opined, however, in the context of an administrative proceeding, that \u201c[t]he word \u2018proceedings\u2019 is a term of broad scope, encompassing both the investigative and adjudicative functions of an administrative agency.\u201d <em>Banach v. St. Comm\u2019n on Human Rel., </em>277 Md. 502, 509-10, 356 A.2d 242, 247 (1976) (citing <em>United States v.

We have also noted that \u201cany initial step before a judicial tribunal preliminary to the commencement of a civil suit or a criminal prosecution is a proceeding.\u201d <em>State v. Ensor and Compton, </em>277 Md. 529, 544, 356 A.2d 259, 267 (1976) (internal quotations and citation omitted).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b51-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>Because we are guided by \u201cordinary, popular understanding of the English language\u201d when interpreting a given statute, we shall first turn to the dictionary to aid our statutory analysis. <em>See Stoddard v. State, </em>395 Md. 653, 668-69, 911 A.2d 1245, 1254 (2006) (applying definitions contained in <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>to interpret the meaning of the word \u201cincident\u201d as it appears in the Maryland Code). As we have noted, \u00a7 2-418 defines a \u201cproceeding,\u201d in broad terms, as \u201cany threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative, or investigative.\u201d Md.Code (1975, 2007 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 2-418(a)(7). According to <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary, </em>an \u201caction\u201d is \u201c[a] civil or criminal judicial proceeding,\u201d and a \u201csuit\u201d is \u201c[a]ny proceeding by a party or parties against another in a court of law.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 31, 1475 (8th ed.2004). In addition, <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>defines a \u201cproceeding\u201d as: \u201c1. The regular and orderly progression of a lawsuit, including all acts and events between the time of commencement and the entry of judgment. 2. Any procedural means for seeking redress from a tribunal or agency. 3. An act or step that is part of a larger action....\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary, <em>supra, </em>at 1241; <em>see also </em>Webster\u2019s II New College Dictionary 902 (3d ed.2005) (providing the legal definition of \u201cproceeding\u201d as \u201c[Ijitigation\u201d or \u201c[t]he act of instituting or conducting litigation\u201d); Edwin E. Bryant, The Law of Pleading Under the Codes of Civil Procedure 3 (1894) (\u201c \u2018Proceeding\u2019 is a word much used to express the business done in courts.\u201d). Thus, based on the express language of the statute, as illuminated by these definitions, we conclude that a \u201cproceeding\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 2-418 is an actual or threatened adjudicative or administra<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>tive process, or any stage of either process, including an investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-4\">Having concluded that the term \u201cproceeding\u201d involves a process that is civil, criminal, administrative, or investigative in nature, we need not resort to external sources to determine legislative intent. Nevertheless, \u201c[i]n the interest of completeness,\u201d we shall venture beyond the express language of the statute to confirm that our interpretation is correct. <em>Smith, </em>399 Md. at 578, 924 A.2d at 1182. The portion of \u00a7 2-418 defining the term \u201cproceeding\u201d has its origin in Senate Bill 756 of the 1981 General Assembly\u2019s legislative session,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> as evolved from Md. Ann.Code art. 23, \u00a7 60 (1951). In the Department of Legislative Services\u2019s Bill File on Senate Bill 756 is an \u201cExplanation of Senate Bill 756: Indemnification\u201d that provides, \u201cThis Bill is designed to provide uniformity with the Model Act.\u201d <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Addressing the policies underlying \u00a7 2-418, the explanation further provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-5\">The Bill would provide a more workable arrangement for providing appropriate protection for directors and officers which is of key importance in view of the increased number of suits, increased cost of litigation, and desire on-the part of many companies to broaden management to include persons representing a variety of points of view.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b52-6\"><em>See also </em>James J. Hanks, Jr., Maryland Corporation Law \u00a7 6.21[a] (2008 Supp.) (\u201cMany of the provisions of Section 2-418 are based upon the indemnification provisions of the Model Business Corporation Act____Thus, the Official Comment to the Model Act is a particularly valuable aid in interpreting Section 2-418.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b52-8\">Because \u00a7 2-418 is based upon the Model Business Corporation Act (the \u201cModel Act\u201d), we shall examine the Model Act in detail. As the Model Act appeared in 1981, when the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>General Assembly enacted the version of \u00a7 2-418 relevant to this case, the Model Act defined \u201cproceeding\u201d exactly as the term appears in \u00a7 2-418: \u201cProceeding means any threatened, pending, or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative.\u201d <em>Changes in the Model Business Corporation Act Affecting Indemnification of Corporate Personnel, </em>36 Bus. Law. 99, 103 (1980). The inclusion of this language in the text <em>of the </em>Model Act, which had not before contained a definition of \u201cproceeding,\u201d was not substantive. <em>Changes in the Mod,el Business Coiporation Act Affecting Indemnification, of Corporate Personnel, snpra, </em>at 110 (noting that the definition of the term \u201cproceeding\u201d was added to eliminate inconsistencies in the statutory language). Nevertheless, the drafters of the Model Act, the Committee on Corporate Laws of the American Bar Association, recognized that \u201c[n]ew types of proceedings ha[d] emerged such as investigations of illegal payments conducted under the direction of a committee of the board of directors.\u201d <em>Changes in the Model Business Corporation Act Affecting Indemnification of Corporate Persomiel, supra, </em>at 101.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-5\">In 1994, the Committee on Corporate Laws modified the then-current definition of a \u201cproceeding\u201d to its most recent iteration: \u201cProceeding means any threatened, pending, or completed action, suit, or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, or investigative and whether formal or informal.\u201d 2 Model Bus. Corp. Act Ann., \u00a7 8.50 at 367, 371 (4th ed.2008). The Official Comment to the Model Act provides that the term \u201cproceeding\u201d should be read broadly:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-6\">The broad definition of \u201cproceeding\u201d ensures that the benefits of this subchapter will be available to directors in new and unexpected, as well as traditional, types of litigation or other adversarial matters, whether civil, criminal, administrative, or investigative. It also includes arbitration and other dispute resolution proceedings, lawsuit appeals, and petitions to review administrative actions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b53-7\"><em>Id., </em>\u00a7 8.50 at 374-75. Notwithstanding this acknowledgment that \u201cproceeding\u201d is a term of broad scope, the Committee has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>not exhibited any intent to expand the definition of the term beyond \u201clegal proceedings.\u201d <footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b54-4\">Many other states in addition to Maryland have enacted indemnification and advancement laws based upon the Model Act. <em>See </em>Joseph Warren Bishop, Jr\u201e Law of Corporate Officers and Directors: Indemnification and Insurance, \u00a7 6 at 9 (2003) (noting that all but seven jurisdictions have enacted indemnification statutes based on a version of the Model Act). One such state is Delaware, whose statute, similar to Maryland\u2019s, provides the following with respect to advancement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aj\">(e) <em>Expenses (including attorneys\u2019 fees) incurred by an officer or director in defending any civil, criminal, administrative or investigative action, suit or proceeding may be paid by the corporation in advance of the final disposition of such action, suit, or proceeding </em>upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of such director or officer to repay such amount if it shall ultimately be determined that such person is not entitled to be indemnified by the corporation as authorized in this section....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b54-5\">Del.Code Ann. tit. 8, \u00a7 145(e) (1974, 2001 Repl.Vol.) (emphasis added). Due to this similarity, and because the Delaware courts have gained a reputation for their expertise in matters of corporate law, we deem decisions of the Delaware Supreme Court and Court of Chancery<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> to be highly persuasive as to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>our interpretation of what constitutes a \u201cproceeding\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 2-418.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-4\">The Delaware courts have held that an \u201caction, suit or proceeding\u201d subject to indemnification or advancement includes an internal investigation. <em>See Homestore, Inc. v. Tafeen, </em>888 A.2d 204 (Del.2005) (holding that a corporation was required to advance to its officer the expenses incurred during an internal audit and subsequent lawsuits); <em>see also Citadel Holding Corp. v. Roven, </em>603 A.2d 818, 826 (Del.1992) (affirming that a corporation was required to advance to its former director the costs of defending the federal securities law action that the corporation brought against him); <em>Hibbert v. Hollywood Park, Inc., </em>457 A.2d 339, 341-44 (Del.1983) (concluding that a company\u2019s former directors were entitled to indemnification lor costs incurred in connection with litigation challenging their removal from the board); <em>Sun-Times Media Group, Inc. v. Black, </em>954 A.2d 380, 396 (Del.Ch.2008) (noting that \u201can action, suit or proceeding refers to a discrete administrative or judicial matter involving a particular subject and encompasses all its stages\u201d); <em>Essential Enters. Corp. v. Automatic Steel Prods., Inc., </em>164 A.2d 437, 442 (Del.Ch.1960) (concluding that directors were \u201centitled to indemnification for the costs reasonably incurred by them in successfully defending the action <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>attacking their status as directors\u201d); John F. Olson &amp; Josiah Hatch III, Director and Officer Liability, Indemnification and Insurance \u00a7 5:11 (2007) (noting that \u201ccourts construing the Delaware statute have not been tempted to read any types of limitations into \u2018action, suit, or proceeding/ \u201d and the phrase encompasses \u201cgrand jury investigations, informal SEC investigations and internal corporate investigations\u201d). Regarding the policies underlying indemnification and advancement, the Supreme Court of Delaware has observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b56-4\">Indemnification encourages corporate service by capable individuals by protecting their personal financial resources from depletion by the expenses they incur during an investigation or litigation that results by reason of that service....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b56-5\">Advancement is an especially important corollary to indemnification as an inducement for attracting capable individuals into corporate service. Advancement provides corporate officials with immediate interim relief from the personal out-of-pocket financial burden of paying the significant on-going expenses inevitably involved with investigations and legal proceedings.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b56-6\"><em>Homestore, Inc., </em>888 A.2d at 211 (footnote omitted); <em>see Hibbert, </em>457 A.2d at 344 (noting that the policy of indemnification \u201c \u2018is to encourage capable men [and women] to serve as corporate directors, secure in the knowledge that expenses incurred by them in upholding their honesty and integrity as directors will be borne by the corporation they serve\u2019 \u201d (quoting E. Folk, The Delaware General Corporation Law 98 (1972))).</p>\n<p id=\"b56-7\">Notwithstanding the broad scope of what constitutes an \u201caction, suit or proceeding\u201d subject to advancement or indemnification, and consistent with the policies underlying indemnification and advancement, the Court of Chancery has recognized that the phrase is not boundless and excludes internal matters of corporate governance. In <em>Donohue v. Corning, </em>949 A.2d 574, 575 (Del.Ch.2008), a company removed its managing partner, Mark Donohue, purportedly for cause. Alleging an improper removal, Donohue then sued the company and sought an advancement of his litigation expenses pursuant to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>the advancement provision of the company\u2019s Limited Liability Company Agreement. <em>Id. </em>The advancement provision provided, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b57-4\">To the fullest extent permitted by law, the Company shall indemnify and hold harmless ... Covered Persons from and against all liabilities and expenses ... incurred in connection with the defense or disposition of any claim, action, suit, or <em>proceeding, </em>whether civil, criminal, or investigative.... The Company shall advance such expenses to the Covered Person upon receipt of an undertaking from such Covered Person to repay the advanced amount if it is ultimately determined that such Covered Person was not entitled to indemnification.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b57-5\"><em>Donohue, 949 </em>A.2d at 576 (emphasis added).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The court held that Donohue was not entitled to an advancement because he did not incur his expenses in defending or disposing of an actual or threatened \u201cproceeding,\u201d thereby noting that a removal for cause is not a \u201cproceeding.\u201d <em>Donohue, </em>949 A.2d at 580.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-6\">Turning to the instant case, our review of Maryland legislative history, the Model Business Corporation Act, and the Delaware courts\u2019 construction of what constitutes an \u201caction, suit or proceeding\u201d subject to advancement or indemnification confirms that a \u201cproceeding\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 2-418 involves an actual or threatened adjudicative or administrative process, or any stage of either process, including an investigation. The term \u201cproceeding\u201d does not, however, comprise a corporation\u2019s internal governance functions, such as the removal of an officer or director for cause. Thus, we reject as unpersuasive Kramer\u2019s reliance on <em>Gentile v. Single-Point Financial, Inc., </em>787 A.2d 102 (Del.Ch.2001), <em>aff'd, 788 </em>A.2d 111 (Del.2001), for his contention that <em>all </em>internal adversarial proceedings are deemed to be \u201cproceedings\u201d under \u00a7 2-418.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>In <em>Gentile, </em>in connection with the firing and removal of the plaintiff director, John Gentile, the defendant company conducted an internal investigation into Gentile\u2019s conduct. <em>Gentile, </em>787 A.2d at 103-04. The company then filed a laws\u00fait against Gentile for, among other things, breach of fiduciary duty. <em>Gentile, </em>787 A.2d at 104. Pursuant to the company\u2019s bylaws, Gentile demanded an advancement of his legal expenses, including those expenses incurred during the company\u2019s internal investigation of him. <em>Gentile, </em>787 A.2d at 105. The company\u2019s bylaws provided that \u201cReasonable expenses incurred by an Indemnitee who was or is a witness or was or is threatened to be made a named defendant or respondent in a Proceeding shall be paid or be reimbursed by the Corporation at reasonable intervals in advance of the final disposition of such Proceeding....\u201d <em>Gentile, </em>787 A.2d at 106. In addition, the bylaws defined a \u201cProceeding\u201d as \u201cany threatened, pending or completed action, suite [sic] or proceeding, whether civil or criminal, administrative, arbitrative or investigative, any appeal in such an action, suit or proceeding, and any inquiry or investigation that could lead to such an action, suit or proceeding.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(alteration in original). The court held that \u201c[t]here is little question that ... the internal investigation identified in Gentile\u2019s demand meet[s] the literal definition of a \u201cProceeding.\u201d <em>Gentile, </em>787 A.2d at 106-07. Further, the court opined that \u201cto the extent Gentile has incurred any expenses relating directly to the company\u2019s internal investigation ... those costs or expenses are covered by the mandatory language of [the company\u2019s] bylaws.\u201d <em>Gentile, </em>787 A.2d at 105 n. 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-4\">Here, like in <em>Gentile, </em>there was an internal investigation. Specifically, Republic engaged Audit Committee Counsel to investigate the extent of Republic\u2019s involvement in potential criminal activity in West Palm Beach, Florida. Although this investigation was clearly a \u201cproceeding\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 2-418, the Bylaws of Republic set forth an additional requirement before a trustee or officer may obtain an advancement for expenses incurred in connection with a \u201cproceeding.\u201d That is, the trustee or officer must have been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>\u201cmade a party [to the proceeding] by reason of service in such capacity.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b59-5\">Under \u00a7 2-418, a \u201c \u2018[p]arty\u2019 includes a person who was, is, or is threatened to be made a named defendant or respondent in a proceeding.\u201d That one be made a \u201cparty\u201d to a \u201cproceeding\u201d by reason of his or her official status to be entitled to an advancement is not a requirement unique to the Bylaws of Republic. In Delaware, for example, advancement and indemnification provisions typically contain such language. <em>E.g., Homestore, Inc., </em>888 A.2d at 212.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> For a \u201cproceeding\u201d to be by reason of one\u2019s official status, there must exist a nexus or causal connection between the underlying proceeding and one\u2019s official status. <em>Homestore, Inc., </em>888 A.2d at 214. For example, \u201c[t]his connection is established if the corporate powers were used or necessary for the commission of the alleged misconduct\u201d giving rise to the \u201cproceeding.\u201d <em>Bernstein v. TractManager, Inc., </em>953 A.2d 1003, 1011 (Del.Ch. 2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b59-6\">Illustrating a \u201cproceeding\u201d to which a director was made a \u201cparty\u201d by reason of his official status is <em>Gentile. </em>In that case, Gentile received the following letter before the defendant company investigated his alleged misconduct:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-7\">Since the Company [SinglePoint] terminated your employment for cause on July 30, 1999, the Company has begun an investigation into your conduct as a former officer and director of the Company. While you were an officer and director, you owed the Company a duty of utmost good faith and loyalty. From what the Company has uncovered so far, you have breached that duty on numerous occasions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b60-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number><em>Gentile, </em>787 A.2d at 104 (alteration in original). The court held that Gentile was a \u201cnamed defendant or respondent\u201d in the internal investigation and, therefore, a \u201cparty.\u201d <em>Gentile, </em>787 A.2d at 107. Although the court did not comment directly on the matter, it is also apparent that Gentile was made a \u201cparty\u201d by reason of his official status, because the company investigated Gentile\u2019s conduct in his capacity as an officer and director of the company. <em>Gentile, </em>787 A.2d at 104.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-4\">In <em>Stifel Financial Corp. v. Cochran, </em>809 A.2d 555, 562 (Del.2002), the court held that a \u201cproceeding\u201d was not by reason of one\u2019s official corporate capacity. In that case, a company terminated its officer and director, Robert Cochran, for cause. <em>Stifel Financial Corp., </em>809 A.2d at 557. Cochran then refused to repay excess compensation and the balance of a promissory note, as was required by his employment agreement, and the company commenced an arbitration action against him to recover those amounts. <em>Id. </em>Cochran then filed an indemnification action pursuant to the company\u2019s bylaws, which provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b60-5\">\u201cThe Corporation [Stifel Financial] shall indemnify to the full extent authorized by law any person made or threatened to be made a party to any action, suit, or proceeding, whether criminal, civil, administrative or investigative, by reason of the fact that he ... is or was a director, officer or employee of the Corporation or any predecessor of the Corporation or serves or served any other enterprise as a director, officer or employee at the request of the Corporation or any predecessor of the Corporation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b60-6\"><em>Id. </em>(alteration in original). The court held that Cochran\u2019s defense of the excess compensation and promissory note claims was not susceptible to indemnification under the company\u2019s bylaws because those claims were not directed at Cochran in his official capacity as an officer and director. <em>Stifel Financial Corp., </em>809 A.2d at 562. The Court went on to note that \u201c[a]lthough Cochran\u2019s termination is the event that triggered the relevant provisions of the employment contract, Cochran\u2019s decision to breach the contract was entirely a personal one, pursued for his sole benefit.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b61-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>Here, like in <em>Stifel Financial Corp., </em>there was no nexus between the internal investigation \u2014 a \u201cproceeding\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 2-418 \u2014 and Kramer\u2019s status as a trastee of Republic. Republic\u2019s Audit Committee conducted an internal investigation primarily to investigate the dealings between RPC and Commissioner Liberti. As evident from the facts that Grigg executed consulting agreements between RPC and Liberti, and that Grigg was asked to take a leave of absence during the investigation, Audit Committee Counsel\u2019s main concern was Grigg. Thus, Grigg\u2019s name figures prominently within the acknowledged \u201cfocus\u201d of Audit Committee Counsel\u2019s investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-4\">Audit Committee Counsel\u2019s investigation concerned Kramer because of his ownership in the RPC venture, as it was RPC that entered into the consulting arrangement with Commissioner Liberti. Although Audit Committee Counsel eventually uncovered certain deprecatory e-mails from Kramer to Grigg that it found suggestive of Kramer\u2019s unfitness to be a trustee, those communications were not discovered in an investigation of Kramer as a trustee. Moreover, Kramer cannot contend that he was made a \u201cparty\u201d to the internal investigation by reason of his status as a trustee because the investigation culminated in the conclusion that Kramer failed to convey, during the course of the investigation, an appropriate \u201ctone at the top.\u201d This conclusion by Audit Committee Counsel may implicate Kramer\u2019s fiduciary duties to Republic, but Kramer\u2019s reliance upon it blurs the distinction between the investigation and its aftermath.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> It ignores the reason why Kramer became of interest to Audit Committee Counsel in the first place, thereby placing undue weight upon the fact that Kramer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>coincidentally held positions with both RPC and Republic. If anyone made Kramer a \u201cparty\u201d to the internal investigation by reason of his status as a trustee, it was Kramer himself, who obstructed Audit Committee Counsel\u2019s ability to meaningfully interview attorney Robert Sanders and challenged the authority of Republic\u2019s Audit Committee. Kramer cannot reasonably argue that such actions, taken for his personal benefit as co-owner of RPC, somehow make him subject to the advancement provision of Republic\u2019s Bylaws.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-5\">Having concluded that the internal investigation in this case, though a \u201cproceeding,\u201d was not one to which Kramer was made a \u201cparty\u201d by reason of his status as a trustee of Republic, Kramer\u2019s entitlement to an advancement necessarily hinges on our determination that some other \u201cproceeding\u201d occurred during the period in which Republic considered Audit Committee Counsel\u2019s recommendation that Kramer either resign or face \u201cfurther action.\u201d Because Kramer did not incur his expenses in an actual civil, criminal, or administrative matter, we must determine whether there was a threatened \u201cproceeding.\u201d A \u201cthreat\u201d is: \u201c1. A communicated intent to inflict harm or loss on another or on another\u2019s property.... 2. An indication of an approaching menace .... [or] 3. A person or thing that might well cause harm.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary, <em>supra, </em>at 1519. Here, the only other conceivable threats made to Kramer were that he could resign or face \u201cfurther action,\u201d that a \u201creckoning was coming upon Grigg and [Kramer] could get [himjself caught up in it,\u201d and that \u201cthe Audit Committee w[ould] proceed accordingly\u201d if Kramer did not appear before the Audit Committee. We do not deem these words sufficient to constitute a threatened \u201cproceeding.\u201d <em>Cf. Schoon v. Troy Corp., </em>948 A.2d 1157, 1170 (Del.Ch.2008) (holding that a \u201cproceeding\u201d was \u201cunquestionably threatened\u201d where a company named its director in a counterclaim). Rather, at best, the declaration indicates that Kramer would be removed from office for cause if he did not resign. A removal for cause, which would have been accomplished by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>shareholder vote with respect to Kramer\u2019s status as a trustee, and by the Board with respect to Kramer\u2019s status as Chairman, is a matter of internal corporate governance and is not a \u201cproceeding\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 2-418. <em>See Donohue, </em>949 A.2d at 576. Accordingly, because there was no \u201cproceeding\u201d to which Kramer was made a \u201cparty\u201d by reason of his status as a trustee of Republic, we shall affirm the judgment of the Circuit Court for Baltimore City.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b63-5\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE CITY AFFIRMED, WITH COSTS.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b38-8\">. <em>See </em>Md.Code (1975, 2007 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 2-418 (\"Indemnification of directors, officers, employees, and agents\").
