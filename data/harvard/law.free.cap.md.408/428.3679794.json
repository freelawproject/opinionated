The trial court allowed a police detective to testify at a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>jury trial that he received a tip from a confidential informant that a black male wearing a blue baseball cap and a black hooded sweatshirt was selling heroin at a particular intersection. Appellant Kelvin Parker was convicted by a jury of possession of heroin and sentenced to four years imprisonment. We shall hold that the testimony was inadmissible hearsay because it contained too much specific information about the defendant and his criminal activity to be justified by the proffered non-hearsay purpose of establishing why the detective was at the intersection. Because its admission into evidence was not harmless, we shall reverse the judgment below and remand the case for new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">FACTS AND LEGAL PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b461-6\">On the morning of November 2, 2006 at approximately 10:30, Detective David McGowan of the Baltimore City Police Department was working in plain clothes in an unmarked vehicle near the intersection of Carey and Laurens Streets. McGowan described the area as \u201can open air drug market\u201d and a \u201cheroin shop.\u201d He said that he was at the location because of a telephone call he had received from one of his registered confidential informants. McGowan testified, over Parker\u2019s objection, that the informant told him that a black male wearing a blue baseball cap and black hooded sweatshirt was \u201cat the corner of Carey and Laurens selling heroin from his person, meaning the drugs were on him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b461-7\">McGowan related that once he arrived in the area, he began making observations from a covert location \u201c[ajbout a half a city block\u201d from the corner of Carey and Laurens. He observed a black male wearing a blue baseball cap and a black hooded sweatshirt \u2014 later identified as Mr. Parker \u2014 walking around at the intersection of Carey and Laurens. McGowan indicated that he observed Parker for twenty to thirty minutes. He watched Parker walk into a corner liquor store and \u201cwithin a couple of seconds two unknown males followed him into the liquor store.\u201d The two unknown individuals were inside the liquor store for \u201cmaybe five to ten seconds\u201d and then walked out empty-handed and left the area.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>McGowan indicated that before these two men entered, he had seen \u201cabout four to five other individuals walk in the store\u201d and \u201cwalk right back out with no packages in hand.\u201d McGowan explained that based upon his experience, \u201cindividuals who are engaged in illegal narcotics activity will utilize these corner stores, these Chinese stores, these carryouts, whatever they might be, ... to conceal what they\u2019re doing[.]\u201d He then expressed his expert opinion that \u201cMr. Parker was engaged in illegal narcotic activity.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">According to McGowan, Parker walked out of the store and walked westbound on Laurens Street. McGowan lost sight of Parker for a brief period, but then saw Parker by the Capital Cake Company. McGowan and two other detectives who were with him, Detectives Ott and Maurice, pulled up next to Parker in their vehicle and got out. The detectives were in plain clothes, but were wearing badges on the outside of their garments. Parker did not run when McGowan approached, but according to McGowan, Parker said, \u201cOh shit.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b462-6\">McGowan recovered three gel caps of heroin out of Parker\u2019s right rear pants pocket and an additional thirteen gel caps of heroin in a small incision in the seam of his waistband. Each of the gel caps was worth $10. The detectives also recovered $82 from Parker\u2019s person, including one $20 bill, two $10 bills; six $5 bills, and twelve $1 bills. Based on the denominations of money, McGowan believed the bills were proceeds from the sale of eight gel caps. McGowan testified that the drugs were never fingerprinted \u201cbecause [he] recovered them directly from the person of Mr. Parker or his possession.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b462-7\">On cross examination, McGowan first testified that Parker went into the store for \u201cseveral brief seconds.\u201d When defense counsel showed him the statement of probable cause, however, McGowan acknowledged that he then wrote that Parker went into the store for \u201cseveral minutes.\u201d McGowan also admitted that: during his investigation he never went inside the liquor store; the two unknown men he observed were not stopped; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>there was no blue light camera<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> at that intersection; he could not recall how many other people were present on the street outside of the Capital Cake Company; and the pants with the incision were not recovered. Neither of the detectives who were with McGowan was called to testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">Parker testified that he was in front of the Capital Cake Company about 10:30 in the morning talking to a girl who worked there. About fifteen or twenty minutes later, Parker\u2019s friend Warren passed by and spoke to Parker. Parker then picked up his bike and walked with it up the street to the corner liquor store. As Parker got to the liquor store, Warren \u201cand the guy that was with him\u201d were coming out of the store, so Parker \u201cstepped in and stepped right back out.\u201d Warren and the person with him then walked across the street, got into the truck Warren was driving, and pulled away.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-6\">Parker said that about five minutes later, three white officers in an unmarked tan car who had been sitting \u201cby the bar the whole time\u201d backed up around the corner. McGowan then got out of the car, asked Parker if he had \u201canything to poke, stick, or stab him[,]\u201d and started searching Parker. According to Parker, McGowan \u201cdropped [Parker\u2019s] pants to the ground\u201d but \u201cdidn\u2019t find anything.\u201d While McGowan was searching Parker, one of the other officers was searching two men that he had against the liquor store wall. The third officer went across the street to search the grass. When the third officer returned, he told McGowan that \u201cit\u2019s not over there, I don\u2019t see it.\u201d Parker testified that the officer went over to the grassy area again, returned, and said something to McGowan. Parker was then handcuffed.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-7\">On cross examination, Parker denied that McGowan found sixteen vials of heroin on him. lie also denied saying \u201coh shit\u201d to McGowan, and that he told McGowan that he had \u201ca little bit of heroin in my back pocketf.]\u201d In rebuttal, McGow<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>an testified that after Parker said \u201coh shit[,]\u201d he asked Parker if he had any illegal narcotics on his person. According to McGowan, Parker replied, \u201cI got a little bit of heroin in my back pocket.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">The jury began its deliberations late in the second day of trial and continued their deliberations the next day. After twice reporting itself deadlocked, the jury found Parker guilty of possession of heroin. Parker filed an appeal to the Court of Special Appeals. We issued a writ of certiorari, on our own initiative, to consider the following question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b464-6\">Did the trial court err in allowing testimony by Detective McGowan that he received a tip from a registered confidential informant that a black male wearing a blue baseball cap and a black hooded sweatshirt was selling heroin from his person at the corner of Carey and Laurens Streets?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b464-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b464-8\">\n<em>The Informant\u2019s Extrajudicial Statement</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b464-9\">Parker contends that the trial court erred in allowing testimony by Detective McGowan that he received a tip from a registered confidential informant that a black male wearing a blue baseball cap and a black hooded sweatshirt \u2014 later identified as Parker \u2014 was selling heroin at the corner of Carey and Laurens streets. This testimony requires reversal, he argues, because (1) it is' inadmissible under the Maryland Rules of Evidence, (2) its admission violated his confrontation rights under the Sixth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution and Article 21 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights, and (3) its admission was not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. Parker offers two related evidentiary grounds for the statement\u2019s inadmissibility \u2014 hearsay and relevancy:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b464-10\">[T]he informant\u2019s statement to Detective McGowan was clearly inadmissible hearsay if offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted, and, if offered \u201cto show why Detective McGowan was there,\u201d ... the probative value (if any) of the informant\u2019s statement was far outweighed by the danger of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>unfair prejudice because of the strong likelihood that the jury would misuse the information and treat it as additional substantive evidence of Mr. Parker\u2019s guilt.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">The State asserts that the trial court acted within its discretion in admitting the confidential informant\u2019s statements. The State maintains that it made clear to the court in a pretrial motions healing that it intended to introduce the confidential informant\u2019s statement to explain why McGowan \u201cwas there and what, if any, actions [he] took.\u201d It argued that the statement was not being offered \u201cfor the truth of the matter.\u201d The motions court deferred its ruling on the evidence until its introduction at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-6\">At trial, Parker objected when the State asked McGowan during direct examination, \u201cDo you remember why on November 2nd you were called to that 1200 block of Laurens Street?\u201d At the ensuing discussion at the bench, Parker expressed his concern that \u201cthis jury is going to hear hearsay.\u201d The State then re-asserted its reason for offering the statement: \u201cit\u2019s just to show the [effect] on the listener. It\u2019s non-hearsay. It\u2019s to show why Detective McGowan was there. It\u2019s not a confrontation clause argument.\u201d The trial court then overruled Parker\u2019s objection \u201cbased on [the State\u2019s] representation that it\u2019s not being offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted as to the confrontation clause[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b465-7\">\u201c[T]his Court has regularly adhered to the principle that we will not reach a constitutional issue when a case can properly be disposed of on a non-constitutional ground.\u201d <em>State v. Lancaster, </em>332 Md. 385, 404 n. 13, 631 A.2d 453, 463 n. 13 (1993). Because we shall hold that the trial court committed reversible error in admitting the confidential informant\u2019s extrajudicial statement under our laws of evidence, we will not address Parker\u2019s contentions based upon the Confrontation Clauses of the Sixth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution and Article 21 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights. <em>See Graves v. State, </em>334 Md. 30, 38, 637 A.2d 1197, 1201 (1994)(declining to address the defendant\u2019s right of confrontation arguments when reversing the judgment on state evidentiary grounds).</p>\n<p id=\"b466-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>Under Maryland Rule 5-801, hearsay is defined as \u201ca statement, other than one made by the declarant while testifying at the trial or hearing, offered in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-5\">The threshold questions when a hearsay objection is raised are (1) whether the declaration at issue is a \u201cstatement,\u201d and (2) whether it is offered for the truth of the matter asserted. If the declaration is not a statement, or if it is not offered for the truth of the matter asserted, it is not hearsay and it will not be excluded under the hearsay rule.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b466-6\"><em>Stoddard v. State, </em>389 Md. 681, 688-89, 887 A.2d 564, 568 (2005). Maryland Rule 5-802 states that \u201c[ejxcept as otherwise provided by these rules or permitted by applicable constitutional provisions or statutes, hearsay is not admissible.\u201d We discussed the standard of review for hearsay rulings in <em>Bernadyn v. State, </em>390 Md. 1, 7-8, 887 A.2d 602, 606 (2005):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ala\">We review rulings on the admissibility of evidence ordinarily on an abuse of discretion standard. Review of the admissibility of evidence which is hearsay is different. Hearsay, under our rules, <em>must </em>be excluded as evidence at trial, unless it falls within an exception to the hearsay rule excluding such evidence or is \u201cpermitted by applicable constitutional provisions or statutes.\u201d Md. Rule 5-802. Thus, a circuit court has no discretion to admit hearsay in the absence of a provision providing for its admissibility. Whether evidence is hearsay is an issue of law reviewed <em>de novo.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b466-7\">(Citation omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b466-8\">In arguing that the confidential informant\u2019s statements were admissible for a non-hearsay purpose, the State invokes the evidentiary rules on relevancy. Maryland Rule 5-402 provides that \u201c[ejvidence that is not relevant is not admissible.\u201d \u201c\u2018Relevant evidence\u2019 means evidence having any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.\u201d Md. Rule 5-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>401. Under Rule 5-403, however, evidence may be excluded, though relevant, \u201cif its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">Our standard of review on a relevancy question depends on whether the \u201cruling under review was based on a discretionary weighing of relevance in relation to other factors or on a pure conclusion of law.\u201d <em>J.L. Matthews, Inc. v. Md.Nat\u2019l Capital Park &amp; Planning Comm\u2019n, </em>368 Md. 71, 92, 792 A.2d 288, 300 (2002). \u201cWhen the trial judge\u2019s ruling involves a weighing, we apply the more deferential abuse of discretion standard.\u201d <em>Id. </em>When the trial judge\u2019s ruling involves a legal question, however, we review the trial court\u2019s ruling <em>de novo. Id. </em>The trial court\u2019s conclusion that the informant\u2019s statement was not being offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted is a hearsay ruling. Thus, we review the statement\u2019s admissibility <em>de novo.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b467-6\">In <em>Graves, </em>334 Md. at 33-34, 637 A.2d at 1199-200, we considered the admissibility of an extrajudicial statement made to the arresting officer by an individual arrested for having assaulted two men. One of the victims, Derek Jones, was sitting on the steps of a store, waiting for a bus, when two men approached. One of the men pulled out a gun and said, \u201cDon\u2019t move.\u201d The victim\u2019s father, David Jones, witnessed the incident, crossed the street toward Derek, and asked Derek \u201cwhat the trouble was.\u201d When the two men looked at David, Derek pushed the gun away and ran. The two assailants then walked away. When the police arrived, Derek gave a description of one of the men and the police eventuaily arrested Kenneth Trusty, who told the arresting officer, John Reynolds, that Graves had been his accomplice. Graves was charged with assault upon Derek and David and attempted robbery of Derek with a dangerous and deadly weapon. A jury convicted Graves of both assault charges but acquitted him of attempted robbeiy.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-7\">At trial, Trusty was not called as witness to testify against Graves. Instead, the trial court permitted Officer Reynolds to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>testify on direct examination that when Trusty was arrested, Trusty told him that the other individual involved was Graves:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AJ0\">\u201cQ [Prosecutor]: Did you have an opportunity to talk to [Trusty]?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-5\">A [Reynolds]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-6\">Q And about what did you talk to him?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-7\">A About the other individual.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-8\">Q Which other individual?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-9\">A The one that was still at large.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-10\">Q Did he give you a name \u2014 ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-11\">[Defense counsel]: Objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-12\">THE COURT: Overruled.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-13\">A Yes. He said his name was Michael Graves.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-14\">Q What did you do with the name?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-15\">A I recorded it in my small \u2014 I carry a small notebook with each date of when I work and my car number and I recorded the name.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b468-16\"><em>Id. </em>at 35, 637 A.2d at 1200. The notebook was also admitted into evidence over Graves\u2019s hearsay objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-17\">Graves contended that the testimony in which Trusty was said to have named Graves was a statement made by an out-of-court declarant, offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted. The State responded that the evidence at issue was \u201cnot hearsay because it was not admitted for the truth of the matter asserted, but rather, was properly admitted for the limited purpose of showing how the police came to assemble a photographic array containing Graves\u2019 picture.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 37, 637 A.2d at 1201.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-18\">We held that Trusty\u2019s extrajudicial statements contained in the officer\u2019s testimony and notebook were inadmissible. <em>Id. </em>at 42-43, 637 A.2d at 1203-04. We observed the general rule that \u201ca relevant extrajudicial statement is admissible as non-hearsay when it is offered for the purpose of showing that a person relied on and acted upon the statement and is not introduced for the purpose of showing that the facts asserted in the statement are true.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 38, 637 A.2d at 1201. This <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>general rule is frequently applied in criminal cases when police reliance on extrajudicial statements is \u201crelevant on issues of probable cause, lawfulness of arrest and search and seizure where evidence is offered that was obtained as a result of the search for evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 38, 637 A.2d at 1202.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-4\">We cautioned, however, that the non-hearsay purpose of providing the basis upon which the arresting officer acted is not relevant to the question of a defendant\u2019s guilt or innocence and is inadmissible hearsay:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b469-5\">\u201c[I]n many cases coming before this Court where the lawfulness of an arrest and of a search incidental thereto are in issue, direct evidence to show the basis upon which the arresting officers acted either is not offered at all, or is alluded to guardedly as \u2018information received\u2019 or in some other and equally uninformative manner (doubtless designed to avoid an objection that it is hearsay), or is actually excluded as hearsay. <em>On the question of the guilt or innocence of the defendant it clearly is hearsay and hence is inadmissible; </em>but on the issues of probable cause and the lawfulness of arrest and of the admissibility of evidence obtained through any search made in connection with the arrest, such testimony, even if hearsay, is directly relevant and is admissible. Therefore, the determination of the admissibility of evidence which is dependent upon the lawfulness of an arrest, should be made by the trial judge as a preliminary matter quite apart, of course, from the question of the guilt or innocence of the accused; and if the case is being tried before a jury, such a matter should be heard out of the presence of the jury. Such a question may be raised, before trial by a motion to exclude any evidence claimed to have been improperly obtained.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b469-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 39, 637 A.2d at 1202 (quoting <em>Farrow v. State, </em>233 Md. 526, 532-33, 197 A.2d 434, 437-38 (1964))(emphasis added). Quoting Professor McCormick, we explained the danger of allowing the jury to hear an arresting or investigating officer\u2019s specific basis for his actions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>\u201cIn criminal cases, the arresting or investigating officer will often explain his going to the scene of the crime or his interview with the defendant, or a search or seizure, by stating that he did so \u2018upon information received\u2019 and this of course will not be objectionable as hearsay, <em>but if he becomes more specific by repeating definite complaints of a particular crime by the accused, this is so likely to be misused by the jury as evidence of the fact asserted that it should be excluded as hearsay.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b470-5\"><em>Graves, </em>334 Md. at 39-40, 637 A.2d at 1202 (citing <em>McCormick on Evidence </em>\u00a7 248, at 587 (Edward W. Cleary ed., 2d. ed.l972))(emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b470-6\">We pointed to the Court of Special Appeals decision in <em>Purvis v. State, </em>27 Md.App. 713, 343 A.2d 898 (1975) as an application of this principle. We summarized <em>Purvis:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-7\">[Purvis\u2019s] conviction by a jury of distribution of heroin was reversed because the trial court permitted testimony by an undercover police agent, who had purchased heroin from the defendant, that he decided to attempt to make the purchase because he had been told by a confidential informant that the defendant was selling heroin. The testimony of the agent submitted to the jury the out-of-court declaration of an unknown informant that the defendant was selling heroin. The fact that the defendant was a heroin dealer was the very object that the prosecution had undertaken to establish. Thus, the Court of Special Appeals found the statement to be \u201cof misleading probative force which tended to influence the trier of facts to believe that before Purvis\u2019 contact with the officers he was already a dealer in heroin and thus more likely to have sold the drug to the detectives as charged.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b470-8\"><em>Graves, </em>334 Md. at 40, 637 A.2d at 1202 (citing <em>Purvis, </em>27 Md.App. at 725, 343 A.2d at 904). The <em>Purvis </em>court concluded that it was error to have admitted the hearsay testimony by the police agent. <em>Purvis, </em>27 Md.App. at 725, 343 A.2d at 905. We reached the same conclusion in <em>Graves, </em>viewing this limitation on the admission of extrajudicial statements to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>justify police conduct as \u201cin accord with the well-settled rule that the trial court, in its discretion, may exclude relevant evidence if it believes that the probative value of the evidence is substantially outweighed by the dangers of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues or misleading the jury.\u201d <em>Graves, </em>334 Md. at 40, 637 A.2d at 1202-03.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">Tn concluding that the extrajudicial statement in <em>Graves </em>was inadmissible, we rejected the proffered non-hearsay purpose on relevancy grounds:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-6\">[WJhen Officer Reynolds\u2019 testimony that Trusty told him that Graves was his accomplice was offered before the jury, its only possible relevance as nonhearsay at the guilt/innocence stage was to demonstrate that the investigating officer relied on that information when he included the petitioner\u2019s photograph among those assembled for a photographic array to be viewed by the assault victims. That conduct by the police officer would have been just as effectively explained by testimony that his selection of the photographs was based \u201con information received.\u201d When that limited probative value is weighed against the unfair prejudice to the petitioner because of the likelihood that the jury would misuse that information as substantive evidence of guilt, we hold that the trial judge abused his discretion in admitting the testimony.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-7\">ik * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-8\">Therefore, if the statement was offered for the purpose of proving the truth of the matter asserted by Trusty, it was clearly inadmissible hearsay. On the other hand, if it was offered for its limited probative value to show that the officer acted upon it in arranging the photographic array, that probative value was greatly outweighed by its unfair prejudice to Graves because of the danger of misuse of the information by the jury.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b471-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 42-43, 637 A.2d at 1203-04.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-10\">Our Court of Special Appeals and courts in other jurisdictions, when confronted with an officer\u2019s trial testimony that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>relays specific information received from an informant, generally have ruled such testimony to be inadmissible hearsay. <em>See Zemo v.

Bankston, </em>63 N.J. 263, 307 A.2d 65, 67-69 (1973)(concluding that a court admitted hearsay by allowing a detective\u2019s testimony that the defendant fit the description of the person they were looking for after indicating that based on information received from an informer, officers \u201c \u2018had a description of [the individual\u2019s] clothing\u2019 \u201d and learned that \u201c \u2018[h]e was inside the tavern\u2019 \u201d and \u201c \u2018had narcotics in his possession\u2019 \u201d; the \u201cinescapable inference from [the detective\u2019s testimony] was that the informer had given information that defendant would have narcotics in his possession\u201d and \u201cthe jury was led to believe that an unidentified informer ... had told the officers that defendant was committing a crime\u201d); <em>State v. Braxter, </em>568 A.2d 311, 312, 315 (R.I.1990)(ruling inadmissible a detective\u2019s testimony that he received information from an informant about a holdup that would take place at Louttit Laundry on August 26, 1986 and reasoning that such testimony that \u201crecounts the substance of a conversation with an informant concerning a crime by the accused is not within the officer\u2019s personal knowledge and violates the hearsay <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>rule\u201d; the testimony was \u201cfar more than was necessary to explain the police presence at the laundry\u201d and \u201chad the effect of bolstering the state\u2019s case with impermissible hearsay by showing \u2018as background\u2019 that a conspiracy was in the works and that there was an intent to rob the laundry\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">In arguing for the statement\u2019s admissibility as non-hearsay in this case, the State would have us distinguish <em>Graves, Purvis, </em>and <em>Zemo </em>on the grounds that in those cases, the evidence directly implicated the defendant in the crime with which he was charged by specifically referencing the defendant\u2019s name. It argues that here, on the other hand, the confidential informant did not tell the police that Parker was selling heroin, and \u201csaid only that someone wearing a blue hat and black sweat shirt was selling heroin on the corner of Carey and Laurens Streets.\u201d Specifically distinguishing <em>Graves, </em>the State argues that \u201cbecause the confidential informant did not directly implicate Parker, there was less \u2018likelihood that the jury would misuse [the statement] as substantive evidence\u2019 of Parker\u2019s guilt.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b473-6\">We do not view this distinction from <em>Graves </em>as material. Use of a defendant\u2019s name is not the only way to identify him or her, and when the hearsay provides contemporaneous and specific information about the defendant\u2019s clothing, location, and activity, it can be highly persuasive as to the defendant\u2019s actual guilt of the crime charged, even without a name. Here, the timing and particularity of the description, without evidence that there were other individuals wearing this type of clothing, left the jury with a virtually inescapable inference that the individual observed by the informant selling heroin at the corner of Carey and Laurens was Parker, who was wearing exactly these clothes when arrested. McGowan testified that he received the informant\u2019s tip via a cell phone call and arrived \u201cfwjithin five minutes\u201d at the location from which he observed Parker. One can hardly conclude, therefore, that the jury was not likely to misuse the informant\u2019s information as substantive evidence of Parker\u2019s guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>Indeed, the State proved this point by using the informant\u2019s extrajudicial statement for the truth of the matter asserted. In closing, the State argued as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-5\">Mr. Parker got caught with sixteen vials of heroin. He\u2019s been charged with possession of heroin and you must find him guilty of possessing this heroin. The evidence in this case was very simple. You heard from Detective McGowan who sat right here at this witness stand. He looked at you straight in the eye. He had no reason not to tell you what happened, and what did he tell you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-6\">\n<em>He told you he got a tip from his registered confidential informant that an individual wearing jeans and a black hoody was selling heroin at this corner. So he responded to the corner and what did he see. He saw Mr. Parker who matched that description.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b474-7\">(Emphasis added.) The State thus used the hearsay statement to corroborate McGowan\u2019s account that Parker was engaging in \u201cillegal narcotic activity\u201d which explained Parker\u2019s heroin possession. <em>See Conley, </em>620 So.2d at 183 (concluding that \u201c[rjegardless of the purpose for which the State claims it offered the evidence, the State <em>used </em>the evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b474-8\">Citing cases from other jurisdictions, the State offers, as alternative grounds for admission, that it was justified in eliciting the informant\u2019s statement because out-of-court statements explaining an officer\u2019s actions are admissible when the propriety of an investigation is placed at issue. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Davis, </em>154 F.3d 772, 778-79 (8th. Cir.1998), <em>cert denied, </em>525 U.S. 1169, 119 S.Ct. 1090, 143 L.Ed.2d 91 (1999)(stating that \u201cevidence may not be admitted for the non-hearsay purpose of explaining an investigation where the propriety of the investigation is not a relevant issue at trial[,]\u201d but finding no error in the admission of out-of-court statements when defense counsel argued in opening that \u201cthe government did not conduct \u2018any independent investigation\u2019 to verify [an informant\u2019s] story and made \u2018automatic assumptions\u2019 about the defendant\u2019s guilt\u201d); <em>Chestnut v. Commonwealth, </em>250 S.W.3d 288, 292-94 (Ky.2008)(affirming admission of testimony <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>by an officer that one of the victims made a \u201cshow up\u201d identification of the defendant on the same day of the crime in order to rebut defendant\u2019s testimony accusing the officers of lying about their investigation, when the testimony was offered to prove the officer\u2019s motive for arresting the defendant). Applying the rationale in these cases, the State argues that admission of the informant\u2019s statement was proper because Parker, in denying (1) having any heroin on his person, (2) saying \u201coh shit\u201d to McGowan, and (3) telling McGowan that he had \u201ca little bit of heroin in my back pocketf,]\u201d implied that McGowan was \u201clying about the circumstances surrounding his investigation of Parker and Parker\u2019s ultimate arrest.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b475-4\">Parker\u2019s mere denials did not place at issue the propriety of McGowan\u2019s investigation such that the State was justified in eliciting the informant\u2019s extrajudicial statements. Parker never challenged at trial why McGowan was at the 1200 block of Laurens Street. He never argued to the jury in opening that McGowan insufficiently investigated the veracity of the informant\u2019s information and made automatic assumptions about his guilt, as in <em>Davis. </em>Nor did Parker accuse McGowan of lying and question McGowan\u2019s motive for arresting Parker, as in <em>Chestnut. </em>In his opening statement, defense counsel merely asserted Parker\u2019s innocence and exhorted the jury to apply the reasonable doubt standard and presumption of innocence:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Adk\">Mr. Parker has been charged with a crime he didn\u2019t commit. The State\u2019s Attorney and a police officer who you\u2019re going to see later[,] they\u2019re the ones accusing and prosecuting him. He didn\u2019t do this. He\u2019s not taking a deal so we\u2019re having a trial and as a result we need you. We need you to sit and listen to the evidence and apply the standard which in this case is guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-5\">* * <em>*</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-6\">[Parker] is presumed innocent. That means that each and everyone [sic] of you during this entire process take it for granted that he did not commit this crime. Only if the State can remove all of that reasonable doubt do you get to that point.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b476-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>Defense counsel then responded to the State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s several statements in open argument prefaced by the words \u201cDetective McGowan will tell you[,]\u201d and encouraged the jury to base their verdict on the facts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-5\">One of the things that I\u2019m not going to do right now is talk about the evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-6\">Shoot, the State certainly did. I think some of the most interesting words that the State\u2019s Attorney mentioned is Detective McGowan will tell you. Evaluate the evidence ladies and gentlemen. At the end of this case we will talk about the facts. It is my belief that after you\u2019ve heard those facts you\u2019re going to find Kelvin Parker not guilty.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b476-7\">The informant\u2019s statement, moreover, was introduced during the State\u2019s case-in-chief and then used for the truth of the matter asserted in the State\u2019s closing argument. These two aspects fatally undermine the State\u2019s asserted non-hearsay purpose justification. In permitting McGowan to explain why he was working at the 1200 block of Laurens Street, the court should have allowed McGowan to say only that he was there \u201cbased \u2018on information received.\u2019 \u201d <em>See Graves, </em>334 Md. at 42, 637 A.2d at 1204.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-8\">\n<em>Harmless Error</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b476-9\">The State argues that the admission of McGowan\u2019s testimony regarding the informant\u2019s statements, if error, was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. In assessing whether an error was harmless, we apply the following test 'as articulated in <em>Dorsey v. State, </em>276 Md. 638, 659, 350 A.2d 665, 678 (1976):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-10\">[W]hen an appellant, in a criminal case, establishes error, unless a reviewing court, upon its own independent review of the record, is able to declare a belief, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the error in no way influenced the verdict, such error cannot be deemed \u201charmless\u201d and a reversal is mandated. Such reviewing court must thus be satisfied that there is no reasonable possibility that the evidence complained of \u2014 -whether erroneously admitted or excluded\u2014 may have contributed to the rendition of the guilty verdict.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b477-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>The State posits that the jury \u201cwas presented with two diametrically opposed versions of events\u201d and its verdict was founded on its finding McGowan\u2019s testimony more credible than Parker\u2019s. It then asserts that the admission of the informant\u2019s statements, while helping explain why McGowan was in the area conducting surveillance, did not influence this credibility determination. According to the State, \u201cif the jury found Detective McGowan credible, then his testimony amply supported a guilty verdict even without the confidential informant\u2019s statements.... If the jury found Detective McGowan not credible, however, it would not have credited his testimony about the confidential informant\u2019s statements.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b477-5\">This argument simply begs the question. Credibility is determined by many factors, including the existence of corroborating evidence. The State\u2019s argument suggests that the jury makes its credibility determination simply on the jurors\u2019 personal assessments of the witness based on his story, his appearance, his body language, and his words. And it implies that the jury is more likely to believe a police officer just because he or she is a police officer \u2014 an unacceptable bias \u2014 or because the officer is not charged with a crime. Were we to make this assumption, we would sabotage two cornerstones of our criminal justice system \u2014 neutrality and the presumption of innocence.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-6\">We cannot declare a belief, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the admission of the informant\u2019s statement into evidence in no way influenced the jury\u2019s verdict. Both McGowan and Parker testified that there were two other officers present at the time of Parker\u2019s arrest, but only McGowan was called to testify. The State introduced into evidence the sixteen vials of heroin McGowan said he found on Parker, but McGowan indicated that the vials were never fingerprinted. The jury evidently considered this case a close one, as it informed the court on two occasions before returning its verdict that it was deadlocked. In this close case, that turned on whether the jury credited McGowan\u2019s testimony over Parker\u2019s, the informant\u2019s statement that an individual fitting Parker\u2019s description was \u201cselling heroin from his person\u201d at the corner of Carey and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>Laurens provided potentially scale-tipping corroboration for McGowan\u2019s testimony that he observed Parker engage in what he believed to be \u201cillegal narcotic activity\u201d and then recovered from Parker sixteen gel caps of heroin. As in <em>Graves, </em>the testimony in question \u201cadded substantial, perhaps even critical, weight to the State\u2019s case\u201d against Parker. 384 Md. at 43, 637 A.2d at 1204.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE CITY REVERSED.
