Bar Counsel charged Respondent with violating the following Maryland Rules of Professional Conduct (\u201cMRPC\u201d): 1.1 (Competence), 1.3 (Diligence), 8.1(a) and (b) (Disciplinary Matters), and 8.4(a) and (d) (Misconduct).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">Pursuant to Maryland Rule 16-752(a),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> we referred the petition to the Honorable Judith C.

FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b322-6\">Respondent was admitted as a member of the Bar of this Court in July 1970. The Petition stemmed from a complaint concerning Respondent\u2019s representation of an estate. The complaint was filed by a party with an interest in the estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-7\">Judge Ensor made the following findings of fact concerning the charges in the Petition, beginning with general background facts that set her complaint-specific findings in context. Judge Ensor wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-8\">Introduction</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-9\">By way of background, Thelma Werner (\u201cMs. Werner\u201d) moved home to 3909 Pinewood Avenue in Baltimore City in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>order to care for her aging mother and stepfather, Daniel G. Imhoff (sometimes \u201cMr. Imhoff\u201d). After her mother passed, Ms. Werner continued to care for and reside with Mr. Imhoff until his death on November 11, 1977. Upon his death, Mr. Imhoff left to Ms. Werner a life estate in the 3909 Pinewood Avenue home. At the conclusion of the life estate, the home was to be sold, with the proceeds to be distributed pursuant to Mr. Imhoff s will.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-4\">Ms. Charlotte W. Main (sometimes \u201cMs. Main\u201d), an attorney, was appointed personal representative of Mr. Imhoff s Estate. Ms. Main died in 1994.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-5\">By letter dated March 31, 1997, Mr. Pawlak contacted Ms. Werner and informed her that he and another attorney by the name of Mr. Prem had succeeded Ms. Main as the attorneys for the Estate of Daniel G. Imhoff.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-6\">At the time that this letter was sent, there was in existence an estate checking account with NationsBank, now Bank of America.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-7\">On July 28, 1998, Mr. Pawlak wrote to Ms. Pauline Wolfe (\u201cMs. Wolfe\u201d), another member of Ms. Werner\u2019s family, and acknowledged that he had received the requested list of surviving heirs. Mr. Pawlak reiterated that he had \u201csucceeded to the law practice of Charlotte W. Main, Co-Personal Representative\u201d of Mr. Imhoff s Estate. Respondent made clear that he intended \u201cto petition the Court to be appointed as Successor Personal Representative for the purpose of completing the administration and distribution of Uncle Dan\u2019s Estate through the sale of 3909 Pinewood Avenue when Thelma Werner\u2019s life estate ends.\u201d Mr. Pawlak further promised to move forward to obtain the heirs\u2019 consents to his appointment \u201cwithin the next ninety days.\u201d The letter also referenced the checking account with Bank of America.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-8\">On August 17, 1998, Mr. Pawlak obtained a Consent to Appointment of Personal Representative and Waiver of Bond from Irvin I. Imhoff (Mr. Imhoffs Brother), through his Power of Attorney, Ms. Wolfe.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>Mr. Pawlak met with Ms. Wolfe, Ms. Longenecker (another relative), and their respective husbands at the 3909 Pinewood Avenue residence on August 17, 1998. He followed that meeting with a letter dated August 21, 1998. In that correspondence, Mr. Pawlak confirmed that the estate checking account had a balance of $3,000. He also reiterated the importance of having a successor personal representative appointed \u201cto protect the Imhoff heirs\u2019 financial interests in the Estate and to provide the legal expertise necessary for the ultimate distribution to the heirs____\u201d Again, Mr. Pawlak promised to forward consents to the Imhoff heirs within the September/October time frame.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-5\">Mr. Pawlak did not prepare and/or file with the Court the pleadings necessary to have himself appointed successor trustee.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b324-6\">Judge Ensor then turned to her findings concerning the charges in the Petition. She wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-7\">Findings of Fact</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-8\">The parties, for the most part, are in agreement as to the material facts and circumstances surrounding the charges lodged against Mr. Pawlak. In August, 2006, twelve years after Ms. Main had passed and nine years after Mr. Pawlak had indicated his intention to petition the Court to appoint a successor trustee, Ms. Werner was 96 years old and suffering from dementia. Ms. Werner had previously given her power of attorney to Roy Sanders, the husband of her niece, Delores Sanders (sometimes \u201cMs. Sanders\u201d). The Sanders ultimately determined that Ms. Werner could no longer safely reside in the Pinewood Avenue home. Mr. and Mrs. Sanders decided that it would be in Ms. Werner\u2019s best interest to relinquish the life estate and move to an assisted living facility. To this end, Ms. Sanders attempted to contact Mr. Pawlak in order to advise him of the change in circumstances and inquire as to the status of the estate issues.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b325-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>According to Ms. Sanders, she obtained Mr. Pawlak\u2019s telephone number from her aunt and placed calls to him on a number of occasions, all without success. Ms. Sanders testified that she reached a law office and left messages on the firm answering machine. She further testified that these calls were not returned. According to her testimony, having failed to reach Mr. Pawlak by phone, Ms. Sanders wrote to him at least twice. Ms. Sanders\u2019 first letter to Mr. Pawlak, dated August 20, 2006, was admitted into evidence[ ]. In this correspondence, Ms. Sanders, among other things, requested information as to whether Respondent still had possession of the records pertaining to the matter and inquired as to \u201chow it is to be handled.\u201d Ms. Sanders closed her letter by asking Mr. Pawlak to respond to her inquiries \u201cas soon as possible.\u201d Ms. Sanders pointed out in the letter that \u201c[wjhenever Thelma vacates the house someone must take charge of it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b325-4\">Mr. Pawlak denies ever having received the August 20, 2006 letter. During his testimony, he emphasized that, while the address was correct, Ms. Sanders failed to include the appropriate suite number. Ms. Sanders, however, testified that the letter was never returned to her.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b325-5\">Roy Sanders testified that, during the Spring of 2006, he sent Mr. Pawlak an up-to-date list of current heirs to the Imhol'f Estate, together with their contact information. According to Mr. Sanders, he and his wife met with Mr. Pawlak at the Pinewood Avenue address in June, 2006. Mr. Sanders testified that, during this meeting, Mr. Pawlak again promised that he would handle the matters on behalf of the estate and \u201cget this through the courts.\u201d At that same time, Mr. Pawlak discussed with the Sanders the need to sell the house as well as the need to obtain an appraisal of the personal property in the home belonging to the estate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b325-6\">In February 2007, Mr. and Ms. Sanders moved Ms. Werner to an assisted living facility in York, Pennsylvania. After the move, for some period of time, the Sanders continued to maintain the Pinewood Avenue home. They <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>also left in the home several personal items belonging to the estate. In May or June of that same year, however, the Sanders relinquished the keys to 3909 Pinewood Avenue to Mr. Pawlak. Since that time, Mr. Pawlak has maintained the property, using his personal funds to do so.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b326-4\">Based on these findings, Judge Ensor drew the following conclusions of law.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AXD\">Rule 1.1 Competence.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b326-5\">After considering all of the facts and circumstances presented by way of live testimony and documentary evidence, this Court finds by clear and convincing evidence that the Respondent violated Rule 1.1 of the Maryland Rules of Professional [Cjonduct. Obviously, the significant delay, in and of itself, is deeply concerning. That said, perhaps even more disturbing is Mr. Pawlak\u2019s own testimony that, after Ms. Main\u2019s death and his letter of March, 1997, he saw no reason to petition the Court for a successor trustee. At a minimum, Mr. Pawlak knew there existed an estate checking account with a balance of approximately $3,000. He knew this money was to be used to finance capital repairs on the Pinewood Avenue home. He knew that the account listed Ms. Main as the personal representative and that, absent action on his part, the funds could not be accessed. He knew that, absent activity on the account, the funds would be deemed abandoned and would eschew [sic] to the State. Certainly, Mr. Pawlak\u2019s inaction demonstrates a lack of thoroughness and preparedness. His failure to appreciate the ramifications of this inaction constitutes lack of the legal knowledge required to handle this representation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b326-6\">Rule 1.3 Diligence.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b326-7\">This court finds, again by clear and convincing evidence, that Mr. Pawlak violated Rule 1.3 of the Maryland Rules of Professional Conduct. In March, 1997, Mr. Pawlak under<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>took to represent the Imhoff Estate. Literally, more than one decade later, the appropriate paperwork has not been filed with the Court. The home is currently vacant and uninsured. Moreover, the beneficiaries have yet to receive their distributions. In addition, Mr. Pawlak failed to respond to Ms. Sanders\u2019 inquiries. There is no question that Mr. Pawlak has been less than diligent.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">Rule 8.1(a), (b) Bar Admission and Disciplinary Matters.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-6\">Mr. Pawlak is charged with knowingly failing to respond to a lawful demand for information from a disciplinary authority. He readily concedes that he received correspondence from Bar Counsel on October 28, 2006, December 7, 2006, January 10, 2007, and again on January 24, 2007. Mr. Pawlak admits that, in each of these letters, Bar Counsel sought a response to Ms. Sanders\u2019 Complaint. Mr. Pawlak failed to respond to any of these letters. Indeed, he took no action whatsoever until a Bar Counsel Investigator contacted him in March 2007.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-7\">At the September 4th hearing, Mr. Pawlak indicated that he failed to respond to the various correspondence from Bar Counsel because he could not locate the Imhoff file.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> It is noteworthy, however, that Mr. Pawlak never contacted Bar Counsel to inform her that the file was missing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-9\">It is noteworthy, however, that Mr. Pawlak never contacted Bar Counsel to inform her that the file was missing. Based in large part on Mr. Pawlak\u2019s own testimony, this Court finds that the Respondent was embarrassed by the course of his representation and further ashamed to discover that he was the subject of a Complaint. He was aware of the Complaint, knew that Bar Counsel was repeatedly seeking information from him, and failed to respond. Therefore, this Court finds by clear and convincing evidence that Mr. Pawlak violated Rule 8.1 of the Maryland Rules of Professional Responsibility.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b328-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>Rule 8.4(a), (d) Misconduct.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-4\">Mr. Pawlak\u2019s lack of diligence and competence in handling the instant matter clearly amounts to a violation of the Maryland Lawyers\u2019 Rules of Professional Conduct. As stated previously, Mr. Pawlak undertook to represent the Imhoff Estate more than a decade ago. To date, a successor trustee has not yet been appointed. Obviously, this significant delay amounts to misconduct, but Mr. Pawlak further violated the Rules of Professional Conduct by not responding promptly to correspondence from Bar Counsel, despite admitting that he was aware that a Complaint had been filed against him and that Bar Counsel had repeatedly sought information from him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-5\">Additionally, Mr. Pawlak\u2019s conduct has been prejudicial to the administration of justice given that the property located at 3909 Pinewood Avenue currently remains vacant and uninsured, and the beneficiaries of the Imhoff Estate have yet to receive their distributions. Furthermore, Mr. Pawlak allowed the Bank of America account, with approximately $3,000 to eschew [sic] to the State. This conduct has served to undermine the public\u2019s trust in the legal system. Therefore, this Court finds by clear and convincing evidence that Mr. Pawlak\u2019s conduct with regard to the handling of the Imhoff Estate rises to the level of misconduct pursuant to Rule 8.4.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-6\">Judge Ensor summarized her conclusions of law, as follows.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-7\">Conclusions of Law</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-8\">This Court finds by clear and convincing evidence that Respondent violated Maryland Rule of Professional Conduct 1.1 by failing to petition the Court for a successor trustee despite the serious ramifications of not doing so, including allowing $3,000 in the estate checking account with Bank of America to eschew [sic] to the State.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-9\">This Court also finds by clear and convincing evidence that Respondent violated Rule 1.3 by failing to file the appropriate paperwork to become successor trustee despite <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>undertaking to represent the Imhoff Estate more than a decade ago.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-4\">This Court further finds by clear and convincing evidence that Respondent violated Rule 8.1 by failing to respond timely to correspondence sent by Bar Counsel.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-5\">This Court also finds by clear and convincing evidence that Respondent violated Rule 8.4 by failing to petition the Court for a successor trustee despite undertaking to represent the Imhoff Estate nearly a decade ago and by failing to respond timely to the various correspondence sent by Bar Counsel. This Court further finds by clear and convincing evidence that Defendant\u2019s actions were prejudicial to the administration of justice given that the property located at 3909 Pinewood Avenue currently remains vacant and uninsured, the multiple beneficiaries of the Imhoff Estate have yet to receive their distributions, and Mr. Pawlak allowed the Bank of America account with approximately $3,000 to eschew [sic] to the State.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-6\">Judge Ensor found the following facts in mitigation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-7\">Mitigating Factors</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-8\">Mr. Pawlak was admitted to the Maryland Bar in June, 1970. This is the first time in his thirty-eight years of practice that he has been accused of any sort of misconduct. At the hearing, Mr. Pawlak appeared genuinely remorseful, indicating several times that he was ashamed and embarrassed about the manner in which he handled the case. He made clear that he was not trying to hide anything, and that he did not intend for this situation to occur. Mr. Pawlak indicated that he has been in denial about the status of this matter. He clearly now understands that his failure to prudently address the situation has, in his own words, \u201ctarnished his reputation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-9\">Mr. Pawlak has not sought attorney\u2019s fees in this manner. Additionally, Mr. Pawlak has advanced $2,000 of his own funds to maintain the 3909 Pinewood Avenue property, paying, among other things, property taxes and utility bills. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>He has also utilized his own funds to maintain the lawn at the property on a regular basis.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-4\">Furthermore, at the hearing on this matter, Mr. Pawlak made clear that he accepts full responsibility and stands ready to make things right. The Respondent stated that he would like the opportunity to take the necessary steps to retrieve the $3,000 that was once in the estate checking account with Bank of America. Mr. Pawlak promised that, if that amount is no longer recoverable, he will personally reimburse the estate. He also asked for another opportunity to file the requisite substitution paperwork with the Court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-5\">Mr. Pawlak\u2019s actions in the case at bar appear to be an aberration.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b330-6\">II. EXCEPTIONS</p>\n<p id=\"b330-7\">Neither Petitioner nor Respondent has filed exceptions to Judge Ensor\u2019s findings of fact and conclusions of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-8\">III. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b330-9\">We rec\u00e9ntly set forth the standard by which we consider attorney grievance matters:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-10\">This Court has original and complete jurisdiction over attorney discipline proceedings in Maryland. Even though conducting an independent review of the record, we accept the hearing judge\u2019s findings of fact unless they are found to be clearly erroneous. This Court gives deference to the hearing judge\u2019s assessment of the credibility of witnesses. Factual findings by the hearing judge will not be interfered with if they are founded on clear and convincing evidence.

Bar Counsel recommends an indefinite suspension because \u201cRespondent has evidenced by his actions a sufficient and persistent disregard for his clients [sic] best interest by failing to move the matter forward for over a decade.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b332-4\">\u201cOur goal in attorney discipline matters is to protect the public and the public\u2019s confidence in the legal profession rather than to punish the attorney.\u201d <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Kreamer, </em>404 Md. 282, 348, 946 A.2d 500, 539 (2008) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). We seek to deter other attorneys from violating the Rules of Professional Conduct. <em>Id. </em>\u201cThe severity of the sanction depends on several things, including \u2018the circumstances of each case, the intent [with] which the acts were committed, the gravity, nature and effects of the violations as well as any mitigating factors.\u2019 \u201d <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Nichols, </em>405 Md. 207, 217, 950 A.2d 778, 785 (2008) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">We consider the following facts and circumstances presented by the case at bar. Respondent, having repeatedly assured Ms. Werner, her family, and the heirs to the Imhoff Estate that he would represent the Estate, owed them competent and diligent representation. Respondent did not carry out either obligation. He failed for nearly a decade to follow through on his promise to several of the interested parties that he would petition for appointment as substitute personal representative. His years of inaction caused the Estate checking account (the existence of which he was fully aware) to escheat to the State. Moreover, in 2006 he failed to respond to Ms. Sanders\u2019s multiple efforts to obtain his assistance in handling the disposition of the Pinewood Avenue property.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-6\">Even after Respondent took over some responsibility for the property the following year, his efforts on behalf of the Estate were modest at best. Importantly, he made no effort even then to carry out his promise to seek appointment as substitute personal representative, sell the house, and distribute the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>residue of the Estate to the heirs. Respondent\u2019s conduct in connection with the Tmhoff Estate led, at the least, to significant delay in closing the Estate, and violated MRPC Rules 1.1, 1.3, and 8.4(a) and (d).</p>\n<p id=\"b333-4\">Moreover, Respondent intentionally and repeatedly failed to cooperate with Bar Counsel\u2019s inquires during investigation of this matter. Respondent\u2019s recalcitrance in that regard violated MRPC Rule 8.1(b), and, like his conduct in connection with the Imhoff Estate, shows a disregard for the proper administration of justice, thereby violating MRPC Rule 8.4(a) and (d).</p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">The mitigating facts that Judge Ensor found include that Respondent has been an attorney for 38 years and has not previously been charged with professional misconduct. He did not seek fees in connection with the Imhoff matter, and he advanced nearly $2,000 of his own funds to maintain the Pinewood Avenue property. The judge also noted that Respondent\u2019s conduct in this matter appears to be an aberration, and he has shown genuine remorse.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-6\">Judge Ensor considered as well that Respondent \u201cmade clear that he accepts full responsibility and stands ready to make things right.\u201d The judge noted Respondent\u2019s testimony \u201cthat he would like the opportunity to take the necessary steps to retrieve the $3,000 that was once in the estate checking account with Bank of America.\u201d Judge Ensor also noted that Respondent \u201cpromised that, if that amount is no longer recoverable, he will personally reimburse the estate.\u201d Judge Ensor noted, too, that Respondent \u201casked for another opportunity to file the requisite substitution paperwork with the Court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b333-7\">We accept Judge Ensor\u2019s observations as supported by the facts presented to her at the time. We received information from Bar Counsel at oral argument in this case, however, that now casts into serious doubt at least one of the judge\u2019s observations. Bar Counsel informed us that, as of February 2, 2009 (three days before the date of oral argument before us), Respondent still had not followed through on his promise to seek appointment as personal representative of the Imhoff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>Estate and complete the final administration of the Estate. In noting that fact, we are aware that the Imhoff heirs may not wish Respondent to pursue such appointment. However, unless or until the wishes of the Imhoff heirs are made clear in that regard, we are left only with the representation of Bar Counsel that Respondent, so far, has reneged on his express promise to the court to try to remediate his past transgressions.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-4\">We have held in the past that indefinite suspension is the proper sanction to impose when an attorney has violated \u201cvarious [ ] provisions of the MRPC coupled with a violation of MRPC 8.1.\u201d <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v.
