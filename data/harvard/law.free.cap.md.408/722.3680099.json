Whether the [Respondent Annapolis, Maryland] Port Wardens\u2019 decision [to grant the Application] for a Maritime Construction Permit filed by [Respondent] East-port Yachting Center, LLC, [ (EYC) ] is void <em>ab initio </em>due to the failure to give legally sufficient notice of the hearing [held on the Application^?]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b754-10\">2. Whether the Circuit Court [for Anne Arundel County] and Court of Special Appeals erred in failing to strike the Port Wardens[\u2019] void decision[?]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b754-11\">We granted the Petition. 406 Md'. 744, 962 A.2d 371 (2008). For the reasons that follow, we shall answer \u201cno\u201d to both questions, and therefore affirm the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-12\">I. Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b754-13\">The Circuit Court affirmed the decision of the Port Wardens in a MEMORANDUM OPINION filed on May 2, 2007. The FACTS AND PROCEDURE section of that opinion includes the following procedural history:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b754-14\">EYC is located on Back Creek at 726 Second Street in Eastport. On June 6, 2006, EYC submitted an application to the City of Annapolis for the replacement of Pier \u2018B\u2019 and 133 feet of bulkhead. The application received recommendations of approval from the Department of Neighborhood &amp; Environmental Programs on June 14, 2006; the Maryland Department of the Environment on June 15, 2006; the U.S. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number>Army Corps of Engineers on June 19, 2006; and the Department of Planning and Zoning on June 23, 2006.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b755-5\">The application was set for a public hearing before the Port Wardens on June 27, 2006. Notice of the hearing was published in The Capital on June 19, 2006, and June 20, 2006. EYC also sent notice via certified mail to the surrounding property owners, including Petitioner, on June 21, 2006.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b755-6\">At the hearing, Scott Mielke, the permit coordinator for EYC, presented EYC\u2019s application to the Port Wardens. Upon request of the Port Wardens, Mielke stipulated that the slips at the end of the proposed pier would not be used to dock any boat larger than forty-five feet to ensure that the harbor lines would not be breached. There was no testimony nor correspondence offered in opposition to EYC\u2019s application.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b755-7\">The Port Wardens found that the project does not have a material effect on the environment, navigation, or other riparian property owners. The Port Wardens also found that the project does not breach the lateral or harbor lines, does not conflict with WME [Waterfront Maritime East-port] or Critical Area zoning regulations, is consistent with the 1998 Comprehensive Plan, and is necessary to improve the services of the marina. The Port Wardens unanimously approved the application in its written Findings on August 2, 2006.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b755-8\">In the words of the Petition for Writ of Certiorari:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b755-9\">[On] June 29, 2007, Mr. Rogers filed his notice of appeal to the Court of Special Appeals. On April 1, 2008, the Court of Special Appeals heard oral argument on this matter. At the hearing, the Court of Special Appeals questioned the parties on the merits of the appeal, and raised no question as to the jurisdictional basis for the appeal. On August 29, 2008, the Court of Special Appeals issued an unreported decision dismissing Mr. Rogers\u2019 appeal .... Therein, the Court of Special Appeals held that it did not have jurisdiction to hear an appeal from a decision <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"726\">*726</page-number>of the Port Wardens, citing, <em>inter alia, </em>Md.Code, Cts. <em>&amp; </em>Jud.

Whether the findings of the Port Wardens were clearly erroneous[?]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b758-14\">* <em>X X</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b758-15\">The decision of the Port Wardens was arbitrary and capricious, unsupported by substantial evidence, failed to set forth the reasoning on which it was based, and contained clearly erroneous findings. For each and all of these reasons, the decision of the agency must be reversed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b758-16\">The Circuit Court\u2019s MEMORANDUM OPINION included the following findings and conclusions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b759-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"729\">*729</page-number>\n<em>ISSUES</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b759-4\">1. Does Petitioner have standing to contest the decision of the Port Wardens after not being present at the administrative hearing?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b759-5\">2. Was the decision of the Port Wardens arbitrary and capricious, clearly erroneous, or not supported by substantial evidence?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b759-6\">3. Were the findings of the Port Wardens made in sufficient detail?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b759-7\">\n<em>DISCUSSION</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b759-8\">This matter is before the Court for judicial review of a decision of the Port Wardens. The Port Wardens \u201cregulate the placement, erection and construction of structures an other barriers within or on the waters of the City....\u201d Annapolis City Code, \u00a7 15.16.020. The issues before this Court are whether: (i) Petitioner has standing to bring this matter before the Court; (ii) the decision was based on substantial evidence, was arbitrary or capricious, or was clearly erroneous; and (iii) the decision was made in sufficient detail. For the reasons stated below, the Court finds that Petitioner does not have standing to bring this matter before the Court. Even if Petitioner did have standing, the Court finds that the Port Wardens\u2019 decision was based on substantial evidence, was not arbitrary or capricious, was not clearly erroneous, and was made in sufficient detail.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b759-9\">Does Petitioner have standing to contest the decision of the Port Wardens after not being present at the administrative hearing?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b759-10\">Petitioner contends that he has sufficient standing to appeal based on his status as an adjoining landowner pursuant to <em>Sugarloaf v. Dept. of Env\u2019t, </em>344 Md. 271[686 A.2d 605] (1996). EYC counters by arguing that Petitioner has no standing because he is not an aggrieved party. Petitioner\u2019s property is located two parcels down from the subject <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"730\">*730</page-number>property. EYC also argues that Petitioner does not have standing because he did not participate in the administrative proceedings.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b760-5\">\u201cA person aggrieved by a decision of the port wardens may appeal that decision to the Circuit Court of Anne Arundel County....\u201d Annapolis City Code \u00a7 15.16.050(F).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b760-6\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b760-7\">Petitioner relies on <em>Sugarloaf </em>as a basis for having standing in this case. In <em>Sugarloaf </em>the plaintiffs actually participated in the hearing before the Administrative Law Judge. <em>Sugarloaf </em>344 Md. at 280-81[, 686 A.2d at 610]. Therefore, being a party to the administrative proceeding was not at issue. <em>Sugarloaf </em>went on to uphold the rule that adjoining landowners are prima facie aggrieved for purposes of standing to bring judicial review. <em>Id. </em>at 296-97[686 A.2d at 618].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b760-8\">This case differs from <em>Sugarloaf </em>because Petitioner did not do anything to preserve his standing as a party to the proceeding. EYC sent Petitioner notice of the administrative hearing by certified mail. Petitioner chose neither to attend the hearing nor to submit any written opposition to the Port Wardens. Therefore, Petitioner did not preserve his standing to appeal the decision of the Port Wardens because Petitioner did not become a party to the administrative proceeding.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b760-9\">As stated above, Petitioner noted an appeal to the Court of Special Appeals. In an unreported opinion, that Court ordered that Petitioner\u2019s appeal be \u201cdismissed for lack of jurisdiction,\u201d on the grounds that (1) \u201cthere is no express statutory provision in state, county, or local law conferring jurisdiction upon the Court of Special Appeals to hear appeals arising from decision of the Annapolis Board of Port Wardens,\u201d and (2) \u201cwhen [Petitioner] brought his action for judicial review before the circuit court, he only challenged the discretion of the Port Wardens and the substance of their findings [but] did not allege the kind of failure to perform a nondiscretionary duty that would give rise to a mandamus action.\u201d <em>Rogers v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number><em>Eastport Yachting Center, LLC, </em>No. 07-990, slip op. at 6 (Md.Ct.Spec.App. Aug. 29, 2008). The opinion of the Court of Special Appeals included the following analysis:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b761-5\">In the present case, Mr. Rogers did not seek a writ of mandamus, either fin] his petition for judicial review or in his appeal. He now alleges that he was aggrieved by the Port Wardens\u2019 failure to abide by its own procedures with respect to notice. Though this allegation of an agency\u2019s failure to abide by its own non-discretionary duties invites comparisons to <em>Gisriel [v. Ocean City Bd. of Supervisors of Elections, </em>345 Md. 477, 693 A.2d 757 (1997)] and <em>Murrell [v. Mayor &amp; City Council of Baltimore, </em>376 Md. 170, 829 A.2d 548 (2003) ], this case can be distinguished.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b761-6\">In <em>Gisriel, </em>the appellant challenged the agency\u2019s exercise of its ministerial duties every step of the way-to the board directly, before the city council, and in circuit court. In <em>Murrell, </em>the appellant responded to the notices that the City did provide, asked for an administrative appeal, and attended the hearing with the Department of Housing. Mr. Rogers, on the other hand, failed to attend the hearing before the Port Wardens; nor did he communicate his concerns to the Port Wardens in writing. In the circuit court, he had only sought a judicial review of the <em>manner </em>in which the Port Wardens performed their duty, involving the substantiality of the evidence supporting factual findings, the reasonableness of its inferences and conclusions. <em>Cf. Gisriel, </em>345 Md. at 498[, 693 A.2d at 767]. He did not argue that the Port Wardens had a nondiscretionary duty to publish notice of a hearing in two separate calendar weeks \u2014 the essence of his notice argument \u2014 until he briefed the question of standing in his appeal to this court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b761-7\">In <em>Murrell, </em>the appellant argued on appeal that his action in the circuit court had been in the manner of a mandamus action. Here, Mr. Rogers makes no such argument. When no applicable state or local law expressly confers jurisdiction on the Court of Special Appeals, and when an appellant waits until an appeal to allege that an agency failed to perform its nondiscretionary duties, then the Court of Spe<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"732\">*732</page-number>cial Appeals has neither statutory nor common law jurisdiction over the case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b762-5\"><em>Id., </em>slip op. at 22-28 (footnote omitted, emphasis in opinion).</p>\n<p id=\"b762-6\">II. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b762-7\">Jurisdiction of the Court of Special Appeals</p>\n<p id=\"b762-8\">\u201cIt is an often stated principle of Maryland law that appellate jurisdiction, except as constitutionally authorized, is determined entirely by statute, and that, therefore, a right of appeal must be legislatively granted.\u201d <em>Gisriel v. Ocean City Bd. of Supervisors of Elections, </em>345 Md. 477, 485, 693 A.2d 757, 761 (1997), <em>cert. denied, </em>522 U.S. 1053, 118 S.Ct. 702, 139 L.Ed.2d 645 (1998). Maryland Code (1974, 1998 Repl. Vol.), \u00a7 12-301 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article states that except as provided in \u00a7 12-302, \u201ca party may appeal from a final judgment entered in a civil or criminal case by a circuit court.\u201d Section 12-302(a), in pertinent part, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b762-9\">Unless a right to appeal is expressly granted by law, \u00a7 12-301 does not permit an appeal from a final judgement of a court entered or made in ... reviewing the decision of ... an administrative agency[.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b762-10\">In <em>Gisriel, </em>this Court stated:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b762-11\">[WJhen a circuit court proceeding in substance constitutes ordinary judicial review of an adjudicatory decision by an administrative agency or local legislative body, pursuant to a statute, ordinance, or charter provision, and the circuit court renders a final judgment within its jurisdiction, \u00a7 12-302(a) is applicable, and an appeal to the Court of Special Appeals is not authorized by \u00a7 12-301.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b762-12\">345 Md. at 496, 693 A.2d at 766-67 (citation omitted). <em>See also Prince George\u2019s County v. Beretta U.S.A. Corp., </em>358 Md. 166, 174, 747 A.2d 647, 651 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b762-13\">Section 10-222 of the State Government Article provides for judicial review of the final decision in a contested case decided by an administrative agency. A \u201ccontested case\u201d is one in which, <em>inter alia, </em>the proceeding is before an \u201cagency.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"733\">*733</page-number>State Government Article \u00a7 10-202(d). An \u201cagency\u201d is defined as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b763-4\">(1) an officer or unit[<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>] of the State government authorized by law to adjudicate contested cases; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b763-5\">(2) a unit that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b763-6\">(i) is created by general law;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b763-7\">(ii) operates in at least 2 counties; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b763-8\">(iii) is authorized by law to adjudicate contested cases.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A5h\">State Government Article \u00a7 10 \u2014 202(b). \u00a7 10-223(b) of the State Government Article, in pertinent part, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b763-9\">(b) <em>Right of Appeal. </em>\u2014 (1) A party who is aggrieved by a final judgment of a circuit court under this subtitle may appeal to the Court of Special Appeals in the manner that law provides for appeal of civil cases.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b763-10\">(2) An agency that was a party in the circuit court may appeal under paragraph (1) of this subsection.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b763-11\"> The Board of Port Wardens of Annapolis is not a unit of State government and does not operate in two counties. As a result, any right of appeal to the Court of Special Appeals must be found elsewhere in the Maryland Code, in the Anne Arundel County Code, or in the Annapolis City Code. No such right can be found in any of those codes.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-12\">As noted by the Circuit Court and the Court of Special Appeals, \u00a7 15.10.050(F) of the Annapolis City Code provides that \u201c[a] person aggrieved by a decision of the port wardens may appeal that decision to the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County.\u201d There is, however, no provision in state or local law that authorizes further review by the Court of Special Appeals. In <em>Beretta Corp., supra, </em>this Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AQu\">[A]s long as a circuit court is acting within its special statutory jurisdiction, the limitation upon the right to appeal is applicable regardless of the issues being raised. Except for a question of jurisdiction, the doctrine is a limitation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"734\">*734</page-number>upon the right to appeal and not upon the issues cognizable on appeal. Appeals have been precluded in cases involving legal issues, constitutional issues, issues concerning procedural irregularity, and issues about the lawful composition of an administrative agency.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b764-5\">358 Md. at 180, 747 A.2d at 654. The \u201cjurisdiction\u201d exception ordinarily applies to the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court, not to the jurisdiction of the administrative agency. As this Court stated in <em>Johnson v. Board of Zoning Appeals of Baltimore County, </em>196 Md. 400, 76 A.2d 736 (1950):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b764-6\">[I]t is not our province to consider the evidence and decide whether or not the [Circuit] Court made a proper decision in the light of the factors prescribed by the zoning regulations for the guidance of the Board of Zoning Appeals in granting a special permit. The question here is: Were the things complained of and decided by the Court below things which the Court had jurisdiction to decide? If the Court had the power to decide what it did decide, then its decision, whether right or wrong in point of law or fact, cannot be reviewed, because the power to review such a judgment has not been conferred by the Legislature upon the Court of Appeals.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b764-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 412, 76 A.2d at 741.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-8\">In the case at bar, there is no claim that the Circuit Court acted outside its jurisdiction, or that Petitioner actually sought \u201cmandamus\u201d relief from the Circuit Court. Petitioner\u2019s PETITION FOR JUDICIAL REVIEW expressly requested \u201cjudicial review of the actions of the Port Wardens[.]\u201d As the Circuit Court proceeding was a statutory judicial review action, we affirm the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals dismissing Petitioner\u2019s appeal \u201cfor lack of [appellate] jurisdiction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b764-9\">Jurisdiction of the Board of Port Wardens</p>\n<p id=\"b764-10\">Petitioner argues that (in the words of his brief) \u201c[t]he Port Wardens\u2019 decision approving the Application is void because the failure to give proper notice was fatal to the Port <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"735\">*735</page-number>Warden\u2019s jurisdiction over the issue.\u201d In support of this argument, Petitioner has identified three violations of the Annapolis, Md., Municipal Code: (1) a violation of \u00a7 15.16.040(A), which requires that the Port Wardens \u201ccause notice of the hearing on the [building permit] application to be published once in each week for two consecutive weeks,\u201d and (2) two violations of \u00a7 15.20.050, which required EYC to both (a) send a notice by certified mail to neighboring property owners \u201c[u]pon submission of a building permit application,\u201d and (b) \u201csubmit all return receipts from the certified mailings to the Board of Port Wardens at the hearing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b765-6\">According to Petitioner, his \u201cvoid for lack of jurisdiction\u201d argument is properly before this Court, and is controlled by <em>Cassidy v. Baltimore County Board of Appeals, et al., </em>218 Md. 418, 146 A.2d 896 (1958), in which we noted \u201cthat the failure of an administrative official or board to give a proper notice of a hearing, required by law, is fatal to the jurisdiction of the official or the board to conduct the hearing[.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 421-22, 146 A.2d at 898.

The Circuit Court rejected that argument, and the protestants <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"736\">*736</page-number>noted an appeal to this Court, which applied a \u201csubstantial compliance\u201d test to the notice at issue, and concluded that \u201cthe notice in this case was, at least, a substantial compliance with the requirements of all of the zoning regulations and those enumerated by Professor Merrill [in 2 <em>Merrill, Notice, </em>Sec. 796].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 425, 146 A.2d at 900.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-5\"><em>Cassidy </em>was cited in <em>Clark v. Wolman, </em>243 Md. 597, 221 A.2d 687 (1966), in which this Court considered the question of whether \u201cthe failure of an official to comply, literally, with the ordinance provisions relative to a [reclassification of property] invalidate the City [of Annapolis\u2019 reclassification] action[.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 598-99, 221 A.2d at 687. In <em>Clark, </em>after the City of Annapolis adopted a resolution granting appellees\u2019 request for \u2022a zoning reclassification, nearby property owners \u201cfiled a bill of complaint in the Circuit court seeking to have said resolution set aside.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 598, 221 A.2d at 688. The Circuit Court rejected appellants\u2019 argument that noncompliance with the notice requirement rendered the reclassification resolution \u201cunconstitutional, illegal and void.\u201d While affirming the judgment of the Circuit Court, this Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b766-6\">Appellants\u2019 brief states \u201cSection 26-59(c) of the Code * * * of Annapolis provides that notice shall be sent to the property owners within 175 feet\u201d of the subject property.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b766-7\">Appellants\u2019 argument here is rather technical and specious in nature. They claim that appellants Thomas D. Clark and Betty F. Clark, his wife, should have received written notice of the hearing by the City, and the failure to give them such written notice invalidated the City\u2019s action. However, they not only received constructive notice (by newspaper publication), but they also obtained actual and written notice from a property owners association. In addition, Mr. Clark saw the posted sign on the property sought to be classified, which also notified of the date of the hearing. As a matter of fact, Mr. Clark attended the hearing, where, according to his own admission, he was accorded the right to be heard, but made no protest. Mrs. Clark, although she had actual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"737\">*737</page-number>knowledge of the hearing stayed at home to look after the children.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b767-4\">The law, in its majesty, is not designed to require futile action or idle gestures. It is well settled that notification <em>purposed to inform </em>may be replaced by actual knowledge. 1 <em>Merrill, Notice, </em>480. And this is especially so when the knowledge has been acted upon without reliance upon the notification\u2019s absence or its defects. <em>Ibid,.; Cassidy v. Board of Appeals, </em>218 Md. 418, 146 A.2d 896 2 <em>Merrill, Notice, </em>384, 444.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b767-5\">In the instant case, the required notice to property owners within 175 feet was for the purpose of informing them of the hearing on the requested change. They had actual knowledge thereof and acted upon that knowledge. We hold that under the circumstances, Mr. and Mrs. Clark lost nothing from the failure to receive written notice of the hearing, and this failure did not invalidate the City\u2019s action.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b767-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 599-600, 221 A.2d at 688.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-7\">As the Circuit Court noted in its MEMORANDUM OPINION, \u201cEYC sent Petitioner notice of the administrative hearing by certified mail [but] Petitioner chose neither to attend the hearing nor to submit any written opposition to the Port Wardens.\u201d For the reasons stated in <em>Clark, supra, </em>because the record shows that he had actual knowledge that EYC\u2019s application would be considered by the Port Wardens at the June 27, 2006 hearing, Petitioner \u201clost nothing\u201d from the \u201crather technical\u201d failures of notice about which he complains. Under these circumstances, there is no merit in the argument that the administrative decision at issue is void <em>ab initio.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b767-8\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS AFFIRMED; PETITIONER TO PAY THE COSTS.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b763-13\">.
