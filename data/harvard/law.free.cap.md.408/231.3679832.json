Howard, </em>397 Md. 353, 918 A.2d 441 (2007), in the context of an in banc proceeding in the Court of Special Appeals, we found that more than 13 judges was too much. In <em>Wildwood Medical Center, L.L.C. v. Montgomery County, </em>405 Md. 489, 954 A.2d 457 (2008) (per curiam), in the context of a three-judge panel of that court, where the nominal author of the opinion in the case passed-away before a final opinion could be filed and the remaining judges split over the result, we found the number of judges too few. In the present case, we shall find that two judges in agreement are just right.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-6\">The common issue involved in this consolidated appeal of two cases is whether a judgment by the Court of Special Appeals is valid where one of the three judges on the panel that heard argument died before the case was decided, but the remaining two judges, agreeing on the reasoning and result, filed an opinion nonetheless. Following its purported decision in one of the cases involved here, the Court of Special Appeals denied the appellant\u2019s Motion to Recall Mandate, holding that a two-judge majority of a panel lawfully may decide an appeal despite the intervening death of the third judge on the panel. <em>Jackson v. State, </em>182 Md.App. 588, 597, 959 A.2d 84, 89 (2008). In doing so, the Court of Special Appeals distinguished this Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Wildwood, supra, </em>on the basis that <em>Wild-wood </em>applies \u201conly to cases in which one member of the panel [of the Court of Special Appeals] has passed away and the two remaining panel members disagree as to the decision.\u201d <em>Jackson, </em>182 Md.App. at 590, 959 A.2d at 85. For the reasons that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>follow, we affirm the judgments of the intermediate appellate court.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-4\">Relevant Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">\n<em>Jackson v. State</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b264-6\">On 9 January 2006, a jury sitting in the Circuit Court for Kent County convicted Brandon Jackson of distribution of cocaine and related offenses. Jackson noted a timely appeal to the Court of Special Appeals, challenging his convictions and sentences. A three-judge panel of the intermediate appellate court heard oral argument on 9 July 2007. The panel consisted of Judges Joseph F. Murphy, Jr., Raymond G. Thieme, Jr., and Theodore G. Bloom. Judge Murphy, at the time the panel heard oral argument, was Chief Judge of the Court of Special Appeals; however, by the time the opinion was filed in Jackson\u2019s appeal, he had been appointed by Governor O\u2019Malley to the Court of Appeals. Thus, as the author of the opinion in Jackson\u2019s case in the Court of Special Appeals, he was sitting as a recalled member of that court when the opinion was filed.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Judges Thieme and Bloom were retired judges specially assigned to the panel. Regrettably, Judge Bloom died six weeks after argument, while Jackson\u2019s appeal remained pending.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-7\">On 10 July 2008, in an unreported opinion authored by Judge Murphy, the Court of Special Appeals affirmed Jackson\u2019s convictions, but reversed one of his sentences. The cover page of the court\u2019s opinion noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-8\">Bloom, J. participated in the hearing of the case and in the conference in regard to its decision, but died prior to adoption of the opinion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b264-9\">Jackson filed in the Court of Special Appeals a Motion to Recall Mandate and a Motion for Reconsideration, asserting that the panel\u2019s purported decision was invalid because Judge Bloom died before it was issued. The intermediate appellate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>court, in a reported opinion in which Judge James P. Salmon replaced Judge Bloom on the panel, denied the motions. <em>Jackson v. State, </em>182 Md.App. 588, 959 A.2d 84 (2008). Jackson filed with this Court a Petition for a Writ of Certiorari, which we granted. <em>Jackson v. State, </em>406 Md. 443, 959 A.2d 792 (2008).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">\n<em>Glascoe v. State</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">On 5 November 2005, a jury sitting in the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County convicted Victor Glascoe of robbery and related handgun charges stemming from his robbing a 7-11 convenience store. Glascoe noted a timely appeal to the Court of Special Appeals. Oral argument in his case was heard on the same day as, and by the same panel that heard oral argument in, Jackson\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-7\">On 10 July 2008, the same day that the decision in Jackson\u2019s case was filed, the panel, in an unreported opinion also authored by Judge Murphy, affirmed Glascoe\u2019s convictions. The cover page of the opinion provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-8\">Theodore G. Bloom participated in the hearing of the case and in the conference in regard to its decision, but died prior to the adoption of the opinion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b265-9\">Glascoe filed with this Court a Petition for a Writ of Certiorari, which we granted, limited to the issue of the effect of Judge Bloom\u2019s passing on the extant decision of the intermediate appellate court. <em>Glascoe v. State, </em>406 Md. 443, 959 A.2d 792 (2008) .<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We consolidated Glascoe\u2019s case with that of Jackson.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b266-4\">This case principally concerns an interpretation of Section l-403(b) of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article of the Maryland Code. That section provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-5\">A case before the Court of Special Appeals shall be heard by a panel of not less than three judges. The panels shall be constituted, sit at the times, and hear the cases as directed by the Chief Judge from time to time. A quorum of a panel consists of one less than the number of judges designated to sit on the panel. The concurrence of a majority of a panel is necessary for the decision of a case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ALZ\">Maryland Code (2006 Repl. Vol.), Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article, \u00a7 l-403(b).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b266-6\">The principles that guide us when confronted with a matter of statutory interpretation are familiar. As recently stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-7\">In statutory interpretation, our primary goal is always \u201cto discern the legislative purpose, the ends to be accomplished, or the evils to be remedied by a particular provision, be it statutory, constitutional, or part of the Rules.\u201d We begin our analysis by first looking to the normal, plain meaning of the language of the statute, reading the statute as a whole to ensure that \u201c\u2018no word, clause, sentence or phrase is rendered surplusage, superfluous, meaningless or nugatory.\u2019 \u201d If the language of the statute is clear and unambiguous, we need not look beyond the statute\u2019s provisions and our analysis ends. If, however, the language is subject to more than one interpretation, or when the terms are ambiguous when it is part of a larger statutory scheme, it is ambiguous, and we endeavor to resolve that ambiguity by looking to the statute\u2019s legislative history, case law, statutory purpose, as well as the structure of the statute.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b266-8\"><em>Int'l Ass\u2019n of Fire Fighters, Local 1715 v. Mayor of Cumberland, </em>407 Md. 1, 8-9, 962 A.2d 374, 378-79 (2008) (internal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>citations omitted); <em>Doe v. Montgomery County Bd. of Elections, </em>406 Md. 697, 712, 962 A.2d 342, 350-51 (2008) (internal citations omitted); <em>Supervisor of Assessments v. Stellar GT, </em>406 Md. 658, 669-70, 961 A.2d 1119, 1125-26 (2008) (internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b267-4\">The flagship contention of Jackson and Glascoe (collectively \u201cPetitioners\u201d) is that, by the plain language of Section 1-403(b), \u201ca panel of not less than three judges\u201d must exist at all times from the moment the panel convenes to hear an appeal up to and including the moment in which the panel renders its decision on the appeal, i.e., flies its opinion. Petitioners asseverate that, because the panel that decided their cases became a panel of two judges upon the death of Judge Bloom, the decisions by the remaining majority of judges on the panel were nullities. This is not the correct interpretation of the statutory provision at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-5\">Facially, Section l-403(b) does not mandate that \u201ca panel of not less than three judges\u201d must decide an appeal. The language, \u201ca panel of not less than three judges,\u201d proscribes who must <em>hear </em>an appeal. As for who may decide the appeal, however, Section l-403(b) is silent, directing only that the \u201cconcurrence of the majority of a panel is necessary for the decision.\u201d The statutory language does not elucidate whether the death (or vacation of office) of a panel member who heard an appeal causes the initial panel to dissolve, such that the remaining judges, if less than three, may not render a valid decision. Section l-403(b) is ambiguous in this regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-6\">Review of the circumstances and legislative history surrounding 1983 amendments to Section l-403(b), however, provides significant guidance on the matter. Before 1983, the statute provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-7\">A case before the Court of Special Appeals shall be heard <em>and decided </em>by a panel of not less than three judges. The panels shall be constituted, sit at the times, and hear the cases as directed by the Chief Judge from time to time. A quorum of a panel consists of one less than the number of judges designated to sit on a panel, <em>but never less than three </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number><em>judges. </em>The concurrence of a majority of a panel is necessary for the decision of a case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b268-4\">Md. Code (1980 Repl. Vol.), Cts. <em>&amp; </em>Jud. Proc. Art., \u00a7 l-408(b) (italics added). On 23 December 1982, however, the Honorable John P. Moore of the Court of Special Appeals died, prompting \u201cemergency\u201d legislation designed to avoid the need to reargue cases that were heard by panels on which he sat and heard argument. On 25 February 1983, Delegate Joseph Owens, Chair of the House Judiciary Committee, sponsored House Bill 1511, which provided as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-5\">SECTION 1. BE IT ENACTED BY THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF MARYLAND, That the Laws of Maryland read as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-6\"><em>Article </em>\u2014 Courts <em>and Judicial Proceedings 1-j.OS.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-7\">(b) A case before the Court of Special Appeals shall be heard [and decided] by a panel of not less than three judges. The panels shall be constituted, sit at the times, and hear the cases as directed by the Chief Judge from time to time. A quorum of a panel consists of one less than the number of judges designated to sit on the panel[, but never less than three judges]. The concurrence of a majority of a panel is necessary for the decision of a case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-8\">SECTION 2. AND BE IT FURTHER ENACTED, That this Act shall apply to all cases in the Court of Special Appeals in which the mandate has not been issued as of the effective date of this Act.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-9\">SECTION 3. AND BE IT FURTHER ENACTED, That this Act is hereby declared to be an emergency measure and necessary for the immediate preservation of the public health and safety and having been passed by a yes and nay vote supported by three-fifths of all the members elected to each of the two Houses of the General Assembly, the same shall take effect from the date of its passage.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b268-10\">H.B. 1511 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b268-11\">Additionally, the Department of Legislative Reference\u2019s summary of House Bill 1511, prepared for the Senate Judicial Proceedings Committee, provided the following insight:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>\n<em>SUMMARY OF BILL:</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-4\">This bill amends the existing law by repealing the requirement that a case before the Court of Special Appeals must be decided by the full panel of three judges which heard the case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-5\">The bill leaves intact the provision that a majority of the panel which hears the case must concur in its decision. The bill is an emergency measure.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-6\">\n<em>BACKGROUND:</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-7\">The law presently provides that cases must be heard and decided by a panel of three judges. In light of the recent death of a member of the Court, numerous cases will have to be reheard to get a decision by 3 judges unless this bill is passed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-8\">\n<em>LEGISLATIVE INTENT:</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-9\">The intent of the bill is to provide for the decision of cases heard by full panel of the Court of Special Appeals in the event of the removal, death, or disability of a judge on a panel.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b269-10\">Summary of Committee Report for H.B. 1511 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b269-11\">Governor Harry Hughes signed House Bill 1511 into law on 25 March 1983. Act of March 25, 1983, ch. 6. Commenting on the change to Section l-408(b), this Court previously observed that it was intended \u201cto remove the requirement that the Court of Special Appeals <em>decide </em>cases by a panel of three judges.\u201d <em>Howard, </em>397 Md. at 361 n. 13, 918 A.2d at 446 n. 13 (italics in original). The revised Section l-403(b), we elaborated, \u201callows the court the flexibility to hear cases in three-judge panels and still render a two judge majority decision in the event that one member of the panel is unable to participate in the decision-making phase of the case.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b269-12\">The present cases fall squarely within the circumstances embraced and contemplated by the 1983 amendments to Section l-403(b). Judge Bloom\u2019s passing notwithstanding, the remaining judges sitting on the panel that was convened to hear Petitioners\u2019 cases constituted a quorum. Because they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>were in agreement as to the reasoning and outcomes of Petitioners\u2019 cases, there was a \u201cconcurrence of a majority of [the] panel.\u201d <em>See </em>Md.Code, Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. Art., \u00a7 1 \u2014 403(b). Accordingly, the decisions rendered in Petitioners\u2019 cases by the Court of Special Appeals are valid.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">Petitioners, citing this Court\u2019s recent decision in <em>Wildwood, supra, </em>nonetheless maintain that the decisions in their cases were nullities. The procedural posture of <em>Wildwood </em>also arose from the passing of Judge Bloom; however, there, we considered whether the intermediate appellate court issued a valid decision, where the opinion was written purportedly by Judge Bloom, despite being filed after his death. 405 Md. at 494, 954 A.2d at 460. Moreover, the remaining judges on the panel on which Judge Bloom sat disagreed with each other over the outcome of the case before them. <em>Id. </em>We held that the opinion and mandate in <em>Wildwood </em>were nullities because no one was \u201cauthorized to submit the decision on [Judge Bloom]\u2019s behalf.\u201d <em>Wildwood, </em>405 Md. at 495, 954 A.2d at 461.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-6\">Petitioners attempt to draw succor from language in <em>Wild-wood </em>in which we emphasized as pertinent to our holding that \u201cthere was no longer a panel of three judges to hear and decide th[e] appeal.\u201d 405 Md. at 495, 954 A.2d at 461. Petitioners\u2019 reliance on that language here, however, is misplaced. While it is true that the fact that there no longer existed a three-judge panel to decide the appeal was a significant consideration in <em>Wildwood, </em>the reason for that significance was that the disagreement between the two remaining judges precluded the possibility of a \u201cconcurrence of [the] majority of [the] panel.\u201d <em>See </em>Md.Code, Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. Art., \u00a7 1 \u2014 403(b). Stated succinctly, the need that existed in <em>Wild-wood, </em>for a panel of three judges to hear and decide the appeal, does not exist here, where we have a \u201cconcurrence of a majority of [the] panel,\u201d despite the loss of the third judge on the panel. <em>See </em>Md.Code, Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. Art., \u00a7 l-403(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b270-7\">Petitioners next argue that public policy favors their interpretation of Section 1-403(b). They urge that an opinion by a panel of appellate judges should reflect the end result of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>collective decision-making process of all of the judges assigned to the panel. They maintain that the appellate process, from the hearing until the time the decision is filed, is designed to bring \u201cmultiple judicial viewpoints\u201d into the discussion of how the panel should resolve the appeal before it. Thus, in order to facilitate the purpose of the appellate process, they claim, the panel convened to hear argument in a given case must always exist as a panel of not less than three judges until a decision is reached (or a new panel formed). To that end, Petitioners seek support from this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Howard, supra. </em>There, we held that the statutory provision enabling the Court of Special Appeals to hear and decide cases in banc did not permit for retired judges, who were specially assigned to the earlier panel that initially heard a case, to participate in proceedings in banc. <em>Howard, </em>397 Md. at 371, 918 A.2d at 453. In doing so, we observed in passing that the two retired, specially assigned judges who participated in the in banc proceeding at issue were split, with one voting with the majority and the other voting with the dissent; however, we commented that we could not presume the same end result would obtain in the case on remand, absent the participation of the specially assigned judges. <em>Howard, </em>397 Md. at 369 n. 18, 918 A.2d at 451 n. 18. \u201c[T]he dynamics of conferencing and deciding a case,\u201d we noted, \u201cis sometimes a delicate process influenced by the presence or absence of certain judges.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">The above quoted language from <em>Howard </em>is not helpful to Petitioners here. In <em>Howard, </em>the purpose of pointing out the impact of a judge\u2019s presence or absence was to clarify why it was necessary for this Court to remand the matter, despite the fact that the two specially assigned judges participating in the in banc proceeding and decision (together with the 13 incumbent members of the court) effectively cancelled-out each other\u2019s votes. <em>Id. </em>Here, unlike <em>Howard, </em>the panel members who rendered decisions in Petitioners\u2019 cases acted within the purview of the General Assembly\u2019s grant of authority. Thus, we need not consider whether a different result might obtain on remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>We note that whatever wisdom there may be in Petitioners\u2019 assertion \u2014 that it is better public policy to require that panels of not less than three judges hear <em>and </em>decide appeals, even when two judges on the panel are in concurrence despite the loss of the third judge on the panel \u2014 was resolved by the Legislature in the 1983 amendments to Section l-403(b). We shall not revisit the judgment of the General Assembly.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-4\">JUDGMENTS OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS AFFIRMED; COSTS TO BE PAID BY PETITIONERS.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b263-7\">. <em>Three Bears, in </em>2 Funk &amp; Wagnalls Standard Dictionary of Folklore Mythology and Legend 1110 (Maria Leach ed., Funk &amp; Wagnalls Co. 1950).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b264-10\">.
