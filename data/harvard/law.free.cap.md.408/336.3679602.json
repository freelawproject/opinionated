After a hearing was held, an Order was issued on February 2, 2008, by the Associate Deputy Commissioner, deciding that the Division had standing and ordering \u201cthat Allstate Insurance Company and Allstate Indemnity Company be and hereby are found to have met the requirements of \u00a7 19-107 of the Insurance Article; ... that [they] ... are found not to have violated \u00a7 27-501 of the Insurance Article; and ... that, a final decision on the hearing is rendered in favor of Allstate.... \u201d From this Order, the Division sought judicial review in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City, and Allstate moved for dismissal, arguing that the Division lacked standing to seek judicial review. The Judge granted Allstate\u2019s motion, holding that because the Division was not a \u201cparty\u201d to the hearing before the Commissioner, it could not seek judicial review under Section 2-215 of the Insurance Article. The Division appealed to the Court of Special Appeals, and Allstate petitioned this Court for certiorari prior to any proceedings before the Court of Special Appeals, asking us to review the trial judge\u2019s decision to dismiss. We granted Allstate\u2019s petition and shall address the following question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-4\">Whether the General Assembly authorized the People\u2019s Insurance Counsel Division to file a petition for judicial review from a final decision of the Insurance Commissioner.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">We shall hold that the Division is a party in matters before the Insurance Commissioner, that this constituted such a matter, and that as a party, the Division may seek judicial review from an order of the Commissioner under Section 2-215(b) of the Insurance Article.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-6\">I. Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b370-7\">On December 4, 2006, Allstate notified the Insurance Commissioner, pursuant to Section 19-107 of the Insurance Article,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> that it intended to stop accepting new homeowners insur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>anee business in certain \u201ccatastrophe prone\u201d areas, which potentially involved a large number of consumers in Maryland. Between December 2006 and May 28, 2007, the Maryland Insurance Administration conducted a review of the filing,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and on May 31, 2007, the Administration e-mailed its \u201cposition\u201d to Allstate:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-4\">RE: Allstate Filings R17710, R 17712 &amp; R 17214. Dear Mr. Wisniewski: The Maryland Insurance Administration has thoroughly reviewed the filings made under Section 19-107 of the Insurance Article by Allstate Insurance Company and Allstate Indemnity Company as referenced above. Based on the information submitted and this review, the Administration has concluded that the designation has an objective basis and is neither arbitrary nor unreasonable. Obviously, if additional information is provided or if the underlying data changes, this may change the Administration\u2019s position.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">On June 1, 2007, the Division requested a hearing before the Insurance Commissioner, alleging that Allstate\u2019s filing was not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>in compliance with Section 19-107, governing \u201cnonwrites.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Specifically, the Division contended that the \u201cdesignation of the geographic area does not have an objective basis,\u201d and that the \u201cdesignation is arbitrary and unreasonable,\u201d because Allstate made \u201cno showing that its existing rate structure or an actuarially-based rate change is inadequate to show the extent that \u2018the rate is unreasonably low for the insurance provided and continued use of the rate would endanger the solvency of the insurer\u2019 per Md.Code. Ann. Ins. \u00a7 11-806(a)(3).\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The Division also requested a stay of the \u201cnon-write\u201d filing, which would become effective on June 4, 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-4\">On July 2, 2007, The Interim Insurance Commissioner granted the Division\u2019s request for a hearing but denied the stay request, stating, in pertinent part, that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-5\">[The Division\u2019s] request for a hearing on behalf of the People\u2019s Insurance Counsel Division (PICD) is hereby granted.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-6\">4- 4: *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>[The Division\u2019s] request for a hearing does not stay the implementation of Allstate\u2019s filings. Those filings were not subject to prior approval by the Administration and the Administration issued no order approving the implementation of the filings. By statute, the filings may be implemented 60 days after they are filed. Preventing the implementation of the filings would require an affirmative order by the Administration, based on a finding that the filings did not meet the statutory criteria. Hence, while I have recognized the standing of PICD to request a hearing on the Administration\u2019s decision not to order Allstate to halt the implementation of its filings (as amended), there is no affirmative order of the Administration which is subject to being stayed by [the Division\u2019s] request.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b373-4\">Allstate filed a motion to intervene and a motion to dismiss the Division\u2019s request for a hearing, asserting that the Division lacked standing to challenge its filing. In an \u201cOrder on Motions,\u201d dated August 31, 2007, the Interim Commissioner granted Allstate\u2019s request to intervene in the hearing,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> but denied its motion to dismiss, preliminarily determining that the Division had \u201cstanding to pursue this proceeding.\u201d A hearing was held in December of 2007, and four issues were presented:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-5\">1. Does PICD have standing to request a hearing?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-6\">2. When an insurer makes a filing pursuant to Ins. \u00a7 19-107, in which the insurer designates a geographic area in the state in which the insurer plans to refuse to issue or renew motor vehicle, property or casualty insurance, is the underwriting standard by which the geographic designation will be implemented exempted from the Insurance Article\u2019s prohibition on discrimination in underwriting, which is set forth in Ins. \u00a7 27-501?[<footnotemark>9</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>3. Did Allstate satisfy its burden of showing that its underwriting standard, upon which it will base its refusal to write new homeowner\u2019s business in Hurricane Bands 4-6, actually exists, is lawful, and will be applied in a manner that is reasonably related to Allstate\u2019s business and economic purposes, as required by Ins. \u00a7 27-501?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-4\">4. Did Allstate satisfy its burden of demonstrating, as required by Ins. \u00a7 19-107, that its designation of the geographic area in which it will refuse new business has an objective basis and is not arbitrary or unreasonable?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">At the termination of the hearing, an associate deputy commissioner,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> in a written memorandum, determined:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-6\">I. PICD had standing to request a hearing on this matter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-7\">II. In light of PICD\u2019s challenge to Allstate\u2019s decision to cease writing new business in designated coastal regions, Allstate had the burden of persuasion to demonstrate: that the underwriting standard to be applied to refuse coverage in the designated areas is not discriminatory and was reasonably related to Allstate\u2019s business and economic purposes, as required by Ins. \u00a7 27-501, and that the geographic designation upon which Allstate based its refusal to issue new homeowner\u2019s business was objective and was not arbitrary or unreasonable.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-8\">III. Allstate has satisfied its burden, pursuant to \u00a7 27-501, of showing that its underwriting standard, by which it will refuse new homeowner\u2019s business in Hurricane Bands 4-6 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>actually exists, is not discriminatory, and is reasonably related to its business and economic purposes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-4\">IV. Allstate has satisfied its burden of showing it has complied with Ins. \u00a7 19-107 by filing a timely geographic designation reflecting the areas in which it will cease to writing new homeowner\u2019s business because Allstate\u2019s timely designation is objective, reasonable, and not arbitrary.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">With respect to the Division\u2019s standing, the associate deputy commissioner interpreted Section 6-306 of the State Government Article and determined that it provided the Division with the ability to represent consumers at-large:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-6\">PICD was created by the Maryland General Assembly during its special session in December 2004. The purpose of the PICD is to protect, through statutorily prescribed means, the interests of persons insured under policies of medical professional liability or homeowner\u2019s policies issued or delivered in the State. The PICD is authorized, in pertinent part, to do the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-7\">(a)(1) The Division shall evaluate each medical professional liability insurance and homeowner\u2019s insurance matter pending before the Commissioner to determine whether the interests of insurance consumers are affected.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-8\">(2) If the Division determines that the interests of insurance consumers are affected, the Division may appear before the Commissioner and courts on behalf of insurance consumers in each matter or proceeding....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-9\">(c) As the Division considers necessary, the Division shall conduct investigations and request the Commissioner to initiate an action or proceeding to protect the interests of insurance consumers.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-10\">State Gov\u2019t \u00a7 6-306.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-11\">Allstate challenges the standing of PICD to a request a hearing in this matter on the grounds that PICD is not an \u201caggrieved person,\u201d citing the case of <em>Sugarloaf Citizens\u2019 Ass\u2019n v. Dep\u2019t of Env\u2019t, </em>344 Md. 271, 288, 686 A.2d 605 (1996). It is true that the Commissioner has relied upon the <em>Sugarloaf </em>case in the past when it has ruled that organiza<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>tions lack standing. <em>See, e.g., </em>Final Order, <em>Allan Pollack, M.D. et al. v. United Healthcare Insurance Company, </em>MIA-2005-12101. However, unlike associations such as Med Chi, which have been denied administrative standing by the Commissioner in the past, PICD has been granted authority by the General Assembly to act on behalf of insurance consumers in this State and to protect the interests of those consumers. Thus, there is a meaningful difference between the status of an association and the PICD, which is statutorily authorized to participate in proceedings before the Commissioner.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">The ruling continued by differentiating two prior determinations of the Insurance Administration, <em>Maryland Insurance Administration (Ex Rel David &amp; Delores Finney) v. Standard Fire Insurance Company, </em>Case No. MIA-2006008-22, and <em>Maryland Insurance Administration (Ex Rel Lenora Stevenson) v. Erie Insurance Exchange, </em>Case No. MIA-2006-07-24, wherein the Commissioner determined that the Division lacked standing to seek a formal hearing. Recognizing that these cases involved \u201cindividual consumer complaints arising from a proposed non-renewal of homeowner\u2019s insurance policies,\u201d whereas the \u201cinstant case\u201d involved Allstate\u2019s decision to cease wilting new homeowner\u2019s insurance having a \u201cwidespread impact\u201d affecting many consumers, the associate deputy commissioner ruled that the Division had standing because it \u201cis authorized to protect the interest of such insurance consumers.\u201d In addressing Allstate\u2019s other contention, that the Division lacked standing because it is only authorized to act as legal representative to \u201cinsurance consumers,\u201d <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> but could not request a hearing without an individual consumer complaint, the ruling continued that, by requesting a hearing, the Division was fulfilling the precise duty for which it was created- \u2014 to act on behalf of a class of insurance consumers generally:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b377-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>Through its hearing request and participation at the hearing, PICD is acting on behalf of the class of insurance consumers it was created to protect. First, if Allstate ceases to write new business in a particular geographic area, that is one less option available for consumers who have purchased homeowner\u2019s coverage from an Allstate competitor, but who may wish to consider other coverage arrangements. In this way, Allstate\u2019s action would, in fact, impact current insurance consumers. Second, I disagree with Allstate that the PICD was intended to protect only its existing policyholders. Unlawful underwriting, by its very nature, would deny coverage to an applicant. Adoption of Allstate\u2019s interpretation of the statute would effectively gut the authority of PICD to challenge unlawful underwriting decisions. I do not believe that this is the result the legislature intended.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b377-5\">For these reasons, 1 conclude that by initiating this proceeding PICD is protecting the interests of \u201cinsurance consumers\u201d as that term is defined in \u00a7 6 \u2014 801(f) of the State Government Article and that, under the circumstances presented in this case, the legislature has granted PICD had standing to a request a hearing pursuant to Ins. \u00a7 2-210.[<footnotemark>12</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b377-6\">The memorandum concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b377-7\">WHEREFORE, it is hereby:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b377-8\">ORDERED, that Allstate Insurance Company and Allstate Indemnity Company, be an hereby are found to have met <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>the requirements of \u00a7 19-107 of the Insurance Article; and it is further</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-4\">ORDERED, that Alstate Insurance Company and Allstate Indemnity Company be, and hereby are found not to have violated \u00a7 27-501 of the Insurance Article; and it is further</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AGAJ\">ORDERED that, a final decision on the hearing is rendered in favor of Allstate Insurance Company and Allstate Indemnity Company____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">On February 29, 2008, the Division filed a Petition for Judicial Review in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City. Alstate filed a Motion to Dismiss the Petition for Judicial Review and Request for a Hearing, arguing that the Division did not have standing to seek judicial review, because it was neither a \u201cparty\u201d nor an \u201caggrieved\u201d person, and that the Legislature did not intend to grant the Division power to appear as a party without representing an individual complainant. Ater numerous other motions and memoranda were filed, a hearing was held before a Judge of the Circuit Court of Baltimore City. In an order filed July 15, 2008, the Judge granted Alstate\u2019s Motion to Dismiss, ruling that the Division did not have standing to seek judicial review, as it was not a \u201cparty\u201d to the hearing before the Commissioner, because the Legislature had only granted the Division \u201cthe rights of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>counsel to a party to a proceeding\u201d in Section 6-307 of the State Government Article. Because the Division was not a \u201cparty\u201d to the hearing, the Judge continued, it was not eligible to seek judicial review under Section 2-215 of the Insurance Article:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b379-5\">(1) In appearances before the Commissioner and courts on behalf of insurance consumers, the People\u2019s Insurance Counsel Division (PICD) has \u201cthe rights of counsel to a party\u201d to the proceeding. MD. CODE ANN. STATE GOV\u2019T \u00a7 6-307 (2008). The Insurance Article of the Maryland Annotated Code provides that an appeal of an order of the Insurance Commissioner following a hearing may be taken by either (1) a party to the hearing; or (2) an aggrieved person whose financial interests are directly affected by the order resulting from a hearing or refusal to grant a hearing. MD. CODE ANN. INS. \u00a7 2-215(b) (2008). The PICD does not have the right to appear as a party to a proceeding before the Commissioner or before a court and cannot become a party by participating in a hearing as counsel to a party.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b379-6\">(2) The Insurance Commissioner did not have the authority to grant the PICD standing to appear as a party to a hearing before the Commission as the PICD has only been granted \u201cthe rights of counsel to a party\u201d to a proceeding before the Commission.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b379-7\">In addressing the Division\u2019s contention that this Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Public Serv. Comm\u2019n v. Maryland People\u2019s Counsel, </em>309 Md. 1, 522 A.2d 369 (1987), conclusively determined that the Legislature intended that the Division have the ability to have standing as a party before courts when protecting the interests of consumers, the Judge distinguished the Public Service Commission from the Insurance Administration, observing, in particular, that Section 3-202 of the Public Utility Companies Article explicitly states that the People\u2019s Counsel can seek judicial review,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> whereas Section 2-215 of the Insurance Article makes no such explicit reference to the Division:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>(3) Although the respective functions of the PICD and Office of the People\u2019s Counsel (OPC) are similar in some respects, their enabling statutes differ in a significant way. Both entities have been expressly provided \u201cthe rights of counsel to a party\u201d to the proceeding before the Commission and courts on behalf of consumers (PICD) or residential and noncommercial users (OPC) (Compare Md.Code Ann. State Gov\u2019t \u00a7 6-307(a) and Md.Code Ann. Pub. Util. Cos. \u00a7 2-205(a)); the right to appear before any federal or State tribunal or agency, in a judicial or administrative action, to protect the interests of consumers or residential and noncommercial users (compare Md.Code Ann. State Gov\u2019t 6-307(b) and Md.Code Ann. Pub. Util. Cos. 2-205(b)); and the right to appear before the Commission and courts on behalf of consumers or residential and noncommercial users in each matter or proceeding over which the Commission has original jurisdiction, if the PICD or OPC determines that the interest of insurance consumers or residential and noncommercial users are affected. (Compare Md.Code Ann. State Gov\u2019t \u00a7 6-206(a)(2) and Md.Code Ann. Pub. Util. Cos. \u00a7 2-204(a)(2)).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-5\">However, the Legislature has expressly conferred only upon the OPC the power to seek judicial review of a final decision or order of the Commission if the OPC is dissatisfied with the final decision or order. <em>(See </em>Md.Code Ann. Pub. Util. Cos. \u00a7 3-202(a) (2008)). No comparable provision exists for the PICD. Thus, because the PICD has not been expressly authorized by statute to seek judicial review of a commissioner\u2019s final decision or order, it may not do so on its own behalf, and because the PICD does not represent any individual consumers in this action, it may not seek judicial review in the case <em>sub judice.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b380-6\">Both the Division and the Maryland Insurance Commissioner noted appeals to the Court of Special Appeals, and Allstate, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>thereafter, petitioned this Court for certiorari. <em>People\u2019s Ins. v.

Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b381-6\">We are tasked with interpreting Chapter 5 of the Maryland Patients\u2019 Access to Quality Health Care Act, enacted during the 2004 Special Session,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark>which created and prescribed the powers and duties of the People\u2019s Insurance Counsel Division, as well as portions of the Insurance Article governing judicial review of orders of the Insurance Commissioner and hearings before the Insurance Commissioner. Our analysis is limited to whether the Division may initiate a judicial review action, rather than the merits of the controversy, because the Circuit Court\u2019s ruling was confined to the standing issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-7\">In statutory interpretation, our primary goal is always \u201cto discern the legislative purpose, the ends to be accomplished, or the evils to be remedied by a particular provision, be it statutory, constitutional or part of the Rules.\u201d <em>Barbre v. Pope, </em>402 Md. 157, 172, 935 A.2d 699, 708 (2007); <em>Gen. Motors Corp. v. Seay, </em>388 Md. 341, 352, 879 A.2d 1049, 1055 (2005). <em>See also Dep\u2019t of Health &amp; Mental Hygiene v.

We begin our analysis by first looking to the normal, plain meaning of the language of the statute, reading the statute as a whole to ensure that \u201c \u2018no word, clause, sentence or phrase is rendered surplusage, superfluous, meaningless or nugatory.\u2019 \u201d <em>Barbre, </em>402 Md. at 172, 935 A.2d at 708; <em>Kelly, </em>397 Md. at 420, 918 A.2d at 482. <em>See also Kane v. Bd. of Appeals of Prince George\u2019s County, </em>390 Md. 145, 167, 887 A.2d 1060, 1073 (2005). If the language of the statute is clear and unambiguous, we need not look beyond the statute\u2019s provisions, and our analysis ends. <em>Barbre, </em>402 Md. at 173, 935 A.2d at 708-09; <em>Kelly, </em>397 Md. at 419, 918 A.2d at 482; <em>City of Frederick v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number><em>Pickett, </em>392 Md. 411, 427, 897 A.2d 228, 237 (2006).

The Division and the Maryland Insurance Administration, which is another appellant before us, argue that the plain meaning of Section 2-215 of the Insurance Article and Sections 6-301 <em>et seq. </em>of the State Government <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>Article, grant the Division \u201cparty\u201d status in hearings before the Commissioner and the ability to seek judicial review. They also posit that the Legislature, in enacting the statute establishing the Division, intended to mimic the Office of the People\u2019s Counsel of the Public Service Commission, as evidenced by the similarities between the language and structure of the statutes prescribing the functions and powers of the entities, and that as a result, our opinion in <em>PSC v. MPC, </em>309 Md. at 1, 522 A.2d at 369, granting party status to the PSC\u2019s People\u2019s Counsel, should apply to the Division.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-4\">Allstate responds by asserting that the Legislature did not grant the Division the power to appear as a party before the Insurance Commissioner in a matter where no complaint has been lodged, and alternatively, that as a party, the Division could not seek judicial review, because there was no matter pending before the Commissioner. Allstate also contends that to interpret the statute as permitting the Division to have the power of judicial review, would be to interpret it in a way that creates a conflict of interest, because the Division is housed within the Office of the Attorney General and the Office of the Attorney General represents the Maryland Insurance Administration.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">The first issue that we address is whether the Legislature intended to confer upon the Division the status of \u201cparty,\u201d when representing the interest of consumers generally before the Maryland Insurance Commissioner. The language primarily in dispute is, \u201cthe Division has the <em>rights of counsel for a party to the proceeding,\u201d </em>(emphasis added) from Section 6-307(a) of the State Government Article. The language of subsection (b), \u201c[t]he Division may appear before any federal or State tribunal or agency, in a judicial or administrative action, to protect the interests of insurance consumers,\u201d is also of import. While the Division asserts that the language clearly supports its party status, Allstate asserts that the Legislature would have added the words \u201cas a party,\u201d as it did in Section 2-202(b)(2) of the Insurance Article (granting the Human Relations Commission the power to \u201cappear before the Commissioner <em>as a party </em>at a hearing about discriminatory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>practices\u201d (emphasis added)), had it intended to confer party-status upon the Division. Similarly, Allstate compares the judicial review provision in Section 3-202 of the Public Utility Companies Article with the judicial review provision in Section 2-215 of the Insurance Article, observing that the Public Utility Companies Article explicitly makes the Office of the People\u2019s Counsel a \u201cparty or person in interest,\u201d while such explication is omitted in Section 2-215 of the Insurance Article. Allstate also argues that other bills proposed at the time of the bill adopting the Division would have explicitly conferred party status upon the Division, but none of these bills was adopted.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-4\">We disagree with Allstate. Allstate\u2019s argument that the Division has only the rights of counsel, but not the standing of a party, is too narrowly focused on the language of Section 6-307(a) of the State Government Article (\u201cIn appearances before the Commissioner and courts on behalf of insurance consumers, the Division has the rights of counsel for a party to the proceeding____\u201d), without sufficiently accounting for the language of subsection (b) (\u201cThe Division may appear before any federal or State tribunal or agency, in a judicial or administrative action, to protect the interests of insurance consumers.\u201d). Looking at the normal, plain meaning of the words used and reading the statute as a whole, so that no phrase or clause is rendered nugatory, it is clear that subsection (a) is aimed at prescribing <em>what </em>the Division may do when appearing before the Commission or courts, whereas subsection (b) is intended to prescribe <em>when </em>the Division may appear. Thus, so long as the Division is appearing \u201cto protect the interests of insurance consumers,\u201d as they are here, they may appear as a \u201cparty\u201d to the proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-7\">This interpretation, furthermore, is consistent with our decision in <em>PSC v. MPC, </em>in which the PSC argued that the PSC People\u2019s Counsel was not intended to be a \u201cparty\u201d in proceedings before courts. We concluded, interpreting a statute nearly identical to the one prescribing powers to the Division,<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number><footnotemark>16</footnotemark> that the People\u2019s Counsel had the ability to appear as a party when appearing on behalf of consumers:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-4\">The Commission also argues that the rights of People\u2019s Counsel are not threatened. This argument is misfocused because the relevant legal rights are not those of individuals comprising the Office of People\u2019s Counsel, but those of the residential customers that People\u2019s Counsel is statutorily obligated to protect. As previously stated, People\u2019s Counsel has the power to bring suit \u201con behalf of [residential] users in all matters or proceedings over which the Commission has original jurisdiction.\u201d Maryland Code (1957, 1980 Repl. Yol.), Art. 78, \u00a7 15(a). Thus, <em>People\u2019s Counsel brings suit under \u00a7 89 not to protect his oum rights, but to protect the rights of all residential utility customers in Maryland.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"A1g\"><em>PSC v. MPC, </em>309 Md. at 10 n. 3, 522 A.2d at 373 n. 3 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">Allstate, however, proffers two consolidated determinations of the Insurance Commissioner, <em>Maryland, Insurance Administration v. Standard Fire Insurance Company, </em>Case No. MIA-2006-08-22, and <em>Maryland Insurance Administration v. Erie Insurance Exchange, </em>Case No. MIA-2006-07-24, to further its contention that, unlike the PSC People\u2019s Counsel, the Legislature only intended that the Division be capable of representing specific consumers before the Commissioner, in these two determinations, the issue addressed was \u201cwhether the P1CD ... has standing to initiate or to continue a hearing before the Maryland Insurance Administration (MIA) in an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>individual consumer complaint where the consumer whose complaint initiated the case elected not to proceed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1. In both cases, the Insurance Commissioner determined that the Division did not have standing to request a healing when the individual complainant withdrew, because a \u201cconsumer complaint is a complaint that is initiated by an individual who has been personally and directly harmed by an action of an insurance company and who asks the [Maryland Insurance Administration] to force the company to reverse their action and, thereby, come into compliance with the law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 12. He reasoned, moreover, that the Division, on the other hand, was empowered to evaluate \u201cmatter[s] <em>pending </em>before the Commissioner to determine whether the interest of insurance consumers are affected,\u201d and \u201cshall conduct investigations and request the Commissioner <em>to initiate </em>an action or proceeding to protect the interests of insurance consumers,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 13 (emphasis in original), rather than to intervene in the unique circumstances of any particular consumer. The Commissioner, thus, concluded that in cases of consumer complaints, the Legislature intended that the Division assume a role similar to that of \u201can <em>amicus </em>participant in an appellate proceeding,\u201d because \u201cin a consumer complaint hearing,\u201d the question is \u201cwhether an insurer violated the law with respect to a specific policyholder on a specific policy,\u201d which \u201cwould not have a direct and immediate financial impact on other policyholders.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 17, 20.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">In contrast, in this case, involving the decision not to write insurance in a geographic area, the financial impact is on many policyholders rather than one specific policyholder or a specific policy. The Division, moreover, was created specifically for the purpose of evaluating matters affecting insurance consumers, Section 6-306(a)(l) of the State Government Article, and was granted the explicit power to appear \u201cin a judicial or administrative action, <em>to protect the interest of insurance consumers.\u201d </em>Section 6-307(b) (emphasis added). As a result, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>we conclude that the Division has standing to appear as a party in a matter pending before the Commissioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-4\">Allstate argues, thereafter, that the lack of explicit language in the judicial review statute of the Insurance Article is illustrative of legislative intent not to permit the Division to seek judicial review. The Circuit Court Judge found this argument to be determinative, when she compared the judicial review provision of the Public Service Companies Article (\u201ca party or person in interest, including the People\u2019s Counsel, that is dissatisfied by a final decision or order of the Commission may seek judicial review of the decision ...\u201d) to the judicial review provision of the Insurance Article (stating that only \u201ca party to a hearing\u201d or an \u201caggrieved person\u201d may seek judicial review), and ruled that the absence of language explicitly referencing the Division in the Insurance Article was dispositive.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">In this respect, we disagree with Allstate and with the Circuit Court Judge, based on the legislative intent to copy the PSC People\u2019s Counsel when creating the Division, and our opinion in <em>PSC v. MPC, </em>309 Md. at 1, 522 A.2d at 369. The Revised Fiscal and Policy Note contained in the bill file for the Maryland Patients\u2019 Access to Quality Health Care Act supports a legislative intent to copy the operations of the PSC People\u2019s Counsel when creating the Division:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-6\">People\u2019s Insurance Counsel</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-7\">* <em>* </em>*</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-8\">The Office of People\u2019s Counsel (OPC) performs a similar function to the proposed People\u2019s Insurance Counsel. OPC evaluates all matters pending before the Public Service Commission (PSC) to determine if the interests of residential users of public utilities are affected. It appears before PSC, various federal agencies, and the courts on behalf of consumers in all matters or proceedings over which PSC has original jurisdiction and in other matters in which OPC deems its interests to be involved.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b391-9\">In <em>PSC v. MPC, </em>furthermore, we held that the inherent powers conferred by the Legislature upon the PSC People\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>Counsel gave it the ability to seek judicial review, <em>irrespective </em>of the lack of explicit language in a judicial review provision. 309 Md. at 10, 522 A.2d at 373. In that case, the PSC People\u2019s Counsel initiated an action in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City, challenging, as unconstitutional, certain regulations promulgated by the Commission that established the procedural context for terminating a residential customer\u2019s service. After the Circuit Court ruled that the provisions were unconstitutional because a pretermination hearing was not required, the PSC argued before this Court that the PSC People\u2019s Counsel did not have the ability to seek judicial review, because the Legislature did not explicitly-refer to the PSC People\u2019s Counsel in the section governing judicial review of rule promulgations,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-4\">(a) <em>In general. </em>\u2014 Notwithstanding \u00a7 10-120 of the State Government Article, the validity of a regulation of the Commission shall be challenged in accordance with \u00a7 10-125 of the State Government Article.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-5\">(b) <em>Time for judicial review. </em>\u2014 A party to a Commission proceeding, a person that has been granted intervention in a Commission proceeding, or a person that has been ordered to participate in a Commission proceeding that seeks to challenge a decision by the Commission to act by order rather than regulation shall seek judicial review of the Commission\u2019s decision within 30 days after the Commission issues a final order in that proceeding.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b392-6\">Section 3-201 of the Public Utilities Article, Maryland Code (1998, 2008 Repl. Vol.),<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> but the legislature did explicitly mention the PSC People\u2019s Counsel in the Section governing \u201cjudicial review of orders and decisions\u201d of the PSC:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-7\">(a) <em>In general. </em>\u2014 Except for the staff of the Commission, a party or person in interest, including the People\u2019s Counsel, that is dissatisfied by a final decision or order of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>Commission may seek judicial review of the decision or order as provided in this subtitle.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">Maryland Code (1998, 2008 Repl.

Vol.), Sections 2-204(a) &amp; 2-205(a)-(b) of the Public Utilities Article. In so doing, we regarded it as insignificant that one judicial review provision made explicit reference to the People\u2019s Counsel\u2019s ability to seek judicial review, whereas the other one did not, because the People\u2019s Counsel was generally charged with appearing-before courts and the Commission <em>on behalf of </em>residential utility consumers:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-6\">People\u2019s Counsel is charged with evaluating all matters pending before the Commission to determine if residential users of utility services are affected.

Moreover, People\u2019s Counsel is given the power to \u201cappear before the Commission and the courts <em>on behalf of those users\u201d </em>in all cases where People\u2019s Counsel deems the interests of residential users are involved. <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added). Furthermore, People\u2019s Counsel is granted all the rights of counsel for a party to the proceeding. <em>Id. </em>Therefore, People\u2019s Counsel has standing to bring suit under \u00a7 89 to protect the interests of residential utility customers.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b394-7\"><em>PSC v. MPC, </em>309 Md. at 10, 522 A.2d at 373 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b394-8\">What is dispositive in the present case is that the language establishing the powers of the Division is almost identical to that which we relied upon in <em>PSC v. MPC </em>to determine that the PSC People\u2019s Counsel could seek judicial review. The language, moreover, was adopted by the Legislature in 2004, well after our decision in <em>PSC v. MPC. </em>We often have acknowledged that when the Legislature acts, it does so <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>with knowledge of our decisions. <em>See Romm v.

Certainly, the parallel nature of the legislative enactments regarding the inherent powers of the PSC People\u2019s Counsel and the Division is strong support for our interpretation that the Division may seek judicial review. <em>See, e.g., State v.

Insley, </em>293 Md. 483, 491, 445 A.2d 689, 693 (1982) (finding parallel construction illustrative of legislative intent when interpreting the meaning of certain requirements under the Corporations and Associations Article).</p>\n<p id=\"b395-4\">Allstate posits, nevertheless, that the filing of its decision not to write insurance in the delineated areas did not create a \u201cmatter\u201d that was \u201cpending\u201d before the Commissioner, because Section 19-107 of the Insurance Article is a \u201cfile and use statute.\u201d The language in issue specifies: \u201c(1) The Division shall evaluate each ... insurance matter pending before the Commissioner to determine whether the interests of insurance consumers are afl'ected[;] (2) If the Division determines that the interests of insurance consumers are affected, the Division may appear before the Commissioner and courts on behalf of insurance consumers in each matter or proceeding over which the Commissioner has original jurisdiction.\u201d Section 6-306(a) of the State Government Article.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">Allstate argues that had the Commissioner <em>disapproved </em>of the filing, it could have requested a hearing, while the converse, Allstate argues, is not true. Allstate asserts that when the Insurance Commissioner took the position that Allstate could proceed with its \u201cnon-write\u201d filing, a matter was not created from which the Division could request a hearing. Essentially Allstate asserts that because Section 19-107 is a file and use statute, it was entitled to implement its \u201cnon-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>write\u201d within 60' days, and the Insurance Commissioner\u2019s \u201cposition\u201d was meaningless, unless it was one of disapproval.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-4\">We disagree with Allstate. While it is true that statutorily the Commissioner is not mandated to take a \u201cposition\u201d on a filing, it is also clear that the \u201cposition\u201d taken regarding Allstate\u2019s filing is not a nullity. Insurance companies in similar situations have used a \u201cposition\u201d of an insurance commissioner to defend against a policy provision\u2019s illegality. <em>See Watson v. United Services Automobile Ass\u2019n, </em>566 N.W.2d 683, 692 (Minn.1997) (\u201cUSAA additionally argues that its insurance policy must be valid because the Commissioner of Commerce approved it.... [A] provision in an insurance policy contrary to the Minnesota standard fire insurance policy cannot be permitted to stand even if the commissioner approved it. The commissioner is an administrative official with no power to alter the meaning and intention of the language of the legislature.\u201d). It is also obvious that were Allstate\u2019s decision not to write insurance in certain geographic areas challenged as discriminatory in federal court in the wake of <em>Dehoyos v. Allstate Corp., </em>345 F.3d 290 (5th Cir.2003), Allstate may choose to use the \u201cposition\u201d of the Insurance Commissioner as a defense. <em>See </em>William Goddard, <em>Swimming in the Wake of Dehoyos: When Federal Courts Sail into Disparate Impact Waters, Will State Regulation of Insurance Remain Above the Waves?, </em>10 Conn. Ins. L.J. 369, 395 (2003). Thus, the issuance of the e-mail on May 31, 2007, in which the Insurance Administration determined the proposed \u201cnon-write\u201d to be nondiscriminatory, among other things, did create a pending matter that affected insurance consumers and over which the Commissioner had original jurisdiction, giving the Division the ability to \u201cappear before the Commissioner ... on behalf of insurance consumers.... \u201d <em>See </em>Section 6-306(a)(2) of the State Government Article.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-6\">Allstate also argues that the creation of the Division in the Office of the Attorney General is conducive of the legislative intent that the Division should not have standing as a party before the Commission because the Attorney General\u2019s Office <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>would be representing both the Division and the Insurance Commissioner in any judicial review action. In support of this contention, Allstate cites two cases from other jurisdictions, <em>Att\u2019y Gen. v. Michigan Pub. Serv. Comm\u2019n, </em>243 Mich.App. 487, 625 N.W.2d 16, 33 (2000) and <em>City of York v. Penn. Pub. Util. Comm\u2019n, </em>449 Pa. 136, 295 A.2d 825, 831-33 (1972); both are instances in which a state agency named the respective state\u2019s attorney general\u2019s office as an adverse party. These cases are inapposite, however, because the Office of the Attorney General is not, in the present case, an adverse party.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-4\">We would note as well, Allstate has conceded in its brief, \u201cthat when the Attorney General appears in representative capacity, he or she may represent opposing state agencies in the same action.\u201d Our sister states, in the same situation, have emphasized the importance of the assurance of independent representation, when competing parties represented by the Attorney General are involved: \u201cA majority of states have permitted ... the AG to concurrently represent conflicting interests when the AG can ensure independent representation for the competing parties.\u201d <em>State v. Klattenhoff, </em>71 Haw. 598, 801 P.2d 548, 551 (1990), citing <em>Superintendent of Ins. v. Attorney Gen., </em>558 A.2d 1197, 1202-03 (Me.1989); <em>Connecticut Comm\u2019n on Special Revenue v. Connecticut Freedom of Information Comm\u2019n, </em>174 Conn. 308, 387 A.2d 533, 537 (1978); <em>Feeney v. Commonwealth, </em>373 Mass. 359, 366 N.E.2d 1262, 1266 (1977); <em>E.P.A. v. Pollution Control Bd., </em>69 Ill.2d 394, 14 Ill.Dec. 245, 372 N.E.2d 50 (1977); <em>Commonwealth ex rel. Hancock v. Paxton, </em>516 S.W.2d 865 (Ky.1974); <em>Humphrey ex rel. State v.

Snipes, </em>266 S.C. 415, 223 S.E.2d 853, 855-56 (1976). We are assured that the Division\u2019s representation by the Attorney General and the Commissioner\u2019s representation by the Attorney General does not create a conflict, especially when one is functioning as general counsel to a State agency and the other is not.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">In conclusion, then, we hold that the Division was a party to a matter pending before the Commissioner, when it requested <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>a hearing on Allstate\u2019s non-write, and that it has standing to seek judicial review.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE CITY REVERSED; CASE REMANDED TO THAT COURT FOR FURTHER PROCEEDINGS NOT INCONSISTENT WITH THIS OPINION; COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLEES.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b368-12\">.
