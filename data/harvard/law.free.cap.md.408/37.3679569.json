Vol. &amp; Supp.2008), and the Town of Washington Grove (\u201cTown\u201d), a municipal corporation located in Montgomery County. They joust here over the right to possess a parcel of real property adjacent to a boundary of the Town of Washington Grove. The MNCPPC posits its claim to the property on a purported \u201cLegacy Open Space\u201d (\u201cLOS\u201d) dedication from the current owner of the parcel, Toll MD II, LLC (\u201cToll\u201d), as part of Toll\u2019s subdivision development proposal for a tract of which the parcel is a part. The Town proposes to acquire the property by condemnation.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-5\">Lurking within this dispute is the issue, among others, of the Town\u2019s authority to condemn property lying outside its municipal boundary; however, that question will have to wait to receive our attention, if at all, for another day. For reasons to be explained, we shall reverse the judgment of the Circuit Court for Montgomery County with respect to its denial of the MNCPPC\u2019s motion to intervene as of right in the condemnation action initiated by the Town against Toll, and remand the case to the Circuit Court for further proceedings not inconsistent with this Opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-6\">I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b72-7\">On 14 September 2001, Toll, by its predecessor-in-interest, Oxbridge Development at Washington Grove, L.C., filed an application with the Montgomery County Planning Board (\u201cPlanning Board\u201d) of the MNCPPC seeking approval of a preliminary plan of subdivision for a 66.59 acre tract of residentially-zoned land located in Montgomery County. The application was designated as Preliminary Plan No. 1-02022. The proposed development was named the \u201cCasey Property at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>Mill Creek.\u201d On 11 July 2005, the Planning Board approved Preliminary Plan No. 1-02022, with conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-4\">A part of the 66.59 acres is a parcel, approximately 12 acres in size, which lies \u201cadjacent to, and outside of, the corporate limits\u201d of the Town. The Planning Board\u2019s approval of the subdivision plan refers to this parcel as the \u201cLOS Parcel.\u201d The LOS Parcel is an \u201copen field\u201d or \u201cmeadow\u201d which, in the Planning Board approval of Preliminary Plan No. 1-02022, was determined \u201cto provide a valuable buffer to the significant heritage resource that is the Town of Washington Grove.\u201d The LOS Parcel is addressed by the Montgomery County Legacy Open Space Functional Master Plan,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and was listed, in Toll\u2019s subdivision plan, as a Class II Heritage Resource. According to the Planning Board\u2019s approval, \u201c[t]he meadow enhances the setting of the Town, designated a National Register historic site, by maintaining the [Tjown\u2019s rural character.\u201d The approval described the LOS Parcel as significant according to several Legacy Open Space criteria, including:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b73-5\">(a) The property has countywide and national significance in terms of its association with the Town of Washington Grove, a heritage resource of national import with exceptional architectural character and rural viewscapes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b73-6\">(b) Because of its association with Washington Grove, the site contributes to the Legacy program\u2019s heritage theme of the Rail Community Cluster, of which the Town is a part.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b73-7\">(c) If preserved as open space, the site would serve as a protective buffer of the significant heritage resource that is Washington Grove. Over 57% of the Town is preserved as forest today, and the preservation of this open field would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>preserve a rural viewscape on the last remaining unprotected side of the Town.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b74-4\">The 11 July 2005 Planning Board approval acknowledges that approximately four years of negotiations had taken place, in particular between Toll and the Town, to preserve the LOS Parcel \u201cas parkland\u201d to \u201censure[ ] compatibility between the Town and the new development\u201d and \u201cenhance[ ] the preservation of the rural character of Ridge Road.\u201d In particular, the approval cites the testimony of the Town\u2019s Mayor, who participated in public hearings in December 2004 held by the Planning Board regarding the subdivision plan proposal, proclaiming that the Town\u2019s \u201coverriding concern was to ensure the protection of the 13-acre Legacy Open Space parcel to provide a buffer between the new project and the existing Town communities.\u201d The Board also heard the testimony of members of preservation organizations and Town residents who collectively voiced the view that the \u201cmeadow was critical to the long-term protection of the Town as a historic resource.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b74-5\">In its approval of the subdivision plan, the Planning Board<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> included 28 \u201cConditions of Approval.\u201d Of particular relevance to the case at hand is Condition 15, which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b74-6\">Within the earlier of 24 months of the issuance of the [approval] for Preliminary Plan 1-02022 or the recordation of the initial plat of Phase I, Applicant to dedicate to [the MNCPPC] the area shown on the plan as \u201cLegacy Open Space Natural Area\u201d totaling approximately 12 acres.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b74-7\">Thus, Toll was required to dedicate the LOS Parcel in order to obtain approval and recordation of the initial final plat of subdivision for development of the 66.59 acre project, if Toll wished to pursue development pursuant to Preliminary Plan <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>No. 1-02022. <em>See </em>Md.Code, Art 28 \u00a7 7-107 (1957, 2003 RepLVol. &amp; Supp.2008); Montgomery County Code (\u201cCounty Code\u201d), Ch. 50 (\u201cSubdivision of Land\u201d) (2008).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b76-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>The Planning Board mailed notice of the 11 July 2005 subdivision approval to parties of record who appeared and participated in its proceedings. The parties of record included the Town and the applicant/developer of the development at the time, an entity known as \u201cOxbridge Development at Washington Grove, L.C.\u201d '<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Neither the Town nor any other party of record elected to pursue judicial review of the Plan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>ning Board\u2019s action.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b77-4\">On 6 September 2005, the Town Council of Washington Grove adopted its Resolution No. 2005-06 authorizing the institution by the Town of an eminent domain action in the Circuit Court to acquire the LOS Parcel. The Resolution explains that the Town\u2019s interest in acquiring the LOS Parcel by means of condemnation was due to the fact that members of the County Council had pressured the Planning Board to delay approving Preliminary Plan No. 1-02022, and in particular the dedication of the LOS Parcel, because the County Council was considering using the LOS Parcel as the site of a public school. The Resolution states the Town Council\u2019s belief that instituting the condemnation action was necessary to ensure that \u201cthe LOS remains a public park and recreational resource in a natural state and also continues to afford protection to the historic character of the Town into the future as intended by the Planning Board\u201d when it approved Preliminary Plan No. 1-02022. The Town Council believed that \u201cthe surest means to achieve [its] goals is [for] ownership and maintenance of the LOS [Parcel] be vested in the Town.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b77-5\">On 2 December 2005, the Town filed a complaint in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County asserting its power of eminent domain to acquire the LOS Parcel. Oxbridge Development at Washington Grove, L.C. was named as the sole defendant in the action as the fee simple owner of the LOS <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>Parcel.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Toll<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> filed an answer to the complaint on 11 January 2006. On 9 February 2006, Toll filed in the condemnation case a \u201cThird Party Complaint for Declaratory Judgment\u201d naming the MNCPPC as a third-party defendant. As part of the relief sought by Toll in the third-party complaint, the Circuit Court was asked to \u201cdeclare and determine, to the extent the condemnation requested by Washington Grove is granted, that such condemnation fulfills the condition in the Preliminary Plan requiring the dedication of the [LOS Parcel] to [the MNCPPC].\u201d Toll\u2019s interest was to ensure that the MNCPPC would be bound in its capacity as the approver of the subdivision plan if the Town was successful in condemning the LOS Parcel; in other words, Toll sought to avoid a situation in which the Town acquired the parcel thereby, making it impossible for Toll to comply -with the 11 July 2005 subdivision approval, in particular Condition 15, and preventing Toll from moving forward with the development based on Preliminary Plan No. 1-02022.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-4\">On 30 March 2006, the MNCPPC filed an answer to Toll\u2019s third-party complaint. Thereafter, it participated broadly and actively in the proceedings in the Circuit Court, filing a designation of experts; an answer to the Town\u2019s 23 August 2006 amended complaint on 15 September 2006;<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> a motion to realign parties,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> stay proceedings and stay amended schedul<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>ing; a motion to separate a legal question for decision by court; and, motions and supplemental memoranda in support of summary judgment (discussed infra).</p>\n<p id=\"b79-4\">Concurrently, while the litigation was in full flight, Toll continued to work toward approval of a final plat of subdivision for the initial phase of the development. On 19 April 2007, Toll sought to comply effectively with Condition 15 in the preliminary plan approval by \u201cconveying\u201d the LOS Parcel to the MNCPPC in a \u201cDeed of Dedication.\u201d The Deed provides, in part, that the LOS Parcel \u201cshall be used and maintained, in perpetuity, as a Legacy Open Space Natural Area (\u2018LOS Area\u2019) in accordance with applicable criteria of Montgomery County, Maryland and for no other purpose.\u201d The MNCPPC claims that one of the incidental reasons it accepted delivery of Toll\u2019s Deed of Dedication was \u201cto resolve the unfair consequence of placing Toll in an uncertain, no-win situation caused by the legal contest between the Town and Commission over condemnation of the LOS.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b79-5\">The Deed, however, contained a conditional \u201cunwind\u201d provision. That provision provides,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b79-6\">4. Unwind of Dedication</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b79-7\">(a) Termination of Dedication. The Commission acknowledges that Toll is dedicating the LOS Parcel for the purpose of resolving the Taking Action, including the Third Party Claim, and in reliance upon its expectation that the final site plan and final plat of subdivision for Phase I will be finally approved in substantial accordance with the Preliminary Plan without undue delay. The Commission further acknowledges that there will be no justification or consideration for such dedication if these approvals are not obtained by Toll. Therefore, if the Preliminary Plan expires or otherwise terminates for any reason and, at the time of such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>expiration or termination, a final site plan and final plat of Subdivision for all of Phase I (as Phase I is described in the Opinion) have not been finally approved in substantial accordance with the Preliminary Plan, the dedication of the [LOS Parcel] effected by the Dedication Deed shall automatically terminate and be of no further force or effect and the Commission shall immediately reconvey to Toll, for no consideration, all rights, title, estate, and interest of the Commission and the public in and to the [LOS Parcel]. Title to the [LOS Parcel] as of the time of reconveyance shall be free and clear of all liens and encumbrances other than those (if any) which affected the [LOS Parcel] immediately prior to the dedication of such parcel by Toll. Furthermore, if the site plan for all of Phase I has not been finally approved in substantial accordance with the Preliminary Plan on or before September 80, 2007, Toll reserves the right to require the termination of the dedication and the reconveyance of the [LOS Parcel] in the same manner as if the Preliminary Plan had expired or otherwise terminated without final approval of the site plan and plat for Phase I. Toll shall exercise this right, if at all, by written notice given to the Commission after September 30, 2007 and before final approval of the Phase I site plan. If Toll gives such notice to the Commission, the termination of the dedication shall occur immediately and the reconveyance of the [LOS Parcel] shall occur within ten (10) days after the next meeting of the Commission which follows the Commission\u2019s receipt of such notice.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b80-4\">Thus, the dedication by Toll was conditioned on approval of the site plan for Phase I and final plat of subdivision not only in accordance with the Montgomery County site development ordinances and the general zoning code, but also in \u201csubstantial accordance with [Preliminary Plan No. 1-02022].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b80-5\">Prior to Toll\u2019s delivery of the Deed of Dedication to the MNCPPC, the Town and the MNCPPC, on 29 and 31 January 2007, respectively, filed their first motions for summary judgment in the Town\u2019s condemnation action. Several subsequent motions and memoranda in support of summary judgment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>were submitted by the three participants. On 24 April 2007, the Circuit Court held a hearing on the motions for summary judgment. The MNCPPC argued that, even prior to receiving the Deed of Dedication from Toll, it had a legal interest in the LOS Parcel as a result of the conditions imposed in the 11 July 2005 approval of the preliminary plan of subdivision. The MNCPPC also argued that the Town, as a municipality, lacked authority to condemn the LOS Parcel because the MNCPPC has preemptive statutory jurisdiction to acquire, by condemnation or otherwise, property within the boundaries of both the Regional and Metropolitan Districts. Due to this overriding regulatory authority, it was pressed, the Town was without legal authority to condemn the LOS Parcel without first obtaining the MNCPPC\u2019s approval. Further, the MNCPPC argued that the Town lacked statutory authority to condemn or otherwise extinguish the MNCPPC\u2019s interest in the LOS Parcel because of the MNCPPC\u2019s status as an agency of the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-4\">The Town rejoined that the Deed of Dedication did not grant the MNCPPC a legally cognizable ownership interest in the LOS Parcel because the Deed contains the \u201cunwind\u201d provision. The Town argued that the doctrine of <em>Lis pendens </em>forecloses the MNCPPC\u2019s ability to take a legal interest in the LOS Parcel because the condemnation action was filed before the Deed of Dedication was delivered by Toll. Further, the Town relied on its claimed power to condemn property \u201cneeded for any public purpose\u201d under \u00a7 2(b)(24) of Article 23A of the Maryland Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\">On 6 September 2007, the Circuit Court issued an Opinion and Order granting partial summary judgment to the Town, and denying summary judgment to Toll and the MNCPPC. The Circuit Court concluded, after reviewing Md.Code, Article 23A \u00a7 7A and Article 25 \u00a7 224(a), and expanding upon its interpretation of our holding in <em>Birge v. Town of Easton, </em>274 Md. 635, 337 A.2d 435 (1975), that \u201cstatutory authority and case law support a municipal corporation\u2019s ability to condemn property beyond the municipal corporation\u2019s corporate limits.\u201d The Circuit Court held that nothing in Md.Code, Article 23A, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>nor Article 28 would prohibit, conflict with, or impliedly proscribe the Town from condemning the LOS Parcel. Further, the Circuit Court found that the Town\u2019s condemnation of the LOS Parcel satisfies sufficiently the \u201cpublic purpose\u201d requirement of Article 23A \u00a7 2(b)(24).</p>\n<p id=\"b82-4\">The Opinion and Order, however, failed to address how the Circuit Court viewed the MNCPPC as a party with regard to all remaining aspects of the litigation, and whether it would be permitted to participate in asserting its interests in the LOS Parcel. In order to clarify this point, on 5 October 2007, the MNCPPC filed a Motion to Intervene as a Party-Defendant in the Town\u2019s condemnation action, a Motion to Stay, and a Motion for Clarification and Reconsideration. The Town opposed in writing the Motion to Intervene on 24 October 2007, arguing that the motion was untimely and that the doctrine of <em>lis pendens </em>barred the MNCPPC\u2019s participation in the condemnation proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-5\">By Order dated 4 December 2007, and entered 5 December 2007, the Circuit Court denied, without a hearing or elaboration of reasons, the Motion to Intervene, Motion to Stay, and Motion for Clarification and Reconsideration, and granted the Town\u2019s Motion to Dismiss Toll\u2019s Third-Party Complaint. On 2 January 2008, the MNCPPC filed a notice of appeal to the Court of Special Appeals and sought review of the denial of its motion to intervene. We issued a writ of certiorari, upon the Town\u2019s petition and the MNCPPC\u2019s cross-petition,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> before the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>intermediate appellate court considered the case. <em>Park &amp; Planning v. Wash. Grove, </em>405 Md. 348, 952 A.2d 224 (Table) (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b83-4\">The successful petitions for certiorari pose, for the purposes of this appeal, three main issues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b83-5\">1. Whether the Circuit Court erred in denying the MNCPPC\u2019s motion to intervene under Md. Rule 2-214?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b83-6\">2. Whether the doctrine of <em>Us pendens </em>applies to the Town\u2019s condemnation action?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b83-7\">3. If the doctrine of <em>Us pendens </em>does apply to the Town\u2019s condemnation action, what substantive effect, if any, does that doctrine have on the MNCPPC\u2019s ability to intervene under Md. Rule 2-214?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b83-8\">II. LEGAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b83-9\">Because there are three governmental entities with potentially overlapping authority as regards the LOS Parcel at the heart of this dispute, the MNCPPC, the Town, and Montgomery County, Maryland (through the County\u2019s Subdivision Regulations), we pause to outline briefly the legal bases upon which these governmental entities may have sway over the subject property.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-10\">A. The MNCPPC</p>\n<p id=\"b83-11\">The MNCPPC is an agency of the State of Maryland. Md.Code, Ait. 28 \u00a7 1-101.

That is the main \u201cplanning\u201d function.

Section 50-3 provides that the Chapter \u201cshall apply to all land within the county which lies within the Maryland-Washington Regional District, as now defined by Article 28 of the Annotated Code of Maryland.\u201d County Code, \u00a7 50-3. Under Chapter 50 of the County Code, the subdivision of land, essentially, is a two step procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>The first step is the subdivision<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> plan<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> application process under which the proposed subdivision of land may be approved or approved subject to certain conditions. An applicant who desires to subdivide land must submit to the Montgomery County Planning Board an application, a proposed preliminary subdivision plan which consists of a tracing drawing, and a filing fee.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> County Code, \u00a7 50-34. Pursuant to \u00a7 50-35(f), the Planning Board must either approve, approve with conditions, or disapprove the preliminary plan. An approved preliminary plan has a \u201cValidity Period\u201d during which the approved plan must be implemented or its validity will expire. County Code, \u00a7 50 \u2014 35(h); <em>see </em>n.3, <em>supra. </em>At any time before recordation of a final plat of subdivision, an applicant (in its discretion) may abandon the subdivision application (if not acted upon yet by the Planning Board) or an approved preliminary plan (by simply allowing its validity to expire or by submitting a superseding plan application). There is no provision in Chapter 50 that precludes an applicant from filing an entirely new subdivision plan for the same land at any time, and there is no provision authorizing the Planning Board or any other government agency to compel an unwilling applicant to complete the final plat approval and recordation process in accordance with an approved subdivi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>sion plan.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b92-4\">After a preliminary plan of subdivision is approved, the concluding step in perfecting that approval is to obtain Planning Board approval of a final plat<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> for the subdivision.

DISCUSSION A.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-6\">Md. Rule 2-214 governs intervention in litigation in the Maryland courts. This Rule provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>(a) Of Right. Upon timely motion, a person shall be permitted to intervene in an action: (1) when the person has an unconditional right to intervene as a matter of law; or (2) when the person claims an interest relating to the property or transaction that is the subject of the action, and the person is so situated that the disposition of the action may as a practical matter impair or impede the ability to protect that interest unless it is adequately represented by existing parties.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-4\">(b) Permissive. (1) Generally. Upon timely motion a person may be permitted to intervene in an action when the person\u2019s claim or defense has a question of law or fact in common with the action.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-5\">(2) Governmental interest. Upon timely motion the federal government, the State, a political subdivision of the State, or any officer or agency of any of them may be permitted to intervene in an action when the validity of a constitutional provision, charter provision, statute, ordinance, regulation, executive order, requirement, or agreement affecting the moving party is drawn in question in the action, or when a party to an action relies for ground of claim or defense on such constitutional provision, charter provision, statute, ordinance, regulation, executive order, requirement, or agreement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-6\">(3) Considerations. In exercising its discretion the court shall consider whether the intervention will unduly delay or prejudice the adjudication of the rights of the original parties.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-7\">* * =i=</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b93-8\">Md. Rule 2-214. We have held \u201c[t]hat the denial of a claim to intervene, both as a matter of right [and permissively] under [the predecessor to Md. Rule 2-214] ..., becomes immediately appealable is no longer open to question.\u201d <em>Md. Radiological Soc\u2019y, Inc. v. Health Servs. Cost Rev. Comm\u2019n, </em>285 Md. 383, 388 n. 4, 402 A.2d 907, 910 n. 4 (1979). \u201cThat the State has a right to appeal from a denial of a motion to intervene is no longer open to doubt.\u201d <em>Md.-Nat\u2019l Capital Park &amp; Planning </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number><em>Comm\u2019n v.

Ian Corp., </em>282 Md. 459, 385 A.2d 80 (1978), Md. Rule 208 governing intervention in the circuit courts (the predecessor to current Md. Rule 2-214) was derived from Fed.R.Civ.P. 24 as it formerly appeared. <em>Ian Corp., </em>282 Md. at 463, 385 A.2d at 82. In <em>Ian Corp., </em>we adopted the test explained by the Supreme Court in <em>NAACP v. New York, </em>413 U.S. 345, 93 S.Ct. 2591, 37 L.Ed.2d 648 (1973), as the proper one for appellate review of a denial of an asserted right- to intervene, as well as to determine whether a motion to intervene has been filed timely. <em>Ian Corp., </em>282 Md. at 465, 385 A.2d at 83.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-5\">A close reading of <em>NAACP v. New York, </em>however, reveals that the Supreme Court there provided only a standard of review for denials of motions to intervene based on untimeliness \u2014 whether an abuse of discretion occurred. The Court acknowledged explicitly that an abuse of discretion standard was not being applied to any of the other standards for determining intervention, whether asserted to be of right or permissive. <em>See NAACP v. New York, </em>413 U.S. at 369, 93 S.Ct. 2591 (\u201cWe therefore conclude that the motion to intervene was untimely and that the District Court did not abuse its discretion in denying the appellants\u2019 motion.... This makes it unnecessary for us to consider whether other conditions for intervention under [Fed.R.Civ.P. 24] were satisfied.\u201d). Thus, although we seemingly announced in <em>Ian Corp. </em>our adoption of an abuse of discretion standard for appellate review of a denial of an asserted right to intervene, a close reading of <em>NAACP v. New York </em>informs us that the question of the proper standard of review for a ruling on a motion to intervene implicating any ground except timeliness remained an open question in Maryland.'</p>\n<p id=\"b94-6\">Subsequent federal authority decided under Fed. R.Civ.P. 24 fills the gap. The majority of those authorities <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>determined that the denial of a motion to intervene premised on a matter of right on any of the other permissible grounds is reviewed non-deferentially for legal correctness. <em>Fox v.

If the motion to intervene was denied by a trial judge due to a finding of untimeliness, however, the authorities remain consistent in the view that the proper standard of review is abuse of discretion, provided the trial court articulates reasons why the motion was untimely. <em>Effjohn Int'l Cruise Holdings, Inc. v. A &amp; L Sales, Inc., </em>346 F.3d 552, 558-59 (5th Cir.2003) (citing <em>John Doe No. 1 v. Glickman, </em>256 F.3d 371, 377 (5th Cir.2001)). A denial of permissive intervention, however, has been found to be subject to review only for abuse of discretion. <em>Fox, </em>519 F.3d at 1301 (citing <em>Worlds v. Dep\u2019t of Health &amp; Rehabilitative Servs., </em>929 F.2d 591, 595 (11th Cir.1991) (per curiam)).

Timeliness depends upon the individual circumstances in each case, and, as we have indicated here, consideration of those circumstances rests initially with the sound discretion of the trial court, which, unless abused, will not be disturbed on appellate review. <em>Coalition for Open Doors v. Annapolis Lodge No. 622, Benevolent &amp; Protective Order of Elks, </em>333 Md. 359, 367-68, 635 A.2d 412, 416 (1994) (quoting <em>Md. Radiological Soc\u2019y, </em>285 Md. at 388, 402 A.2d at 910). In the case <em>sub judice, </em>such circumstances include that the MNCPPC\u2019s motion was filed after the partial summary judgment in favor of the Town was entered by the Circuit Court. That judgment resolved as a matter of law the Town\u2019s legal authority to condemn the LOS Parcel, enabling the Town to move forward with the trial (valuation) phase of the condemnation action, which was to proceed against Toll as the sole defendant in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-8\">In <em>Coalition for Open Doors, </em>we observed that the filing of a motion to intervene, even after a judgment (partial or final) has been entered by a circuit court, under the proper circum<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>stances, may satisfy nonetheless the timeliness requirement. In that case we stated,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aj3\">Neither the federal cases (including the cases cited by the Annapolis Lodge) nor the decisions of this Court set forth any special standard or requirement, such as that urged by the Annapolis Lodge, for intervention after the trial court\u2019s decision. Rather, under circumstances like those in the present case, where the losing party declines to appeal, courts generally permit an applicant to intervene for the purpose of appeal where the applicant has standing and where the applicant acts promptly after the trial court\u2019s decision. <em>See, e.g., United Airlines, Inc. v.

Under the circumstances <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>the circuit court was fully warranted in permitting intervention.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b102-4\"><em>Coalition for Open Doors, </em>333 Md. at 368-71, 635 A.2d at 416-17.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">Applying the factors outlined in <em>Pharmaceia Eni Diagnostics </em>to the case at hand, in light of our holdings in <em>Coalition for Open Doors, </em>we conclude that the Circuit Court\u2019s denial of the MNCPPC\u2019s motion to intervene, to the extent it was predicated on untimeliness, amounted to an abuse of discretion. The MNCPPC commenced its participation in the proceedings in the Circuit Court with the filing of its 30 March 2006 answer to Toll\u2019s third-party complaint. Thereafter, it participated broadly and actively in the proceedings, including filing numerous motions and arguing before the Circuit Court as if a party in opposition to the Town\u2019s condemnation initiative for all purposes. The MNCPPC\u2019s participation included: filing on 22 September 2006 an answer to the Town\u2019s amended complaint; filing on 15 November 2006 a motion to realign parties, stay proceedings, and stay amended scheduling (and participating in oral argument thereon on 28 February 2007); filing on 31 January 2007 a motion to separate a legal question for decision by the court<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> and first motion for summary judgment; filing on 20 April 2007 and 18 May 2007 memoranda in support of its first motion for summary judgment; filing on 18 May 2007 a motion in opposition to the Town\u2019s motion for partial summary judgment; participating in oral argument on the summary judgment motions on 24 April 2007; and filing on 5 October 2007 motions for intervention, stay, and clarification and reconsideration. The obvious intent of the MNCPPC throughout this substantial participation in the Circuit Court was to oppose directly the Town\u2019s attempt to condemn the LOS Parcel on the basis that it was an unlawful conflict with the MNCPPC\u2019s exercise of its planning and park functions in the Regional and Metropolitan Districts. Until the motion to intervene, filed admittedly rather late in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>going, the Town and the Circuit Court seemed unconcerned that the MNCPPC had been participating as if it were a full party in the condemnation case. No hue or cry was raised until the opposition to the motion to intervene was advanced late in the going. Thus, until the sole remaining issue left to be tried in the action was how much the Town will pay for the LOS Parcel, everyone treated the MNCPPC as a party.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-4\">The MNCPPC\u2019s opposition to the Town\u2019s condemnation attempt is based on the Planning Board\u2019s approval requiring Toll to dedicate the LOS Parcel to the MNCPPC in order for Toll to be able to carry out its development plan pursuant to Preliminary Plan of Subdivision No. 1-02022. The approval was issued on 11 July 2005 and was not challenged by any party to the administrative proceedings, including the Town, and, importantly, the approval and condition as to the LOS Parcel was the product of some four years of negotiations between the Town, the MNCPPC, and the property owner over the fate of the LOS Parcel relative to the development plans for the entire tract. This action predated the 2 December 2005 condemnation action initiated by the Town. In the midst of the condemnation proceedings in the Circuit Court, on 19 April 2007, Toll purportedly performed under Condition 15 of the subdivision approval, albeit subject to the \u201cunwind\u201d provision, by \u201cconveying\u201d to the MNCPPC the LOS Parcel in a \u201cDeed of Dedication.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">Under the factors set forth in <em>PhamiaeeAa Eni Diagnostics, </em>in light of the procedural posture of this case, it is clear that the MNCPPC participated actively in the proceedings in the Circuit Court in an attempt to protect the perceived property interest that Toll was expected to convey to it; the MNCPPC\u2019s perceived interest became all the more relevant after Toll\u2019s attempt to convey the LOS Parcel to the MNCPPC in the 19 April 2007 \u201cDeed of Dedication\u201d. At the very least, upon the issuance of the approval by the Planning Board, the MNCPPC had some reasonable expectation that Toll would perform under the conditions of that approval, including the required dedication, even though, as noted earlier here, at any point Toll could have abandoned the approved <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>plan and allowed the conditions to expire. That the disposition of the LOS Parcel as provided for in the condition of the approved plan was the product of four years of negotiation, including participation by the Town, however, suggests that Toll intended to follow through with the approved plan and dedicate the LOS Parcel to the MNCPPC as part of developing its property pursuant to the approved plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-4\">Although the MNCPPC was impleaded by Toll and participated substantially in the proceedings in the Circuit Court, the trial judge held, in denying the MNCPPC\u2019s summary judgment motion, that due to the \u201cunwind\u201d provision in the Deed of Dedication, the dedication from Toll was contingent at best, and, therefore, the MNCPPC \u201cis not the owner of the [LOS Parcel] and as such has no role in the condemnation of the property by the Town.\u201d The trial court\u2019s holding notwithstanding, the MNCPPC had a clear and discernable interest, under at least the Deed, to intervene in the condemnation action to protect its interest, however it may be characterized, in the LOS Parcel. The MNCPPC filed its motion to intervene on 5 October 2007, soon after the Circuit Court\u2019s summary judgment rulings and, upon the denial of the motion on 5 December 2007, the MNCPPC filed timely a notice of appeal to the Court of Special Appeals. <em>See </em>Md. Rule 8-202(a) (\u201cExcept as otherwise provided in this Rule or by law, the notice of appeal shall be filed within 30 days after entry of the judgment or order from which the appeal is taken.\u201d). The MNCPPC and the Town litigated at length on the merits on the condemnation and dedication issues before the Circuit Court, thereby removing any reasonable apprehension of prejudice to any existing parties or undue delay in the progression of the proceedings. Therefore, we conclude that the denial of the MNCPPC\u2019s motion to intervene, to the extent based on untimeliness, was an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-5\">2.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-6\">a.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-7\">As stated in <em>Citizens Coordinating Committee on Friendship Heights, Inc. v. TKU Associates, </em>276 Md. 705, 351 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>A.2d 133 (1976), \u201c[t]he requirement which we have imposed on the applicant for intervention ... is that he have an interest for the protection of which intervention is essential and which is not otherwise protected.\u201d <em>Citizens Coordinating Comm., </em>276 Md. at 712, 351 A.2d at 138 (citing <em>Shenk v. Md. Dist. Sav. &amp; Loan Co., </em>235 Md. 326, 327, 201 A.2d 498, 499 (1964)). Put another way, \u201cwhether the applicant for intervention has an interest which it is essential to protect may be equated with the requirement . .. that he \u2018is or may be bound by a judgment in the action.\u2019 \u201d <em>Citizens Coordinating Comm., </em>276 Md. at 712, 351 A.2d at 138. It is not enough for a person seeking intervention to base its motion on concern that some future action in the proceedings may affect its interests adversely. Seeking intervention on such a basis is \u201cmerely speculative and affords no present basis upon which to become a party to the proceedings.\u201d <em>Shenk, </em>235 Md. at 327, 201 A.2d at 499.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-4\">The Town argues that the MNCPPC cannot satisfy this requirement because the nature of its interest in the LOS Parcel received from Toll in the Deed of Dedication is insufficient to demonstrate that the MNCPPC \u201cmay be bound by a judgment in the [condemnation] action.\u201d The Town argues that, under Maryland law, a public dedication gives no more than an easement interest to the recipient. <em>See Md.-Nat\u2019l Capital Park &amp; Planning Comm\u2019n v. McCaw, </em>246 Md. 662, 675, 229 A.2d 584, 591 (1967) (\u201cWhen a parcel of land is dedicated as a street or for other public use, the owner of the land retains his fee simple interest, subject to an easement for the public.\u201d); <em>Toney Sehloss Props.

Therefore, the Town posits, the MNCPPC acquired only an easement for public use as a result of the dedication from Toll, an insufficient interest to bind the MNCPPC under any decision by the Circuit Court in the condemnation action regarding the LOS Parcel, because Toll remains as \u201cthe owner of the land re-tainting] his fee simple interest.\u201d <em>McCaw, </em>246 Md. at 675, 229 A.2d at 591.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-4\">The MNCPPC responds that the nature of the interest it acquired in the Deed of Dedication from Toll, even if only an easement for public use, supports the notion that a judgment of condemnation in the Town\u2019s favor regarding the LOS Parcel will bind the MNCPPC. Several of our cases support this position, including <em>De Lauder v. County Comm\u2019rs, </em>94 Md. 1, 50 A. 427 (1901), where the Court found:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b106-5\">Property has been defined as \u201cthe dominion, or indefinite right of user and disposition which one may lawfully exercise over particular things or subjects.\u201d 19 <em>Amer. &amp; Eng. Ency. of Law, </em>284. It extends to easements and other incorporeal hereditaments, which, though without tangible or physical existence, may become the subject of private ownership. <em>Tripp v. Overocker, </em>7 Colo. 74 <em>[Trippe v. Overocker, </em>7 Colo. 72, 1 P. 695]. Here the land over which the right of way was enjoyed was not the property of Mrs. DeLauder. The right to use this land, within certain prescribed limits, was the only property right she had in the land, and it is this right of user which is alleged to have been taken by the defendants. The plea does not deny the averments of the declaration, but is admittedly a plea in confession and avoidance.... The injury inflicted upon Mrs. DeLauder is not the rendering, the use of her right of way inconvenient or expensive, but it is the destruction of its use, and its destruction is a <em>taking </em>in as just a sense as the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>appropriation of a gravel bank for the repair of a public road would be a taking.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b107-5\"><em>De Lauder, </em>94 Md. at 6-8, 50 A. at 428-29 (citations omitted) (emphasis in original). The MNCPPC also relies on <em>Mercantile-Safe Deposit &amp; Trust Co. v. Mayor of Balt, </em>308 Md. 627, 521 A.2d 734 (1987), where the Court observed that <em>\u201cDe Lauder </em>held that an easement for ingress and egress is compensable property. So is a scenic easement, <em>Hardesty v. State Roads Com\u2019n, </em>276 Md. 25, 343 A.2d 884 (1975), and a leasehold interest, <em>Veirs v. State Roads Comm., </em>217 Md. 545, 143 A.2d 613 (1958).\u201d <em>Mercantile-Safe Deposit &amp; Trust Co., </em>308 Md. at 640, 521 A.2d at 740. The <em>Mercantile </em>Court expanded upon <em>De Lauder </em>by holding that \u201ca covenant running with the land ordinarily is a compensable property interest in the condemnation context, at least to the extent it adds measurable value to the land to which it is attached.\u201d <em>Mercantile-Safe Deposit &amp; Trust Co., </em>308 Md. at 641, 521 A.2d at 741. Further, in <em>Electro-Nucleonics, Inc. v. Wash. Suburban Sanitary Comm\u2019n, </em>315 Md. 361, 554 A.2d 804 (1989), we quoted approvingly \u00a7 566 of the Restatement of Property, which provides that \u201c[ulpon a condemnation of land subject to the obligation of a promise respecting its use in such manner as to extinguish the interest in the land created by the promise, compensation must be made to those entitled to the benefit of the promise.\u201d <em>Electro-Nucleonics, Inc., </em>315 Md. at 375, 554 A.2d at 811 (quoting Restatement Of Property \u00a7 566 (1944)).</p>\n<p id=\"b107-6\">The MNCPPC also relies on the language of Md.Code, Art. 28 \u00a7 5-101, in conjunction with Art. 28 \u00a7 5-107, as supporting a distinction between donations for public use made to the MNCPPC (as in the present case), versus other dedications such as those addressed in <em>McCaw,</em><footnotemark><em>23</em></footnotemark><em> </em>with the former granting the MNCPPC ownership of the property so dedicated. Md.

Art. 28, \u00a7 5-107 provides</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-5\">Lands acquired under this article, title to which shall become vested in the State of Maryland or the Maryland-National Capital Park and Planning Commission, shall be held by the State or the Commission for the general benefit of the citizens of the State of Maryland and especially for the benefit of the citizens and residents of Montgomery and Prince George\u2019s Counties within the metropolitan district. Title to the lands may not be conveyed by the State, nor may such use be extinguished without the approval by resolution of the Commission.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b108-6\">Md.Code, Art. 28 \u00a7 5-107. Thus, the MNCPPC argues that the Deed of Dedication conveyed to it Toll\u2019s interest in the LOS Parcel, to which the MNCPPC holds title under \u00a7 \u00a7 5\u2014 101 and 5-107 on behalf of the citizens of the State of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>Maryland, and that the MNCPPC should be entitled to protect that interest by intervening in the Town\u2019s condemnation action against Toll.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-4\">Unmoved, the Town argues in rebuttal that Art. 28 \u00a7 5-101 provides three means by which the MNCPPC may \u201cacquire\u201d property, to include \u201cby means of donations, purchases, or condemnation.\u201d Md.Code, Art. 28 \u00a7 5-101. In the present case, the Town deems the transfer of interest, if any, that occurred by means of the Deed of Dedication to be merely a dedication, which under <em>McCaw, </em>246 Md. at 675, 229 A.2d at 591, grants the MNCPPC only an easement for public use, and absolutely no ownership interest, with Toll retaining title in fee simple to the LOS Parcel. <em>See McCaw, </em>246 Md. at 675, 229 A.2d at 591 (\u201cWhen a parcel of land is dedicated as a street or for other public use, the owner of the land retains his fee simple interest, subject to an easement for the public.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">Second, the Town proclaims that Toll, in fact, has not conveyed the LOS Parcel to the MNCPPC because of the \u201cunwind\u201d provision contained within the Deed of Dedication. As noted, <em>supra, </em>the \u201cUnwind of Dedication\u201d clause of the Deed of Dedication provides that the dedication will be terminated automatically if \u201cthe Preliminary Plan expires or otherwise terminates for any reason and, at the time of such expiration or termination, a final site plan and final plat of subdivision of all of Phase I ... have not been finally approved in substantial accordance with the Preliminary Plan.\u201d The clause further reserves to Toll the right to terminate the dedication \u201cif the site plan for all of Phase I has not been finally approved in substantial accordance with the Preliminary Plan on or before September 30, 2007.\u201d Based on the \u201cunwind\u201d provision in the Deed, the Town raises two intriguing issues, which, if not moot by now,<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> may figure later in the case on remand or if a final judgment is appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-6\">The first is that the \u201cunwind\u201d provision negates the existence of an intent on the part of Toll to dedicate the LOS <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>Parcel to the MNCPPC. In <em>Harlan v. Town of Bel Air, </em>we stated the general rule in Maryland that \u201can intent on the part of an owner of land to dedicate [the land] to public use is absolutely essential to constitute a dedication.\u201d <em>Harlan v. Town of Bel Air, </em>178 Md. 260, 265, 13 A.2d 370, 372 (1940) (citing <em>Pitts v. Mayor of Balt., </em>73 Md. 326, 332, 21 A. 52, 53 (1891); <em>Tinges v. Mayor of Balt., </em>51 Md. 600, 609 (1879)). Thus, the Town argues that \u201c[g]iven the \u2018unwind\u2019 provision there [was] not ... a true dedication, and what purports to be a dedication is illusory.\u201d Joining in the Town\u2019s argument is <em>Amicus Curiae, </em>the Maryland Municipal League (\u201cLeague\u201d).<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>The second issue interposed by the Town, due to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>\u201cunwind\u201d provision in the Deed, is a hybridized off-spring of the League\u2019s statutory and common law dedication analyses.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> The Town argues that the MNCPPC has not received an interest in the LOS Parcel via dedication from Toll because the MNCPPC cannot compel Toll to follow through with the dedication. First, the Town notes that the conditional approval of the preliminary plan of subdivision, and Condition 15 in particular, was the product of the Planning Board, and not the MNCPPC. The Montgomery County Planning Board is an entity distinct from the MNCPPC. <em>See </em>Md.Code, Art. 28 \u00a7 7-111(a) (\u201cThe members of the Commission appointed by the governing bodies of each county are designated the Montgomery County Planning Board and the Prince George\u2019s County Planning Board, respectively. They are responsible for planning, platting, and zoning functions primarily local in scope, as distinguished from the regional planning functions of the Commission relating to or affecting the regional district as a planning unit____\u201d); County Code, \u00a7 50-4 (\u201cThis chapter [entitled Chapter 50, Subdivision of Land] shall be administered by the county planning board.\u201d). Under the County Code, an approved subdivision plan is only a predictor of possible future development, subject to the discretion of the developer/applicant or successor in interest to pursue further the development and subdivision process under the approved plan. <em>See </em>County Code, \u00a7\u00a7 50-34 to -35. The Town asserts that because the MNCPPC was not the approving authority of Toll\u2019s preliminary development plans, including Condition 15, and because under Chapter 50 of the County Code there is no means by which the Planning Board may compel Toll to follow through -with the development at the plan-approval stage, including satisfaction of Condition 15, there is an insufficient basis on which to find that the MNCPPC acquired a colorable interest in the LOS Parcel pursuant to the Deed of Dedication.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-6\">First, the Town\u2019s and the League\u2019s reliance on <em>MeCaw </em>is unavailing. In <em>McCaw, </em>the Court was faced with the issue of whether a recorded subdivision plat, on which land was dedi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>cated to public use, may be abandoned under a law that provided that such plats may be abandoned only if no injury will be suffered by persons other than the developers. <em>McCaw, </em>246 Md. at 666, 229 A.2d at 585. In 1908, the original owner and developer of a tract of land in Prince George\u2019s County subdivided the land and duly recorded the plans, which included areas dedicated for public use for streets. <em>McCaw, </em>246 Md. at 666, 229 A.2d at 586. In 1963, McCaw purchased a tract of land, which included the 1908 subdivision, and in 1965 petitioned the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County for leave to abandon the previously recorded plats. <em>McCaw, </em>246 Md. at 666-67, 229 A.2d at 586. We held that the MNCPPC, the only party to oppose the abandonment, had standing to argue for continuation of the dedication, and that there was a sufficient showing of possible damage to the public interest to prevent approval of McCaw\u2019s proposed abandonment. <em>McCaw, 246 </em>Md. at 672, 676-77, 229 A.2d at 589, 592-93.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-4\">The procedure through which the land was dedicated in 1908 did not require the approval, or even the involvement, of any governmental entity, other than the Clerk of the Circuit Court of the plats to be recorded (who was obliged to record preferred plats as a relatively ministerial function). <em>See McCaw, </em>246 Md. at 685 n. 1, 229 A.2d at 596 n. 1 (Barnes, J., dissenting) (\u201cIt will be observed that in the original Act of 1908 there was no provision for approval of the subdivision plat by the County Commissioners, or the Planning Commission or any other public body of like nature. Indeed there was no Planning Commission in existence in 1908. The Commission was not created until April 16, 1927 by the Act of 1927, ch. 448. Under the 1908 Act, the Clerk of the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County was <em>directed </em>to file the subdivision plat when offered for recordation <em>by the owner of the land </em>when there had been compliance with the provisions of the Act.\u201d) (emphasis in original). The developer/owner would simply submit a plat to the Clerk and, upon recording, the plat would be, in and of itself, the valid dedication. <em>See McCaw, </em>246 Md. at 676, 229 A.2d at 591 (\u201cHere, the public <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>easement effected by the recording of the subdivision plat is for the public use of streets.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b114-4\">In the statutory scheme of the case <em>sub judice, </em>the procedure through which a dedication is arrived at and perfected, and the implications therefrom, are substantially different from that in <em>McCaw. </em>In <em>McCaw, </em>because the developer was the stimulus and source for the dedication, and because such dedications were more or less a functional part of the developer\u2019s own plans, the rule from <em>McCaw </em>relied on here that \u201c[wjhen a parcel of land is dedicated as a street or for other public use, the owner of the land retains his fee simple interest, subject to an easement for the public,\u201d <em>McCaw, </em>246 Md. at 675, 229 A.2d at 591, was appropriate to the dedication process addressed in that case. In the present case, the subdivision regulatory scheme, including provisions for dedications, was not solely in the hands of the developer. Rather, the Planning Board, the governmental entity charged with approving subdivision plans, imposed the relevant dedication as a condition to be complied with in order for the particular plan proposed by Toll to be approved. More specifically, the dedicated land was to be conveyed to a specific governmental entity, the MNCPPC, for its specific park and planning functions, and not simply for the more general public use as in <em>McCaw. </em>Based on these considerations, we find that the rule announced in <em>McCaw </em>is not necessarily one of general application to all public dedications and specifically is inapplicable to the present case.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> .</p>\n<p id=\"b116-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>Second, relating back to the second requirement for intervention under Md. Rule 2-214, we must resolve at this stage of the litigation only whether the MNCPPC \u201cclaims an interest relating to the property or transaction that is the subject of the action,\u201d and not whether it \u201cowns\u201d or \u201cholds\u201d such an interest. Although the authorities and arguments presented by the Town that the MNCPPC presently does not \u201cown\u201d an interest in the LOS Parcel ultimately may carry the day, we nonetheless find that the MNCPPC is situated sufficiently to \u201cclaim\u201d an interest in the LOS Parcel. There is authority to the effect that, in dedicating land, the dedicator may impose such reasonable conditions, restrictions, and limitations as the dedicator may see fit, so long as the conditions are not repugnant to the dedication or against public policy. <em>City of Kechi v. Decker, </em>230 Kan. 315, 634 P.2d 1099, 1103 (1981); <em>Callahan v. Ganneston Park Dev. Corp., </em>245 A.2d 274, 278 (Me.1968); <em>Roaring Springs Town-Site Co. v. Paducah Tel. Co., </em>109 Tex. 452, 212 S.W. 147, 148-49 (1919); <em>Lynchburg Traction &amp; Light Co. v. City of Lynchburg, </em>142 Va. 255, 128 S.E. 606 (1925); <em>N. Spokane Irrigation Dist. No. 8 v. County of Spokane, </em>86 Wash.2d 599, 547 P.2d 859, 861 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b116-4\">In the present case, the purpose for which the Deed of Dedication was delivered by Toll was purportedly to satisfy Condition 15 of the subdivision approval in order for Toll to be able to move forward in pursuing the development of its property under Preliminary Plan No. 1-02022. Prior to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>issuance of the subdivision approval, negotiations had occurred between Toll and the Town lor several years concerning the preservation of the LOS Parcel as a part of the development of the entire tract. It was logical and reasonable, therefore, for Toll to protect itself against a situation in which it would have dedicated irrevocably the LOS Parcel to the MNCPPC, and yet lost its ability to carry out its development opportunity because of the expiration of the Preliminary Plan approval. Further, the Deed of Dedication contained the following provision requiring Toll and the MNCPPC respectively to work toward final approval of Phase I:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b117-4\">5. Processing of Phase I Site Plan and Plat.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b117-5\">Prior to the date of this Agreement, Toll filed with the Commission its proposed site plan for Phase 1. At a future date, Toll intends to file with the Commission its proposed final plat of subdivision for Phase I. From and after the date of this Agreement with respect to the Phase I site plan and from and after the date of filing with respect to the Phase I plat, the Commission shall proceed expeditiously and in good faith, with reasonable diligence, to review and process Toll\u2019s submissions so that the Phase I site plan and Phase I plat may be approved by the Planning Board at the earliest practicable time.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b117-6\">Therefore, we disagree with the Town\u2019s assertions that the \u201cunwind\u201d provision in the Deed of Dedication necessarily precludes the possibility that dedication of the LOS Parcel by Toll to the MNCPPC may have been achieved in the delivery of that document. We do not need, however, to determine here whether the dedication was achieved. We conclude only that there is a sufficient legal and factual basis upon which to conclude that the MNCPPC is or could be bound by a judgment in the condemnation action.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-7\">b.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-8\">The Town also advances the notion that the MNCPPC was denied intervention properly under the Maryland doctrine of <em>lis pendens. </em>The doctrine of <em>lis pendens </em>is the subject of Md. Rule 12-102, which provides, in pertinent part,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b118-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>(a) Scope.

Due to the specificity of the requirements and guidelines set out in Chapter 200 of Title 12, and the purpose and effect of condemnation proceedings generally, it appears likely that condemnation actions in Maryland satisfy the <em>lis pendens </em>criteria set forth in <em>Greenpoint Mortgage Funding </em>that there be a \u201cproceeding directly relating to the property in question,\u201d or a proceeding in which \u201cthe ultimate interest and object ... is to subject the property in question to the disposal of a decree of the court.\u201d <em>Greenpoint Mortgage Funding, </em>390 Md. at 223, 888 A.2d at 304-05; <em>see also DeShields v.

No party or <em>amici </em>notes a case from any jurisdiction in which a court concluded that the doctrine of <em>Us pendens </em>is inapplicable to a condemnation action. Thus, because Md. Rule 12-102 provides generally that <em>Us pendens </em>applies to \u201can action .. . filed in a circuit court ... that affects title to ... real property located in this State,\u201d and in light of the apparent support at common law, we agree with the Town that the Maryland doctrine of <em>lis pendens </em>is applicable to condemnation actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>Having resolved that the Maryland doctrine of <em>lis pendens </em>is applicable to the Town\u2019s condemnation action, the Town would have us further determine that, under <em>Stockett v. Goodman, </em>47 Md. 54 (1877), and <em>Sinclair v. Auxiliary Realty Co., </em>99 Md. 223, 57 A. 664 (1904), the application of <em>lis pendens </em>to the present case operates as a bar to the MNCPPC\u2019s participation as a party in the Town\u2019s condemnation action. We shall decline to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-4\">In <em>Stockett, </em>this Court addressed the issues of which persons were appropriate parties to an action in the circuit court, and what real property interests each party respectively could assert, where a grantor-appellant (Stockett) had granted or deeded numerous interests in the same real property to multiple persons. In 1874, the appellee in the case filed a complaint in equity in the circuit court, as administratrix of the estate William R. Goodman, seeking to foreclose on certain mortgages executed by Stockett during the lifetime of Goodman. <em>Stockett, </em>47 Md. at 57-59. The complaint alleged that Stockett had given Goodman mortgages on two different properties to secure payment of debts. <em>Stockett, </em>47 Md. at 57-59. In defending against the foreclosure actions, Stockett asserted two main defenses: (a) that as to a certain portion of each of the lands mortgaged, he had only a remainder in fee after the expiration of a life estate, so that he could not have mortgaged any greater estate in those lands; and (b) that prior to execution of one of the mortgages to Goodman, Stockett conveyed a part of the real estate to John Wolf, and thus the portion conveyed was exempt from the mortgage later granted to Goodman. <em>Stockett, </em>47 Md. at 57-59. In 1875, about a year after commencement of the foreclosure action by the administratrix, Stockett, joined by his wife, conveyed all of his property to two trustees. <em>Stockett, </em>47 Md. at 57-59. In February 1876, the trustees filed a petition in the circuit court alleging that Stockett\u2019s wife had not joined in the prior mortgages executed by him. <em>Stockett, </em>47 Md. at 57-59. Thus, the trustees asserted that, because the wife never joined, her contingent rights of dower were not conveyed in any of the mortgages until the deed of trust, and that, as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>result, they held the wife\u2019s contingent rights. <em>Stockett, </em>47 Md. at 57-59. The circuit court denied the petition. <em>Stockett, </em>47 Md. at 60.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-4\">In affirming the denial of the trustees\u2019 petition, the Court found</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-5\">After the commencement of the proceedings in this case and the filing of the answer, the defendant Stockett, on the 13th of April, 1875, executed to certain trustees, for the benefit of his creditors, a deed, in which his wife united, of all his property, except certain reservations to her in consideration of the surrender of her right of dower. On the 8th day of February, 1876, these trustees filed a petition, and with it their deed as an exhibit, asking to be admitted as parties defendants in this suit. The Circuit Court refused their application, and passed an order dismissing their petition. We can see no reason why they should have been admitted as parties. They are assignees under a voluntary deed made to them <em>pendente lite, </em>and subject to all the equities of the defendant. They stand in no better position than the person under whom they claim, and can set up no defense which he cannot. Their rights are entirely in subjection to his, and to admit them as parties now would delay the complainant\u2019s proceedings, and could not change the result as against this defendant. If assignees <em>pendente lite </em>can claim the right of becoming parties, the litigation, by successive assignments, might be rendered interminable. <em>Sedgwick v. Cleaveland, </em>7 Paige, 290; Story\u2019s Eq. Pl. sec. 156.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b123-6\"><em>Stockett, </em>47 Md. at 60.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-7\">A similar scenario presented in <em>Sinclair. </em>In April 1901, Annie Lampkin filed a bill of complaint in the circuit court against Elizabeth Smith and Frank St. Clair Smith, seeking to vacate a deed made by Elizabeth to Frank on the ground that the transaction was fraudulent as to Lampkin\u2019s rights as a creditor of Elizabeth. <em>Sinclair, </em>99 Md. at 225, 57 A. at 664-65. Elizabeth answered denying an intent to defraud Lamp-kin. Frank filed an answer denying the indebtedness of Elizabeth to Lampkin. <em>Sinclair, </em>99 Md. at 225, 57 A. at 665. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>While the action was pending before the circuit court, in May 1902, the Auxiliary Realty Company (\u201cAuxiliary\u201d) filed a petition alleging that, in March 1902, George Wiegal conveyed the property at issue to Auxiliary, that Wiegal had acquired title to the property by deed of 3 January 1902 from Frank, and that when Wiegal and Auxiliary both acquired their interests, each was a good faith purchaser without knowledge of the pending proceeding between Lampkin and the Smiths. <em>Sinclair, </em>99 Md. at 226, 57 A. at 665. The case reached this Court for review of a procedural ruling of the circuit court sustaining Auxiliary\u2019s demurrer<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> to Lampkin\u2019s original bill of complaint and to A. Leftwich Sinclair\u2019s petition to allow Sinclair to participate as a party plaintiff in the action.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> <em>Sinclair, </em>99 Md. at 228, 57 A. at 666.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>One of the points raised in Auxiliary\u2019s demurrer was that because Elizabeth Smith had passed away, even if she had fraudulently conveyed the property to Frank St. Clair Smith during her life, her death caused whatever interest she retained in the property to vest by inheritance in Frank as her heir, thus abating the fraudulent conveyance action and, with that, the need for Lilian St. Clair Brady\u2019s participation<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> as a defendant in the action. Sinclair, 99 Md. at 231, 57 A. at 667. The Court of Appeals disagreed with Auxiliary\u2019s assertion, and found that under statutory law at the time Lilian St. Clair Brady, as heir of Frank St. Clair Smith, retained the right to assert whatever defenses Frank had to the original action of fraudulent conveyance. Sinclair, 99 Md. at 233, 57 A. at 668.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-4\">In rejecting Auxiliary\u2019s assertion that Lilian St. Clair Brady\u2019s participation in the proceedings was not necessary because Frank St. Clair Smith\u2019s later (than Elizabeth\u2019s) death rendered the fraudulent conveyance claim moot, we recognized the significance of the participation of either Frank or Lilian in the proceedings, as opposed to Auxiliary, because the initial bill of complaint was premised on the fraudulent conveyance action. The Court stated</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-5\">It cannot be doubted, especially under the <em>Act of 1892, </em>that the heirs at law of a deceased defendant may be brought in upon petition when the subject of the controversy is real estate in which the heir at law may have an interest. If this controversy had not been complicated by the conveyance to Wiegal and by the deed from Wiegal to [Auxiliary], it would hardly be suggested that upon the death of Elizabeth Smith the suit could not have proceeded against Frank St. Smith, the grantee. And it is equally clear that upon the death of Frank St. Clair Smith, his heir at law would have been the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>proper party to have succeeded him, as defendant on the docket. If the <em>Act of 1892 </em>is operative at all it would certainly have applied to that situation, and under it Lilian St. Clair Brady could have been made a party defendant on a short petition as therein provided, without the necessity of filing a bill of revivor or an original bill in the nature of a bill of revivor. If that be so, how did the conveyance from Wiegal to [Auxiliary] alter the situation? Both Wiegal and [Auxiliary] were purchasers <em>pendente lite </em>and consequently are not necessary parties to the proceeding.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b126-4\"><em>Sinclair, </em>99 Md. at 232, 57 A. at 667. The Court then quoted from <em>Stockett, </em>47 Md. at 60, <em>infra, </em>to support the notion that Wiegal and Auxiliary were not indispensable parties in the proceedings because whatever interests they received in the property, if any, were contingent upon resolution of the fraudulent conveyance claim against the heir of Frank St. Clair Smith. <em>See Sinclair, </em>99 Md. at 232-33, 57 A. at 667-68.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">The Town emphasizes the language quoted above from <em>Stockett, </em>as repeated and applied in <em>Sinclair, </em>to support the argument that the Maryland doctrine of <em>lis pendens </em>bars the MNCPPC\u2019s participation as a party defendant in the Town\u2019s condemnation action. We are not persuaded. In both <em>Stockett </em>and <em>Sinclair, </em>the core issues presented to the circuit courts centered on the initial transaction in a series of transactions involving the same land-. The parties whose claims were subject to the application of <em>lis pendens </em>were recipients of potential interests through the transactions subsequent to, and completely independent of, the ones being challenged in the original action. In <em>Stockett, </em>the trustees sought to intervene to assert their rights to the property in an action in which the dispute between the original parties concerned whether the owner of the property had conveyed previously, before the trustees were ever involved, any and all interests he held in the property. Similarly, in <em>Sinclair, </em>Auxiliary sought to intervene in an action between a creditor and grantor over whether the conveyance between the grantor and first grantee was fraudulent, but where Auxiliary did not receive its potential interest in the property until two conveyances thereafter.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>We interpret <em>Stockett </em>and <em>Sinclair </em>not as establishing absolute bars to participation by persons receiving potential interests in real property <em>pendente lite, </em>but as preventing, regardless of the doctrine of <em>lis pendens, </em>persons from participating as parties unnecessarily in actions in which their interests in the property in question derive entirely from transactions subsequent to, and completely independent of, the transaction called into question in the original action, such that those persons fail to add any substantive interests or claims of their own that relate to the original transaction that are not represented already by the original parties.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> This interpretation is consistent with <em>Stockett </em>because in that case the Court made clear that much of the rationale for its affirmance of the denial of the trustees\u2019 bid to participate was due to the Court\u2019s recognition that the trustees would not add substantive claims or defenses not pursued already, or available to be pursued, by the plaintiff and defendant. The Court stated that \u201c[t]he complainant in this case has proceeded with regularity to obtain a decree, and we find nothing in the record which should subject her to further delay and costs. We will therefore affirm the decree of the Circuit Court.\u201d <em>Stockett, </em>47 Md. at 60. This interpretation is also consistent with <em>Sinclair, </em>where the Court recognized that, although Auxiliary may not be a necessary party to the proceedings in the circuit court, that does not amount to an automatic bar to Auxiliary\u2019s participation in the proceedings in the circuit court. Rather, Auxiliary was permitted to continue to pursue its claims related to the property in the circuit court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b128-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>Independently of all that has just been said on this branch of the case, [Auxiliary] is, upon its own application, in point of fact, an actual party to the cause. It came in by petition. It was made a party at its own request and surely it is in no condition to complain, after thus becoming a party, that it was not made a party upon the motion or petition of the plaintiff. Being a party, it may make its defence as fully as though it had been brought in upon the petition of the plaintiff and it cannot be prejudiced by joining with it, as a co-defendant, the heir at law of Frank St. Clair Smith, who in his lifetime was one of the original defendants.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b128-4\"><em>Sinclair, </em>99 Md. at 233-34, 57 A. at 668.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">That we have not interpreted the Maryland doctrine of <em>lis pendens </em>to pose a substantive bar to participation in an action by a purported subsequent transferee of the subject property is also implicit in <em>Greenpoint Mortgage Funding. </em>In that case, Judge Cathell explained the apparent origin of the doctrine of <em>lis pendens </em>and its intended application in litigation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b128-6\"><em>Lis pendens, </em>a doctrine with deep roots in the English courts of chancery, apparently can be traced to around 1618 during Sir Francis Bacon\u2019s time serving as Lord Keeper of the Great Seal.

Its essence, then, is one of notice to an otherwise unknowing party.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b128-9\"><em>Lis pendens </em>has no specific separate existence apart from its basic function to advise a person who seeks to acquire an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>interest in property subject to a <em>Us pendens </em>that he will be bound by the outcome of the noticed litigation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b129-4\"><em>Greenpoint Martgage Funding, </em>390 Md. at 221-22, 888 A.2d at 803-04. Therefore, although we conclude that the Maryland doctrine of <em>lis pendens </em>may be applicable to condemnation actions generally, the doctrine of <em>lis pendens </em>does not provide a substantive bar to the MNCPPC\u2019s participation as a party defendant in the Town\u2019s condemnation action here. Rather, the proper application of the doctrine of <em>Us pendens </em>in the present case creates \u201c \u2018a priority in favor of the [Town], which, if the [Town ultimately] succeeds on the merits of the claim, relates back to the date of the filing of the complaint\u2019 \u201d and, thus, preserves for the Town \u201c \u2018the opportunity to have a[n equity] relating back to the date of the filing of the complaint.\u2019 \u201d <em>DeShields, </em>338 Md. at 435, 659 A.2d at 306 (citation omitted); <em>see DeShields, </em>338 Md. at 435, 659 A.2d at 306 (\u201cA <em>\u2018lis pendens </em>is a general notice of an equity to all the world,\u2019 not notice of an actual lien.\u201d (quoting <em>Applegarth v.

Kamara, </em>356 Md. 426, 739 A.2d 387 (1999), we resolved that the person seeking intervention, the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (\u201cWMATA\u201d), was so situated that the circuit court permitted properly the WMATA\u2019s intervention in the initial \u201cfriendly suit\u201d action<footnotemark>32</footnotemark>. The standard that we adopted from the Court of Special Appeals\u2019s opinion in that case was whether \u201cthe disposition of the action would at least potentially impair the applicant\u2019s ability to protect its interest.\u201d <em>Chapman, </em>356 Md. at 443, 739 A.2d at 396.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>In <em>Chapman, </em>we affirmed the circuit court\u2019s conclusion that the WMATA was entitled to intervene in an action, stemming from a fatal one-car accident, for damages sought by the parents of multiple passenger-victims against the estate of the allegedly negligent driver.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> <em>Chapman, </em>356 Md. at 430, 445, 739 A.2d at 389, 397. The WMATA sought to intervene because the parent of the driver of the vehicle, who was appointed personal representative of the driver\u2019s estate, filed a separate action against the WMATA alleging that a WMATA bus negligently contributed to the accident. <em>Chapman, </em>356 Md. at 431, 739 A.2d at 390. The WMATA caused that separate action to be removed to the United States District Court for the District of Maryland. <em>Chapman, </em>356 Md. at 432, 739 A.2d at 390. In the litigation remaining in the circuit court, however, the same parent who filed the separate action against the WMATA agreed to a consent judgment to settle the claims of other passengers. The consent judgment contained a stipulation that the driver of the vehicle was negligent. <em>Chapman, </em>356 Md. at 431-32, 739 A.2d at 390.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-4\">The defendants in the circuit court action then filed a motion to vacate the consent judgment, alleging lack of personal jurisdiction and defective service of process. <em>Chapman, </em>356 Md. at 432, 739 A.2d at 390. Because the plaintiffs did not oppose that motion, the WMATA sought to intervene as a matter of right to oppose the motion. <em>See Chapman, </em>356 Md. at 432-33, 739 A.2d at 390. The WMATA argued that it had a sufficient interest in opposing the motion to vacate to justify intervention because the consent judgment stipulation implied the driver\u2019s negligence, and such negligence would establish contributory negligence as a bar to the action for negligence against the WMATA then pending in the federal court. <em>Chapman, </em>356 Md. at 433, 443-45, 739 A.2d at 390, 396-97. We agreed with the WMATA, and found that because \u201cresolution of the motion to vacate has a direct effect on WMATA\u2019s position in the subsequent federal lawsuit,\u201d the WMATA was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>so situated that disposition of the matter pending in the circuit court, as a practical matter, may impair or impede its ability to protect its interest. <em>Chapman, </em>356 Md. at 445, 739 A.2d at 397.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-4\">The MNCPPC has at least as strong a position here, if not stronger, than that of the WMATA in <em>Chapman. </em>The disposition of the Town\u2019s condemnation action against Toll potentially would impair the MNCPPC\u2019s ability to protect its interest, albeit a contingent one, in the LOS Parcel arising from the subdivision process, whether viewed in light of the shelf life of the plan approval or the language of the Deed of Dedication. In <em>Chapman, </em>we found the WMATA\u2019s position relative to the action pending in the circuit court sufficient to justify the WMATA\u2019s intervention because of the collateral estoppel implications the parties\u2019 positions in the circuit court action would have created for the action against the WMATA in the federal court. By seeking intervention in the circuit court action to try to ensure that the parties involved in that action did not change their stipulated position regarding the driver\u2019s negligence, the WMATA sought to preserve the full defense it potentially had in the federal action where it was the defendant. Even if the motion to vacate the consent judgment in the circuit court suit was granted, however, the WMATA nonetheless could proceed to trial in the federal court on the merits of the negligence claim against it.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">The MNCPPC is seeking to defend, more so than the WMATA was in <em>Chapman, </em>a direct interest in the outcome of the condemnation action by the Town against Toll. The Planning Board\u2019s approval of the preliminary subdivision plan, including Condition 15 requiring Toll to dedicate the LOS Parcel to the MNCPPC, was the result of several years of negotiation that preceded that action. Notably, the negotiating and planning process, as discussed in the approval, included participation by at least the Planning Board, representatives of the Town, and Toll. As far as the record and the litigants\u2019 briefs reveal to us, neither the Town nor any other party to the subdivision proceedings opposed or challenged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>the Planning Board\u2019s requirement in its 11 July 2005 approval that Toll dedicate the LOS Parcel to the MNCPPC, until the Town Council adopted its Resolution 2005-06 on 6 September 2005 authorizing initiation of the condemnation action. Because the Town participated in the Planning Board approval process, there was no indication to anyone involved, including the MNCPPC, that the Town desired to pre-empt dedication of the LOS Parcel to the MNCPPC until the unilateral action by the Town. Thus, the MNCPPC had no other opportunity or forum to oppose or otherwise resolve the Town\u2019s action, other than its ability to participate in the Town\u2019s condemnation action against Toll and the LOS Parcel. Given these circumstances, we find that \u201cthe disposition of the action would at least potentially impair the [MNCPPC\u2019s] ability to protect its interest\u201d in this matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-4\">4.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">\u201cIn determining an adequacy of representation issue ..., one\u2019s attention must necessarily be directed to a comparison of the interest asserted by the intervention applicant with that of each existing party.\u201d <em>Md.

Miller &amp; mary kay kane, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 1909, at 524 (1972)).</p>\n<p id=\"b133-4\">In the case <em>sub judice, </em>the MNCPPC sought intervention in the Town\u2019s condemnation action to defend the interest it expected to receive pursuant to Condition 15 of the approved preliminary plan of subdivision. The MNCPPC\u2019s primary aim in defending that interest was to oppose the Town\u2019s condemnation action on grounds that the action was beyond the Town\u2019s legal authority and/or an undue inhibition on the MNCPPC\u2019s authority to acquire property in the Metropolitan District for its park functions. Toll also opposed the Town\u2019s condemnation action, but its opposition was motivated by its concern that the Town\u2019s condemnation, if successful, might frustrate its development plans from moving forward based on its inability to comply with the approved preliminary plan of subdivision. As indicated by the positions taken in the dueling motions for summary judgment in the Circuit Court,<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> the main warrior in the legal opposition to the Town\u2019s action was the MNCPPC, which, at best, was supported only indirectly by Toll. Toll\u2019s motion for summary judgment adopted by reference the arguments made by the MNCPPC in its first <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>motion for summary judgment challenging the Town\u2019s legal authority and public purpose for condemning the LOS Parcel. In that same motion, although Toll agreed with the MNCPPC\u2019s position that the MNCPPC may have a \u201cgovernmental interest\u201d in the LOS Parcel, Toll took the position that \u201cno compensable property interest vested in the Commission related to the [LOS Parcel]\u201d because Toll had not yet recorded plats of the subdivision consistent with the approved site plan. Finally, in Toll\u2019s supplemental memorandum in support of its motion for summary judgment, Toll adopted by reference the MNCPPC\u2019s second supplemental memorandum as its supplemental memorandum.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-4\">Although we recognize that Toll had a strong incentive to oppose the Town\u2019s condemnation action because the condemnation, if successful, might preclude Toll, after years of investment, from being able to pursue further the development under the approved subdivision plan, the MNCPPC had its own grounds, at times in conflict with Toll\u2019s, for opposing the Town\u2019s action. Only the MNCPPC possessed the incentive to pursue those grounds of opposition in the proceedings in the Circuit Court. In light of these circumstances, we conclude that although the MNCPPC and Toll had similar, but not identical interests, in the condemnation action, the MNCPPC\u2019s interests were not adequately represented by an existing party to the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-6\">The Circuit Court entered a partial summary judgment on the merits of the Town\u2019s legal ability to condemn property beyond its municipal boundaries. The legal correctness of that interlocutory judgment is not presently ripe for consideration by this Court. We reverse here only the Circuit Court\u2019s denial of the MNCPPC\u2019s motion to intervene.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-7\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR MONTGOMERY COUNTY DENYING THE MARYLAND-NATIONAL CAPITAL PARK AND PLANNING COMMISSION\u2019S MOTION TO INTERVENE REVERSED; STAY <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>ENTERED BY THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS ON OR ABOUT 26 JUNE 2008 VACATED; CASE REMANDED TO THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR FURTHER PROCEEDINGS NOT INCONSISTENT WITH THIS OPINION; COSTS TO BE PAID BY TOWN OF WASHINGTON GROVE.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b73-8\">.

The cumulative validity period of all phases may not exceed the APFO [Adequate Public Facilities Ordinance] validity period which runs from the date of the initial preliminary plan approval including any extensions granted under Section 50-20(c)(5).

The filing of a new preliminary plan would not lay the basis for reclaiming trips lost by termination of the APFO approval.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b76-8\">(iv) A project that is not timely validated may also cause a preliminary plan approval conditionally linked to such project plan approval to simultaneously expire.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b76-9\">Section 50-35(h)(E)(4) further provides that the Planning Board may, by resolution, revoke approval of a preliminary plan</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AT\">upon a finding by the Board that any conditions attached to the approval of such preliminary plan have become inapplicable or that the plan itself has been rendered impractical by reason of an amendment or addition to the general plan or any portion thereof, or by a proposed public improvement which conflicts with such plan or other conditions or circumstances which involve injury or damage to the public health, safety or welfare.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b76-10\">.

Friedel, </em>216 Md. 11, 14-15, 139 A.2d 259, 261 (1958) (\u201cWhere a proceeding is <em>in rem </em>and the ultimate decree will finally determine some interest, claim, or property right of the petitioner, the petitioner has a right to intervene ...; but, generally, the privilege of intervening is within the discretion of the trial court, measured in light of the intervenor's interest in the subject matter of the suit and the issues raised by the proceedings. However, the exercise of this discretion is reviewable upon appeal if it amounts to an abuse thereof by the trial court.\u201d) (citation omitted); <em>Nyburg v.

The exercise ol that discretion as to the right of intervention, generally is not subject to appeal; it may be if the action of the court amounts to an abuse of discretion.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">The abuse of discretion standard of review for all denial rulings on intervention remained until the adoption of Md. Rule 208, the predecessor to the current Md. Rule 2-214. With the adoption of Md. Rule 208, a rule of procedure derived from Fed R.Civ P. 24, which provided that a person \u201cshall be permitted to intervene in an action\" by right if certain standards are satisfied, the Court recognized that abuse of discretion review for rulings on motions to intervene as of right, although in line with Maryland precedent, likely was inconsistent with the intent of Md. Rule 208. The shift in thinking was recognized in <em>Citizens Coordinating Committee, </em>where this Court stated</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b97-6\">Although we have never flatly passed upon the appealability of an order denying intervention asserted as a matter of right, the Court of Special Appeals has recently done so in <em>Nat'l 4-H Club v. Thorpe, </em>22 Md.App. 1, 9, 321 A.2d 321 (1974). There, it held that the denial of inteivention claimed as of right under Rule 208 a is an appealable order. In so holding, it followed a line of cases decided under Rule 24 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, the relevant part of which, in its pre-1966 form, was identical to Rule 208 a. Where intervention is permissive, however, the order denying intervention is appealable only if the court has abused its discretion. 3B Moore\u2019s Federal Practice \u00b6 24.15. Prior to the adoption of our rules of procedure, when there was no provision for intervention as a matter of right, we had applied the latter rule in Maryland. <em>See, e.g., Weinberg v. Fanning, </em>208 Md. 567, 571, 119 A.2d 383 (1956); <em>Stirn v. Radio-Keith Etc. Corp., </em>163 Md. 398, 400-01, 163 A. 696 (1933).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b97-7\">The federal appellate courts traditionally have followed a general rule of reversing an erroneous denial by the trial court of intervention of right or abuse of discretion in denying permissive intervention, but dismissing the appeal where the trial court had properly denied the application for intervention. <em>See generally, </em>Moore's Federal Practice, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number><em>supra; </em>C. Wright &amp; A. Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure, Civil, \u00a7 1923 (1972). Later cases, however, have recognized the impracticability of resolving the threshold issue of appealability without first deciding the merits. <em>See, e.g., Levin v. Ruby Trading Corporation, </em>333 F.2d 592, 594 (2d Cir.1964).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-5\">The recent trend, therefore, has been in the direction of recognizing the necessity of examining the propriety of the denial by the trial court. Under this view, the appellate court affirms where the denial of the intervention is deemed to be correct and reverses where it concludes that intervention of right was erroneously denied or the trial court abused its discretion in refusing to allow permissive intervention, in effect treating the denial as an appealable order. Moore\u2019s Federal Practice; Wright &amp; Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure, both <em>supra. </em>In <em>Nat'l 4</em>\u2014H <em>Club v. Thorpe, supra, 22 </em>Md.App. at 9, 321 A.2d 321, the Court of Special Appeals made explicit reference to this shift in the federal decisions and affirmed a denial of intervention after finding the appellant there to be without any right to intervene under Rule 208 a. We think that the procedure applied there and in the more recent federal cases is preferable and we shall follow it here. We simply hold that the denial of intervention claimed as of right under Rule 208 a is appealable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b98-6\"><em>Citizens Coordinating Comm. on Friendship Heights, Inc. v. TKU Assocs., </em>276 Md. 705, 709-10, 351 A.2d 133, 136-37 (1976). Then, in 1978, this Court decided <em>Montgomery County v. Ian Corp., </em>282 Md. 459, 385 A.2d 80 (1978), where we purported to adopt the \"test laid down by the Supreme Court in <em>NAACP [v.

A review of the <em>NAACP </em>case, however, indicates that the Supreme Court only addressed the standard of review for a denial based on timeliness. <em>See NAACP v. New York, </em>413 U.S. at 369, 93 S.Ct. 2591 (\"We therefore conclude that the motion to intervene was untimely and that the District Court did not abuse its discretion in denying the appellants\u2019 motion....

The Deed of Dedication was executed between Toll and the MNCPPC, and, in the \"unwind\u201d provision, there are conditions that could present conflicting interests between Toll and the MNCPPC.

The League's argument is divided into two parts, one relating to statutory dedication and the other to common law dedication. As to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>statutory dedication, the League directs us to <em>McCaw </em>for the rule that a statutory dedication occurs upon compliance with the requirements of a statute. The language of <em>McCaw </em>the League directs us to is: \u201cWhitting<em>ton[ v. Good Shepherd Evangelical Lutheran Church, </em>236 Md. 185, 202 A.2d 751 (1964)], therefore, establishes the rule, which we affirm, that under the statute, the dedication to the public is complete and the interest of the public has vested when the subdivision plat is filed.\u201d <em>McCaw, </em>246 Md. at 673, 229 A.2d at 589-90 (footnote omitted). In the present case, the League argues, because \u00a7 50-15(a) of the County Code requires that \"\u00a1w]hen a plat is recorded, land designated on the plat as a ... public park or square, or other area dedicated to public use must be dedicated in perpetuity to public use,\u201d the absence of a recorded plat forecloses a completed statutory dedication here. Asserting that \"Ls|ection 50-15(a) of the Montgomery County Code parallels the Prince George\u2019s County statute at issue in <em>McCaw, </em>which this Court interpreted as rendering the recordation of a plat dedicating land to public use a completed statutory dedication,\" and noting in this case the absence of a recorded plat by Toll, the League argues that a statutory dedication of the LOS Parcel from Toll to the MNCPPC has not occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-5\">On the common law dedication side, the League looks to this Court\u2019s decision in <em>City of Annapolis v. Waterman, </em>357 Md. 484, 745 A.2d 1000 (2000), for the rule that common law dedications operate by way of equitable estoppel. <em>See Waterman, </em>357 Md. at 504-05, 745 A.2d at 1010-11 (\u201c \u2018Dedication\u2019 is a setting apart of land for the public use, and may be either statutory or at common law, the distinction between a statutory and a common-law dedication being that the statutory dedication operates as a grant, while the common-law dedication operates by way of estoppel in pais ....\u2019\u201d (quoting <em>Priolo v. City of Dallas, </em>257 S.W.2d 947, 953 n. 2 (Tex.Civ.App.1953))). In <em>Waterman, </em>we noted the general elements of common law dedications as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b111-6\">Generally, common-law dedications are voluntary offers to dedicate land to public use, and the subsequent acceptance, in an appropriate fashion, by a public entity. Common-law dedications are not mandated by statute. The offers are generally, although not exclusively, made by showing roads, parks or similar facilities on plats without any limitations on dedication, and the recording of those plats. Generally, acceptance is made by an express recorded document or by the appropriate entity assuming control and maintenance of the property offered. With acceptance, common-law dedication is complete.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b111-7\"><em>Waterman, </em>357 Md. at 503-04, 745 A.2d at 1010. The League argues that due to the \u201cunwind\u201d provision in the Deed of Dedication, Toll has not taken any linal action or made any final representation that it has dedicated unequivocally the LOS Parcel to the MNCPPC, with the result that, until final subdivision approval in accordance with the \u201cunwind\u201d provision in the Deed and some action on the part of the MNCPPC indicating final acceptance of the dedication occurs, Toll has not dedicated the LOS Parcel to the MNCPPC.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"26\">\n<p id=\"b112-7\">. <em>See </em>n. 25, <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"27\">\n<p id=\"b114-5\">. <em>McCaw </em>also was relied upon by the League for its proposition that a statutory dedication occurs only upon compliance with a statute. In <em>McCaw, </em>we interpreted compliance with the statute to have occurred only when the plat was filed. <em>See McCaw, </em>246 Md. at 676, 229 A.2d at 591 (\u201cHere, the public easement effected by the recording of (lie subdivision plat is for the public use of streets.\u201d). The League would have us read County Code, \u00a7 50-15(a)\u2019s language, \u201c[wjhen a plat is recorded, land designated on the plat as a ... public park or square, or other area dedicated to public use must be dedicated in perpetuity to public use,\u201d as the equivalent of the statutory requirement in <em>McCaw, </em>such that the absence of a recorded plat by Toll here frustrates the completion of a statutory dedication of the LOS Parcel. If recording <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>the plat showing land dedicated to public use under County Code, \u00a7 50-15(a) were the only means by which Toll could effectuate the dedication, we might agree; however, a recorded plat is not the only means by which Toll may have consummated the dedication contemplated by the subdivision approval in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-5\">In <em>McCaw, </em>the land dedicated was for general public use as streets, under the only means through which such a dedication then could be achieved, the recording of the plat with the Clerk of the Circuit Court. At that time, for the developer to complete a statutory dedication, everything depended entirely on the developer\u2019s initiative. <em>See McCaw, </em>246 Md. at 685 n. 1, 229 A.2d at 596 n. 1 (Barnes, J., dissenting). Although we recognize that the opportunity provided by County Code, \u00a7 50-15(a), provides one means to effect statutory dedications by recording subdivision plats, similar to the means in <em>McCaw, </em>in the present case, there are other statutory means through which Toll's dedication might be effectuated other than under County Code, \u00a7 50-15(a). Md.Code, Art. 28 \u00a7\u00a7 5-101 and -107 provide that the MNCPPC \"may acquire land or other property,\u201d and that for \"[ljand acquired under this article, title ... shall become vested in the State of Maryland or the LMNCPPCj.\u201d Md.Code, Art. 28 \u00a7\u00a7 5-101, -107. Thus, contrary to the League's argument that a statutory dedication could be achieved only through compliance with County Code, \u00a7 50-15(a), we view Art. 28 \u00a7\u00a7 5 \u2014 101 and -107 as providing other means through which a statutory dedication may be achieved by Toll in the present case. We note that the ullimate determination of whether the statutory dedication was completed in this case would require us to decide whether the statutory dedication was completed upon the transfer of the deed between the dedicator and the MNCPPC, in light of Art. 28 \u00a7 \u00a7 5-101 and -107, or upon the subsequent filing of the plat under County Code, \u00a7 50-15(a) showing the land dedicated to public use. Because of the minimal threshold finding required to be made under Md. Rule 2-214, <em>see infra, </em>however, we do not reach a final merits determination in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-6\">Similarly, the League's argument that the dedication attempted by Toll does not satisfy the requisite intent to accomplish a common law dedication, and the MNCPPC's subsequent acceptance of that intent, is misplaced. In <em>Waterman, </em>we specifically distinguished common law dedications from subdivision dedications:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b115-7\">[I]t is important to understand that not all conditions attached to subdivision approvals or imposed on approved subdivisions are \"subdivision dedications,\u201d and that no such conditions are \u201ccommon-law dedications.\u201d Subdivision dedications and common-law dedications are different creatures as well.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b115-8\">Dedications required under subdivision regulations should be distinguished from common law dedications. Common law dedication involves an offer to dedicate and a corresponding acceptance by a local government. Under common law dedication a developer is estopped from later questioning the acceptance. In subdivision regulation dedication, however, questions of legislative authority and constitutionality arise.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b115-9\"><em>Waterman, </em>357 Md. at 503, 745 A.2d at 1010 (quoting Julian Conrad Juergensmeyer &amp; Thomas E. Roberts, <em>Land Use Planning and Control </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number><em>Law </em>315 (1998)). We further distinguished subdivision dedications from subdivision conditions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b116-7\">A subdivision dedication can be distinguished from a condition imposed on a subdivision approval (whether a reservation or otherwise) depending on the intended recipient. A subdivision dedication requires a developer to give the public the right to use a portion of his property or gives one of the incidents of ownership (e.g., an \"in lieu\u201d fee) to the public at large to use. A subdivision condition, like the provision at issue in this case, merely limits the method in which a property owner may thereafter use the property.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b116-8\"><em>Waterman, </em>357 Md. at 506-07, 745 A.2d at 1011-12. In light of this guidance, we find the League\u2019s common law dedication analysis persuasive, but not binding, in the present case because the present case involves a subdivision dedication.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"28\">\n<p id=\"b124-4\">. Perhaps our newer generations of lawyers do not know what a \"demurrer\" was under former mies and pleading requirements in Maryland. We pause to supply some background. At common law, the demurrer was a procedural pleading filed by defendants seeking to have a plaintiff's complaint dismissed for some legal deficiency affirmatively appearing in the complaint.
