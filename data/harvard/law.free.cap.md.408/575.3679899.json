After Wyeth moved <em>in limine </em>to preclude the testimony of the Blackwells\u2019 experts on grounds that the causal connection between thimerosal and autism is not generally accepted in the relevant scientific community and that the experts were not qualified to testify to such a causal connection, a 10-day evidentiary hearing was held before Judge Stuart R. Berger of the Circuit Court for Baltimore City, in which he addressed the seminal question of \u201cwhether the plaintiffs can support their claim of general causation with science that utilized methods and theories that are generally accepted in the relevant disciplines.\u201d After hearing the testimony of numerous experts presented by both sides,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Judge Berger issued a 57-page Memorandum Opinion, ultimately concluding that the Blackwells had failed to demonstrate that the bases of their proffered experts\u2019 opinions, including the theory of causation and the analytical framework in support thereof, were generally accepted as reliable in the relevant scientific community. Judge Berger also concluded that the Blackwells\u2019 experts were not qualified to testify under Maryland Rule 5-702. Summary judgment was entered in favor of Wyeth, and the Blackwells appealed; we granted certiorari prior to any proceedings in the Court of Special Appeals, <em>Blackwell v. Wyeth, </em>406 Md. 442, 959 A.2d 792 (2008), to address two questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-5\">1. Did the Circuit Court improperly apply the <em>Reed-Frye </em>general acceptance standard to the Blackwells\u2019 experts\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>conclusions, rather than the bases upon which they reached their causation opinions, and impermissibly conduct a trial on the merits by using a heightened scientific certainty standard to determine the admissibility of their expert testimony?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b610-5\">2. Did the Circuit Court apply an erroneous legal standard and abuse its discretion in concluding that the Blackwells\u2019 experts\u2019 testimony is inadmissible because it does not meet the requirements of Md. Rule 5-702?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b610-6\">We shall affirm and conclude that Judge Berger appropriately precluded the Blackwells\u2019 experts\u2019 testimony under <em>Frye-</em>Reed<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and did not abuse his discretion in the application of Maryland Rule 5-702.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-7\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b610-8\">In this case we must address the application of <em>Frye-Reed </em>to theories proffered as scientific and alleged to have been premised on scientifically accepted methodologies. To place <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>this quandary within the appropriate context, we shall begin by discussing the purpose of scientific inquiry and the scientific method, as well as our framework for the admission of expert testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-5\">The quest for truth in the courtroom and the quest for knowledge in science are not necessarily intersecting endeavors. A trial, on the one hand, may be quick and determinative; it is a process by which \u201cadvocates for each side present evidence in the light most favorable to their case, and the finder of fact sifts through it and assesses whether it establishes guilt or liability to the required degree of proof.\u201d <em>See </em>Susan Haack, <em>Of Truth, in Science and in Law, </em>73 Brook. L.Rev. 985, 985-86 (2008). The search for knowledge in science, on the other hand, is rarely quick or final; rather, it represents an ongoing cycle, in which each inquiry into an observable phenomenon is but one aspect of an ongoing quest.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b611-6\">At the heart of this search for knowledge is the use of scientific method \u2014 or the analytical process by which a hypothesis is tested and analyzed and conclusions or theories are developed. This process has also been described as empirical study, that being study, \u201c[fjounded on practical experience, rather than on reasoning alone, but not established scientifically ... [or] testing a hypothesis by careful observation, hence rationally based on experience.\u201d Stedman\u2019s Medical Dictionary 632 (28th ed.2Q06) (\u201cempiric\u201d).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> In basic terms, the development of a theory, using the scientific method or empirical testing, follows characteristic steps:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b611-7\">1. Observations of some phenomenon are made. For example, the movements of planets (which move in more complex orbits than the stars).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b612-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>2. Possible explanations (theories) are proposed for what is observed. (For the movement of planets, one such theory, radical at the time of its first suggestion, was that the movements of planets could be explained by a theory that placed the Sun and not the Earth at the center of our solar system.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b612-5\">3. Hypotheses are logically derived from the theories. (If the Sun is the center of the solar system, then certain other observations should be true. If the Earth is the center of the solar system, that would lead to different predictions.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b612-6\">4. Studies are designed to test the hypotheses. In essence, the study makes new observations that might disconfirm the hypothesis and thereby falsify the theory. Different theories have different implications and lead to different hypotheses. (Ideally, a study can be devised whose outcome will disconfirm one theory\u2019s hypotheses and not the other\u2019s. This is called a \u201ccritical experiment\u201d because it permits a head-to-head test of two or more theories, and helps to determine which has done the best job of accounting for the relevant phenomena. , Sometimes scientific controversies persist for a very long time because no commonly agreed upon critical experiment can be conducted.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b612-7\">5. The results of such empirical tests lead to revision or abandonment of older theories or the creation of still newer and hopefully better theories.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b612-8\">6. The process repeats itself as more empirical tests are conducted and theories undergo continued re-evaluation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b612-9\">David L. Faigman, Michael J. Saks, Joseph Sanders &amp; Edward K. Cheng, 1 Modern Scientific Evidence: The Law and Science of Expert Testimony, at 263-64 (2008). Specifically, once a theory is conceived based on an observable phenomenon, a hypothesis, which is \u201c[a] conjecture advanced for heuristic purposes, cast in a form that is amenable to confirmation or refutation by conducting of definable experiments and the critical assembly of empiric data,\u201d Stedman\u2019s, <em>supra, </em>at 938, is developed, which defines the scope of an experiment. Studies then are designed to test the hypothesis and gather data:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b613-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>To real scientists a finding of fact is only as good as the methods used to find it. Scientific method is the logic by which the observations are made. Well designed methods permit observations that lead to valid, useful, informative answers to the questions that had been framed by the researcher. For scientists, the key word in the phrase \u201cscientific method\u201d is <em>method. </em>Methodology \u2014 the logic of research design, measures, and procedures \u2014 is the engine that generates knowledge that is scientific. While for lawyers and judges credibility is the key to figuring out which witnesses are speaking truth and which are not, for scientists the way to figure out which one of several contradictory studies is most likely correct is to scrutinize the methodology.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b613-5\">Faigman, <em>supra, </em>at 260 (emphasis in original). Once data is compiled, analysis occurs, from which conclusions are drawn; the hypothesis either remains viable or is disproven:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b613-6\">Note that a hypothesis or a theory is never proven or confirmed to be true. Testing is capable only of disconfirming. But theories that withstand such attempts at falsification better and longer become accepted, at least until something better comes along. The opposite approach can readily be seen in non-scientific activities of numerous kinds, where investigators engage in a search for evidence that confirms their suspicions. This confirmatory bias is based on the erroneous assumption that a theory is confirmed by the accumulation of facts consistent with the theory. ... It is the diligent search for inconsistencies, for falsification, that really puts a theory to the test. A theory that can withstand such scrutiny is one that deserves credence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b613-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 264.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-8\">\u201cAt any time there is a whole continuum of scientific ideas, claims, and theories: some [are] so well-warranted by such strong evidence that it is most unlikely they will have to be revised; some not quite so well-warranted but still pretty solidly established; some promising but as yet far from eer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>tain; some new and exciting but highly speculative and as yet untested; and some so wild that few mainstream scientists are willing even to listen.\u201d Haack, <em>supra, </em>at 996. The strength, therefore, of a scientific theory is measured, in part, by its validity, which is \u201cthe extent to which something measures what it purports to measure.\u201d Faigman, <em>supra, </em>at 269. <em>See also </em>Samuel R. Gross <em>&amp; </em>Jennifer L. Mnookin, <em>Expert Information and Expert Evidence: A Preliminary Taxonomy, </em>34 Seton Hall L.Rev. 141, 146^47 (2003) (discussing the distinction between field validity, which is whether a given \u201cfield of knowledge ... has credible tools to produce valid answers,\u201d and method validity, which is whether \u201cthe methods that were used in this instance [were] capable of producing valid answers\u201d). <em>See generally </em>Faigman, <em>supra, </em>Ch. 5, \u201cScientific Method: The Logic of Drawing Inferences from Empirical Evidence,\u201d (discussing numerous research designs, methods of measurement, sampling, relationships among variables and threats to validity). The second variable affecting the strength of a scientific theory is its reliability, which has been defined as,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b614-4\"><em>[RJeliability </em>refers to the ability of a measure to produce the same result each time it is applied to the same thing. Reliability refers to consistency, or reproducibility. If each time a person steps on to a bathroom scale it gives a different reading (while the person\u2019s weight has not changed), then the scale is said to lack reliability.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b614-5\">Faigman, <em>supra, </em>at 269 (italics in original). Both validity and reliability, then, affect whether a scientific theory is accepted in the field in which it is offered.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-6\">General acceptance by other members of the relevant scientific field became the standard for acceptance of a theory, as a result of the opinion of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in <em>Frye v. United States, </em>293 F. 1013, 1014 (D.C.Cir.1923):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b614-7\">Just when a scientific principle or discovery crosses the line between the experimental and demonstrable stages is difficult to define. Somewhere in this twilight zone the evidential force of the principle must be recognized, and while <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>courts will go a long way in admitting expert testimony deduced from a <em>well-recognized </em>scientific principle or discovery, the thing from which the deduction is made must be <em>sufficiently established to have gained general acceptance in the particular field in which it belongs.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b615-4\">(Emphasis added). The <em>Frye </em>\u201cgeneral acceptance\u201d standard was adopted by this Court in <em>Reed v. State, </em>288 Md. 374, 391 A.2d 364 (1978), in which we recognized that the standard did reflect assessment of a theory\u2019s validity and reliability. In <em>Reed, </em>we were confronted with whether voiceprint recognition, consisting of the use of a spectrograph machine to match patterns in an individual\u2019s voice, was admissible, for identification purposes, in a rape case. We concluded that the trial judge erred in admitting the evidence. <em>Id. </em>at 399-400, 391 A.2d at 377. In so doing, Judge John C. Eldridge, writing for this Court, recognized that scientific methodologies or techniques must be generally accepted prior to the admission into evidence of the conclusions reached:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-5\">On occasion, the validity and reliability of a scientific technique may be so broadly and generally accepted in the scientific community that a trial court may take judicial notice of its reliability. Such is commonly the case today with regard to ballistics tests, fingerprint identification, blood tests, and the like. Similarly, a trial court might take judicial notice of the invalidity or unreliability of procedures widely recognized in the scientific community as bogus or experimental. However, if the reliability of a particular technique cannot be judicially noticed, it is necessary that the reliability be demonstrated before testimony based on the technique can be introduced into evidence. Although this demonstration will normally include testimony by witnesses, a court can and should also take notice of law journal articles, articles from reliable sources that appear in scientific journals, and other publications which bear on the degree of acceptance by recognized experts that a particular process has achieved.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b616-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number><em>Id. </em>at 380, 391 A.2d at 367 (internal citations removed). In adopting the <em>Frye </em>test of general acceptance, Judge Eldridge gave guidance regarding its application:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b616-5\">That is to say, before a scientific opinion will be received as evidence at trial, the basis of that opinion must be shown to be generally accepted as reliable within the expert\u2019s particular scientific field. Thus, according to the <em>Frye </em>standard, if a new scientific technique\u2019s validity is in controversy in the relevant scientific community, or if it is generally regarded as an experimental technique, then expert testimony based upon its validity cannot be admitted into evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b616-6\">The identity of the relevant scientific community is, of course, a matter which depends upon the particular technique in question. In general, members of the relevant scientific community will include those whose scientific background and training are sufficient to allow them to comprehend and understand the process and form a judgment about it. In unusual circumstances, a few courts have held that the experts thus qualified might properly be from a somewhat narrower field.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b616-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 381-82, 391 A.2d at 368 (internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b616-8\">We recognized in <em>Reed </em>that seminal scientific technologies may be rejected, because the <em>\u201cFrye </em>standard retards somewhat the admission of proof based on new methods of scientific investigation by requiring that they attain sufficient currency and status to gain the general acceptance of the relevant scientific community,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 385,391 A.2d at 370, quoting <em>United States v. Addison, </em>498 F.2d 741, 743-44 (D.C.Cir.1974), in that \u201c[f]airness to a litigant would seem to require that before the results of a <em>scientific </em>process can be used against him, he is entitled to a <em>scientific </em>judgment on the reliability of that process.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 385, 391 A.2d at 369-70 (emphasis in original). We further recognized that, <em>\u201cFrye </em>was deliberately intended to interpose a substantial obstacle to the unrestrained admission of evidence based upon new scientific principles\u201d because \u201c[l]ay jurors tend to give considerable weight to \u2018scientific\u2019 evidence when presented by \u2018experts\u2019 with impressive credentials.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 386, 391 A.2d at 370, quoting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number><em>People v. Kelly, </em>17 Cal.3d 24, 130 Cal.Rptr. 144, 549 P.2d 1240, 1245 (1976). Accordingly, we concluded that, \u201cfa]s long as the scientific community remains significantly divided, results of controversial techniques will not be admitted, and all [litigants] will face the same burdens. If, on the other hand, a novel scientific process does achieve general acceptance in the scientific community, there will likely be as little dispute over its reliability as there is now concerning other areas of forensic science which have been deemed admissible under the <em>Frye </em>standard, such as blood tests, ballistics tests, etc.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 388, 391 A.2d at 371.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-4\">Since 1978, we have had occasion to elaborate on the application of <em>Frye-Reed </em>to various aspects of the scientific method as well as specific methodologies. In <em>Wilson v. State, </em>370 Md. 191, 803 A.2d 1034 (2002), we addressed whether a trial judge erred in rejecting expert opinion testimony, based upon a generally-accepted statistical calculus \u2014 the product rule.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Wilson had been accused of murder after a second child of his, with a different mother, had died during a night when Wilson was the caretaker. Wilson interposed a SIDS, or Sudden Infant Death Syndrome, defense. At trial, the State proffered the testimony of two experts, who, using the product rule, would. have testified that the probability of a child dying with SIDS with cerebral swelling was 1 and 100,000 \u2014 arrived at by multiplying the statistic that 1 child per 1,000 live births die of SIDS by the statistic that 1 in 10 SIDS deaths involve cerebral swelling \u2014 and that the chance of two SIDS deaths occurring in the same family was 1 in 4,000,000\u2014 arrived at by squaring the rate of 1 child per 2,000 live births to reach the chance of two children dying from SIDS in the same family. Wilson moved <em>in limine </em>to exclude the testimony of the State\u2019s experts, but the trial judge denied the motion. At trial, the experts testified, and in closing argu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>ment, the State specifically referred to the experts\u2019 statistics, stating, \u201c[i]f you multiply his numbers, instead of 1 in 4 million, you get 1 in 10 million that the man sitting here is innocent.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 200, 803 A.2d at 1039. The Court of Special Appeals affirmed the conviction, and we granted certiorari to consider whether the <em>Frye-Reed </em>standard applies to the application of statistical methods, which we answered in the affirmative. <em>Id. </em>at 196, 202-03, 803 A.2d at 1036,1040-41, citing <em>Armstead v. State, </em>342 Md. 38, 673 A.2d 221 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b618-5\">After reiterating the bases of <em>Frye-Reed </em>that, \u201cbefore a scientific expert opinion may be received in evidence, the basis of that opinion must be shown to be generally accepted as reliable within the expert\u2019s particular scientific field,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 203, 803 A.2d at 1041, we addressed whether the use of a generally accepted technique required acceptance of conclusions derived from its use. We concluded that it was not mandated, because one of the necessary predicates to the application of the product rule \u2014 mutual independence of events \u2014 was not considered; genetics may have been the link between the two infants\u2019 deaths:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-6\">We hold that the trial court erred in admitting expert testimony based on the product rule because a condition necessary to the proper application of the product rule was lacking: there was inadequate proof of the independence of Brandi and Garrett\u2019s deaths. As evidenced by the authorities above cited, there is not general agreement in the scientific community as to the relationship between SIDS deaths within a single family. Stated another way, there is not general agreement in the medical community that multiple SIDS deaths in a .single family are genetically unrelated. The literature continues to reflect a lively debate concerning the role of genetics in SIDS.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-7\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-8\">In light of the widespread disagreement as to the causes of SIDS, we are unable to find general acceptance of the notion that there is no genetic component to SIDS. Una<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>nimity is not required for general acceptance, but it is clear to us that a genuine controversy exists within the relevant scientific community. In sum, there was inadequate proof of the statistical independence of SIDS deaths within a single family. Therefore, based on the current state of medical opinion, the product rule should not be employed in calculating the likelihood of multiple SIDS deaths within a single family.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b619-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 209, 210-11, 803 A.2d at 1044-45 (citations omitted). Accepted methodology, then, does not mandate acceptance of conclusions ostensibly developed therefrom.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-6\">We also have had the opportunity to apply <em>Frye-Reed </em>when considering whether a theory, which had been accepted in the scientific and legal communities, continues to meet the standard. Comparative Bullet Lead Analysis (CBLA), by which two bullets are compared to see if they originate from the same original molten source, had gained currency as admissible scientific evidence prior to <em>Clemons v. State, </em>392 Md. 339, 896 A.2d 1059 (2006). In <em>Clemons, </em>the State presented an FBI CBLA expert, who testified that a bullet found at a crime scene and bullets found in a gun possessed by Clemons, seized two days after the crime, originated from the same original source. Clemons moved <em>in limine </em>to exclude the expert\u2019s testimony, arguing that an essential premise of CBLA theory was no longer generally accepted in the relevant scientific community \u2014 that bullets originating from a given ingot or vat of lead were uniquely homogenous. The trial judge admitted the evidence, and the Court of Special Appeals affirmed the conviction. We reversed, holding that the trial judge erred in admitting the CBLA testimony, because it was no longer generally accepted in the field of metallurgy that the elemental composition of the molten source for the creation of bullets was uniform, homogenous or unique. In so holding, we engaged in an in-depth review of the CBLA technique, observing,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-7\">Recently the assumptions regarding that uniformity or homogeneity of the molten source and the uniqueness of each molten source that provide the foundation for CBLA have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>come under attack by the relevant scientific community of analytical chemists and metallurgists[,]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b620-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 368, 896 A.2d 1059,1076, and concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b620-6\">We conclude that CBLA does not satisfy the requirement under the <em>Frye-Reed </em>test for the admissibility of scientific expert testimony <em>because several fundamental assumptions underlying the process are not generally accepted by the scientific community. </em>Therefore, we reverse the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals and remand the case to the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County for a new trial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AvN\"><em>Id. </em>at 372, 896 A.2d at 1079 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b620-7\">More recently, in <em>Montgomery Mutual Insurance Company v. Chesson, </em>399 Md. 314, 923 A.2d 939 (2007), we considered whether a trial judge erred in denying a defendant\u2019s <em>in limine </em>motion for a <em>Frye-Reed </em>hearing to determine the admissibility of expert testimony that exposure to mold caused certain physical ailments, described as either sick building syndrome or bio-toxic illness, \u201ca combination of ailments associated with exposure to modern buildings that lack proper ventilation.\u201d <em>Chesson, </em>399 Md. at 317 n. 1, 923 A.2d at 940-41 n. 1. Montgomery Mutual, a workers\u2019 compensation insurer, alleged that the claimant\u2019s expert\u2019s theory, regarding a causal connection between mold exposure and certain human health effects, had not been generally accepted within the relevant scientific community, nor had the tests used in developing the theory. The trial judge denied the motion without holding a hearing, and the Court of Special Appeals affirmed, stating, <em>inter alia, </em>that the experts utilized medical tests that were generally accepted in the scientific community. <em>Montgomery Mutual Ins. Co. v. Chesson, </em>170 Md.App. 551, 570-71, 907 A.2d 873, 885 (2006).

We disagree and hold that, based on this record, the Circuit Court should have held a <em>Frye-Reed </em>hearing to determine whether the medical community generally accepts the theory that mold exposure causes the illnesses that respondents claimed to have suffered, <em>and the propriety of the tests [the expert] employed to reach his medical conclusions.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b621-5\"><em>Chesson, </em>399 Md. at 328, 923 A.2d at 947 (citations omitted) (emphasis added). <em>See also State v.

For example, many qualified experts could testify in a typical medical malpractice case. While attorneys are stuck with the testimonial limitations of the available fact witnesses, an attorney who needs an expert can \u201cshop\u201d for an expert with a pleasing courtroom manner who will agree with the attorney\u2019s theory of the case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b621-9\">Some of these potential expert witnesses will be venal \u201chired guns.\u201d As Judge Jack Weinstein has noted, \u201c[a]n <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>expert can be found to testify to the truth of almost any factual theory, no matter how frivolous.\u201d Ordinary fact witnesses may also have their biases, but attorneys can only take advantage of these biases if the witnesses already exist; they cannot normally shop for an ordinary fact witness. By contrast, attorneys can seek expert witnesses who will parrot the attorneys\u2019 line, and, indeed, implicitly \u201cbribe\u201d them to do so.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-5\">Moreover, ordinary biases, such as a familial or friendly relationship to one of the parties, can typically be brought out on cross-examination. Some authorities have argued that cross-examination will also reveal an expert witness\u2019 bias to the jury. However, it [is] not at all clear how opposing counsel can discredit a \u201chired gun\u201d expert for taking money for his testimony, given that opposing counsel will have his own expert \u2014 who may be scrupulously honest \u2014 on his payroll. In any event, even if the biases of hired guns can be revealed through cross-examination, that does not resolve the problems caused by expert-shopping. Not all, and perhaps not even most experts who testify to opinions outside the mainstream of their field are venal hired guns. Our system assumes, perhaps optimistically, that the jury can determine if an expert is lying. But what if the expert is simply shading the truth? Or, even more likely, what if the expert is simply eccentric or outside the mainstream? Parties have every incentive to hire \u201coutlier\u201d experts with sincere but extreme views so long as they can conceal the outlier status. There is no reason to hire an expert, for example, who will tell the jury that a client\u2019s losses are worth $150,000 if an attorney can find an equally credible expert willing to testify that the true figure is $300,000. Moreover, there is no ethical obligation on attorneys to hire mainstream experts. Indeed, their duty to zealously advocate for their clients may <em>require </em>them to hire outliers if it would help their client\u2019s case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b622-6\">David E.

Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b623-6\">On June 9, 2004, the Blackwells filed a 22-count complaint against various thimerosal manufacturers, numerous manufacturers of thimerosal-laden products, and BG &amp; E, alleging that mercury contained in their products or emissions caused their son Jamarr\u2019s autism. Wyeth, as the manufacturer of a thimerosal-laden product, was sued for defective design, breach of warranty of fitness for a specific purpose, failure to warn, strict liability, negligence, defect in manufacturing, common law fraud, negligent misrepresentation, fraudulent misrepresentation, fraudulent misrepresentation through another, deceptive trade practices under the Maryland Consumer Protection Act, breach of implied warranties, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and civil battery.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-7\">Wyeth moved to preclude the testimony of five experts offered by the Blackwells under <em>Frye-Reed, </em>arguing that the experts\u2019 theory, that thimerosal caused Jamarr\u2019s autism, and the various methodologies employed in reaching that conclusion, were not generally accepted in the relevant scientific community. Wyeth also alleged that the Blackwells\u2019 experts were not qualified to testify under Maryland Rule 5-702. The Blackwells filed reciprocal motions regarding a number of Wyeth\u2019s experts.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-8\">Between August 18-29, 2007, Judge Stuart R. Berger of the Circuit Court for Baltimore City conducted a <em>Frye-Reed </em>hearing on these motions,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> wherein testimony was adduced <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>from each of the Blackwells\u2019 experts \u2014 Mark Geier, M.D., Ph.D.; Stephen Siebert, M.D., M.P.H.; Elisabeth Mumper, M.D.; Richard Carlton Deth, Ph.D.; and Boyd Haley, Ph.D.\u2014 and from Wyeth\u2019s five proposed experts \u2014 Peter M. Layde, M.D., M.Sc, Paul Kostyniak, Ph.D., Joseph Buxbaum, Ph.D., Kwame Anane-Yeboa, M.D., \u00e1nd Bryna Siegel, Ph.D. (of whom only Drs. Yeboa and Buxbaum were challenged by the Blackwells). In an order supported by an extensive memorandum opinion, Judge Berger granted Wyeth\u2019s Motion to Preclude Testimony of Plaintiffs Expert Witnesses, pursuant to <em>Frye-Reed </em>and Maryland' Rule 5-702, and denied the Black-wells\u2019 Motion to Exclude Certain Defense Experts and Certain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>Expert Testimony. Thereafter, Judge Berger granted Wyeth\u2019s motion for summary judgment, finding \u201cno genuine dispute as to any material fact.\u201d The Blackwells noted an appeal to the Court of Special Appeals, and this Court granted certiorari prior to any proceedings in the intermediate appellate court, to address the exclusion of the Blackwells\u2019 experts\u2019 testimony.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b625-5\">III. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b625-6\">Before us, the Blackwells argue that the Judge erred in his <em>Frye-Reed </em>analysis, because he denied the admissibility of their experts\u2019 theory, that thimerosal in the vaccines produced by Wyeth and administered to their son, Jamarr, caused his autism, because it was not generally accepted in the relevant scientific community,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> and because their experts were not qualified to testify about a causal relationship between thimerosal and autism, under Maryland Rule 5-702. The Blackwells argue, in essence, that the trial judge impermissibly determined the element of causation on summary judgment and precluded the jury from appropriate fact-finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>Wyeth argues that the trial judge properly precluded the testimony of the Blackwells\u2019 experts, because they were not qualified under Rule 5-702 and because their conclusions and analyses were not accepted in the relevant scientific community-</p>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">A. <em>Frye-Reed </em>Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b626-6\">The essence of the instant case is the application of the <em>Frye-Reed </em>test to the analysis undertaken by an expert where the underlying data and methods for gathering this data are generally accepted in the scientific community but applied to support a novel theory. In reaching his ultimate conclusion that \u201cthe plaintiffs ... failed in their burden of proving that the bases of the expert witnesses\u2019 testimony are generally accepted as reliable within the relevant scientific field,\u201d Judge Berger discussed the importance of the threshold determination with which he was vested. He noted that \u201c[ujnder <em>Reed, </em>the proponent of an expert witness bears the burden of proving the basis of the witness\u2019 opinion is generally accepted as reliable within the relevant scientific field.\u201d He also observed that the <em>Frye-Reed </em>test \u201c \u2018was deliberately intended to interpose a substantial obstacle to the unrestrained admission of evidence based upon new scientific principles,\u2019 \u201d quoting <em>Chesson, </em>399 Md. at 328, 923 A.2d at 946, in turn quoting <em>Reed, </em>283 Md. at 386, 391 A.2d at 370, that the test posed a minimum threshold for the admissibility of scientific evidence in Maryland, and that trial courts continued to retain discretion to exclude such testimony on other grounds \u2014 such as lack of helpfulness or expert qualification.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-7\">In discerning the factual predicates developed during the hearing, which have not been challenged for clear error,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Judge Berger found that \u201c[tjhimerosal is an organic mercury-based compound,\u201d that has been used in \u201cvarious vaccines and other biological and pharmaceutical products since the 1930\u2019s,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>and that it was undisputed that Jamarr had received a diphtheria tetanus and whole-cell pertussis vaccine (\u201cDTP\u201d), at 2 months, 4 months, 6 months and 18 months, pursuant to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s published recommended schedule, as well as a hemophilia influenza type b (\u201cHib\u201d) vaccine. According to Judge Beger, \u201c[b]oth the DTP vaccine and the Hib vaccine contained 50 micrograms of thimerosal, which results in approximately 25 micrograms of mercury in each vaccination.\u201d Judge Berger also found that \u201c[i]n July of 1999, the Public Health Service and the American Academy of Pediatrics issued a joint statement recommending the removal of thimerosal from vaccines\u201d as a precautionary measure, and that \u201c[b]y March of 2001, all vaccines on the recommended childhood immunization schedule were available without thimerosal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b627-4\">Turning to the issue of Jamarr\u2019s developmental challenges, Judge Berger found that, \u201cautism or autism spectrum disorder (\u201cASD\u201d) are pervasive developmental disorders that are characterized by sustained impairments in social interaction, sustained impairments in verbal and nonverbal communication skills, and restricted, repetitive and stereotyped patterns of behaviors or interests,\u201d and that \u201c[u]nder the American Psychiatric Association\u2019s Diagnostic and Statistical Manual ... the onset of autistic disorder is prior to three years of age.\u201d His review of the scientific literature regarding autism\u2019s causes, and in particular, the findings of the National Academy of Sciences\u2019 Institute of Medicine\u2019s (hereinafter \u201cIOM\u201d) 2001 and 2004 Committees,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> led him to note that the 2001 IOM Committee, which was tasked with evaluating \u201cthe alleged connection between thimerosal-containing vaccines and a broad range of neurodevelopmental disorders including autism, ADHD, and speech or language delay,\u201d concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>The hypothesis that thimerosal exposure through the recommended childhood immunization schedule has caused neurodevelopmental disorders is not supported by clinical or experimental evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-5\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-6\">[T]he evidence is inadequate to accept or reject a causal relationship between thimerosal exposures from childhood vaccines and the neurodevelopmental disorders of autism, ADHD, and speech and language delay.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b628-7\">These conclusions were founded upon the following bases:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-8\">(a) low-dose thimerosal exposure in humans has not been demonstrated to be associated with effects on the nervous system;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-9\">(b) neurodevelopmental effects have been demonstrated for prenatal but not postnatal exposures to low doses of ethyl-mercury;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-10\">(c) the toxicological information regarding ethylmercury, particularly at low doses, is limited;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-11\">(d) thimerosal exposure from vaccines has not proven to result in mercury levels associated with toxic responses;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-12\">(e) signs and symptoms of mercury poisonings are not identical to autism, ADHD, or speech or language delay;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-13\">(f) autism is thought primarily to originate from prenatal injury; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-14\">(g) there is no evidence that ethylmercury causes any of the pathophysiological changes known to be associated with autism, such as genetic defects, and there are no well-developed pathological markers of ADHD or delay of speech or language that could be compared to effects of ethylmercury on the nervous system.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b628-15\">The 2001 IOM Committee Report was succeeded in 2004 by another IOM Committee, which, Judge Berger found, again attempted to assess whether a causal link between the administration of thimerosal and autism had been proven in the scientific community. To assess causality, \u201cthe 2004 IOM <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>Committee used the categories of causal conclusions developed by previous IOM committees, namely: (1) no evidence; (2) evidence is inadequate to accept or reject a causal relationship; (3) evidence favors rejection of a causal relationship; (4) evidence favors acceptance of a causal relationship; (5) evidence establishes a causal relationship,\u201d according to Judge Berger\u2019s review. In that context, he continued, the 2004 Committee reviewed a vast body of literature on the subject and considered extensive presentations and submissions made by scientists during an open scientific meeting, ultimately concluding, \u201cthat the evidence favors rejection of a causal relationship between thimerosal-containing vaccines and autism.\u201d This rejection, Judge Berger found, was in large part, based on \u201c[ejpidemiological studies examining [thimerosal] and autism, including three controlled observation studies (Hviid et al., 2003; Miller, 2004; Verstraeten, et al., 2003) and two uncontrolled observational studies (Madsen, et al, 2003; Stehr-Green, et al., 2003),\u201d all of which, \u201cconsistently provided evidence of no association between [thimerosal] and autism, despite the fact that these studies utilized different methods and examined different populations (in Sweden, Denmark, the United States and the United Kingdom).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b629-5\">As Judge Berger found, the 2004 IOM Committee ultimately determined that the link between thimerosal and autism was largely speculative:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b629-6\">In the absence of experimental or human evidence that vaccination (either the MMR vaccine or the preservative thimerosal) affects metabolic, developmental, immune or other physiological or molecular mechanisms that are causally related to the development of autism, the committee concludes that the hypotheses generated to date are theoretical only.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b629-7\">Given the lack of direct evidence for a biological mechanism and the fact that all well-designed epidemiological studies provide evidence of no association between thimerosal and autism, the committee recommends that cost-benefit assess<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>ments regarding the use of thimerosal-containing versus thimerosal-free vaccines and other biological or pharmaceutical products, whether in the United States or other countries, should not include autism as a potential risk.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b630-5\">Judge Berger also acknowledged that a \u201cplethora of venerable publications reject[ ] the plaintiffs\u2019 theoretical link between thimerosal-containing vaccines and autism,\u201d including the Global Advisory Committee on Vaccine Safety, which advises the World Health Organization on health related issues, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the American Academy of Pediatrics, and the National Institutes of Health, all of which have taken the position that thimerosal vaccines do not cause or contribute to autism. He stated that epidemiology, or \u201cthe science that studies the distribution of diseases within populations,\u201d was the \u201csingle most relevant field of science to the general causation issue presented in this case, i.e., whether thimerosal-containing vaccines can cause autism,\u201d and recognized that none of the Blackwells\u2019 experts was qualified as an expert in epidemiology.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-6\">Turning to the opinions rendered by the Blackwells\u2019 primary expert,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Dr. Mark Geier, Judge Berger looked first at Dr. Geier\u2019s analytical framework, whereby he purported to have completed an epidemiological analysis on scientifically accepted data compiled in various third-party databases: the Vaccine Adverse Effect Reporting System (VAERS), the Vaccine Safety Datalink, the Department of Education database, and the California Department of Social Services database. He then subjected Dr. Geier\u2019s conclusion, that thimerosal in vaccines causes autism in a small number of genetically susceptible individuals, to <em>Frye-Reed, </em>scrutiny.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-7\">Judge Berger began by observing that the <em>only </em>published epidemiological studies purporting to show a causal link between thimerosal-containing vaccines and autism were the studies undertaken by Dr. Mark Geier and his son, Dr. David <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>Geier, which suggested that the VAERS database could be extrapolated to show a causal connection between thimerosal and autism. He recognized the distinction between the use of data that is scientifically accepted and analysis purportedly based on that data, when the analysis employed is inappropriate to the data produced, which is dependent on the context in which it was produced and the hypothesis under scrutiny:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Anj\">It is significant to this Court that the 10M Committee criticized the technique utilized in Lone of the Geier studies] ... expressly noting that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-5\">VAERS cannot be used to calculate incidence rates because the VAERS database does not have complete reporting of all adverse events and because many report events lack a confirmed diagnosis or confirmed attribution to vaccine.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-6\">Admittedly, Dr. Geier acknowledged that [this study] is controversial. Indeed, the American Academy of Pediatrics (\u201cAAP\u201d), in a May, 2003 posting to their website, strongly denounced the Geier and Geier publication ... stating:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A1K\">This paper uses data from the [VAERS] inappropriately and contains numerous conceptual and scientific flaws, omissions of fact, inaccuracies, and misstatements .... failfing] to acknowledge the inherent limitations of the VAERS database when drawing conclusions of adverse event associations ... [and] [comparing the occurrence of late onset, chronic conditions like autism by using acute vaccine reactions like fever, pain and vomiting (presumably attributable to other vaccine components) as controls makes no sense as a measure of relative adverse event rates.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-7\">Dr. Geier presented several additional publications that also contained studies in which the Geiers compared adverse event reports filed with VAERS with regard to thimerosalcontaining and thimerosal-free vaccines. In each of the studies, Geier and Geier continued assigning (despite the absence of total mercury exposive data), a higher cumulative thimerosal total to one group of children (those who filed a VAERS report regarding a TCV) than the other group <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>(those who filed a VAERS report regarding a thimerosalfree vaccine.) As a result, Geier and Geier concluded that the greater the total exposure to mercury from thimerosal, the greater the risk of neurological disorders. Critically, with regard to the pre-2004 published Geier and Geier VAERS database studies, the [IOM] opined:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-5\">(1) [t]he three studies have <em>serious methodological limitations </em>that make their results uninterpretable;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-6\">(2) [t]he results of their studies are likewise improbable;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-7\">(3) [t]he articles also lack a complete and transparent description of their methods and underlying data, making it difficult to confirm or evaluate their findings.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-8\">Accordingly, the 2004 IOM Committee concluded that the Geier and Geier VAERS studies were not helpful with regard to the causation issue it considered, that is, whether thimerosal-containing vaccines can cause autism or autistic spectrum disorders. The 2004 IOM Committee Report concluded:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-9\">As a result of these significant methodological limitations, the committee finds the results of [Geier and Geier\u2019s]' studies to be uninterpretable and, as such, they are noncontributory with respect to causality.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-10\">In addition, Geier and Geier analyzed the VSP database on no less than two occasions. The Geiers presented to the 2004 IOM Committee an unpublished analysis of USD data, but did not describe the basis for their calculation or their methods leading the 2004 IOM Committee to conclude that it \u201cfound the results of their analysis using VSP data uninterpretable, primarily due to the lack of a complete description of their methods.\u201d Finally, the 2004 IOM Report reviewed Geier and Geier\u2019s Department of Education database and found that \u201c[t]hese studies are characterized by serious methodological problems.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b632-11\">Judge Berger concluded that, as a result of flawed analysis of acceptable data, Dr. Geier\u2019s epidemiological studies did not pass scrutiny under <em>Frye-Reed:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b633-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>In sum, the plaintiffs rely on Dr. Geier\u2019s six epidemiological studies that purport to find an association between thimerosal in vaccines and autism. However, <em>this Court finds that Dr. Geier\u2019s epidemiological studies do not constitute generally accepted bases for plaintiffs\u2019 causation opinions inasmuch as those studies have been rejected by the 'relevant scientific community due to severe methodological flaws that render them unreliable. Indeed, the venerable IOM Committee concluded that Dr. Geier\u2019s studies were not only flawed metthodologically, but \u201cuninterpretable.\u201d and therefore \u201cnoncont\u00f1butory. </em>\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b633-5\">As a result, this Court finds expressly that Dr. Geier\u2019s epidemiological studies are not generally accepted in the scientific community because they utilize a methodology that is fundamentally flawed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b633-6\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b633-7\">For the purposes of the <em>Frye-Reed </em>test, the \u201crelevant scientific community\u201d includes the full community of scientists with sufficient training and expertise to permit them to comprehend novel scientific methods, and may not properly be restricted to those who practice or otherwise adhere to the methods at issue. <em>Reed, v.

Moreover, other organizations have issued statements that comport with the comprehensive analysis supplied in the 2004 IOM Committee Report.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-4\"><em>It is well established that where an expert witness offers a novel medical theory of causation, the bases of the expert\u2019s opinion, including the theory of causation, and the methodologies, must all be generally accepted or reliable in the relevant scientific community.

This Court finds that it is generally accepted in the relevant scientific community that autism is genetic in origin except in rare instances of prenatal exposures to certain substances at defined periods during pregnancy. Further, for the reasons explicated in this Memorandum Opinion, this Court notes that it is generally accepted in the relevant scientific community that thimerosal in vaccines does not cause or contribute to neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism.

Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc., </em>959 F.2d 1349, 1360-61 (6th Cir.1992) (When \u201c[t]he analytical gap between the evidence presented and the inferences to be drawn on the ultimate issue of human birth defects is too wide .... a jury should not be asked to speculate on the issue of causation.\u201d). In calling attention to the \u201canalytical gap\u201d between existing data and the opinion proffered by an expert, the Court admonished against reliance solely on an expert\u2019s word that his conclusion is appropriate to the underlying data and methods. <em>Id. </em>This concept of \u201canalytical gap\u201d had been employed by federal courts before <em>Joiner, see Lust v.

In <em>Goeb v. Tharaldson, </em>615 N.W.2d 800, 816 (Minn.2000), for example, the Minnesota Supreme Court upheld the exclusion of export testimony because the methodology was unreliable and the conclusions proffered exhibited \u201ctoo great a leap\u201d from the data gathered. The Goebs had sued a pesticide applicator, Tharaldson, and Dow Chemical, the manufacturer, alleging <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>that exposure to the insecticide Dursaban, after it was sprayed in the house into which they were moving, caused injury to them and their child. The Goebs offered the testimony of two experts, both of whom would have testified, based on the Goebs\u2019 medical records referring to adverse health affects, as well as on the toxic levels of the chemical chlorpyifos in their bodies,<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> that the Goebs were suffering from organophosphate<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> poisoning caused by their exposure to Dursaban. <em>Id. </em>at 806-08. Dow had argued that the experts\u2019 conclusion should be excluded under <em>Frye </em>because the Goebs\u2019 level of exposure was not factored into their analysis. After the expert testimony was excluded, the Goebs sought review, arguing that the experts\u2019 testimony had been based upon generally accepted methodologies. The court affirmed, accepting the contention that the experts had used generally accepted methods in completing their tests, but rejecting the experts\u2019 analysis when affirming the trial judge\u2019s conclusion \u201cthat [the expert] made too great a leap to get from \u2018mere exposure of an unquantified amount of Dursban\u2019 to his conclusions about appellants\u2019 illnesses.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 816. <em>See also Kane v.

According to Judge Berger\u2019s findings, this hypothesis was apparently inspired by statements made in the 2001 and 2004 IOM Report \u2014 that a link is \u201cbiologically plausible,\u201d and that it is well settled that even a large well-designed epidemiological study might fail to detect \u201cthe possibility that vaccines contribute to autism in some small subset of cases or very unusual circumstances.\u201d Two predicates of Dr. Geier\u2019s alternative theory are that (1) autism is associated with certain genes \u2014 the A1298C polymorphism in the MTHFR gene, the null polymorphism of the GSTMI gene, the II05V polymorphism of the GSTPI gene, the 1114T, R197Q, and K268R polymorphisms in the NATZ gene, and an unspecified variant in the CYP3A4 gene; and (2) based on a differential diagnoses analysis,<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Jamarr\u2019s neurological disorders were caused or exacerbated by his exposure to thimerosal because of his genetic susceptibility. We shall first address Judge Berger\u2019s factual findings with respect to these predicates, as well as the Blackwells\u2019 challenges thereto, under the clear error standard,<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> and then shall evaluate de novo Judge Berger\u2019s ultimate conclusion \u2014 that neither the genetic susceptibility theory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>nor the tests used to determine if Jamarr\u2019s autism was due to genetic susceptibility were generally accepted in the relevant scientific field. <em>See Wilson, </em>370 Md. at 201-02 n. 5, 803 A.2d at 1040 n. 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-5\">In rejecting the association of autism with certain gene polymorphisms identified by Dr. Geier, Judge Berger found that, although \u201c[t]he 2004 IOM Committee found that a genetic susceptibility could indeed constitute a \u2018theoretical explanation\u2019 for the fact that reliable epidemiological studies have not found any association between thimerosal exposure and autism,\u201d it, nevertheless, \u201cfound no corroborating data in the laboratory, in animals, or in humans, linking vaccines or vaccine components for autism based on genetic susceptibility.\u201d He also found that \u201cthere is no evidence that the presence of these polymorphisms impairs the body\u2019s ability to excrete mercury.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b642-6\">During oral argument before us, the Blackwells\u2019 attorney specifically challenged Judge Berger\u2019s generalized factual finding, \u201cthat there is no evidence that any of the polymophisms identified by Dr. Geier are associated with autism,\u201d arguing that the Blackwells submitted three studies that provided such evidence: Steven Buyske, et al., <em>Analysis of Case-Parent Trios at a Locus with a Deletion Allele: Association of GSTMl with Autism, </em>7 BMC Genetics, Feb. 2006, at 1-16; G.A. Westphal, et al., <em>Homozygous Gene Deletions of the Glutathione S-Transferases M1 and T1 Are Associated with Thimerosal Sensitization, </em>73 Inter.

Jill James, et al., <em>Metabolic Endophenotype and Related Genotypes Are Associated with Oxidative Stress in Children With Autism, </em>26 Am. J. of Med. Genetics 947, May 2006, at 947-56. Judge Berger made the contested statement in the following paragraph where he discussed his general findings with respect to Dr. Geier\u2019s identified polymorphisms:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b642-7\">Autism is likely to involve multiple genes. Dr. Geier testified that the following genes are associated with autism: the A1298C polymorphism in the MTHFR gene; the null polymorphism of the GSTMl gene; the 1105V polymorphism of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>the GSTPI gene; the 1114T, R197Q, and K268R polymorphisms in the NATZ gene; and an unspecified variant in the CYP3A4 gene. There is no evidence that any of the polymorphisms identified by Dr. Geier are associated with autism. None of the polymorphisms is generally accepted among clinical geneticists to be causes of autism. Further, despite the theories advanced by Dr. Geier, there is no evidence that the presence of these polymorphisms impairs the body\u2019s ability to excrete mercury.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b643-4\">Judge Berger subsequently supported these general findings with specific findings: first, he found that \u201cthere is no evidence that the A1298C polymorphism in the MTHFR gene is associated with autism,\u201d based on \u201c[a] 2004 study by Boris, et al., and a follow-up study by one of the co-authors of that 2004 study, Jill James (among others), both showed no statistically significant association between the MTHFR 1298A/C polymorphism and autism.\u201d <em>See </em>Marvin Boris et al., <em>Association of MTHFR Gene Vanants with Autism, </em>9 J. of Am. Physicians and Surgeons, Winter 2004, at 106, 107; James, <em>supra </em>at 951. Judge Berger next found that \u201cit is well established that common genetic polymorphisms that vary across ethnic groups, such as the MTHFR 1298A/C polymorphism, are not considered by geneticists to be candidates for causation of a disease, such as autism, that has equal prevalence among ethnic groups,\u201d observing that the MTHFR 1298A/C polymorphism exhibited this variance according to a Single Nucleotide Polymorphism Cluster Report database.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Judge Berger then addressed Dr. Geier\u2019s identification of the null polymorphism, finding:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b643-5\">The GSTMI null polymorphism refers to a condition in which the GSTMI gene is missing. The purported association between the GSTMI polymorphism and autism has been investigated and rejected in several studies. No study has found an association between the GSTMI null polymor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>phism and autism. Further, there is no evidence that the absence of the GSTMI gene is associated with autism.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AqT\">He based this determination primarily on studies by James, <em>supra, </em>at 947-56, and Buyske, <em>supra, </em>at 1-16.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-6\">The existence of articles from Buyske, Westphal and James, proffered by the Blackwells, do not contradict, with any significance, Judge Berger\u2019s specific factual findings: Buyske\u2019s article, <em>Analysis of Case-Parent Trios at a Locus with a Deletion Allele: Association of GSTMI with Autism, </em>defines what he considers to be the appropriate methodology to test for a possible association of a specific genotype with autism. Buyske, supra, at 1. Westphal\u2019s article, <em>Homozygous Gene Deletions of the Glutathione S-Transferases Ml and T1 are Associated with Thimerosal Sensitization, </em>discusses a study that he conducted, in which he tested allergic reactions to thimerosal in men and women over the age of 38, none of whom was identified as autistic; autism was not being studied.Westphal, supra, at 385. The James article, <em>Metabolic Endophenotype and Related Genotypes are Associated with Oxidative Stress in Children With Autism, </em>recognized its own limitation, \u201c[gjiven the relatively small number of cases and controls in the present study,\u201d and suggested that \u201cabnormal metabolic profile observed in a significant proportion of autistic children suggests the provocative possibility that some autistic behaviors could be a neurologic manifestation of a genetically based <em>systemic </em>metabolic derangement.\u201d James, <em>supra, </em>at 954 (italics in original). Clearly, this article suggests a hypothesis for further testing \u2014 a hypothesis which does not bear on any purported relationship between thimerosal and autism. Judge Berger supported his general finding that there was, \u201cno evidence that any of the polymorphisms identified by Dr. Geier are associated with autism,\u201d with articles specifically addressing polymorphisms identified by Geier; he did not err in his finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-7\">In rejecting the methodology utilized by Dr. Geier of differential diagnosis to arrive at a genetic susceptibility thesis, Judge Berger recognized that \u201cdifferential diagnosis is a methodology by which the cause of a medical problem is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>identified by considering and then ruling out the potential causes until the most probable cause remains.\u201d According to Judge Berger, Dr. Geier had performed urinary porphyrin,<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> mercury toxicity, testosterone and genetic polymorphism<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> tests, but that none of them is \u201cgenerally accepted by the medical community, including clinical geneticists and pediatricians, as appropriate tests for either the work-up of a patient with autism or to determine the underlying cause of autism.\u201d Noting as well that Dr. Geier\u2019s differential diagnosis methodology \u201cfail[ed] to even consider the single most important alleged cause of autism\u201d \u2014 unknown genetics \u2014 Judge Berger concluded that \u201ccausation opinions on the etiology of autism cannot be based on a differential diagnosis that includes thimerosal as a potential cause of autism because the science does not support the plaintiffs\u2019 purported theory of a causal connection between thimerosal-containing vaccines and autism\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-5\">Further, Dr. Geier performed a differential diagnosis in this proceeding. It is generally accepted in the relevant scienti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>fic community that differential diagnosis is a methodology by which the cause of a medical problem is identified [by] considering and then ruling out the potential causes until the most probable cause remains. It is well settled that \u201c[generally, it is not appropriate to rely on a differential diagnosis to prove general causation.\u201d <em>See Doe v.

Indeed, \u201c[a] differential diagnosis that fails to take serious account of other potential causes may be so lacking that it cannot provide a reliable basis for an opinion.\u201d <em>Doe v.

It is noteworthy that other courts have acknowledged that Dr. Geier\u2019s methodology of differential diagnosis is fundamentally flawed, because he improperly \u201crules in\u201d thimerosal as a potential cause of autism, and he cannot rule out the high likelihood that autism in any given individual was caused purely by genetic factors that do not require an environmental trigger. <em>See e.g. Doe v.

The Blackwells assert that Dr. Geier considered genetics and genetic interactions, but that, according to Dr. Geier, unknown genetics account for less than 5% of autism cases, and he need not discount all possible causes.

A strong genetic component clearly exists.... As yet a biological marker specific for autism has not been defined. It is possible that Autism encompasses a spectrum of disease subtypes that have different etiologies.\u201d), as well as other articles proffered to Judge Berger by both the Blackwells and Wyeth. <em>See, e.g., </em>Boris, <em>supra, </em>at 106-07 (\u201cAutism is a complex neurodevelopment disorder with numerous possible genetic and environmental influences....

Judge Berger did not err in finding that \u201ca gene or series of interacting genes that have not yet been identified\u201d is the \u201cmost prevalent alleged cause of autism,\u201d based upon our review of the record. We agree that Dr. Geier did not sufficiently consider genetics in his differential diagnosis equation. This conclusion is similar to that reached in <em>Wilson, </em>in which we recognized that the State\u2019s expert, in applying the product rule, did not account for a genetic linkage between siblings, who may have died of SIDS, rather than been murdered by their father.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-5\">Based on Judge Berger\u2019s rejection of Dr. Geier\u2019s underlying hypothesis and methodology, i.e. the identification of specific <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>genes and differential diagnosis, we hold that Judge Berger\u2019s ultimate determination \u2014 that Dr. Geier\u2019s genetic susceptibility theory is no more than hypothesis and conjecture, devoid of a generally accepted methodology to support it \u2014 should not be disturbed by us.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-4\">B.

Co. v. </em>Messenger[, 181 Md. 295, 29 A.2d 653 (1948) ], wherein it is stated:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b649-5\">It is a familiar rule of evidence that a witness, in order to qualify as an expert, should have such special knowledge of the subject on which he is to testify that he can give the jury assistance in solving a problem for which their equipment of average knowledge is inadequate. It is sufficient if the court is satisfied that the expert has in some way gained such experience in the matter as would entitle his evidence to credit. It is not a ground for excluding the testimony of an expert that he bases his statements in whole or in part upon what he has read, provided that his reading can be assumed to constitute part of his general knowledge adequate to enable him to form a reasonable opinion of his own. <em>A 'witness is qualified to testify as an expert ivhen he exhibits such a degree of knowledge as to make it appear that his opinion is of some value, whether such knowledge has been gained from observation or experience, standard books, maps of recognized authority, or any other reliable sources. </em>The knowledge of an expert in any science or art would be extremely limited if it extended no further than inferences from happenings within his own experience. His testimony is admitted because it is based on his special knowledge derived not only from his own experience, but also from the experiments and reasoning of others, communicated by personal association or through books or other sources.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b649-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 169-70, 367 A.2d at 474 (emphasis added) (internal citations omitted). Because <em>Rodman </em>was a medical malpractice case, we also opined regarding specialized qualifications of medical experts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b649-7\">In light of the fact that we have never treated expert medical testimony any differently than other types of expert testimony, <em>see Crews v.

Wyeth, having addressed the experts\u2019 credentials during <em>voir dire, </em>reasserts that the Blackwells\u2019 experts lack the necessary knowledge, expertise, training or education to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>offer an opinion about a causal relationship between thimerosal and autism. Although we agree with the Blackwells that generally there is \u201cno reason why a person who has acquired sufficient knowledge in an area should be disqualified as a medical expert merely because he is not a specialist or merely because he has never personally performed a particular procedure,\u201d we cannot say, in this case, that Judge Berger abused his discretion by adhering to \u201cartificial classifications\u201d of a specialty\u2019s title, without concern for \u201cthe witness\u2019 knowledge\u201d and ability to convey valuable information to jurors. <em>See Rodman </em>279 Md. at 172, 367 A.2d at 475.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-4\"><em>Deese v.

Quoting <em>Sippio v.

State, </em>349 Md. 834, 709 A.2d 1316 (1998), another case relied upon by the Blackwells, we addressed an expert\u2019s qualification in the area of forensics. Massie had been convicted of murder and argued that the trial judge abused his discretion in permitting a forensics police investigator, who was not a doctor of medicine, to testify that the victim had been dead for as long as five hours, or \u201cfrom 11:15 a.m. at the earliest.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 838, 709 A.2d at 1317. The trial judge admitted the testimony, finding that although the investigator was not a pathologist, he had substantial experience in the area of forensic science, taught courses in the area, and was present at the scene to collect evidence and examine the victim\u2019s body. We affirmed, noting that \u201c[t]ime of death is a subject which courts have long recognized as an appropriate one for expert testimony,\u201d and that \u201c[i]n the instant matter [the expert\u2019s] examination of the deceased\u2019s body gave him a sufficient factual basis to support opinion testimony,\u201d so that the expert, \u201cby virtue of his experience, training, and education, had special knowledge on the subject beyond the experience of the jurors and that [the] opinion would assist the jury.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 851, 709 A.2d at 1324.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-6\">Further, in <em>In re: Yve S., </em>373 Md. 551, 819 A.2d 1030 (2003), we addressed when a witness is not qualified. In that case, a mother had challenged a determination by the Montgomery County Department of Health and Human Services \u2014 changing her 12-year-old daughter\u2019s permanency plan from reunification with the mother to permanent foster care \u2014 presenting a judge of the Circuit Court for Montgomery County with the question of whether \u201cthe mother\u2019s mental illness had stabilized to the point where she could take care of her daughter properly ... [and whether] neglect [would] be repeated.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 613-14, 819 A.2d at 1067. During the review hearing, the judge permitted, over the mother\u2019s objection, the testimony of a social worker, who opined that the mother appeared to relapse into another manic episode during trial and that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>although the mother had done \u201can amazing job in the last two years\u201d of stabilizing herself, the pressure of caring for Yve S., who had special needs, would cause her to relapse, such that a placement with the mother would not last. <em>Id. </em>at 615, 819 A.2d at 1068. The trial judge, thereafter, entered an order establishing permanent foster care as the goal of the permanency plan, and the Court of Special Appeals affirmed; we granted certiorari, in part, to address whether the admission of the social worker\u2019s opinion was prejudicial error. In reversing and remanding, we held that the circuit court judge erred by admitting the social worker\u2019s testimony, because she was not qualified to make a \u201ccomplex\u201d medical diagnosis of mental illness nor to speculate as to the mother\u2019s future ability to control her illness:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b653-5\">These statements [by the social worker] are not only speculative, but amount to a lay diagnosis or prognosis regarding a complex medical issue. [The social worker] is not qualified to do that, as she was not qualified as a psychiatrist, psychologist, or licensed clinical social worker. The testimony was improper and should have been stricken.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b653-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 615-16, 819 A.2d at 1068. Hence, when \u201ccomplex medical issue[s]\u201d or diagnoses are in question, we have required a specificity of knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education for qualification.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-7\">With this in mind, we turn to Judge Berger\u2019s findings and determinations regarding the Blackwells\u2019 experts. Judge Berger initially found that the field of epidemiology was the \u201csingle most relevant field of science to the general causation issue presented in this case, i.e., whether thimerosal-containing vaccines can cause autism,\u201d and also found that, \u201c[a]fter reviewing the testimony and evidence, this Court finds that the fields of epidemiology, toxicology and genetics are central to many of the issues in this cause, including the causation issues that have been presented in this proceeding,\u201d<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> on the following basis:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b654-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>Epidemiology is the science that studies the distribution of diseases within populations and determines diseases in populations. Accordingly, medical causality is central to the field of epidemiology. It is the finding of this Court that epidemiology is the single most relevant field of science to the general causation issue presented in this case, i.e., whether thimerosal-containing vaccines can cause autism. The 2004 IOM Report specifically notes that \u201c[ejpidemiologic studies carry the most weight in a causality assessment.\u201d That is so because in epidemiology, an association between an exposure and a health outcome generally occurs more frequently in people with one type of exposure than in those who do not have the exposure. This is not to suggest that one must be an epidemiologist or rely on epidemiological studies to testify on the issues associated with this proceeding. However, it is significant to note that Drs. Haley, Deth, Mumper and Siebert are not epidemiologists, and were not proffered to the Court that they were qualified in the field of epidemiology. Plaintiffs proffered Dr. Mark Geier as their lone expert witness in the field of epidemiology-</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b654-5\">When specifically addressing the credentials of the Blackwells\u2019 five experts, Judge Berger also made the following findings regarding the experts\u2019 lack of qualification to conduct epidemiological, toxicological and genetic empirical research:</p>\n<p id=\"b654-6\">\n<em>Dr. Mark Geier</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b654-7\">With respect to Dr. Geier, Judge Berger found that, in addition to being a board-certified genetic counselor, he had been proffered as an expert in genetics, \u201cvaccine injuries,\u201d \u201cdifferential etiology of autism,\u201d \u201cmercury toxicity,\u201d medicine, \u201curinary porphyrin analysis\u201d and epidemiology; that he \u201cis not an epidemiologist or toxicologist,\u201d with no degree or board certification in either field, and that nothing regarding \u201chis knowledge, skill, training, experience, or education\u201d made him <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>qualified to testify under Maryland Rule 5-702: \u201cDr. Geier\u2019s credentials as a medical doctor and a genetic counselor are not a foundation sufficient for him to offer an opinion that thimerosal-containing vaccines cause autism.\u201d Judge Berger also noted that, in at least one federal case, Dr. Geier had been deemed unqualified to testify as an expert regarding the impact of the administration of thimerosal. <em>See, e.g., Redfoot v. B.F. Ascher &amp; Co., </em>2007 WL 1593239, *11-12, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 40002, *36-37 (N.D.Cal.2007) (excluding the testimony of Dr. Geier under Federal Rule 702 in a case where he was proffered to testify that the Ayr Saline Nasal Mist was defective in design because it contained thimerosal, which may have caused the plaintiffs\u2019 child\u2019s autism).</p>\n<p id=\"b655-5\">\n<em>Dr. Boyd Haley</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b655-6\">Judge Berger found that Dr. Haley is a Professor of Chemistry at the University of Kentucky at Lexington, that he was offered by the Blackwells as an expert in the fields of mercury toxicity, biochemistry and physiology, and that he was qualified in the areas of biochemistry and physiology by virtue of his knowledge, skill, experience, training and education. Judge Berger acknowledged, based in part on Dr. Haley\u2019s approximately 130 articles on neuro-degeneration caused by mercury, that Dr. Haley was well-qualified to testify as to the general toxicity of mercury in human brain cells, but that he was not qualified to testify whether the administration of a vaccine containing thimerosal results in the exposure of a child\u2019s brain to mercury, whether autistic children metabolize and excrete mercury the way other children are able to, or whether thimerosal in childhood vaccines causes neurological damage in genetically susceptible children.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-7\">\n<em>Dr. Richard Deth</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b655-8\">Judge Berger found that \u201cDr. Deth teaches pharmacology at Northeastern University,\u201d that \u201che was offered by the [Blackwells] as an expert in the areas of physiology, neuropharmacology and the effects of thimerosal in the human brain,\u201d and that Dr. Deth was \u201cclearly qualified to testify as an expert witness in the areas of physiology and neurophar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>macology.\u201d Judge Berger, however, excluded Dr. Deth\u2019s testimony, because although he was qualified in these fields, his opinion \u201cthat exposure to mercury for thimerosal-containing vaccines causes autism,\u201d would have required him to delve into fields of toxicology, epidemiology, neurology and genetics \u2014 all fields with which he had little or no expertise.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-5\">\n<em>Dr. Elizabeth Mumper</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b656-6\">With respect to Dr. Mumper, Judge Berger found that she is a general pediatrician in private practice in Virginia, that the Blackwells proffered her \u201cas an expert in the fields of pediatrics, in the diagnosis and treatment of children with neurodevelopmental disorders, including Attention Deficit Disorder, learning disabilities and autism, and as an expert clinician in the field of diagnosing children with mercury toxicity, and treating children with mercury toxicity.\u201d Although Dr. Mumper was qualified to testify regarding the diagnosis and treatment of children with neurodevelopmental disorders, Judge Berger determined that her experience was not relevant to the ability to assess the underlying cause of these conditions. Specifically, Judge Berger iterated, as he did when discussing Dr. Deth, that qualification to testify to causation would involve some expertise, knowledge or skill in the areas of epidemiology, toxicology or genetics.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-7\">\n<em>Dr. Stephen Siebert</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b656-8\">Judge Berger found that Dr. Siebert, who has a master\u2019s degree in public health and is board certified in the field df psychiatry, was qualified to testify in the fields of psychiatry and forensic psychiatry. As with the other experts of the Blackwells, however, Judge Berger found that Dr. Siebert\u2019s board certifications bore no relevance to the \u201cappropriate basis for opinion testimony on the issue of whether thimerosalcontaining vaccines can cause autism.\u201d Further, Judge Berger noted that, although Dr. Siebert was well-qualified to . testify to his diagnosis of Jamarr Blackwell as mentally retarded and autistic, he did not possess the expertise to testify regarding the causes of Jamarr\u2019s autism by nature of his knowledge and experience.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>In this case, Judge Berger did not receive Dr. Geier, as well as the other of the Blackwells\u2019 experts, as qualified to testify regarding causation because they were not qualified in the field of epidemiology, which he determined to be central to the Blackwells\u2019 claims. Although we recognize that Judge Berger excluded Dr. Geier\u2019s testimony under the third prong of Maryland Rule 5-702, which requires \u201ca sufficient factual basis [to] exist[ ] to support the expert testimony,\u201d and the <em>Fnje-Reed </em>analysis, we, nevertheless, address Dr. Geier\u2019s credentials along with the four other experts, because <em>voir dire </em>of an expert is normally the threshold issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-5\">We have not had occasion to review the exclusion of witnesses based on <em>voir dire </em>of their credentials in a case where a complex and novel theory of science has been postulated. In <em>Massie </em>and <em>Deese, </em>we addressed expert specialization in the context of an expert\u2019s ability to execute a previously acceptable technique for determining the time or manner of death. In <em>Radman, </em>we held that an expert need not be specialized in a precise field where negligence had been alleged in order to opine about deviation from the standard of care. In each instance, we rebuffed challenges based on specialization in a relevant field, when we were presented with the expert\u2019s ability to perform an <em>accepted </em>technique.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-6\">When a novel theory of science is presented, however, its reliability and validity are dependent not only on the application of generally acceptable methodology and analyses, but also upon the knowledge, skill, experience, training or education of the scientist who purports to utilize them, because the expert must embody expertise in the <em>relevant </em>scientific field to be able to give an opinion regarding the results of the process of scientific discovery. One of our sister states, when confronted with this conundrum under a similar rule governing experts,<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> identified three factors as relevant in defining the minimal level of qualification necessary:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b658-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>Appellate courts may consider several criteria in assessing whether a trial court has clearly abused its discretion in ruling on an expert\u2019s qualifications. First, is the field of expertise complex? The degree of education, training, or experience that a witness should have before he can qualify as an expert is directly related to the complexity of the field about which he proposes to testify. If the expert evidence is close to the jury\u2019s common understanding, the witness\u2019s qualifications are less important than when the evidence is well outside the jury\u2019s own experience. For example, DNA profiling is scientifically complex; latent-print comparison (whether of fingerprints, tires, or shoes) is not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b658-5\">Second, how conclusive is the expert\u2019s opinion? The more conclusive the expert\u2019s opinion, the more important is his degree of expertise. Testimony that \u201ca given profile occurred one time in 2.578 sextillion (2.578 followed by 21 zeroes), a number larger than the number of known stars in the universe (estimated at one sextillion)\u201d requires a much higher degree of scientific expertise than testimony \u201cthat the defendant\u2019s tennis shoe could have made the bloody shoe print found on a piece of paper in the victim\u2019s apartment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b658-6\">And third, how central is the area of expertise to the resolution of the lawsuit? The more dispositive it is of the disputed issues, the more important the expert\u2019s qualifications are. If DNA is the only thing tying the defendant to the crime, the reliability of the expertise and the witness\u2019s qualifications to give his opinion are more crucial than if eyewitnesses and a confession also connect the defendant to the crime.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b659-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number><em>Rodgers v. State, </em>205 S.W.3d 525, 528 (Tex.Crim.App.2006) (footnotes omitted). <em>See Radman v. Harold, </em>279 Md. 167, 171 n. 2, 367 A.2d 472, 475 n. 2 (1977), quoting <em>Baltimore Refrigerating &amp; Heating Co. of Baltimore v. Kreiner, </em>109 Md. 361, 370, 71 A. 1066, 1070 (1909) (\u201c[Ejxpert capacity is a matter wholly relative to the subject of the particular inquiry.\u201d); <em>See also </em>Faigman, <em>supra, </em>at 41, (\u201c[JJust as with [federal] Rule 702 validity assessments, the judge\u2019s gatekeeping obligation should extend not merely to qualifications in the abstract, but qualifications to testify about the subject that is relevant to the issues in dispute.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b659-4\">Although we do not apply the second prong, regarding the conclusiveness of the expert\u2019s opinion, because it would necessitate going to the merits of the expert\u2019s opinion prior to a review of credentials, we do believe that two of the factors are relevant in our analysis \u2014 those being whether the field of expertise is complex and whether the area of expertise is central to the resolution of the lawsuit. In the present case, clearly the level of complexity regarding the establishment of a causal relationship between the administration of a vaccine containing thimerosal and the onset of autism is complex; to the extent that \u201cestablishing\u201d such a conclusion is even possible, it involves the extrapolation from, and scientific review of, numerous studies spanning a gamut of fields and methodologies, and most particularly, available epidemiological studies. As Blackwells\u2019 counsel stated during oral argument before this Court, their experts\u2019 causal conclusions are based on: (1) peer reviewed published epidemiological studies; (2) in vitro studies; (3) toxicological studies; (4) pharmacokinetic<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> studies that discuss the distribution of mercury throughout the body; (5) diagnostic tests of blood \u201cto determine the level of gluthionine in the body, which is a molecule necessary to eliminate mercury\u201d; (6) porphyrin urine analysis to determine mercury toxicity; (7) differential diagnosis; and (8) \u201cextrapolation from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>animal studies and from other in vitro studies.\u201d It is noteworthy also, as the IOM Committee recognized in its 2004 Report, that any conclusion regarding the cause of autism is complicated by the fact that \u201cautism,\u201d itself, is not a single disorder but a <em>\u201cset </em>of developmental disorders characterized by sustained impairments in social interaction [and] communication,\u201d and that \u201cautism,\u201d and \u201cautistic spectrum disorders\u201d refer to a <em>\u201cbroad[] group </em>of pervasive developmental disorders.\u201d IOM Report, at 3-4 (2004) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b660-5\">That the complex field of epidemiology is central to the resolution of the lawsuit, moreover, is not disputed. The Blackwells have never challenged Judge Berger\u2019s finding that epidemiology, primarily, is the relevant field for establishing a causal relationship, nor do they dispute that the establishment of a causal relationship is dispositive to the outcome of the lawsuit. Their contention, rather, is that their experts were qualified to offer conclusions based on epidemiological principles.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-6\">Judge Berger, therefore, did not abuse his discretion when he required a specificity of knowledge, skill, experience, training or education related to the resolution of the lawsuit, and concluded that Drs. Geier\u2019s, Haley\u2019s, Deth\u2019s, Mumper\u2019s and Siebert\u2019s fields of expertise were not relevant to the specific bodies of science that purport to maintain generally acceptable scientific methods and analyses related to autism and its causes. Based upon all of the forgoing analysis, we agree with the well-reasoned and cogent opinion of Judge Berger.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-7\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE CITY AFFIRMED.

Skevofilaxes\u2019 expert conceded, in a deposition taken in connection with a thimerosal case pending elsewhere, that his claim of causation between thimerosal, genetic susceptibility and autism was not generally accepted in the medical community. Shortly after the expert was scheduled to be deposed in the Maryland case, the Skevofilaxes informed the judge and opposing counsel that the expert refused to participate further in the litigation. The Skevofilaxes filed a Motion for Dismissal of All Claims Without Prejudice, and Aventis Pasteur filed a Motion for Summary Judgment, the latter of which was granted.

For this reason, when the ... <em>Frye </em>test ... is at issue, it becomes the \u2018threshold question\u2019 of admissibility, to be resolved as a matter of law before the court exercises its discretion in applying all the criteria to a particular proffered expert: The question of the reliability of a scientific technique or process is unlike the question, for example, of the helpfulness of particular expert testimony to the trier of facts in a specific case. The answer to the question about the reliability of a scientific technique or process does not vary according to the circumstances of each case. It is therefore inappropriate to view this threshold question of reliability as a matter within each trial judge\u2019s individual discretion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b610-11\">But more succinctly courts should not subsume the question of qualifying the [scientific] process ... under the question of qualifying the expert.

The evidence bearing on whether the challenged evidence is actually the product of a novel scientific technique and, if so, whether that technique is generally accepted in the relevant scientific community will usually be collateral to the substantive issues at trial and may, itself, be inadmissible with respect to those substantive issues. That alone justifies resolving the issue prior to trial. Dealing with the issue pretrial also avoids delays and diversions at trial that may inconvenience both witnesses and the jury. <em>See </em>Maryland Rule 5-104(c) (\"Hearings on preliminary matters shall be conducted out of the hearing of the jury when required by rule or the interests of justice.\u201d).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b624-6\">Maryland Rule 5-103(c) also provides support for our conclusion that <em>Frye-Reed </em>examinations are better conducted in pre-trial hearings in its admonition that \u201c[pjroceedmgs shall be conducted, to the extent practicable, so as to prevent inadmissible evidence from being suggested to a jury by any means, such as making statements or offers of proof or asking questions within the hearing of the jury.\u201d Conducting the hearing outside the presence of the jury would preclude its members from improperly considering evidence that is irrelevant to the task at hand and ensure that the verdict is derived from evidence properly before it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b624-7\">If the issue is to be dealt with at trial, it should be addressed, in its entirety, as a preliminary matter prior to admission of the challenged evidence, not, as here, by having the challenge made only to Peters\u2019s status as an expert during the State's case and then receiving most of the evidence bearing on whether the inferences sought to be drawn from CBLA are generally accepted in the relevant scientific community during the defense case, after the challenged inferences have already been admitted.
