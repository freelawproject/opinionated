He urged the district court to help him obtain an award in a Title VII employment-discrimination class action that had allegedly been settled in 1994. The district court construed Brown\u2019s complaint as a 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 civil-rights action and dismissed it as frivolous, under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)\u00ae, adopting the recommendation of the magistrate judge. The magistrate judge had reviewed court orders and materials from the class action, <em>Shipes v. Trinity Industries, </em>No. 6:80-CV-462 (E.D.Tex.), and determined that there was no indication that Brown was a member of the plaintiff class. In dismissing Brown\u2019s complaint, the district court observed that Brown had provided no documentation to verify that he had been a Trinity employee.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-21\">A district court shall dismiss an IFP complaint at any time that the court determines that the complaint is frivolous. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)\u00ae. This court reviews a dismissal as frivolous for abuse of discretion. <em>Taylor v. Johnson, </em>257 F.3d 470, 472 (5th Cir.2001). A complaint is \u201cfrivolous\u201d if it lacks \u201can arguable basis in law or fact.\u201d <em>Berry v. Brady, </em>192 F.3d 504, 507 (5th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b926-22\">The magistrate judge and district court construed Brown\u2019s complaint as a civil rights action, and Brown has deferred to this interpretation. Brown\u2019s lawsuit does not fall under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, however, because his complaint named a private <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"899\">*899</page-number>company or corporation as defendant and alleged no violation of a constitutional or federal right. <em>See Calhoun v. Hargrove, </em>312 F.3d 730, 734 (5th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b927-5\">Brown\u2019s lawsuit is essentially a belated effort to intervene as a putative class member in the <em>Shipes </em>class action, which was filed in 1980, settled in January 1992, and closed in February 2002. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 24(a). He has asserted that his incarceration between October 1992 and 2000 prevented him from learning about the settlement. The timeliness of a motion to intervene is \u201cto be determined from all the circumstances,\u201d and the denial of such a motion is reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>National Ass \u2019n for the Advancement of Colored People v. New York, </em>413 U.S. 345, 366, 93 S.Ct. 2591, 37 L.Ed.2d 648 (1973). This court considers four factors in determining whether a motion to intervene was timely, including \u201cthe length of time during which the would-be intervenor actually knew or reasonably should have known of its interest in the case before it sought to intervene.\u201d <em>Heaton v. Monogram Credit Card Bank of Ga., </em>297 F.3d 416, 422-23 (5th Cir.2002). \u201cThere are no absolute measures of timeliness; it is determined from all the circumstances.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 423.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-6\">Brown\u2019s allegations reflect that he was working at Trinity at the time the <em>Shipes </em>lawsuit was filed and that he was not incarcerated at the time it was settled. Brown\u2019s May 2003 complaint sought relief for an alleged wrong that occurred almost a quarter-century earlier. He effectively seeks to intervene in a class action that was settled more than a decade ago and has since been closed. Such a motion to intervene would be untimely, and the dismissal of Brown\u2019s complaint was not an abuse of discretion. Brown\u2019s appeal is without arguable merit, <em>see Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983), and it is DISMISSED as frivolous. 5th Cir. R. 42.3. The dismissal of Brown\u2019s complaint and appeal in this matter each count as a \u201cstrike\u201d under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387 (5th Cir.1996). Brown is hereby is warned that if she accumulates three strikes, he may not proceed IFP in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b927-8\">APPEAL DISMISSED AS FRIVOLOUS; THREE-STRIKES WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b926-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
