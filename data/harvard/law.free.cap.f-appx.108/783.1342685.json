DeVaughn seeks to appeal the district court\u2019s orders denying relief on his Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b) motions in actions filed under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 (2000).<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> The court dismissed the actions as successive. The order is not appealable unless a circuit justice or judge issues a certificate of appealability. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1) (2000); <em>Reid v. Angelone, </em>369 F.3d 363, 368-69 (4th Cir.2004) (holding that appeal from the denial of a Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b) motion in a habeas action requires a certificate of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"784\">*784</page-number>appealability). A certificate of appealability will not issue absent \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2) (2000). A prisoner satisfies this standard by demonstrating that reasonable jurists would find that his constitutional claims are debatable and that any dispositive procedural rulings by the district court are also debatable or wrong. <em>See Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 336-38, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003); <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000); <em>Rose v. Lee, </em>252 F.3d 676, 683 (4th Cir.2001). We have independently reviewed the record and conclude that De-Vaughn has not made the requisite showing. Accordingly, we deny a certificate of appealability.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-4\">To the extent DeVaughn\u2019s notice of appeal and informal brief could be construed as a motion for authorization to file a successive \u00a7 2255 motion, we deny such authorization. <em>United States v. Winestock, </em>340 F.3d 200, 208 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 124 S.Ct. 496, 157 L.Ed.2d 395 (2003). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-6\">\n<em>DISMISSED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b811-12\">The actions were originally filed under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 (2000), and have been consolidated on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
