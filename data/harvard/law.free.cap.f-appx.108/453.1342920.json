We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review adverse credibility determinations for substantial evidence, <em>Singh-Kaur v. INS, </em>183 F.3d 1147, 1149 (9th Cir.1999), and we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-4\">Substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s finding that Teklu\u2019s credibility was undermined by inconsistencies in his testimony, as well as a letter from the United States Embassy in Ethiopia concluding that the documentary evidence he submitted to support his claim was fraudulent. Because the genuineness of these documents goes to the heart of Teklu\u2019s claim, we conclude that Teklu failed to satisfy his burden of proof with credible, direct, and specific evidence in the record. <em>See Desta v. Ashcroft, </em>365 F.3d 741, 745 (9th Cir.2004). The record does not compel a contrary conclusion. <em>See INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 481, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b482-5\">Because Petitioner did not testify credibly, he failed to establish eligibility for asylum or withholding of removal. <em>See Singh-Kaur v. INS, </em>183 F.3d at 1149.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-6\">Petitioner failed to establish entitlement to CAT relief because, in the absence of credible evidence, he did not demonstrate that it is \u201cmore likely than not\u201d that he would be tortured if returned to Ethiopia. <em>See Malhi v. INS, </em>336 F.3d 989, 993 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b482-7\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b481-16\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
