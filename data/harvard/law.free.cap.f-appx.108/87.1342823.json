R.Civ.P. 41(b). After the district court dismissed Leudvick\u2019s petition for failure to inform the court of a new address, Leudviek filed a notice of appeal. He subsequently filed a document tending to show that he did not have a new address. The district court construed this document as a motion for relief from judgment pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b)(1) and issued an order indicating its inclination to grant the motion. <em>See Fobian v. Storage Tech. Corp., </em>164 F.3d 887, 891 (4th Cir.1999). This Court remanded for the limited purpose <em>of </em>considering the merits of Leudvick\u2019s motion pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b). <em>See Fobian, </em>164 F.3d at 892.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-4\">On remand, the district court entered an order vacating the October 23, 2003, order of dismissal, and reopened the action.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Because the order on appeal has been vacated, this appeal is now moot. <em>Mellen v. Bunting, </em>327 F.3d 355, 363-64 (4th Cir.2003) (\u201cWhen a case has become moot after the entry of the district court\u2019s judgment, an appellate court no longer has jurisdiction to entertain the appeal.\u201d), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 124 S.Ct. 1750, 158 L.Ed.2d 636 (2004). Therefore, we dismiss the appeal as moot. We deny Leudvick\u2019s motion for appointment of counsel, and dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-7\">\n<em>DISMISSED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b116-9\"> The district court, by order of June 1, 2004, again dismissed the action without prejudice, citing Fed.R.Civ.P. 41(b). Leudvick has not noted an appeal from that order.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
