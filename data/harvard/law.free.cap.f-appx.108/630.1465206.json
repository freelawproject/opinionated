Anderson, Ill\u2019s appeal of the judgment in <em>Anderson v. United States, </em>59 Fed.Cl. 451 (2004), as untimely. Anderson opposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-14\">On February 17, 2004, the United States Court of Federal Claims entered its final judgment dismissing Anderson\u2019s complaint. The trial court denied Anderson\u2019s motion for reconsideration on March 3, 2004. On April 21, 2004, the Court of Federal Claims granted Anderson\u2019s request for an extension of time to appeal the judgment, stating: \u201cAny notice of appeal filed in this case must be received by the Clerk\u2019s Office of the United States Court of Federal Claims on or before May 28, 2004.\u201d Anderson states that although he received trial court\u2019s order granting his extension of time in April, he waited until May 27, 2004, one day before the due date, to mail his notice of appeal, anticipating that it would be delivered the next day. The Court of Federal Claims received the notice of appeal on June 1, 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>To be timely, a notice of appeal must be filed within 60 days of entry of final judgment, or within the time extended by the trial court pursuant to Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(5). <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2107; Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(1)(B). \u201cThe courts have uniformly held that the taking of an appeal within the prescribed time is mandatory and jurisdictional.\u201d <em>United States v. Robinson, </em>861 U.S. 220, 229, 80 S.Ct. 282, 4 L.Ed.2d 259 (1960). Therefore, because Anderson filed his notice of appeal seeking review by this court after the date extended by the Court of Federal Claims and more than 60 days after entry of the trial court\u2019s final judgment, we must dismiss for untimeliness.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-5\">Accordingly,</p>\n<p id=\"b927-6\">IT IS ORDERED THAT:</p>\n<p id=\"b927-7\">(1) The United States\u2019 motion to dismiss is granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-8\">(2) Each side shall bear its own costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
