He argues that the district court committed reversible error when it refused his request for a jury instruction on withdrawal from the conspiracy.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-20\">Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to Medina, we conclude that there was a sufficient evidentiary foundation for a jury instruction on withdrawal. <em>United States v. Dixon, </em>185 F.3d 393, 402 (5th Cir.1999). Specifically, Medina\u2019s testimony and the testimony of Marcos Medina constituted sufficient evidence that Medina committed affirmative acts inconsistent with the object of the conspiracy and that he communicated those acts in a manner reasonably calculated to reach the conspirators. <em>United States v. Puig-Infante, </em>19 F.3d 929, 945 (5th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b972-21\">Because the record sufficiently supports the defensive theory of withdrawal from the conspiracy to entitle Medina to a jury instruction on withdrawal, we VACATE his conspiracy conviction and REMAND this matter for further proceedings. <em>United States v. John, </em>309 F.3d 298, 304 (5th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b972-22\">VACATED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b972-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
