Nazien also seeks review of the BIA\u2019s denial of his motion to remand for consideration of new evidence to support his claim that he is a citizen of the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-16\">This court does not have jurisdiction to review a final order of removal of an alien who is removable for being convicted of certain criminal offenses. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C). This court does have \u201cjurisdiction to review jurisdictional facts and determine the proper scope of its own jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Flores-Garza v. INS, </em>328 F.3d 797, 802 (5th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b189-17\">Nazien does not challenge the BIA\u2019s determination that he is removable for being convicted of a criminal offense. Nazien argues that the BIA erred in finding that he was not a citizen under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1433. As the BIA found, the record contains no evidence that Nazien\u2019s father filed an application seeking to make Nazien a citizen after Nazien\u2019s father was naturalized in 1973. There is no substantial issue of fact that, if resolved in his favor, would show that Nazien is not an alien. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(5). Accordingly, this court is without jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s order. <em>See Balogun v. Ashcroft, </em>270 F.3d 274, 277-78 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b189-18\">Nazien argues for the first time on appeal that he is a \u201cnational\u201d of the Unites States because his parents intended that he become a citizen. Nazien\u2019s failure to raise this claim before the BIA deprives this court of jurisdiction over the issue. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1); <em>Wang v. Ashcroft, </em>260 F.3d 448, 452-453 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b189-19\">Nazien\u2019s petition for review is DISMISSED for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b189-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
