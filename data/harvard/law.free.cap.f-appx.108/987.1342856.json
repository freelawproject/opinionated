He argues that 1) the district court erred in denying his motion to suppress evidence, 2) the indictment was insufficient and the evidence introduced at trial was insufficient, 3) the district court lacked jurisdiction, 4) the district court abused its discretion in ordering that he be committed for a mental competency evaluation pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4241, 5) the district court erred in denying his motion to dismiss the indictment for a speedy trial violation, 6) the district court erred in denying his post-conviction motions, and 7) the sentence was erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-16\">The district court did not err in denying Harrison\u2019s motion to suppress evidence. The vehicle in which Harrison was a passenger was stopped after he was observed riding without a seat belt in violation of state law, and the scope and duration of the stop were reasonably related to the circumstances that justified it. Furthermore, the search of the vehicle that ultimately revealed the presence of illegal drugs was made pursuant to the arresting officer\u2019s receipt of Harrison\u2019s voluntary consent.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1016-17\">Harrison\u2019s indictment was sufficient. It alleged each essential element of both conspiracy under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846 and possession of a controlled substance with intent to distribute under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1) so as to enable Harrison to prepare his defense and invoke the double jeopardy clause in any subsequent proceeding.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The indictment conformed, at the very least, to minimal constitutional standards.</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"989\">*989</page-number>The evidence presented at trial was sufficient to support Harrison\u2019s convictions on both counts of the indictment. The prosecution presented Harrison\u2019s own statement that he had agreed to drive a car from Philadelphia to Houston and back in exchange for a large sum of money. In addition, the jury could infer Harrison\u2019s involvement in a conspiracy based upon the substantial circumstantial evidence of his participation therein presented at trial.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Furthermore, the verdict was supported by evidence as to the amount of drugs found in Harrison\u2019s possession, and his knowledge of the presence of drugs in his vehicle. Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the Government, a rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crimes charged beyond a reasonable doubt.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1017-5\">Harrison\u2019s arguments that the district court lacked jurisdiction are frivolous.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Likewise, his contentions that the district court abused its discretion in ordering that he be committed for further mental evaluation pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4241(d) are without merit.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1017-6\">The district court did not err in denying Harrison\u2019s motion to dismiss the indictment under the Speedy Trial Act. The Act provides that a defendant must be tried within 70 days from the filing of indictment or date he appears, whichever occurs last.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> However, the Act excludes from this 70-day period any period of delay resulting from, <em>inter alia, </em>examinations to determine the mental competency of the defendant.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Harrison was indicted on January 5, 1999. Beginning on January 7, 1999, Harrison underwent multiple evaluations in an effort to establish his competency to stand trial. He was finally adjudicated competent on April 16, 2002, and was tried on June 3, 2002. By properly excluding the lengthy period during which Harrison was subject to mental competency evaluations, the district court correctly found that the 70-day requirement of the Speedy Trial Act was satisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-15\">Harrison\u2019s contention that the district court erred in denying his numerous post-conviction motions is likewise without merit. Harrison\u2019s arguments on this score are largely cumulative, with the exception of his claim that the drugs seized from his vehicle should not have been admitted at trial because the government failed to produce chain of custody documentation. On this count, Harrison has failed to demonstrate an abuse of discretion on the part of the trial court in admitting this evidence, or any resulting impairment of his substantial rights.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1018-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"990\">*990</page-number>Finally, the district court properly applied the United States Sentencing Guidelines in formulating Harrison\u2019s sentence. The court did not err in finding that Harrison willfully obstructed justice by feigning incompetence in order to avoid trial.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> In addition, the court correctly included three criminal history points in Harrison\u2019s score for his 1981 conviction for criminal possession of a forged instrument when the resulting incarceration extended into the fifteen year period preceding the instant offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-4\">In addition to raising the seven points of error discussed above, Harrison has filed a motion to file a reply brief in excess pages, arguing that he needs an additional space to fully address sentencing issues raised by <em>Blakely v. </em>Washington.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Because this court has held that <em>Blakely </em>does not apply to the United States Sentencing Guidelines,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Harrison\u2019s motion to file a reply brief in excess pages is DENIED AS UNNECESSARY. Finally, Harrison has filed a motion for reconsideration of the denial of his motion for release pending appeal. This motion is DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-5\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED, and appellant\u2019s motions are DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1016-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
