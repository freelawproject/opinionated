We affirm in part and dismiss in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-10\">When the United States or its officer or agency is a party, the notice of appeal must be filed no more than sixty days after the entry of the district court\u2019s final judgment or order, Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(1)(B), unless the district court extends the appeal period under Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(5), or reopens the appeal period under Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(6). This appeal period is \u201cmandatory and jurisdictional.\u201d <em>Browder v. Dir., Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>434 U.S. 257, 264, 98 S.Ct. 556, 54 L.Ed.2d 521 (1978) (quoting <em>United States v. Robinson, </em>361 U.S. 220, 229, 80 S.Ct. 282, 4 L.Ed.2d 259 (1960)).</p>\n<p id=\"b136-13\">The district court\u2019s order dismissing Jaffer\u2019s complaint was entered on the docket on December 23, 2003. The notice of appeal was filed on April 12, 2004. Because Jaffer failed to file a timely notice of appeal or to obtain an extension or reopening of the appeal period, we dismiss Jaffer\u2019s appeal from the orders described in (1), (2), (3), and (4) above. <em>See McLaurin v. Fischer, </em>768 F.2d 98, 101 (6th Cir.1985) (noting that appeal from final judgment calls into question all previous rulings leading to judgment).</p>\n<p id=\"b136-15\">Turning to Jaffer\u2019s timely appeal from the district court\u2019s order denying her Rule 60(b) motion, we have reviewed the record and find no reversible error. Accordingly, we affirm for the reasons stated by the district court. <em>See Jaffer v. Nat\u2019l Black Caucus &amp; Ctr. on Black Aged, Inc., </em>No. CA-03-96-1 (M.D.N.C. Mar. 11, 2004). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-16\">\n<em>AFFIRMED IN PART; DISMISSED IN PART</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
