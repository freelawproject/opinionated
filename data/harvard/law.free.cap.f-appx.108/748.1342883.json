In No. 03-1183, Ameh petitions for review of the Board\u2019s order affirming, without opinion, the immigration judge\u2019s order denying Ameh\u2019s motion to terminate proceedings, granting voluntary departure, and entering an alternate order of removal to Ghana. In No. 04-1134, Ameh petitions for review of the Board\u2019s subsequent order denying his motion to reopen.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-7\">We first address the Board\u2019s denial of Ameh\u2019s motion to reopen and find that the Board did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion as untimely filed. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2) (2004); <em>INS v. Doherty, </em>502 U.S. 314, 323-24, 112 S.Ct. 719, 116 L.Ed.2d 823 (1992). We further find that we lack jurisdiction to review Ameh\u2019s claim that the Board should have exercised its sua sponte power to reopen his removal proceedings. <em>See Calle-Vujiles v. Ashcroft, </em>320 F.3d 472, 474-75 (3d Cir.2003); <em>Ekimian v. INS, </em>303 F.3d 1153, 1159 (9th Cir.2002); <em>Luis v. INS, </em>196 F.3d 36, 40-41 (1st Cir.1999). Accordingly, we deny the petition for review in No. 04-1134.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-8\">Additionally, we uphold the immigration judge\u2019s finding that the state court\u2019s grant of probation before judgment constituted a \u201cconviction\u201d within the meaning of the federal immigration laws. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(48)(A) (2000); <em>Yanez-Popp v. INS, </em>998 F.2d 231, 234-37 (4th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b777-9\">Finally, to the extent that Ameh claims that the Board\u2019s use of the summary affirmance procedure as set forth in 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(e)(4) (2004) violated his rights under the Due Process Clause, we find that this claim is squarely foreclosed by our recent decision in <em>Blanco de Belbruno v. Ashcroft, </em>362 F.3d 272 (4th Cir.2004). We do not separately review whether the Board appropriately streamlined this case. <em>See id. </em>at 281 (holding that the remedy when the Board improperly affirms a case under its summary affirmance procedures, for example, by \u201callowing] a non-harmless error to slip through,\u201d is judicial review of the immigration judge\u2019s decision). We therefore deny the petition for review in No. 03-1183.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-11\">Accordingly, we deny both petitions for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-12\">\n<em>PETITIONS DENIED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
