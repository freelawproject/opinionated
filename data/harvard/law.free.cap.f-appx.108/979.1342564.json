Vasquez appeals his convictions and his sentence, while Botello appeals only his sentences. <em>Vasquez</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1008-8\">Vasquez first argues that the evidence was insufficient to sustain his convictions. He contends that the testimony of the Government\u2019s confidential witness was incredible and insubstantial and that there was no credible evidence to show that he committed the offenses for which he was indicted. \u201cAs long as it is not factually insubstantial or incredible, the uncorroborated testimony of a co-conspirator, even one who has chosen to cooperate with the government in exchange for non-prosecution or leniency, may be constitutionally sufficient evidence to convict.\u201d <em>United States v. Westbrook, </em>119 F.3d 1176, 1190 (5th Cir.1997). We have reviewed the record, and we cannot agree that the testimony of the confidential witness was insubstantial or incredible. Moreover, a review of the sufficiency of the evidence does not include review of the weight of the evidence or of witness credibility. <em>See United States v. Garcia, </em>995 F.2d 556, 561 (5th Cir.1993). The evidence was sufficient to support Vasquez\u2019s convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-13\">Vasquez also challenges the district court\u2019s evidentiary rulings. He argues that the district court erred in admitting the hearsay statements of co-conspirators under Fed.R.Evid. 801(d)(2)(e). The district court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the challenged evidence. <em>See United States v. Cornett, </em>195 F.3d 776, 782 (5th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-14\">Vasquez also challenges the admission of mugshots taken following his arrest. The district court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the mugshots. <em>See United States v. Carrillo, </em>20 F.3d 617, 620 (5th Cir.1994); <em>United States v. Torres-Flores, </em>827 F.2d 1031, 1039 (5th Cir.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-15\">Vasquez also contends that the district court erred in refusing to admit, pursuant to Fed.R.Evid. 804(b)(3), an out-of-court exculpatory statement made by a co-conspirator. The district court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to admit the statement. <em>See United States v. Vega, </em>221 F.3d 789, 803 (5th Cir.2000). Because Vasquez has not shown error on the part of the district court with respect to his convictions, the convictions are AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-16\">Finally, Vasquez argues that his 63-month sentence for possessing with intent to distribute less than 50 kilograms of marijuana should be corrected because it exceeds the 60-month statutory maximum under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(D). The Government concedes the error. We review for plain error because Vasquez did not object in the district court. <em>See United States v. Villarreal, </em>253 F.3d 831, 837 (5th Cir.2001). \u201c[A] sentence which exceeds the statutory maximum is an illegal sen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"981\">*981</page-number>tence and therefore constitutes plain error.\u201d <em>United States v. Sias, </em>227 F.3d 244, 246 (5th Cir.2000). Because the error seriously affects the fairness and integrity of judicial proceedings, we will exercise our discretion to correct it. <em>See United States v. Aderholt, </em>87 F.3d 740, 744 (5th Cir.1996). Accordingly, we VACATE Vasquez\u2019s sentence for possession with intent to distribute less than 50 kilograms of marijuana and remand for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-5\">\n<em>Botello</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-6\">Botello challenges his sentences on two grounds. Botello first argues that his offense level should have been reduced by two levels for acceptance of responsibility under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3El.l(a) because he admitted responsibility for the 90 pounds of marijuana found in his vehicle. We accord great deference to the district court\u2019s denial of acceptance of responsibility. <em>See United States v. Jefferson, </em>258 F.3d 405, 412 (5th Cir.2001). Because Botello proceeded to trial and disputed his role in the offense, we decline to disturb the district court\u2019s determination that Botello is not entitled to a reduction for acceptance of responsibility. <em>See United States v. Dean, </em>59 F.3d 1479, 1496 (5th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-7\">Botello also argues that the district court erred in holding him responsible for 540 pounds of marijuana. The district court\u2019s determination that Botello was responsible for 540 pounds of marijuana was plausible in light of the record as a whole and thus was not clearly erroneous. <em>See United States v. Alford, </em>142 F.3d 825, 831 (5th Cir.1998). Botello\u2019s sentences are AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-8\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED IN PART, VACATED IN PART, AND REMANDED FOR RESENTENCING AS TO VASQUEZ ONLY.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1008-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
