Gibbs argues that the district court erred in submitting a jury instruction on deliberate ignorance.</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-5\">Because Gibbs failed to object to the court\u2019s jury instruction, the issue is reviewed for plain error. <em>See United, States v. Harris, </em>104 F.3d 1465, 1471-72 (5th Cir.1997). This court will uphold the deliberate ignorance instruction so long as sufficient evidence supports its inclusion. <em>Id. </em>at 951.</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-6\">The record contains substantial evidence that Gibbs had actual knowledge of the presence of the firearm in his vehicle. Testimony from two different arresting officers provided that Gibbs made statements concerning his awareness of the presence of the firearm. The jury was entitled to believe this testimony. <em>See United States v. Lopez, </em>74 F.3d 575, 577 (5th Cir.1996). Moreover, testimony from the officers concerning the unusual way in which Gibbs was seated to conceal the firearm supports the conclusion that Gibbs was aware of the firearm. Accordingly, no plain error occurred in the court\u2019s submission of the instruction. <em>See Threadgill, </em>172 F.3d at 369.</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-7\">Gibbs further argues that the district court\u2019s deliberate ignorance instruction failed to contain an element of conscious avoidance. Gibbs cannot demonstrate plain error with respect to this argument because the district court\u2019s instruction tracked the relevant pattern jury charge and he did not object to the instruction at trial. <em>See United States v. Stewart, </em>879 F.2d 1268, 1271 (5th Cir.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-8\">Gibbs finally argues that this court should reconsider its jurisprudence regarding the constitutionality of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1). \u201cThis court has repeatedly emphasized that the constitutionality of \u00a7 922(g)(1) is not open to question.\u201d <em>See United States v. Daugherty, </em>264 F.3d 513, 518 (5th Cir.2001). Gibbs concedes that his argument is foreclosed by case law from this circuit. He raises his argument solely to preserve it for Supreme Court review. The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1020-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"993\">*993</page-number>the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
