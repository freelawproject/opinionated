INS, </em>37 F.3d 185, 188 (5th Cir.1994). Rivera makes vague assertions that, due to his father\u2019s military status, he was persecuted before he left El Salvador in 1993, but he does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"930\">*930</page-number>explain how he was persecuted, nor does he offer any evidence that any members of his family living in El Salvador have ever been targets of persecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-4\">The only evidence of harassment that Rivera offered was that, upon his return to El Salvador in 2001, his coworkers issued death threats and were aggressive toward him due to his refusal to participate in a political protest march with them. Rivera\u2019s coworkers\u2019 anger was due, however, to the fact that Rivera could expose to authorities criminal activities that occurred during the march, not due to Rivera\u2019s political opinion. In addition, as the IJ noted, Rivera can avoid such coworker conduct by relocating to a city other than those in which he had lived. Accordingly, the IJ did not err in denying Rivera\u2019s asylum and withholding of removal application.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-5\">Rivera has not identified any error in the IJ\u2019s determination that he was not eligible for withholding of removal under the Convention Against Torture. Therefore, Rivera has waived this issue. <em>See Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b958-6\">\n<em>DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b957-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
