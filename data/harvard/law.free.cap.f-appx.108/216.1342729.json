We review the district court\u2019s application of the guidelines <em>de novo </em>and its factual determinations for clear error. <em>See United States v. Ocana, </em>204 F.3d 585, 588 (5th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b244-24\">To be considered \u201crelevant conduct,\u201d conduct must be \u201cpart of the same course of conduct or common scheme or plan as the offense of conviction.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.3(a)(2) (2003). However, conduct associated with a sentence imposed prior to the commission of the instant offense is \u201cnot part of the same course of conduct or common scheme or plan as the offense of conviction.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.3, comment. (n.8). We do not find this note plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the guidelines. We also are persuaded that the Presentence Report (\u201cPSR\u201d) provided a sufficient and reliable evidentiary basis to conclude that Salinas\u2019s prior offense <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>conduct was not part of the same course of conduct or common scheme or plan as the instant offense of conviction. <em>See United States v. Cabrera, </em>288 F.3d 163, 172 (5th Cir.2002) (if PSR contains sufficient evidentiary basis and indicia that information is reliable, absent rebuttal evidence, district court may adopt PSR\u2019s findings without further inquiry). Salinas also challenges, for the first time, the constitutionality of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841 and 846 in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). As Salinas concedes, his <em>Apprendi </em>argument is foreclosed by <em>United States v. Slaughter, </em>238 F.3d 580, 582 (5th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b244-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
