R.CrvP. 8(a). The appellants\u2019 arguments are difficult to decipher but appear to be merely a continuation of the disjointed allegations of the plaintiffs\u2019 complaint. The district court was correct in concluding that the complaint does not comply with Rule 8(a)(2) in that it fails to provide sufficient notice of the circumstances giving rise to their claims or to set forth sufficient information to outline the elements of their claims. <em>See </em>Fed.R.CivP. 8(a)(2). Because it is impossible to discern from the complaint the exact basis of the appellants\u2019 claims or the legal theories on which they seek redress against any or all of the named defendants, the district court\u2019s dismissal is AFFIRMED. <em>See General Star Indem. Co. v. Vesta Fire Ins. Corp., </em>173 F.3d 946, 950 (5th Cir.1999); <em>Conley v. Gibson, </em>355 U.S. 41, 47, 78 S.Ct. 99, 2 L.Ed.2d 80 (1957). Because the district court\u2019s dismissal was without prejudice, the appellants remain free to file another complaint in compliance with Fed.R.Civ.P. 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-6\">The appellants\u2019 motion for leave to supplement their record excerpts is DENIED. Gaylord Chemical Corporation and Gay-lord Container Corporation move to dismiss Gaylord Paper Manufacturer and its attorneys as a named defendant, and the appellants oppose the motion in their own motion to add a \u201cDMSO\u201d Defendant. These motions are similarly DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-11\">AFFIRMED; MOTIONS DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b242-7\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
