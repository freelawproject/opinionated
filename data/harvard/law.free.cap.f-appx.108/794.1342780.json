For the reasons discussed below, we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-23\">Hassen asserts that his evidence was sufficient to establish his eligibility for asylum. To obtain reversal of a determination denying eligibility for relief, an alien \u201cmust show that the evidence he presented was so compelling that no reasonable fact-finder could fail to find the requisite fear of persecution.\u201d <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 483-84, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992). We have reviewed the evidence of record and conclude that Has-sen fails to show that the evidence compels a contrary result.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b823-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"795\">*795</page-number>Accordingly, we deny the petition for review.
