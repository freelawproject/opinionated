Floyd challenges the district court\u2019s denial of his motion to suppress statements that he gave following his arrest and evidence that was seized in a search of Nicole Brown\u2019s apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-8\">Floyd asserts that the police entered Brown\u2019s apartment without consent and illegally detained him. He contends that Brown\u2019s consent to a search of the apartment did not remove the taint of the illegal entry and detention. He argues that his statements should have been suppressed because they were obtained through custodial interrogation after an illegal arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-9\">We review the denial of a motion to suppress in the light most favorable to the prevailing party, which in this case is the Government. <em>United States v. Mendoza-Gonzalez, </em>318 F.3d 663, 666 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>538 U.S. 1049, 123 S.Ct. 2114, 155 L.Ed.2d 1091 (2003). A warrantless search violates the Fourth Amendment unless the search falls within a specific exception to the warrant requirement. <em>United States v. Jaras, </em>86 F.3d 383, 388 (5th Cir.1996). Consent is \u201c \u2018one of the specifically established exceptions\u2019 \u201d to the warrant requirement. <em>Id. </em>We examine \u201cthe totality of the circumstances\u201d to determine whether consent was knowing and voluntary. <em>United States v. Davis, </em>749 F.2d 292, 294 (5th Cir.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b199-14\">When an appellant asserts that evidence obtained subsequent to an illegal search or detention is tainted or is fruit of the prior illegality, the pertinent inquiry is whether the challenged evidence was obtained \u201cby exploitation of [the initial] illegality or instead by means sufficiently distinguishable to be purged of the primary taint.\u201d <em>Segura v. United States, </em>468 U.S. 796, 804-05, 104 S.Ct. 3380, 82 L.Ed.2d 599 (1984) (citations and internal quotations omitted). The question whether a confession is the product of a free will must be answered based on the facts of the individual case. <em>Brown v. Illinois, </em>422 U.S. 590, 603, 95 S.Ct. 2254, 45 L.Ed.2d 416 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b199-15\">The evidence supports the district court\u2019s rulings on Floyd\u2019s suppression motion. <em>See United States v. Richard, </em>994 F.2d 244, 250-52 (5th Cir.1993); <em>United States v. Miller, </em>608 F.2d 1089, 1102-03 (5th Cir.1979). Accordingly, we AFFIRM the denial of Floyd\u2019s motion to suppress his statements and the evidence seized from Brown\u2019s apartment. <em>Mendoza-Gonzalez, </em>318 F.3d at 666.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-16\">Floyd contends that the district court erred by denying his request to strike for cause venire member Jamie Sample. Floyd asserts that refusal to strike Sample for cause required him to use a peremptory challenge that he could have used to strike a juror who was not impartial.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-17\">We review the district court\u2019s decision on a motion to strike a potential juror for cause for a \u201c \u2018manifest abuse of discretion.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Wharton, </em>320 F.3d 526, 535 (5th Cir.2003), <em>cert. denied, </em>539 U.S. 916, 123 S.Ct. 2288, 156 L.Ed.2d 132 (2003). The district court\u2019s decision <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>was based on Sample\u2019s demeanor and her sworn statements. We accord deference to the trial judge\u2019s ruling on potential juror bias. <em>See United States v. Duncan, </em>191 F.3d 569, 573 (5th Cir.1999). Floyd has not established that any member of the jury in his case was not impartial. <em>See Wharton, </em>320 F.3d at 535.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-4\">Floyd contends that the instructions to the jury denied him the right to have the jury consider his guilt on each Count of the indictment separately. The district court instructed the jury to consider each count of the indictment as a separate charge and to make a decision on Floyd\u2019s guilt as to each count separately. The \u201cjury is presumed to follow the court\u2019s instructions.\u201d <em>United States v. Simmons, </em>374 F.3d 313, 321 (5th Cir.2004). The district court\u2019s charge as a whole correctly stated the law and the issues. <em>Simmons, </em>374 F.3d 313, 317. Floyd has not shown plain error. <em>United States v. Rivas, </em>99 F.3d 170, 174 (5th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">Finally, Floyd contends that, without his confessions and the evidence that was seized from Brown\u2019s apartment, the evidence produced by the Government was not sufficient to convict him. In light of the foregoing, Floyd\u2019s argument is without merit. Accordingly, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b199-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
