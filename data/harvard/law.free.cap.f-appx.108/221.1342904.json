We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-8\">Maldonado\u2019s argument that the magistrate judge was without authority to refer the motion to recuse to the district judge is frivolous; if the issue of a judge recusing herself arises either through a motion to recuse under \u00a7 <em>455 </em>or an affidavit of prejudice under \u00a7 144, the judge has the option to either transfer the matter to another judge for decision or determine it herself. <em>See Doddy v. Oxy USA Inc., </em>101 F.3d 448, 458 n. 7 (5th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b250-9\">Maldonado\u2019s motion for recusal was based solely on conclusional allegations of prejudice stemming from adverse rulings. Adverse judicial rulings alone, however, do not support an allegation of bias under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 455 or 144, and, therefore, the denial of the motion was not an abuse of discretion. <em>See Liteky v. United States, </em>510 U.S. 540, 555, 114 S.Ct. 1147, 127 L.Ed.2d 474 (1994); <em>Matassarin v. Lynch, </em>174 F.3d 549, 571 (5th Cir.1999). Maldonado did not raise in his initial brief the ultimate issue whether his claims lacked an arguable basis in fact, and, therefore, that issue is not considered. <em>See Cinel v. Connick, </em>15 F.3d 1338, 1345 (5th Cir.1994). Furthermore, as the magistrate judge pointed out in her report of July 14, 2003, no causal connection is set forth, or is conceivable, between Maldonado\u2019s electromagnetic hypersensitivity and the Attorney General of the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-14\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b250-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
