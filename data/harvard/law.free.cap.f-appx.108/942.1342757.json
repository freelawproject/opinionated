He also argues that the evidence is insufficient to support his conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-6\">Due process requires the Government to preserve evidence that meets the standard of \u201cconstitutional materiality,\u201d or evidence that possesses both \u201can exculpatory value that was apparent before the evidence was destroyed, and be of such a nature that the defendant would be unable to obtain comparable evidence by other reasonably available means.\u201d <em>California v. Trombetta, </em>467 U.S. 479, 489, 104 S.Ct. 2528, 81 L.Ed.2d 413 (1984). Unless a criminal defendant can show bad faith on the part of the police, failure to preserve potentially useful evidence does not constitute a denial of due process. <em>Arizona v. Youngblood, </em>488 U.S. 51, 57-58, 109 S.Ct. 333, 102 L.Ed.2d 281 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b971-7\">Moore\u2019s argument assumes that the videotape once contained footage of the carjacking, but no evidence supports this assumption. Moore also argues that the police officer used an improper device to view the videotape, and he speculates that viewing the tape in an improper device destroyed its contents. No evidence supports Moore\u2019s assumption that the police officer\u2019s actions destroyed the contents of the videotape. Additionally, Moore does not argue that the Government acted in bad faith with respect to the videotape. Moore thus has not established that the videotape possessed an exculpatory value that was apparent before the evidence was allegedly destroyed, nor has he established that the Government acted in bad faith. His failure-to-preserve-evidenee claim therefore is unavailing. <em>Trombetta, </em>467 U.S. at 489; <em>Arizona, </em>488 U.S. at 57-58.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-11\">Additionally, while Moore complains that the Government\u2019s delay in producing the evidence also violated due process, Moore fails to argue that if the videotape had been disclosed earlier, the result of the proceeding would have been different. Moore thus has failed to establish the materiality of the evidence and therefore he has not established that his right to a fair trial was jeopardized by the delay in producing the evidence. <em>See United States v. O\u2019Keefe, </em>128 F.3d 885, 898 (5th Cir.1997); <em>United States v. Green, </em>46 F.3d 461, 464 (5th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b971-12\">Moore\u2019s challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence is also unavailing because the testimony of Michael Jackson, the carjacking victim, and Officer John Strong, a Jackson, Mississippi, police officer who stopped the stolen car and apprehended Moore, supports the conclusion that Jackson\u2019s vehicle was stolen from him while he was at a car wash, that the three men who stole the vehicle from Jackson had guns, that Moore used a weapon during the carjacking, and that Moore fired his weapon at Jackson as he and the others attempted to flee in Jackson\u2019s car. These facts establish that Moore committed the offenses of carjacking and discharging a firearm during and in relation to a crime of violence. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(l)(a)(iii); 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2119; <em>see also United States v. Harris, </em>25 F.3d 1275, 1278 (5th Cir.1994) (discussing offense elements); <em>United States v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"944\">*944</page-number><em>Pankhurst, </em>118 F.3d 345, 352 (5th Cir.1997). Although Moore argues that Jackson erroneously identified one of the three individuals who stole the car and that a co-defendant of Moore presented a contrary version of the carjacking, Moore\u2019s arguments go to the weight of the evidence and to witness credibility, both of which are not part of an evidence sufficiency review. <em>United States v. Garcia, </em>995 F.2d 556, 561 (5th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b972-4\">For the foregoing reasons, the district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b970-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"943\">*943</page-number>published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
