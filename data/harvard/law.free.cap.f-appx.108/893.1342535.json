He contends that police lacked probable cause to stop his car; that police lacked reasonable suspicion to extend the stop beyond the time necessary to effectuate the purpose of the stop; that he should have received a three-level adjustment for acceptance of responsibility instead of a two-level adjustment; and that U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3El.l(b) violates the separation of powers doctrine by conferring judicial power on the executive branch.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-7\">When we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the government, we are satisfied that the police had reasonable suspicion to stop Baird\u2019s car. <em>See United States v. Sanchez-Pena, </em>336 F.3d 431, 436 &amp; n. 2 (5th Cir.2003). Baird\u2019s failure to use his turn signal justified the stop. <em>See </em>Tex. Transp. Code Ann. \u00a7 545.104(a)(Vernon 1999). Baird\u2019s inadequate proof of insurance and the asking of legitimate questions about his passenger\u2019s identity while computer checks were being run provided the police with reasonable suspicion to support the continued detention of the car for the period in question. <em>See United States v. Valadez, </em>267 F.3d 395, 398 (5th Cir.2001); <em>United States v. Shabazz, </em>993 F.2d 431, 437 (5th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b922-9\">In the district court, Baird did not raise the same contentions regarding the lack of an adjustment for acceptance of responsibility that he raises on appeal. We therefore review these for plain error. <em>United States v. Calverley, </em>37 F.3d 160, 162-64 (5th Cir.1994)(en banc). The Sentencing Guidelines provide the government with discretion to move for the additional one-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility, <em>see </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3El.l(b). Baird\u2019s arguments that the government lacks such discretion or that the government abused its discretion are unavailing. Further, Baird has failed to demonstrate plain error in the determination that regarding whether U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3El.l(b) does not violate the separation of powers doctrine. <em>See Mistretta v. United States, </em>488 U.S. 361, 390, 109 S.Ct. 647, 102 L.Ed.2d 714 (1989); <em>United States v. Santoyo, </em>146 F.3d 519, 523 (7th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b922-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b922-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
