Smith filed the petition to challenge his 18-year sentence for aggravated sexual assault of a child. Smith argues that it was error for the district court to <em>sua sponte </em>dismiss his petition as time-barred, without giving him an opportunity to present argument opposing dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-22\">In order to obtain a COA, Smith must show that jurists of reason would find it debatable whether his petition states a valid claim of the denial of a constitutional right and whether the district court was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"897\">*897</page-number>correct in its procedural ruling. <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000). Smith has satisfied this burden.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-5\">Accordingly, IT IS ORDERED that COA be granted on Smith\u2019s claim that he is entitled to equitable tolling due to mental incompetency, VACATE the district court\u2019s denial of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 relief, and REMAND to the district court for further proceedings. <em>See Dickinson v. Wainwright, </em>626 F.2d 1184, 1186 (5th Cir.1980). COA is denied as to any remaining issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-6\">COA GRANTED IN PART, DENIED IN PART; VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b924-7\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
