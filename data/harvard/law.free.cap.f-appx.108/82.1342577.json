A certificate of appealability will not issue absent \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2) (2000). A prisoner satisfies this standard by demonstrating that reasonable jurists would find that his constitutional claims are debatable and that any dispositive procedural rulings by the district court are also debatable or wrong. <em>See Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 336, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003); <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000); <em>Rose v. Lee, </em>252 F.3d 676, 683 (4th Cir.2001). We have independently reviewed the record and conclude that Sherrill has not made the requisite showing.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-21\">Accordingly, while we grant Sherrill\u2019s motion for permission to file an oversized informal brief, we deny a certificate of appealability and dismiss the appeal. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-5\">\n<em>DISMISSED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b110-16\"> We initially remanded this case to the district court for a determination as to whether Sherrill could show good cause or excusable neglect with respect to his untimely notice of appeal. <em>See United States v. Sherrill, </em>33 Fed.Appx. 90 (4th Cir.2002) (unpublished). The district court found that Sherrill had shown excusable neglect to justify the late filing. We remanded to the district court a second time for a determination as to whether Sherrill filed his motion for reconsideration within ten days of the entry of judgment. <em>See United States v. Sherrill, </em>71 Fed.Appx. 276 (4th Cir.2003) (unpublished). The district court has concluded that Sherrill submitted his motion for reconsideration within ten days of the entry of judgment. Because we do not find this factual determination clearly erroneous, <em>United States v. Gypsum, </em>333 U.S. 364, 395, 68 S.Ct. 525, 92 L.Ed. 746 (1948), we conclude that we have jurisdiction over Sherrill\u2019s appeal of both the underlying denial of Sherrill's \u00a7 2255 motion and the denial of his motion for reconsideration.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
