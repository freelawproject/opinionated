Specifically, the district court determined that Montero\u2019s arguments concerning President Bush\u2019s legitimacy and constitutional authority did not relate to the manner in which Montero\u2019s sentence was being carried out or to the determination of its duration.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-22\">Because Montero is not incarcerated in Texas, the district court lacked jurisdiction to entertain his petition pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241. <em>Lee v. Wetzel, </em>244 F.3d 370, 373-75 (5th Cir.2001) (ruling that \u201cthe district of incarceration is the only district that has jurisdiction to entertain a defendant\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition\u201d). Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is VACATED and the case is REMANDED with instructions to DISMISS Montero\u2019s 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 petition without prejudice for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-23\">VACATED AND REMANDED with instructions.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b936-36\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
