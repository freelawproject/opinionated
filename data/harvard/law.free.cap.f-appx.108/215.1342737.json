Roberts, federal prisoner # 03107-043, requests this court to grant him a certificate of appealability (COA) to appeal the district court\u2019s denial of his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion based on the successive nature of the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-25\">A COA motion may be granted only if the movant makes a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2). When the district court denies federal habeas relief on procedural grounds and does not reach the underlying constitutional claim, \u201ca COA should issue ... [if] the prisoner shows, at least, that jurists of reason would find it debatable whether the petition states a valid claim of the denial of a constitutional right and that jurists of reason would find it debatable whether the district court was correct in its procedural ruling.\u201d <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b243-26\">The district court did not notify Roberts of its intent to treat the audita querela motion as a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion and did not afford Roberts the opportunity to withdraw the motion or to amend it to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>include all of his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 claims. Thus, Roberts\u2019 prior motion does not constitute his first 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion precluding the filing of another motion based on its being successive in nature. <em>See Castro v. United States, </em>540 U.S. 375, 124 S.Ct. 786, 789, 792, 157 L.Ed.2d 778 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b244-4\">Accordingly, we GRANT Roberts COA on the issue whether the district court erred in denying Roberts\u2019 motion as successive, VACATE the district court\u2019s denial of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 relief, and REMAND to the district court for consideration of the merits of the 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>See Dickinson v. Wainwright, </em>626 F.2d 1184, 1186 (5th Cir.1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">Roberts motion to proceed in forma pauperis on appeal is GRANTED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b243-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
