However, Chiang did not file a petition for review within 30 days after the BIA dismissed his appeal. Thus, this court has no jurisdiction to review that decision. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(1), (b)(1) (2000); <em>Karimian-Kaklaki v. INS, </em>997 F.2d 108, 111 (5th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b915-10\">Chiang challenges the BIA\u2019s finding that he received oral notice of the removal hearing. In ruling on the reconsideration motion, the BIA stated that even assuming that Chiang did not have oral notice, his failure to appear was the result of his own inaction, not that of his attorney. Thus, the BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying reconsideration of whether Chiang received oral notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-11\">Chiang also challenges the BIA\u2019s finding that Chiang could go to attorney Tung Lam\u2019s office to file a change-of-venue motion upon his release from custody. Whether Chiang had or was refused Lam\u2019s address was not a factor in the BIA\u2019s decision to deny reconsideration. The BIA determined that because Chiang knew in April 2001 that Lam had abandoned him and because Chiang did not file a change of address with the IJ, Chiang should have contacted the IJ for information about his hearing. Thus, the BIA concluded that Chiang\u2019s failure to appear at the removal hearing was not the result of exceptional circumstances out of Chiang\u2019s control. The BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying reconsideration of whether Chiang had Lam\u2019s office address.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-16\">Citing <em>Ogbemudia v. INS, </em>988 F.2d 595 (5th Cir.1993), Chiang asserts that in determining that he should have inquired independently regarding the hearing date after his April 2001 phone conversation with Lam\u2019s office, the BIA should have considered that Chiang had not been educated in the United States, was illiterate in English, had no knowledge of removal proceedings, had only an elementary education in China, had only been in the United States for four months, had no relatives in the United States to give any help, and did not know the sponsor for his release from detention which Lam had provided. Although these may be factors the BIA could have considered in determining whether Chiang should have inquired independently about his hearing date, <em>Ogbemudia </em>does not establish factors which the BIA was required to consider. Accordingly, Chiang has shown no legal error.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-17\">Chiang also asserts that he filed an asylum application with his motion to reopen, and the BIA has \u201ccompletely ignored\u201d this application. This assertion is spurious. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"888\">*888</page-number>Chiang attached his asylum application to his motion to reopen, and the IJ notified Chiang that his asylum motion had not been filed properly.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-4\">Chiang has failed to show that the BIA abused its discretion by denying his motion to reconsider. <em>See Lam v. Trominski, </em>216 F.3d 487, 496 (5th Cir.2000). Accordingly, the petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b915-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
