For the reasons discussed below, we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-26\">Taye asserts that his evidence established past persecution, and that the resulting presumption of a well-founded fear of future persecution was sufficient to establish his eligibility for asylum. According to his testimony before the immigration judge, however, Taye did not establish both past persecution on a protected ground and that he was unable or unwilling to return to that country owing to that persecution, as required in 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.13(b)(1) (2004). Taye testified that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"801\">*801</page-number>he came to this country for medical treatment and fully intended to return to Ethiopia. Therefore, he is entitled to no presumption of a well-founded fear of future persecution, and his remaining evidence does not satisfy his burden of proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-5\">Accordingly, we deny the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-6\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
