Reuther, individually and on behalf the shareholders of the above-referenced corporations (the Corporations), appeals from the district court\u2019s grant of the appellees\u2019 motions for summary judgment in this suit alleging, among other claims, violations under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO). Because Reuther declines to renew his federal securities law claim, that issue is deemed abandoned. <em>See Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b941-21\">Reuther contends that the district court abused its discretion in denying his Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(f) request for a continuance to permit further discovery. He also asserts that the district court erred in granting summary judgment on his RICO claim. For purposes of the latter argument, Reuther contends that the district court improperly weighed evidence and decided genuine issues of material fact when rejecting certain alleged RICO predicate acts of mail fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-22\">We have reviewed the record and briefs submitted by the parties and hold that the district court\u2019s denial of Reuther\u2019s Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(f) request did not constitute an abuse of discretion since Reuther failed to show how the additional requested discovery would create a genuine issue of materi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"914\">*914</page-number>al fact. <em>See Richardson v. Henry, </em>902 F.2d 414, 417 (5th Cir.1990); <em>International Shortstop, Inc. v. Rally\u2019s, Inc., </em>939 F.2d 1257, 1266 (5th Cir.1991). Similarly, because Reuther\u2019s RICO predicate acts/mail fraud arguments fail to identify the existence of a material fact issue for trial, the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment is AFFIRMED. <em>See Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, </em>477 U.S. 317, 322-23, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986); <em>Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, </em>477 U.S. 242, 250, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986). Because the district court\u2019s summary judgment ruling was not error, we reject Reuther\u2019s request seeking reinstatement of his state-law claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b941-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
