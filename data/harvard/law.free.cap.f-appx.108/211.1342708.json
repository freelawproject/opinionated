Chambers argues that the arresting officer, Border Patrol agent Cipriano Amaro Jr., did not have reasonable suspicion of criminal activity sufficient to order the stop of Chambers\u2019s vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-4\">Amaro, an experienced agent, stopped a vehicle traveling near the border that was driven by an unfamiliar person, appeared to have recently crossed the border river, and that was carrying several spare tires, a method of transporting contraband known to Amaro. Thus, the totality of the circumstances show that Amaro had a reasonable suspicion that criminal activity was occurring. <em>See United States v. Neufeld-Neufeld, </em>338 F.3d 374, 378 (5th Cir.2003). Accordingly, the district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b239-40\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
