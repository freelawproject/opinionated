To obtain reversal of a determination denying eligibility for relief, an alien \u201cmust show that the evidence he presented was so compelling that no reasonable factfinder could fail to find the requisite fear of persecution.\u201d <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 483-84, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992). We have reviewed the evidence of record and conclude that the Pandeys fail to show that the evidence compels a contrary result. Accordingly, we cannot grant the relief that they seek.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-27\">Additionally, we uphold the immigration judge\u2019s denial of their requests for withholding of removal. The standard for withholding of removal is more stringent than that for granting asylum. <em>Chen v. INS, </em>195 F.3d 198, 205 (4th Cir.1999). To qualify for withholding of removal, an applicant must demonstrate \u201ca clear probability of persecution.\u201d <em>INS v. Cardoza-Fonseca, </em>480 U.S. 421, 430, 107 S.Ct. 1207, 94 L.Ed.2d 434 (1987). Because the Pan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"802\">*802</page-number>deys fail to show that they axe eligible for asylum, they cannot meet the higher standard for withholding of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-4\">We also find that Mrs. Pandey fails to meet the standard for relief under the Convention Against Torture. To obtain such relief, an applicant must establish that \u201cit is more likely than not that he or she would be tortured if removed to the proposed country of removal.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.16(c)(2) (2004). We find that Mrs. Pandey fails to make the requisite showing.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-5\">Accordingly, we deny the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-6\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
