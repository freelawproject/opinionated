To the extent the district court found that Williams failed to establish a violation of his constitutional rights, we affirm on the reasoning of the district court. <em>See Williams v. Angelone, </em>2003 WL 23312780 (W.D.Va.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b122-12\">The district court relied on its decision in <em>Madison v. Riter, </em>240 F.Supp.2d 566 (W.D.Va.2003), to deny Williams relief under \u00a7 1983 based on his RLUIPA claims. After the district court entered judgment in Williams\u2019s action, this Court reversed the district court\u2019s holding in <em>Madison </em>on December 8, 2003. <em>Madison v. Riter, </em>355 F.3d 310 (4th Cir.2003). Accordingly, we vacate the district court\u2019s order denying Williams\u2019s RLUIPA claims and remand those claims to the district court for further proceedings. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the material before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-14\">\n<em>AFFIRMED IN PART, VACATED IN PART, AND REMANDED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
