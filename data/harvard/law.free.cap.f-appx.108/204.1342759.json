The district court sentenced him to 88 months in prison and a three-year term of supervised release. Fuentes-Villarreal argues on appeal that the district court erred in denying his motion to dismiss the indictment based on an alleged violation of his Sixth Amendment right to a speedy trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-22\">Fuentes-Villarreal has not shown that the district court erred in denying his motion. Fuentes-Villarreal has not shown that he is entitled to a presumption of prejudice in connection with the delay between his indictment and prosecution, nor has he shown actual prejudice arising from this delay. <em>See United States v. Serna-Villarreal, </em>352 F.3d 225, 230 (5th Cir.2003), ce<em>rt. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 124 S.Ct. 1896, 158 L.Ed.2d 481 (2004). Accordingly, the district court\u2019s denial of Fuentes-Villarreal\u2019s motion to dismiss is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b232-20\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
