Guajardo filed his motion in the underlying class action litigation after the class plaintiffs had noticed their appeal from the district court\u2019s final judgment terminating the pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"850\">*850</page-number>spective relief afforded by a consent decree pursuant to provisions of the Prison Litigation Reform Act (PLRA). <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3626. This court subsequently affirmed the district court\u2019s judgment. <em>See Guajardo v. Texas Dept. of Criminal Justice, </em>363 F.3d 392 (5th Cir.2004), <em>petition for cert. filed, </em>(U.S. June 11, 2004) (No. 03-1663).</p>\n<p id=\"b878-4\">\u201cThis circuit follows the general rule that the filing of a valid notice of appeal from a final order of the district court divests that court of jurisdiction to act on the matters involved in the appeal, except to aid the appeal, correct clerical errors, or enforce its judgment so long as the judgment has not been stayed or superseded.\u201d <em>Avoyelles Sportsmen\u2019s League, Inc. v. Marsh, </em>715 F.2d 897, 928 (5th Cir.1983). Guajardo\u2019s brief nominally advances seven arguments. However, even according his filing the benefit of liberal construction, we are able to ascertain only four distinct contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-5\">Guajardo\u2019s argument that the district court could not terminate the consent decree because it was a contract is an attack on the underlying judgment terminating the consent decree, rather than a jurisdictional argument, and it does not show error on the part of the district in denying Guajardo\u2019s motion for lack of jurisdiction. In any event, given the termination provisions of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3626, Guajardo\u2019s argument is without merit. <em>See Agostini v. Felton, </em>521 U.S. 203, 215, 117 S.Ct. 1997, 138 L.Ed.2d 391 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b878-6\">Guajardo argues that the consent decree remained in effect during the pendency of the appeal from the district court\u2019s termination of the consent decree. His contention fails because no party sought a stay of the district court\u2019s final judgment terminating the consent decree. <em>See United States v. City of Alexandria, </em>614 F.2d 1358, 1361 (5th Cir.1980); Fed. R.Crv.P. 62(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b878-7\">Because the district court\u2019s final judgment was not stayed, and because the judgment put an end to all prospective relief afforded by the decree, any distinction between \u201ctermination\u201d and \u201cvacatur\u201d of the consent decree is without legal significance. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3626(b)(2), (7), (9). Finally, we reject Guajardo\u2019s contention that the district court had jurisdiction over his motion pursuant to the All Writs Act. <em>See Williams v. McKeithen, </em>939 F.2d 1100, 1104 (5th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b878-8\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b877-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
