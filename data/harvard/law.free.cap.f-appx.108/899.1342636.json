The pleading does not allege action necessarily legislative in nature, as the district judge explained.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b928-7\">2. The pleading alleges an uncompensated taking without notice to benefit someone other than for a public purpose.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b928-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b928-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
