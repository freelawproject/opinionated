Glatzer appeals from the dismissal of his 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 complaint alleging that the defendants conspired to deprive him of his parental rights. Glatzer alleged that Thomason, while acting as a temporary judge, conspired with his ex-wife and issued without jurisdiction an order in California proceedings affecting custody and child support. He further alleged that the defendants improperly seized his assets in New York based on the order. Glatzer sought damages and an injunction to stay separate proceedings that he initiated in New York state court. The district court dismissed the suit under the <em>Rooker-Feldman</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>doctrine as a collateral attack on the California order. In the alternative, to the extent that state court proceedings were still pending, the district court dismissed the suit based on the <em>Younger</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>abstention doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-9\">Glatzer argues that the district court\u2019s application of the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine was erroneous because the California order was jurisdietionally void and his claims are based on the defendants\u2019 independent constitutional violations. We conclude after reviewing the record and the briefs that Glatzer\u2019s claims are inextricably intertwined with the state court order and the district court did not err. <em>See United States v. Shepherd, </em>23 F.3d 923, 924 (5th Cir.1994); <em>Liedtke v. State Bar of Texas, </em>18 F.3d 315, 317 (5th Cir.1994). Glatzer also argues that the district court erroneously applied the <em>Younger </em>abstention doctrine. We conclude, however, that the district court\u2019s alternative ruling was correct. <em>See Pennzoil Co. v. Texaco, Inc., </em>481 U.S. 1, 14, 107 S.Ct. 1519, 95 L.Ed.2d 1 (1987); <em>Wightman v. Texas Supreme Court, </em>84 F.3d 188, 189 (5th Cir.1996). Thomason\u2019s motion to file a sur-reply brief and Glatzer\u2019s motion to file a sur-sur-reply brief are DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-13\">AFFIRMED; ALL OUTSTANDING MOTIONS DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b233-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
