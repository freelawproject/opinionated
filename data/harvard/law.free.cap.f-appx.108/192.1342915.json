Summers pleaded guilty but reserved the right to appeal the denial of a motion to suppress evidence obtained at a traffic stop of the car in which he was riding and the right to appeal an incorrect application of the sentencing guidelines. Summers contends that the stop was unjustified in its inception and was unlawfully extended in its scope; he also contends that he should have received an additional one point reduction for acceptance of responsibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-16\">The district court did not commit clear error by believing the testimony of the arresting officer that he stopped the car because of the driver\u2019s failure to signal before turning. Hence, the traffic stop was justified at its inception. <em>See Whren v. United States, </em>517 U.S. 806, 810, 116 S.Ct. 1769, 135 L.Ed.2d 89 (1996) (stop is reasonable if police have probable cause to believe traffic violation has occurred); <em>United States v. Garza, </em>118 F.3d 278, 283 (5th Cir.1997) (deferring to district court\u2019s findings as to credibility of witnesses), <em>cert. denied sub nom. Innocenio v. United States, </em>522 U.S. 1051, 118 S.Ct. 699, 139 L.Ed.2d 643 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b221-17\">Nor was the scope of the stop unlawfully extended. There was \u201cadditional articulable, reasonable suspicion\u201d for the detention. <em>See United States v. Valadez, </em>267 F.3d 395, 398 (5th Cir.2001). The officer was writing a citation to the vehicle\u2019s driver, James Baird, for failure to provide adequate proof of insurance. <em>See United States v. Shabazz, </em>993 F.2d 431, 437 (5th Cir.1993) (officer may request insurance papers and issue citation). The officers also had a reasonable suspicion about Summers\u2019 identity. Unlike the driver, Summers did not produce a driver\u2019s license or other photographic identification. Summers was riding in a car registered to Raymond Turner, and a man by that name was wanted on a felony arrest warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-18\">Summers received a two-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3El.l(a) but contends that he should have received an additional reduction under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3El.l(b).
