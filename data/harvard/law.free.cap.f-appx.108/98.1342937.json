Henley appeals from the judgment of the district court convicting him of possession with intent to distribute crack cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841 (2000), and possession of a firearm in furtherance of a drug trafficking crime, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1) (2000). Henley claims that the court erred in denying his motion to suppress. Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-17\">This court reviews the district court\u2019s factual findings underlying a motion to suppress for clear error, and the district court\u2019s legal determinations de novo. <em>Ornelas v. United States, </em>517 U.S. 690, 699, 116 S.Ct. 1657, 134 L.Ed.2d 911 (1996); <em>United States v. Rusher, </em>966 F.2d 868, 873 (4th Cir.1992). When a suppression motion has been denied, this court reviews the evidence in the light most favorable to the government. <em>See United States v. Seidman, </em>156 F.3d 542, 547 (4th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b127-18\">Henley first claims that the district court erred in concluding that his encounter with Officer Christopher Gleason of the Richmond Police Department did not amount to an illegal seizure in violation of the Fourth Amendment. Our review of the record supports the district court\u2019s conclusion. During the entire encounter, the officers never impeded Henley\u2019s movement, threatened him, or subjected him to any other kind of coercion. In fact, at least one other individual walked away from the officer despite the officer\u2019s request to speak with him. Therefore, the district court correctly determined that no seizure occurred because, under the totality of the circumstances, a reasonable person would believe that he was free to leave the encounter. <em>See Florida v. Bostick, </em>501 U.S. 429, 436-37, 111 S.Ct. 2382, 115 L.Ed.2d 389 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b127-19\">Next, Henley argues that his consent to search was not voluntary but the product of police coercion. Our review of the record supports the district court\u2019s conclusion. No credible evidence was introduced at the suppression hearing that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>suggested that the officers used coercive tactics to gain Henley\u2019s consent. In fact, Henley complied to Officer Gleason\u2019s request without protest and did not hesitate to proceed with the search. The district court did not clearly err in finding that Henley\u2019s consent to search was voluntary under the totality of the circumstances. <em>See Schneckloth v. Bustamonte, </em>412 U.S. 218, 223, 93 S.Ct. 2041, 36 L.Ed.2d 854 (1973); <em>Bumper v. North Carolina, </em>391 U.S. 543, 548, 88 S.Ct. 1788, 20 L.Ed.2d 797 (1968); <em>United States v. Analla, </em>975 F.2d 119, 125 (4th Cir.1992); <em>United States v. Gordon, </em>895 F.2d 932, 938 (4th Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b128-4\">Accordingly, we find that the district court did not clearly err in denying Henley\u2019s motion to suppress. <em>See Ornelas, </em>517 U.S. at 699, 116 S.Ct. 1657. We affirm the judgment of the district court. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
