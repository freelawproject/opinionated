(\u201cTorres\u201d) is a Spanish wine maker that has sold wine in the United States under the trademarks CORONAS and GRAN CORONAS for over 30 years. In 1985, Torres obtained a certificate of federal registration for each mark. The CORONAS mark consists of the word \u201cCoronas\u201d in stylized lettering below a logo that features three crowns in its design. The GRAN CORONAS is registered in stylized form without a superimposed logo.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-15\">In 1987, appellee Cantine Mezzacorona, S.C.A.R.L. (\u201cCantine\u201d), an Italian wine producer, began selling its wine in the United States under the mark Mezzacorona. In 1992, Cantine applied for registration of its Mezzacorona mark, which featured stylized lettering of the word Mezzacorona incorporated into a simple design.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-16\">The parties stipulated to a great many facts in this case. The word \u201ccorona\u201d means crown in both the Spanish and Italian languages. The words \u201cgran\u201d and \u201cmezza\u201d are size designations. \u201cGran\u201d means grand or large in Spanish and Italian; \u201cmezza\u201d means half in Italian.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-17\">The parties have similar chains-of-distribution for their wines. Torres sells its CORONAS and GRAN CORONAS wines to Paterno Imports Limited, its importer in the United States. Paterno, in turn, sells the wines to regional distributors that distribute the wines to local restaurants <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"818\">*818</page-number>and retail wine vendors. Cantine distributes its Mezzacorona wines in the United States through Prestige Wine Imports Corporation, which sells to regional distributors who, in turn, sell to local restaurants and retail wine vendors. Torres does not advertise its CORONAS or GRAN CORONAS wines through print media. Cantine, by contrast, has paid to advertise Mezzacorona wines in magazines such as <em>The Wine Spectator </em>and <em>The Wine Enthusiast. </em>Otherwise, the parties employ identical methods of product promotion, including wine tastings, trade shows, and point-of-sale product information.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-4\">In 1992, Cantine applied for registration of the Mezzacorona mark in stylized form for use with its wines. Initially, the United States Patent and Trademark Office (\u201cPTO\u201d) refused registration on the grounds that Cantine\u2019s proposed mark was \u201clikely to be confused\u201d with the CORONAS and GRAN CORONAS marks previously registered by Torres. J.A. 1577. Cantine, however, successfully sought reconsideration of the PTO\u2019s initial decision by suggesting that \u201ccrown\u201d or \u201ccorona\u201d is commonly used in connection with wines for purposes of International Class 33 registrations. Accordingly, the PTO issued a notice of publication that the mark Mezzacorona was entitled to registration.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-5\">Torres, which is engaged with Cantine in trademark disputes outside of the United States, filed an opposition based on its prior use and registration of the CORONAS and GRAN CORONAS marks. After receiving briefs and holding an opposition hearing, the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board (TTAB) concluded that \u201cthe use of [Cantine\u2019s] mark is likely to cause confusion, mistake or deception\u201d and that the mark thus was not entitled to registration. J.A. 29. The TTAB\u2019s analysis focused on two considerations \u2014 \u201cthe similarity of the goods and the similarity of the marks.\u201d J.A. 26. The TTAB explained that \u201c[i]n Board proceedings, \u2018the question of likelihood of confusion must be determined based on an analysis of the mark as applied to the goods and/or services recited in applicant\u2019s application visa-vis the goods and/or services recited in opposer\u2019s registration, rather than what the evidence shows the goods and/or services to be.\u2019 \u201d J.A. 26-27 (quoting <em>Canadian Imperial Bank v. Wells Fargo Bank, </em>811 F.2d 1490 (Fed.Cir.1987)). Moreover, the TTAB \u201cpresume[s] that [the goods at issue] travel in the same channels of trade and that they are purchased by the same end users\u201d if the application itself does not distinguish the goods from those associated with the senior registered mark. J.A. 27. Focusing on the \u201cvisual appearance, pronunciation and connotation\u201d of the opposing marks and the fact that the opposing marks were to be used in the sale of wine, the TTAB agreed with Torres that Cantine\u2019s Mezzacorona mark was not entitled to registration. J.A. 29.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-8\">Cantine then sought review of the TTAB decision in the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. <em>See </em>15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1071(a).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Concluding that none of the TTAB\u2019s factual findings regarding the similarity of the marks or the accompanying goods were clearly erroneous, the Federal Circuit held that the TTAB decision was correct:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b846-9\">We cannot find fault with the Board\u2019s factual determinations that the mark Cantine sought to register was similar in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"819\">*819</page-number>physical appearance, sound, and meaning to the marks registered to Torres, whether the marks are considered as applied for or registered, or as actually used.... We conclude, therefore, that the Board\u2019s decision to grant the opposition and deny Cantine\u2019s registration because its mark was confusingly similar to two previously-registered marks was correct as a matter of law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b847-5\"><em>Cantine Mezzacorona v. Torres, </em>No. 97-1339, at 5-6, 1997 WL 786911 (Fed.Cir.Dec. 17,1997) (unpublished).</p>\n<p id=\"b847-6\">Although Cantine was unable to secure registration of the Mezzacorona mark, it continued to sell its wine varieties under the mark. Accordingly, in January 1998, Torres brought this trademark infringement action under the Lanham Act. <em>See </em>15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1114. Torres also alleged unfair competition, <em>see </em>15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1125, and common law trademark infringement and unfair competition under Virginia law. In addition to damages, Torres sought injunctive relief and attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-7\">In March 1998, Torres moved for summary judgment based on a collateral estoppel theory, arguing that Cantine was bound by the administrative decision upheld by the Federal Circuit that the Mezzacorona mark was not registrable because it was likely to cause confusion with the CORONAS and GRAN CORONAS marks. In an order dated April 16, 1998, the district court denied the motion for two reasons. First, one of the defendants in the infringement action, Prestige Wine Imports, was not a party to the proceedings before the TTAB. Second, the district court concluded that \u201cthe issue for which [Torres] seeks preclusive effect is not identical to the issue actually decided in the prior adjudication.\u201d J.A. 48. The district court explained that \u201c[i]n infringement actions, instead of focusing on the trademarks as they appear in the registration or proposed registration, the issue is whether the actual use of the trademarks is likely to cause confusion.\u201d J.A. 49. The district court did not believe that the TTAB or the Federal Circuit undertook the type of \u201cmeaningful analysis of the marks in their entire marketplace context\u201d that would entitle the administrative findings to preclusive effect in a trademark infringement action. J.A. 51.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-10\">Subsequently, the parties filed cross motions for summary judgment. The district court concluded that \u201cthere is no likelihood of confusion between Plaintiffs and Defendants\u2019 marks, and that summary judgment in favor of the Defendants is appropriate.\u201d J.A. 1937. In so ruling, the district court applied the multifactor test followed in this circuit:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b847-11\">To ascertain the likelihood of confusion between two trademarks, we consider ... (1) the distinctiveness of the senior mark; (2) the similarity of the two marks; (3) the similarity of the goods and services that the marks identify; (4) the similarity of the facilities employed by the parties to transact their business; (5) the similarity of the advertising used by the parties; (6) the defendant\u2019s intent in adopting the same or similar mark; and (7) actual confusion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b847-12\"><em>Sara Lee Corp. v. Kayser-Roth Corp., </em>81 F.3d 455, 463 (4th Cir.1996) (quoting <em>Pizzeria Uno Corp. v. Temple, </em>747 F.2d 1522, 1527 (4th Cir.1984)). The district court considered the record before it in light of each of these factors, as well as a few additional factors that we have found to be appropriate in a trademark infringement analysis.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Although the district court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"820\">*820</page-number>thoroughly considered the evidence before it under most of the relevant factors, its analysis was deficient in one respect. In considering the \u201csimilarity of the two marks\u201d factor, the district court apparently did not consider the factual findings of the TTAB.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-4\">We cannot agree with Torres, however, that the TTAB\u2019s findings are presumptively correct or entitled to some sort of deference, as they might be if the district court were actually reviewing the TTAB\u2019s findings pursuant to an action under 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1071(b).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> As the district court ably pointed out in rejecting Torres\u2019s collateral estoppel argument, the \u201clikelihood of confusion\u201d analysis employed in a TTAB proceeding is different than the \u201clikelihood of confusion\u201d analysis employed in a full-blown infringement action. <em>See Levy v. Kosher Overseers Ass\u2019n of America, Inc., </em>104 F.3d 38, 41 (2d Cir.1997). The key to whether any controlling effect is due in an infringement action is whether \u201cthe TTAB or the Federal Circuit ... have taken into account, in a meaningful way, the <em>context </em>of the marketplace.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 42. Here, the TTAB considered facts relevant only to a portion of the full multi-factor infringement analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-5\">Nonetheless, a district court cannot altogether omit consideration of the TTAB\u2019s factual determinations that are relevant to a given factor in the infringement analysis. At the very least, such findings should be considered \u201cpowerful <em>evidence\u201d </em>of the presence (or lack thereof) of one or more of the factors that must be considered in an infringement action. <em>Cf. America Online, Inc. v. AT &amp; T Corp., </em>243 F.3d 812, 817 (4th Cir.2001) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b848-6\">Although the TTAB\u2019s analysis of whether Cantine\u2019s mark was \u201clikely to cause confusion\u201d was not sufficient to settle the infringement question, it engaged in more than a cursory analysis with respect to whether the marks were visually similar or similar in terms of pronunciation. Given the agency expertise of the TTAB, these findings are evidence that is entitled to \u201cdue respect\u201d from the district court, <em>see Pizzeria Uno, </em>747 F.2d at 1528 (internal quotation marks omitted), in its analysis of the \u201csimilarity of the two marks\u201d factor. \u201cDue respect\u201d obligates the district court to give explicit and meaningful consideration to the bases underlying the TTAB\u2019s conclusion that the two marks were similar visually and in terms of pronunciation, and to the impact of these conclusions upon the district court\u2019s analysis of one or more of the nonexclusive factors set forth in <em>Sara Lee. </em>Because the matter was before the district court on summary judgment, we are constrained to return the matter for consideration of whether the TTAB findings of fact are sufficient to create an issue of material fact that would preclude summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-10\">By contrast, the TTAB\u2019s factual findings that the goods to which the marks were affixed were \u201cidentical\u201d and \u201ctraveled in the same channels of trade\u201d and \u201cpurchased by the same end users\u201d were based simply on the fact that Cantine\u2019s application set forth no limitation that would distinguish the goods. Because these findings are not grounded in evidence of actual use that is fundamental in infringement litigation, the district court was not obligated to accord them any special weight.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-11\">Thus, we vacate the decision of the district court and remand for further proceedings in light of this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-12\">\n<em>VACATED AND REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b846-6\">. Cantine also had the option of seeking direct review of the administrative decision by filing an action in district court, where the aggrieved party can introduce additional evidence and raise additional claims. <em>See </em>15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1071(b). The district court\u2019s decision is subject to review in the appropriate federal appellate court. Cantine, however, did not elect this option.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b847-8\">. The district court recognized that the following factors are sometimes relevant: \"the quality of the defendant's products\"; \"the sophistication of consumers\u201d; \"the proximity of the products as they are actually sold\u201d; and \"the probability that the senior mark owner will ... enter[ ] the defendant\u2019s market.\u201d J.A. 1919.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b848-7\">. Indeed, Torres has not appealed the district court's April 16, 1998, order rejecting its argument that the findings of the TTAB are entitled to preclusive effect. Thus, we could not address its argument in any event.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b849-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"821\">*821</page-number>WIDENER, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"ANL\">concurring and dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-5\">I concur in the vacation of the judgment of the district court and in the remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-6\">However, I respectfully dissent as to the action which the district court should take on remand.
