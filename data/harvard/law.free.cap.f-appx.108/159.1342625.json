The district court sentenced him to serve 82 months in prison and a four-year term of supervised release. La Spina filed a purported 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 petition to challenge these convictions. The district court determined that La Spina\u2019s purported 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 petition was best classed as a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion and dismissed it. La Spina now appeals that dismissal. La Spina also requests that his appeal be expeditiously considered. That request is DENIED. La Spina\u2019s motion to correct procedural error, which relates to this court\u2019s prior denial of his petition for a writ of mandamus, is likewise DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-6\">La Spina argues that the district court was without jurisdiction to construe his purported 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 petition as a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion. He also contends that the district court erred in dismissing his purported 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 petition. La Spina\u2019s arguments center primarily on the use of capital letters in various court documents, whether the district court is an Article III court, and whether his rights were violated when he received a \u201cjury trial,\u201d rather than a \u201ctrial by jury.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b188-7\">In reviewing the denial of habeas relief, the district court\u2019s findings of fact are reviewed for clear error and issues of law are reviewed <em>de novo. Jeffers v. Chandler, </em>253 F.3d 827, 830 (5th Cir.2001). La Spina has not shown that the district court erred in construing his pleading as a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion that should be dismissed or that the district court was without power to take this action. <em>See Tolliver v. Dobre, </em>211 F.3d 876, 877-78 (5th Cir.2000); <em>Cox v. Warden, Fed. Detention Ctr., 911 </em>F.2d 1111, 1113 (5th Cir.1990); <em>Solsona v. Warden, </em>821 F.2d 1129, 1132 (5th Cir.1987). Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-10\">The arguments presented in La Spina\u2019s filings with this court are wholly lacking in merit. La Spina is WARNED that future attempts to relitigate these arguments could result in sanctions. <em>See Coghlan v. Starkey, </em>852 F.2d 806, 817 (5th Cir.1988); <em>Farguson v. MBank Houston, N.A., </em>808 F.2d 358, 359 (5th Cir.1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b188-11\">JUDGMENT OF DISTRICT COURT AFFIRMED; ALL OUTSTANDING MOTIONS DENIED; SANCTIONS WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b188-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
