We have jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review an adverse credibility finding for substantial evidence, <em>Lata v. INS, </em>204 F.3d 1241, 1245 (9th Cir.2000), and we reverse only if the evidence compels a contrary conclusion, <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 483-84, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992). We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">Substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination, based on Singh\u2019s demeanor and inconsistencies that went to the heart of his claim. <em>See Singh-Kaur v. INS, </em>183 F.3d 1147, 1151-52 (9th Cir.1999). The record does not compel the opposite result. <em>See Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. at 483-84, 112 S.Ct. 812.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-6\">Because Singh did not testify credibly, he failed to establish eligibility for asylum. <em>See Mejia-Paiz v. INS, </em>111 F.3d 720, 723 (9th Cir.1997). It follows that he also failed to establish eligibility for withholding of removal. <em>See Alvarez-Santos v. INS, </em>332 F.3d 1245, 1255 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b541-7\">Substantial evidence also supports the IJ\u2019s conclusion that Singh is not entitled to relief under the Convention Against Torture because he did not demonstrate that it is more likely than not that he would be tortured upon return to India. <em>See Farah v. Ashcroft, </em>348 F.3d 1153, 1156-57 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b541-8\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b540-22\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
