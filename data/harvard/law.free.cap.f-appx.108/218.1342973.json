Smith, Mississippi prisoner #31733, appeals the district court\u2019s dismissal of his 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 complaint as untimely. This court reviews for abuse of discretion. <em>Gartrell v. Gaylor, </em>981 F.2d 254, 256 (5th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b246-28\">Smith\u2019s claims against Andrew Gambrell and Rex Jones arise from the proceedings leading to and surrounding his indictment, conviction, and sentence. His allegations of ineffective assistance and prosecutorial misconduct call into question the validity of his conviction, and Smith therefore must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>satisfy the conditions of <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 484-87, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994), before he can proceed in a civil rights action. Therefore, the dismissal of Smith\u2019s claims against Gambrell and Jones is AFFIRMED, but the judgment is AMENDED to state that the claims are DISMISSED WITH PREJUDICE to their being asserted again until the <em>Heck </em>conditions are met. <em>Johnson v. McElveen, </em>101 F.3d 423, 424 (5th Cir.1996). Smith has not challenged the district court\u2019s conclusion that his claims affecting his eligibility for immediate release must be raised in habeas, and any such claim is deemed abandoned. <em>See Brinkmann v. Dallas County Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">Smith\u2019s claims against Lindsay Carter and Dewitt Allred arise out of postconviction proceedings in his case. Smith has not established that the district court abused its discretion in dismissing these claims as untimely. <em>See Gartrell, </em>981 F.2d at 256; Miss.Code Ann. \u00a7 15-1-49(1); <em>Hemphill-Weathers v. Farrish, </em>779 So.2d 167, 171 (Miss.Ct.App.2001). The judgment of the district court is therefore AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b246-29\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
