The district court dismissed her complaint, concluding that the narrow exceptions to Virginia\u2019s at-will employment doctrine did not apply in this case. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-11\">Rowan worked as an office manager and cashier at Tractor Supply\u2019s Christianburg, Virginia store. During her employment, Rowan discovered information that led her to believe that her manager, Jerry Snider, was embezzling money from the store. She also observed Snider displaying inappropriate intimacy with a subordinate at the store. When Rowan expressed her concerns about these matters to Snider, he reacted violently, pinning Rowan back against her desk and twisting her left arm. He then told Rowan that she would \u201cbe sorry\u201d if she went against him. The attack left Rowan with swelling and bruises that required medical treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-14\">The day after the attack, September 8, 1999, Rowan met with Rodney Carter, Snider\u2019s boss. Rowan alleges that Carter \u201cexpressed no concern for [her] or the fact that she had been attacked ... in the workplace\u201d and instead asked her whether she had told anyone else about the attack. Several days later, according to Rowan, another employee of Tractor Supply contacted her to tell her to \u201ckeep her mouth shut\u201d or she would \u201csuffer the consequences.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b139-15\">Rowan reported the attack to the police on September 11, and the Commonwealth of Virginia filed charges against Snider. At the suggestion of the police officer, Rowan filed a civil action against Snider. The civil claim came to trial in the General District Court of Montgomery County, and Rowan was awarded damages of $1500 plus interest and costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-16\">While the criminal charges were still pending, Snider was transferred to another Tractor Supply store, and Mike Jones took Snider\u2019s place as manager of the Christianburg store. According to Rowan, Jones told her that Tractor Supply wanted her to \u201cdrop\u201d the criminal charges against Snider, and that if she complied, she would not be \u201cblack-balled\u201d by the company anymore.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Rowan told Jones that she could not, and in any event would not, drop the criminal charges. Jones told her that she \u201cshould not play around with Rodney Carter because he was a dangerous and powerful person and could hurt [her].\u201d After this conversation, Rowan states that she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>experienced a number of mysterious and threatening events: the air was let out of her tires several times, prowlers crept around her porch at night, and someone killed her cat. Also, on February 16, 2000, a few weeks before the criminal trial against Snider, Tractor Supply terminated Rowan\u2019s employment. In Rowan\u2019s opinion, she was terminated because she refused to ask the Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney to drop the criminal charges against Snider.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-4\">Not to be intimidated, however, Rowan persisted in her course of action. On March 7, 2000, she testified in the criminal case against Snider, and he was convicted of criminal assault and battery by the General District Court of Montgomery County.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">On May 12, 2000, she also filed a two-count civil complaint against Tractor Supply in the Circuit Court for the City of Roanoke \u2014 one count for wrongful termination in violation of Virginia public policy, and one for retaliatory firing. Tractor Supply removed the case to federal court, based on diversity jurisdiction, and the parties later agreed to a dismissal of the retaliatory-firing count.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-6\">On Tractor Supply\u2019s motion for judgment on the pleadings and Rowan\u2019s motion to certify a question to the Virginia Supreme Court, the district court issued a Memorandum Opinion dated June 6, 2001. The court noted that \u201c[i]n general, Virginia adheres to the \u2018employment at will doctrine,\u2019\u201d wherein either party to an open-ended contract for services is at liberty to terminate the contract at will. However, in a line of cases beginning with <em>Bowman v. State Bank of Keysville, </em>229 Va. 534, 331 S.E.2d 797, 801 (Va.1985), the Virginia Supreme Court carved out a \u201cnarrow exception\u201d to this rule for cases where an employer violates an \u201cestablished public policy\u201d in discharging an employee. The district court then considered the five Virginia statutes whose public policy Rowan contended Tractor Supply violated in terminating her:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-8\">1. Va.Code \u00a7 18.2-460 (obstruction of justice), which prohibits using \u201cthreats or force ... to intimidate ... [a] witness ... or to obstruct or impede the administration of justice in any court.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-9\">2. Va.Code \u00a7 18.2-465.1, which prohibits employers from taking \u201cany adverse personnel action\u201d against an employee \u201cas a result of [the employee\u2019s] absence from employment due to ... [a] court appearance....\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-10\">3. Va.Code \u00a7 19.2-11.01(A), which requires the \u201ccrime victim and witness assistance program\u201d to advise witnesses about their rights, including those contained in \u00a7 18.2-465.1.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-11\">4. Va.Code \u00a7 19.2-267, which makes disobeying a witness summons in a criminal case a punishable offense.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-12\">5. Va.Code \u00a7 18.2-456, which enables courts to punish summarily, as contempt of court, disobedience to a court order.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AXX\">Setting aside the obstruction-of-justice statute, the district court first addressed the other four. The court found that \u00a7 18.2-465.1 and the related \u00a7 19.2-11.01(A) were inapplicable, because they were explicitly limited to terminations \u201cas a result of\u2019 an absence from work. The court noted that Rowan did not allege that she was terminated because she was planning to be absent from work, but rather because her employer (justifiably or not) did not like the fact that she was testifying against another of its employees. The court found that the statute\u2019s purpose was to protect witnesses from adverse employment action based on the fact of their having missed work to appear in court, not on the content of their testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-14\">The court then considered the final two statutes, \u00a7 19.2-267 and \u00a7 18.2-456 (making the disobedience of a subpoena an offense and enabling courts to punish such offenses summarily), and found that these <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>statutes were similarly irrelevant. Although Rowan had been issued a subpoena to testify at Snider\u2019s trial and it would have been a punishable offense had she simply failed to show up on the appointed day, Rowan did not allege that her employer asked her to disobey the subpoena. Rather, her supervisor asked her to \u201cdrop\u201d the charges \u2014 or in more precise terms, to ask the Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney to drop the charges. This proposed course of action is quite distinct from disobeying the subpoena by failing to attend court, if the charges were still pending. Therefore, the district court found that these statutes could not ground Rowan\u2019s <em>Bowman </em>claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-5\">The district court then turned to Rowan\u2019s claim that by terminating her, Tractor Supply violated the public policy behind the obstruction-of-justiee statute. The district court concluded that the precedent on this question was inscrutable, and therefore it granted Rowan\u2019s motion to certify to the Virginia Supreme Court the following question: \u201cDoes a complaint state a <em>Bowman </em>claim under \u00a7 18.2-460 [obstruction of justice] when the plaintiff, an at-will employee, alleges that her employer terminated her employment because she refused to yield to employer\u2019s demand that she discontinue pursuing criminal charges of assault and battery against a fellow employee?\u201d The Virginia Supreme Court answered this question in the negative, concluding in <em>Rowan v. Tractor Supply Co., </em>268 Va. 209, 559 S.E.2d 709 (Va.2002), that the public policy behind the obstruction-of-justice statute is \u201cnot to protect <em>individuals </em>from intimidation, but to protect the public from a flawed legal system due to impaired prosecution of criminals.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 712 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b141-6\">In light of the Virginia Supreme Court\u2019s answer to the certified question, as well as the conclusions that the district court had reached in its Memorandum Opinion of June 6, 2001, the district court granted Tractor Supply\u2019s motion for judgment on the pleadings in a Final Order dated April 19, 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-9\">On appeal, we have reviewed the record carefully and considered the arguments of counsel made in their briefs and at oral argument. For the reasons fully set forth by the district court in <em>Rowan v. Tractor Supply Co., </em>Civil Action No. 7:00CV00467 (W.D.Va. June 6, 2001), and in <em>Rowan v. Tractor Supply Co., </em>Civil Action No. 7:00CV00467 (W.D.Va. Apr. 19, 2002), we affirm the judgment of the district court.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b141-10\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b139-12\">. Jones appears to have believed that the victim of a crime brings charges against a defendant and can \"drop\u201d them at any time. In reality, of course, even a personal crime like assault is an offense against the Commonwealth, and criminal charges may be dropped only upon motion of the Commonwealth and at the discretion of the court. <em>See </em>Va.Code Ann. \u00a7 19.2-265.3. In practical terms, however, this misperception has some truth in the sense that a victim is usually the star witness in a criminal case, and without that witness' cooperation, the Commonwealth will sometimes decline to prosecute the case. As the district court noted, therefore, Jones\u2019s request that Rowan \"drop\u201d the criminal charges must be taken as a request that she ask the Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney to do so.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b141-7\">. We also decline Rowan\u2019s invitation to certify to the Virginia Supreme Court the questions not certified to that court in the earlier certification order.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
