Kinch seeks to appeal the district court\u2019s orders dismissing his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 petition as untimely and denying a certificate of appealability. We dismiss the appeal in No. 04-6445 for lack of jurisdiction because the notice of appeal was not timely filed and dismiss the appeal in 04-6772 because Kinch does not meet the certificate of appealability requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-24\">Parties are accorded thirty days after the entry of the district court\u2019s final judgment or order to note an appeal, Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(1)(A), unless the district court extends the appeal period under Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(5) or reopens the appeal period under Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(6). This appeal period is \u201cmandatory and jurisdictional.\u201d <em>Browder v. Director, Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>434 U.S. 257, 264, 98 S.Ct. 556, 54 L.Ed.2d 521 (1978) (quoting <em>United States v. Robinson, </em>361 U.S. 220, 229, 80 S.Ct. 282, 4 L.Ed.2d 259 (1960)). The district court\u2019s order was entered on the docket on September 8, 2003. The notice of appeal was signed on February 23, 2004, and filed on February 26, 2004. Because Kinch failed to file a timely notice of appeal or to obtain an extension or reopening of the appeal period, we dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-25\">An appeal may not be taken from the final order in a habeas corpus proceeding unless a circuit justice or judge issues a certificate of appealability. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1) (2000). A certificate of appealability will not issue absent \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2) (2000). A prisoner satisfies this standard by demonstrating that reasonable jurists would find that his constitutional claims are debatable and that any dispositive procedural <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>rulings by the district court are also debatable or wrong. <em>See Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 336, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003). We have independently reviewed the record and conclude that Kinch has not made the requisite showing. Accordingly, we deny a certificate of appealability and dismiss the appeal of the district court\u2019s order denying a certificate of appealability.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-4\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">\n<em>DISMISSED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
