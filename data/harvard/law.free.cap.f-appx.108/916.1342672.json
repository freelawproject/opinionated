McDonald also asserts that the court was not authorized to order the immediate payment of restitution as a condition of supervised release under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3588 because his term of supervised release had not yet commenced. However, the district court considered McDonald\u2019s assets, earnings, and financial obligations when it scheduled the payment of restitution, and McDonald has not shown any error in the court\u2019s restitution order. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3664(f)(2); <em>United States v. Howard, </em>220 F.3d 645, 647 (5th Cir.2000); <em>United States v. Myers, </em>198 F.3d 160, 169 (5th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b945-5\">McDonald also argues that the district court erred in ordering that he pay restitution to one victim for expenses related to his nonmandatory attendance as an observer at court proceedings. The Mandatory Victims Restitution Act requires a defendant to \u201creimburse the victim for lost income and necessary child care, transportation, and other expenses incurred during participation in the investigation or prosecution of the offense or attendance at proceedings related to the offense.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3663A(b)(4). Under the plain language of the statute, the district court did not err in awarding restitution for the victim\u2019s court attendance. <em>See United States v. Morales-Palacios, </em>369 F.3d 442, 446 (5th Cir.2004); <em>see also United States v. Malpeso, </em>126 F.3d 92, 94-95 (2d Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b945-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b944-29\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
