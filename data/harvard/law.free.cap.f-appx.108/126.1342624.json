Lloyd\u2019s then brought this action in federal district court seeking recognition of its judgment as final and enforceable, entitled to full faith and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>credit in Texas. In a motion for nonrecognition of the foreign country judgment, Cohen asked the district court to find that service of process upon a \u201csubstitute agent\u201d in England was unacceptable and that he did not receive proper notice of the English law suit before suffering a default judgment. The district court denied the motion and enforced the default judgment against Cohen. Because Cohen agreed to submit to the jurisdiction of the courts of England, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-6\">The parties agree that the Uniform Foreign Money-Judgments Recognition Act, or Texas Recognition Act, governs whether the judgment will be enforced in Texas.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Act makes enforceable any \u201cforeign country judgment that is final and conclusive and enforceable where rendered.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Under the Texas Recognition Act, a foreign country judgment \u201cis not conclusive if ... the foreign country court did not have personal jurisdiction over the defendant.\u201d <footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b155-7\">Cohen\u2019s challenge to service of process is a challenge to personal jurisdiction.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The Society of Lloyd\u2019s served process on an entity in London called Additional Underwriting Agencies [No. 9], Ltd., or AUA9, as \u201csubstitute agent\u201d rather than on Mr. Cohen personally.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-16\">As part of a Reconstruction and Renewal Plan established to settle underwriting losses arising from toxic tort litigation, English legislation granted Lloyd\u2019s the authority to appoint AUA9 to sign a reinsurance contract on behalf of Cohen and other Names, binding them without their consent.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> AUA9 did enter into the reinsurance contract, called the Equitas contract, under which Cohen owes premiums.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-17\">Cohen challenges Lloyd\u2019s appointment of AUA9 as agent specifically for service of process.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The Equitas contract itself and not the enabling legislation is the purported source of Lloyd\u2019s right to appoint AUA9 as agent for service of process. That contract provided that each Name not domiciled in England</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-18\"><em>irrevocably appoints </em>[AUA9] <em>as agent to accept service </em>of any proceedings in the English courts on his behalf. If for any reason such agent shall cease to act as agent for service of process of any Name, that Name ... shall forthwith appoint a replacement agent, approved by ERL, in London.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b155-19\">Cohen wrote Lloyd\u2019s, however, advising that no person in England had authority to accept service of process on his behalf.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Cohen thus maintains that he terminated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>AUA9\u2019s authority as substitute agent for service.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-4\">When Cohen signed a General Undertaking to become a Name, he \u201cirrevocably agree[d] to submit to the jurisdiction of the courts of England.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> That agreement defeats his challenge to the foreign judgment based on a service-of-process objection to personal jurisdiction. The Texas Recognition Act states expressly, \u201cA court <em>may not refuse </em>to recognize a foreign country judgment for lack of personal jurisdiction if ... the defendant prior to the commencement of the proceedings had agreed <em>to submit to the jurisdiction of </em>the foreign country court with respect to the subject matter involved.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Since Cohen entered such an agreement before Lloyd\u2019s began the proceedings against him, the district court simply could not sustain Cohen\u2019s challenge to personal jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-6\">Cohen also challenges the notice provided him of the suit. The Texas Recognition Act provides the court discretion not to recognize a foreign country judgment if the defendant \u201cdid not receive notice of the proceedings in sufficient time to defend.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The district court determined that Cohen received adequate notice through the service of the agent because his attempted revocation of the agency was ineffective.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-12\">Relying on the Equitas contract provision quoted above, the court held that it was the agent AUA9 and not Cohen who had the right to revoke the agent\u2019s authority and that from Cohen\u2019s perspective, the appointment was irrevocable.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Accordingly, AUA9 remained Cohen\u2019s agent and through the agent, Cohen received sufficient notice of the proceedings. We discern no error in this holding and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-13\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-14\">Finding no error in the court\u2019s analysis on either point, we</p>\n<p id=\"b156-15\">AFFIRM.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b154-16\">.

Noting that the agency was created not for the benefit of the principle, Cohen, but for the benefit of another, Lloyd's, the court deemed the authority granted to the agent to be a \u201cpower given as security.\u201d Applying common law (Restatement of Agency) the court then noted that the revocability of an agency differs for the two: while an agency created for the benefit of the principle is revocable by the principle, the power given as security (not created for the benefit of the principle) is revocable only in accordance with the agreement by the which the power was created. The court held that the Equitas contract was the agreement by which the power was created and looked to that contract for the rights of revocation.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
