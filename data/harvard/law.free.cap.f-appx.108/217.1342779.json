Broadway was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 120 months to be followed by a three-year term of supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-8\">Broadway argues that the district court erred when it denied his motion to withdraw his guilty plea. This court accords broad discretion to the district court\u2019s decision regarding a motion to withdraw and will reverse such a decision only for an abuse of that discretion. <em>United States v. Carr, </em>740 F.2d 339, 343-44 (5th Cir.1984). The totality of the circumstances in this case indicates that Broadway has failed to demonstrate a fair and just reason for withdrawing his guilty plea. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b246-9\">The judgment of the district court is therefore AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b246-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
