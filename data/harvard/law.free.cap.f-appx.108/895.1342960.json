The appellants argue that their indictments were invalid because the underlying deportation orders, which were based on having been convicted of the felony driving while intoxicated, are invalid under <em>United States v. Chapa-Garza, </em>243 F.3d 921, 927 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b924-4\">The denial of a motion to dismiss an indictment is reviewed <em>de novo. United States v. Wilson, </em>249 F.3d 366, 371 (5th Cir.2001). To challenge the validity of an underlying deportation order, an alien must establish that: (1) the prior deportation hearing was fundamentally unfair; (2) the hearing effectively ehminated the alien\u2019s right to seek judicial review of the removal order; and (3) the procedural deficiencies caused actual prejudice. <em>United States v. Lopez-Vasquez, </em>227 F.3d 476, 483 (5th Cir.2000); 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b924-5\">The appellants fail to show that their deportation hearings were fundamentally unfair inasmuch as the hearings did not violate their procedural due process rights. <em>See United States v. Lopez-Ortiz, </em>313 F.3d 225, 230 (5th Cir.2002), <em>cert. denied, </em>537 U.S. 1135, 123 S.Ct. 922, 154 L.Ed.2d 827 (2003). The court need not reach the appellants\u2019 remaining arguments. <em>See Lopez-Ortiz, </em>313 F.3d at 231; <em>Lopez-Vasquez, </em>227 F.3d at 485. AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b923-30\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
