Godfrey and Louis, detectives with the narcotics division of the Kenner, Louisiana, Police Department, had previously arrested Carter for obscenity under La.Rev.Stat. Ann. \u00a7 14:106 (West 2004), but Carter was acquitted at trial. Carter has abandoned his remaining claims against Godfrey, Louis, and the City of Kenner. <em>See Brinkmann v. Dallas County Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b879-18\">We review a district court\u2019s award of summary judgment de novo. <em>Banks v. East Baton Rouge Parish Sch. Bd., </em>320 F.3d 570, 575 (5th Cir.2003). In <em>Castellano v. Fragozo, </em>352 F.3d 939, 945 (5th Cir.2003), we held that there is no <em>\u201cfreestanding </em>constitutional right to be free from malicious prosecution\u201d and that a 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 malicious prosecution claim must be based on a specific constitutional violation, rather than a violation of state law. Carter concedes that, in light of <em>Castellano, </em>he could not bring a malicious prosecution claim under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 but argues that the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment was nevertheless erroneous because he raised meritorious claims that he was arrested without probable cause under the Fourth Amendment and that Godfrey and Lewis violated his right to due process at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-19\">Carter does not challenge the district court\u2019s finding that, because he conceded he was in his yard with his pants open, there was probable cause to arrest <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"852\">*852</page-number>him. Accordingly, Carter has shown no error with respect to the district court\u2019s dismissal of his Fourth Amendment claim or his state law claim of malicious prosecution, which requires a showing of no probable cause. <em>See Mangieri v. Clifton, </em>29 F.3d 1012, 1016 (5th Cir.1994); <em>Vance v. Nunnery, </em>137 F.3d 270, 274 (5th Cir.1998); <em>Miller v. East Baton Rouge Parish Sheriffs Department, </em>511 So.2d 446 (La.1987). In addition, although Carter\u2019s version of the events on the day in question differ from the officers\u2019 versions, his assertion that their accounts in the police report and at trial were intentionally false is eonclusional and wholly unsupported by evidence in the record, and therefore, fails to create a genuine issue of material fact. <em>See Orthopedic &amp; Sports Injury Clinic v. Wang Labs., Inc., </em>922 F.2d 220, 225 (5th Cir.1991); <em>see also Koch v. Puckett, </em>907 F.2d 524, 531 (5th Cir.1990). The lack of evidence of false statements or perjury was an additional basis for the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment. Accordingly, the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment and dismissal of Carter\u2019s civil rights complaint are AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-4\">In a consolidated appeal, Godfrey, Louis, and the City of Kenner appeal the district court\u2019s denial of their motion for attorneys\u2019 fees. The district court\u2019s denial of this motion is AFFIRMED as we find no abuse of discretion in the district court\u2019s ruling. <em>See Walker v. City of Bogalusa, </em>168 F.3d 237, 239 (5th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b880-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b879-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
