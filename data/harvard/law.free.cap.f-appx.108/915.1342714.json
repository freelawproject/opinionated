Therefore, the district court erred when it increased Rodriguez\u2019s base offense level by 12 levels. Accordingly, the sentence is VACATED, and this case is REMANDED for resentencing in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-9\">Rodriguez\u2019s unopposed motion to vacate and remand or, alternatively, for an extension of time to file a reply brief is DENIED as moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-10\">SENTENCE VACATED AND REMANDED FOR RESENTENCING; MOTION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b944-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
