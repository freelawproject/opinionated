She argues that the BIA erred when it determined that her continuous physical presence in the United States was interrupted in July 2000 for purposes of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(b)(l)(A). As the respondent argues, the BIA implicitly decided Huerta\u2019s appeal under 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(e)(5), which authorizes a single board member to issue a brief order affirming, modifying, or remanding the immigration judge\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b969-25\">This court has jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s order. <em>See Mireles-Valdez v. Ashcroft, </em>349 F.3d 213, 217 (5th Cir.2003). To be eligible for a discretionary cancellation of removal, an alien must satisfy four requirements, one of which is 10 years of continuous physical presence in the United States. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(b)(l)(A); <em>Mireles-Valdez, </em>349 F.3d at 214-15. Huerta\u2019s voluntary departure from the United States at the border interrupted the continuous-presence requirement for cancellation of removal. <em>See Mireles-Valdez, </em>349 F.3d at 217-19.</p>\n<p id=\"b969-26\">The Respondent\u2019s motion for summary affirmance or in the alternative for an extension of time to file a brief is DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b969-27\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b969-21\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
