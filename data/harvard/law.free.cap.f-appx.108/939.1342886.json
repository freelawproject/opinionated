He first argues that the district court incorrectly applied the sentencing guidelines by assessing him a nine-level adjustment based on a factual finding that he transported more than 100 aliens.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-4\">Garcia entered into a plea agreement wherein he waived his right to appeal a sentence imposed within the guidelines range. Although neither party addresses the waiver, we will do so because a waiver of the right to appeal would deprive this court of jurisdiction. <em>See United States v. Martinez, </em>263 F.3d 436, 438 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b968-5\">A defendant may waive his right to appeal as part of a valid plea agreement if the waiver is knowing and voluntary. <em>United States v. Robinson, </em>187 F.3d 516, 517 (5th Cir.1999). The defendant must know that he \u201chad a right to appeal his sentence and that he was giving up that right.\u201d <em>United States v. Portillo, </em>18 F.3d 290, 292 (5th Cir.1994)(internal quotations and citation omitted); <em>see also </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 11(c)(6) (the district court has a duty to advise the defendant of the terms of the waiver-of-appeal provision)(version applicable to guilty pleas entered prior to Dec. 1, 2002). An appeal in contravention of the waiver provision should be dismissed. <em>United States v. Melancon, </em>972 F.2d 566, 568 (5th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b968-6\">Garcia\u2019s argument that the district court erred in its fact-finding regarding the number of aliens smuggled \u201cis plainly waived by the agreement.\u201d <em>See Martinez, </em>263 F.3d at 438. Moreover, the record demonstrates that the district court complied with Fed.R.Crim.P. 11(c)(6) by advising Garcia of the terms of the waiver-of-appeal provision. Garcia indicated that he knew the rights he was giving up under the terms of the plea agreement. Because the waiver was knowing and voluntary, it will be enforced. <em>See Melancon, </em>972 F.2d at 568.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-8\">Garcia\u2019s second argument is that the 120-month sentence he received on the firearms count amounted to an unjustified upward departure. Because Garcia preserved his right to appeal a sentence not within the guidelines range, this court must determine whether the sentence was within the guidelines range or whether it amounted to an upward departure from that range.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-9\">When multiple counts are contained in the same indictment, \u201cthe sentence imposed on each count shall be the total punishment as determined in accordance with Part D of Chapter Three, and Part C of [Chapter Five].\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.2(b) &amp; comment, (n.l). The \u201ctotal punishment\u201d is determined by combining the offense levels for the offenses, \u201ctaking the offense level applicable to the Group with the highest offense level and increasing that offense level\u201d in accordance with the table in \u00a7 3D 1.4. U.S.S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 3D1.4, 3D1.5. \u201cIf the sentence imposed on the count carrying the highest statutory maximum is adequate to achieve the total punishment, then the sentences on all counts shall run concurrently____\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.2(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b968-10\">The 120-month term of imprisonment on the firearms count was not the result of an upward departure, but rather the result of the district court\u2019s correct application of the sentencing guidelines. Accordingly, Garcia\u2019s challenge to the sentence is waived under the terms of the plea agreement. Garcia\u2019s argument that <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), provides additional grounds for reversal of his sentence is foreclosed in this court. <em>See United States v. Pineiro, </em>377 F.3d 464, 465-466 (5th Cir.<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"941\">*941</page-number>2004). The appeal is DISMISSED. <em>See Martinez, </em>263 F.3d at 439.</p>\n<p id=\"b969-5\">APPEAL DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b967-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
