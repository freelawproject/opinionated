Singleton filed a pleading responding to the district court\u2019s order, arguing the merits of her complaint, and contending she did not receive the appropriate notice of her right to file objections to the magistrate judge\u2019s report. The district court docketed this pleading as a notice of appeal. We dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction because Singleton\u2019s pleading failed to comply with Fed. R.App. P. 3, and as a consequence failed to invoke the jurisdiction of this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-25\">Parties are accorded thirty days after the entry of the district court\u2019s final judgment or order to note an appeal, Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(1)(A). A proper notice of appeal must specify the parties to the case, the order appealed from, and the court to which the appeal is taken. Fed. R.App. P. 3(c). Singleton\u2019s post-judgment pleading filed in the district court fails to comply <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"748\">*748</page-number>with this rule. It fails to mention a court of appeals and lacks any reference to an intent to appeal. To the contrary, the document evinces a desire for continued litigation before the district court and the magistrate judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-4\">Because Singleton failed to invoke the jurisdiction of this court, we dismiss the appeal.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-5\">\n<em>DISMISSED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b776-16\"> We also note that to the extent that Singleton\u2019s application to proceed in forma pauperis or her informal brief could be construed as a notice of appeal, both were untimely. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(1)(A).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
