Yet the said defendant, not regarding his duty in the premises, did not, nor would, erect any fence whatever upon the sides of said line or route, nor did he, nor would he, guard\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>secure, and prevent from escape said cattle, horses, or sheep of the plaintiff, then and there being, but, on the contrary, the said defendant then and there carelessly, negligently, and improperly threw doWn the fence of plaintiff on said close and premises, and carelessly, negligently, and improperly suffered the same to remain thrown down,\u201d by means whereof certain horses, cattle and sheep of plaintiff escaped from said close and premises, and were wholly lost to said plaintiff. Defendant pleaded the general issue.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b411-5\">On the trial before a jury, it was admitted by the defendant that he was a contractor of the Detroit, Monroe <em>&amp; </em>Toledo Railroad Company, under a contract With said company to make the grade of said road from Detroit to Toledo.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b411-6\">The plaintiff\u2019s testimony, among other things, tended to show that the plaintiff, in the summer of 1856, and while the defendant was at work under his contract, was in the occupation (claiming under a lease) of a lot through which said road runs, west of, and near, the city of Detroit ; that the lot was a meadow, the hay from which had been cut off; but whether it had been used as a pasture during that season, before, did not appear; that the road had been, wholly or in part, graded across said lot previous to the loss of the sheep by plaintiff, as hereinafter stated, but that no fence had been built on either side of said track; that -on a Sunday, in the last of July, or fore part of August, 1856, the plaintiff put seventy-three sheep into said lot; that the fences were then up; that plaintiff\u2019s servants, at that time, carefully examined the fences across the track, and all around the pasture; that on the morning of the next day the fence was taken down across the track bn the side of the lot nearest Detroit, by men in the employ of the defendant, and who were then at work in a lot on that side of, and adjoining, the lot of the plaintiff, and that the sheep escaped through the .gap thus made, and most of them were lost. There <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>was no evidence on the part of the plaintiff to show that, the defendant, or his men, knew that any sheep were in-said lot, or that they had escaped from it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b412-5\">It was admitted by the plaintiff, on said trial, that the-Detroit, Monroe <em>&amp; </em>Toledo Railroad Company was a cor-, poration, duly organized and established, under the Genera], Railroad Law of 1855: That the defendant was rightfully in possession, for the purposes of making said grade, and that the railroad company had taken the necessary steps to have the damages for taking the land required to build a road across said lot, &amp;c., appraised by commissioners* whose report had been duly confirmed and recorded, and the amount awarded had been paid. There was no proof that it was any part of the defendant\u2019s contract to fence the sides of the track.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b412-6\">The defendant then introduced, as witnesses, W. W* Johnson, defendant\u2019s foreman on the grading job of this section of the road, Stephen Livernois, foreman of the defendant\u2019s clearing gang, on the same section, and Jerry Mahany and John Tagin, laborers in the grading gang which made the grade across the plaintiff\u2019s pasture, and the lots adjoining, whose testimony went to show that they had no knowledge that plaintiff had any sheep in his pasture, and that they did not know or hear, at the time, that any sheep escaped from plaintiff\u2019s lot.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b412-7\">The defendant, among other things, requested the court to charge the jury,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b412-8\">1. That the defendant, as contractor of the railroad company, had a right to take down the fences across the. track of said company, and was under no obligation ta replace them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b412-9\">2. That the defendant was under no obligation to build fences on the sides of said track; that being a duty im-. posed by statute upon the corporation; and that the neglect of the corporation to build such fences did not take away the right of the defendant to remove the fences across <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>\u25a0the proposed road, nor place him. under any obligation to replace them; and that he was therefore not liable for any damage occasioned by his neglect in leaving down a fence across the track, which he had removed while grading the road.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b413-5\">3. That the only persons, under the statute, liable to \u25a0pay for damages occasioned by the neglect of the corporation to build fences on each side, were the corporation, 'or their agents; that defendant was not such agent, and therefore not liable in this action.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b413-6\">4. That the agents of the corporation were only liable for damages done to the cattle, horses, and other animals <em>\u2018on </em>the track, and therefore not liable for the escape of such animals from adjoining lots over such track, and their consequent loss; and that the defendant, even if he was such agent, would not, therefore, be liable in this action.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b413-7\">5. That the defendant and his agents were only bound to ordinary care in preventing the escape of cattle and \u2018other animals from lands through which he was building the road, and that it would not be neglect for which defendant would be liable, to leave down, while at work, a fence across the road in a meadow where no cattle or other animals were known to be pasturing.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b413-8\">6. That if \u2019the plaintiff turned his sheep into the pasture while men were at work there grading the road across it, and while they were constantly taking down and leaving down the fence, he acted at his own risk, and could not recover for the escape of said sheep, unless he proved that defendant, or his agents, knew that said sheep were there.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b413-9\">The court refused to charge as requested, and, among \u2022other things, charged the jury: That the Detroit, Monroe Toledo Railroad Company had a right to enter upon -the defendant\u2019s lot, for the purpose of grading them road \u2022across it, and had a right to take down the fences across \u2022said road, and to leave them down; but, until side fences <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>were built, were bound to prevent the escape of any sheep or other animals from said lot, either by keeping-up the fences, or employing other means to guard against their escape: that said company, instead of doing said work themselves, had a right to employ the defendant to do it for them; that he was not the agent of the company, but, within the limits of his contract, had the rights, and was subject to the responsibilities, of said corporation; that he was under no obligation to build fences on the sides of the railroad track, and had a right to take down fences across the track, but was, while in the possession of the road for the purpose of grading it, under the like obligation to guard against the escape of sheep and other animals from the defendant\u2019s lot, as thp corporation would be under in the same circumstances; and that, if the pla\u00f1ir tiff\u2019s sheep escaped in consequence of the fence across the track being taken down, or left down, by the defendant\u2019s men, while in his employ, the plaintiff was entitled to recover the damages which resulted therefrom; and this whether the defendant, or his agents, knew that said sheep were in the lot or not; as the fence was taken down at the defendant\u2019s risk, and it was his duty to <em>hnow </em>whether any sheep were there or not, and to guard against theiy escape.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b414-5\">The court further charged the jury that they- must be satisfied that the plaintiff\u2019s sheep escaped by means of the fence being taken down by defendant, or men in his employment, and in the course of the duty they were employed to perform, or the plaintiff could not recover.;, but that unless the sides of the track were fenced, the defendant was not at liberty to throw open the fence of plaintiff\u2019s pasture, where it crossed the track, and leave it open and unguarded, to the injury of the plaintiff in the ordinary and' lawful use of his pasture; and that if the jury were satisfied that the defendant had been guilty of such neglect in this, case, and that thereby the plain,-. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>tiff had lost his sheep, he was liable therefor to the plaintiff in this action. To which refusal to charge as requested, and to the charge as given, the defendant excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b415-5\">The jury, under the charge of the court, returned a verdict for the plaintiff, and defendant brought error.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b415-6\"><em>Jerome &lt;&amp; </em>Swift, for plaintiff in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b415-7\">The railroad company having complied with the requirements [of the statute under which it was organized, and made compensation to the persons whose property was taken for the use of the road, had a right to do whatever was necessary for the construction of such road, and was not liable for any damages occasioned by the doing of anything authorized by the' statute. \u2014 <em>Redf. on Railw. </em>156, 167; 2 <em>Johns. </em>283; 4 <em>T.

J.:</author>\n<p id=\"b417-9\">The General Railroad Act, <em>(Oomp. L. </em>\u00a71987) requires every corporation formed under 'it to \u201cerect and maintain fences on the sides of their road, of the height and strength of a division fence required by law,\u201d and provides that \u201cuntil such fences shall be duly made, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>corporation and their agents shall be liable for all damages which shall be done by their agents or engines to , cattle, horses or other animals thereon, <em>and all other damages which may result from the neglect of said corporation to erect and maintain fences as </em>aforesaid, and after such fences shall be erected and maintained, the corporation shall not be liable for any such damage, unless negligently or wilfully done.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">At the common law one owning land adjoining a public highway was under no obligation to erect and maintain exterior fences, nor was the public, or a company occupying such highway (as for example, a turnpike company), bound to construct fences along its sides. Hence if the cattle of the adjoining land owner strayed upon a highway, and were injured by one traveling upon it, the owner was without remedy, unless the injury was occasioned by wantonness or negligence. As respects private lands, the owner was liable for all damages committed by his cattle in trespassing upon those of another, nor could he recover damages for injuries to them while thus trespassing, unless wantonly and mischievously committed. The track of a railroad is the property of the corporation, and accordingly in <em>Williams v. The Mich. Central R. R. Co. </em>(2 <em>Mich. </em>259) the same doctrines were held applicable to such roads; and the company, in that case, were held not to be liable for the destruction, by their engine, of cattle trespassing upon their road, as the company were uj)on their own lands, in pursuit of their lawful calling, and exercising due care in that pursuit. The owner was held to be in fault for allowing his cattle to stray from his lands, and was hence remediless.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-6\">Subsequent to this decision, the General Railroad Act, above referred to, was passed, and this introduced a new rule, and effected a radical change in the law so far as the rights, duties and liabilities of such companies are concerned. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>These roads, although declared public, are in no sense highways. They are in reality, and from necessity must be, private in their use; and the nature and character of such use requires that they should be securely enclosed, for the \u25a0protection of persons and property transported along them, and also for the protection of the property of residents in their vicinity. The duty of enclosing them is very properly imposed upon the railroad company, and the privileges and franchises they enjoy are a consideration for it. As the road is the private property of the company, and the public has no rights upon and along it at all analogous to those enjoyed upon a common road or highway, and as its exclusive use must be in the company, it is but just and reasonable that the whole burthen of enclosing and securing the road should be cast upon them, and that they should be subject to liability for all losses or injuries, however occurring, resulting from a neglect to fence it. Hence the act imposes upon such company the general duty of erecting and maintaining fences along the sides of their road, and makes them absolutely and unconditionally liable for all injuries, however occasioned, which may result, from their neglect of this duty; while for injuries occurring while sufficient fences exist, they are only made liable in case of Wilfulness or negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">In the case before us, the propriety of the law is not questioned by the plaintiff in error, and its necessity upon grounds of public security is admitted; but it is claimed that this duty \u00a1is not imposed until the road is operated. This view is based upon the idea that the public security Was the paramount consideration influencing the Legislature in making the law. But the statute having imposed this as a rgeneral duty, it was obligatory upon the company, as soon as they took possession of the road, and entered along Its line for the purpose of constructing it. It is construing the statute too narrowly, to hold that the duty and liability of the company only commenced with the operating of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>road, or that private rights and interests were not within the consideration of the Legislature in enacting it. The road became the property of the company from the time of the condemnation of the land, and the payment of the damages assessed therefor; or from that of the acquisition' of title by them by purchase; and they had thereafter a right to enter upon it for its construction. But if in so entering, they threw down the fences of an enclosure, it became their duty to erect side fences for the security and protection of the adjoining proprietor through whose land the road ran, or to take other precautionary steps to secure him from loss or injury. They have no right to insist that during the time occupied in the construction of the road, and until it is operated, the adjacent owner, whose fences have been prostrated, is bound to erect and maintain temporary fences along its line, or to set a guard, or employ any other means to prevent loss or injury to his property, or else to be deprived of the use of his lands thrown open by them. He is entitled to their use for the purpose of cultivation, or depasturing, at all times, up to the line of the road. This right was not embraced in the condemnation of his lands, and the assessment of damages, if the land was condemned; nor necessarily in its sale, if procured without condemnation ; and when they entered his enclosure the company were bound to respect it.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">They could not presume, nor had they a right to require, that he would abandon the use of his lands thus thrown open; or to insist that he should use them at his own risk.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-6\">The neglect of the company, in the case before us, to erect fences renders them liable, therefore, for all damages resulting therefrom; and the fact that they were constantly 'throwing down and leaving down his fences did not put the defendant in error in the wrong in turning- his sheep into the enclosure. The first wrong being theirs, the statute makes them liable for all the consequences which ensue.\u2014 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>See. <em>Smith v. The Eastern Railroad, </em>35 <em>N. H. </em>356; <em>Hurd v. R. &amp; B. R. R. </em>25 <em>Vt. </em>116.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-5\">But while such is the duty and liability of the company, it is insisted that the plaintiff in error, being a contractor with \u2022the company for grading the track, was not bound to construct fences along its line, and consequently can not be made liable for the loss of the defendant\u2019s sheep. But the statute renders liable \u201c the corporation and their <em>agents\u2019'\u2019 </em>for all damages resulting from the neglect to erect and maintain fences. Under its provisions, an agent who, while in the employment of the company, commits or occasions any damage to the person or property of another, is liable for the injury, although it may be clearly shown to have occurred by'reason of the neglect of the company to fence their road, and not through his own wantonness or negligence ; and although an action would also lie against the company. And we think Gardner was an agent within the letter and spirit of the act. It was evidently intended to embrace, under the denomination of agent, every one in the employment of the company. The word is to be taken in an enlarged sense, to include those who exercise the power of the company upon or over the road, as well as those acting as engineers, or in any other subordinate capacity,* and who may be active in, or connected with the commission of the injury. Thus in <em>Clement v. Canfield </em>(28 <em>Vt. </em>303) a lessee of a railroad, in possession, was held to be an agent within the meaning of a like statute, and in <em>The </em>Chicago, <em>St. Paul and Fond du Lac R. R. v. McCarthy, </em>(20 <em>Ill. R. </em>385) a <em>contractor </em>was held to be an agent under the statute of Illinois.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-6\">But not only was Gardner liable as an agent under the statute, but he was also primarily liable as a contractor posessing and exercising the power of the company over the' road for the purpose of its construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-7\">By assuming the control of this section of the road, he assumed the responsibilities which the law imposed upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>the company respecting its nse, and the liabilities which the law imposed for its improper use. In letting down Smith\u2019s fence, he rendered himself liable for the consequences, to the same extent that the company would have been, had the act been done by their servants and laborers; for he, as contractor, has no greater rights, nor other exemptions from liability for his wrongful acts, than the company would have. Without taking the proper precautions, either by erecting temporary fences, or otherwise, he was, as to Smith, a <em>tort </em>feasor, not to the extent of liability for damages in entering upon the line of the road, it is true, but to that of liability for damages directly attributable to the neglect of those precautions.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-5\">As a contractor, in undertaking to do the work, he undertook to do it in a laAvful manner, and it was his duty thus to execute it. While he was not bound to erect and maintain a permanent fence along the sides of the road he was constructing, he was responsible for all damages sustained by Smith, from loss or injury to his sheep, or other property, to the same extent that the company are made liable by the statute. His power could not exceed theirs, and his liability was co-extensive with theirs.

As between the corporation and Smith there is no inconvenience or expense which the former ought not more justly and equitably to bear than the latter. No appraisal of the probable loss of, or injury to, the cattle or other personal property of Smith, or of the expense of the construction of temporary fences, or the provision of other safe guards for their protection, was, or could be, made by a jury upon the condemnation of his lands; and in ease of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>a voluntary \u00bf alienation by him, the requirements of the statute will not|be presumed to have been waived.
