Since zoning began in the District of Columbia in 1920, this area has been zoned for commercial and industrial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>uses.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> But the area seems about to undergo substantial changes and it is that possibility that brought this case before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">The National Capital Planning Commission (NCPC), the professional planning agency for the District of Columbia, is charged with preparing a comprehensive land-use plan for the <em>District.</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>In 1969, the NCPC adopted a plan which, in part, called for the waterfront area to be devoted to low-density residential and parkland uses.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In 1971, the President called for immediate action to insure the preservation of the waterfront<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and, in response, on January 26, 1972, the NCPC and the District of Columbia contracted with a group of private planners for a $270,000 study of the Waterfront to prepare a development program implementing the NCPC\u2019s recommendations for the area.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-6\">In the interim, however, the intervenors in this suit<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> announced plans to build major new commercial centers in the area which would be permitted by the present zoning.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Seeking to ward off the threat to implementation of the comprehensive plan posed by new commercial development on the waterfront, the appellants herein petitioned the Zoning Commission to adopt an interim amendment to the Zoning ordinance, preventing major construction not in conformance with the NCPC\u2019s 1969 Comprehensive Plan recommendations until the completion of the pending study. When the Zoning Commission failed to respond, the appellants brought suit for mandamus to compel action by the Commission in the District of Columbia Court of Appeals.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> That court found that it did not have the power to provide the requested- relief since the Zoning Commission\u2019s action was not reviewable as a \u201ccontested case\u201d under the District of Columbia Administrative Procedure Act.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Finally, on June 29, 1972, the Zoning Commission did adopt an emergency amendment<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> to the Zoning Regulations to preserve the <em>status quo </em>in the waterfront area until hearings could be held on the appellants\u2019 proposal for a two-year interim amendment downzoning the area -to prevent its commercial development until the ongoing study was completed.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>Hearings were held in August of 1972 and testimony was given favoring adoption of the interim amendment by the NCPC, its planning consultants and several citizen groups. The Zoning Advisory Council<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> also supported the proposal. Opponents of the proposed down-zoning included the intervenors, Georgetown-Inland and Maloney Concrete, as well as the Washington Metropolitan Board of Trade and a number of corporate and individual owners of property in the affected area. On October 4, the Zoning Commission revoked its emergency order and declined to adopt the proposed interim amendment.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b474-4\">Appellants then filed suit in federal District Court challenging the Commission\u2019s order on the grounds that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-5\">1) the Commission acted unlawfully in rejecting the recommendation of the NCPC; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-6\">2) the Commission\u2019s action was arbitrary and unreasonable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b474-7\">The District Court denied appellants\u2019 motions for a temporary restraining order on October 12, and for a preliminary injunction on October 25. On November 9, this court entered an order restraining construction of the planned new commercial centers in the Waterfront area pending the District Court\u2019s final decision.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> On November 20, the District Court granted appellees\u2019 motion for summary judgment<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> and on November 24, this court issued an order, in effect, reinstating its restraining order of November 9. The District Court\u2019s grant of summary judgment was on the grounds that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-9\">1) \u201cThe NCPC Comprehensive Plan is advisory only and not binding on the Zoning Commission,\u201d and that</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-11\">2) there was no showing that the Zoning Commission\u2019s action was \u201carbitrary or unreasonable.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b474-12\">The instant appeal is from that decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-13\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b474-14\">The Zoning Commission of the District of Columbia is entrusted with the authority to adopt and amend zoning regulations which, among other qualifications, must \u201cbe made in accordance with a comprehensive plan.\u201d 5 D.C.Code \u00a7 413 (1967). The National Capital Planning Commission (NCPC) is required to \u201cprepare, adopt and amend a comprehensive plan for the National Capital and made related recommendations to the appropriate developmental agencies [and to] serve as the central planning agency for the Federal and District Governments ... in order to advise as to consistency with the comprehensive plan. . . .\u201d 1 D.C.Code \u00a7 1001 et seq. (1967). The NCPC is further empowered to \u201cmake a report and recommendation to the Zoning Commission of the District of Columbia on proposed amendments of the zoning regulations and maps as to the relation or conformity of such amendments with the comprehensive plan of the District of Columbia.\u201d 1 D.C.Code \u00a7 1008(a) (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b474-16\">Appellants suggest the requirement that the Commission\u2019s zoning regulations be \u201cin accordance with a comprehensive plan\u201d is a reference to the comprehensive plan that the NCPC is charged with preparing. But the courts of this jurisdiction have repeatedly held that term \u201ccomprehensive plan\u201d in 5 D.C.Code \u00a7 413 is not synonymous with the comprehensive plan referred to in the National Capital Planning Act of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>1952, 1 D.C.Code \u00a7 1001 et seq.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The requirement that the Zoning Commission adopt zoning regulations in accordance with a comprehensive plan rather refers to the Commission\u2019s obligation to zone on a uniform and comprehensive basis.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> We cannot therefore accept appellants\u2019 contentions that the Zoning Commission was bound to follow the recommendation of the NCPC or that it may override that recommendation only by showing a compelling public interest in doing so.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b475-4\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b475-5\">In reviewing the action of the Zoning Commission, we consider only whether \u201cin denying the application [the Commission] was arbitrary and capricious, [i. e. its decision had] no substantial relationship to the general welfare.\" <footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Although the Commission\u2019s actions are entitled to a presumption of validity, it must \u201cput forward, or the court [be] otherwise able to discern, some basis in fact and law to justify the action as consistent with reasonableness.\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> The Commission\u2019s challenged decision offered no reasons.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> The court in a case as complex as the one before us is hesitant to extrapolate the required basis from the record before the Commission without the benefit of the Commission\u2019s expertise and guidance. We therefore order the Zoning Commission to file a statement of the reasons for its decision within 45 days. We neither express nor intimate any position on the merits by this holding.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>Two strands of doctrine apply to our review of administrative agency decisions. The first is the presumption of validity of .an agency\u2019s actions. An agency such as the Zoning Commission is expected to apply its expertise in making decisions like the one before us and courts should not attempt to substitute their judgment for that of the agency to whose discretion those decisions have been committed by Congress.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Second, respect for an agency\u2019s expertise does not eliminate the need for judicial review of agency actions, and inherent in that albeit limited power of review is the need for an agency to spell out its reasoning.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> As Justice Harlan said in the Permian Basin Area Rate Cases, 390 U.S. 747, 792, 88 S.Ct. 1344, 1373, 20 L.Ed.2d 312 (1968):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A3H\">The court\u2019s responsibility is not to supplant the Commission\u2019s balance of [competing] interests with one more nearly to its liking, but instead to assure itself that the Commission has given reasoned consideration to each of the pertinent factors. Judicial review of the Commission\u2019s orders will therefore function accurately and efficaciously only if the Commission indicates fully and carefully the . . . purposes for which, it has chosen to act.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b476-16\">The case for requiring a statement of reasons from an administrative agency is a persuasive one. Those reasons may be crucial in order for the court to know what the agency has really determined, hence what to review. Courts ought not to have to speculate as to the basis for an administrative agency\u2019s conclusions ;<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> nor can a court \u201cassume without explanation that proper standards are implicit in every act of agency discretion.\u201d<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> And, when faced with a complex problem, having widespread ramifications, like that before us today, a court should surely have the benefit of the agency\u2019s expertise.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Finally, the articulation of reasons by an agency \u2014 for itself and for the public \u2014 does afford a safeguard against arbitrary and careless action and is apt to result in greater consistency in an agency\u2019s decisionmaking.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b476-17\">It is true that the Zoning Commission is a quasi-legislative body and is not required to support its legislative-type judgments with findings of fact.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> But, as the District of Columbia Court of Appeals has noted, there are important elements of a non-legislative nature to the Commission\u2019s decisions.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> And there are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>important distinctions between our review of the Zoning Commission and our review of the acts of a legislature.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> Thus, while the legislative character of the Commission\u2019s decision may take it outside the strict application of <em>Chenery,</em><footnotemark><em>29</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the Commission may still be required to state reasons for its decisions.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> Reasons differ from findings in that reasons relate to law, policy, and discretion rather than to facts<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> and even where findings are not required, a disclosure of an agency\u2019s reasons is often desirable.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b477-4\">Not only are the arguments for a general requirement of reasons clearly applicable to the actions of the Zoning Commission but the facts of this case make all the more compelling the need for an articulation of reasons by that agency. The District of Columbia Administrative Procedure Act (DC-APA)<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> expressly imposes such a requirement in \u201ccontested cases\u201d. That, of course, does not bar imposing a requirement of stated reasons in the present context. On the contrary, the legislative history of the DC-APA indicates Congress assumed that we would construct such a requirement or believed that the courts already had. That act was meant only to prescribe <em>minimum </em>procedures.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> Before the DC-APA was passed, the District Court in Donovan v. Clark<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> held that even though the Zoning Commission\u2019s decisions are legislative in character, the court\u2019s limited power of review could only be properly exercised when that agency set forth the reasons for its decision. In the Committee reports on the DC-APA, the following observation was made in regard to that holding:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-13\">The <em>Donovan </em>decision reaffirmed and applied an elemental principal of fair administrative procedure so far as appeals from the decisions of the Zoning Commission . . . are concerned.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b477-15\">Second, if the recommendation of the NCPC, the District\u2019s professional planning agency, had been adopted here, we would, of course, have that agency\u2019s re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>port to provide us both with some explanation of the Commission\u2019s action and the benefit of the expertise that we now seek from the Commission. But, in this case, the Commission rejected the NCPC\u2019s recommendations, clearly distinguishing it from Gerstenfeld v. Jett.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b478-4\">Finally, we must realize that lurking in the shadows of this case is an issue not raised by the parties but, in a different form, before this court in another case.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> That case involves the question of whether a recommendation of the NCPC, a federal agency, to the local Zoning Commission must be accompanied by an environmental impact statement. That issue is not before the court today, but it is appropriate to take note of the strong and pervasive congressional interest in environmental protection. As the National Capital Planning Commission has noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-5\">In view of the unique federal presence at the seat of government, a special effort should be made by the Federal and District of Columbia Governments in the National Capital Region to implement the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969. Such a special and continuing effort in this region could well serve as a demonstration for the entire Nation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-7\">* * * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-8\">Although the declaration of a national environmental policy in Section 101 of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 would appear to include actions by the District of Columbia Government, the provisions of sections 102 and 103 which are directed to all agencies of the Federal Government [and require the preparation of environmental impact statements], do not apparently apply to actions of the District of Columbia Government unless federal financial assistance is involved in individual District projects. <em>The various activities of the various District agencies and departments do, in fact, affect the quality of the environment in both the District of Columbia and the National Capital Region as a whole and should, therefore, also meet the objectives and policies of the </em>. . . <em>Act.</em><footnotemark><em>39</em></footnotemark><em> </em>(emphasis added)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b478-14\">Where, as here, the potential environmental effects of the Commission\u2019s decision are substantial, it must at least consider the environmental issue to fulfill its public interest mandate. The judgment as to environmental impact is a determination of policy committed to the discretion of the Commission alone; and where the Commission has struck a balance between environmental and other factors, we will not reverse its decision simply because we would have attached different weights to the competing interests at stake.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> Without a statement of reasons, however, we cannot know whether or not that assessment has, in fact, been made.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-15\">The Zoning Commission, without undue delay and within 45 days of this judgment, shall provide to the public and to the court a statement of the reasons for its challenged decision. The injunctive relief ordered by this court on November 24, 1972, will remain in effect pending a decision on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-16\">It is so ordered.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b473-7\">.

Unlike a legislature, the Zoning Commission is not directly responsible to the voters. In the District of Columbia the electoral responsibility of the Zoning Commission is particularly attenuated, since the Zoning Commission is made up entirely of Presidential appointees, responsible to the executive branch of the federal government and not to the people of the District of Columbia, whose lives are so vitally affected by their decisions. Accordingly, we cannot realistically expect the political process to act as a check on the Commission\u2019s actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-6\">Also, in contrast to Congressional acts, there is no legislative history from which we could discern the purpose for the Commission\u2019s actions. In certain circumstances an NCPC report might serve a function roughly analogous to that of a legislative committee report, but, since the Commission rejected the NCPC\u2019s recommendation in this instance, we do not even have the benefit of that guidance.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"29\">\n<p id=\"b477-7\">.
