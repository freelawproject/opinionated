B. Foster Company to bargain with Shopman\u2019s Local Union No. 694, which was certified as the bargaining representative of certain employees. In the election there were 10 votes cast for the Union and 8 votes against the Union. At issue on appeal is the validity of the Board\u2019s determination that five employees were ineligible to vote because they were supervisors within the meaning of section 2(11), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 152(11) (1971). The facts of this case are similar to National Labor Relations Board v. Houston Natural Gas Corporation, 5 Cir., 1973, 478 F.2d 467, where the Board expressed an opposite view and we agreed that the employees were not supervisors. Finding the present case indistinguishable from <em>Houston Gas, </em>we conclude that the employees were not supervisors and therefore their votes should have been counted.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-5\">Enforcement denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
