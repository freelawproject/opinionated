By this means the United States Government made itself whole for the loss to it resulting from plaintiff bank\u2019s having cashed six stolen Series E United States Savings Bonds for a Mr. Monroe, a professional forger who presented himself as a Mr. Kreiss, the owner of the bonds, having in his possession a forged driver\u2019s license, Social Security card, and credit cards in the name of said Kreiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-14\">The facts before the District Judge indicated that Mr. Monroe was a complete stranger to the bank personnel, that the bonds had a New Jersey mailing address, and that he presented a driver\u2019s license with a Pennsylvania address. The bank officers did not seek to corroborate Mr. Monroe\u2019s statements as to his intention to purchase a coin collection in Elizabethton, Tennessee, nor did the bank officers seek corroboration of his identification documents.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-15\">The District Judge found that the bank personnel \u201csimply did not' exert due care in cashing these forged bonds.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b679-16\">31 U.S.C. \u00a7 757c(i) (1970) authorizes the Treasurer of the United States to issue regulations pertaining to the fault or negligence of paying agents such as the plaintiff bank in the cashing of Savings Bonds. In a Treasury Department statement dated December 19, 1947, concerning identification of persons seeking to cash such bonds, and pertaining directly to the employment of motor vehicle operator\u2019s licenses for such purposes, the instruction statement said in part, \u201cIn any case of doubt, other acceptable documents should be required for corroborative purposes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b679-17\">Under the total circumstances of this case, as set out above, and as set out more fully in the District Judge\u2019s opinion filed June 15, 1972, we conclude that the District Judge\u2019s finding of lack of due care is not clearly erroneous. Fed.R.Civ.P. 52(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b679-18\">The judgment of the District Court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
