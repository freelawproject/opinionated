Solomon, United States District Judge, Portland, Oregon, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b991-7\">SOLOMON, District Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b991-8\">Torres appeals his conviction for importing and possessing cocaine and heroin. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1), 952 and 960.</p>\n<p id=\"b991-9\">On January 18, 1972, Torres drove from San Diego to Tijuana with Isabel Figueroa and Anselmo Lebr\u00f3n. They stayed in Tijuana about seven hours and then returned to the United States. The customs inspector at the San Ysidro Port of Entry found 1.75 ounces of heroin and .6 gram of cocaine in Torres\u2019 jacket pocket.</p>\n<p id=\"b991-10\">At trial, Torres asserted that he did not know how the drugs got there. He testified that there were no drugs in the jacket when he put it in the back seat of the car; that he put on the jacket when he got out of the car at the customs station; and that he did not notice the small package of drugs until the inspector found it.</p>\n<p id=\"b991-13\">Lebr\u00f3n rode in the back seat of the car. According to Torres, Lebr\u00f3n put the drugs in the jacket while it was on the back seat. Torres called Figueroa as a defense witness, but she could not remember whether the jacket had been in the back. Torres also called Lebr\u00f3n. Lebr\u00f3n testified that Torres wore the jacket the entire time.</p>\n<p id=\"b991-14\">Torres wanted to impeach Lebron\u2019s testimony by introducing his prior conviction for selling heroin, for which Lebr\u00f3n was on probation. The trial judge refused to permit Torres to do this on the ground that, absent surprise, one may not impeach his own witness. The Court also rejected Torres\u2019 request that the Court call Lebr\u00f3n as the Court\u2019s own witness. Torres asserts that the Court\u2019s refusal to permit impeachment was error requiring reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b991-15\">We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b991-16\">It was crucial to Torres\u2019 defense to show that Lebron\u2019s testimony was false and that Lebr\u00f3n had reason to lie. It was in Lebron\u2019s interest to lie to save himself from prosecution and from revocation of his probation for the prior conviction. If the Court had permitted Torres to introduce Lebron\u2019s record, the jury might have disbelieved Lebron\u2019s testimony and acquitted Torres.</p>\n<p id=\"b991-17\">In United States v. Freeman, 302 F.2d 347, 351 (2d Cir. 1962), the Second Circuit rejected the rule against impeaching a party\u2019s own witness as a pointless limitation on the \u201csearch for truth.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b991-18\">The Proposed Federal Rules of Evidence (Rule 607) also reject the old rule. The Advisory Committee recommended this change because:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b991-19\">\u201cA party does not hold out his witnesses as worthy of belief since he rarely has a free choice in selecting them. Denial of the right [of impeachment] leaves the party at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"924\">*924</page-number>mercy of the witness and the adversary.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b992-4\">In the recent case of Chambers v. Mississippi, 410 U.S. 284, 93 S.Ct. 1038, 35 L.Ed.2d 297 (1973), the Supreme Court reversed a state court conviction in which a defendant was not permitted to impeach his own witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b992-5\">Reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
