The sole question before the court is whether there is substantial evidence in the record as a whole to support the finding of the Board that the employee was discharged because of his union activities. Having fully examined the record, we are of the opinion that the Board\u2019s order is supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-20\">The petition of the company for review will therefore be denied and the Board\u2019s order against the company finding it guilty of violating the Act will be enforced.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
