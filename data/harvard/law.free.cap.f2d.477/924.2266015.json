S.C. \u00a7 5010(c) (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b992-24\">Appellant was identified at trial by one of the bank robbers as the driver of the get-away car. When he was arrested by the FBI, he had in his possession approximately a third of the proceeds of the bank robbery, including $330 in marked or \u201cbait\u201d money.</p>\n<p id=\"b992-25\">The principal appellate issue argued to the court is appellant\u2019s contention that Judge Thomas committed reversible error when the jury, after two hours of deliberation, returned to court and informed him that they were deadlocked, five jurors being for guilty and seven for acquittal. Judge Thomas then sent them home for the weekend (to return the following Monday morning), telling them in part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b992-26\">Mr. Noster and ladies and gentlemen of the jury, I received your note. However, because of the fact that the jury began its deliberations just this afternoon, I am going to request that you return Monday to resume your deliberations.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b993-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"925\">*925</page-number>I do want to say, though, that a jury, necessarily, to return a verdict, must have the unanimous concurrence of all twelve jurors. It is the duty of the jurors to consult with one another and to deliberate with a view towards reaching agreement, if they can do so without violence to their individual judgment. Each juror, of course, must decide the case for himself, but only after an impartial consideration of the evidence and of the discussion and of the consultation with his fellow jurors.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b993-4\">Remember at all times, finally, that jurors are not partisans. You are judges, judges of the facts. A jury\u2019s sole interest is to seek the truth from the evidence in the case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b993-5\">I would ask that you go home, remember carefully the instructions that you must not talk about this case over this long week end\u2014 ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b993-6\">No objection was made to the Judge\u2019s statement to the jury at the time, as there had been no objection to his charge, which had dealt completely with the presumption of innocence and the requirement of proof beyond reasonable doubt. The jury on Monday morning was in possession of the Judge\u2019s written charge setting forth these elements (among others) of the applicable law.</p>\n<p id=\"b993-7\">It is appellant\u2019s contention that the sentence, \u201cA jury\u2019s sole interest is to seek the truth from the evidence in the case\u201d was in effect substituted by the Judge\u2019s statement for the requirement of proof beyond reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b993-8\">Taking the Judge\u2019s charge and this statement in proper context, we find no reason to conclude that the jury would believe that the requirement of proof beyond reasonable doubt had been eliminated. We find no reversible error as to this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b993-9\">On review of appellant\u2019s complaint concerning the state\u2019s failure to make available to defendant\u2019s counsel a statement taken from defendant\u2019s mother, we are convinced that the limited impeachment use made of same under the District Judge\u2019s instruction did not constitute reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b993-12\">The judgment of the District Court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
