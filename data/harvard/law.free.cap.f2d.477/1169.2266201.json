For the reasons stated at length below we affirm the action of the district court as it pertained to the individual appellants involved, but as to the corporate appellant reverse and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1240-5\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"AH5\">Appellant Americans United, incorporated as \u201cProtestants and Other Americans for Separation of Church and State,\u201d is organized under the laws of the District of Columbia and is a nonprofit educational corporation. On July 3, 1950, the Commissioner of Internal Revenue issued a ruling that Americans United qualified as tax exempt under \u00a7 101(6) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939, the predecessor to \u00a7 501(e)(3) of the 1954 Code.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Consequently, for a period of nearly twenty years not only was Americans United free from taxation upon its income, but also contributors to the corporation were entitled to the deductions provided under \u00a7 170 of the 1954 Code (\u00a7 23(q) of the 1939 Code).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On April 25, 1969, a letter ruling from the Service revoked the 1950 ruling, holding that Americans United had violated \u00a7\u00a7 170(c)(2)(D) and 501(c)(3) of the Code by devoting a substantial part of its activities to attempts to influence legislation. More particularly, the letter ruling stated that although part of Americans United\u2019s activities could be classified as \u201ceducational\u201d or \u201ccharitable\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 501(c)(3) of the Code, it was, nonetheless, an \u201cactive advocate of a political doctrine.\u201d The majority of the corporation\u2019s activities were held to be in furtherance of the following goals: \u201cthe mobilization of public opinion; resisting every attempt by law or the administration of law which widens the breach in the wall of separation of church and state; working for the repeal of any existing state law which sanctions the granting of public aid to church schools; and uniting all \u2018patriotic\u2019 citizens in a concerted effort to prevent the passage of any federal law allotting, directly or indirectly, federal education funds to church schools.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1240-11\">While Americans United still retained a tax exempt status as an organization described in \u00a7 501(c)(4) of the Code,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the removal of its \u00a7 501(c)(3) exemption allegedly proved to be most damaging. Americans United states that its resulting removal from the list of \u00a7 170 corporations to whom tax free contributions could be made dried up its well of con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1173\">*1173</page-number>tributory resources to such an extent that it operated at a deficit for the first time in its history during fiscal year 1970. Consequently, on July 30, 1970, this action was commenced in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia. Two individual plaintiffs, Archer and Lowell, apparently suing as taxpayers who intended in the future to contribute to Americans United, joined with Americans United in bringing the class action.</p>\n<p id=\"b1241-5\">The amended complaint in the district court averred violations of various first and fifth amendment liberties and guarantees: (1) \u00a7\u00a7 170 and 501, and the action of the Commissioner in giving force and effect thereto, were unconstitutional and void insofar as they denied \u00a7 501(e)(3) status to the corporate appellant by reason of its exercise of first amendment rights, and likewise denied individual appellants the privilege of deducting the contributions used as a vehicle to exercise their first amendment rights. (2) Since what was a \u201csubstantial part\u201d in the case of Americans United was not a \u201csubstantial part\u201d in the case of other, larger organizations opposed to appellants\u2019 viewpoint, the change of status because of the substantiality of the activities of one organization as opposed to another in expressing opinions and influencing legislation was an unreasonable classification against Americans United, and by reason thereof Americans United and other organizations similarly situated were being discriminated against and denied equal protection of the laws in violation of the fifth amendment of the United States Constitution. (3) Appellants claimed that their tax dollars were being used by reason of \u00a7\u00a7 170 and 501 in a manner that aided and strengthened churches whose size permitted their influencing of legislation to be \u201crelatively less substantial than that of the corporate [appellant],\u201d and that appellee\u2019s actions in enforcement thereof constituted violations of the establishment and free exercise clauses of the first amendment. (4) The exemption clause of \u00a7 501(c)(3) amounted to an invalid delegation of legislative power \u201cin that the statutory standards of \u2018substantiality\u2019 and \u2018propaganda\u2019 [were] lacking in specificity for the carrying out of the purpose of Section 501(c)(3).\u201d (5) Finally, the defendant acted arbitrarily and capriciously in abuse of his discretion in applying, in this situation, the \u201csubstantial influencing\u201d clause of the statutory exemption of \u00a7 501(c) (3).</p>\n<p id=\"b1241-10\">Appellants\u2019 complaint founded jurisdiction for the action upon 28 U.S. C. \u00a7 1331 (1970) (civil action where amount in controversy exceeds $10,000 and which arises under the Constitution and laws of the United States), 28 U.S. C. \u00a7 1340 (1970) (whereby jurisdiction is bestowed in the federal district court in any civil action arising under an Act of Congress providing for internal revenue), and \u00a7 10 of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 701-706 (1970) (making final agency action subject to judicial review). Appellants also sought the convention of a three-judge district court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2282<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and 2284 (1970), and requested the following relief: (1) Declaratory judgment that the \u201cexemption clauses of Section 501(c)(3) [were] separable from the remainder of the section and [were] null and void\u201d as unconstitutional under the first and fifth amendments, and as an invalid delegation of legislative power.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> (2) Judgment \u201cre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1174\">*1174</page-number>quiring\u201d the appellee to \u201creevaluate\u201d corporate appellant as a \u00a7 501(e)(3) charitable corporation and to reinstate corporate appellant on the Cumulative List, Organizations Described in Section 170(c) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, if found to be eligible under the newly constituted \u00a7 501(c)(3). (3) Judgment restraining the appellee from enforcing \u00a7\u00a7 170(c) and 501(c)(3) so as to deprive the individual appellants \u201cof the benefit of tax advantages in the exercise of their First Amendment rights by reason of the unconstitutionality of those sections.\u201d (4) Judgment that appellee acted in an arbitrary and capricious manner in changing the status of corporate appellant. (5) In the alternative, judgment requiring appellee to reopen the revocation proceedings and reevaluate the corporate appellant \u201cin the light of the final decision in this case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1242-5\">Appellee filed a motion to dismiss, based essentially on 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2201 (1970),<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> which prohibits declaratory judgments \u201cwith respect to Federal taxes,\u201d and 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7421(a) (1970),<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> which prohibits suits \u201cfor the purpose of restraining the assessment or collection of any tax.\u201d The trial court denied appellants\u2019 petition to convene a three-judge court, finding that no substantial constitutional question was raised, and granted appellee\u2019s motion to dismiss, citing National Council on the Facts of Overpopulation v. Caplin, 224 F.Supp. 313 (D.D.C.1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b1242-12\">Alleging error in both aspects of the trial court\u2019s order, appellants 'bring this appeal. Contending that no taxes have been assessed or collected, that this is a civil rights rather than tax case, and that they have no other adequate remedy, appellants maintain that the provisions of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7421(a) (1970) and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2201 (1970) cannot be used to prohibit the declaratory and injunctive relief sought. They further contend that they have raised substantial constitutional questions meriting the invoking of a three-judge court under the standards established in Idlewild Bon Voyage Liquor Corp. v. Epstein, 370 U.S. 713, 82 S.Ct. 1294, 8 L.Ed.2d 794 (1962). Appellee\u2019s posture on appeal is somewhat different, of course, and in addition to the grounds listed by the trial judge for dismissing the action he relies upon the doctrine of governmental immunity, claiming this to be an unconsented suit against the United States. Louisiana v. McAdoo, 234 U.S. 627, 34 S.Ct. 938, 58 L.Ed. 1506 (1914).</p>\n<p id=\"b1242-13\">II. JURISDICTION</p>\n<p id=\"Amg\">1. <em>Introduction</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1242-14\">The statutes providing for three-judge \u201cconstitutional\u201d courts, adopted to avoid impolitic action on the part of lone federal district judges in matters of broad regulatory scope, are procedural rather than substantively jurisdictional in nature. A complaint which raises substantial constitutional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1175\">*1175</page-number>questions and otherwise meets the requirements of \u00a7 2282 can and should be dismissed if independent district court jurisdiction is found wanting. \u201c[T]he provision requiring the presence of a court of three judges necessarily assumes that the District Court has jurisdiction.\u201d Ex Parte Poresky, 290 U.S. 30, 31, 54 S.Ct. 3, 4, 78 L.Ed. 152 (1933). This court has held that a dismissal for want of jurisdiction is properly a matter for a single district judge without considering the question of convening a three-judge court. Eastern States Petroleum Corp. v. Rogers, 108 U.S.App.D.C. 63, 280 F.2d 611 (1960), cert. denied, 364 U.S. 891, 81 S.Ct. 222, 5 L.Ed.2d 187 (1960). <em>Accord, </em>National Council on the Facts of Overpopulation v. Caplin, 224 F.Supp. 313 (D.D.C.1963). The first order of business for the single district judge is simply put (although, as here, not so simply decided): Does the district court have jurisdiction even to consider the applicability of a three-judge panel, or are the plaintiffs out of court for lack of subject matter jurisdiction?</p>\n<p id=\"b1243-6\">The anti-injunction statute (26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7421 (1970)) by its terms denies jurisdiction to \u201cany court\u201d in actions seeking to enjoin the assessment or collection of taxes. If such a statute is applicable here the appellants cannot be afforded the relief requested, regardless of the substantiality of the constitutional questions raised. <em>See, e. g., </em>Harvey v. Early, 160 F.2d 836 (4th Cir. 1947).</p>\n<p id=\"b1243-7\"> Although its legislative history may be \u201cshrouded in darkness,\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> the <em>raison d\u2019etre </em>of \u00a7 7421(a) was illuminated by Chief Justice Warren in Enochs v. Williams Packing &amp; Navigation Co., Inc., 370 U.S. 1, 7, 82 S.Ct. 1125, 1129, 8 L.Ed.2d 292 (1962):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1243-9\">The manifest purpose of \u00a7 7421(a) is to permit the United States to assess and collect taxes alleged to be due without judicial intervention, and to require that the legal right to the disputed sums be determined in a suit for refund. <em>In this manner the United States is assured of prompt collection of its lawful revenue. </em>(Emphasis added, footnote omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1243-10\"><em>See also </em>State Railroad Tax Cases, 92 U.S. 575, 613-614, 23 L.Ed. 663 (1875). Section 7421(a) was thus born of administrative and governmental necessity, used to prevent intermeddling in the tax collection process. An offspring of the equity rule that a suit to enjoin the collection of taxes was not maintainable unless an adequate remedy at law was lacking, its language is much stronger and more encompassing in scope. Even if it can be shown that irreparable injury will result if the collection is effected, \u00a7 7421(a) bars a suit for an injunction in the absence of very special circumstances. <em>See Enochs, supra, </em>370 U.S. at 6, 82 S.Ct. 1125.</p>\n<p id=\"b1243-11\">The history of the Declaratory Judgments Act and \u00a7 2201 is somewhat different. When initially promulgated in 1934,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> the phrase \u201cexcept with respect to Federal taxes\u201d was absent from \u00a7 2201. Consequently, federal taxpayers (innovative as they are) quickly utilized it to obtain declaratory judgments holding various tax statutes unconstitutional, something they were barred from accomplishing under the anti-injunction statute.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Congress (innovative as it is) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1176\">*1176</page-number>quickly reacted and amended \u00a7 2201 to include the contentious phrase.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The Senate Finance Committee, in reporting out the amended version, stated that the \u201capplication of the Declaratory Judgments Act to taxes would constitute a radical departure from the long-continued policy of Congress [as represented today by \u00a7 7421(a)] with respect to the determination, assessment, and collection of Federal taxes.\u201d <footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Literally broader than \u00a7 7421(a) in its preclusion of tax oriented remedies, the \u00a7 2201 exception has literarily been found coterminus with that provided by \u00a7 7421(a). McGlotten v. Connally, 338 F.Supp. 448 (D.D.C.1972). <em>See also </em>Bullock v. Latham, 306 F.2d 45 (2d Cir. 1962), and Tomlinson v. Smith, 128 F.2d 808 (7th Cir. 1942). We believe that to be a correct interpretation, one soundly based on the history of the exception and on the paradoxicalness of authorizing injunctive relief while depriving courts the authority to declare the rights of the parties in connection with the injunctive relief. The breadth of the tax exception of \u00a7 2201 is eo-extensive with the effect of \u00a7 7421(a), and so the applicability of the latter to our situation is determinative of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1244-4\">2. <em>Individual Appellants</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1244-5\">The springboard of the action before us \u2014 namely that the removal of Americans United from the status of those corporations to whom tax deductible contributions can be made has wreaked havoc upon its financial stature \u2014 is the same for both the individual and corporate appellants. They seek to keep Americans United afloat. However, the posture of the appellants and the effect that the relief sought would have upon them is distinctively different. Stripped to its barest essentials, the individual appellants\u2019 relief relates directly to the assessment and collection of taxes. They seek, despite their averments that no taxes have been assessed and that this is a civil rights rather than tax case, to enjoin the appellee from assessing or collecting taxes on those dollars contributed by them to Americans United. In paragraph 3 of the relief portion of appellants\u2019 amended complaint this becomes evident:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1244-9\">[Plaintiffs pray that the following relief be granted:] Judgment enjoining defendant Thrower from enforcing Sections 170(c) and 501(c)(3) of Title 26 U.S.C.A., so as to deprive the individual plaintiffs and others similarly situated of the benefit of tax advantages in the exercise of their First Amendment rights by reason of the unconstitutionality of those sections.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1244-10\">The allegations that the tax will be assessed and collected in violation of their constitutional rights is to no avail. <em>See </em>Dodge v. Osborn, 240 U.S. 118, 36 S.Ct. 275, 60 L.Ed. 557 (1916); Harvey v. Early, 160 F.2d 836 (4th Cir. 1947); Moon v. Freeman, 245 F.Supp. 837 (E.D.Wash.1965); National Council on the Facts of Overpopulation v. Caplin, 224 F.Supp. 313 (D.D.C.1963). The allegation that no tax has as yet been assessed, and that therefore the action is somehow without \u00a7 7421(a), we find to be equally without merit. In the words of Chief Judge Sirica in <em>National Council, supra, </em>224 F.Supp. at 314, \u201c[t]he Court cannot agree that the immunity of a tax assessment from court-imposed restraint has anything to do with the timing of that restraint.\u201d Finally, the individual appellants have not shown the high probability of success on the merits that warrants the non-application of \u00a7 7421(a) under the standards enunciated in Enochs v. Williams Packing &amp; Navigation Co., Inc., 370 U.S. 1, 7, 82 S.Ct. 1125, 1129, 8 L.Ed.2d 292 (1962):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1244-11\">[I]f it is clear that under no circumstances could the Government ultimately prevail, the central purpose of the Act is inapplicable and, under the <em>Nut Margarine </em>case, [Miller v. Standard Nut Margarine Co., 284 U.S. 498, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1177\">*1177</page-number>52 S.Ct. 260, 76 L.Ed. 422 (1932)], the attempted collection may be enjoined if equity jurisdiction otherwise exists. In such a situation the exaction is merely in \u201cthe guise of a tax.\u201d <em>Id., </em>[284 U.S.] at 509 [52 S.Ct. at 263].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1245-5\">We believe that the question of whether the Government has a chance of ultimately prevailing is to be determined on the basis of the information available to it at the time of suit. Only if it is then apparent that, under the most liberal view of the law and the facts, the United States cannot establish its claim, may the suit for an injunction be maintained.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1245-6\">The action brought and the relief sought by the individual appellants directly ranges within the ambit of \u00a7 7421(a), and as to them the action of the district court in dismissing the case was correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b1245-7\">3. <em>Corporate Appellant</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1245-8\">Americans United, at the present time exempt from taxation on income by virtue of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 501(c)(4) (1970), does not seek in this lawsuit to enjoin the assessment or collection of its own taxes. Because of the \u201ctax breaks\u201d attendant to contributions to corporations qualifying under \u00a7 170(c) of the Code, qualification thereunder is a precious possession and removal from the Cumulative List, Organizations Described in Section 170(e) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 is a damaging \u2014 sometimes fatal \u2014 injury to the financial status of any \"charitable\u201d organization. Potential contributors with a minimum of business acumen are careful to get the most for their contributed dollar, and one certain way not to do so is to contribute to non-\u00a7 170 corporations. Appellant, therefore, presented with the dollar dilemma of finding prospective contributors closing their wallets, seeks to have the court restrain the Commissioner from meting \u00a7 501(c)(3) and \u00a7 170(c) qualifications in the alleged unconstitutional manner. A necessary side effect of any relief, of course, will be to allow contributions which otherwise would be made with after tax dollars to become deductible. Consequently, the appellee alleges that this is in essence a suit to restrain the assessment or collection of a tax and barred by \u00a7 7421(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b1245-10\">McGlotten v. Connally, 338 F.Supp. 448 (D.D.C.1972), involved a class action brought by a black American denied membership in an Elks Lodge because of his race. The plaintiff sought to enjoin the Secretary of Treasury from granting tax benefits to fraternal and nonprofit organizations which excluded nonwhites from membership. The statutes involved were similar to those in the case before us, granting various exemptions both to the organizations and their contributors. The plaintiff alleged that the statutes were either unconstitutional, unconstitutonally interpreted, or that the benefits granted thereby were in violation of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The defendant moved to dismiss citing \u00a7\u00a7 2201 and 7421(a), but a three-judge district court denied the motion. Chief Judge Bazelon, writing for the court, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1245-11\">Plaintiff\u2019s action has nothing to do with the collection or assessment of taxes. He does not contest the amount of his own tax, nor does he seek to limit the amount of tax revenue collectible by the United States. The preferred course of raising his objections in a suit for refund is not available. In this situation we cannot read the statute to bar the present suit. To hold otherwise would require the kind of ritualistic construction which the Supreme Court has repeatedly rejected. Even where the particular plaintiff objects to his own taxes, the Court has recognized that the literal terms of the statute do not apply when \u201cthe central purpose of the Act is inapplicable.\u201d In the present case, the central purpose is clearly inapplicable. It follows that neither \u00a7 7421(a) nor the exception to the Declaratory Judgment Act prohibits this suit.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1245-12\"><em>Id. </em>at 453-454 (footnotes omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1246-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1178\">*1178</page-number>A case from the opposite side of the restraint coin, wherein the Commissioner threatened to remove the tax exempt status of an organization because of racially discriminatory policies, is Bob Jones University v. Connally, 341 F.Supp. 277 (D.S.C.1971). Fearing that a drop in its level of contributions would cause irreparable harm, the University sought a preliminary injunction restraining the Commissioner from removing its \u00a7 501(e)(3) qualification. Faced with identical \u00a7\u00a7 2201 and 7421(a) arguments, the district judge granted the injunction. The court found that the gravamen of the plaintiff\u2019s complaint was not to ask the court to substitute its views for that of the Commissioner, <em>see </em>Jolles Foundation, Inc. v. Moysey, 250 F.2d 166 (2d Cir. 1957), but rather to prevent the Commissioner from acting \u201cbeyond the authority granted by the constitution or by the Congress, and to read into the Internal Revenue Laws powers that are not expressly given and that were never intended by Congress.\u201d 341 F.Supp. at 282-283. The court went on to state:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1246-4\">If there were no contest as to the legality or the power of the defendants to revoke under existing law plaintiff\u2019s tax exempt status because of its admitted racial discriminatory admissions policy, but was instead a case involving the applicability of such a rule to the plaintiff, it would then appear to be a case where this court was asked to preempt discretionary power of a federal officer which it would be powerless to do. . . . Plaintiff is not challenging the applicability of the rule, but the legality of the rule itself.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1246-6\">Bob Jones University is not seeking a declaratory judgment, but rather seeks to enjoin the defendants from exercising alleged illegal and <em>ultra vires </em>power and authority. Consequently, it is concluded that the levy, assessment, and collection of a tax is not the main issue. Plaintiff does not contest the amount or method of any levy, assessment, or collection, or evidence to be used in making such determination of taxes that might become due. Plaintiff is seeking to enjoin what it contends to be illegal and unconstitutional actions or threatened actions on the part of officials of the United States Government which it claims would lead to irreparable harm . . . .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1246-8\"><em>Id. at </em>283.</p>\n<p id=\"b1246-9\">Here, as in <em>Bob Jones, </em>the essence of appellants\u2019 attack is not against the applicability of a test or their ability to qualify under presently existing standards. As the appellee correctly points out in his brief, \u201c[appellants] do not seriously contend that Americans United qualifies under Section 501(c)(3) as written. Rather, they contend that the clause disqualifying organizations which devote a substantial part of their activities to political propaganda and lobbying should be elided as unconstitutional, and they seek a declaratory judgment to that effect.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1246-10\">Appellee principally relies upon Jolles Foundation, Inc. v. Moysey, <em>supra. </em>Although there is language in <em>Jolles </em>regarding \u00a7 2201 we believe it to be distinguishable and not persuasive. In <em>Jolles </em>the appellant alleged that the Commissioner erred in his determination of its tax exempt qualification, and brought an action which the court correctly viewed as in the nature of mandamus \u201cagainst the Commissioner to compel him to reverse his position based upon the activities of the Foundation already held not to come within the exemption . . . . \u201d 250 F.2d at 169. We submit that the <em>Jolles </em>case did not involve the alleged unconstitutionality of a taxing statute, but a challenge respecting the judgment of the Commissioner, and manifestly \u201cthe court cannot presume to speak for the Commissioner or take over his duty to pass upon the tax status of organizations applying for exemption.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1246-12\">Here, as in <em>McGlotten </em>and <em>Bob Jones, </em>no tax has been or will be assessed against the corporate appellant. The restraint upon assessment and collection is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1179\">*1179</page-number>at best a collateral effect of the action, the primary design not being to remove the burden of taxation from those presently contributing but rather to avoid the disposition of contributed funds away from the corporation. The corporation, alleging constitutional violations of an identical nature to that of the individual appellants, irreparable injury, and an inadequate legal remedy,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> does so in a posture removed from a restraint on assessment or collection. We find, as did the courts in Bob <em>Jones, McGlotten, </em>and impliedly the court in Green v. Kennedy, 309 F.Supp. 1127 (D.D.C.1970), on permanent injunction, Green v. Connally, 330 F.Supp. 1150 (D.D.C.1971), aff\u2019d per curiam, Coit v. Green, 404 U.S. 997, 92 S.Ct. 564, 30 L.Ed.2d 550 (1971),<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> that it would be an all too encompassing interpretation of \u00a7 7421(a) to consider it as precluding a suit of this nature, and refuse to so hold.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1247-12\">We do not adopt the doctrine that \u00a7 7421(a) is inapplicable so long as a party does not seek to restrain the collection or assessment of its own taxes. Our holding is much narrower. In those situations where a non-taxpayer sues in the stead of the taxpayer,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> <em>e. g., </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1180\">*1180</page-number>the shareholder suits brought on behalf of a reluctant corporation, Corbus v. Alaska Treadwell Gold Mining Co., 187 U.S. 455, 464, 23 S.Ct. 157, 47 L.Ed. 256 (1903), <em>cf., </em>Helvering v. Davis, 301 U.S. 619, 639-640, 57 S.Ct. 904, 81 L.Ed. 1307 (1937), or where the tax itself directly operates to place a financial burden upon the non-taxpayer, e. <em>g., </em>where the valuation of an estate for estate tax purposes would affect the tax liability of a non-taxpayer at a future date, West Chester Feed &amp; Supply Co. v. Erwin, 438 F.2d 929 (6th Cir. 1971), when a tax levied upon processing oil would directly affect one about to enter the processing business, Gardner v. Helvering, 66 App.D.C. 364, 88 F.2d 746 (1936), cert. denied, 301 U.S. 684, 57 S.Ct. 784, 81 L.Ed. 1342 (1937), <em>au fond </em>it is a suit to restrain the collection or assessment of a tax \u201cindirectly\u201d levied upon the plaintiff, and within the purpose and proscription of \u00a7 7421(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b1248-4\">What we have then is a hybrid sort of fellow. The challenge upon which we reverse runs not to the exercise of discretion or the everyday working affairs of the Commission, something we feel history and good sense implore us to leave alone, nor is it concerned with taxes levied either directly or \u201cindirectly\u201d upon the corporate appellant, something which \u00a7 7421(a) mandates us to leave alone.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Finally, an alternate legal remedy in the form of adequate refund litigation is unavailable. The lack, of a meaningful alternate form of relief is important herein for two reasons: first, its absence solidifies our belief that the situation <em>sub judice </em>is without the purpose and expected scope of \u00a7 7421(a), and second, its absence renders equitable relief most appropriate. We suspect that the birthrate of such a hybrid will be so low that the proverbial \u201cflood gates\u201d to judicial review of Internal Revenue Service action will remain closed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1248-8\">4. <em>Sovereign Immunity</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1248-9\">Appellee, relying chiefly upon Louisiana v. McAdoo, 234 U.S. 627, 34 S.Ct. 938, 58 L.Ed. 1506 (1914), urges the court to recognize this suit as one against the United States to which consent has not been given, and hence barred by the doctrine of sovereign immunity. We feel that the appellee has failed to recognize this suit as rightly falling within the exceptions to the doctrine as reiterated by the Supreme Court in Dugan v. Rank, 372 U.S. 609, 622, 83 S.Ct. 999, 10 L.Ed.2d 15 (1963). Those exceptions relate to (1) actions by officers beyond their statutory powers, and (2) actions within the scope of their authority, when the powers themselves or the manner in which they are exercised are constitutionally void. The appellants do not challenge the right of the Commissioner to adopt rules and regulations, but they do challenge his right to enforce a statute which they assert violates various constitutional liberties. This clearly falls within the \u201cexception\u201d almost as broad as the \u201crule,\u201d that \u201csovereign immunity does not prevent a suit against a state or federal officer who is acting either beyond his authority or in violation of the Constitution.\u201d <footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1249-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1181\">*1181</page-number>III. SUBSTANTIAL CONSTITUTIONAL QUESTION</p>\n<p id=\"b1249-5\">The single district court judge below denied appellants\u2019 motion to convene a three-judge panel pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2282 (1970), for the stated reason that the challenge raised no substantial constitutional questions. We reverse and remand with respect to the only remaining appellant in this litigation, Americans United, with instructions to promptly convene a \u00a7 2282 panel.</p>\n<p id=\"b1249-6\">In Bulluck v. Washington, 152 U.S.App.D.C. 39, 468 F.2d 1096 (1972), rehearing en banc, July 14, 1972, we have recently had an opportunity to restate the scope of a district court\u2019s inquiry (and consequently our scope of review) when confronted with an application for a \u00a7 2282 panel. The court is limited to questioning (1) whether the constitutional questions raised are substantial, which in turn is limited to a determination of whether they are \u201cobviously without merit\u201d or so clearly unsound by reason of previous decisions of the Supreme Court \u201cas to foreclose the subject and leave no room for the inference that the question sought to be raised can be the subject of controversy.\u201d Ex Parte Poresky, 290 U.S. 30, 32, 54 S.Ct. 3, 4, 78 L.Ed. 152 (1933); (2) whether the complaint at least formally alleges a basis for equitable relief; and (3) whether the case presented otherwise comes within the requirements of the three-judge panel. Idlewild Bon Voyage Corp. v. Epstein, 370 U.S. 713, 715, 82 S.Ct. 1294, 8 L.Ed.2d 794 (1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b1249-13\">As our discussion of the case to this point has shown, what appellant effectively seeks here is a restraint on the enforcement of the \u201csubstantial part\u201d clause of \u00a7 501(c)(3). It accomplishes this by seeking a declaratory judgment that the section is unconstitutional, and by requesting injunctive relief to force the Commissioner to reclassify it and other similarly situated corporations as tax exempt if they are found to qualify. This type of action, affecting legislation of broad regulatory scope and amounting to a restraint on its enforcement as written and interpreted, is within the \u00a7 2282 mandate. Satisfied that the other requirements for the three-judge panel are present, and that equitable relief is properly requested, we turn to the substantiality question.</p>\n<p id=\"b1249-14\">Although as can be seen from our earlier listing<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> appellants originally raised a multitude of possible constitutional violations, at oral argument and in its Reply Brief it has narrowed its focus, and we believe wisely so, to the \u201cdiscriminatory\u201d aspects of \u00a7 501(c)(3). Basically, this is that since larger, wealthier organizations can engage in conduct identical to that of appellant without, because of their size, falling within the \u201csubstantial part\u201d category of \u00a7 501(c)(3) and thereby losing their precious tax exempt status (and more precious listing <em>among </em>those corporations to whom tax free contributions can be made), \u00a7 501(c)(3) is unconstitutionally discriminatory in violation of the equal protection ramifications of the due process clause of the fifth amendment. <em>See </em>Bolling v. Sharpe, 347 U.S. 497, 74 S.Ct. 693, 98 L.Ed. 844 (1954).<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> We find <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1182\">*1182</page-number>such a claim, novel as it may be, neither obviously without merit nor foreclosed by previous Supreme Court decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1250-4\">Appellee relies chiefly upon Cammarano v. United States, 358 U.S. 498, 79 S.Ct. 524, 3 L.Ed.2d 462 (1959), but <em>Cammarano, </em>while disposing of appellants\u2019 claim that first amendment rights are violated by the questioned statute, does not attempt to deal with possible discriminatory conduct. In <em>Cammarano </em>liquor dealers had expended funds in advertising campaigns against statutory resolutions in Washington and Arkansas which would have effectively closed their businesses, and sought to deduct their costs as ordinary business expenses. The lower courts ruled that \u201cthe payments . . . were \u2018expended for . the . . . defeat of legislation\u2019 within the meaning of Treas.Reg. 111, \u00a7 29.23(0)-1 and were therefore not deductible as ordinary and necessary business expenses under \u00a7 23(a)(1)(A) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 501, 79 S.Ct. at 527. The court, per Justice Harlan, continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1250-7\">Petitioners are not being denied a tax deduction because they engage in constitutionally protected activities, but are simply being re\u00b0quired to pay for those activities entirely out of their own pockets, as everyone else engaging in similar activities is required to do under the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code. Nondiscriminatory denial of deduction from gross income to sums expended to promote or defeat legislation is plainly not \u201c \u2018aimed at the suppression of dangerous ideas.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1250-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 513, 79 S.Ct. at 533. Americans United, on the other hand, alleges just that discriminatory conduct found lacking in <em>Cammarano. </em>This discrimination relates solely to the \u201csize\u201d of the organization, which appellants allege is directly related to its wealth and power structure, and comes into play during and because of the exercise of first amendment protected liberties. By allowing larger, richer organizations more \u201cdollar punch\u201d in terms of \u201cpropagandizing\u201d and \u201cinfluencing legislation\u201d before their respective activities are considered \u201csubstantial,\u201d the Commissioner is accused of following the mandate of \u00a7 501(c)(3) and treating identical activity differently, solely on the basis of the size, or wealth, of the acting party.</p>\n<p id=\"b1250-12\">Nearly every jurist and attorney today is aware of the flood of cases before the bench raising important questions, at least in the context of the fourteenth amendment equal protection clause, concerning the interpretation of \u201cfundamental rights,\u201d \u201csuspect categories,\u201d and their resultant \u201ccompelling state interest test.\u201d A case similar to the redoubtable Serrano v. Priest, 5 Cal.3d 584, 96 Cal. Rptr. 601, 487 P.2d 1241 (1971), which struck down California\u2019s system of public school financing as violative of the fourteenth amendment, and straightforwardly classified both \u201cwealth\u201d and \u201ceducation\u201d as categories calling for stricter justification in terms of equal protection, is presently submitted before the United States Supreme Court. San Antonio Independent School District v. Rodriguez, 411 U.S. 1, 93 S.Ct. 1278, 36 L.Ed.2d 16 (1972). The Court\u2019s decision in that case should prove most instructive in an area of concern before us \u2014\u201cdiscrimination\u201d of this type as within the \u201cwealth\u201d category, and the status of \u201cwealth\u201d as giving rise to the compelling interest test.</p>\n<p id=\"b1250-13\">If discrimination exists here it relates to the exercise of the most fundamental of rights, those protected by the first amendment,<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> and raises questions concerning the directness of its relationship <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1183\">*1183</page-number>to wealth. We are aware that the various tests of which we speak have arisen in the context of the fourteenth amendment, but find that they are nonetheless relevant to the consideration of whether the government has exercised its taxing powers in such a discriminatory fashion as to violate the due process guaranties of the fifth amendment. This is neither a frivolous challenge nor one which, as of the writing of this opinion, has been foreclosed by the Supreme Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1251-5\">We want to stress that our opinion is in no way meant to state our views of the merits of this case beyond that required: namely, that the possibility of success is not so certain as to merit the <em>Enochs </em>exception with respect to \u00a7 7421(a), yet not so frivolous or foreclosed as to merit denial of the \u00a7 2282 motion. The discrimination problem may ultimately prove to be a mirage, or even a muddle, but it certainly is not maggot-pated.- The question merits a three-judge panel.</p>\n<p id=\"b1251-6\">Reversed and remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1240-6\">. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 501(c) (3) (1970):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1240-7\">Corporations, and any community chest, fund, or foundation, organized and operated exclusively for religious, charitable, scientific, testing for public safety, literary, or educational purposes, or for the prevention of cruelty to children or animals, no part of the net earnings of which inures to the benefit of any private shareholder or individual, no substantial part of the activities of which is carrying on propaganda, or otherwise attempting, to influence legislation, and which does not participate in, or intervene in (including the publishing or distributing of statements), any political campaign on behalf of any candidate for public office.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1240-8\">.

Since Americans United qualifies as a tax exempt organization pursuant to \u00a7 501 (c)(4) of the Code, the normal avenue of challenge, tax refund litigation, is not available. Appellee in his Supplemental Memorandum and at oral presentation has for the first time suggested two additional \u201cadequate\u201d legal remedies available to the appellant corporation. These are the federal social security and unemployment tax refund litigations, since \u00a7 501(c)(3) organizations are exempt from both taxes while \u00a7 501(c)(4) organizations are exempt from neither.</p>\n<p id=\"b1247-8\">Appellant points out that although not required to pay social security taxes while exempt under \u00a7 501(c) (3), it elected to do so. A termination of such an election requires two years advance notice and cannot be made if the election has been in effect more than eight years, as it was here. Moreover, under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 3121 (k) (3) (1970), an organization which once terminates its election to pay those taxes voluntarily cannot renew the election. Although the unemployment tax refund litigation is not fraught with perils of equal magnitude, it is subject to certain conditions and, we feel, is so far removed from the mainstream of the action and relief sought as to hardly be considered adequate.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b1247-10\">. <em>Green, </em>involved a class action brought by black students and their parents to enjoin the Secretary of Treasury from granting tax exempt status to private schools discriminating against blacks. A three-judge district court was convened and, Judge Leventhal writing, determined that the Internal Revenue Code could not be interpreted as granting a tax exempt status to such organizations. Although faced with governmental insistence that the relief sought was barred by \u00a7\u00a7 2201 and 7421(a), the court did not address the problem but granted the injunctive relief. The ease was affirmed <em>per curiam </em>and without opinion by the Supreme Court, but as by that time the Commissioner had \u201cvoluntarily\u201d altered the rules to comply with the decision, and the government did not press the appeal, the precise force and effect of the affirmance is questionable.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b1247-14\">. The ultimate effect of the <em>Green </em>and <em>McGlotten </em>litigations was to increase the tax revenue of the United States, while at least theoretically the effect of <em>Bob Jones </em>and the case at hand is to decrease the tax revenue. We do not believe, and ajjpellee has in fact agreed, that such a fact is of distinguishable merit. It is untenable that a party seeking to have an entire section declared unconstitutional, thus removing the exemption and theoretically increasing the tax revenue, should be treated differently from one seeking to remedy the discriminatory underinclusion by striking the unconstitutional clause, and thus theoretically decreasing the tax revenue.</p>\n<p id=\"b1247-15\">In reaching our conclusion regarding the applicability of \u00a7 7421(a) we have considered, and found unpersuasive, the decisions in Liberty Amendment Committee of the U.S.A. v.

Thompson, 394 U.S. 618, 89 S.Ct. 1322, 22 L.Ed.2d 600 (1969), is that \u201c[w]hile <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1182\">*1182</page-number>the Fifth Amendment contains no equal protection clause, it does forbid discrimination that is \u2018so unjustifiable as to be violative of due process.\u2019 \u201d 377 U.S. at 168, 84 S.Ct. at 1190.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b1250-14\">. <em>See </em>dissent of Marshall, J., in California v.

Although other statutes are relevant, the vital statute at issue is 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 501(c)(3) (1970), quoted in footnote one of the court\u2019s opinion. Making a careful analysis of this statute, the first part states why tax exemption is granted \u2014 and that relates to the <em>purpose </em>of the organization. Thereafter are listed several factors which will nullify the tax-exempt status granted by the first part of \u00a7 501(c)(3). One of the disqualifications for tax-exempt status is expressed in the phrase, \u201c. . .no substantial part of the activities of which is carrying on propaganda, or otherwise attempting, to influence legislation, . . . \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1251-13\">And this disqualification phrase is what this case is all about. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 501(c)(3) <em>first </em>ties tax status to the <em>purpose </em>of the organization \u2014 and the \u201cno substantial . . . influence legislation\u201d disqualification test (like the disqualification reference to private earnings or political campaigns) <em>is aimed at assuring some purity in that purpose.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1251-15\">It is arguable that a small organization that spends almost all of its funds lobbying is not organized or conducted for the same purpose as a large organization, which may spend quantitatively as much, but which proportionately devotes most of its activities to unquestionably exempt purposes. If we make an analysis by following the impact of the donor\u2019s dollar, a gift to \u201cAmericans United\u201d has \u201cmore punch\u201d on the legis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1184\">*1184</page-number>lative front than a gift to a large church organization which spends only 1% of its income on lobbying activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b1252-4\">In that sense, the large organization is not engaged in what can reasonably be called \u201cidentical conduct.\u201d The statute does not give any greater privilege of speech to large organizations \u2014 other than the greater amount of impact any group can have if it raises more money. Rather, the interpretation of equal protection sought by \u201cAmericans United\u201d would give a greater right of speech \u2014 by emasculating the \u201cpurpose\u201d rationale of \u00a7 501(e)(3) \u2014 to small organizations. We cannot ignore the \u201cpurpose\u201d rationale, because <em>purpose </em>is the <em>only </em>ground for tax exemption under \u00a7 501(c)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b1252-6\">Furthermore, if the larger groups are seen as engaged in \u201cidentical conduct\u201d \u2014what is to be the bench mark? If the purpose of the tax statute is to be preserved at all, then the large church organizations probably must hold to devoting a small percentage of their resources to lobbying. Is that <em>quantitative </em>amount then to guide \u2014 so that a small organization, with total funds amounting only to the tiny percentage which the large organization devotes to this purpose, could devote 100% of its funds to lobbying and still be exempt?</p>\n<p id=\"b1252-7\">In short, it is certainly arguable that small groups are not being treated differently by \u00a7 501(c)(3) because they are small, but because they are obviously operating for a different purpose if they devote their comparatively small funds on a much different proportionate basis to propaganda for legislation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1252-8\">I have raised the issue above by stating only one side of the argument. There are, of course, counterarguments.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We are not here deciding this or any other issue on the merits, but since neither party has seen fit to bring this issue to the courts\u2019 attention, I feel it of sufficient importance to raise it for such consideration as the three-judge court and parties may wish to give it.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1252-9\">. Some counterarguments may be derived from William G. Ilalby\u2019s article, \u201cIs the Income Tax Unconstitutionally Discriminatory?\u201d, 58 A.B.A.J. 1291 (December, 1972). Others may be inspired by the reflection that, if 200 years ago men revoltecl on the principie that \u201cTaxation without representation is tyranny\u201d, then today men may rise in righteous wrath because taxation with representation but beyond human comprehension is even worse.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
