The eases were consolidated there after this court vacated a summary judgment in favor of the defendant and remanded the first of these actions.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b160-20\">The district court held both plans to be violative of the Act and ordered the company to cease and desist from discriminating between men and women as to retirement benefits.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> However, no award of compensatory damages was made. The plaintiffs have appealed from the denial of monetary relief; the company has cross appealed from the remainder of the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-21\">A pension plan was first instituted by the company in 1911.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> According to its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>terms a female was permitted to retire on full pension at age sixty if she had completed twenty years of service. A male, in order to receive full benefits, was required to have attained the age of sixty-five and to have served at least twenty-five years. Early retirement was available to a man at sixty only if he had served thirty years and then only at a reduced pension. Women were discriminated against in that their mandatory retirement age was sixty-five whereas their male counterparts could continue working until age seventy. The first plan was revised as the result of collective bargaining between the defendant and representatives of its employees.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b161-12\">The revised version which took effect on May 1, 1967, perpetuated the discriminatory features of the 1911 plan only to the extent that it favored women hired prior to its effective date. The controversial section provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b161-13\">\u201c* * * in the case of a female employee who retires under the provisions of this Section 4, no reduction in the amount of the pension shall be made on account of service prior to May 1, 1967.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b161-15\">Under this plan the mandatory retirement age for all is seventy.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>STANDING</p>\n<p id=\"b162-4\"> On appeal the standing of the plaintiffs to maintain this suit is questioned. Standing \u201cconcerns * * * the question whether the interest sought to be protected by the complainant is arguably within the zone of interests to be protected or regulated by the statute or constitutional guarantee in question.\u201d Association of Data Processing Service Organizations, Inc. v. Camp, 397 U.S. 150, 153, 90 S.Ct. 827, 830, 25 L.Ed.2d 184 (1970). The substantive issues must be considered to ascertain whether \u201cthere is a logical nexus between the status asserted and the claim sought to be adjudicated.\u201d Flast v. Cohen, 392 U.S. 83, 102, 88 S.Ct. 1942, 1953, 20 L.Ed.2d 947 (1968). Standing for purposes of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 was intended by Congress to be defined as broadly as is permitted by Article III of the Constitution. Hackett v. McGuire Brothers Inc., 445 F.2d 442 (C.A.3 1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b162-6\">Rosen, the company contends, lost standing to contest the alleged discriminatory practices when he retired. We do not agree. He was an active employee when this action was commenced and does not lose standing merely by accepting his pension. Hackett, supra; see Jenkins v. United Gas Corp., 400 F. 2d 28 (C.A.5, 1968). As one who was subject to the discriminatory provisions of the pension plans under consideration he has standing. Sweeney, an active male employee, also has a sufficient personal stake in the outcome of this case to assure that concrete adverseness will occur. See Kalur v. Resor, 335 F.Supp. 1 (D.D.C.1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b162-7\">The company urges that the union has standing to represent neither the active employees nor the pensioners. Since both these classes are represented by other plaintiffs, we need not decide whose rights the union, as bargaining representative of the company\u2019s employees, has standing to assert.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark>- See Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, 8 Duq. L.Rev. 1(1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b162-11\">DISCRIMINATION</p>\n<p id=\"A7y\">Section 703(a)(1) of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 states that it is an unlawful employment practice to discriminate on the basis of sex \u201cagainst any individual with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-2(a) (1); see Employment \u2014 Sex Discrimination, 12 A.L.R. Fed. 15 (1972). Whether retirement plans fall within the purview of the above language is the threshold question in this case. We answer it in the affirmative.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-12\">The EEOC which is charged with the responsibility of administering the Act has issued the following guideline.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-13\">\u201cIt shall be an unlawful employment practice for an employer to have a pension or retirement plan which establishes different optional or compulsory retirement ages based on sex, or which differentiates in benefits on the basis of sex.\u201d 37 Fed.Reg. 6837 (1972).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b162-14\">Such an administrative interpretation is entitled to great deference. Griggs v. Duke Power Co., 401 U.S. 424, 433-434, 91 S.Ct. 849, 28 L.Ed.2d 158 (1971); Udall v. Tallman, 380 U.S. 1, 85 S.Ct. 792, 13 L.Ed.2d 616 (1965). That the guideline was not promulgated until after this suit was initiated is of no moment. Rights which came into being when the Act was passed are not abro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>gated by administrative interpretation. Bartmess v. Drewrys U.S.A., Inc., 444 F.2d 1186 (C.A.7), cert. denied, 404 U.S. 939, 92 S.Ct. 274, 30 L.Ed.2d 252 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b163-3\">A reading of the statute convinces us that the commission\u2019s interpretation furthers the legislative purpose of the Act and is consistent with the plain meaning of the language employed.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-4\">\u201cCongress intended to strike at the entire spectrum of disparate treatment of men and women resulting from sex stereotypes.\u201d Sprogis v. United Air Lines, Inc., 444 F.2d 1194, 1198 (C.A.7), cert. denied, 404 U.S. 991, 92 S.Ct. 536, 30 L.Ed.2d 543 (1971).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">Persuasive, also, is the fact that the language in the Labor-Management Relations Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 159(a), similar to that employed in \u00a7 703(a)(1) of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, has been held to include retirement benefits. Inland Steel Co. v. NLRB, 170 F.2d 247 (C.A.7 1948), cert. denied, 336 U.S. 960, 69 S.Ct. 887, 93 L.Ed. 1112 (1949).</p>\n<p id=\"b163-6\">We hold, therefore, that \u00a7 703(a)(1) of the Act prohibits discrimination with respect to retirement benefits on the basis of sex. Other courts are in agreement with us on this point. Bartmess, supra; Fillinger v. East Ohio Gas Co., (E.D.O.1971). Clearly the plans in question violate the Act. They differentiate between men and women solely on the basis of sex, and such discrimination is prohibited. Rosenfeld v. Southern Pacific Co., 444 F.2d 1219 (C.A.9, 1971); Lansdale v. Air Line Pilots Association International, 430 F.2d 1341 (C.A.5, 1970); Bowe v. Colgate-Palmolive Co., 416 F.2d 711 (C.A.7, 1969); but cf. Gruenwald v. Gardner, 390 F.2d 591 (C.A.2), cert. denied, 393 U.S. 982, 89 S.Ct. 456, 21 L.Ed.2d 445 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b163-7\">We find no merit in the company\u2019s argument that the revised plan is valid because it resulted from collective bargaining.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-9\">\"The rights assured by Title VII are not rights which can be bargained away \u2014 either by a union, by an employer, or by both acting in concert.\u201d Robinson v. Lorillard Corp., 444 F.2d 791, 799 (C.A.4), cert. dismissed, 404 U.S. 1006, 92 S.Ct. 573, 30 L.Ed.2d 655 (1971); see United Mine Workers of America v. Pennington, 381 U.S. 657, 85 S.Ct. 1585, 14 L.Ed.2d 626 (1965); United States v. St. Louis-San Francisco Ry. Co., 464 F.2d 301 (C.A.8, 1972), cert. denied 409 U.S. 1116, 93 S.Ct. 913, 34 L.Ed.2d 700 (1973)<em>.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b163-10\">Nor, as the company contends, does the revised plan\u2019s provision for gradually phasing out the discrimination bring it into compliance with the Act. See 37 Fed.Reg. 6837 (1972); United States v. H. K. Porter Co., 296 F.Supp. 40 (N.D.Ala.1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b163-11\">The revised plan, according to the company, merely preserves pre-existing rights of females which cannot be diminished. This may be true. The apparent effect of \u00a7 15 of the pension plan and Article XVII of the collective bargaining agreement is to bar the company from reducing the benefits of females. However, the company is not precluded from raising men\u2019s benefits to the level of women in order to achieve equality. Such adjustments have been recognized as a proper means of achieving that end. Hays v. Potlatch Forests, Inc., 465 F.2d 1081 (C.A.8, 1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b163-12\">REMEDY</p>\n<p id=\"b163-13\">On appeal the plaintiffs argue that compensatory damages should have been awarded to males who retired early under either of the discriminatory plans. With this we agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-14\">Section 706(g) provides that the court \u201cmay enjoin * * * and order such affirmative action as may be appropriate.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(g).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> \u201cThis grant of authority <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>should be broadly read and applied so as to effectively terminate the practice and make its victims whole.\u201d Bowe v. Colgate-Palmolive Co., 416 F.2d 711, 721 (C.A.7, 1969). The relief is intended to restore those wronged to their rightful economic status absent the effects of the unlawful discrimination. Robinson v. Lorillard Corp., 444 F.2d 791 (C.A.4), cert. dismissed, 404 U.S. 1006, 92 S.Ct. 573, 30 L.Ed.2d 655 (1971). We are under a duty to render relief which will eliminate the \u201cdiscriminatory effects of the past as well as bar like discrimination in the future.\u201d Louisiana v. United States, 380 U.S. 145, 154, 85 S.Ct. 817, 822, 13 L.Ed.2d 709 (1965); see Smith v. Young Men\u2019s Christian Association, 462 F.2d 634 (C.A.5, 1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b164-4\">Male employees did retire early under both versions of the pension plan.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> These men now receive reduced pensions whereas women who retired under identical circumstances receive full benefits. The effective date of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 was July 2, 1965. Men who have retired since that date with annuities reduced below those which they would have received had they been women must be compensated for the losses they sustained and are sustaining due to the discriminatory reduction in the amount of pensions on account of service prior to May 1, 1967, the effective date of the revised retirement plan, and after the effective date of the Act. Further, since we are of the view that the pension rights of active women employees which accrue before May 1, 1967, cannot be diminished, we hold that the retirement credit of males similarly situated must be increased for the relevant period between July 2, 1965, and May 1, 1967. This must be done to cure the effects of discrimination since the effective date of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-8\">Other courts have invoked equitable powers under the Act to bring one group of employees up to the economic level of another. Victims of sex discrimination have been awarded three years\u2019 wages which were lost due to early retirement. Fillinger v. East Ohio Gas Co., (N.D.O. 1971). Overtime benefits have been extended to male employees where state law required that women receive overtime pay. Hays v. Potlatch Forests, Inc., 465 F.2d 1081 (C.A.8, 1972); see Schaeffer v. San Diego Yellow Cabs, Inc., 462 F.2d 1002 (C.A.9, 1972). Further, the relief to be granted in the instant case is consistent with this court\u2019s decisions under the Equal Pay Act which serves the' same fundamental purpose as the Civil Rights Act of 1964. See Hodgson v. Wheaton Glass Co., 446 F.2d 527 (C.A.3, 1971). In <em>Hodgson </em>we affirmed the judgment which awarded damages to effectuate the equalization of wage rates.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-9\">For the foregoing reasons this cause will be remanded to the district court for a determination of the damages consistent with this opinion.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b160-11\">.

Section 2000e-2(a) provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-13\">\u201cIt shall be an unlawful employment practice for an employer. \u2014 -(1) to fail or refuse to hire or discharge any individual, or otherwise to discriminate against any individual with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, because of such individual\u2019s race, color, religion, sex, or national origin. * * * \u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b160-14\">.

Public Service Electric and Gas Co., 409 F.2d 775 (C.A.3 1969). The attack on the first pension plan was initiated by filing a charge of discrimination with the EEOC on November 15, 1965. On March 9, 1966, following unsuccessful conciliatory efforts by the commission, suit was entered in the first of the captioned cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-23\">Subsequently, the complaint was amended to include in its scope the discriminatory feature of the modified pension plan. On appeal, this court remanded the first case with the suggestion that it be consolidated with a second suit filed on September 20, 1968, which raised the same issues as the amendment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b160-24\">.
