Appellants now assert an additional claim that their second trial, which resulted in their convictions, subjected them to double jeopardy in violation of the Fifth Amendment, since appellants\u2019 first trial was improperly aborted while in its third day. We reject these contentions and affirm the determination of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-5\">While the district court opinion clearly demonstrates that appellants\u2019 claims were without merit, we add an additional comment relating to the double jeopardy claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-6\">The district court aborted the first trial on February 12, 1969, when during cross-examination of defendant Carl Roberts, the prosecutor elicited background information about Carl\u2019s prior felony convictions. Carl\u2019s lawyer, who also represented Roy, moved for a mistrial because of certain comments made by the court. The lawyer representing two other defendants joined in the motion. The trial court then granted the mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-7\">A claim of double jeopardy in violation of the Fifth Amendment does not arise from the later trial of a defendant, following a mistrial declared by the court upon the defendant\u2019s own motion. See United States v. Tateo, 377 U.S. 463, 467, 84 S.Ct. 1587, 12 L.Ed.2d 448 (1964); United States v. Pappas, 445 F.2d 1194, 1200 (3d Cir. 1971), cert. denied sub nom., Mischlich v. United States, 404 U.S. 984, 92 S.Ct. 449, 30 L.Ed.2d 368 (1971); Houp v. State of Nebraska, 427 F.2d 254, 255 (8th Cir. 1970), cert. denied, 401 U.S. 924, 91 S.Ct. 887, 27 L.Ed.2d 827 (1971); Gregory v. United States, 133 U.S.App.D.C. 317, 410 F.2d 1016, 1018 (1969), cert. denied, 396 U.S. 865, 90 S.Ct. 143, 24 L. Ed.2d 119 (1969); Vacarro v. United States, 360 F.2d 606, 608 (5th Cir. 1966). <em>Gf. </em>United States v. Jorn, 400 U.S. 470, 91 S.Ct. 547, 27 L.Ed.2d 543 (1971); Gori v. United States, 367 U.S. 364, 81 S.Ct. 1523, 6 L.Ed.2d 901 (1961).</p>\n<p id=\"b613-22\">The problem here arises from the joint representation of Carl and Roy by one attorney. The motion for mistrial was not specifically requested on behalf of both defendants and was made while Carl was being questioned about his prior convictions. The request was based upon comments of the court which might be deemed critical of the trial tactics of the attorney.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Such comments, if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>taken as critical of the attorney\u2019s conduct, would seem to taint the proceedings for all parties represented by the attorney. Roy made no objection to his retrial on double jeopardy grounds until this present posteonviction petition. Under these circumstances we think it clearly inferable that counsel\u2019s mistrial request asked for a mistrial for both his clients, Roy and Carl, and that the court granted the request in the interest of all the defendants. <em>See and compare </em>United States v. Walden, 448 F.2d 925, 930 (4th Cir. 1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b614-4\">Thus, the record discloses no violation of appellants\u2019 rights under the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b612-16\">. The convictions as to these and other defendants were affirmed on direct appeal in United States v. Leach, 429 F.2d 956 (8th Cir. 1970), cert. denied, 402 U.S. 986, 91 S.Ct. 1675, 29 L.Ed.2d 151 (1971).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b613-8\">.

BRUNTRAGER: I don\u2019t think that was a proper question, but anyway I am objecting to the Court pointing out to the jury by his question that I did not ask him. There was a specific reason for my not asking him. I cannot explain this to the jury, but in any event, inasmuch as the Court has pointed out, that it appears, it must appear to the jury, Your Honor, that I have been hiding this, or attempting to hide it, which is not true, and I would ask that the Court instruct the jury, or admonish the jury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>to disregard the question asked of counsel, not to place any significance on it, and I would ask that a mistrial he declared.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A_6\">MR.
