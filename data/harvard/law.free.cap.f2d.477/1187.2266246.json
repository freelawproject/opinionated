ROBINSON, III, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b1260-8\">This appeal tenders for resolution questions as to the examinatorial entitlements of the criminally accused at federal preliminary hearings. Appellants, Lawrence D. Coleman, Jorge D. Dancis and Ronald Shepard, were arrested and charged <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> with the commission of unrelated crimes within the District of Columbia. Following arrest, each was brought before a judicial officer<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> for the proceedings prescribed by then Rule 5 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Coleman and Dancis each sought, and each was denied, a subpoena requiring the attendance at his preliminary hearing of the only apparent eyewitness to his alleged offenses. Shepard, during his preliminary hearing, was restricted in cross-examination of the complainant and a corroborating Government witness, and in the presentation of evidence of his own.</p>\n<p id=\"b1260-16\">Subsequent to the preliminary hearings, the three appellants joined in a class-action complaint in the District Court. They sought declaratory judgments that the preliminary hearings were defective, writs of mandamus reopening them, and an injunction restraining, pendente lite, presentation of their cases for grand jury consideration.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The District Court denied a preliminary injunction and dismissed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1193\">*1193</page-number>the action,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and this appeal ensued. For reasons which follow, we reverse the District Court's judgment to the extent that it denied a declaration that Dancis\u2019 preliminary hearing was faulty and remand the case in order that the declaration may be made. In all other respects we affirm, but without prejudice to rectification in the criminal proceeding pending against Dancis of the error committed at his preliminary hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1261-5\">Some of the questions advanced on appeal are common to the cases of two or more of the three appellants.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Each appeal, however, also tenders an issue not present in either of the others. We therefore treat the three cases separately.</p>\n<p id=\"b1261-6\">I. COLEMAN\u2019S APPEAL</p>\n<p id=\"b1261-7\">After joining in this appeal, Coleman was indicted in two bills for multiple violations of the federal narcotic laws.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Two days before oral argument on the appeal, he entered a plea of guilty to two counts, one in each of the two indictments.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> He insists that his preliminary hearing, at which the charges laid in one of the indictments were aired, was fatally infirm and that we should now direct that it be reopened.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> He further argues, as he must, that the plea does not stand in the way of the appeal brought here for that purpose. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1261-9\">A plea of guilty consummating a voluntary and intelligent choice of available alternatives<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> has serious ramifications for the criminal proceeding. It operates as an admission of all material facts alleged in the count or counts pleaded to,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and thus dispenses with the need to prove them.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> More important, however, is the effect of the plea beyond this service for the Government. \u201c[T]he plea is more than an admission of past conduct; it is the defendant\u2019s consent that judgment of conviction may be entered without a trial \u2014 a waiver of his right to trial before a jury or a judge.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> It is thus an act bringing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1194\">*1194</page-number>the prosecution to a successful end by solemnly establishing the offense so acknowledged :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1262-4\">A plea of guilty differs in purpose and effect from a mere admission or an extra-judicial confession; it is itself a conviction. Like a verdict of a jury it is conclusive. More is not required; the court has nothing to do but give judgment and sentence.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"AklN\"> We speak, of course, only of a valid plea of guilty, which by definition is one which is understandably as well as voluntarily made.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The plea cannot take on that character unless, among other things, the accused is aware of the consequences,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> of which its conclusivity on the proceeding is not the least. But if, on the other hand, the accused possesses that awareness and nonetheless enters the plea, it is truly an \u201cintentional relinquishment or abandonment\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> of defenses and procedural entitlements of which the defendant otherwise might have availed himself.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1262-22\">So it is that \u201c[a]n unqualified plea of guilty, legitimately obtained and still in force, bars further consideration of all but the most fundamental premises for the conviction.\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Emerging from the numerous decisions on the subject is the well settled rule that an unconditional plea of guilty waives all prior infirmities in the prosecution which affect neither the court\u2019s jurisdiction nor the substantive sufficiency of the indictment.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> The decisions make equally plain the corollary that as long as the plea stands, it bans consideration of other types of defects on appeal.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1195\">*1195</page-number>We are unable to distinguish, in terms of the bar, a direct appeal in the criminal proceeding from an appeal in collateral litigation designed, as here, to secure benefits at a criminal trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1263-4\">As we have said, the key to waiver, and to conclusivity of the plea on further litigation, combines the accused\u2019s understanding that that would become a consequence of pleading guilty and his willingness to so plead on those term.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> The plea is invalid, of course, if the accused did not realize that it would sacrifice his right to judicial determination of the factual and legal issues by a trial with ultimate appellate review.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> And surely an accused is not barred from pursuing his appeal by pleading guilty where a statute authorizes him to do both.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> But there is an inherent conflict in the notion that, absent such a statute \u2014 the case in the federal system \u2014an accused can intelligently waive adverse pre-plea rulings with a view to reposing the litigation and still keep the issues alive on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1263-5\">We are mindful of the suggestion that the ends of sound judicial administration might be better served by permitting the accused to preserve adverse rulings on legal questions for appeal without the burden of a potentially futile trial on the merits.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> That position was asserted in United States v. Doyle,<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> but the court answered:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1263-14\">The premise is sound enough but the conclusion does not follow. There are a number of ways to deal sensibly with such a case without departing from the [conclusivity rule]. A plea expressly reserving the point accepted by the court with the Government\u2019s consent or a stipulation that the facts are as charged in the indictment are two; failing either of these, the defendant can simply stand on his not guilty plea and put the Government to its proof without developing a case of his own.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1263-15\">We agree, and believe too that without a choice between the competing values by an exercise of statutory or rule-making powers,<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> the availability of appeal must depend on the breadth of the accused\u2019s waiver.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1263-16\">That Coleman\u2019s waiver was broad enough to encompass his present appeal is a matter not fairly open to doubt on the record. Unlike the two counts to which he pleaded guilty, other counts of the indictments against him charged crimes for which there were mandatory penalties,<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> which anyone would naturally wish to avoid. The Government was willing to accept Coleman\u2019s plea on the two counts carrying lighter penalties, but only if the plea were tendered right away. The Govern-. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1196\">*1196</page-number>ment made it plain that it would not hold its offer of acceptance open just to enable Coleman to litigate this appeal. This was fully appreciated by defense counsel, who protested the Government\u2019s position to the District Judge, and by Coleman himself, who acknowledged to the judge his understanding that the plea would foreclose both trial and appeal.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> We conclude that Coleman\u2019s outstanding plea of guilty has precisely that effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b1264-4\">The plea, we are also persuaded, was unaffected by Coleman\u2019s simultaneous protestation of innocence.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> While pleas of guilty are usually accompanied by express admissions of guilt,<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> lack of that element in no wis\u00e9 conditions the plea.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> In North Carolina v. Alford,<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> the Supreme Court held flatly that \u201c[a]n individual accused of crime may voluntarily, knowingly' and understandably consent to the imposition of a prison sentence even if he is unwilling or unable to admit his participation in the acts constituting the crime.\u201d<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> Long prior to the decision in <em>Alford, </em>penalties imposed on defendants who maintained even vigorously that they did not commit the charged offenses, but who nonetheless entered pleas of nolo contendere, were upheld against constitutional attacks upon them.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> In <em>Alford, </em>the Court perceived no difference between a guilty plea refusing to avow the commission of the offense and one simultaneously maintaining the accused\u2019s innocence.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> As long as each is voluntarily and intelligently entered, there is no cause for constitutional complaint.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1264-15\">Similarly, the Government\u2019s refusal to extend its acceptance of the plea for the period Coleman continued in this litigation did not vitiate the plea.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> The Government\u2019s declination stemmed from its concern that its case against Coleman might deteriorate in the meantime, and it is not for us to substitute our judgment for its. Nor is this a \u201csituation [in which] the prosecutor or judge, or both, deliberately employ their charging and sentencing powers to induce a particular defendant to tender a plea of guilty.\u201d <footnotemark>41</footnotemark> On the contrary, the record supports amply the conclusion that Coleman made his plea voluntarily, and knowingly at the expense of the appeal. We hold that his attack on his preliminary hearing is now barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b1264-16\">II. SHEPARD\u2019S APPEAL</p>\n<p id=\"b1264-17\">Appellant Shepard was charged with assaulting a Deputy United States Marshal<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> while a prisoner in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1197\">*1197</page-number>cellblock<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> of the District of Columbia Court of General Sessions.<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> A judge of that court, sitting as a committing magistrate,<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> presided over his preliminary hearing. The complaining witness, Deputy Marshal John H. Lonien, testified that while he was on duty in the cellblock, Shepard committed an unprovoked attack upon him, striking him above the right eye with a fist. Another Government witness, Herbert Rutherford, employed as a guard in the cell-block, corroborated Marshal Lonien\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b1265-4\">Shepard\u2019s counsel was permitted considerable latitude in cross-examination of these witnesses as to matters they had testified to on direct examination. The judge, however, sustained the Government\u2019s objections to a number of inquiries directed to them on other topics. The specific complaint Shepard refers to us runs to the judge\u2019s rulings on eleven questions propounded to Marshal Lonien and four to Guard Rutherford.<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> Those questions, in the main, solicited testimony as to disparaging remarks assertedly directed to cellblock personnel by prisoners other than Shepard, and to the nature and extent of any injuries inflicted by Shepard on Marshal Lonien and of injuries allegedly sustained by Shepard himself.<footnotemark>47</footnotemark> The judge also ruled out Shepard\u2019s proffer of photographs purporting to show his post-altercation physical condition, and inquiry of a defense witness as to whether cellblock personnel had tried to confiscate the photographs.</p>\n<p id=\"b1265-7\">The more common basis of the Government\u2019s objections to defense counsel\u2019s cross-examinatorial approach was that he was venturing beyond the boundaries of a hearing designed to explore probable cause and embarking on a quest for discovery of elements of the Government\u2019s case.<footnotemark>48</footnotemark> After some amount of prior ambivalence on the subject, Shep<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1198\">*1198</page-number>ard now disclaims any attempt at discovery, as distinguished from refutation of probable cause.<footnotemark>49</footnotemark> - He further argues that the questions addressed to Marshal Lonien and Guard Rutherford bore a substantial relationship to the existence or nonexistence of probable cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b1266-4\">At the outset, we put aside an otherwise litigable circumstance which has come to our attention. Exercising our power to judicially notice proceedings in related cases,<footnotemark>50</footnotemark> we learned that, after oral argument and submission in this court, Shepard entered a plea of guilty to a lesser offense included within the charge on which he was indicted. Unlike their stance with respect to Coleman, appellees have not contended that Shepard\u2019s plea affects his appeal, nor indeed did either side see fit to even make us aware of the plea. We have pointed out that a plea of guilty operates as a barrier only when it possesses the elements of a valid waiver of further litigation.<footnotemark>51</footnotemark> In Coleman\u2019s instance, the record satisfies us that his plea did,<footnotemark>52</footnotemark> but in Shepard\u2019s we have no record on the matter at all.<footnotemark>53</footnotemark> Accordingly, we do not consider this potential problem.</p>\n<p id=\"b1266-14\">A. <em>Discovery at Preliminary Hearings</em></p>\n<p id=\"AyY\">Former Rule 5(c) granted the accused, and its present counterpart continues to confer, the right to \u201ccross-examine witnesses against him\u201d at a preliminary hearing.<footnotemark>54</footnotemark> The true dimension of that right is bound to depend in considerable measure upon the degree to which discovery by the defense may be a purpose the preliminary hearing is designed to serve. That,\u2019 in turn, is a topic upon which the judges of this court have expressed views which, to say the least, have not been entirely harmonious.<footnotemark>55</footnotemark> One view has been that the sole objective of a preliminary hear<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1199\">*1199</page-number>ing is to determine whether there is probable cause to believe that the accused has committed an offense, and that the accused may lay claim to the benefit of only so much discovery as may become incidental to a properly conducted inquiry into probable cause.<footnotemark>56</footnotemark> That view has now been incorporated into federal jurisprudence by the Federal Magistrates Act.<footnotemark>57</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1267-5\">This Act provides mandatorily, with exceptions later to be considered,<footnotemark>58</footnotemark> for \u201ca preliminary [hearing] ... to determine whether there is probable cause to believe that an offense has been committed and that the arrested person has committed it.\u201d<footnotemark>59</footnotemark> The reason the Act indulges the preliminary hearing no independent discovery role is evident from its legislative history. During hearings before the Senate Committee on the Judiciary, witnesses urged \u201cthat preliminary examination afforded a necessary and useful medium for defense counsel to obtain discovery of the prosecution\u2019s evidence.\u201d<footnotemark>60</footnotemark> The Committee, however, was \u201cof the opinion that the problem of discovery should be treated separately from that of the preliminary hearing.\u201d <footnotemark>61</footnotemark> Although the need for expanded pretrial discovery procedures was recognized,<footnotemark>62</footnotemark> the Committee felt that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1267-7\">The preliminary hearing does not present an ideal opportunity for discovery. It is designed for another purpose; namely, that of determining whether there is probable cause to justify further proceedings against an arrested person. Thus, the degree of discovery obtained in a preliminary hearing will vary depending upon how much evidence the presiding judicial officer thinks is necessary to establish probable cause in a particular case. This may be quite a bit, or it may be very little, but in either event it need not be all the evidence within the possession of the Government that should be subject to discovery.<footnotemark>63</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"AUj\">The Committee accordingly concluded<footnotemark>64</footnotemark> \u201cthat discovery procedure should remain separate and distinct from the preliminary examination. . . . \u201d<footnotemark>65</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1267-8\">That settles the matter, of course, for Shepard and others whose hearings took place after the effective date of the Act.<footnotemark>66</footnotemark> The mission of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1200\">*1200</page-number>hearing is an investigation into probable cause for further proceedings against the accused. It does not include discovery for the sake of discovery. To be sure, the evidence the Government offers to establish probable cause is by nature also discovery for the accused. So also is information adduced on cross-examination of Government witnesses on the aspects of direct-examination testimony tending to build up probable cause. In those senses, some discovery becomes a by-product of the process of demonstrating probable cause. But in no sense is discovery a legitimate end unto itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b1268-4\">B. <em>Cross-Examination at Preliminary Hearings</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1268-5\">To say merely that discovery is not a primary function of federal preliminary hearings is to respond only incompletely to the issue Shepard poses. As we have said, former Rule 5(e) conferred upon the accused the right to \u201ccross-examine witnesses against him,\u201d <footnotemark>67</footnotemark> and that right he continues to enjoy.<footnotemark>68</footnotemark> Moreover, in Coleman v. Alabama,<footnotemark>69</footnotemark> the Supreme Court, in holding that a preliminary hearing to ascertain probable cause to bind an accused for additional proceedings is a critical stage of the criminal process at which the Sixth Amendment right to counsel obtains,<footnotemark>70</footnotemark> pointed out as one of the considerations supporting its holding that \u201cthe lawyer\u2019s skilled examination and cross-examination of witnesses may expose fatal weaknesses in the [prosecution\u2019s] case that may lead the magistrate to refuse to bind the accused over.\u201d<footnotemark>71</footnotemark> Since the right to counsel is the right to effective assistance of counsel,<footnotemark>72</footnotemark> <em>Coleman </em>requires us to evaluate Shepard\u2019s challenge with the increased solicitude appropriate when constitutional rights are at stake.<footnotemark>73</footnotemark> This we have done, and we are led to the conclusion that the District Court\u2019s disposition of Shepard\u2019s grievance should not be disturbed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1268-14\">According to Shepard\u2019s brief on appeal, the purpose of his counsel\u2019s questions on cross-examination of the two Government witnesses was to show that \u201c(a) there were no physical injuries to the Marshals; (b) there were severe injuries to Mr. Shepard rendering him unconscious; (c) the assault charge was brought as a subterfuge for the Marshals\u2019 own conduct; (d) the Marshals were provoked by disparaging <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1201\">*1201</page-number>remarks by prisoners other than Mr. Shepard; (e) there was mass confusion in the cellblock seriously impeding the perception of the Marshals; and (f) there was evidence that Mr. Shepard acted in self-defense, if he acted at all.\u201d <footnotemark>74</footnotemark> The first difficulty we have encountered is that the handling of the cross-examination made this understanding all too difficult to come by. Cross-examination at a preliminary hearing, like the hearing itself, is confined by the principle that a probe into probable cause is the end and aim of the proceeding,<footnotemark>75</footnotemark> and the line between refutation of probable cause and discovery into the prosecution\u2019s case ofttimes is thin. Here counsel\u2019s purpose in pro pounding the questions which the presiding judge excluded was unquestionably blurred by the fact that counsel frequently appeared to be off on an impermissible quest for discovery. At no time prior to the rulings complained of did counsel delineate for the judge\u2019s edification the factual thesis he was seeking to promote. Only as the hearing neared its close, and after the rulings had been made, did counsel broach anything remotely similar to the defensive theory now explained on appeal.<footnotemark>76</footnotemark> Our reading of the hearing record leaves us with the conviction that the presiding judge, when ruling on counsel\u2019s questions, could hardly divine what counsel had in mind. Therefore, we cannot say that he committed error in barring responses to inquiries that seemed unrelated to the task of evaluating probable cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b1269-5\">Moreover, cross-examination is properly to be limited at preliminary hearing, as at trial, to the scope of the witness\u2019 direct examination. To the extent that it is not \u2014 and here it was not \u2014cross-examination ostensibly, even if undesignedly, becomes an effort at some sort of discovery. We do not suggest that magistrates may not indulge variations from the usual order of offering evidence, and during presentation of the Government\u2019s case permit the defense to get in elements of its own. But when cross-examination exceeds the range of direct examination unaccompanied by an elucidation of its connection with probable cause, it is small wonder that discovery is taken to be the examiner\u2019s goal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1269-11\">An even more important consideration stems from the difference between the objective of the preliminary hearing and that of the trial. While, of course, conviction necessitates proof at trial of all elements of a crime beyond a reasonable doubt, it suffices for purposes of a binding over for trial that the evidence show \u201cprobable cause to believe that an offense has been committed and that the defendant has committed it.\u201d <footnotemark>77</footnotemark> The preliminary hearing is not a mini-trial of the issue of guilt, but is rather an investigation into the reasonableness of the bases for the charge, and examination of witnesses thereat does not enjoy the breadth it commands at trial.<footnotemark>78</footnotemark> \u201cA preliminary hearing,\u201d the Supreme Court has said, \u201cis ordinarily a much less searching exploration into the merits of a case than a trial, simply because its function is the more limited one of determining whether probable cause exists to hold the accused for trial.\u201d <footnotemark>79</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"An_\"> It is the contrast of probable cause and proof beyond a reasonable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1202\">*1202</page-number>doubt that inevitably makes for examinatorial differences between the preliminary hearing and the trial. Probable cause signifies evidence sufficient to cause a person of ordinary prudence and caution to conscientiously entertain a reasonable belief of the accused\u2019s guilt.<footnotemark>80</footnotemark> Proof beyond a reasonable doubt, on the other hand, connotes evidence strong enough to create an abiding conviction of guilt to a moral certainty.<footnotemark>81</footnotemark> The gap between these two concepts is broad. A magistrate may become satisfied about probable cause on much less than he would need to be convinced. Since he does not sit to pass on guilt or innocence, he could legitimately find probable cause while personally entertaining some reservations. By the same token, a showing of probable cause may stop considerably short of proof beyond a reasonable doubt, and evidence that leaves some doubt may yet demonstrate probable cause. In the instance before us, the testimony of two witnesses on direct examination furnished more than an ample foundation for a finding of probable cause which the cross-examination allowed did not impair. By our appraisal the convoluted defensive theory Shepard now says he wanted to develop <footnotemark>82</footnotemark> was not likely to change the result. Whatever its potency as a basis for a reasonable doubt at trial, its capability to dissolve enough of the Government\u2019s showing to negate probable cause strikes us as highly improbable. We speak not only of the cross-examination which was banned but also of the items of similar purport which on Shepard\u2019s presentation were excluded.<footnotemark>83</footnotemark> In any event, the situation is far too cloudy to warrant a grant of the extraordinary relief which Shepard seeks.</p>\n<p id=\"b1270-12\">Magistrates presiding over preliminary hearings, no less than judges presiding over trials, are endowed with broad powers to supervise examination of witnesses.<footnotemark>84</footnotemark> Beyond that, they should be indulged some leeway in their resolution of probable cause issues. Courts should not upset these judgmatic exercises unless a supervisory excess or a decisional error is clearly shown,<footnotemark>85</footnotemark> and we do not perceive either here. Shepard\u2019s counsel was permitted to cross-examine each Government witness closely as to the elements of his direct testimony and, for the reasons stated, we cannot say that disallowance of the questions ruled out was improper. For similar reasons, we are unable to say that the photographs and the questions as to the defense witness possessed such a tendency to dissolve probable cause that their exclusion was erroneous. A writ of mandamus lies only to enforce a plain, positive duty; it is not available to exact a response to a dubious claim.<footnotemark>86</footnotemark> At best, any obligation to reverse the rulings on the excluded evidence is entirely too unclear. We accordingly affirm as to Shepard.</p>\n<p id=\"b1270-13\">III. DANCIS\u2019 APPEAL</p>\n<p id=\"b1270-14\">Dancis, our third appellant, was charged with two violations of the Marijuana Tax Act.<footnotemark>87</footnotemark> The charges came on for ventilation at a preliminary hearing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1203\">*1203</page-number>over which a United States Magistrate presided. The magistrate denied his counsel\u2019s request for a subpoena requiring the attendance of an unnamed undercover agent, who apparently was the sole available eyewitness to the two marijuana transactions attributed to Daneis. The Government\u2019s only witness at the hearing was the agent\u2019s supervisor, whose testimony as to the alleged transactions was necessarily hearsay, and as to the transactor\u2019s identity was simply that the agent had identified Daneis from a six-year old photograph. The magistrate, on a finding of probable cause, held Daneis for grand jury action, and the District Court, in the case under review, held that the hearing was legally sufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b1271-14\"> Daneis argues that each of two flaws vitiated his preliminary hearing. One is that the magistrate\u2019s refusal to allow him access to the undercover agent\u2019s testimony was prejudicial error. The other is that the Confrontation Clause <footnotemark>88</footnotemark> outlaws the magistrate\u2019s finding of probable cause solely upon the hearsay testimony of the agent\u2019s supervisor.<footnotemark>89</footnotemark> We deem it unnecessary to reach the constitutional issue posed by Daneis\u2019 second contention<footnotemark>90</footnotemark> because we agree that he is on sound ground in advancing the first.<footnotemark>91</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1271-15\">A. <em>Defensive Evidence at Preliminary Hearings</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1271-16\">Former Rule 5(c) confirmed the right of an accused to \u201cintroduce ev<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1204\">*1204</page-number>idence in his own behalf\u201d at his preliminary hearing.<footnotemark>92</footnotemark> It also imposed the requirement that an affirmative decision on probable cause be reached \u201con the evidence.\u201d<footnotemark>93</footnotemark> The specifications of present Rule 5.1(a) are identical.<footnotemark>94</footnotemark> Thus a federal preliminary hearing is not only the occasion upon which the Government must justify continued detention by a showing of probable cause, but also an opportunity for the accused to rebut that showing.<footnotemark>95</footnotemark> Rule 5(c) made it clear that it is as much the arrestee\u2019s prerogative to endeavor to minimize probable cause as it is the Government\u2019s to undertake to maximize it, and that both sides must be indulged reasonably in their respective efforts. And the Government\u2019s demonstration on probable cause must surmount not only difficulties of its own but also any attack the accused may be able to mount against it.<footnotemark>96</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1272-4\">In sum, \u201cthe evidence\u201d which alone must guide resolution of the probable cause issue is the whole evidence\u2014 for the defense as well as for the prosecution. The magistrate must \u201clisten to [the] versions [of all witnesses] and observe their demeanor and provide an opportunity to defense counsel to explore their account on cross-examination.\u201d <footnotemark>97</footnotemark> The magistrate \u201csits as a judicial officer to sift all the evidence before resolving the probable cause issue. . . . \u201d<footnotemark>98</footnotemark> He \u201ccannot decline to issue subpoenas on the ground that only the Government\u2019s evidence is probative.\u201d<footnotemark>99</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1272-12\">These provisions of the Rules and our interpretations of them are now reinforced by the holding in Coleman v. Alabama<footnotemark>100</footnotemark> that the Sixth Amendment secures for the accused the assistance of counsel at a preliminary hearing having for its purpose a determination on probable cause to hold him for further proceedings.<footnotemark>101</footnotemark> Among counsel\u2019s potential contributions, the Court stated, is \u201cskilled examination . of witnesses [which] may expose fatal weaknesses in the [prosecution\u2019s] case that may lead the magistrate to refuse to bind the accused over.\u201d <footnotemark>102</footnotemark> It cannot be gainsaid that what the Sixth Amendment mandated for Alabama\u2019s preliminary hearing it exacts equally for the federal preliminary hearing which, we repeat, is exclusively an exploration into probable cause to hold the accused to answer the prosecution further.<footnotemark>103</footnotemark> Nor can it be doubted that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1205\">*1205</page-number><em>Coleman </em>demands more than the mere presence of counsel at the hearing. The right to counsel which <em>Coleman </em>declared would amount to no more than a pious overture unless it is a right to counsel able to function efficaciously in his client\u2019s behalf. The Sixth Amendment\u2019s guaranty of counsel is a pledge of effective assistance by counsel,<footnotemark>104</footnotemark> and <em>Coleman </em>makes it clear that federal preliminary hearings, as critical stages of criminal prosecutions, require no less. If the accused\u2019s counsel is reduced to a state of impotence in the discharge of this responsibility, it is evident that the accused is deprived of the very benefit which the Sixth Amendment\u2019s boon of counsel was designed to confer.<footnotemark>105</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1273-5\">So, an accused is normally entitled to subpoenas compelling the attendance at his preliminary hearing of witnesses whose testimony promises appreciable assistance on the issue of probable cause.<footnotemark>106</footnotemark> The test, our past utterances on the subject have indicated, couples the witness\u2019 materiality<footnotemark>107</footnotemark> with an absence of good cause for not requiring his presence,<footnotemark>108</footnotemark> and its operation does not depend upon which side might have been expected to call the witness.<footnotemark>109</footnotemark> Certainly an accused will not in every instance qualify for a subpoena for the production of a Government witness at his preliminary hearing, but where he succeeds in a plausible showing that that witness could contribute significantly to the accuracy of the probable cause determination, the request for the subpoena should be granted. \u201cThis,\u201d we have said, \u201cis consistent with the principal purpose of the preliminary hearing as a mechanism to determine whether the evidence is adequate to establish probable cause.\u201d <footnotemark>110</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1273-7\">We think the testimony of the undercover agent Dancis desired at his preliminary hearing met the standard of materiality. From aught that appears, he was the only available person who could testify to the two charged marijuana transfers from personal observation, and by the same token the only one who could directly identify the party responsible for them. Since probable cause to bind Dancis over for further prosecution depended on the caliber of the Government\u2019s showing that he was that party and that what he did on the two occasions under scrutiny was illegal, it seems clear that the witness he requested could have given testimony bearing critically upon those matters. In Washington v. Clemmer<footnotemark>111</footnotemark> it was the complainant in a rape case who was sought, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1206\">*1206</page-number>and in Ross v. Sirica <footnotemark>112</footnotemark> the only three eyewitnesses to a murder. In both cases we held that denial of the accused\u2019s access to them was error,<footnotemark>113</footnotemark> and it appears to us that the sole eyewitness to the transgressions laid to Dancis was equally material.</p>\n<p id=\"b1274-4\">As we admonished in <em>Ross, </em>\u201c[w]hatever the full reach of the accused\u2019s subpoena rights at a preliminary hearing, . . . he is entitled to compel the attendance of eyewitnesses unless, of course, 'because of physical or psychological disability in a particular case\u2019 such witnesses cannot attend.\u201d<footnotemark>114</footnotemark> That seems the more so when the nature of the Government\u2019s presentation at Dancis\u2019 preliminary hearing is taken fully into account. The Government offered but one witness, and he could testify on the vital issues of offenses and identity only from hearsay, and it is evident that that weakened the showing. To the extent that hearsay is employed, the effort to establish probable cause becomes more prone to attack since the reliability of the absent hearsay declarant always becomes an added factor to be reckoned with. In <em>Ross, </em>where, similarly to Dancis\u2019 case the Government\u2019s one witness at a preliminary hearing on a murder charge was a police officer who could merely relay what three eyewitnesses had told him about the crime, two judges of this court aptly observed, without dispute from the rest, that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1274-6\">A judicial officer engaged in a judicial determination of probable cause can hardly rest easy solely with the hearsay account of the policeman of what these eyewitnesses told him if the eyewitnesses can be available, so that he can listen to their versions and observe their demeanor, and provide an opportunity to defense counsel to explore their account on cross-examination. The presence of those witnesses impresses us as falling within the orbit of the rights conferred upon the accused by the fourth sentence of Rule 5(c). . . . <footnotemark>115</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1274-12\">Indeed, the problem addressed in <em>Ross </em>is compounded in the situation before us now. The Government\u2019s evidence at Dancis\u2019 preliminary hearing was not only hearsay but also hearsay without any apparent means of refutation whatever. The undercover agent was not only absent from the hearing but at the time was also totally unidentified. He did not sign the complaint against Dancis, nor was he named in it, and the testimony at the hearing referred to him simply by his code name \u201cJohn P.\u201d Defense counsel\u2019s inquiries on cross-examination as to his real name, and even as to generic characteristics,<footnotemark>116</footnotemark> drew objections from the Government which the magistrate sustained. There was little or nothing in the Government\u2019s .presentation to lend credit to the reliability of either the agent or the observations purportedly incriminating and identifying Dancis. It is difficult to imagine a case wherein the accused was more helpless to defend against a hearsay attribution of probable cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b1274-14\">To say, as we do, that the testimony of the absent witness was material does not mean necessarily that the refusal of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1207\">*1207</page-number>the subpoena was error vitiating the preliminary hearing. A refusal may be justified, and if it is a finding of probable cause climaxing the hearing must stand.<footnotemark>117</footnotemark> The record before us, however, is singularly devoid of any such justification. There is no hint that the undercover officer was physically unamenable to a subpoena or in any way disabled from responding to it.<footnotemark>118</footnotemark> There is no suggestion that his information about the episodes under exploration was to any extent privileged from compulsory disclosure.<footnotemark>119</footnotemark> Nor is there a basis for attributing the denial of the subpoena to the exigencies of any undercover operation.<footnotemark>120</footnotemark> The magistrate did not predicate the denial upon any of these grounds, nor did the Government even urge any of them. And to the extent that the record may furnish indications that the magistrate was satisfied on probable cause without hearing from the undercover agent,<footnotemark>121</footnotemark> it suffices to repeat that the issue thereon cannot properly be resolved without accommodating reasonable demands of the prosecution and the defense for the production of evidence capable of shaping the outcome.<footnotemark>122</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1275-14\">B. <em>Return of Indictment</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1275-15\">Concluding as we do that the magistrate erred in refusing Daneis the benefit of the undercover officer\u2019s testimony, we are left to determine how the mistake should be corrected. The first question confronting that effort is whether the indictment returned against Daneis forecloses rectification of the error. It is well settled that an indictment itself establishes sufficient proba-' ble cause for holding the accused for trial,<footnotemark>123</footnotemark> and that explains why we have consistently held that he is not entitled to a preliminary hearing where he is indicted before a hearing is held. Typical situations are those wherein the accused is indicted prior to arrest on the charges,<footnotemark>124</footnotemark> or prior to the date set for preliminary hearing on the charges,<footnotemark>125</footnotemark> or where he is in custody on another charge when indicted.<footnotemark>126</footnotemark> In none of these instances can a preliminary hearing serve a need to probe probable cause to detain the accused, for the indictment has fulfilled that need.<footnotemark>127</footnotemark> Nor can the hearing be invoked merely as a device for obtaining discovery, for discovery independent of the ascertainment of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1208\">*1208</page-number>probable cause is not one of its functions.<footnotemark>128</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1276-4\">The case before us, however, is markedly different. Dancis was given a preliminary hearing on the pending charges prior to return of the indictment. At that hearing, by his allegation, he was denied the right then conferred by former Rule 5(c) to examine a witness in his own behalf. That contention, we think, keeps Dancis in court despite the post-hearing rendition of the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1276-5\">Where in terms of the requirements of the Rules, a preliminary hearing is defective, the accused is obviously entitled to a reopening of the hearing to enable remediation of the defect if that can be done before a grand jury acts in the matter. \u201cTo say that the preliminary hearing[] [was] defective is to say that the determination of probable cause was inadequate and should not operate to deprive the accused of his liberty pending grand jury consideration.\u201d<footnotemark>129</footnotemark> Accordingly, we have not hesitated to direct a supplemental preliminary hearing on demonstration that at the original hearing the accused did not get his just due.<footnotemark>130</footnotemark> That remedy,' of course, is additional to the accused\u2019s prerogative to seek a dissolution of the commitment itself.<footnotemark>131</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1276-6\">We have, moreover, adhered to the view that such a deprivation can be remedied by a reopening of the hearing even after return of an indictment. The indictment bars relitigation of the question of probable cause, of course, but the fact remains that save for disrespect of the accused\u2019s rights he would have enlarged his insight into the Government\u2019s case against him \u2014 as a by-product of efforts pro and con on probable cause in the course of the Government\u2019s submission. Since, however, a Rule 5(c) right was dishonored, the accused lost a part of that by-product, and we have held that the hearing should be reopened to afford the accused an opportunity to retrieve the part which has been lost.<footnotemark>132</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1276-17\">That is the rationale of our past decisions respecting post-indictment supplemental preliminary hearings. The supplemental hearing was not an occasion for a reexamination of probable cause, for the indictment had settled that issue. Nor was its purpose discovery for its own sake, but only such discovery as would inexorably have accompanied scrupulous observance of the Rule 5(c) right. Reopening of the preliminary hearing, then, emerged as both an appropriate sanction for and remediation of Rule 5(e) violations, not unlike, though less drastic than, the more familiar sanction of former Rule 5(a) which the Supreme Court\u2019s <em>Mallory </em>decision supplied.<footnotemark>133</footnotemark> The effect of the supplemental hearing was to confer upon the accused the benefit of only so much incidental discovery as would have been his but for the infringement of Rule 5(c).<footnotemark>134</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1276-18\">Since our development of this prophylactic doctrine, however, the Federal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1209\">*1209</page-number>Magistrates Act<footnotemark>135</footnotemark> was adopted, and the question becomes whether the Act has set the doctrine for naught. The Act lays down the broad mandate that an arrestee be offered a preliminary hearing,<footnotemark>136</footnotemark> the date for which must be fixed at his initial appearance before a judge or magistrate after his arrest.<footnotemark>137</footnotemark> The hearing must be conducted \u201cwithin a reasonable time following initial appearance, but in any event not later than\u201d ten days where the arrestee remains in custody<footnotemark>138</footnotemark> or twenty days where he is enlarged in the interim.<footnotemark>139</footnotemark> The Act specifies, however, in Section 303(e) that \u201c[n]o preliminary examination . . . shall be required to be accorded an arrested person if at any time subsequent to the initial appearance of such person before a judge or magistrate and prior to the date fixed for the preliminary examination ... an indictment is returned. ...\u201d<footnotemark>140</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1277-6\">We need not ponder whether the Act erects a barrier to a post-indictment pretrial reopening of a preliminary hearing which is seriously defective under the criteria specified in the Rules. To be sure, the remedy we provided in Ross v. Sirica,<footnotemark>141</footnotemark> in circumstances comparable to those here, was a remand to the magistrate for a supplemental hearing.<footnotemark>142</footnotemark> But <em>Ross, </em>like other decisions in its day, rested on the theory that discovery was as much a function of the preliminary hearing as an investigation into probable cause to bind the accused for further prosecution.<footnotemark>143</footnotemark> The Act was passed after <em>Ross </em>was decided, and whether or not it imposed an absolute ban on reopenings of preliminary hearings, it certainly destroyed discovery as a reason for ordering a reopening.<footnotemark>144</footnotemark> Furthermore, nothing in <em>Ross </em>nor in any of our other holdings inexorably required a supplemental hearing when another procedure might do equal or superior service. On the contrary, it was our uniform practice to relegate the problem of remediation, not to the magistrate, but to the trial judge when the deficiency in the preliminary hearing first came to light after the accused had been convicted.<footnotemark>145</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1277-8\">Even more importantly, <em>Ross </em>predated not only the Act but also the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Coleman v. Alabama,<footnotemark>146</footnotemark> and <em>Coleman </em>introduced an element of the remedy problem which this court has not hitherto had- occasion to consider. To put in a nutshell what we later elucidate, <em>Coleman </em>identifies the constitutional right to effective assistance of counsel as an incident of preliminary hearings and assures yindiea<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1210\">*1210</page-number>tion of that right.<footnotemark>147</footnotemark> It is evident, then, that the return of an indictment against the accused cannot eliminate the need for procedures of some kind to redress violations of the <em>Coleman </em>right.<footnotemark>148</footnotemark> On the other hand, the <em>Coleman-type </em>remedy, when invoked prior to trial, embraces an array of alternatives for dissipating potential prejudice.<footnotemark>149</footnotemark> So, even if a reopening of the hearing survives the Act as one of these alternatives, Dancis cannot compel that particular choice.</p>\n<p id=\"b1278-4\">Mandamus is an extraordinary remedy,<footnotemark>150</footnotemark> available only to enforce a clear, unequivocal duty.<footnotemark>151</footnotemark> It does not lie to control an exercise of judgment.<footnotemark>152</footnotemark> Dancis, we say, is entitled, notwithstanding the indictment, to protection against injury resulting from the magistrate\u2019s mistake.<footnotemark>153</footnotemark> But Dancis is not necessarily entitled to receive that protection through a supplemental hearing before the magistrate, assuming even that the Act leaves that course open as a possibility. Additionally, as we later discuss, a supplemental hearing suffers by comparison with other alternatives open in this case.<footnotemark>154</footnotemark> It is unnecessary, then, for us to decide whether in any event such a hearing would be available after an indictment has issued, and that decision we pretermit to another day.</p>\n<p id=\"AWB\">C. <em>The Remedy</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1278-16\">Coleman v. Alabama<footnotemark>155</footnotemark> bestowed upon Dancis an inviolable right to protection against harmful consequences flowing from the magistrate\u2019s refusal to permit examination of the undercover agent at the preliminary hearing.<footnotemark>156</footnotemark> <em>Coleman </em>also offers guidance as to the proper course to be taken where, following trial and conviction, the accused seeks to remedy a constitutional deficiency in his preliminary hearing. In <em>Coleman, </em>the Court could not determine from the record whether the absence of counsel from the accused\u2019s preliminary hearing actually worked prejudice at his trial, so it vacated the conviction and remanded the case to the Alabama courts for an inquiry on that score.<footnotemark>157</footnotemark> In the event that prejudice was found, the remedy would be a new trial; but if, applying the test set out in Chapman v. California,<footnotemark>158</footnotemark> it was found that the in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1211\">*1211</page-number>firmity in the preliminary hearing was harmless, the conviction would be reinstated.<footnotemark>159</footnotemark> Even prior to <em>Coleman, </em>as we have said, in our own post-conviction decisions we have settled upon the same remedial course where serious flaws in preliminary hearings left them infirm.<footnotemark>160</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1279-5\">These decisions chart the route to be traveled when the error is judicially detected only after conviction. But that is not Dancis\u2019 situation, for while he has been indicted he has not yet been tried. Dancis could, of course, proceed to trial secure in the knowledge that should he encounter prejudice because of the refusal of the subpoena requested at his preliminary hearing, any conviction would have to be set for naught. But it would be senseless to require him to undergo trial and conviction before undertaking to repair the defect. On the contrary, we have emphasized that one deprived of his just due at a preliminary hearing not only may, but ordinarily must, seek rectification in court immediately.<footnotemark>161</footnotemark> This position may reflect the undesirability of permitting an accused to withhold his complaint until after he has lost a gamble on the jury\u2019s verdict. In any event, it certainly reflects a decided preference to avert prejudice before it occurs rather than to wait and deal with it after the fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b1279-6\">We think, too, that the problem of remediation arising pretrial, no less than when it emerges after conviction, is one to be addressed by the court itself. There is nothing to be gained, over and above handling by the judge, by sending the case back to the magistrate for a supplemental preliminary hearing after the accused has been indicted. The magistrate cannot reinvestigate probable cause, for the indictment establishes its existence, nor is there anything else that officer can do that the judge cannot do better. The concern is that the accused may suffer prejudice at his forthcoming trial by the infringement of his rights at the hearing, and avoidance of prejudice is the function and duty of the judge himself. Obviously the judge could not, by directing the magistrate to reopen the preliminary hearing, shift his own responsibility to the magistrate. In our view, where an unmitigated blunder at a preliminary hearing may infect the ensuing trial, the court is obligated to scrutinize the accused\u2019s claim of possible injury, and to take appropriate corrective action.</p>\n<p id=\"b1279-8\">We perceive no reason why, in the circumstances presented, the problem at hand cannot be fully accommodated within the framework of' the criminal prosecution pending against Dancis. The judge who is to preside at Dancis\u2019 trial is amply equipped to dissipate whatever risk of prejudice was bred by Dancis\u2019 inability to call the undercover officer as a witness at his preliminary hearing. There are opportunities uniquely open to the trial judge, particularly with the cooperation of the parties, to seek remediation of the magistrate\u2019s error before any real damage is done, and the judge is free to draw upon his imagination in the kind of remedy-fashioning which traditionally has been a prerogative of the federal judiciary. Moreover, it would be advantageous to the prosecution and the accused alike to eliminate the problem from the realm of future litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1279-9\">The indictment against Dancis named the undercover agent, and it may well be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1212\">*1212</page-number>that he testified before the grand jury. If so, the trial judge might consider making the agent\u2019s grand jury testimony available to defense counsel. Alternatively, since after indictment the Government no longer has had an interest in keeping the agent\u2019s identity secret, and obviously will have to produce him as a witness at trial, a voluntary interview may be indicated. If need be, the judge might set appropriate bounds for an interview and arrange for the agent\u2019s participation therein. It may be that, by consent of the parties and approval of the judge, a deposition by written interrogatories to the agent would suffice as an expedient. Without any effort to exhaust the possibilities, we make these observations simply as suggestions of procedures calculated to safeguard Dancis against prejudice consistently with an orderly and expeditious progression of the case to trial. The point we do emphasize is that the judge is in a position to do anything the magistrate could now undertake, and indeed to do a great deal more. We leave for the trial judge, in the first instance, the decision on suitable relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b1280-4\">The judgment appealed from is reversed insofar as it denied the requested declaration that Dancis\u2019 preliminary hearing was rendered defective by the magistrate\u2019s refusal to allow a subpoena commanding the appearance of the undercover agent as a witness, and the case is remanded to the District Court in order that such a declaration may be made.<footnotemark>162</footnotemark> In all other respects, the judgment is affirmed, but without prejudice to steps in the criminal proceeding pending against Dancis which are designed to appropriately remedy the error committed at his preliminary hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1280-5\">So ordered.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1260-9\">.

First, the lawyer\u2019s skilled examination and cross-examination of witnesses may expose fatal weaknesses in the State\u2019s case that may lead the magistrate to refuse to bind the accused over. Second, in any event, the skilled interrogation of witnesses by an experienced lawyer can fashion a vital impeachment tool for use in eross-examination of the State\u2019s witnesses at the trial, or preserve testimony favorable to the accused of a witness who does not appear at the trial. Third, trained counsel can more effectively discover the case the State has against his client and make possible the preparation of a proper defense to meet that case at the trial. Fourth, counsel can also be influential at the preliminary hearing in making effective arguments for the accused on such matters as the necessity for an early psychiatric examination or bail.\u201d 399 U.S. at 9, 90 S.Ct. at 2003.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"72\">\n<p id=\"b1268-16\">. <em>E. g., </em>Powell v.

The argument, as we understand it, is not that hearsay must be as totally excluded from preliminary hearings as it is from trials, but seems rather to be that the elements of probable cause dependent upon eyewitness observations cannot be established on a wholly hearsay basis. \u201cCredible\u201d hearsay may underlie an arrest warrant. <em>E. g., </em>United States v. Harris, 403 U.S. 573, 579, 91 S.Ct. 2075, 29 L.Ed.2d 723 (1971); Whiteley v. Warden, 401 U.S. 560, 567, 91 S.Ct. 1031, 28 L.Ed.2d 306 (1971); United States v.

See Part IX (B), <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"96\">\n<p id=\"b1272-9\">. While the standard of probable cause which the Government must meet at preliminary hearings is roughly equivalent to the standard required for issuance of an arrest warrant or for an arrest without a warrant, see text <em>supra </em>at notes 77-81, the procedure at preliminary hearings differs from that upon the issuance of a warrant or a warrantless arrest in at least one very important respect. That difference ' is the presence of the accused at the preliminary hearing and his right to cross-examine prosecution witnesses and introduce evidence in his own behalf. Arrest warrants, on the other hand, are issued upon the Government\u2019s <em>ex parte </em>presentation to a magistrate, and warrant-less arrests are made on information communicated <em>ex parte </em>to arresting officers. The traditional function of the preliminary hearing is a second determination on probable cause, this time after according the accused a reasonable opportunity to rebut it. Unless the accused is indulged in that respect, the preliminary hearing is little more than a duplication of the probable cause decisions that foreran his arrest.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"97\">\n<p id=\"b1272-14\">.

See note 4, <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b1280-6\">FAHY, Senior Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AqtW\">concurring in part and dissenting in part:</p>\n<p id=\"b1280-7\">I concur in Part I (the Coleman case) of Judge Robinson\u2019s very careful and scholarly opinion. I also concur in Part III (Dancis\u2019 appeal). As to Part II (Shepard\u2019s appeal) I am of a different view. I think the cross-examination of the principal government witness was unduly restricted at the preliminary hearing. Unless subsequent events which are not considered by the court should lead to a different disposition of his case, I think he is entitled to a supplemental preliminary hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1280-10\">I accept the position that the purpose of the preliminary hearing was to determine probable cause and not to obtain discovery, but the effort of defense counsel in the cross-examination was to elicit testimony which bore upon the issue of probable cause. Shepard had been identified by the principal government witness as the one who had made the involved assault upon him. The magistrate explicitly recognized that the cross-examination was designed to impeach this witness. Defense counsel was endeavoring to show a situation of pandemonium in a cellblock, in which the officer\u2019s identification of Shepard as the one who attacked him might have been mistaken due to a general melee following racial slurs and an attack upon Shepard himself, who was felled and rendered unconscious with a fractured skull. Moreover, in the cross-examination counsel was not only seeking to test the credibility of the complaining witness but, in a good faith and intelligent, lawyer-like manner, was seeking to bring before the magistrate a fair exposition of what occurred, which had by no means been adequately developed by the government\u2019s witnesses. Thus, after being repeatedly rebuffed, counsel stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1280-11\">MR. AXELROD [defense counsel]: If I could show in this preliminary hearing, Your Honor, that the reason this charge was brought was to cover up a wrongful assault on Mr. Shepard, and you would let me go into some of these questions as to who made the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1213\">*1213</page-number>decision to charge and what Marshal Lonien [the complaining witness being examined] did afterwards, I think I could prove to Your Honor right now, before the case goes over to the District Court, that an assault didn\u2019t take place and this was a cover up. (P. 26 of Transcript of Preliminary Hearing.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1281-5\">THE COURT: Sir, you have heard what I said as to limitations I am placing on the evidence that will be admitted on this preliminary hearing. Within the scope of those limitations, you may proceed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1281-6\">The limitations in my opinion deprived the defense of a fair opportunity to probe the issue of probable cause as contemplated by Rule 5, F.R.Crim.P.</p>\n<p id=\"b1281-7\">It is clear that in seeking to impeach a witness on cross-examination counsel may question him on matters affecting credibility, including his lack of knowledge or perceptive capacity, his bias or his adverse interest in the litigation, and including also any prior inconsistent statements or acts. Rule 611(b) of the proposed new Rules of Evidence explicitly grants the right to go beyond the scope of the direct in cross-examination of a witness in a jury trial, with discretion in the judge as indicated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1281-8\">A witness may be cross-examined on any matter relevant to any issue in the case, including credibility. In the interests of justice, the judge may limit cross-examination with respect to matters not testified to on direct examination.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1281-9\">Here the witness was the complaining witness, and the cross-examination was not before a jury during a trial but before a judge at a preliminary hearing, during which both hearsay and otherwise inadmissible evidence may be presented. Rule 5.1, F.R.Crim.P., effective October 1, 1972. The overly restrictive limitations imposed upon counsel are not in keeping with these developments.</p>\n<p id=\"b1281-10\">Moreover, \u201cdiscovery\u201d by the time-honored method of seeking the truth\u2014 proper cross-examination \u2014 provided at a preliminary hearing the discovery is incidental to the issue of probable cause, is in. line with the modern trend for greater discovery in criminal proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b1281-12\">Unless intervening events which, as I have said, we have not considered, should preclude it, I would require that Shepard now be given a supplemental probable cause hearing. Only about an hour would be consumed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
