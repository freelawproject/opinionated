No physician is provided by the Center for any resident; each resident makes his own arrangements for his own personal physician. The Center is administered by the Reverend Frederick Juilfs, and an office manager, one Director of Nursing, one Supervising Registered Nurse, and three additional registered nurses. (These supervise licensed practical nurses, nurses aides and orderlies. The latter work in three shifts interchangeably throughout the Center.)</p>\n<p id=\"b366-19\">We have for review several questions; the first and most important being:</p>\n<p id=\"b366-20\">Was the Center an \u201cemployer\u201d within the National Labor Relations Act, or was the Center exempt as a non-profit hospital, under \u00a7 2(2) of the Act?</p>\n<p id=\"b366-21\">Originally the Board, in the exercise of its administrative discretion, had declined to exercise jurisdiction over proprietary (profit) hospitals, and nursing homes (either non-profit or proprietary), primarily because of (a) their local nature, (b) the probability that their labor disputes would be regulated by state law, and (c) their insubstantial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>impact upon interstate commerce. Flatbush General Hospital, 126 NLRB 144 (1960). Seven years later, in 1967, the Board overruled <em>Flatbush, </em>extending jurisdiction to proprietary hospitals with gross revenues of $250,000 per year. Butte Medical Properties, etc., 168 NLRB 266 (1967); and on the same date, exercised jurisdiction over the nursing home industry, if such homes were operated for a profit, and had a gross income of $100,000 per year. University Nursing Homes, Inc., 168 NLRB 263 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b367-4\">Finally, the Board extended its jurisdiction to <em>non-profit </em>nursing homes. Drexel Homes, Inc., 182 NLRB 1045 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">In so extending its jurisdiction, the Board found it necessary to contend with various semantic terms \u2014 \u201crest homes\u201d, \u201chomes for the aged\u201d, \u201cretirement homes\u201d, \u201cconvalescent homes\u201d, \u201csanitariums\u201d. It solved its problem by determining it would exercise jurisdiction over operations offering <em>\u201cextended care </em>facilities\u201d; accepting the American Hospital Association\u2019s definition thereof: \u201can establishment with permanent facilities that include inpatient beds; and with medical services, including continuous nursing services, to provide treatment to patients who require inpatient care but <em>do not require hospital services.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b367-6\">\u201cHospital Services\u201d are those ordinarily available only in a general hospital, including facilities for surgery, x-ray, laboratory analysis, obstetrics, and related <em>specialized </em>procedures. Wesleyan Foundation, 171 NLRB 124 (1968); Sierra Hospital Foundation, 181 NLRB 869 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b367-7\">The Board determined the appellant was not a hospital within the meaning of \u00a7 2(2) of the Act, but was \u201can extended care facility\u201d. We are bound to accept the Board\u2019s determination if it has a reasonable basis in the evidence, and is not inconsistent with the law. NLRB v. E. C. Akins &amp; Co., 331 U.S. 398, 403, 67 S.Ct. 1265, 91 L.Ed. 1563 (1947).</p>\n<p id=\"b367-8\">Appellant urges that the Board\u2019s findings support the Board\u2019s ruling, but that the facts do not support its Findings. We hold otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-9\">It is true that under the law of the State of Oregon, appellant\u2019s Wing 700 was licensed as a 30-bed \u201cconvalescent hospital\u201d, and the other six units as an 118-bed \u201cnursing home.\u201d Reciting the facts hereinbefore listed, and quoting language from Drexel Homes, Inc., <em>supra, </em>the Trial Examiner found \u201cthat the Center is similar to the establishment involved in Drexel Homes, Inc.\u201d (judged by the American Hospital Association\u2019s definition (R. 19)), and that it did not supply \u201cgeneral or in most instances any, hospital services.\u201d The Trial Examiner apparently strongly relied on the fact that Respondent had no medical staff, per se, but that each patient, if he or she wished, had a personal physician. \u201cThe residents and patients of all seven wings of the Center have social activities and religious services available,\u201d but not doctors nor any care for those \u201cacutely ill.\u201d The Center advertised itself as a center for retired people; that residents may \u201cgo and come as you please.\u201d The Examiner found that the patients in Wing 700 \u201cexcept for being closer to the Registered Nurse in charge of the Center, received the same standard of care as other patients or residents of the Center\u201d (R. 22). He also found that Medicare recognized the necessity at times, after hospital care, of care from an \u201cextended care facility\u201d. Half of the patients in Wing 700 were in this class, and on Medicare. (Board\u2019s Opening Brief, p. 17, note 22).</p>\n<p id=\"b367-10\">We cannot rule that the Examiner\u2019s findings, in view of the holdings of the cases cited, were not supported by substantial evidence or that they were arbitrary or capricious. We reject the \u201cintegral\u201d theory relied on by the Respondent to bring its operation within the hospital exemption, and we affirm the jurisdiction of the Board over the Center\u2019s operations.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number> There is little doubt but that the facts before us demonstrate substantial support for the Board\u2019s findings that the Center interfered with, restrained and coerced its employees, in violation of \u00a7 8(a)(1) of the Act. A threatened shut-down of the Center and loss of jobs was threatened by Director of Nursing Moore to two of her nurses (Skinner and Anderson), if they persisted in their union support. <em>Cf. </em>NLRB v. Gissel Packing Co., 395 U.S. 575, 618-619, 89 S.Ct. 1918, 23 L.Ed.2d 547 (1969). Nor can we hold, contrary to the Board\u2019s findings, that the licensed practical nurses were supervisors. Garden of Eden Home, Inc., etc., 199 NLRB No. 5 (September 14, 1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b368-4\">The Board\u2019s Order will be enforced in full.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
