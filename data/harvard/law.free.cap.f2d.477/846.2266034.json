His ground for attack is that the affidavit supporting the warrant was based on information obtained from his purported wife after her arrest without probable cause. He asserts the fruit of the poisonous tree doctrine. The search was of a trailer-home occupied by appellant and his purported wife.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The district court held that appellant lacked standing to assert in his own defense the defalcation of the officers toward the wife. We agree. See Alderman v. United States (1969) 394 U.S. 165, 174, 89 S.Ct. 961, 22 L.Ed.2d 176, 187; Wong Sun v. United States (1963) 371 U.S. 471, 491-492, 83 S.Ct. 407, 9 L.Ed.2d 441, 458.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-22\">The assignments of error based on the alleged illegal arrest of appellant and the search of his automobile are without merit. No product of the arrest was used against appellant in connection with his trial and conviction. The evidence obtained from the search of appel-) lant\u2019s automobile was not improperly admitted. The automobile was not searched at the time of appellant\u2019s illegal arrest, but only upon a search war-, rant which was issued on information also obtained from appellant\u2019s purported wife.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-23\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b914-24\">. The district court found that the purported wife was not in fact appellant\u2019s wife but that they were occupying the trailer-home together.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
