Appellant asserted that the mark so resembles its registered marks DEE CEE for \u201cshirts, jackets, slacks, shorts, dungarees, and pajamas for men, women, and children,\u201d Registration No. 791,077 issued June 15, 1965, and \u201cDEE-CEE\u201d for virtually the same goods, Registration No. 691,712 issued January 19, 1960, that there is a likelihood of confusion, mistake or deception within the meaning of \u00a7 2(d) of the L\u00e1nham Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1052(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-13\">The board concluded that when the marks DEE DEE DEB and DEE CEE are viewed in their entireties, the resemblance is not such as to reasonably lead to a likelihood of confusion. We agree with both the reasoning and conclusion of the board in this ease. The decision of the board is accordingly affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-15\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
