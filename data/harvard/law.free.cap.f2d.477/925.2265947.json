Pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 709(a) and 710(a) of the Act, the EEOC filed a Demand for Access to Evidence of appellant. Within the allowed statutory period provided by \u00a7 710(c), appellant filed a petition in the United States District Court for the District of Utah, Central Division, to Dismiss Commissioner\u2019s Charge and to Set Aside or Modify Demand for Access to Evidence. The EEOC cross-petitioned for an order enforcing its demand. In a Memorandum Decision filed September 2, 1971, the District Court denied appellant\u2019s petition and allowed the cross-petition of appellees seeking enforcement of its demand for access to evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b994-15\">The sole issue before this court is whether the Commissioner\u2019s charge sets forth facts with sufficient specificity to satisfy the requirements of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(a) <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and thus warrant the enforcement of the Commissioner\u2019s demand for access to evidence. The charge by the Commissioner alleged:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b994-16\">Respondent diseriminatorily fails and/or refuses to recruit and/or hire Negroes, American Indians in the same manner in which it hires and/or recruits Anglos.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b995-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"927\">*927</page-number>Respondent diseriminatorily fails to provide Negroes, American Indians, and Spanish Surnamed Americans with an equal opportunity for promotions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A6z\">Subsequent to the district court\u2019s decision in this case, denying the motion of appellant and granting relief to the Commissioner, we dealt with the mentioned issue now presented here for review. <em>See </em>Mountain States Tel. &amp; Tel. Co. v. EEOC, 466 F.2d 541 (10th Cir. 1972); Coors Co. v. EEOC, 464 F.2d 1270 (10th Cir. 1972, cert. denied, 410 U.S. 929, 93 S.Ct. 1365, 35 L.Ed.2d 584; Sparton Southwest, Inc. v. EEOC, 461 F.2d 1055 (10th Cir. 1972). These decisions control the present controversy. Accordingly, the judgment of the district .court is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b994-11\">. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(a) provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b994-12\">(a) Whenever it is charged in writing under oath by a person claiming to be aggrieved, or a written charge has been filed by a member of the Commission where he has reasonable cause to believe a violation of this subchapter has occurred (and such charge sets forth the facts upon which it is based) that an employer, employment agency, or labor organization has engaged in an unlawful employment practice * * *</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
