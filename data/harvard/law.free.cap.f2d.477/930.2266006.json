In November 1964 plaintiff William Green Construction Company (Green) agreed with the General Services Administration to build a women\u2019s residence hall at Howard University in the District of Columbia (the Howard University contract). About the same time Green also contracted with GSA to construct a Post Office and Federal Office Building in Portsmouth, New Hampshire (the FOB contract). A year and one-half later, the same agency arranged with plaintiff Green to erect the National Training School for Boys in Morgan-town, West Virginia (Training School contract). Plaintiff United States Fidelity &amp; Guaranty Company (USF &amp; G) was the surety on the Howard University and FOB contracts; another company was surety on the Training School agreement. Green was also working, during this period, on three nonfederal projects on which USF &amp; G was surety.</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"933\">*933</page-number>In 1965-1966, during performance of the Howard University work, the contractor and the defendant had a serious dispute whether certain of the government specifications were defective and impossible to carry out. When Green refused on that ground to go forward, the contracting officer terminated for default. Green challenged this determination, insisting that its inability to proceed was justified by the defects in the defendant\u2019s requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-4\">In the discussions which followed, defendant indicated that it intended to set off, against amounts which would be owing on the other two of Green\u2019s federal contracts, the liquidated damages and excess completion costs assessable with respect to the just-terminated Howard University agreement. Green responded that such set-offs were improper \u2014 because the default-termination was unwarranted \u2014 and would make it financially impossible to proceed with completion of the other two contracts, and, more than that, the contractor\u2019s entire business would be destroyed. For this reason, Green and USF &amp; G asked the GSA to isolate the Howard University dispute and not to impose set-offs, but the Government refused to make such a commitment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-5\">Shortly after the Government had made it clear that it fully maintained its right of set-off, but before any set-off had actually occurred, Green informed GSA that, because of the threat to reduce payments on the other projects, it was financially unable to, and would not, proceed with the FOB and Training School contracts. These two agreements were then terminated by the Government for default. USF &amp; G completed the FOB work, and apparently the other surety did the same for the Training School contract. Green likewise failed to complete the three nonfederal contracts it had, and went out of business.</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-6\">Green appealed to the General Services Board of Contract Appeals from the default-termination of the Howard University contract, but it never sought review by the Board of the defaults with respect to FOB and Training School. The Howard appeal asked, not only for the conventional modern adjustment for an improper default-termination,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> but also for damages for losses on FOB and Training School, as well as on the non-federal projects, and for loss of Green\u2019s business as a whole. Because of the inclusion of these items of recovery, the Government moved the board to dismiss the appeal as for \u201cbreach of contract\u201d and \u201cunliquidated damages\u201d, beyond the board\u2019s authority. In 1968 the board partially granted this motion, dismissing all claims except that for an equitable adjustment under convenience-termination standards.</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-12\">Later, in 1971, the parties stipulated before the board that Green \u201cwas not in default at the time it received notice of the termination [of the Howard University contract] and the Government concedes the termination for default was erroneously made by the contracting officer. The appeal, therefore, should be granted as defined by the prior decisions of the Board in this ease.\u201d The GSBCA then found that the contractor\u2019s \u201cright to proceed under the contract was improperly terminated for default\u201d, and remanded to the contracting officer to determine the equitable adjustment for the unreimbursed costs of performing the Howard work. The stipulation expressly provided that \u201cany equitable adjustment under the contract shall not be prejudicial to [the contractor\u2019s] right to proceed in the Court of Claims for additional damages not the subject of such equitable adjustment.\u201d GSBCA No. 2114, 71-2 BCA \u00b6 9116.</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-13\">In 1972 Green and USF &amp; G brought this action, alleging what we have thus far set forth, asking for the large damages (over $2,700,000) the board had dismissed from the Howard appeal, and claiming that those damages are recov<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"934\">*934</page-number>erable on the theory that the United States breached all three of Green\u2019s federal contracts. Count I of the petition asserts the full claim as a breach of the Howard contract, while Count II bottoms the very same claim on alleged breach of the FOB and Training School agreements. Defendant has moved to dismiss the petition for failing to state any proper claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-4\">We think that the claimants do not have a \u201cbreach\u201d claim against defendant on any of the three contracts, but that plaintiff Green does have a right to a convenience-termination type of equitable adjustment, under all three of them, and that such adjustments should be awarded administratively. We discuss the three agreements <em>seriatim,.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1002-5\"><em>Howard University contract (Count I): </em>The defendant\u2019s notice of default-termination of the Howard contract triggered the default-termination clause which provided that, if it was determined for any reason \u201cthat the Contractor was not in default under the provisions of this clause\u201d, or that \u201cthe delay was excusable\u201d, the matter was to be treated as a convenience-termination if the contract contained a convenience-termination article, and, if not, the contract was to \u201cbe equitably adjusted to compensate for such termination.\u201d We have held that the latter alternative calls for the general equivalent of a convenience-termination award. General Builders Supply Co. v. United States, 409 F.2d 246, 187 Ct.Cl. 477 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-6\"> It follows that when the GSBCA determined that Green\u2019s right to proceed was wrongfully ended, and remanded for an appropriate adjustment, the contractor received the maximum to which it was entitled under the contract. There is no present complaint as to the amount of the equitable adjustment, and plaintiffs do not contend that such an award can or should cover the types of consequential damage they seek here. The petition suggests, however, that a breach claim for a wrongful default-termination somehow survived for these additional items of recovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-7\">But it is very plain under our decisions that the administrative remedy is the only one available to the contractor. Green does not retain a \u201cbreach\u201d claim, for an improper default, which can be brought in court and through which a supplemental award can be obtained. <em>See </em>General Builders Supply Co., <em>supra, </em>409 F.2d at 248 n. 3, 187 Ct.Cl. at 480 n. 3; G. C. Casebolt Co. v. United States, 421 F.2d 710, 712, 190 Ct.Cl. 783, 486-487 (1970). The exclusive remedy \u201cunder the contract\u201d substitutes for the \u201cbreach\u201d claim which would otherwise exist, and becomes the claimant\u2019s sole form of relief. The measure of recovery for a convenience-termination \u2014 costs incurred, plus a reasonable profit on work performed \u2014 is an adequate replacement for the common-law cause of action. <em>See infra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1002-8\">It is worth noting, in addition, that in any event the type of consequential damage for which plaintiffs now press could not be obtained under Count I even if there were no such default-termination clause in the contract and this suit were properly one for common-law breach for wrongful cancellation of the Howard University pact. On the face of the petition it was not the wrongful termination itself which caused either Green\u2019s inability to proceed on the other two federal contracts, or the stoppage of work on the three nonfederal projects, or plaintiff\u2019s eventual going-out-of-business, but the subsequent and separate threat of set-offs against payments owing on the FOB and Training School projects. Whatever else those threats may have been, they were in no way violations of the Howard contract, nor were they directly or integrally linked to the Howard default termination. They were, instead, independent acts of the Government directed to the other two federal projects.</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-9\">Accordingly, defendant is quite right that Count I fails to state any claim at all and must be dismissed <em>in toto. </em>The equitable adjustment which Green is receiving, through the administrative pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"935\">*935</page-number>ceedings, is all that it merits with respect to the Howard contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-4\"><em>FOB contract (Count </em>II): A. Even if the default-termination of the FOB agreement was invalid, Green should have appealed to the GSBCA, just as it sought review of the Howard termination. That was the channel expressly marked out by the contract and it should have been followed. If the FOB termination was improper, an equitable adjustment would be made under that contract which embodied the same default-termination form as the Howard agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-5\">Plaintiffs try to avoid this conclusion by a number of arguments which we must reject. The first is that the claim in Count II is not for wrongful termination but for anticipatory breach of the FOB contract, through refusal to make progress payments. This is but a choice of phrasing to camouflage the irrefutable fact that the only detriment which came, or could come, to plaintiffs would be through a wrongful default-termination. Neither claimant suffered harm from the mere threat to withhold payment; neither would have suffered the harm charged from an actual withholding, if that is all there were. The injury could only come if the Government insisted that plaintiffs continued to have obligations under the FOB contract. If, for instance, the GSA had acquiesced (after the set-off threat) in Green\u2019s abandonment of the FOB project, the denial of progress payments would not interfere with performance because there would be no further work to be done or paid for. A failure to issue a default-termination would amount to an acquiescence in abandonment. <em>Cf. </em>Ling-Temco-Vought, Inc. v. United States, 475 F.2d 630, 201 Ct.Cl. - (1973). Thus, it was only the defendant\u2019s insistence, via the default-termination notice, that plaintiffs continued to have obligations under the FOB contract which precipitated any of the harms alleged. That was the heart of the matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-11\">As in Allied Paint Mfg. Co. v. United States, 470 F.2d 556, 200 Ct.Cl. - (Dec. 1972), the contractor could have attacked the termination, through an appeal to the GSBCA, on the ground that other acts of the Government <em>(i. e., </em>the threats of set-off) excused Green\u2019s failure to proceed.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Another comparable case is Nolan Bros., Inc. v. United States, 405 F.2d 1250, 186 Ct.Cl. 602 (1969), in which we held that a convenience-termination subsumed and obviated an independent breach claim for defective design. We pointed out, in words directly applicable to the present case, \u201cIf the Government, as it might have done, had terminated the contract for default because plaintiff lagged (on account of the defective specifications) and the default was found excusable (as due to the defendant\u2019s own fault), the termination would be converted, under the default clause, into a convenience-termination * * * \u201d, with the plaintiff recovering costs incurred plus a measure of profit, but not unearned profits. 405 F.2d at 1253, 1255, 186 Ct.Cl. at 607, 609-610. Plaintiff\u2019s so-called \u201cbreach\u201d claim has, in short, no viability independent of the validity of the default-termination, and that could be readily challenged through the \u201cdisputes\u201d procedure.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1004-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"936\">*936</page-number>A second of claimant\u2019s positions is that the entire termination-and-disputes remedy was aborted before the default notice. In Nolan Bros., Inc., <em>supra, </em>405 F.2d at 1255 n. 5, 186 Ct.Cl. at 609 n. 5, we set apart \u201ca case in which the contractor treats a government breach of warranty as ending the entire contractual relationship before the defendant attempts to exercise its right of termination.\u201d Plaintiffs say that that is what happened here \u2014 that the whole contract was effectively ended before the default-termination \u2014 but their current stance is conclusively refuted by the significant fact that USF &amp; G undertook to complete the FOB project after the termination. If the contract was not subsisting at that time, neither Green nor USF &amp; G would have been under any obligation; the existence of the contract was the essential predicate for the surety\u2019s agreement to complete. As in <em>Nolan, </em>we cannot see the plaintiffs had put an end to, or thought that they had put an end to, the contract before the Government invoked the default clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-4\">The third point is that the set-off threats constituted a cardinal change, by effectively deleting the progress payment provisions of the FOB contract, and that a cardinal change is redressable only in court, not administratively. <em>See </em>Edward R. Marden Corp. v. United States, 442 F.2d 364, 194 Ct.Cl. 799 (1971). We do not agree that it is a contract change of any kind \u2014 cardinal or ordinary \u2014 for the Government to set-off against progress payments (let alone merely threatening to set-off) a federal claim on another contract (with the same contractor) which is believed in good faith, but mistakenly, to be valid. This is simply an exercise of the established right of set-off <em>(see </em>United States v. Munsey Trust Co., 332 U.S. 234, 67 S.Ct. 1599, 91 L.Ed. 2022 (1947); Burlington Northern Inc. v. United States, 462 F.2d 526, 199 Ct.Cl. 143 (July 1972)), which is not transformed into something else because the defendant\u2019s claim turns out later to be without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-6\">In any event, and assuming for argument\u2019s sake that the threats of set-off did equal a cardinal change excising the progress-payment provisions, it does not follow that such a \u201cbreach\u201d claim would be any different from the \u201cbreach\u201d claim in this case for simple violation of the progress-payments clause. As we have pointed out, that claim is swallowed up by the default-termination which was the event causing plaintiffs\u2019 detriment. Violation of the payments article, or even .its deletion, would not have brought about the chain-of-events asserted by Green and USF &amp; G if it were not for the default-termination. From claimants\u2019 viewpoint that was the real villain in the drama, whom they should have pursued on his own scene.</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-7\">Lastly, we are told that an equitable adjustment of the convenience-termination type does not give full enough relief for the injuries suffered, and therefore plaintiffs should be allowed to seek, through this court, the part of the remedy which the administrative award cannot give them. The answer is that the premise is incorrect. \u201cThe only substantial difference between the sum calculated under\u201d equitable adjustment or convenience-termination standards \u201cand the amount recoverable in a common law action for contract breach is the noninclusion in the former of anticipated but unearned profits.\u201d Nolan Bros., Inc. v. United States, <em>supra, </em>405 F.2d at 1253, 186 Ct.Cl. at 607. This exclusion from relief of unearned profits is a settled policy which has long been accepted and enforced. 405 F.2d at 1254, 1255, 186 Ct.Cl. at 608-609, General Builders Supply Co. v. United States, <em>supra, </em>409 F.2d at 251, 187 Ct.Cl. at 485-486; G. C. Casebolt Co. v. United States, <em>supra, </em>421 F.2d at 713, 190 Ct.Cl. at 788. And even in a common-law suit there would be no recovery for general loss of business, the claimed loss of the entire Green net worth, and losses on the non-federal work \u2014 such damages are all deemed too remote and consequential. <em>See </em>Ramsey v. United States, 101 F.Supp. 353, 357-358, 121 Ct.Cl. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"937\">*937</page-number>426, 433-435 (1951), cert. denied, 343 U.S. 977, 72 S.Ct. 1072, 96 L.Ed. 1369 (1952); Dale Constr. Co. v. United States, 168 Ct.Cl. 692, 738 (1964); Specialty Assembly &amp; Packing Co. v. United States, 355 F.2d 554, 567, 568, 174 Ct.Cl. 153, 175 (1966). The conclusion must be that the administrative remedy is, as we have already said, a full and permissible substitute for the award of damages under the former \u201cbreach\u201d claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-4\">Plaintiffs err therefore in seeing themselves as under no duty to proceed administratively. On the contrary, Green should have appealed from the default-termination of the FOB contract and obtained its relief in that fashion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-5\">B. Not unexpectedly, the defendant suggests that, having failed to appeal, Green is now barred forever. We follow, instead, the rule of Zidell Explorations, Inc. v. United States, 427 F.2d 735, 737-738, 192 Ct.Cl. 331, 335-336 (1970), that, if the circumstances warrant, we will give a contractor who has failed to appeal a second chance. The time-limit for appeals to contract appeals boards is not beyond enlargement (Maney Aircraft Parts, Inc. v. United States, 453 F.2d 1260, 197 Ct.Cl. 159 (1972); Monroe M. Tapper &amp; Associates v. United States, 458 F.2d 66, 198 Ct.Cl. 72 (1972)), and the Act of August 29, 1972, Pub.L. No. 92-415, 86 Stat. 652, gives us power to remand to a board \u201cwith such direction as it [the court] may deem proper and just.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-6\">To our mind this is a case, like <em>Zidell, </em>in which we should not rigidly hold the contractor to its original decision not to appeal. The three federal contracts were linked in plaintiff\u2019s mind and it may have considered the enlarged recovery it originally sought in the Howard administrative proceedings to be a sufficient method of covering all three determinations.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Then, too, plaintiff may well have been misled by its view, still strenuously espoused here, that its claims are entirely \u201cbreach\u201d claims for court trial. We referred in <em>Zidell </em>to the great confusion since United States v. Carlo Bianchi &amp; Co., 373 U.S. 709, 83 S.Ct. 1409, 10 L.Ed.2d 652 (1963), over which cases properly fall \u201cunder the contract\u201d and which are for \u201cbreach\u201d. This case is a prime exemplar. Especially since plaintiffs appear to have a valid right to substantial further relief, they should not be eternally punished for their initial mistaken choice of procedure.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The case should go to the GSBCA for processing under the default-termination clause of the FOB contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-10\">C. There has, as yet, been no decision that the termination of the FOB agreement was improper, but we think that on the undisputed facts there is no doubt that it was, and we now so hold as a matter of law since the board could not validly decide otherwise. All must now accept the Howard termination as incorrect; Green was not in default on that project and the default-termination was erroneously made by the contracting officer. There were, accordingly, no liquidated damages and no excess construction costs which could properly be offset against the FOB and Training School contracts. That threats to offset were nevertheless made is undisputed and indisputable. The connection is also clear between those threats and Green\u2019s stopping work on the FOB and Training School projects. Defendant does not even hint that this stoppage was unrelated to, or had some cause other than, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"938\">*938</page-number>the menace of set-off.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Nor is there any suggestion that plaintiffs are mistaken when they say they warned the defendant that they would need the progress payments on the two contracts, without substantial diminution.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> There is, moreover, not the slightest basis for thinking that Green should (or could) have gotten the necessary money from other sources.</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-4\">It follows, we think, that Green\u2019s refusal to proceed on FOB must now be held to be excused. A serious threat in these circumstances to withhold necessary progress payments because of an erroneous off-set claim on another contract is an act of the Government, not attributable to the contractor, which excuses whatever technical default there may be. Construction contractors cannot be expected to continue working if the Government improperly holds back on substantial interim payments which enable the project to proceed. <em>Cf. </em>Litchfield Mfg. Corp. v. United States, 338 F.2d 94, 167 Ct.Cl. 604 (1964); Pigeon v. United States, 27 Ct.Cl. 167, 175-176 (1892); Overstreet v. United States, 55 Ct.Cl. 154, 173-174 (1920).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1006-5\">D. The equitable adjustment to which Green is entitled under the FOB contract includes, not only the costs it incurred itself before termination, but also USF &amp; G\u2019s excess costs in completing the project. Defendant admits <footnotemark>9</footnotemark> that, when a default-termination is converted to a convenience-termination, the contractor is entitled to any liquidated damages and reprocurement costs paid following the termination. That would include, since the surety stands here in the contractor\u2019s place,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> USF &amp; G\u2019s unreimbursed excess completion costs, if appropriate and reasonable. <em>Cf. </em>J. D. Hedin Constr. Co. v. United States, 456 F.2d 1315, 1320-1327, 197 Ct.Cl. 782, 790-803 (1972). The equitable adjustment called for by the contract is flexible enough to cover that item, to the extent the contractor has incurred such costs as a result of the wrongful termination.</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-11\">On the other hand, as we have already indicated, USF &amp; G\u2019s costs of completing the three non-federal contracts, and the loss of Green\u2019s net worth, are not proper items for an equitable adjustment under the FOB and Training School contracts.</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-12\"><em>Training School contract (Count II): </em>What we have said as to the FOB contract controls the Training School agreement. USF &amp; G was not surety for that work and the petition therefore does not ask for recovery of amounts expended by the other surety (which is not a plaintiff here). But if the other surety has a claim, through Green, with respect to completion of the Training School comparable to that of USF &amp; G for completion of FOB, the Training School equitable adjustment should take account of it if presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"939\">*939</page-number>Defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss the petition is fully granted as to Count I, but as to Count II the court makes the following disposition: (a) the petition is dismissed to the extent that a claim for \u201cbreach\u201d of the FOB and Training School contracts, triable in court, is stated; (b) the petition is construed as alternatively seeking equitable adjustments under those two contracts;<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and (c) the request for such equitable adjustment is remanded to the GSBCA under P.L. 92-415, 86 Stat. 652, this opinion, and General Order No. 3 of 1972, for appropriate administrative proceedings.

In <em>Allied Paint Mfg.

Green might have waited until a set-off was actually made, but the GSA\u2019s intention had been made very plain and there apparently was planning and preparation work to do which would be entirely wasted if plaintiffs were not going forward once a set-off was actually made. In the circumstances we do not think Green was compelled to await an actual set-off.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b1006-15\">.

USF &amp; G has paid all laborers and materialmen, and Green is liable to USF &amp; G for the full amount of the loss suffered in completing the FOB contract.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b1007-12\">.
