The Regional Director opined that \u201cwhile the employer\u2019s argument has some appeal, the <em>Ideal Electric </em>holding appears to state a mechanical rule and no exceptions to its application appear to be contemplated. Accordingly, as the undersigned is bound by the Board\u2019s decision in <em>Ideal Electric, </em>it is concluded that objections one through six are not meritorious.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b561-13\">KOELSCH, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b561-14\">The National Labor Relations Board seeks enforcement of its order directing R. Dakin and Company to bargain with Warehouse Union Local No. 860.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-18\">The record discloses that the Union filed three representation (election) petitions within a period of three months; that it withdrew the first two, and that the third eventuated in the election which the Union won. All three petitions were identical in content. In due time Dakin filed objections with the Board; it sought to have the election set aside on grounds of Union misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-19\">Pursuant to Board Rules and Regulations, 29 C.F.R. 102.69(c), the Regional Director conducted an administrative investigation into the matter. He noted in his Report on Objections \u201cthat the investigation has raised a substantial and material issue of fact \u2014 -\u201cbut he refused to consider the objections on the merits, because all the misconduct allegedly occurred prior to the last petition \u2014 which he deemed the operative one. As support for this procedure he expressly relied upon Ideal Electric &amp; Mfg. Co. (134 N.L.R.B. 1275 (1961)), a case in which the Board had ruled \u201cthat the date of filing of the petition . . . should be the cutoff time in considering alleged objectionable conduct in contested cases.\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b561-21\">Dakin filed timely exceptions to the Regional Director\u2019s Report; it urged that the \u201ccut off\u201d date should be the date of the filing of the first representation petition; and in the alternative that the Ideal Electric rule, as applied in this matter, was arbitrary. The Board, however, summarily adopted the Regional Director\u2019s findings and recommendations, approved his rationale, and certified the Union as bargaining representative for Dakin\u2019s employees. Dakin nevertheless refused to bargain. A complaint issued. Dakin again urged that a hearing should be held upon its objections to the election. But the Board, like the Regional Director, invoked the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>Ideal Electric Rule and refused to entertain them.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> (181 N.L.R.B. 572).</p>\n<p id=\"b562-4\">Before initiating this enforcement proceeding the Board sua sponte, \u201cwish[ing] to have the benefit of record testimony concerning allegations of conduct which transpired following October 14, 1968, the date on which the first petition was filed . . .\u201d reopened the case. The trial examiner, to whom the matter was referred for hearing, found that all the alleged Union misconduct antedated the third election petition and that the Union\u2019s withdrawal of the earlier petitions was not in bad faith and to \u201cclean the slate.\u201d Thereupon, the Board adopted the examiner\u2019s findings and reaffirmed its decision.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b562-6\">The record supports the Board\u2019s adopted findings concerning the two initial petitions. Thus the question remains, did the Board err in \u201cmechanically\u201d applying the Ideal Electric rule?</p>\n<p id=\"b562-7\">We conclude that the answer is yes. Ideal Electric makes clear that the rule is simply an evidentiary device calculated to render irrelevant upon a post election contest, conduct \u201ctoo remote\u201d to have interfered with the employees\u2019 exercise of the free choice guaranteed by Sec. 7 of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-8\">In a proper case such a rule undoubtedly serves a worthwhile purpose. But if its predicate is lacking, then an indiscriminate application serves as a blanket exclusion of all evidence from consideration without regard to materiality.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-14\">We of course recognize \u201cthe function of the Labor Board as one of those agencies presumably equipped or informed by experience to deal with a specialized field of knowledge, whose findings within that field carry the authority of an expertness which courts do not possess and therefore must respect.\u201d Universal Camera Corp. v. N.L.R.B., 340 U.S. 474, 488, 71 S.Ct. 456, 465, 95 L.Ed. 456 (1951). Consistent with this principle, we would pay great deference to a Board created cut-off date which is applied to some types of pre-election misconduct, even though we might believe that the lapse of time was not of sufficient length to render that conduct innocuous. But, we are not prepared to give our approval to a rule which flatly bars the consideration of all pre-petition misconduct, particularly where, as here, the Regional Director concluded, and the Board affirmed, that such alleged misconduct \u201craised a substantial and material issue of fact\u201d regarding the validity of the election. The Tenth Circuit shares this view: N.L.R.B. v. Lawrence Typographical Union, 376 F.2d 643 (10th Cir. 1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b562-15\">The Order is set aside and the matter is remanded to the Board for further proceedings.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b562-9\">. It would be improper for us to distinguish Ideal Electric, where the Board has itself declared the decision controlling. The Board has not always regarded cutoff dates as inflexible. In fact, Ideal Electric is a decision in which the Board modified its then current cut-off rule (as previously fixed in F. W. Woolworth Co., 109 N.L.R.B. 1446) to accommodate evidence of pre-election misconduct which would have been otherwise inadmissible. Nor has the Board always abided by the Ideal Electric rule. Thus in Weather Seal, Inc., 161 N.L.R.B. 1226 (1966) the Board, although expressly finding that \u201calmost all\u201d the acts which constituted employee coercion antedated \u201cthe critical period prior to the election\u201d (citing Ideal Electric), nevertheless considered those acts in deciding to set aside the election.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b562-16\">. Dakin\u2019s contention that enforcement of the Board\u2019s order should be denied because \u201cthe presentation of the Company\u2019s case after almost two years of administrative intransigence was hopelessly impaired,\u201d is not persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-17\">At the hearing, Dakin\u2019s counsel urged that the delay had rendered unavailable several prospective witnesses, but he also stated that those persons would be merely \u201ccorroborating witnesses . . . . \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b562-18\">Not only does Dakin fail to specify any actual prejudice, but we think it would be extremely unlikely that it could do so, for the witness to whom the Union\u2019s coercive statements were allegedly made was present and testified and was credited by the trial examiner.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
