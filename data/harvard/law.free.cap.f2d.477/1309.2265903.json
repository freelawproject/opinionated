Neither Gonzales nor Vargas testified on his own behalf. Morales did testify, admitting participation in the sale, but insisting that Davila deceived him into believing that the transaction was a normal sale of genuine heroin to a nonagent.</p>\n<p id=\"b1378-18\">On appeal, Morales- argues (1) that the trial court erred in allowing the jury to convict on the strength of the uncorroborated, \u201cincredible\u201d testimony of Davila and (2) that admission of the extra-judicial confessions of Gonzales and Vargas violated the rule of Bruton v. United States, 1968, 391 U.S. 123, 88 S.Ct. 1620, 20 L.Ed.2d 476, by inculpating Morales without affording him the constitutional right to confront his accusers. Gonzales attacks the propriety of his conviction on the two grounds asserted by Morales and contends, in addition, that he was entrapped. We reverse Morales\u2019 conviction, but affirm the conviction of Gonzales.</p>\n<p id=\"b1379-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1311\">*1311</page-number>\n<em>THE CONSPIRACY</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"A3_\">By his own admission, Davila set in motion the bizarre chain of events, which culminated in the fraudulent sale. (Rec Vol. II, p. 181.) He contacted BNDD Agent Nattinger for whom he had worked as an informer in the past, identified himself, and promised to arrange a heroin purchase between an undercover BNDD agent and a notorious local pusher named Esquivel (see Agent Nattinger\u2019s testimony at Rec. Vol. II, pp. 27-29). Davila had no direct contact with Esquivel; he lied to the government from the start.</p>\n<p id=\"b1379-5\">According to the plan reached between Davila and the government, BNDD Agent Lozano would pose as an out-of-town buyer from Houston and rent a room at the Holiday Inn in San Antonio where the exchange with Esquivel would take place under heavy surveillance.</p>\n<p id=\"b1379-6\">After the scheme was formulated, Davila enlisted the aid of appellants who agreed to help make the delivery. Gonzales accompanied Vargas who drove to the Holiday Inn parking lot on March 17, 1972. Gonzales handed the crucial package to Morales who was waiting in the parking lot. Morales then proceeded to the motel room and, posing as Esquivel, gave the package to Lozano in exchange for $3,000 (Rec. Vol. II, pp. 146-148). An analysis of the package contents immediately after the sale revealed that Agent Lozano had purchased wheat, not heroin. The four defendants were quickly apprehended and charged with defrauding the government.</p>\n<p id=\"b1379-20\">\n<em>MORALES\u2019 CONVICTION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"A1hD\">The only direct evidence linking either appellant with the \u201cconspiracy\u201d to defraud the government was the accomplice testimony of Davila. Both a dope addict and convicted felon (Rec. Vol. II, p. 202), Davila had worked as an informer for the BNDD in the past (Rec. Vol. II, p. 34). He testified that Morales and Gonzales discussed with him the possibility of \u201cburning\u201d Agent Lozano,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> that Gonzales agreed to construct the fake heroin package,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and that both appellants knew Rudy Lozano\u2019s true identity.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> According to Davila, the $3,000 purchase price paid to Morales by Agent Lozano was to be split three ways \u2014one third for each appellant and one third for Davila.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1380-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1312\">*1312</page-number>In striking contrast to Davila\u2019s tale, Morales testified that he did not know that Lozano was an undercover agent or that the package was a sham (Rec. Vol. II, p. 267). He insisted that he would never have knowingly delivered the package to a government agent.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1380-4\">(A) <em>Davila\u2019s Testimony</em></p>\n<p id=\"AbSW\">In Tillery v. United States, 5 Cir. 1969, 411 F.2d 644, 647, this Court held that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1380-5\">\u201cIn determining whether there is substantial evidence in cases where a conviction rests upon the uncorroborated testimony of an accomplice, the general rule is that the uncorroborated testimony of an accomplice may support a conviction if it is not incredible or otherwise unsubstantial on its face [citing cases].\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1380-15\">Relying upon the rule in <em>Tillery, </em>coupled with the trial judge\u2019s characterization of Davila\u2019s testimony as \u201cinconceivable,\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Morales argues that the district court erred in allowing the jury to convict him on the strength of Davila\u2019s unsupported testimony.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1380-16\">Although Davila\u2019s testimony was both improbable and crucial to Morales\u2019 conviction, the principles enunciated in <em>Tillery, supra, </em>do not dictate a reversal here. <em>Tillery </em>is distinguishable from the instant case in two important respects.</p>\n<p id=\"b1380-17\">1) In <em>Tillery </em>the accomplice who uttered the damaging testimony had made earlier contradictory' statements about the crime. Thus, the testimony of the <em>Tillery </em>accomplice was both incredible and demonstrably unreliable.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> By con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1313\">*1313</page-number>trast, Davila\u2019s testimony, although dubious and at times ambiguous, was not rendered unreliable by any prior contradictory statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b1381-5\">2) However, a more important distinction can be drawn. In <em>Tillery, </em>the trial court permitted the jury to decide the defendant\u2019s guilt on the basis of accomplice Padgett\u2019s unsupported story \u201cwithout the benefit of an instruction that accomplice testimony should be received with caution and viewed with skepticism.\u201d (411 F.2d at 646.) Such an admonition was direly needed in <em>Tillery, </em>and the absence of a proper limiting charge was the key reason for reversal in that case.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1381-6\">In the present case, the trial judge clearly instructed the jury \u201cthat the testimony of an accomplice should be closely examined, received with caution and weighed with great care.\u201d <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> His charge correctly placed Davila\u2019s testimony under the harsh light required by <em>Tillery. </em>If, after viewing his testimony with a skeptical eye, the jury chose to believe Davila and base its verdict on his testimony alone, that was its prerogative. Diggs v. United States, 9 Cir. 1915, 220 F. 545, aff\u2019d, 242 U.S. 470, 37 S.Ct. 192, 61 L.Ed. 442; Lyles v. United States, 5 Cir. 1957, 249 F.2d 744; Williams v. United States, 8 Cir. 1964, 328 F.2d 256.</p>\n<p id=\"b1381-16\">Davila testified at trial that he was both a dope addict and a convicted felon (Rec. Vol. II, p. 202). That fact merited jury consideration, but did not, by itself, render Davila\u2019s testimony legally insubstantial.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1382-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1314\">*1314</page-number>B) <em>The BRUTON Rule Violation</em></p>\n<p id=\"A6C3\">During the course of the trial, two oral confessions attributed to Vargas and Gonzales respectively were admitted without objection by Morales.</p>\n<p id=\"b1382-4\">Gonzales\u2019 confession, uttered voluntarily after completion of the sale, was revealed by Agent Wood in the following exchange at trial:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1382-5\">\u201cA. Mr. Gonzales stated to himself and Agent Nattinger that he had been approached by Mr. Morales and Juan Davila to make a turkey package.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1382-6\">\u201cQ. Would you explain to the jury and to me please what a turkey package is?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1382-7\">\u201cA. A. turkey package is a dumb package. In this case it would be, it was the heroin \u2014 it would be a dumb package of heroin which was the flour.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1382-8\">\u201cQ. Did he tell you whether or not he was to receive anything for this?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1382-9\">\u201cA. Yes, sir. He did. He said Mr. Morales and Mr. Davila were going to give him a thousand dollars for it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1382-10\">(Rec. Vol. II, p. 168.) Gonzales\u2019 confession expressly charged Morales with knowledge that the package was fake, but not with knowledge of the agent\u2019s identity.</p>\n<p id=\"b1382-15\">Vargas\u2019 \u201cconfession\u201d consisted of the single, cryptic remark, \u201cYou have me in a conspiracy\u201d (Rec. Vol. II, p. 86). Because of its ambiguity, that statement does not carry the incriminating force of Gonzales\u2019 confession, and, by itself, constitutes an insignificant link between Morales and the fraud.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1382-16\">Morales contends that introduction of the confessions of Vargas and Gonzales, neither of whom testified at trial, violated his sixth amendment right to confrontation, recently delineated in Bruton v. United States, <em>supra. </em>We agree that admission of Gonzales\u2019 confession violated Morales\u2019 <em>Bruton </em>rights and, for that reason, reverse Morales\u2019 conviction.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1382-17\">In <em>Bruton </em>the Supreme Court held that introduction of the extrajudicial confession of one codefendant which inculpated another violated the latter\u2019s right to confrontation when the confessor chose not to testify. The <em>Bruton </em>Court openly rejected the rationale of Delli Paoli v. United States, 1956, 352 U.S. 232, 77 S.Ct. 294, 1 L.Ed.2d 278, that encroachment on the right - to confrontation could be avoided by an instruction to the jury to disregard the confessor\u2019s statement incriminating the nonconfessor in determining the nonconfessor\u2019s guilt.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Instead, the Court ruled that such an admonition is intrinsically ineffective and held that admis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1315\">*1315</page-number>sion of the codefendant\u2019s inculpatory statement was reversible error in spite of the trial court\u2019s cautionary charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b1383-5\">In the present ease, the trial judge instructed the jury to disregard Vargas\u2019 statement in determining the guilt of appellants. (Rec. Vol. II, pp. 377, 378.) Inexplicably, he did not make a similar charge with respect to the more damaging statement of Gonzales. It is clear, however, that even had the jury been warned to ignore Gonzales\u2019 statement in determining Morales\u2019 guilt, admission of that statement would have violated the <em>Bruton </em>rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b1383-6\">In two recent decisions, Harrington v. California, 1969, 395 U.S. 250, 89 S.Ct. 1726, 23 L.Ed.2d 284, and Schneble v.Florida, 1972, 405 U.S. 427, 92 S.Ct. 1056, 31 L.Ed.2d 340, the Supreme Court refused to overturn petitioner\u2019s conviction where a codefendant\u2019s confession was introduced at trial in violation of the <em>Bruton </em>rule, because the overwhelming evidence of petitioner\u2019s guilt rendered the <em>Bruton </em>violation \u201charmless error beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> While these decisions certainly confine the holding in <em>Bruton, </em>they do not dilute the admonition in Chapman v. California, 1967, 386 U.S. 18, 23, 87 S.Ct. 824, 17 L.Ed.2d 705, that constitutional errors affecting substantial rights cannot be considered harmless; and they are clearly inapplicable in a case such as this where the two extra-judicial statements constitute a significant portion of the evidence of guilt, supplemented only by the doubtful testimony of an accomplice.</p>\n<p id=\"b1383-13\">Morales did not object to the introduction of Gonzales\u2019 oral confession at trial. Thus, he cannot raise the issue of the <em>Bruton </em>violation for the first time on appeal, unless the introduction of Gonzales\u2019 confession constituted plain error. Rule 52(b), F.R.Crim.P. In view of the importance attached to the right to confrontation by recent Supreme Court decisions, we hold that the denial of that right in this case was plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b1383-14\">Rule 52(b), F.R.Crim.P., states that, \u201cPlain errors or defects affecting substantial rights may be noticed although they were not brought to the attention of the court.\u201d Although several different definitions of \u201cplain error\u201d have been fashioned by the courts,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> the ultimate decision whether or not to take notice of an error not raised below must depend on the facts of the particular case. Dupoint v. United States, 5 Cir. 1968, 388 F.2d 39, 45; Sykes v. United States, 5 Cir. 1966, 373 F.2d 607, cert. denied, 386 U.S. 977, 87 S.Ct. 1172, 18 L.Ed.2d 138.</p>\n<p id=\"b1383-15\">The Supreme Court has not had occasion to decide whether a <em>Bruton </em>viola<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1316\">*1316</page-number>tion constitutes plain error, but the language used in the <em>Bruton </em>line of cases demonstrates the Court\u2019s strong commitment to correcting the \u201cserious flaw\u201d created by admission of a Bruton-type confession. In <em>Bruton, supra, </em>391 U.S. at 137, 88 S.Ct. at 1628, the Supreme Court observed that \u201cthe introduction of Evans\u2019 confession posed a <em>substantial threat </em>to petitioner\u2019s right to confront the witnesses against him\u201d [emphasis added], and the Court reiterated the importance of that right when it held the <em>Bruton </em>rule retroactive in Roberts v. Russell, 1968, 392 U.S. 293, 88 S.Ct. 1921, 20 L.Ed.2d 1100, stating that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1384-4\">\u201cDespite the cautionary instruction, the admission of a defendant\u2019s confession which implicates a codefendant results in such <em>a \u2018serious flaw.\u2019 </em>The retroactivity of the holding in <em>Bruton </em>is therefore required; the error <em>\u2018went to the basis of fair hearing </em>and trial because the procedural apparatus never assured the [petitioner] a fair determination\u2019 of his guilt or innocence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1384-5\">(Emphasis added.) (392 U.S. at 294, 88 S.Ct. at 1922).<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1384-6\">In view of the importance accorded the <em>Bruton </em>rule by the Supreme Court, coupled with the fact that Gonzales\u2019 confession represents one of the chief links between Morales and the fraud, we hold that introduction of Gonzales\u2019 confession seriously impaired Morales\u2019 right to a fair trial and, therefore, was plain error.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1384-10\">\n<em>GONZALES\u2019 CONVICTION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1384-11\">A) <em>The Accomplice Testimony</em></p>\n<p id=\"A3p\">Gonzales, like Morales, contests the propriety of allowing the jury to convict on the uncorroborated testimony of Davila. For the reasons expressed previously, we believe the trial court properly followed the procedure set out in <em>Tillery, supra, </em>obviating any argument that Davila\u2019s testimony was erroneously submitted to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b1384-13\">B) <em>Application of the BRUTON Rule</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1384-14\">In his brief on appeal, Gonzales duplicates Morales\u2019 argument and claims that both his own confession and that of Vargas were introduced in violation of the <em>Bruton </em>rule. However, Gonzales has no standing to attack the introduction of his own confession on <em>Bruton </em>grounds.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> The rule enunciated in <em>Bruton </em>stems from the right to confrontation and is designed to protect the nontestifying confessor\u2019s codefendant, not the confessor himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b1384-15\">Of course, Gonzales does have standing to question the' introduction of Vargas\u2019 statement on <em>Bruton </em>grounds. But Gonzales did not object to the admission of Vargas\u2019 statement at trial, and that statement added very little weight to the government\u2019s case against Gonzales.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> For that reason, we hold that introduction of Vargas\u2019 statement which, unlike that of Gonzales, only tenuously connected appellants with the crime, did not constitute a sufficiently <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1317\">*1317</page-number>serious flaw to rise to the level of plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b1385-5\">C) <em>Entrapment</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1385-6\">Gonzales raises the additional defense of entrapment. A careful study of the record indicates that Davila might have tricked his compatriots, but the facts do not suggest entrapment. No government official implanted in Gonzales\u2019 mind the disposition to commit this crime. Sherman v. United States, 1958, 356 U.S. 369, 78 S.Ct. 819, 2 L.Ed.2d 848; Sorrells v. United States, 1932, 287 U.S. 435, 53 S.Ct. 210, 77 L. Ed. 413; 73 Harv.L.Rev. 1333 (1960). Nor does the factual pattern of this sale indicate impermissibly vigorous government involvement sufficient to constitute entrapment as a matter of law. United States v. Bueno, 5 Cir. 1971, 447 F.2d 903.</p>\n<p id=\"b1385-7\">Accordingly, the judgment of conviction of Gonzales is affirmed, while the judgment of conviction of Morales is reversed, and the case as against Morales is remanded for another trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1385-8\">Affirmed as to Gonzales; reversed and remanded as to Morales.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1378-11\">. The indictment contained one count and charged six overt acts in furtherance of a conspiracy punishable under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1379-7\">. One of the discussions supposedly took place at the Comet Drive-In, as revealed by the following colloquy :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1379-8\">\u201cQ. What happened after you got there [Comet Drive-In] ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1379-9\">\u201cA. Joe [Morales] went and called Iludy [Gonzales] and Rudy crossed the street and started talking to Joe. Then I got into the conversation with them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1379-10\">\u201cQ. What were they talking about?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1379-11\">\u201cA. About Rudy Lozano there.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1379-12\">\u201cQ.

Vol. II, pp. 189-190.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1379-17\">. Davila stated, at p. 190 of the Record, Vol. II:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1379-18\">\u201cWell, that was going to be left up to Rudy Gonzales. He was going to fix that package up. AA\u2019e didn\u2019t know what was going to be in the package. AVe just knew it was going to be some kind of powder to where it looked like heroin.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1379-22\">. When pressed on cross-examination about his earlier, equivocal assertion that Rudy Gonzales \u201cknew more or less\u201d that Lozano was an undercover agent, Davila replied: \u201cWell, \u2018more or less\u2019 is the same thing, like knowing; to me, it is.\u201d (Rec. Vol. II, p. 212.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1379-24\">. After the sale, Morales was apprehended with $950 of the marked money on his person. This fact supports Davila\u2019s assertion that the profits were to be evenly divided and belies Morales\u2019 claim that lie was participating in the transaction as a favor to Davila, expecting only a fix and a little money for his efforts. (Rec. Vol. II, pp. 255, 256.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1379-26\">However, Morales claimed that he was merely holding the money for Davila (Rec. Vol. II, p. 258), and in any event the ultimate disposition of the $3,000 does not directly bear on the critical issue \u2014 the extent of Morales\u2019 involvement in the plot to defraud.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1380-6\">. Morales parried repeated leading questions by government counsel designed to elicit an admission, arguing quite logically that, in his view, delivery of either heroin or nonheroin to a government agent while under surveillance would be suicide.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1380-7\">. At one point during the trial, outside the presence of the jury, the trial judge openly expressed his disbelief in Davila\u2019s story:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1380-8\">\u201cI just can\u2019t see, to save my life, why any people who are just reasonably intelligent would conspire to take money from a federal agent, that it is just so impossible and improbable and inconceivable to me that I just can\u2019t \u2014 I just can\u2019t visualize it in my mind.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1380-9\">Rec. Vol. II, p. 316.</p>\n<p id=\"b1380-10\">Later at the sentencing proceedings after trial, the trial judge reiterated his incredulity:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1380-11\">\u201cI want to clarify my position. I still think it is a truth \u2014 is\u2014stranger-than-fiction type of story. I was not the fact-finder. I wasn\u2019t passing upon the credibility of either of the two witnesses [Davila or Morales]. I was just saying that probably what Mr. Morales said to the effect that there was no way in which he would have done what he was accused of having done, that this would comport more with my idea of what tlie situation might have been, but I didn\u2019t want to, impliedly or otherwise, indicate that I was taking away from the jury the fact finding job.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1380-12\">Rec. Vol. II, p. 398.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b1380-13\">. Although the government contends that Davila\u2019s testimony was buttressed by the extrajudicial confessions of Gonzales and Vargas, Gonzales\u2019 confession was improperly admitted (see discussion of <em>Bruton </em>rule, infra), and Vargas\u2019 \u201cconfession\u201d was too ambiguous to represent any more than a weak implication that appellants knew of tlie plot to defraud. Hence, Davila\u2019s testimony stands alone as evidence of appellants\u2019 guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b1380-19\">At page 11 of its brief, the government argues that \u201cthere was strong corroboration of the accomplice\u2019s testimony, provided by several narcotics agents who had witnessed tlie events outside the motel and bad participated in the arrests.\u201d This statement misses tlie point. Appellants admit participation in the sale; they only deny knowledge of the fraud. The eyewitness testimony of the agents to which the government brief refers merely places the appellants at the scene of the crime; it does not establish their awareness of the plot to deceive \u2014 a necessary element of the crime for which they are charged.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b1380-20\">. Prior to his testimony at trial in <em>Tillery, </em>the accomplice, Padgett, had given four different, contradictory statements regarding the burglary.

Recognizing the crucial importance of a limiting charge, the <em>Tillery </em>court observed that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1381-8\">\u201cby failing to warn the jury about Padgett\u2019s reliability in this case, the trial court presented the evidence to the jury in an improper perspective, and the jury may have felt bound to accept it as true.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1381-9\">411 F.2d at 648. The best indication that the <em>Tillery </em>court considered omission of an admonishing charge decisive was its holding that such failure was plain error (411 F.2d at 648).</p>\n<p id=\"b1381-10\">In the earlier case of Williamson v. United States, 5 Cir. 1964, 332 F.2d 123, this Court established the rule followed in <em>Tillery </em>that failure to admonish the jury to narrowly scrutinize the testimony of an accomplice is plain error.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b1381-11\">. The entire charge to the jury on accomplice testimony consisted of the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1381-12\">\u201cAll evidence from a witness whose self-interest or attitude is shown to be such as might tend to prompt testimony unfavorable to an accused should be considered with caution and weighed with great care.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1381-13\">\u201cIn this case one of the defendants, I previously told you, has entered a guilty plea and has testified. lie would fall under what we call the category of an accomplice. He was one who admittedly was involved in this affair, this offense. So, I charge you that an accomplice is one who voluntarily and with common intent participates with another person in the commission or planning of a crime. An accomplice does not become incompetent as a witness because of participation in the criminal act charged. On the contrary, the testimony of an accomplice alone, if believed by the jury, may be of such weight to sustain a verdict of'guilty even though not corroborated or supported by other evidence. However, the jury should keep in mind that the testimony of an accomplice should be closely examined, received with caution, and weighed with great care.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1381-18\">\u201cOn the other hand, if the jury believes the testimony of an accomplice to be true beyond a reasonable doubt, that testimony is sufficient to convict a defendant even though it is not corroborated by any other evidence. The jury should not convict a defendant upon the unsupported testimony of an accomplice unless it believes the unsupported testimony beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1381-19\">Rec. Vol. II, pp. 370-71.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b1381-20\">. In Williams v. United States, <em>supra, </em>p. 259, the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1381-21\">\u201cMiss Walker could be regarded as an accomplice in the commission of the offenses involved; she was a user of narcotics; she had a previous felony conviction for narcotic possession; and apparently the Government chose not to prosecute her in the present situation. These were matters which might influence her testimony. They would not, however, of themselves <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1314\">*1314</page-number>make her testimony so legally unsubstantial or lier credibility as a witness so legally infirm as to require reasonable doubt to be recognized as a matter of law.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1382-12\">In the present case, the trial judge\u2019s cautionary instructions to the jury on accomplice testimony adequately protected the defendants by subjecting Davila\u2019s testimony to close scrutiny.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b1382-13\">. Vargas\u2019 confession is ambiguous because it could mean several different things: that Vargas was caught in a conspiracy to sell heroin, that he was caught in a conspiracy to defraud a nongovernmental agent, or that he was caught in a plot to defraud the government. In addition, the term \u201cconspiracy\u201d might refer to a combination of only two persons or to individuals entirely distinct from appellants. In other words, Vargas\u2019 \u201cconfession\u201d does not directly inculpate anyone.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b1382-19\">. Improper admission of Gonzales\u2019 confession in itself requires reversal of Morales\u2019 conviction. Thus, the prejudicial effect of Vargas\u2019 statement on the jury\u2019s determination of Morales\u2019 guilt is academic.</p>\n<p id=\"b1382-20\">However, the admissibility of Vargas\u2019 statement is important with respect to Gonzales\u2019 conviction, because (for reasons to be explained subsequently) Gonzales had no standing to attack the admission of his own confession on <em>Bruton </em>grounds.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b1382-21\">.

In both cases, ample evidence was available to demonstrate petitioner\u2019s guilt without reliance upon his codefendant\u2019s confession. In Harrington v.
