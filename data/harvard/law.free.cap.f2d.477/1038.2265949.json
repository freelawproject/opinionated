Seibert, alleged in Count II of their complaint<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> filed against Edwin L. Wiegand Company (Wiegand) that Wiegand refused to employ them in its factory because they were married women, thereby discriminating against them on the basis of sex in violation of Title YII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S. C. \u00a7 2000e-2(a)(1)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Jurisdiction is based on 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(f) and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1343(3) and 1331(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b1108-19\">The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission found probable cause to believe that Wiegand had engaged in a discriminatory employment practice but could not mediate the matter.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> On February 14, 1969, Wiegand offered employment to Mrs. Jurinko and Mrs. Siebert, but on the advice of a representative of EEOC both rejected the offer. This action was instituted on February 28, 1969, and after trial to the court, Judge Teitelbaum found that Wiegand had no general policy of discriminating against married women, but he did find that Mrs. Jurinko and Mrs. Siebert were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1041\">*1041</page-number>discriminated against and that such discrimination was not based on a \u201cbona fide occupational qualification.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Judgment was entered in the plaintiffs\u2019 favor awarding them $15,784 representing back wages, together with an award of an additional sum in the amount of $3,946 for attorney fees. Judge Teitelbaum also directed Wiegand to offer Mrs. Jurinko and Mrs. Siebert employment \u201cat the next nearest opportunity.\u201d <footnotemark>5</footnotemark>,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1109-5\">Wiegand appealed the court\u2019s judgment at our No. 72-1044, asserting (1) that the plaintiffs\u2019 claims are barred because charges were not filed with the Commission within 90 days of the occurrence of the alleged unlawful employment practice as required by 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(d), (2) that the evidence does not support the district court\u2019s conclusion that the plaintiffs were discriminated against on account of their marital status, (3) that if there was such discrimination, it was based on a \u201cbona fide occupational qualification\u201d which the plaintiffs did not satisfy, and (4) that the damages awarded plaintiff Siebert were excessive. The plaintiffs have appealed at our No. 72-1043 insofar as the judgment holds that Wiegand\u2019s general hiring policy for production department jobs did not discriminate against married women and insofar as it denied recovery of back pay after Feb. 14, 1969, and held that plaintiffs\u2019 reinstatement should be as new employees without seniority. It should be noted that the plaintiffs have not appealed from the failure of the district court to treat this suit as a class action under Rule 23, F. R.Civ.P., 28 U.S.C.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> A pre-trial stipulation was entered into by the parties and filed, and reference will be made to it from time to time. The material facts are substantially uncontested, and as Judge Teitelbaum stated: \u201c[I]t is the inferences to be drawn or not to be drawn from the facts that are the core of the controversy.\u201d 331 F.Supp. at 1185.</p>\n<p id=\"b1109-7\">According to the stipulation the plaintiffs were employees of Wiegand for a number of years prior to December 10, 1953; that at that time both were discharged from employment because of their respective marriages; that Wiegand\u2019s policy of discharging women upon their marriages and of not hiring married women was instituted at the close of World War II for the purpose of providing jobs for \u201cbread winners\u201d returning after the war and that this policy was lawful at least until July 2, 1965, the effective date of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. In July, 1965, the plaintiffs approached Wiegand\u2019s Personnel Director and requested that they be reinstated in their former jobs. The Personnel Director refused this request, stating they were not entitled to reinstatement and in any event the company was not then hiring employees. Thereafter, on September 7, 1965, Mrs. Jurinko submitted a written application for employment with Wiegand, and Mrs. Seibert submitted a similar request to Wiegand on January 10, 1966. At this time, both plaintiffs were informed that the company was not then hiring any employees but that their applications would be kept on file for future reference. In June, 1966, the plaintiffs again contacted the Personnel Director seeking <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1042\">*1042</page-number>employment and were again informed that Wiegand was not hiring at that time. The plaintiffs filed a charge of discrimination against Wiegand with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission on July 29, 1966.</p>\n<p id=\"b1110-4\">The district court stated as follows in respect to the contention of Wiegand that the charges were not timely filed: \u201cThe company contends that because the charge was filed with the Commission more than 90 days after the original meeting in June of 1965, it was untimely, and therefore this Court lacks jurisdiction of this action. Section 2000e-5(d) of 42 U.S.C. does provide that charges with the Commission shall be filed within 90 days of the occurrence of the alleged unlawful employment practice. It is clear, however, that the plaintiffs\u2019 reapplication in June of 1966 represents the occurrence of an alleged unlawful employment practice, and consequently this Court is not without jurisdiction. See Cox v. United States Gypsum Co., 409 F.2d 289 (C.A. 7, 1969).\u201d 331 F.Supp. at 1186, n. 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b1110-5\">We are in agreement with the district court\u2019s conclusion, for there were three separate and distinct acts, the latter of which occurred within the 90-day period. Therefore the 90-day statutory period commenced to run anew from the last allegedly unlawful employment practice. Molybdenum Corp. of America v. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, 457 F.2d 935 (10 Cir. 1972). The ground raised by Wiegand, that the plaintiffs\u2019 failed to timely pursue their administrative remedy, is thus without merit.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1110-6\">Turning to the contentions in the matter of the district court\u2019s conclusions regarding discrimination, the statistical evidence and the attitude of Wiegand\u2019s personnel directors are well set out in Judge Teitelbaum\u2019s opinion, 331 F.Supp. at 1186, as follows: \u201cStatistically, the evidence is that (1) at all relevant times the company employed, in production, approximately 900 persons; (2) of these approximately 900 persons, 59 were women on July 2, 1965, 58 on May 15, 1966, 56 on December 31, 1966, and 44 on March 1, 1971; (3) at all relevant times, of the women employed only three were married; (4) at all relevant times, only two married women, other than the plaintiffs, applied for employment in production [It must be noted in this regard that both of these women were hired in January of 1969, after the Commission had notified the plaintiffs of their right to sue Wiegand under the Civil Rights Act.]; and (5) during the period from May 15, 1966 to December 31, 1966, forty-three new employees were hired, all of whom were males. There is no evidence of the qualifications of the forty-three males hired. There is evidence, however, that the plaintiffs\u2019 applications were on file during the period from May 15 to December 31, 1966, that the company was aware of their applications, and that prior experience and a good work record with the company (which each plaintiff had) were qualifications which favored an applicant. Asked why the plaintiffs had not been hired during that period, the then Personnel Director testified that he \u2018 * * * really [didn\u2019t] know * *- * \u2019 but that it \u2018 * * * could [have been] many reasons * * *.\u2019 A later Personnel Director testified that the company\u2019s practice of permitting \u2018bumping\u2019 (by seniority) for each new job opening in production made it mandatory that new employees be physically able to perform each and every job in production (since the new employees were ultimately \u2018bumped\u2019 to the most physically taxing jobs) and that the assumption under which the company operated was that women were physically unable to perform each and every production job. In conclusion, both Personnel Directors testified that the company had not pursued a policy of discrimination against married women.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1110-10\">On the basis of the above facts, the court concluded: \u201cWe do not think how<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1043\">*1043</page-number>ever, that the statistical evidence introduced in this case reasonably supports a conclusion that the company\u2019s general hiring policy discriminated against married women. The low number of married women employees of the company must be considered in light of the company\u2019s pre-Civil Rights Act policy and the number of married women who have applied for employment since the termination of that policy. The uncontradicted testimony is that from 1965 through 1968, the plaintiffs were the only married women who applied to the company for work in production. Two others apparently applied in early 1969 and both were offered employment. A general policy of discriminatory hiring cannot logically be concluded. With specific regard to the plaintiffs, however, the evidence of the company\u2019s extensive hiring of men during a period when the plaintiffs, with prior experience and good work records, were actively seeking employment from the company, we think is sufficient to support, if only preponderantly, an unexplained inference of discrimination.\u201d 331 F.Supp. at 1187.</p>\n<p id=\"b1111-4\">The record shows that if Wiegand did change its prior policy of not employing married women in the production department<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> it kept remarkably silent about it. Its Personnel Director, Bushnell, did state to the union on a form supplied by the Government that the company was obeying the Civil Rights Act of 1964, but Bushnell did not tell the union that the company was \u201cgoing to be hiring married women from here on in.\u201d Such forms were posted on the bulletin boards, but again, Bushnell never posted any notices that female employees in the production department would no longer be discharged upon marriage. Nevertheless, we cannot say that the district court\u2019s conclusion that no general discriminatory hiring policy existed was unwarranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b1111-9\">Nor was the evidence insufficient to support the finding of a violation of Title VII as to these particular plaintiffs. The evidence, especially the fact that during the six month period following the plaintiffs\u2019 application (and when the plaintiffs were told that the company was not then hiring), 43 new male employees were hired despite the facts of plaintiffs\u2019 prior experience and good work records with the company, does support an inference of discrimination as the district court found. Plaintiffs made out a prima facie case of unlawful discrimination, thereby shifting the onus of going forward with evidence to Wiegand. As was said in Hodgson v. First Federal Savings and Loan Association of Broward County, Florida, 455 F. 2d 818, 822 (5 Cir. 1972), \u201cIn discrimination cases the law with respect to burden of proof is well settled. The plaintiff is required to make out a prima facie case of unlawful discrimination at which point the burden shifts to the defendant to justify the existence of any disparities. See, e.g., Norris v. Alabama, 294 U.S. 587, 55 S.Ct. 579, 79 L.Ed. 1074 (1935); Muniz v. Beto, 434 F.2d 697 (CA 5, 1970); Weeks v. Southern Bell Telephone and Telegraph Company, 408 F.2d 228 (CA 5, 1969); Gates v. Georgia-Pacific Corporation, 326 F.Supp. 397 (D.C.D.Or.1970). Once the plaintiff has made out his prima facie case we look to the defendant for an explanation since he is in a position to know whether he failed <em>to hire </em>a person for reasons which would exonerate him.\u201d See also United States v. Hayes International Corporation, 456 F.2d 112 (5 Cir. 1971). In the case at bar, Wiegand was unable to offer any explanation for its having filled its 43 job vacancies solely with men to the exclusion of the plaintiffs,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and it failed to rebut the inference, <em>i.e., </em>prima facie case, of discrimination. That the plaintiffs may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1044\">*1044</page-number>not have been physically qualified to perform all jobs in the factory<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> is not relevant to this issue, for the company did not determine this while plaintiffs\u2019 applications were pending nor did it assert this as a reason for not hiring the plaintiffs.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Nor are the two conclusions concerning the absence of a general policy of discrimination but the presence of discrimination against these plaintiffs inconsistent.</p>\n<p id=\"b1112-4\">Wiegand originally took the position that discrimination against married females was not discrimination \u201con the basis of sex within the meaning of the Act.\u201d This position was, of course, dropped in the light of Phillips v. Martin Marietta Corp., 400 U.S. 542, 91 S.Ct. 496, 27 L.Ed.2d 613 (1971). In the <em>Phillips </em>case the Supreme Court made it clear that under Title VII of the Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-2, an employer may not refuse to hire women with preschool age children while hiring men with such children. The facts of the <em>Phillips </em>case are somewhat different from those of the ease at bar but the analogy between <em>Phillips </em>and the instant case is plain. Employment practices which vary in their applicability to married females and married males constitute discrimination on the basis of sex, the only distinguishing characteristic being the sex of the married persons. A different standard is clearly applied to men than to women. See Sprogis v. United Air Lines, Inc., 444 F.2d 1194 (7 Cir.1971), cert. denied 404 U.S. 991, 92 S.Ct. 536, 30 L.Ed.2d 543 (1971). Wiegand now argues, however, that the plaintiffs failed to prove discrimination on the basis of sex since no showing was made as to whether the men hired while the plaintiffs\u2019 applications were pending were married. Wiegand\u2019s point is well taken, and we agree that the plaintiffs did not make out a case of sex discrimination based on their status as married women. Discrimination against married women constitutes discrimination on the basis of sex only if a different standard, <em>i. e., </em>the marital status of the person, has been applied to men and women. Absent proof of the standard applied to men, obviously the plaintiffs have not established that such standard differs from the one applied to women.</p>\n<p id=\"b1112-10\">Although the judgment therefore cannot stand on the theory that the plaintiffs were discriminated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1045\">*1045</page-number>against because they were <em>married </em>women, nevertheless, as discussed above, the evidence is sufficient to support the judgment on the theory that the plaintiffs were discriminated against because of their status as <em>women. We </em>recognize that the latter theory was not overtly an issue in the case, for the complaint alleged discrimination against married women<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> and discrimination against women as such was not included in the list of contested issues contained in the pre-trial stipulation.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> An appellate court, however, may uphold a judgment on any theory which finds support in the record<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> and may affirm the decision of a lower court if the result is correct \u201calthough the lower court relied upon a wrong ground or gave a wrong reason.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Under Rule 15(b), F.R.Civ.P., 28 U.S.C., a liberal provision is made for amendments to conform the pleadings to the evidence, and this court may consider issues so raised even though no formal application is made to amend. See Underwriters Salvage Co. of New York v. Davis and Shaw Furniture Co., 198 F.2d 450, 453 (10 Cir.1952). \u201cThe fact that this involves a change in the . legal theory of the action, is immaterial so long as the opposing party has not been prejudiced in presenting his case.\u201d <footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Nor do we think that the pretrial stipulation prevents this court from applying proper legal principles to the facts disclosed by the proof.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> The same considerations which govern under Rule 15(b) should also control the determination of whether a different theory is foreclosed by the stipulation, that is whether the defendant would be prejudiced, <em>i. e., </em>whether it had a fair opportunity to defend and whether it could <em>offer </em>any additional evidence on the different theory.</p>\n<p id=\"b1113-15\">In the case at bar, we see no way in which Wiegand\u2019s presentation of its case could have been prejudiced. There is no dispute as to the essential facts, only the inferences therefrom. Wiegand had full opportunity to justify its failure to hire the plaintiffs. Moreover, the company\u2019s main line of defense to the plaintiffs\u2019 alleged theory of discrimination against them on account of their status as <em>married </em>women was that women as a class were physically unable to perform each and every production job. See note 11, <em>supra, </em>for an explana<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1046\">*1046</page-number>tion of the company\u2019s policy which it contended set up the so-called \u201cbona fide occupational qualification.\u201d This defense is irrelevant to the issue of discrimination against women on account of their marital status, but it is relevant to the theory now being considered, discrimination against women as a class and the plaintiffs as members of this class. We therefore hold that the conclusion of the district court that the plaintiffs were discriminated against must be affirmed, albeit on a different theory than that relied upon below.</p>\n<p id=\"b1114-4\">As to damages, the district judge stated: \u201cDamages are computed as follows. The parties have stipulated that if the plaintiffs had been employed by the company for the years 1966, 1967 and 1968, Mrs. Jurinko and Mrs. Seibert would have earned $5,127.00, $5,855.00 and $5,959.00, and $5,099.00, $5,855.00 and $5,959.00, respectively. For the period from July of 1966 to February of 1969, Mrs. Jurinko would have earned a total of approximately $14,377.00 and Mrs. Seibert would have earned a total of approximately $14,363.00. In assessing back pay, however, \u00a7 706(g) of the Civil Rights Act requires that, \u2018 * * [I]nterim earnings or amounts earnable with reasonable diligence by * * * persons discriminated against shall operate to reduce the back pay otherwise allocable.\u2019 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(g). The parties have also stipulated that during the period from July of 1966 to February of 1969 Mrs. Jurinko, working elsewhere, made a total of $6,478.00. Reducing $14,377.00 by $6,478.00 results in damages in the amount of $7,899.00 to Mrs. Jurinko. Mrs. Seibert, on the other hand, did not work during this period. While she testified that she undertook some efforts to obtain other employment, we think that Mrs. Jurinko\u2019s successful efforts are a more accurate measure of \u2018amounts earnable with reasonable diligence.\u2019 The amount of Mrs. Seibert\u2019s damages, then, are $14,363.00 less $6,478.00, or $7,885.00. In addition, the plaintiffs are to be offered employment in production with the company, of course, as new employees. An appropriate Order will be entered.\u201d 331 F.Supp. at 1188.</p>\n<p id=\"b1114-12\">Section 706(g) of Title VII, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(g), authorizes appropriate judicial relief from unlawful discriminatory practices.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> \u201cThis grant of authority should be broadly read and applied so as to effectively terminate the practice and make its victims whole,\u201d Bowe v. Colgate Palmolive Company, 416 F.2d 711, 721 (7 Cir. 1969), and we believe that courts have a duty to grant relief which so far as possible eliminates the discriminatory effects of the past as well as bars like discrimination in the future. Louisiana v. United States, 380 U.S. 145, 154, 85 S.Ct. 817, 13 L.Ed.2d 709 (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b1114-13\">We can perceive no basis for the trial court to have refused to award back seniority or for its conclusion that \u201cthe plaintiffs are to be offered employment in production with the company, of course, as new employees.\u201d Seniority is, of course, of great importance to production workers for it determines both opportunities for job advancement and the order of layoff in the case of a reduction in a company\u2019s operating forces. It is our view that the plaintiffs are entitled to seniority and back pay dating from the time of the discriminatory employment practice up to the time they are actually reinstated. Only in this way will the present effects of the past discrimination be eliminated.</p>\n<p id=\"b1115-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1047\">*1047</page-number>The trial court refused to accept this view, having found that the \u201cdiscrimination ceased in February of 1969 when the company finally offered the plaintiffs employment,\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> for the \u201crejection of the offers was not within the control of the company and should not work to its disadvantage.\u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> We cannot agree with this position. The terms of the 1969 job offers were within Wiegand\u2019s control, and it did not offer the plaintiffs back seniority or back pay. The offer that was made did not rectify the effects of its past discrimination, and the plaintiffs were under no duty to accept such an offer. See Sprogis v. United Air Lines, <em>supra. </em>Even though the discrimination ceased with the job offers, as the district court found, the effects of such discrimination did not cease. Under the circumstances of this case, it is the latter which is the more significant factor in formulating an appropriate remedy. While it is true that acceptance of these job offers would have mitigated damages,<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> plaintiffs did not act unreasonably in refusing the offers. Thus \u201camounts earnable with reasonable diligence\u201d can not be equated with a compulsion to accept Wiegand\u2019s offer, but rather, must be determined as to post February, 1969 earnings by the district court on remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b1115-5\">Lastly, we do not think that the damages awarded to Seibert were excessive. The district court properly reduced the amount of damages awarded her by an amount it considered \u201cearnable with reasonable diligence,\u201d and we do not think the award, so reduced, constituted an abuse of discretion. See Local 53 of International Association of Heat and Frost Insulators and Asbestos Workers v. Vogler, 407 F.2d 1047, 1052 (5 Cir. 1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b1115-12\">The district court is directed to modify its judgment to expand the award to the plaintiffs to include seniority and back pay from the date of the unlawful employment practice in June, 1966, up to the date on which they are actually reinstated.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> In all other respects, the judgment will be affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1108-8\">.

Accordingly, this action is not properly maintainable as a class action and will not be treated as one.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b1110-11\">. Pursuit of the administrative remedy is a prerequisite to a suit such as that at bar.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b1111-5\">. The production department is what we are concerned with; there has been no suggestion of discrimination against married women in Wiegand\u2019s clerical force.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b1111-10\">. For example, the Personnel Director at the time plaintiffs\u2019 applications were on file testified that he \u201creally [didn\u2019t] know . . .\u201d why plaintiffs had not been hired.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b1112-5\">. Due to plant wide seniority provisions in Wiegand\u2019s labor agreement, job vacancies were bid on by the existing labor force with the result that new employees were often \u201cbumped\u201d to the most physically taxing jobs in production. Wiegand therefore had a policy requiring that new employees be physically able to perform each job in production.</p>\n<p id=\"b1112-6\">This policy cannot provide the basis for a \u201cbona fide occupational qualification.\u201d It is clear that Wiegand proceeded on the assumption that women as a class were physically unable to perform each and every job in production, but as Judge Teitelbaum pointed out in his thorough and thoughtful opinion, 331 F.Supp. at <em>1187-1188: \u201cIn </em>Ridinger v. General Motors Corp., 325 F.Supp. 1089 (D.C.S.D.Ohio, 1971), the Court decided that, \u2018[A] bona fide occupational qualification is not established by an assumption or \u201cstereotyped characterization\u201d that very few women could perform a particular job.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b1112-8\">\u201cTo establish a \u2018bona fide occupational qualification,\u2019 the Court held, requires reference to individual capacities of individual women. See Weeks v. Southern Bell Telephone and Telegraph Co., 408 F.2d 228 (C.A. 5, 1969) and Richards v. Griffith Rubber Mills, 300 F.Supp. 338 (D.C.Or., 1969). Wiegand\u2019s assumption, therefore, falls short of establishing an acceptable qualification, and its discriminatory employment practices regarding the plaintiffs are thus rendered legally indefensible.\u201d (Notes omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1112-12\">We agree with the district court\u2019s conclusions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b1112-13\">. Contrary to the company\u2019s argument, the plaintiffs did not have the burden of proving that they were so qualified in making their prima facie case of discrimination. Rather, we think that once plaintiffs have made a prima facie showing of discrimination it was incumbent upon the company to prove that the plaintiffs were not qualified in justification of its failure to hire them.

By its own admission and evidence, Wiegand discriminated against women by employing a sterotyped characterization that women were physically unqualified for the jobs the plaintiffs had applied for. See note 11, <em>supra. </em>See F.R.Civ.P. 15(b) and 16. Rule 16 should be read in light of Rule 15(b).

The back pay, of course, must be reduced by the amounts which the district court found to be \u201cinterim earnings or amounts earnable with reasonable diligence.\u201d Since such amounts pertained to pre-February, 1969 earnings, the post February, 1969 back pay to be awarded must be similarly reduced.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b1115-13\">GIBBONS, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"ApO\">(concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b1115-14\">I agree with the analysis of the issues in this case set forth in Judge Biggs\u2019 opinion with one exception which in no way affects the outcome. It seems to me that the admitted policy of discrimination against married women, which antedated the enactment of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-2 and which never operated against married men, together with the evidence establishing that a discriminatory policy continued to operate against the appellants who are married women after the passage of the Act, sufficiently establish that these married women were discriminated against on the basis of their sex. Thus, I do not agree that we must decide the cases on a theory different from that relied on by the district court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
