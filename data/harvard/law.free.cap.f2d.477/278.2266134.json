The district court\u2019s judgment dismissing appellant\u2019s complaint is therefore affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-26\">In view of the statement of facts contained in the majority and dissenting panel opinions it is necessary to set forth only brief facts in this opinion. On April 7, 1968, Scarpa entered a plea of guilty in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York to one count of a four count indictment, charging him with forging endorsements and uttering stolen United States Savings Bonds in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 495. The trial court imposed the maximum sentence of eight years, however, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4208(a) (2),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the judgment provided that Scarpa would be eligible for parole at any time after his incarceration.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b347-27\">At the time of his federal conviction, appellant was confined in a New York state prison serving a sentence for attempted robbery and attempted grand larceny.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Having completed his state sentence, Scarpa commenced serving his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>sentence in the United States Penitentiary in Atlanta on July 8, 1969. Approximately three months later, on October 13, 1969, he received his initial hearing before a commissioner of the United States Board of Parole (hereinafter the Board). The Board, after considering the application, denied parole. He subsequently instituted the present action for declaratory relief.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> He based his claim for relief on the internal procedures and practices of the Board which he asserted denied him due process of law. He further urged that the Board did not follow the applicable regulations which govern its internal procedures because it did not fully investigate all the information he submitted in his application for parole.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b348-4\">The district court denied relief without a hearing. Recognizing the importance of <em>\u201ca </em>full, fair hearing and consideration prior to a parole decision,\u201d the court concluded that Scarpa\u2019s complaint did not reveal such deprivations. Additionally, the court held that it was not improper for the Board to place controlling emphasis on Scarpa\u2019s previous criminal record in denying parole. Ultimately, the district court\u2019s judgment was reversed by a divided panel of this court.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b348-12\">Assuming, as we must,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> that the allegations in Scarpa\u2019s complaint are true, the precise issue presented by this appeal is whether he has stated a cause of action upon which a federal court may grant relief. A peripheral issue, and one which is necessarily intertwined with his factual allegations, is whether the ingredients of procedural due process sought by Scarpa are necessary to bring the Board\u2019s procedures within minimal constitutional standards. Before reviewing the precise issues of the instant appeal, we feel that a brief review of the applicable law in this area is helpful.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-13\">The Board is an independent statutory agency which is granted broad discretionary powers in parole eligibility determinations.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> We have previously held that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-14\">By the language of Title 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 4203, the Board of Parole is given absolute discretion in matters of parole. The courts are without power to grant a parole or to determine judicially eligibility for parole. United States v. Frederick, 405 F.2d 129 (3d Cir. 1968). Furthermore, it is not the function of the courts to review the discretion of the Board in the denial of the application for parole or to re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>view the credibility of reports and information received by the Board in making its determination.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"AL_\">The decision whether to grant parole is a very complicated one.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">Many factors are necessarily involved in such determinations. The Board\u2019s final determination may be based on any or all of the following: (1) length and seriousness of prior criminal record; (2) family history; (3) marital situation; (4) vocational and professional skills; (5) education; (6) physical condition; (7) living habits in a free community; (8) behavior and progress while incarcerated. The Board possesses the expertise and experience for ascertaining which factors are determinative from the unique situation presented by each applicant.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">Scarpa alleges that the Board placed undue emphasis on his prior criminal convictions in denying him parole. Additionally he asserts that it did not investigate his marital situation or the job opportunities which would be available if granted parole.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-7\">Two underlying criteria guide the Board in its decision-making process. First, whether there is a reasonable possibility that the prospective parolee will remain at liberty without violating the law, and second, will such release be compatible with the welfare of society.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b349-12\"> Parole is an integral part of the rehabilitative process for convicted felons. One\u2019s propensity for criminal conduct is surely a strong indicator in deciding whether parole should be granted.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The weight to be given Scar-pa\u2019s criminal history is solely within the province of the Board\u2019s broad discretion in determining parole eligibility. It is not the function of the court to second-guess the outcome of such proceedings or what factors went into- their formulation.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b349-13\">We see no reason why the Board should be forced to make a full scale investigation of all the supportive facts used by the prisoner in applying for parole.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The Board operates under a tremendous work load.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> For example in the instant case, even assuming that Scarpa had a stable family and guaranteed employment, it was not unreasonable for the Board to base their ultimate decision denying Scarpa\u2019s parole on his extensive past criminal record.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-14\">Scarpa\u2019s constitutional challenge is likewise without merit. The specific standards for procedural due process depend upon a \u201ccomplexity of factors.\u201d <footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The standards of due process may expand or contract depending on the particular governmental activity involved. However, we discern a distinct and controlling difference between a Board eligibility hearing and the cases relied <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>upon by Scarpa to support his constitutional attack.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-4\">All of the authorities cited by Scarpa concern instances where the government seeks to take action which would presumptively deprive one of goods, rights, or privileges which <em>he already possesses. </em>Each case mandates a hearing <em>before </em>governmental action is initiated which might cause a deprivation.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">The emerging and underlying principle is clear; once a cognizable benefit is conferred or received, governmental action must not be employed to deprive or infringe upon that right without some form of prior hearing. We are unaware, however, of any authority for the proposition that the full panoply of due process protections attaches every time the government takes some action which confers a new status on the individual or denies a request for a different status.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-6\">Whether the Board grants parole is a clearly distinguishable exercise of discretion from revoking one\u2019s conditional freedom. The fifth amendment commands that the government shall not deprive one of his life, liberty or property without due process of law. Scarpa is a convicted felon currently incarcerated in prison for his past transgressions. This manifest deprivation of liberty is the result of a due process hearing. The sentencing judge mandated a possible confinement of eight years. Scarpa now attempts to equate the <em>possibility </em>of conditional freedom with the <em>right to </em>conditional freedom. We find such logic unacceptable.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b350-14\">If the Board refuses to grant parole, Scarpa has suffered no deprivations. He continues the sentence originally imposed by the court. He does not allege that the Board\u2019s actions were arbitrary, fraudulent, unlawful or without reason, but only that it did not fully investigate his case. We have previously discussed the weakness of this allegation.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-15\">The courts have repeatedly rejected Scarpa\u2019s contentions. These decisions are based on the realization that the granting of parole is not an adversary proceeding.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> The Board\u2019s position in this regard was adequately stated in Hyser v. Reed,<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> by Judge (now Chief Justice) Burger:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-16\">. At this stage the contact between prisoner and Board includes none of the incidents or procedural <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>safeguards which attend a criminal trial because the Board, at this stage, must evaluate the prisoner\u2019s record as a whole to determine whether he is a good risk for parole .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">Due process rights do not attach at such proceedings. In the absence of evidence of flagrant, unwarranted, or unauthorized action by the Board, it is not the function of the courts to review such proceedings.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">In sum, we find that Scarpa\u2019s complaint construed liberally both in its factual allegations and constitutional assertions, to be without merit. The procedures adopted by the Board are not manifestly unfair but only evidence an intent to evoke a reasoned determination of whether to grant parole. It may be that Congress in its legislative wisdom will see fit to adopt the procedures here urged, but this we refuse to do by judicial fiat based on some theory of justification through constitutional compulsion. If legislation is adopted, the enactment will very likely set forth appropriate guidelines and standards of judicial review.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-7\">The judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b347-17\">.

In making that determination the Board is not restricted by rules of evidence or procedures developed for the purpose of determining legal or factual issues. It must consider many factors of a nonlegal nature, such as psychiatric reports with respect to the prisoner, his mental and moral attitudes, his vocational education and training, the manner in which he has used his recreation time, his physical and emotional health . . .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b350-19\">Menechino v.

BROWN, Chief Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"ABo\">concurring :</p>\n<p id=\"b351-9\">Although I had entertained a view requiring reversal, I now join in an affirmance largely on the basis of the factors emphasized in Judge Clark\u2019s concurrence. To it I would add that the whole complaint reflected that petitioner was demanding that within about three months of his arrival at the Federal prison, the parole authorities had to make all of the investigations and determinations which might, on Judge Tuttle\u2019s analysis, later be required. The complaint, read with the rosy <em>Conley </em>glasses, asserted that it was an abuse of administrative discretion not to set all these wheels then and there in motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-11\">I think, on the other hand, the District Court was entitled to say that any genuine realistic plan for rehabilitation of a prisoner, whose record included the character of convictions here, should require that the prisoner at least be around for some observation, study and evaluation by prison authorities. Indeed that is the objective behind a \u00a7 4208(a) (2) indeterminative sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-12\">It is easy to say that some character of factual hearing must be had to determine whether these conclusory allegations are supportable. But to apply mechanically procedural rules appropriate to an ordinary damage suit to the situation of prisoner parole problems imperils the parole structure and its beneficent aims. With unrestricted access to the nearest Federal Court and the ease with which denial of broad constitutional claims can be asserted, the prison-parole authorities might have to answer almost daily the complaints of numberless prisoners dissatisfied with the progress or lack of progress with their current requests. Federal Courts must, of course, be open to prisoners. But unless access to a Court is to become an illusion from the judicial system being powerless to act from the sheer volume of such claims, we must be certain when importuned to interfere that the complaint realistically read shows arbitrary action constituting abuse of administrative discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-13\">The complaint here fails to meet that test.</p>\n<author id=\"b352-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>CLARK, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"Afi\">with whom SIMPSON, Circuit Judge, joins, concurring:</p>\n<p id=\"b352-4\">The en banc majority does not disagree with Judge Tuttle\u2019s dissenting observation that parole hearings provided to prisoners must comply with the regulations promulgated by the Board, nor does the majority disagree with the Conley v. Gibson principle that the petitioner\u2019s complaint, which stands unchallenged in this dismissal proceeding, governs the application of the law to this case. The difference between the two views is basically factual and to me reconciliation lies in what the whole complaint asserted. A reading of the extensive quotations from Scarpa\u2019s pleading which asserted the fact background of his case (see the original panel opinion in this case, 468 F.2d 31) makes it crystal clear that the Board had before it not just Scarpa\u2019s criminal record, but also a great deal of other information provided by Scarpa in his application for parole and by the Board\u2019s investigative forces. Without reservation, I concur in Judge Gewin\u2019s opinion for the en banc court.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b352-5\">TUTTLE, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"A05\">with whom WISDOM, GOLDBERG and GODBOLD, Circuit Judges, join, dissenting:</p>\n<p id=\"b352-6\">With deference, I dissent from the opinion and the judgment of the court. Also, with deference, I must say that I think the difference between the result reached by the majority and that which I believe to be correct arises from a failure of the majority opinion to meet the issues <em>actually raised </em>by Scarpa\u2019s complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-7\">Since the opinion of the court recognizes, as, of course, it must, that the allegations of Scarpa\u2019s complaint are to be taken as true, Conley v. Gibson, 355 U.S. 41, 78 S.Ct. 99, 2 L.Ed.2d 80 (1957); Hargrave v. McKinney (5th Cir.) 413 F.2d 320, it seems that there should be little difficulty in stating the issues simply by reading the petition in light of any legal principles that may touch on the rights of an applicant for parole.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-11\">I regret my inability, in spite of every effort to do so, clearly enough to state the issues in the original opinion written for the court. The result is that the present majority opinion contains several critical statements dealing with Scar-pa\u2019s allegations which I think inadequately state his contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-12\">(1) The first statement which I think inadequately states the true situation (especially because of Scarpa\u2019s primary contention that the Board acted <em>solely </em>on his record of convictions and did not consider his record while at Sing Sing) is the following: \u201cHaving <em>completed </em>his state sentence\u201d (emphasis added). This may or may not be technically a correct statement, but it fails to state that he was <em>paroled </em>from his state sentence in New York.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-13\">(2) The second impression given by the language of the majority opinion which I think misses the principal basis of Scarpa\u2019s attack is the following: \u201cHe further urged that the Board did not follow the applicable regulations which govern its internal procedures because it did not <em>fully </em>investigate <em>all </em>the information he submitted in his application for parole\u201d (emphasis added). Scarpa\u2019s whole case, on the other hand, was based on his contention that the Board did not investigate <em>any </em>of the information submitted by him <em>at all. </em>This is reiterated in his allegations that the Board \u201cpredicated their denial of parole with <em>nothing </em>before them except reports from various sources belonging to the Federal Government, <em>solely </em>pertaining to the criminal history of plaintiff\u201d.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b352-14\">(3) The third statement that, with deference, it seems to me, misses the real point is this statement in the opinion : \u201cThe [trial] court held that it was not improper for the Board to place con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>trolling emphasis on Scarpa\u2019s previous criminal record in denying parole\u201d. What seems to me to be faulty about this statement is that it implies that the trial court was dealing with a record that disclosed a Board proceeding in which several factors (such as those mentioned in the majority opinion) <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> were considered by the Board and the Board then placed <em>\u201ccontrolling\u201d </em>emphasis on Scarpa\u2019s criminal record. To the contrary, according to the complaint, \u201cthe consideration afforded the plaintiff for possible release was predicated <em>solely </em>upon plaintiff\u2019s past criminal record\u201d (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b353-4\">(4) The fourth statement which I think indicates a failure of the court to come to grips with the real issue is the following: \u201cScarpa alleges that the Board placed undue emphasis on his prior criminal convictions in denying him parole\u201d. Of course, it is true that Scarpa, in different words, alleged that the Board placed undue emphasis on his prior criminal convictions, but the truth is he alleged a lot more \u2014 so much more, in fact, that it completely changes the entire issue. He alleges that the Board placed <em>exclusive, sole </em>reliance on his past criminal record \u2014 this is quite a different allegation from the one stated in the majority opinion, even though it can be said to be included within the language used by the majority opinion. I would, of course, agree that it is not the court\u2019s province to re-weigh the evidence or re-place the <em>emphasis. </em>The question is whether the Board can fail even to consider anything <em>except </em>the criminal record, and then deny the parole on that alone.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-7\">(5) Finally, in discussing Scarpa\u2019s constitutional arguments, the majority opinion says: \u201cHe does not allege that the Board\u2019s actions were arbitrary, fraudulent, unlawful or without reason, but only that it did not <em>fully </em>investigate his case\u201d (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b353-15\">It is difficult to understand the statement that Scarpa did not allege that the Board\u2019s actions were \u201cunlawful\u201d when the short statement of fact at the beginning of the majority opinion says: \u201cHe based his claim for relief on the internal procedures and practices of the Board <em>which he asserted, denied him due process of law\" </em>(emphasis added). With deference, I would think that an allegation that he had been denied due process would fit within the definition of \u201cunlawful\u201d no matter how narrowly the majority of the court means to use that word. Moreover, while this pro se petitioner did not use the precise word \u201carbitrary\u201d I would think that the clear statement that the Board failed to carry out its own prescribed procedures would be a sufficient allegation of \u201carbitrary\u201d action.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-16\">Then, as to the concluding clause, \u201cbut only that it did not <em>fully </em>investigate his case,\u201d I have already pointed out how this is a clearly inadequate statement of Scarpa\u2019s contention. He says that the Board did not truly investigate his case <em>at all, </em>other than reviewing the criminal reports.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-17\">In sum, I think the issue posed by the majority is not the issue which Scarpa sought to raise at all. I think the issue is whether, when a defendant is given a maximum sentence coupled with the right to have consideration for parole at any time, all as provided under the indeterminate sentence procedures of 18 U. S.C.A. \u00a7 4208(a)(2), see footnote 2, majority opinion supra, and he is given a hearing before a parole examiner, the courts have any power to hear a complaint that he has been denied a hearing and will continue to be denied a hearing at which anything will be considered other than his past criminal record.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>What is most disturbing to me here is that the court affirms a dismissal of this case by a trial court on the bare bones pleadings. The Board filed no denial of the charge that it violated its own regulations in conducting the hearing. It did not deny the allegations that it considered <em>solely </em>the criminal reports. Yet the trial court in granting a motion to dismiss made a <em>factual </em>finding \u201cthough the court supports a full, fair hearing and consideration prior to parole decision <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> it cannot say <em>on the facts of this case </em>that petitioner was denied due process\u201d. The court then found facts that appear nowhere in the record. The court merely recited what the regulations require. See 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 2.15. What is required by the regulations <em>is precisely what Scarpa alleges did not occur </em>and there is no contradiction \u2014 except in the government\u2019s brief. Nevertheless, the trial court made a finding that they did occur.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-4\">There is nothing to be gained by repeating what was said in the original opinion, Scarpa v. United States Board of Parole et al., 468 F.2d 81, 5th Cir. (1972) as to the danger and cost of judicial time resulting from dismissal under F.R.Civ.P. 12(b), for failure to state a claim, especially where new and possibly constitutional questions are at issue. Byers v. Byers, 254 F.2d 205, 5th Cir. (1958), Public Affairs Associates, Inc. v. Richover, 369 U.S. 111, 82 S.Ct. 580, 7 L.Ed.2d 604 (1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">The vice of the order appealed from is that it appears (and the majority now approves this result) to have laid down broad prohibitions to prisoner complaints about the fairness of a very important part of our system of criminal justice without a record by which the true facts have been developed. It is no answer to say that \u201cthe Board of Parole is given absolute discretion in matters of parole,\u201d Tarlton v. Clark, 441 F.2d 384, 385, 5th Cir. (1971). Of course, courts cannot reverse a denial of parole, nor order parole granted, but I suggest that no member of this court would hesitate a second to join in court action invalidating either a regulation, by the Board or a proceeding by it if it were acknowledged that its action was a result of a policy or regulation to the effect that no consideration for parole would be given to any particular class of prisoners or to any person convicted of a particular crime. Such a course of action would be so obviously arbitrary and an abuse of discretion that it would be stopped in a moment. So much, then, for the \u201cabsolute discretion\u201d proposition. In point of fact the majority opinion itself does not seem to me to stand on that basis. It stands rather on the proposition that what Scarpa says happened to him (although as I have pointed out above, I think the opinion does not adequately describe what Scarpa says happened) and what he says will continue to happen to him does not raise an issue of abuse of discretion or due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-9\">To the contrary, I think the petition alleges a clear case of abuse of discretion and failure to follow the regulations of the Board itself such as to require that further proceedings be pursued in order to resolve the truth or falsity of Scarpa\u2019s complaint. Moreover, I think the recent thrust of Supreme Court opinions may well indicate that arbitrary and unfair procedures of the Parole Board are subject to court review because of want of due process. See in this connection Morrissey v. Brewer, 408 U.S. 471, 92 S.Ct. 2593, 33 L.Ed.2d 484 (1972) where the Court in a <em>revocation </em>of parole case said that \u201cparole has become an integral part of the penological system.\u201d The Court also said: \u201csociety has a further interest in treating the parolee with a basic fairness: fair treatment in parole revocations will enhance the chance of rehabilitation by avoiding reactions to arbitrariness.\u201d 408 U.S. 471, 484, 92 S.Ct. 2593, 2602. Is not the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>same reasoning applicable to the manner in which parole applications are to be treated? Cf. Goldberg v. Kelly, 397 U. S. 254, 90 S.Ct. 1011, 25 L.Ed.2d 287.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">The distinction drawn by the majority between a hearing to revoke parole and a hearing to grant parole is, of course, a valid one. However, the fact that there is a distinction is still a far cry from saying that while a revocation hearing is subject to due process requirements Morrissey v. Brewer, <em>supra, </em>a parole hearing itself can be conducted in absolute disregard of all due process requirements. The Court in Morrissey said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ACN\">\u201cWhether any procedural protections are due depends on the extent to which an individual will be \u2018condemned to suffer grievous loss.\u2019 Joint Anti-Fascist Refugee Committee v. McGrath, 341 U.S. 123, 168 [71 S.Ct. 624, 646, 95 L.Ed. 817] (1951) (Frankfurter, J., concurring), quoted in Goldberg v. Kelly, 397 U.S. 254, 263 [90 S.Ct. 1011, 1018, 25 L.Ed.2d 287] (1970). The question is not merely the \u2018weight\u2019 of the individual\u2019s interest, but whether the nature of the interest is one within the contemplation of the \u2018liberty or property\u2019 language of the Fourteenth Amendment. Fuentes v. Shevin, 407 U.S. 67 [92 S.Ct. 1983, 32 L.Ed.2d 556] (1972). Once it is determined that due process applies, the question remains what process is due. It has been said so often by this Court and others as not to require citation of authority that due process is flexible and calls for such procedural protections as the particular situation demands. \u2018 [Consideration of what procedures due process may require under any given set of circumstances must begin with a determination of the precise nature of the government function involved as well as of the private interest that has been affected by governmental action.\u2019 Cafeteria <em>&amp; </em>Restaurant Workers Union v. McElroy, 367 U.S. 886, 895 [89 S.Ct. 1820, 23 L.Ed.2d 349] (1961). To say that the concept of due process is flexible does not mean that judges are at large to apply it to any and all relationships. Its flexibility is in its scope once it has been determined that some process is due; it is a recognition that not all situations calling for procedural safeguards call for the same kind of procedure.\u201d 408 U.S. 471, 481, 92 S.Ct. 2593, 2600.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b355-10\">The facts have not been developed in this case. I am convinced that if they are as alleged by Scarpa, then he is entitled to relief. As was stated in the original opinion in the case, I think it inappropriate to attempt to prescribe precisely what relief might be available to him until all of the facts are known. At the very least it seems to me the government should be required to admit or deny the factual allegations in Scarpa\u2019s complaint. Further proceedings would then depend upon the issues drawn.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-11\">I think the judgment of the trial court should be reversed, as stated in the original opinion and the case remanded for further proceedings as here outlined.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b352-8\">. The opinion is technically correct in saying that Scarpa criticized the Board for not investigating all of the items of information he supplied, but the court misses the point that the crux of his complaint is that it did not consider <em>any </em>of them.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b353-8\">.
