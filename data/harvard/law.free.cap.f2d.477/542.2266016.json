The District Court properly certified the order as involving a controlling question of law warranting this interlocutory appeal under Section 1292(b), and by an order dated July 26, 1972, this Court granted Appellant leave to appeal. The District Court\u2019s Memorandum Opinion is reported at 355 F.Supp. 902.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-10\">Appellees are manufacturers of mesh window bags used by vegetable growers to package their products. Appellant is a distributor of these bags manufactured by Appellee Union Camp.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-11\">In October 1968 Appellant filed a complaint claiming that he had been injured in his business or property by reason of Appellees\u2019 alleged monopolization and attempts to monopolize in violation of Section 2 of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 2, and conspiracy in violation of Section 1 of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1. The basis of Appellees\u2019 allegedly illegal conduct is the claim that they maintained and enfoi\u2019ced an invalid patent relating to the manufacture of the window bags, knowing the patent to be invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-12\">By agreement of the parties, the District Court made a pretrial determination respecting the applicability of the \u201cpassing-on\u201d defense, which, if available to Appellees, would preclude Appellant\u2019s treble damage action. In ruling on this question, the District Court focused on the following undisputed practice of Appellant as a distributor of Appellee Union\u2019s bags:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b611-13\">\u201c[A]fter obtaining an order from a customer for mesh window bags he would submit the order to Union and would be invoiced at Union\u2019s list price less 5%. The bags were \u2018drop shipped\u2019, i.e., sent directly from Union to plaintiff\u2019s customer. Plaintiff would bill his customer at Union\u2019s full list price. Thus, whatever price Union imposed on the plaintiff, the plaintiff passed on to his customer plus his 5%.\u201d 355 F.Supp. at 904.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b611-14\">For the reasons set forth in the District Court\u2019s Memorandum Opinion, we agree with the Court\u2019s conclusion that the \u201cpassing-on\u201d defense is applicable under the stipulated facts in this suit. Although the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Hanover Shoe, Inc. v. United Shoe Machinery Corp., 392 U.S. 481, 88 S.Ct. 2224, 20 L.Ed.2d 1231 (1968), significantly restricted the availability of this defense, we agree with the District Court\u2019s conclusion that the above method of distribution is comparable to a \u201cpreexisting \u2018cost-plus\u2019 contract,\u201d under which the <em>Hanover </em>Court suggested the defense might still be applicable. 392 U.S. at 494, 88 S.Ct. 2224. <em>Cf. </em>State of West Virginia v. Chas. Pfizer &amp; Co., 440 F.2d 1079, 1086-1088 (2d Cir. 1971). Indeed, the District Court correctly characterized Appellant\u2019s discount as comparable to a sales commission and observed that \u201c[t]he only reasonable inference is that the plaintiff himself profited by any increase in prices set by defendant Union.\u201d 355 F.Supp. at 906.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-15\">We affirm the District Court\u2019s order holding that the \u201cpassing-on\u201d defense is valid and applicable under the facts of this case.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
