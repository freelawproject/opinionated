According to his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1055\">*1055</page-number>claims, the Hunzas were a healthy little tribe of agrarians in the high mountains of Asia where the soil is especially rich and unique. Hampson had found himself a similar Eden, a farm near Cherry Creek hard by the little town of Duvall, Washington. There mud on the farm had the texture of hand cream. There Hunza grass was grown, but not allowed to mature. Its tender shoots were cut with a field chopper. Then it was idyllically processed by flash dehydration. One might remain lost in the puffery, except the great product, never touched by human hands, came down to reality with the postscript notation: \u201cDoes not contain alfalfa.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1123-5\">Maybe Hampson was before his time (or maybe he just did not live in Southern California where one\u2019s odd dreams can often be richly exploited), but he did not do well financially with his \u201cgreat\u201d product. Eventually in 1968 he sold his dreams and the trademark to Herman Jacobs, one of the owners of H &amp; J Foods, Inc., for $500.00. Jacobs turned it over to the company. Tangibly, in addition to the copyright, there came along a lot of Hampson\u2019s unused labels.</p>\n<p id=\"b1123-6\">But somehow, someway, one Rowe, the predecessor of Reeder, the defendant, operating as Nutrifoods Co. in Southern California, became aware of the legend of Hunza and he started producing health foods, labelling them Hunza\u00ae. The printer\u2019s bug \u00ae is the historical symbol for a registered trademark. Neither Rowe nor Reeder ever attempted to register Hunza as a trademark. (H &amp; J is also a Southern California food producer.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1123-7\">Within a few months after the purchase, H &amp; J had sued Reeder, seeking an injunction and an accounting of profits. The first count was for trademark infringement. The second was a pendent count for unfair competition. H &amp; J Foods, Inc., received a judgment against Reeder of $26,519.07 plus interest and heavy costs, which included attorney fees of $14,040.00. The attorney fees are allowable under California\u2019s statutory law on unfair competition. Fleischmann Distilling Corp. v. Maier Brewing Company, 386 U.S. 714, 87 S.Ct. 1404, 18 L.Ed.2d 475 (1967); Friend v. H. A. Friend &amp; Co., 416 F.2d 526 (9th Cir. 1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b1123-10\">On this appeal, the whole result is attacked. We affirm the granting of the injunction, but hold that the assignment carried no right to profits before the date of the assignment. Further, this result will necessarily require a heavy reduction in the attorney fees allowed. Also, some adjustment will have to be made in the amount assessed as the cost of the accounting.</p>\n<p id=\"b1123-11\">Reeder does not challenge the validity of Hampson\u2019s registration of \u201cHunza.\u201d He does, however, challenge the assignment of the mark to Jacobs. Most of his objections are to the district court\u2019s findings of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b1123-12\">The claim that Reeder presses most vigorously is that the assignment was invalid because it was \u201cin gross,\u201d and an assignment apart from the business with which the mark has been associated. See Mister Donut of America v. Mr. Donut, Inc., 418 F.2d 838 (9th Cir. 1969), and 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1060.</p>\n<p id=\"b1123-13\">While Hampson did not transfer much except the trifling amount of goodwill along with his trademark, the reason was that he had little else to transfer in the way of tangible assets related to \u201cHunza.\u201d The district court found that \u201cHerman Jacobs contacted Hampson and by assignment August 7, 1968, purchased from Hampson for $500 all right, title and interest in and to the trademark \u2018Hunza,\u2019 including the right to sue for past infringements, together with the goodwill of the business symbolized and appurtenant to the mark, Registration No. 644,085, and a quantity of \u2018Hunza\u2019 labels, advertising news releases, and promotional materials.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1123-14\">Except as to past infringement, we believe the court\u2019s finding is supported by the evidence, and is therefore proper. Hampson gave up the right to use the mark, \u201cHunza,\u201d and Jacobs acquired all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1056\">*1056</page-number>of Hampson\u2019s related tangible assets of any conceivable value. In this case, this was sufficient. Cf. Sterling Brewers, Inc. v. Schenley Industries, Inc., 441 F. 2d 675 (C.C.P.A.1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b1124-4\">Reeder further contends that H &amp; J has used the \u201cHunza\u201d mark on products so dissimilar to the registration specifications that the mark is invalid. Although we might have found differently, the district court found substantial similarity, and we do not believe that finding is clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b1124-5\">On H &amp; J\u2019s pendent claim arising under California\u2019s unfair competition law, the court found that the public was likely to be deceived by Reeder\u2019s use of the mark \u201cHunza,\u201d and the bug,\u00ae. We express no opinion on the validity of the finding to the extent it involves use of \u00ae. The finding of deception based on use of \u201cHunza\u201d alone is sufficient, and it is supported by the evidence. See Payne v. United California Bank, 23 Cal.App.3d 850, 100 Cal.Rptr. 672 (1st Dist.1972). A specific finding of \u201cpalming off\u201d was not necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b1124-6\">Much of the award stems from damages for infringement by Reeder prior to the assignment from Hampson to Jacobs. Such pre-assignment damages are disfavored, and they are allowed only when the right to sue is clearly spelled out in a valid assignment. George W. Luft Co., Inc., v. Zande Cosmetic Co., Inc., 142 F.2d 536 (2d Cir. 1944). Here, the only evidence of Hampson\u2019s intent to assign the right to sue for past infringement is the following statement of Herman Jacobs. \u201c[Hampson] also gave a remark. He said, \u2018If you get the mark, you can sue that guy in Tulsa, Oklahoma, Akin [a former partner of Reeder], because he is using the mark illegally.\u2019 \u201d We do not pass on the question whether this parol evidence was properly admitted. We do feel, however, this kind of testimony is insufficient to entitle H &amp; J to pick up pre-assignment damages. The language, if admissible, is not express enough. This conclusion will have a heavy impact on the amount of damages, and as above indicated, the district court must reconsider on remand the amount of attorneys\u2019 fees and the amount of costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b1124-8\">The district court was not clearly erroneous in its implicit rejection of Reed-er\u2019s \u201cclean hands\u201d argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b1124-9\">As an epilogue, we note that probably counsel would have served their clients just as well without overridiculing each others\u2019 briefs. The briefs, perchance, were written for their respective clients, not us.</p>\n<p id=\"b1124-10\">The judgment is affirmed as to the granting of the injunction. Otherwise, the judgment is remanded for proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1124-11\">Each side will bear its own costs of the appeal.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"A-c\">.
