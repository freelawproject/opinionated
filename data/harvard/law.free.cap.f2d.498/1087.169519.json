Appellant Albert S. Mounee was convicted following a jury trial in the criminal district court in Tarrant County, Texas, located in the Northern District of Texas. In his petition for writ of habeas corpus filed with the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas, Mounee alleged that he was in custody of the Texas Department of Corrections [TDC] Railroad Project in Maydelle, Texas, located in the Eastern District. It appears from the notarization on the pro se petition, however, that by the time Mounee actually filed the application he had been returned to the TDC Ellis Unit in Walker County, Texas, which is located in the Southern District of Texas. He remains in confinement in the Ellis Unit. Accordingly, the district court acted correctly in dismissing appellant\u2019s petition for want of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1163-24\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
