L. c. 221, \u00a7 50, following rupture of the attorney-client relationship. We affirm a judgment awarding a lien of $108,000 in favor of Cain, Hibbard, Myers &amp; Cook (hereafter \u201cCHMC\u201d), a professional corporation.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b615-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>CHMC had acted as counsel for Phelps Steel, Inc. (Phelps), a fabricator and erector of structural steel, in a construction contract dispute with Pyramid Company of Holyoke (Pyramid) (see note 1). That case had gone well for Phelps, resulting in a judgment in its favor of $286,651. Between the time of a master\u2019s report, which was, by any measure, a triumph for Phelps, and the report\u2019s adoption, the relationship between Phelps and CHMC soured. Phelps found fault, among other matters, with CHMC\u2019s decision not to file objections to the master\u2019s report (that report had resolved the major issues in favor of Phelps), the manner in which CHMC was keeping Phelps informed, the amount of lawyers\u2019 time spent, and the decision to order daily transcript. One week prior to a scheduled hearing before the master to consider Pyramid\u2019s objections to the master\u2019s report, CHMC protested what it saw as \u201cattacks on [its] personal integrity and professional competence.\u201d It asked for a written vote of confidence from Phelps dispelling CHMC\u2019s perception. Failing that, CHMC said, it would report to the master that it was not authorized to proceed on Phelps\u2019 behalf. Far from giving CHMC comfort, Phelps responded with complaints about \u201cblackmail\u201d and \u201cabandonment.\u201d Phelps also informed CHMC that it had engaged a replacement.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-5\">1. <em>CHMC\u2019s Entitlement to an Attorney\u2019s Lien. </em>Relying on <em>White </em>v. <em>Harlow, </em>5 Gray 463, 466 (1855), Phelps argues that the withdrawal of a lawyer from the cause forfeits the attorney\u2019s lien. Even if that were a correct statement of the law, it would leave open the question whether CHMC left the case upon its initiative or was pushed. The same master who had heard the underlying construction contract dispute held hearings (on order of the court) on the fee and attorney\u2019s lien controversies. In substance, the master found that CHMC had been placed in a position where it was bound to withdraw, i. e., it was pushed.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-6\">The applicable principle regarding waiver of an attorney\u2019s lien by withdrawal is not nearly so broad as Phelps states it. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number><em>White </em>v. <em>Harlow, </em>5 Gray at 466, assumes that the withdrawal of the lawyer in that case was \u201cwholly voluntary.\u201d Whether withdrawal works a waiver of the attorney\u2019s lien depends on whether the attorney had good cause to withdraw. Thus if, for example, withdrawal occurs because of a breakdown in the lawyer-client relationship, illness of the lawyer, or development of an unforeseen, and reasonably not foreseeable, conflict of interest the attorney\u2019s lien remains intact. <em>Powers </em>v. <em>Manning, </em>154 Mass. 370, 375-377 (1891). <em>Pearlmutter </em>v. <em>Alexander, </em>97 Cal. App. 3d Supp. 16, 19-20 (1979). <em>Ambrose </em>v. <em>Detroit Edison Co., </em>65 Mich. App. 484, 488 (1975). See also <em>Schwartz </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>58 Misc. 2d 998, 999 (N.Y. Sup. Ct. 1969); <em>Midvale Motors, Inc. </em>v. <em>Saunders, </em>21 Utah 2d 181, 182-183 (1968). Breakdown of the lawyer-client relationship serves as good cause for withdrawal, without waiver of the attorney\u2019s lien. See <em>M.E. </em>v. <em>S.G., </em>124 Misc.2d 851, 851-853 (N.Y. Fam. Ct. 1984). Cf. <em>National Sales &amp; Serv. Co. </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>136 Ariz. 544, 545-547 (1983). The lawyer-client relationship is founded on trust and confidentiality. When those foundations deteriorate, it is not only impractical to persist in the relationship, it diminishes the integrity of the bar to do so. <em>Salem Realty Co. </em>v. <em>Matera, </em>10 Mass. App. Ct. 571, 575 (1980), <em>S.C., </em>384 Mass. 803 (1981). See also <em>Ambrose </em>v. <em>Detroit Edison Co., </em>65 Mich. App. at 488-489; <em>In re Dunn, </em>205 N.Y. 398, 402 (1912).</p>\n<p id=\"b616-5\">It is also a factor in favor of CHMC that it had rendered substantially all the services required to obtain a favorable result for Phelps at the trial level. Thus, even if CHMC\u2019s withdrawal from the case had not been provoked by Phelps, there was, assuming some good cause for withdrawal, a solid basis for the statutory lien, which attaches \u201c[f]rom the authorized commencement of an action.\u201d G. L. c. 221, \u00a7 50. See <em>In re Hoy\u2019s Claim, </em>93 F. Supp. 265, 266 (D. Mass. 1950). Cf. <em>Newton Housing Authy. </em>v. <em>Cumberland Constr. Co., </em>5 Mass. App. Ct. 1, 8-10 (1977). See also <em>Salem Realty Co. </em>v. <em>Matera, </em>384 Mass. at 804.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-6\">2. <em>Reasonableness of the fee. </em>Initially, Phelps had engaged CHMC on a time-charge basis. After commencement of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>litigation, Phelps found the cost of maintaining the action burdensome and asked to go on a contingent fee basis. Client and lawyer entered into a written contingent fee agreement on October 8, 1983. See S.J.C. Rule 3:05, as appearing in 382 Mass. 762 (1981). The master regarded the contingent fee as abrogated by the departure of CHMC from the case, compare <em>Salem Realty Co. </em>v. <em>Matera, </em>384 Mass. at 804, and analyzed the fee CHMC was entitled to on a quantum meruit basis. CHMC has interposed no objection to the quantum meruit approach.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b617-5\">We have reviewed the master\u2019s report and are more than satisfied that he considered the relevant factors, which included: the time spent; the skill and experience of counsel; the complexity of the case; the calibre of the services; and the success achieved. <em>See Mulhern </em>v. <em>Roach, </em>398 Mass. 18, 24-25 (1986); <em>Salem Realty Co. </em>v. <em>Matera, </em>10 Mass. App. Ct. at 576-577. See also the citation to recent authority in <em>Bird </em>v. <em>Bird, ante </em>362, 370 (1987). The testimony of Mr. Rogers of CHMC concerning the time expended by him and Mr. Myers of that firm in preparing the case and trying it for twenty-nine days was perfectly good evidence and, in any event, not made the basis of any objection. The findings of the master are not clearly erroneous, mutually inconsistent, contradictory, unwarranted by the evidence or vitiated in view of the controlling law. <em>Wormstead </em>v. <em>Town Manager of Saugus, </em>366 Mass. 659, 660 (1975). <em>Covich </em>v. <em>Chambers, </em>8 Mass. App. Ct. 740, 743 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b617-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b614-17\"> The lien is against the fruit of the judgment recovered through the efforts of counsel asserting the lien. That is a \u201ccharging lien,\u201d distinguishable from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>a \u201cretaining lien,\u201d which lies against the client\u2019s papers and personal property in the hands of the lawyer. See generally, McCann, The Attorney\u2019s Lien in Massachusetts, 69 Mass.L.Rev. 68 (No. 2, 1984).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b617-7\"> The point has not been raised whether, when a lawyer is employed under a contingent fee agreement, the limit of the fees which the lawyer may earn from the matter is that which would have resulted by application of the contingent fee agreement. We intimate no views on the question.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
