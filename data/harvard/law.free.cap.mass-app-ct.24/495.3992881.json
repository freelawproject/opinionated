L. c. 6A, \u00a7\u00a7 32 and 36; G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14. A judge of the Superior Court, at the request of the parties, reported the case without decision to this court. See Mass.R.Civ.P. 64, 365 Mass. 831-832 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">\n<em>Background.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b518-6\">In November, 1979, the commission assigned a prospective per diem rate of $341.03 to the hospital,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> pursuant to a rate setting methodology established by the commission and set forth in 114.1 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7\u00a7 3.00 et seq. (1979). The regulations provided the procedure for calculating Medicaid rates.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> They also set out eleven kinds of cost increases, otherwise not recognized in the rate, which could be a basis for a provider\u2019s request to the commission for an administrative rate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>adjustment. Among those factors were costs associated with capital expenditures for which the hospital had received a determination of need pursuant to G. L. c. Ill, \u00a7\u00a7 25B-25G, costs incurred because of statutory or regulatory requirements, and extraordinary increases which threatened the hospital\u2019s financial stability. 114.1 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 3.14 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">The hospital appealed its rate to the division pursuant to G. L. c. 6A, \u00a7 36, claiming that the failure of the commission\u2019s regulations to provide a mechanism for rate adjustment based on increased provision of ancillary services and procedures per patient day (\u201cintensity\u201d) rendered the commission\u2019s rate formulation, and, therefore, the hospital\u2019s rate, unfair. The hospital claimed to have experienced intensity, which was not reflected in its rate, between 1977 and 1980, resulting in a twenty-two dollar per patient day shortfall and a $400,000 loss to the hospital for fiscal year 1980. The hospital sought before the division an adjustment of its 1980 rate to reflect the claimed intensity changes and consequences.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-6\">The intensity claim was based on two primary factors: (1) a reduction in patient\u2019s average length of stay (ALOS intensity); and (2) a shift in the hospital\u2019s case mix toward more intensely ill patients (case mix intensity). The hospital presses only its ALOS intensity claim in this appeal. According to the ALOS intensity theory presented to the division, pressures for cost containment came from various sources, including Federal legislation creating Professional Standards Review Organizations (PSRO\u2019s) to monitor the efficient use of resources by hospitals receiving Federal funds (see 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1320c [1976 &amp; Supp. IV 1980]), pressures for cost control exerted by the insurance industry, and the hospital\u2019s self-imposed restraints designed to achieve more efficient use of its resources. These pressures resulted in decreases in the average length of time patients remained hospitalized and contributed to what the hospital described as an industry-wide \u201cphenomenon\u201d of ALOS intensity.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-7\">Reductions in ALOS save some patient day costs. The hospital contends, however, that while ALOS reductions eliminate relatively passive days of hospitalization, they also compress <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>the delivery of ancillary services and procedures, such as laboratory, radiology and anesthesiology, into fewer days. As a result, the average cost per day for the days in which patients are actually hospitalized tends to be higher. Compounding the problem, technological innovations, such as computer monitoring of cardiac patients, use of computerized tomography scanners, ultrasound, and nuclear medicine, have increased the intensity of ancillary services and raised the hospital\u2019s per diem patient costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">At the relevant times, the commission\u2019s regulations did not provide a mechanism for requesting administrative rate adjustments based on intensity. See note 17, <em>infra. </em>The hospital concedes <em>that the </em>commission calculated its <em>rate </em>correctly according to the commission\u2019s regulations for hospitals in its class and that the regulations are lawful as far as they go. The hospital makes no claim that the rate is confiscatory. See <em>Massachusetts State Pharmaceutical Assn. </em>v. <em>Rate Setting </em>Commn., 387 Mass. 122, 136 n.13 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b520-6\">At the opening of the hearing before the division, the commission moved for dismissal, asserting that the division had no authority to hear the hospital\u2019s appeal as it constituted a facial challenge to the commission\u2019s regulations, that the hospital failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted as the commission\u2019s regulations did not recognize a claim based on intensity, and that the hospital\u2019s claims sought to invalidate the prospective system of reimbursement. The motion was denied, the division ruling that it had the authority to \u201cgo beyond\u201d commission regulations in certain circumstances. The hearings officer concluded that the division had authority to ignore validly promulgated and properly applied commission regulations if it found that the resulting rate was not fair, adequate and reasonable, and if it found that a different method of calculation would yield a fair, adequate and reasonable rate for that provider. The division relied on the decision in <em>Cliff House Nursing Home, Inc. </em>v. <em>Rate Setting Commn., </em>378 Mass. 189 (1979),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> along with two previous division deci<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>sions in which hearing officers had recognized ALOS intensity though the commission\u2019s regulations did not.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">At the hearing, there was evidence from the hospital as follows. Based on the hospital\u2019s study of its ancillary service utilization, it had experienced increased ALOS (as well as case mix)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> intensity between 1977 and 1980. The hospital monitors patients\u2019 length of stay in order to comply with PSRO requirements, as well as to ensure the hospital\u2019s efficient use of its resources. The increasingly complicated case mix of patients at the hospital, the decreasing length of hospital stay, and technological advances have all resulted in greater intensity of care. The validity of the hospital\u2019s statistical support for its claims of increased intensity of ancillary services between 1977 and 1980 was challenged by the commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">The hearings officer refused relief. She held that because the hospital was seeking an \u201cextraordinary\u201d remedy in requesting the division to bypass properly promulgated commission regulations and to recognize \u201cintensity\u201d as a basis for rate adjustment, the hospital would be held to a heightened burden of proof.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The hearings officer concluded that the hospital had not met its burden of showing by \u201ccredible and substantial\u201d evidence that it had experienced the claimed intensity and that its rate was consequently not fair, adequate and reasonable in light of regulatory goals such as cost containment. Specifically, she found that the hospital\u2019s escalating costs and complexity of care were caused, \u201cto an undetermined extent,\u201d by evolutionary changes in medical practice, costs intended to be contained <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>by the prospective system, as well as by the hospital\u2019s desire to remain a leader in its field. She further found that the statistics on which the hospital based its claim of increased intensity of ancillary services were not sufficiently precise or reliable to form the basis for an alternative calculation of its rate.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">\n<em>The Statutory Framework.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b522-6\">A detailed statutory framework sets out the Commonwealth\u2019s policies and procedures for reimbursing health care providers. The Legislature has delegated to the commission \u201csole responsibility for establishing fair, reasonable and adequate rates to be paid providers of health care services by governmental units . . . .\u201d G. L. c. 6A, \u00a7 32, first par.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The commission establishes rates of reimbursement to hospitals for the care of publicly assisted patients under the Medicaid Program. See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1396 et seq. (1982); G. L. c. 118E.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-7\">Commission members include a chairman (who must have administrative experience, as well as an advanced degree in business administration, public administration, or law), a certified public accountant, and a person experienced in medical economics. G. L. c. 6A, \u00a7 32, first par. The commission establishes rates for hospitals \u201cafter public hearing, at least as often as annually,\u201d <em>id. </em>at third par., and is charged with \u201cpromulgating] rules and regulations for the administration of its duties and the determination of rates . . . subject to the procedures described by chapter thirty A.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at tenth par. The Legislature has directed the commission to \u201cestablish rates on a prospective basis, subject to rules and regulations promulgated by the commission whenever possible. \u201d <em>Id. </em>at sixth par.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-8\">The commission\u2019s regulatory activities are subject to oversight by a rate setting commission hospital policy review board (the board) consisting of eleven members, two appointed by the Secretary of Human Services and nine appointed by the Governor. Two members must be chosen from persons recommended by the Massachusetts Hospital Association, and one must be a physician chosen from nominees of the Massachusetts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>Medical Society. Other members include representatives of a health system agency, the insurance industry, business, labor and the elderly. The representatives of business, labor and the elderly must have experience in or knowledge of health care delivery or hospital financing. G. L. c. 6A, \u00a7 34A. There are elaborate provisions for, among other things, recommendations and public hearings of the board on proposed regulations of the commission. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b523-5\">The division hears appeals from persons aggrieved by particular rates the commission has established. G. L. c. 6A, \u00a7 36. The division is composed of magistrates responsible for hearing administrative law appeals from various agencies. G. L. c. 7, \u00a7 4H. Administrative magistrates must be members of the Massachusetts bar and must have had trial experience. <em>Ibid. </em>The division conducts rate appeals through \u201cadjudicatory proceeding [s] in accordance with chapter thirty A . . . .\u201d G. L. c. 6A, \u00a7 36, second par.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Section 36 requires that \u201c[o]n appeal, the rate determined for any provider of services shall be adequate, fair and reasonable for such provider, based, among other things, on the costs of such provider\u201d (first par.).</p>\n<p id=\"b523-6\">\n<em>The Division\u2019s Authority.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b523-7\"><em>A </em>procedural or substantive challenge to a regulation of general applicability under which particular rates are established may be asserted in a declaratory judgment action under G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 7, <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and G. L. c. 231A. See <em>Massachusetts Gen. Hosp. </em>v. <em>Rate Setting Commn., </em>359 Mass. 157, 163-165 (1971); <em>Lynn </em>v. <em>Rate Setting </em>Commn., 21 Mass. App. Ct. 576, 579-580 (1986). A substantive challenge is mounted \u201con the ground that the general regulation is substantively defective, that is, inadequate. \u201d <em>Massachusetts State Pharmaceutical Assn. </em>v. <em>Rate Setting </em>Commn., 387 Mass. at 126. On the other hand, an individual provider\u2019s rate (a regulation of particular applica<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>tian) may be initially challenged only by appeal to the division for an adjudicatory hearing. See G. L. c. 6A, \u00a7\u00a7 32 and 36; <em>Massachusetts Gen. Hosp. </em>v. <em>Rate Setting Commn., supra;</em><footnotemark><em>12</em></footnotemark><em> Massachusetts State Pharmaceutical Assn. </em>v. <em>Rate Setting Commn., supra </em>at 139; <em>Lynn </em>v. <em>Rate Setting Commn., supra. </em>See also <em>Palm Manor Nursing Home, Inc. </em>v. <em>Rate Setting Commn., </em>359 Mass. 652, 655 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">The division is an inappropriate forum for a substantive challenge to regulations of general applicability under which particular rates are established. See <em>Massachusetts Gen. Hosp. </em>v. <em>Rate Setting Commn., supra. </em>\u201c[General Laws] c. 6A, \u00a7\u00a7 32 and 36, were written for individual provider appeals from commission regulations setting forth a particular rate or rates for that provider alone.\u201d <em>Massachusetts State Pharmaceutical Assn. </em>v. <em>Rate Setting Commn., supra. See Massachusetts Gen. Hosp. </em>v. <em>Rate Setting Comm., supra. </em>\u201cLiterally,... the statute [G. L. c. 6A, \u00a7\u00a732 and 36] permits an aggrieved provider to appeal to the division from any rate determination of the commission. But the standard expressed for the division\u2019s review of a commission rate determination has little bearing on the propriety of a rate regulation of general applicability. The division\u2019s review is supposed to focus (but not exclusively) on the aggrieved provider\u2019s costs and the reasonableness of the rate for the provider. There is no suggestion that the division should consider whether the rate meets the standard for an industry-wide rate. Nor, as we have held, does the division have any procedure to permit a class action challenge to a rate regulation of general applicability. In short, the statutory and administrative pattern suggests that the division may have no role in a review of a challenge to a regulation prescribing a rate of general application\u201d (footnotes omitted). <em>Massachusetts </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number><em>State Pharmaceutical Assn. </em>v. <em>Rate Setting Commn., </em>387 Mass. at 139-140.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">Our holding is narrow: where a provider\u2019s challenge is to the substantive validity, that is, the adequacy, of a regulation of general application<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> and not to the peculiar application of that regulation to the provider, the division is without authority to act, and the remedy for the provider is to proceed by way of an action for declaratory judgment under G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 7, and G. L. c. 231 A.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b525-6\">The hospital and the division insist that the hospital\u2019s attack on the rate does not constitute a facial challenge to the commission\u2019s regulations but only a complaint that the particular rate set for the hospital does not yield an \u201cadequate, fair and reasonable\u201d return. That, of course, could be said in every case of a challenge to a rate set in accordance with the commission\u2019s regulations providing methodology of general applicability.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>Despite its protestations, the hospital in the proceedings before the division vigorously attacked the substantive validity of regulations of general application, and this is what the division considered and rejected on the merits. The hospital attempted to persuade the division to incorporate ALOS intensity into the methodology of the rate setting calculations. As the hearings officer recognized, the evidence introduced by the hospital was designed to show that ALOS intensity was (and is) an industry-wide \u201cphenomenon\u201d brought on by pressures for cost containment from a variety of sources, including Federal PSRO legislation, the insurance industry, and technological advances. Intensity of any kind was not at the relevant times one of the bases for rate adjustment requests. See 114.1 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 3.14 (1979).<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">The hospital\u2019s challenge here strikes at the heart of the function which the Legislature has given to the commission \u2014 the control of the costs of hospital care in Massachusetts \u2014 and the scheme which the Legislature has put in place to accommodate that purpose. See <em>Mercy Hosp. </em>v. <em>Rate Setting Commn., </em>381 Mass. 34, 39 (1980). The propriety of the exercise of that task through the promulgation of regulations of general application must be reviewed under the standards which obtain in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>a declaratory judgment action, namely, whether the regulations are illegal, arbitrary or capricious. See <em>Massachusetts State Pharmaceutical Assn. </em>v. <em>Rate Setting Commn., supra </em>at 126-127. To allow the division to reach the underlying substantive validity of a general regulation in an ad hoc adjudicatory proceeding,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> ostensibly challenging only a particular rate as yielding an unreasonable return, would indeed \u201cmake the division the ground level rate setter \u2014 a role reserved to the commission.\u201d <em>Woodland Estates, Inc. </em>v. <em>Rate Setting Commn., </em>15 Mass. App. Ct. 297, 301 (1983). The allocation of that function to the division would, in our view, wreak havoc on the regulatory plan established by the Legislature. An across-the-board challenge, as here, to regulations of general applicability ought to be determined on a record established and under the standard of review provided in a declaratory judgment action under G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 7, and G. L. c. 231A.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">A judgment is to enter in the Superior Court remanding the case to the division and directing that the hospital\u2019s appeal from the rate set for it by the commission for the fiscal year 1980 be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b517-15\"> The issue was raised by the commission before the division but not argued in the joint brief initially filed in this court by the commission and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>the division (the division\u2019s decision was adverse to the hospital on the merits), although mention was made of the continuing controversy on the question between the commission and the division. We were informed at oral argument that several decisions of the division pending judicial review involve the issue. Following oral argument, we requested that the parties file further briefs addressing the question. Briefs were thereafter filed by special assistant attorneys general for the division, the Attorney General for the commission, and the hospital. The last of the briefs was filed on May 26, 1987.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b518-8\">For reasons not pertinent to this appeal, the hospital\u2019s rate was adjusted several times and finally established at $345.39.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b518-9\">The rate setting system was a prospective one. A hospital\u2019s per diem rate represented the projected average daily cost that the hospital would incur in treating each of its patients, Medicaid and non-Medicaid, alike. The commission\u2019s rate calculation was a composite of the following basic elements:</p>\n<p id=\"b518-10\">1. Base year costs (the base year is the year two years prior to the rate year; the costs of the year preceding the base year were used if they were lower than base year costs after being adjusted upward by an inflation allowance) increased by an inflation factor.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-11\">2. \u201cNon-operating\u201d expenses, including depreciation and legal fees (\u201cfixed costs\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b518-12\">3. Any allowance resulting from an \u201cadministrative adjustment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b518-13\">These three elements were combined, then divided by allowable base year total patient days to determine a per diem rate.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-14\">A new rate setting methodology was established by G. L. c. 6A, \u00a7 68, added by St. 1982, c. 372, \u00a7 IB. The rate remains prospective, but it is not computed on a per diem basis. The new methodology is set out in detail in \u00a7 68 and in 114.1 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7\u00a7 28.00 et seq.

A Superior Court judge had found that commission rate-setting regulations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>as applied to the Authority\u2019s contributions to the municipal retirement system were arbitrary and capricious. We held that the commission\u2019s motion to dismiss the complaint should have been granted, because at issue was the application of regulations to a single provider under G.

Here, we think, the real controversy concerns the application of general regulations to a single provider and thus the issues relate predominantly to the setting of an individual provider\u2019s reimbursement rate.
