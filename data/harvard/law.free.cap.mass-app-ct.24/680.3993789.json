After one mistrial, a second jury trial from January 27 to February 3, 1986, resulted in verdicts of guilty of all the charges. Robinson was sentenced to terms at M.C.I., Cedar Junction, more fully described below. See part 4 of the discussion in this opinion, and also note 6, <em>infra. </em>Robinson has appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-9\">The victim, on Sunday, August 12, 1984, awoke about 6 a.m., in the bedroom of her first floor apartment in Lynn. A man wearing a nylon stocking over his head and holding a pair of open scissors in one hand was standing near the bed. He was wearing a T-shirt and his trousers \u201cwere dropped to his ankles.\u201d Using the scissors as a weapon at her throat, the man forced the victim to disrobe and to have repeated vaginal, oral, and anal intercourse with him. He then took from her the money in her possession, a gold chain, three rings, and a gold watch. After some insulting remarks, the intruder pushed her into a chair, picked up her legs and placed his finger in her vagina.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-10\">The intruder asked who else was in her apartment, into which the victim had moved four days earlier. The victim replied, \u201cJust my daughter. Please don\u2019t hurt her.\u201d The intruder said, \u201cMaybe I\u2019ll do her next.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b703-11\">Hearing that, the victim broke away from him, \u201cran into the hall and yelled upstairs\u201d for Joseph Fleury, the landlord, who lived in the second floor apartment. The assailant started out the back door \u201cand then came back . . . and grabbed his [the assailant\u2019s] vest, which was hanging on the bedroom door.\u201d He \u201ccame at\u201d the victim \u201cwith the scissors.\u201d She put her hands <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>over her face and he stabbed her in the arm. Then he \u201cran out the back door.\u201d His mask and the scissors were found in the apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-5\">The landlord, Fleury, and a cousin of the victim, who lived on the third floor, came to the victim\u2019s first floor apartment. The victim, her young daughter, and the cousin went to the cousin\u2019s apartment. The police were called and they soon arrived. The victim was taken to the Lynn Hospital and was examined there, and then went to the police station.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-6\">The victim never saw her assailant\u2019s face because of the stocking mask and the poor light. She described him as \u201cof average height, fairly slender.\u201d He had brown hair and was white, in his \u201clate teens or early twenties.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b704-7\">There was other evidence (a) of conversations at the police station with Robinson, then seventeen years old, after Miranda warnings, in which Robinson described his activities on the night of August 11-12,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and (b) a fingerprint lifted by the police <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>in the victim\u2019s apartment on the day of the assault on the victim which could have been found on police testimony to have been Robinson\u2019s and to have been put there fairly recently.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-5\">Robinson turned over voluntarily to Detective Raymond Richard (see note 2) clothing and a belt which Robinson said he had worn on the night of August 11-12 and which also met the victim\u2019s description of the clothing and a belt worn by her assailant on the night of August 11-12. When told by a police officer that his thumbprint had been found on a screen in the victim\u2019s bedroom window, Robinson stated, \u201cI can\u2019t say I did this and I can\u2019t say I didn\u2019t because of the drugs.\u201d Other testimony is stated in connection with discussion of the issues argued in behalf of Robinson.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b705-6\">\n<em>Discussion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b705-7\">1. Robinson first contends that the trial judge improperly refused to put questions to prospective jurors who admitted some relationship to police officers and to others engaged in an occupation related to law enforcement. In particular, the judge declined to inquire whether the prospective jurors would \u201ctend to believe the testimony of a police officer rather than that of a civilian witness if their testimony differed.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The judge denied a motion for an individual voir dire inquiry (see <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>G. L. c. 234, \u00a7 28) of each prospective juror and put questions to the jury collectively. Two prospective jurors declared \u201cindifferent\u201d by the judge (although individually asked questions by him) were removed by peremptory challenges.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-5\">After Robinson had used all his peremptory challenges, the judge dealt with seating one juror whose husband\u2019s occupations were listed on the juror\u2019s questionnaire as (a) a guard for an armored truck company and as (b) a part-time police officer for a town. Defense counsel pointed this out at a bench conference. The judge denied a defense challenge of the juror for cause and noted Robinson\u2019s objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-6\">In the circumstances, the judge would have been prudent to have inquired more closely of all jurors who acknowledged having relatives engaged in law enforcement. In this instance, although the particular juror apparently participated in final deliberations, no showing was made of prejudice, other than defense counsel\u2019s general suggestion that the juror may have been subject to \u201csome indurated bias that may have crept in over the years of . . . [the juror\u2019s] marriage.\u201d The present case involved no contest of credibility between law enforcement officers and civilian witnesses. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McHugh, </em>17 Mass. App. Ct. 1015, 1016 (1984). Robinson showed no significant risk that the case would be decided \u201con the basis of extraneous issues.\u201d See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sheline, </em>391 Mass. 279, 291 (1984). No abuse of discretion has been established. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Szczuka, </em>391 Mass. 666, 671-672 (1984); Smith, Criminal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 1709 (2d ed. 1983 &amp; Supp. 1986). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lapka, </em>13 Mass. App. Ct. 24, 34-35 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b706-7\">2. Robinson contends that an aspect of the prosecutor\u2019s summation was unfair. Defense counsel had attempted during trial to establish that the police investigation in various respects had been inadequate, incompetent, or deficient. Defense counsel had (as Robinson\u2019s brief admits) \u201crehearsed these [alleged] deficiencies and asked the jury repeatedly to consider the deficiencies as they bore on reasonable doubt.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b706-8\">The prosecutor in his summation argued that the defense argument about police deficiencies was a \u201cred herring\u201d and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>that jury consideration of the adequacy of the police investigation would distract them from the real issue in the case, which was whether Robinson committed the crimes charged. The prosecutor also told the jury that \u201cthere is nothing that we civilians like to do better than second-guess the police. But keep in mind we don\u2019t possess the tools [properly] to ... do that any more than, they possess the tools . . . [here defense counsel objected and the judge allowed the prosecutor to continue] to... second guess us as we perform our various jobs.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b707-5\">Robinson argues that this \u201cdemeaned a... legitimate defense strategy\u201d and told the jury that they did not possess the means to appraise police deficiencies. The defense counsel\u2019s closing argument raised questions to which the prosecutor was entitled to make reasonable reply to offset impressions created by the defense closing. See and compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>DeJesus, </em>17 Mass. App. Ct. 1020, 1021-1022 (1984). The prosecutor reasonably could have felt that undue and unfair emphasis had been placed upon the alleged police deficiencies. The judge, when objection was made to the prosecutor\u2019s argument, may have felt that the argument should not have been interrupted then and that the objection should (or could) be dealt with more appropriately at the close of the arguments and in his charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-6\">In any event, despite the fact that, in the pre-charge bench conference, defense counsel made (as to this part of the charge) only a request for a mistrial based upon all his objections during argument, the judge did give appropriate general corrective instructions at the outset of his charge. He pointed out that the jury \u201calone determine what the true facts are,\u201d that they do this \u201cfrom a full and fair consideration of <em>all </em>the evidence presented in the courtroom\u201d (emphasis supplied), and that they are the judges of the weight to be given to testimony and of the credibility of witnesses. The case seems to us to be more like <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gonzalez, </em>22 Mass. App. Ct. 274, 282 (1986), than like <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kozec, </em>399 Mass. 514, 522-526 (1987). See and compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Simmons, </em>20 Mass. App. Ct. 366, 370-372 (1985). There was no error in the denial of a mistrial or in permitting the prosecutor\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>argument without more comment than was made in the general charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-5\">3. Robinson next argues that the judge erred in not giving limiting instructions concerning Detective Richard\u2019s testimony (see penultimate sentence of note <em>2, </em>supra) about his conversation with Robinson\u2019s younger brother. There was objection by defense counsel followed by a bench conference just prior to the inquiry set out in the margin.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b708-6\">At the time of his interrogation by Detective Richard on August 13, 1984, Robinson was not under arrest. Indeed, he was not arrested until a month later. Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rogers, </em>8 Mass. App. Ct. 469, 473-474 (1979),where the defendant was under arrest and made <em>unequivocal </em>denials in response to police inquiries. It may well have been apparent from Detective Richard\u2019s testimony that he was only restating to Robinson what he (Richard) had said to Robinson (so as to give meaning to Robinson\u2019s <em>equivocal </em>answer). In any event, no limiting instruction was requested at the bench conference which preceded the testimony under discussion (see note 5, <em>supra) </em>or immediately after Detective Richard\u2019s answer. Such a limiting instruction was first requested (after a luncheon recess) at the close of Detective Richard\u2019s direct testimony, when the general course of the testimony had turned to other matters. The judge told counsel to call the matter to his \u201cattention at the close of the case.\u201d The requested limiting instruction was marked for identification. It was given in the judge\u2019s charge (after only one intervening further day of testimony) in essentially the same language counsel had requested.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>It might have been preferable for the judge to give the limiting instruction earlier in the case but that was a matter (affecting management of the trial) within his sound discretion. He did not abuse that discretion. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ferguson, </em>365 Mass. 1, 11 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b709-5\">4. Robinson contends that there was error in sentencing him. He was sentenced to a term of fifteen to eighteen years for aggravated rape and to concurrent lesser terms for breaking and entering and for masked armed robbery. He was then given a consecutive sentence of three to five years for assault and battery by means of a dangerous weapon, to take effect at the termination of the prior concurrent sentences.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> He now contends that the aggravated rape conviction under G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 <em>22(a), </em>as appearing in St. 1980, c. 459, \u00a7 6, might have been based on the assault and battery conviction (G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 15A). The indictment specifically alleged that the sexual intercourse was \u201ccommitted during the commission of an offense defined in G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 15A [assault and battery by means of a dangerous weapon], G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 17 [armed robbery], <em>or </em>[emphasis supplied] G. L. c. 266, \u00a7 17 [breaking and entering a building with intent to commit a felony].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b709-6\">The jury under proper instructions returned separate verdicts convicting Robinson of <em>each </em>of these three other offenses, only one of which was needed to make the rape an aggravated rape under the present \u00a7 <em>22(a).</em><footnotemark><em>7</em></footnotemark><em> </em>We think that the judge was not precluded from selecting one of the offenses (the assault and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>battery charge), and imposing a separate non-concurrent sentence on that offense, relying upon the verdicts of guilty on the other two offenses mentioned in the indictment and also in the present version of c. 265, \u00a7 22(a), as constituting an aggravation of the rape.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-5\">We thus are not forced to determine which of the other sentences was regarded by the jury as constituting the aggravation. See and compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>23 Mass. App. Ct. 716, 720-721 (1987), where only one statutory offense was charged in that indictment (which did not charge \u201cserious bodily injury\u201d) as constituting an aggravation of the rape there considered. Cases involving sentencing for first degree murder which may be based on a jury finding of felony-murder (involving both murder and the felony which may cause it to be murder in the first degree) are distinguishable. Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>381 Mass. 90, 123-126 (1980), where only one underlying felony was charged which might have been the basis of the first degree murder conviction. Any concern about the general language of the <em>Wilson </em>case, at 124-125, we think is removed by <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pennellatore, </em>392 Mass. 382, 390-391 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b710-6\">The separate verdicts on separate offenses in the present case perform essentially the same function which was provided by the jury answers to the special questions in the <em>Pennellatore </em>case.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The separate verdicts made it clear what aggravating violations had been found by the jury to have taken place. In the <em>Pennellatore </em>case (at 390), the court decided that, \u201c[sjince the jury found that two separate, sufficient grounds existed for their first degree murder finding in addition to the felony-murder ground,\u201d earlier decisions (precluding consecutive sentences) could be distinguished. The possibility had existed in the <em>Pennellatore </em>case that felony-murder was the <em>sole </em>basis for a jury verdict of murder in the first degree. When, however, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>the causes for the first degree verdict were ascertained by the special questions (at 391), consecutive sentences could be imposed for offenses determined not to have been necessary to sustain the first degree murder verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-5\">\n<em>Judgments affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b704-8\">The assailant, according to the victim, was wearing a \u201cblack T-shirt with white lettering on it,\u201d blue jeans, \u201cand a [leather] studded belt with an unusual belt buckle .... It was an American flag in some sort of an odd shape.\u201d He was also wearing jockey shorts. In the assailant\u2019s vest she had observed a package of Marlboro cigarettes. There was testimony from Karen Moreland (a friend of Robinson) that she had bought Robinson a package of this brand of cigarettes around midnight on August 11-12.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b704-9\"> From the testimony of various witnesses, especially (a) Detective Richard of the Lynn police (about a conversation with Robinson on August 13), and (b) Karen Moreland, it could have been found that Robinson on the evening of August 11, 1984, had been with some cousins at 33 Witt Street, Lynn. He had taken \u201cthree hits ofTHC\u201d (tetrahydrocannabinol, \u201cthe primary intoxicant in marijuana,\u201d American Heritage Dictionary, 1257 [2d College ed. 1982], described by one witness as \u201ca very powerful drug\u201d). He had driven about Lynn with a friend consuming beer. Then he had gone to Karen Moreland\u2019s house at 263 Curwin Circle about midnight, where he smoked \u201c[a]t least three joints\u201d of marijuana with her. There he had remained until 5:30 a.m. when he had left, after some \u201ckissing and hugging\u201d of his hostess. He went to his home on Rogers Avenue by a route which led him not far from the victim\u2019s apartment. Robinson claimed to have arrived home about 6 a.m. When told by Detective Richard that Robinson\u2019s younger brother had stated that Robinson had arrived home about 7:30 a.m. On August 12, Robinson replied that he \u201ccouldn\u2019t recall because of the drugs he had taken,\u201d and that (after reaching Frank\u2019s Seagrille on his way home) \u201call of a sudden he drew a blank.\u201d Frank\u2019s Seagrille was at a point on his route home reasonably close to the victim\u2019s apartment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b705-8\"> Robinson\u2019s trial counsel tried the case as if it involved misidentification of the intruder and as one in which young men other than Robinson might have had a motive to rape a former occupant of the victim\u2019s first floor apartment. The jury, however, were not required to believe the evidence brought out with this latter purpose. The jury obviously were not materially in doubt on the merits, for they took only one hour and twenty minutes (from 3:10 p.m. to 4:30 p.m.) on February 3,1986, to reach their verdicts.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b705-9\">\u201cThe judge mentioned in one instance that he did not \u201cask that question,\u201d but he had already made inquiry of the particular juror, discovered that the juror was a school principal, accustomed to making decisions, and prepared to act only on the evidence heard in the court room. We do not view the judge\u2019s statement as not recognizing that he had discretion to ask the question.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-10\">The cases of <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ruiz, </em>400 Mass. 214, 215-216 (1987), and <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McFarland, </em>15 Mass. App. Ct. 948, 949 (1983), do not require a trial judge to hear argument on every discretionary issue. It is enough if it is apparent that he knew he was acting on a discretionary matter. A judge (in the process of jury selection) does far better, however, to approach the problems of each case in a non-dogmatic fashion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b708-7\"> The inquiry proceeded as follows: \u201cQ [by the prosecutor] What if anything did you say when . . . Robinson told you that he had gotten home at six o\u2019clock? A [by Detective Richard] At that time, I stated to Mr. Robinson that I had been to his home on the 12th and I had conversation with a young boy there who stated that he was his brother and he stated that Robert was not home at this time and I inquired what time he had arrived home on Sunday morning. The boy stated to me that he arrived home at around seven-thirty a.m. Q What, if anything, did Mr. Robinson say when you told him that? A He stated that he couldn\u2019t recall because of the drugs he had taken. He stated that he had, that he does recall, that he had gone as far as down Holyoke Street, down to Myrtle to Frank\u2019s Seagrille, then all of sudden he drew a blank.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b709-7\"> No change in these sentences was made by the Appellate Division of the Superior Court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b709-8\">The judge\u2019s initial instructions on this point mentioned serious bodily injury as an aggravating factor and listed only two of three possible applicable aggravating offenses: breaking and entering and masked armed robbery. At a bench conference after the charge, the prosecutor asked the judge to add assault and battery to the list of possible aggravating factors. Defense counsel asked the judge to eliminate \u201cserious bodily injury\u201d as an aggravating factor and, in effect, agreed that any of the three other offenses could be the basis for concluding that the rape was aggravated. Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>23 Mass. App. Ct. 716, 718 (1987). The trial judge then, in supplemental instructions, said, \u201cIf you found there was a rape and you found that on <em>any </em>of the other indictments that the defendant is guilty, you may find aggravated rape\u201d (emphasis supplied).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b710-7\"> The practice of putting special questions to juries considering charges of aggravated rape and, specifically, questions as to the reasons for finding such (if they do so find) aggravation, is to be commended. It may greatly simplify deciding whether there has been any improper duplication of sentences.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
