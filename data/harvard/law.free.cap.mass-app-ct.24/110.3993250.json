After answering, the town filed a motion for summary judgment under Mass.R.Civ.P. 56(b), 365 Mass. 824 (1974), which was allowed. The pleadings were not verified, however, and no depositions, answers to interrogatories, or affidavits were filed in support of the motion. Most of the essential allega<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>tians of the complaint were denied in the town\u2019s answer. It is apparent from the record, which includes the briefs that the parties filed with the trial judge in support of or in opposition to the motion, that the judge in essence ruled that the plaintiffs could not recover even if all of their factual allegations were found to be true. The motion was treated, in other words, as if it were a motion under Mass.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6), 365 Mass. 755 (1974), to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim on which relief could be granted. We review the judge\u2019s ruling on that basis, assuming, as we must, the truth of the allegations of the complaint. See 6 Moore\u2019s Federal Practice \u00a7 56.11 [2] (2d ed. 1986); <em>Ercon, Inc. </em>v. <em>Chomerics, Inc., </em>16 Fed. R. Serv. 2d 1372, 1373 (Callaghan) (D. Mass. 1973); Smith &amp; Zobel, Rules Practice \u00a7 12.16 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">Daniel was a student in the Franklin high school class of 1983. In September of 1982, he was appointed editor of the school yearbook. Shortly thereafter, a student who had been graduated in the class of 1982 was discovered to be selling advertising space in the yearbook to local merchants, without authority and with larcenous intent. Daniel was suspected as an accomplice in the fraud, and in the course of the investigation he was removed as editor of the yearbook. When the investigation ended, the school concluded that Daniel had not been involved. The superintendent of schools wrote Daniel a letter to that effect, and the school reinstated him as an editor of the yearbook. Nevertheless certain members of the school\u2019s administration and staff (not named in the complaint), both before and after Daniel\u2019s exoneration, \u201crecklessly disseminated or permitted to be disseminated\u201d allegations of Daniel\u2019s complicity; and when the yearbook was published, it was found to contain hostile comments by yearbook staff members (students, presumably) allegedly carrying the innuendo that Daniel had been party to the fraud.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b134-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>The Tiltons are caught on the horns of a dilemma. If they establish that members of the school staff committed negligent infliction of emotional distress<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>, they lose because they claim no physical harm. <em>Payton </em>v. <em>Abbott Labs., </em>386 Mass. 540, 544-557 (1982). <em>Stockdale </em>v. <em>Bird &amp; Son, </em>399 Mass. 249, 251-252 (1987). <em>Garrity </em>v. <em>Garrity, </em>399 Mass. 367, 369 (1987). If they establish that the school staff committed intentional infliction of emotional distress<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>, they lose because the defense of sovereign immunity has not been waived with respect to that tort by the Massachusetts Tort Claims Act. G. L. c. 258, \u00a7 10(c), appearing in St. 1978, c. 512, \u00a7 15. The Tiltons apparently attempt to escape between the horns by framing their action as one for \u201creckless infliction of emotional distress\u201d, which they contend is a tort distinct from intentional infliction of emotional distress and hence not barred under the Tort Claims Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">We agree with the trial judge\u2019s analysis in rejecting that contention. \u201cReckless\u201d behavior, like \u201cwanton\u201d behavior, has traditionally been treated as a species of intentional behavior, because, by definition, the tortfeasor knew or should have known that harm was the probable outcome of his actions. \u201cThe essence of wanton or reckless conduct is intentional conduct, by way either of commission or of omission where there is a duty to act, which conduct involves a high degree of likelihood that substantial harm will result to another [citations omitted]. Wanton or reckless conduct amounts to what has been variously described as indifference to or disregard of probable consequences to that other [citations omitted] or the rights of that other.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Welansky, </em>316 Mass. 383, 399 (1944). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Papadinis, </em>23 Mass. App. Ct. 570, 574-575 (1987). The reference in G. L. c. 258, \u00a7 10(c), to the tort of \u201cintentional mental distress\u201d refers to the tort first recognized in <em>George </em>v. <em>Jordan Marsh Co., </em>359 Mass. 244 (1971), and later applied in <em>Agis </em>v. <em>Howard Johnson Co., </em>371 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>Mass. 140 (1976) (where it is referred to, at 143, as \u201cthe cause of action for intentional or reckless infliction of emotional distress\u201d), and <em>Simon v. Solomon, </em>385 Mass. 91 (1982) (where it is referred to, at 95 and 97, as the tort of \u201creckless infliction of emotional distress\u201d). See discussions in <em>Payton </em>v. <em>Abbott Labs., </em>386 Mass. at 554-555; <em>American Velodur Metal, Inc. </em>v. <em>Schinabeck, </em>20 Mass. App. Ct. 460, 470 (1985). See also <em>Spring v. Geriatric Authy. of Holyoke, </em>394 Mass. 274,282-286 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">The Tiltons also cannot prevail if their complaint is treated as alleging claims in slander and libel, because these intentional torts are also among those specifically enumerated in \u00a7 10(c) as excepted from the waiver of immunity effected by the Tort Claims Act. We need not reach questions that would be presented otherwise, as to the appropriate role of school officials in censoring student publications and possible First Amendment constraints. As to the application of First Amendment principles to the tort of intentional infliction of emotional distress, see <em>Fleming </em>v. <em>Benzaquin, </em>390 Mass. 175, 189-190 (1983); <em>Godbout v. Cousens, </em>396 Mass. 254, 265 (1985).
