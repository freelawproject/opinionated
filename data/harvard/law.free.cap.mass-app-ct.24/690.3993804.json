Grant &amp; Sons Co., Inc., was found guilty by a jury of six of multiple violations of G. L. c. 131, \u00a7 40, the Wetlands Act.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The violation of the statute charged in the complaint was that the defendant had filled and altered a fresh water wetland which was subject to flooding. A judge of the District Court imposed a fine of $70,000, plus a surfine of $17,500.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>What punishment the Wetlands Act prescribes gives rise to the primary \u2014 and dispositive \u2014 point on appeal. The last paragraph of G. L. c. 131, \u00a7 40, as amended by St. 1974, c. 818, \u00a7 1, provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b713-5\">\u201cWhoever violates any provision of this section shall be punished by a fine of not more than one thousand dollars or by imprisonment for not more than six months or both. Each day or portion thereof of continuing violation shall constitute a separate offense.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b713-6\">In the instant case the jury found that violations of the act persisted from November 3, 1982, to, at least, May 4, 1986. The trial judge calculated the maximum penalty which he might impose under \u00a7 40 on the defendant to be $1,275,000 <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and scaled down from that.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-7\">Section 90 of c. 131 deals generally with penalties for infractions under c. 131. The fifth paragraph of \u00a7 90, as amended by St. 1971, c. 149, provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b713-8\">\u201cWhoever violates any provision of section forty, or of any rule or regulation made under authority thereof, shall be punished by a fine of not less than one hundred dollars nor more than five thousand dollars, or by imprisonment for not more than two years, or both.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b713-9\">It cannot persuasively be argued that \u00a7 90 is a section of general applicability which must yield to the specific provisions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>of \u00a7 40. Section 90 contains thirteen discrete punishment provisions for violations of the various provisions in c. 131, which relates to inland fisheries, game and other natural resources. Paragraph five of \u00a7 90 takes straight and exclusive aim at violations of \u00a7 40. The inconsistency between the punishment which may be visited under \u00a7 40 or \u00a7 90 for the same offense is inescapable and dramatic, e.g., a fine of $1,279,000 versus $5,000; imprisonment for two years versus a ludicrous 639 years and six months. It is similarly implausible to urge that the fifth paragraph of \u00a7 90 should be read as an outer limit on the penalties prescribed in \u00a7 40. No language in \u00a7 90 expresses awareness of the penalty provisions in \u00a7 40. The range of fines set out in \u00a7 90, not less than $100 nor more than $5,000, is indicative of an independent penalty provision rather than one designed to curtail another.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Of the thirteen paragraphs in \u00a7 90, the fifth is the only one which collides with a section that contains its own specific penalties. Six provisions in \u00a7 90 provide a penalty for each specific offense or for each specific violation; the fifth paragraph does not.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-5\">No one, as matter of constitutional due process, may, on pain of loss of liberty, be required to speculate about the meaning of penal statutes. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Batchelder, </em>442 U.S. 114, 123 (1979). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gagnon, </em>387 Mass. 567, 569 (1982). The governing principles were relatively recently set out in the <em>Gagnon </em>opinion at 569: the hypothetical rational person contemplating a violation of law may not be required to guess about punishment any more than about substantive provisions; criminal statutes are construed strictly against the Commonwealth; we may look to outside sources to determine the meaning of a statute whose language is unclear; we indulge every rational presumption in favor of the statute\u2019s validity; but any reasonable lingering doubt as to the meaning of the statute or the intention of the Legislature must be resolved in favor of the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>We have rummaged around in the statutory history of \u00a7\u00a7 40 and 90 but have found nothing useful in resolving the inconsistency between the two sets of penalties. As in the <em>Gagnon </em>case, there is reasonable doubt about what sanction the Legislature intends for violation of \u00a7 40. See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Marrone, </em>387 Mass. 702, 704 (1982); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bongarzone, </em>390 Mass. 326, 334-336 (1983). Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Burgos, </em>390 Mass. 763, 764-765 (1984); <em>Fogelman </em>v. <em>Chatham, </em>15 Mass. App. Ct. 585, 589-590 (1983); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dupree, </em>16 Mass. App. Ct. 600, 605-606 (1983); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Maracic, </em>18 Mass. App. Ct. 722 (1984); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Silva, </em>21 Mass. App. Ct. 536, 540-541 (1986); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Haley, </em>23 Mass. App. Ct. 10, 15-22 (1986). As to its penal provisions, G. L. c. 131, \u00a7 40, read with \u00a7 90, is unconstitutionally vague.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-7\">As of September 23, 1987, the statutory anomaly applicable in this case will cease to exist. By St. 1987, c. 174, \u00a7 21, approved June 25, 1987, the penalty provisions which now appear in G. L. c. 131, \u00a7 90, are deleted. The penalty provisions in G. L. c. 131, \u00a7 40, were amended by \u00a7 19 of the 1987 act, to provide that a person who violates \u00a7 40 \u201c(a) shall be punished by a fine of not more than [$25,000] or by imprisonment for not more than two years, or both such fine and imprisonment; or (b) shall be subject to a civil penalty not to exceed [$25,000] for each violation. Each day such violation continues shall constitute a separate offense.\u201d It has been open, and continues to be so, through equitable proceedings, to secure compliance with the physical strictures of the Wetlands Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-8\">In view of our resolution of the claim of vagueness in the penal provisions of G. L. c. 131, \u00a7\u00a7 40 and 90, as applicable when the complaint in this case was lodged, it is not necessary to consider the other points raised by the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-9\">The judgment under G. L. c. 131, \u00a7\u00a7 40 and 90, is reversed. The corresponding verdict is set aside. The corresponding portion of the complaint against the defendant is to be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-10\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b712-14\"> The complaint also charged the defendant with violating a town by-law that substantially tracks the first paragraph of G. L. c. 131, \u00a7 40. The jury also returned a verdict of guilty on that aspect of the complaint. The trial judge regarded the offense against the town by-law as duplicative and did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>not impose a separate fine. The judge recorded the guilty finding and stated that the case was filed with victim/witness assessments. The town violation is not discussed in the brief of either party. Our opinion does not consider, or bear on, the violation of the town by-law.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b713-11\"> The judge apparently did some slight rounding off. The maximum days of violation to be inferred from the jury\u2019s verdict were 1279. If multiplied by $1,000, the product is $1,279,000. Had an action been lodged against an individual defendant, the statute admits of the dazzling possibility of 639 years and six months of imprisonment. Indeed, an action had been brought against a principal officer of the corporate defendant, but he died early in the litigation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b714-6\"> If $5,000 is the highest penalty payable, it is not a particularly threatening punishment; the economic rewards of violating the law may greatly exceed the fine. For an individual, of course, the threat of two years imprisonment is a forceful deterrent.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
