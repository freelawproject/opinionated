They first applied to the building inspector of Edgar-town for a building permit for a garage. The inspector denied the permit on the ground that the proposed location of the garage would fall within the \u201cshore zone\u201d as defined in art. 14.1 (b)(1) of the zoning by-law of the town.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The plaintiffs did not appeal from the denial of a building permit but sought a special permit for construction of a \u201cboathouse,\u201d a use allowed in the shore zone by special permit of the planning board. The latter denied the special permit.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">The plaintiffs sought review in the Superior Court under G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 17, claiming, inter alla, that their land is exempt from the application of art. 14 by reason of G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 6,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and that in any event the denial by the board was arbitrary and capricious. A judge of the Superior Court, citing <em>Island Properties, Inc. </em>v. <em>Martha\u2019s Vineyard Commn., </em>372 Mass. 216, 217, 228 (1977), held that art. 14 was applicable and that the planning board did not abuse its discretion. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-6\">The parties filed a statement of agreed facts. After the plaintiffs bought their lot and built their house, the Martha\u2019s Vineyard Commission, a regional commission established pursuant to St. 1974, c. 637,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> on December 22, 1975, designated an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>area which included the plaintiffs\u2019 lot as a district of \u201ccritical planning concern\u201d (CPC). As required (c. 637, \u00a7 9), the commission issued guidelines for the district\u2019s development.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">Under c. 637, \u00a7 11, if a town did not enact regulations approved by the commission for CPC districts, the commission itself could adopt regulations applicable to the municipality. For a comprehensive discussion of St. 1974, c. 637, see the <em>Island Properties </em>case, 372 Mass. at 218-222; for a discussion of later enactments see <em>McCarthy </em>v. <em>Planning Bd. of Edgartown, </em>381 Mass. 86, 88 (1980). Edgartown failed to act, and, in 1976, the commission issued regulations for the town. These regulations became part of the Edgartown zoning by-law.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In 1978, pursuant to St. 1977, c. 836, the town withdrew from membership in the commission. The regulations adopted by the commission and incorporated in the town\u2019s zoning by-law were not repealed by the municipality. They continued in effect. <em>McCarthy </em>v. <em>Planning Bd. of Edgartown, </em>381 Mass. at 88-89. In 1981, the town voted to amend certain portions of the zoning by-law which had been issued for it by the commission but did not change the regulations involved here.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b368-6\">On July 1, 1984, Edgartown regained membership in the commission (St. 1984, c. 98, repealing St. 1977, c. 836). Thereafter, on July 20, 1984, the plaintiffs filed their application for a special permit to construct a boathouse. They now appeal from the judgment affirming the denial of the special permit by the planning board.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-7\">1. Recognizing that the <em>Island Properties </em>case, 372 Mass. at 217, held that \u00a7 7A (the provision giving limited protection against subsequent zoning changes, now G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 6) \u201cis not directed to standards and regulations, authorized by the State legislation, having regional or State-wide scope or significance,\u201d the plaintiffs urge that art. 14 is a mere local regulation of the town and not a commission regulation. As such, they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>argue, it is subject to G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 6.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> As stated in the <em>Island Properties </em>case, however, at 228, \u00a7 7A (the predecessor of c. 40A, \u00a7 6), \u201cis not directed to subsequent zoning laws in a general sense, but only to zoning ordinances or by-laws subsequently passed by municipalities in the accustomed and ordinary way.\u201d Justice Kaplan in n.23 went on to say, \u201cThis category does not, in our opinion, include the regulations, compelled by the commission\u2019s guidelines . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">Edgartown, as a consequence of regaining membership in the commission, was required to have a regulation, here exemplified by art. 14, to comply with the commission\u2019s guidelines. St. 1977, c. 831, \u00a7 10, as amended by St. 1979, c. 319, \u00a7 3, and St. 1977, c. 831, \u00a7 20. Whether that article was proposed by the town itself<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> or formulated for it by the commission is of no significance for purposes of c. 40A, \u00a7 6. \u201c[A] CPC district may be designated only when there is a regional need for special regulations or planning to protect the given area,\u201d <em>Island Properties, Inc. </em>v. <em>Martha\u2019s Vineyard Commn., </em>372 Mass. at 223, and where the \u201cpresent public or private regulations in a substantial part of the District cannot assure protection.\u201d Section 1.101 of the commission\u2019s \u201cStandards and Criteria for Districts of Critical Planning Concern,\u201d adopted under the 1974 Act. To nullify the provisions of art. 14 by reason of c. 40A, \u00a7 6, merely because the town, rather than the commission, initiated these regulations compelled by the guidelines would render nugatory the regional or State-wide import of the CPC designation.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>We hold, therefore, that art. 14 of the zoning by-law of Edgartown was applicable to the plaintiffs\u2019 lot when the planning board acted on the plaintiffs\u2019 application. At that time, Edgartown was again a member of the commission.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">2. The planning board acted within its discretion in determining that the proposed boathouse, which was to be attached to the plaintiffs\u2019 house and would not have been adjacent to the water, was not within the intent of the zoning by-law. The plaintiffs had called the storage facility a \u201cgarage\u201d in seeking a building permit; they intended to use the structure for winter storage of other items as well as boats, e.g., for yard furniture and garden equipment; and the boats stored in it were to be hauled overland to a launching site not on the lot. In those circumstances, the board\u2019s denial of the application \u201cfor the reason that the proposed structure does not meet the intent [of the by-law] concerning boathouses as a conditionally permitted use in the fragile shore zone\u201d was not arbitrary or capricious.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-6\">In accordance with note 10 of this opinion, the judgment is modified to read that G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 6, did not affect the applicability of art. 14 to the plaintiffs\u2019 lot at the time the planning board acted, a date after Edgartown regained membership in the commission. As so modified, the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b367-7\"> Article 14.1 (b)(1) established a shore zone which, as relevant here, consists of the land \u201cfrom mean low water to 100 feet inland of the inland edge of any beach or marsh grasses.\u201d The planning board may grant a special permit under art. 14.1 (d) within the shore zone as a conditionally permitted use as provided by \u00a7 13.4(b) which provides in relevant part: \u201cThe Planning Board may grant a Special Permit for the following structures and uses, subject to such special conditions and safeguards as said Board deems necessary to fulfill the purpose of Section 13.1, to assure continued dune stabilization, to maintain the ecological intergrity of beach areas, and to reduce the likelihood of hazards for health or safety.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-8\">1. Non-residential buildings or structures to be used only in conjunction with fishing, shellfishing, the growing, harvesting and storage of crops raised on the premises, and boathouses . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b367-9\"> In certain situations, \u00a7 ,6 has the effect of protecting a lot owner against subsequent zoning changes.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b367-10\"> Chapter 637 of the Acts of 1974 was superseded by St. 1977, c. 831, which, in turn, was amended by St. 1979, c. 319.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b368-8\"> Incorporation of the regulations of the commission into the \u201cofficial ordinances, by-laws, and maps of the municipality\u201d was required by St. 1974, c. 637, \u00a7 11.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b368-9\"> The only change of relevance is that special permits are now granted by the planning board rather than the zoning board of appeals.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b369-6\"> Although we do not reach the question whether the plaintiffs would be protected by G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 6, if art. 14 were merely a local by-law, we note that that result is far from clear. The plaintiffs claim that the establishment of the shore zone increases their \u201cyard\u201d or \u201cdepth\u201d requirement, an increase prohibited by the fourth paragraph of \u00a7 6. This attempt to come within \u00a7 6 is awkward, at best. See the <em>Island Properties </em>case, 372 Mass. at 227 n.22. Their claim that the \u201cboathouse\u201d was an extension of a preexisting nonconforming use is, as the trial judge indicated, an \u201cafterthought.\u201d The plaintiffs\u2019 application to the planning board was not on that basis but, rather, sought a special permit for a boathouse pursuant to art. 14 of the zoning by-law.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b369-7\"> We shall assume with the plaintiffs that the status of the regulation is the same as would have existed had Edgartown itself initially adopted regulations consistent with the commission\u2019s CPC designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b370-8\"> The judgment below declared that art. 14 of the zoning by-law \u201chas been applicable to the plaintiffs\u2019 lot since its adoption.\u201d We, however, express no opinion as to the effect of c. 40A, \u00a7 6, during the period Edgar-town had no representation in the commission.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
