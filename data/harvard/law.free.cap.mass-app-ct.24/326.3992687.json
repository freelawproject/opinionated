The motion judge made extensive and detailed findings which we must accept absent clear error. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gil, </em>393 Mass. 204, 211-212 (1984). Our appellate function, however, requires us to \u201cmake our own independent determination on the correctness of the judge\u2019s \u2018application of constitutional principles to the [subsidiary] facts as found.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Haas, </em>373 Mass. 545, 550 (1977). We find no fault in the reasoning employed or the result reached by the motion judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-14\">The defendant appeared at the police station with his attorney. After a few perfunctory questions, the defendant was advised of his Miranda rights. At that point, the defendant\u2019s attorney informed the police, as he had done earlier, that, although his client would answer any questions pertaining to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>booking, his client did not wish to make any statement concerning the incident under investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">The defendant claims that a statement was obtained later from him by the police in a manner contrary to the requirements of <em>Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436 (1966). The principal allegation is that his right to silence was not scrupulously honored by the police. The United States Supreme Court, as well as the Supreme Judicial Court, has held that statements obtained after a person in custody has decided to remain silent are inadmissible if the police have not \u201cscrupulously honored\u201d an accused\u2019s \u201cright to cut off questioning.\u201d <em>Michigan </em>v. <em>Mosley, </em>423 U.S. 96, 104 (1975). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brant, </em>380 Mass. 876, 882, cert. denied, 449 U.S. 1004 (1980); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mandeville, </em>386 Mass. 393, 402-404 (1982). See generally Smith, Criminal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 360 (2d ed. 1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">The motion judge\u2019s findings, for which there is ample basis in the record, are sufficient to sustain his determination,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> which in our view is correct. We need only cite one such finding in order to dispose of the Commonwealth\u2019s argument on appeal: \u201cThe [challenged] question . . . was asked shortly after the defendant had invoked his right to remain silent, without any significant pause after the defendant had asserted his right.\u201d See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gore, </em>20 Mass. App. Ct. 960 (1985). Compare <em>Michigan </em>v. <em>Mosley, </em>423 U.S. at 106. Contrast <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Tatro, </em>4 Mass. App. Ct. 295, 302-304 (1976); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Andujar, </em>7 Mass. App. Ct. <em>777, </em>783-785 &amp; n.7 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b349-7\">Deciding as we do, we do not think it necessary to respond at length to the defendant\u2019s additional argument that the right to counsel aspect of <em>Miranda </em>also was violated. See and compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Taylor, </em>374 Mass. 426, 435-436 (1978). This issue is adequately disposed of by the judge\u2019s finding that \u201c[t]he officers questioning [the defendant] were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>aware that [his attorney] was not within hearing distance of the area [where] the questioning was taking place.\u201d See in this regard <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brant, </em>8 Mass. App. Ct. 558, 567-568 &amp; n.3, 571-573 &amp; n.8 (1979) (Brown, J., dissenting), <em>S.C., </em>380 Mass. 876 (1980). See also Smith, Criminal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 360, at 258 (2d ed. 1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">\n<em>Order allowing motion to suppress affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b349-8\"> The judge concluded that \u201c[t]he defendant at no time intended to waive his right to remain silent nor did he knowingly and intelligently waive his rights under the \u2018Miranda Decision.\u2019\u201d See <em>Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>384 U.S. at 473-475.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
