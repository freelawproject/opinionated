Answer, a general denial. Trial in the court of common pleas before Hoar, J., who signed this bill of exceptions:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b11-9\">\u201c Mrs. McDermott testified for the plaintiff, that she met the female defendant in the street, who asked her, \u2018 If she had heard the story ? \u2019 to which she answered, \u2018 What story ? \u2019 Defendant replied, \u2018 Nothing less than that Agnes is Mr. Moran\u2019s kept miss.\u2019 Witness replied, \u2018 I do not believe it.\u2019 Defendant said, \u2018 It is all over the glasshouse.\u2019 Witness said, \u2018 That could not be, or her husband would have heard of it, who worked in the glasshouse.\u2019 Defendant said. 1 It was not in the upper, but the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>lower glasshouse.\u2019 The witness further testified that she did not believe the story, or think any worse of the plaintiff for having heard it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b12-5\">\u201c The defendants claimed that no charge of fornication had been made; and that there were such reports current in the community, which the defendant had spoken of, without in any degree sanctioning or confirming them, and offered evidence that such reports were current in the community before the conversation with Mrs. McDermott. To this evidence the plaintiff objected, but the presiding judge admitted it; and instructed the jury, that the substance of the plaintiff\u2019s action was, that the defendant had charged her with a crime; that if the defendant repeated a story defamatory of the plaintiff, conveying to any extent the idea that it was true or that she believed it to be true, it would be a slander; but that if the defendant merely said that there was a story in circulation of the kind set forth in the writ, and did not say so with any purpose or design to extend its circulation, or in any degree to cause the person whom she addressed to believe or suspect the charge which the story imputed to be true, or to add to it any sanction or authority of her own, or to give to it any farther circulation or credit, and it was true that such a story was in circulation, it would not be actionable to say so.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b12-6\">\u201c The other instructions of the court were not excepted to by either party. The jury found a verdict for the plaintiff for \u00a77.29; and the plaintiff, on account of the small amount of damages, excepts to the admission of the evidence above stated.\u201d</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b12-7\"><em>T. D. </em>Eliot, for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b12-8\"><em>G. </em>Marston, for the defendants.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Aut\">The evidence excepted to was properly admitted; because the words charged to have been spoken were susceptible of two constructions, one slanderous, the other not; namely, either that the plaintiff had been guilty of a crime, or that there was such a report. And in such a case the jury are to decide upon the intent, it being matter of fact to be collected from all the concomitant circumstances. <em>Welsh </em>v. Eakle, 7 J. J. Marsh. 424. <em>Davis </em>v. Johnston, 2 Bailey, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>579. <em>Van Vechten </em>v. <em>Hopkins, </em>5 Johns. 221. <em>Dexter </em>v. <em>Taber, </em>12 Johns. 240. <em>M\u2019Kinly </em>v. 20 Johns. 356. <em>Gorham, </em>v. Ives, 2 Wend. 534. <em>Gibson </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>4 Wend. 320. 1 Stark. Sland. 46, 47, 60.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b13-5\">The plaintiff has no ground of exception to the instructions; for the judge expressly directed the jury \u201c that if the defendant repeated a story defamatory of the plaintiff, conveying to any extent the idea that it was true or that she believed it to be true, it would be a slander.\u201d And the jury have found that the words were spoken slanderously, which renders immaterial the definition of the judge as to what would not be actionable.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b13-6\">There was adequate cause for the smallness of the damages ; for the declaration is for words spoken to a particular person, and that person did not believe them, or change her opinion of the plaintiff in consequence of them. The plaintiff was therefore entitled to nominal damages only.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b13-7\">Thomas, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ao\">That an action of slander lies for charging the plaintiff with the crime of fornication is well\" settled. <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Palish, </em>8 Pick. 384. It is a charge of a crime punishable by law, and of a character to degrade and disgrace the plaintiff and exclude her from society. That the words uttered import the commission of the offence cannot be doubted.</p>\n<p id=\"b13-8\">The uttering of the words is a wrongful act, purposely done ; and this is sufficient to constitute legal malice. To prove legal malice it is not necessary to show that the words were uttered from personal enmity or ill will. When the words are uttered, the true measure of damages is the injury caused by the utterance. The \u201c story \u201d uttered or repeated by the defendant contains a charge against the plaintiff of a nature to destroy her reputation. It was a false charge. It is no answer, in any forum, to say, that she only repeated the story as she heard it. \u25a0 If the story was false and slanderous, she must repeat it at her peril. There is safety in no other rule. Often the origin of the slander cannot be traced. If it were, possibly it might be harmless. He who gives it circulation gives it its power of mischief. It is the successive repetitions that do the work. A falsehood often repeated gets to be believed.</p>\n<p id=\"b14-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>We think the instructions of the learned judge were not in conformity to the law, as understood in this Commonwealth. <em>Wolcott </em>v. <em>Hall, </em>6 Mass. 514. <em>Alderman </em>v. French, 1 Pick. 18. <em>Bodwell </em>v. <em>Swan, </em>3 Pick. 376. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Snelling, </em>15 Pick. 337. <em>Stone </em>v. <em>Varney, </em>7 Met. 91. <em>Watson </em>v. <em>Moore, </em>2 Cush. 133. The jury were instructed, that if the defendant merely said there was a report in circulation of the kind set forth in the writ, and did not say so with any design to extend its circulation, or in any degree to cause the person whom she addressed to believe or suspect the charge which the story imputed to be true, or to add to it any sanction or authority of her own, or to give it any further circulation or credit, and it was true that such story was in circulation, it would not be actionable to say so.</p>\n<p id=\"b14-5\">It seems scarcely possible that a story could be repeated by a person of any respectability, under the circumstances and with the results supposed. To say that such a story is current, and to relate it to one before that time ignorant of its existence, necessarily gives it further circulation ; and a party is presumed to know and intend the necessary consequences of his acts.</p>\n<p id=\"b14-6\">And such is the case before us. The witness had never heard of the story, and expresses her disbelief of it. The defendant, so far from expressing a concurrence in the witness\u2019s disbelief, replies, <em>\u201c </em>It (the story) is all over the glasshouse.\u201d And when the witness says this could not be, or her husband, who worked at the glasshouse, would have heard it, the defendant replied, <em>\u201c </em>It was not in the upper, but the lower glasshouse.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b14-7\">The story is related to one before ignorant of it, without giving the person from whom it was received, without expressing any disbelief of it, without any apparent purpose of inquiry as to its truth, and with the assertion, in reply to the disbelief of the witness, of the currency of the report.</p>\n<p id=\"b14-8\">It seems to us that the jury, treating the instructions as applicable to the case before them, may have been misled ; that they may have understood the learned judge to mean that the simple repetition of a slanderous story, without express malice, was not actionable.</p>\n<p id=\"b15-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>But under the limitations stated, if they were possible, we think the rule laid down is not the law. A man cannot say there is a story in circulation that A poisoned his wife, or B picked C\u2019s pocket in the omnibus, or that D has committed adultery, and relate the story, and, when called upon to answer, say, \u201c There was such a story in circulation; I but repeated what I heard, and had no design to circulate it or confirm it; \u201d and for two very plain reasons\u2014that the repetition of the story must, in the nature of things, give it currency; and the repetition, without the expression of disbelief, will confirm it.</p>\n<p id=\"b15-5\">The danger is an obvious one, and long since pointed out; and it is, that bad men may give currency to slanderous reports, and then find in that currency their own protection from the just consequences of a repetition.</p>\n<p id=\"b15-6\">Although the jury, under these instructions, returned a verdict for the plaintiff, yet, from the damages returned, we cannot but believe the instructions of the learned judge, which we think incorrect, must have prejudiced the plaintiff\u2019s cause, and that justice requires she should have a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b15-7\">\n<em>Exceptions sustained.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
