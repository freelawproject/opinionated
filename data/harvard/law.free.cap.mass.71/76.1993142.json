Bryant, Esquire, a justice of the peace in and for the county of Plymouth, William P. Corthell of Abington in the county of Plymouth, on behalf of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, on oath complains that Samuel E. Newell of Abington in the county of Plymouth, on the seventeenth day of August in the year eighteen hundred and fifty three, at Abington in the county of Plymouth, without any authority, appointment, or license therefor, duly made, had and obtained according to law, did unlawfully sell intoxicating liquors to Turner R. Holbrook\u2014the same not being cider sold for other purposes than that of a beverage, and not being the fruit of the vine for the commemoration of the Lord\u2019s Supper\u2014against the peace of said commonwealth, and contrary to the form of the statute in such case made and provided.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b84-7\">The defendant, being convicted by the justice, and again in the court of common pleas, moved in arrest of judgment, 1st, Because this was a criminal process, instead of a civil process. 2d. Because it was not made in behalf of the town of Abington.

The <em>St. </em>of 1852, c. 322, \u00a7 8, provides that \u201c any forfeiture or penalty arising under the seventh section may be recovered in an action of debt, brought in the name of the city or town <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>where the offence was committed, or by complaint before any justice of the peace.\u201d The complaint here intended is a civil process, as appears from its being given as a concurrent remedy with an action of debt; from the provision that \u201c the forfeiture so recovered shall go to the town or city where the convicted party resides ; \u201d and from the provisions of \u00a7 7, by which he is entitled, after two months\u2019 imprisonment, to be discharged as a prisoner committed for debt, and not as a poor convict imprisoned for nonpayment of fines and costs, under Rev. Sts. <em>c. </em>145, \u00a7 3. But if a criminal complaint be intended, this complaint is defective, because it is not made on behalf of the town to which the forfeiture goes, and which is liable for the costs. Common<em>wealth </em>v. <em>Fahey, </em>5 Cush. 408. Rev. Sts. <em>c. </em>121, \u00a7 23.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b85-5\"><em>T. H. Clifford, </em>(Attorney General,) for the Commonwealth.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b85-6\">Metcalf, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A7U\">1. We are of opinion that the complaint on which, by <em>St. </em>1852, <em>c. </em>322, \u00a7 8, the forfeiture for unlawful single sales of liquor may be recovered is a complaint in a criminal process, and should, of course, be in the usual form of complaints in such process. This has been the uniform practice under that statute, and we have rendered many judgments on such complaints.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-7\">2. We are also of opinion that such complaints need not purport to be, nor in fact be, made in behalf of any town. The statute gives the forfeiture to the town where the convicted \u2022party resides, whenever it is sought by action of debt or by complaint; though the forfeiture would go to the Commonwealth if it were recovered by indictment. <em>Taunton </em>v. <em>Sproat, </em>2 Gray, 429. The case is not like those in which a statute authorizes a <em>qui tarn </em>information or action, or a popular action, and gives part of the penalty or damages to him who may prosecute therefor, and the remainder to the Commonwealth, or to some corporation or individual. In such cases, the process should doubtless show, on its face, who is entitled to the fruits of the process. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Baker, </em>2 Gray, 79. It is entirely different in a case like this, where the penalty, when recovered, can go only to a certain town, whoever may complain, or m whose behalf soever the complaint may be made.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-8\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
