Sts. c. 116. The case was submitted to the decision of the court upon the following statement of facts:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b476-10\">The respondents had erected a milldam in Andover across the Shawsheen River, and thereby flowed the land of the petitioner, who granted to them the right to flow his land to the height of certain fixed marks. In 1847 the respondents raised their dam a foot, and thereby flowed the petitioner\u2019s land to a much greater height than they had before flowed, or than they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>had a right to flow it under any grant or agreement. On the 20th of March 1848 the petitioner conveyed the premises to John Marland for $6,000, and took back a mortgage to secure the payment of two thirds of the purchase money. Both the deed and the mortgage contained a covenant \u201c that the premises are free from all incumbrances, excepting so fax as the Ballard Vale Company may have heretofore acquired a right to flow some part of the premisesand the mortgage provided that the mortgagor should retain possession until breach of condition. Marland entered upon the premises, and remained in possession until the 7th March 1850, when the defendants entered for breach of condition, and have since foreclosed. On the 14th of December 1848, Marland, in consideration of $1,000 paid to him &lt; by the respondents, executed a release and quitclaim to them, in fee, of all his right, title, interest and estate in the land, \u201cso far and so high as the same may be flowed by said company\u2019s raising or maintaining their dam as high\u201d as certain marks, fixing the height to which it had been raised in 1847.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b477-5\">This case was argued in writing, and decided at Boston in June 1856.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b477-6\"><em>D.

The owner of land, besides past damages within three years, may have his future annual damages assessed, and also a sum in gross for all future damages; and if he elects to receive and is paid that sum, the mill-owner may continue to flow without paying any further compensation. Rev. Sts. <em>c. </em>116, \u00a7 19-22. The flowing of the land gives the mill-owner no right in the soil, but is only an injury to the possession; and this process is simply to recover money as a compensation for that injury. <em>Seymour </em>v. <em>Carter, 2 </em>Met. 520. <em>Clement </em>v. <em>Durgin, </em>5 Greenl. 9.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b477-8\">The mortgagor in possession is owner of the land, as against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>all the world but the mortgagee; he may maintain actions for injuries to the land, and give releases for all such injuries. <em>Keach </em>v. <em>Hall, </em>1 Smith\u2019s Leading Cas. 293, <em>&amp; notes. </em>2 Cruise Dig.

Upon the statement of facts to which the parties nave agreed, it is clear that the complainant is entitled to recover compensation for the injury to which his estate has thus been subjected; and that a warrant ought to be issued to summon a jury to assess the damages for the three years next preceding the institution of the complaint, and from thence down to the time of the rendition of their verdict; and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>also to ascertain and determine the annual future damages, and what sum would be a just and reasonable compensation for all the damages to be thereafter occasioned by the use of the dam, and for the right of maintaining, keeping it up and using it forever. Rev. Sts. c. 116, \u00a7 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">When the complainant took possession of the premises for breach of the condition contained in the mortgage, his title thereto was perfect against the world, excepting only the right of Marland, the mortgagor, and his assigns, to redeem the same. That right having never been exercised, and being now entirely foreclosed and extinguished, the complainant\u2019s title is complete and unimpeachable. <em>Ritger </em>v. Parker, 8 Cush. 145.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-6\">The respondents have never had any interest in the premisei, except that which they derived from Marland, the mortgagor His deed to them was a mere quitclaim and release of all hi;i right, title and interest in the premises; and these consisted only of the right of redemption, and the right of possession previous to a breach of the condition of the mortgage. Of the forme) the respondents have never availed themselves; and of the latte) they have had the uninterrupted advantage and enjoyment\u2014no claim being made for damages occasioned by the flowing before the time when the complainant entered upon and took possession of the premises for breach of the condition of the mortgage, and to foreclose the right in equity of redemption. The right of the respondents is now superseded by the paramount title of the complainant; and they have therefore no defence to set up against the complaint, and can show no reason why it should not be maintained.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-7\">It has been argued, for the respondents, that a mortgagor in possession has the power and right effectually to release and discharge a mill-owner from all claims for damages which have been or which may be occasioned to the mortgaged premises, either by the past or the future maintenance of the dam, used and to be used forever, for the purpose of raising water to work his mill. Without intending in any degree to sanction that proposition, as a principle of law resulting from a just interpretation of the provision of the statute for the support and regula<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>tion of mills, it is sufficient to say, that the determination of this question is not requisite in this <em>case; </em>for it does not appear that Marland has released or discharged, or even attempted to release or discharge the respondents from all the claims to which they were or might become liable by reason of the maintenance of their dam, and the consequent injury to the complainant\u2019s land by overflowing it with water. It is true that, while he was in possession of the premises, he made a deed to them, granting, releasing and quitclaiming all his right, title, interest and estate in the land. But this was only a conveyance of the interest of the mortgagor in the land, and did not purport to be a relinquishment of any claim for compensation, even for the injury which he himself had sustained; much less for that which might be done to the right and interest of the mortgagee, whose title to the estate was superior and paramount to his own.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-5\">Before the conveyance to Marland, the respondents had acquired, by an absolute grant from the complainant, the unconditional right of flowing the premises by raising their first dam to certain fixed marks. It is to this right that the exception in the covenants in the complainant\u2019s deed to Marland must, upon the facts stated by the parties, be construed as referring. This is the only license ever given by the complainant. It is a mistake to suppose that, by his deed to Marland, he conceded or conveyed to the respondents the further privilege of flowing all the land which was then in fact overflowed and covered with water, without their making compensation therefor according to law. There is nothing in the instrument to indicate any such purpose or intention. Sometimes a grant or conveyance is held to have the effect of a covenant by way of estoppel; but no such consequence has ever been attributed, or is attributable, to a refusal to enter into a covenant, or to assume the obligations of a warranty, against either an alleged or a possible incumbrance. By such refusal the complainant conferred no rights upon others, nor surrendered any upon which, in his own behalf, he had a right to insist.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-6\">\n<em>Warrant for a jury to issue.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
