But upon the authorities cited, we are of opinion that the protection extends to all legal tribunals of a judicial character, whether strictly courts of record or not, recognized by the laws of the State, and having power to pass upon the rights of persons attending them.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-10\">\n<em>Prisoner discharged.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
