It is a general rule, that the name of the prosecutor, or of any third person, must be set out correctly. The only exceptions are in peculiar cases; when property has been taken feloniously, which is capable of identification ; when a stranger is killed or injured, and his name cannot be ascertained; when a person known is so mutilated or decayed as not to be recognizable; when the nature of the crime consists in a series of offences of one kind, and notorious in their character. The propriety of \u201c <em>quendam ignotum </em>\u201d is a question of law, depending in each case on the nature of the offence charged. At least, he should be described, and an averment inserted that due diligence was used to discover his name. 2 Hawk. <em>c. </em>25, \u00a7 71. <em>Buckley </em>v. Thomas, Plow. 129. Lamb. Eiren. 386. 1 Archb. Crim. Pl. (Waterman\u2019s ed.) 79-82 <em>&amp; notes.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b491-10\">2. The complaint does not afiege whether this offence was in violation of <em>St. </em>1852, <em>c. </em>322, \u00a7 7, or of <em>St. </em>1855, <em>c. </em>215, \u00a7 15 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>Both statutes were in force, by virtue of <em>St. </em>1855, <em>c. </em>215, \u00a7 89. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Edwards, 4 Gray, 6. The time alleged does not determine this; for the allegation of time is, to all intents and purposes, immaterial and technical; except when the time is an essential part of the offence, as in burglary. <em>People </em>v. <em>Van Sanivoord, </em>9 Cow. 655, and cases cited. <em>Townly\u2019s case, </em>Foster, 7. <em>Balmerino\u2019s case, </em>Foster, 9, <em>note. </em>The allegation \u201c against the form of the statutes,\u201d seeming to imply, by the plural word, that the offence was in violation of <em>St. </em>1852 as well as of <em>St. </em>1855, has no such legal effect. <em>West\u2019s case, </em>Owen, 135. <em>Andrew </em>v. <em>Hundred de Lewkner, </em>Velv. 116. <em>Butman\u2019s case, </em>8 Greenl. 113, and cases cited. 2 Hale P. C. 173. The court cannot know, from this record, under which statute to pass sentence.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b492-5\">3. The statute of 1855, <em>c. </em>215, \u00a7\u00a7 15, 34, is a violation of the eighth article of amendments of the Constitution of the United States, and of art. 26 of the Declaration of Rights, each of which declares that excessive bail shall not be required, nor excessive fines imposed, nor cruel or unusual punishments inflicted. See Story on U. S. Const. \u00a7 1903 <em>&amp; notes.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b492-6\">4. These sections are not \u201c wholesome and reasonable \u201d laws, within the meaning of the Constitution of Massachusetts, <em>c. </em>1, \u00a7 1, art. 4. Whether they are reasonable or not is a question to be determined by the judiciary, and not by the legislature.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b492-8\">5. The statutes of 1852, c. 322, and 1855, <em>c. </em>215, are contrary to the law of nature, in declaring acts to be crimes which are not criminal, and are therefore void, and must be so declared by the court. <em>Day </em>v. <em>Savadge, </em>Hob. 87. <em>Ross\u2019s case, </em>2 Pick. 169. <em>Kendall </em>v.

The description of a person other than <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>the defendant, in an indictment or complaint, as \u201c a person unknown,\u201d is sufficient, without further averment, if such person be not actually known. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Morse, 14 Mass. 218. 2 East P. C. 651, 751. The sufficiency of such description in a case like the present was distinctly affirmed by this court in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Hendrie, 2 Gray, 504.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">2. Although the averment of time, in an indictment or complaint, is purely technical, and need not correspond with the evidence on the trial; still, on a motion in arrest of judgment, that fact, like all others, is to be taken to be truly stated. As the. <em>St. </em>of 1855, c. 215, \u00a7 39, which took effect on the 20th of May 1855, repealed all previous acts inconsistent with its provisions, saving only existing rights and liabilities, and pending actions and prosecutions, this complaint, by setting forth an unlawful sale of intoxicating liquor on the 1st of June 1855, well charges a n offence against <em>St. </em>1855, c. 215, \u00a7 15. And alleging the offence ta be contrary to <em>\u201c </em>the statutes \u201d in such cases made and provided, i s no ground for arresting judgment. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hooper, </em>5 Pick. 42.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">3. It has been established by the highest authority that those amendments of the Constitution of the United States, which contain no expression indicative of an intention to apply them to the state governments, are restrictions upon the government of the United States only. <em>Barron </em>v. <em>Mayor &amp;c. of Baltimore, 7 </em>Pet. 243. And this doctrine has been applied by the courts of New York and Pennsylvania to the very amendment now in question. <em>Barker </em>v. People, 3 Cow. 686. <em>James </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>12 S. &amp; R. 221.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-7\">4. It is also well settled that when part of a statute is unconstitutional, that will not authorize the court to declare the remainder of the statute void, unless all the provisions are connected in subject matter, depending on each other, operating together for the same purpose, or otherwise so connected in meaning, that it cannot be presumed that the legislature would have passed one without the other. <em>Wellington, petitioner, </em>16 Pick. 95. <em>Fisher </em>v. <em>McGirr, </em>1 Gray, 1. <em>Warren </em>v. <em>Mayor </em>&amp; <em>Aldermen of Charlestown, </em>2 Gray, 84. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Clapp, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number><em>ante, </em>100. The constitutional and the unconstitutional provisions may even be contained in the same section, and yet be perfectly distinct and separable, so that the first may stand, though the last fall. The point is not whether they are contained in the same section, for the distribution into sections is purely artificial; but whether they are essentially and inseparably connected in substance.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">As this defendant stands convicted only of one offence under the <em>St. </em>of 1855, c. 215, \u00a7 15, the only question to' be considered by the court in this case is, whether that part of the statute is unconstitutional, which subjects a person making a single unlawful sale of intoxicating liquor, for a first offence, to the payment of a fine of ten dollars and costs of prosecution, and imprisonment in the house of correction not less than twenty nor more than thirty days. These are clearly not cruel or unusual punishments. They are the lightest punishments known to our law; and have been constantly applied to similar offences. The question whether the punishment is too severe, and disproportionate to the offence, is for the legislature to determine.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-6\">The constitutionality and validity of this section of the statute, as well as of that imposing heavier penalties on a common seller of intoxicating liquors, have been affirmed upon the present circuit. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Clapp, ante, </em>100.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-7\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled</em>\n<footnotemark>\n<em>*</em>\n</footnotemark>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b494-8\"> A similar decision was made in Berkshire, September term 1857.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-9\">Commonwealth <em>v. </em>Ctjbtis Pomeboy &amp; another.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-10\">Indictment on <em>St. </em>1855, e. 215, \u00a7 17, for being a common seller of intoxicating liquors. The defendants, at the trial in the court of common pleas, before <em>Morris, </em>J., requested the judge to instruct the jury \u201c that said statute of 1855, e. 215, upon which this indictment is founded, and said seventeenth section of said statute, upon which this indictment is founded, and especially in connection with the fifteenth and thirty-third sections of said statute, are unconstitutional and void; because they are in conflict with the eighth article of the amendments of the Constitution of the United States, and also with the twenty-sixth article of the Declaration of Rights in the Constitution of Massachusetts, because they require excessive bail or sureties, impose excessive fines, and inflict cruel and unusual punishments.\u201d But the judge refused so to instruct. The defendants, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>being found guilty, moved in arrest of judgment for the same cause, and that motion being also overruled, alleged exceptions, which were overruled by this court, for the reasons stated in the principal case.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-11\"><em>J.
