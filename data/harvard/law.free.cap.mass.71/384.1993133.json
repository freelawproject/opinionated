The applicant was a widow, whose only title was a life estate under the will of her husband, which contained no disposition of the remainder; and he left two children, not named in the will; but they had never, during the twelve years that had elapsed since the probate of the will, of which six had passed before the application for insurance, claimed, under the Rev.

The defendants, a mutual fire insurance company, having expressly stated their intention to rely upon their statute lien, had the right to dispute the correctness of the plaintiff\u2019s representation of her title to the land. Rev. Sts. c. 37, \u00a7 36. <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>28 Maine, 252. <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Bowditch Mutual Fire Ins. Co. </em>6 Cush. 448. <em>Clark </em>v. <em>New England Mutual Fire Ins. Co. </em>6 Cush. 348. The question being material, and properly raised, the plaintiff was bound to try it in this suit. Her title was derived confessedly from the will of her husband, and therefore depends on the legal effect of that will. If the omission to name his children was not intentional, they took by descent, and without any act of theirs, the whole estate, subject only to the plaintiff\u2019s right of dower. Rev. Sts. <em>c. </em>62, \u00a7 21; <em>c. </em>61, \u00a7 1. If such omission was intentional, still the terms of the will gave her only a life estate; and so her representation, that she was the owner, was materially false, and induced the defendants to suppose that they had a lien on the fee.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b394-7\">2 The meaning of the words,11 with fifty feet,\u201d should have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>been submitted to the jury. 2 Parsons on Con. 4, <em>note. </em>Neil<em>son </em>v. <em>Harford, </em>8 M. &amp; W. 823. <em>Hutchinson </em>v. <em>Bowker, </em>5 M. &amp; W. 542. But if they are to be construed by the court, their ti-ue meaning is, \u201c with fifty feet between,\u201d or \u201c intervening.\u201d This gives them a meaning exactly responsive to the question, which calls for \u201c relative situation as to other buildings.\u201d It is the only construction which gives any effective meaning to the words, and is therefore to be adopted. 2 Parsons on Con. 12, <em>note. Schuylkill Navigation Co. </em>v. <em>Moore, </em>2 Whart. 491. <em>Eaton </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>20 Pick. 150. <em>Gunnison </em>v. <em>Bancroft, </em>11 Verm. 493. Angell on Ins. \u00a7\u00a7 176-178. If the meaning be doubtful, the words of the plaintiff should be construed most strongly against her. <em>Melvin </em>v. <em>Locks &amp; Canals on Merrimack River, </em>5 Met. 27. 2 Parsons on Con. 18, <em>note. </em>If the defendants had understood \u201c with \u201d to be written by mistake instead of \u201c within,\u201d they would have required a more specific answer. The introduction, however innocently, of words which have a natural tendency to mislead the insurers, is such a misrepresentation as will avoid the policy.

Dana, Jr. &amp; S. H. Phillips, </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b395-6\">Thomas, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AMC\">This is an action of contract upon a policy of insurance. The issuing of the policy and the loss by fire within the time were conceded. The defence rested upon alleged misrepresentations in the application of the plaintiff for insurance : first, as to her title to the land upon which the house stood; and, secondly, as to the relative situation of the house to other buildings.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-7\">1. As to her title to the land. The policy is made subject to the lien upon the buildings and the land under them, created by the Rev. Sts. c. 37, \u00a7 36. In <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Bowditch Mutual Fire Ins. Co. </em>6 Cush. 418, it was settled that, in the case of mutual insurance companies, whose policies are issued subject to this lien, a false representation by the insured, as t\u00f3 his title, will avoid the policy. In that case, it is to be observed, the plaintiff had no legal title to the property, to which a lien could attach; he had only a bond for a deed. By the seventeenth article of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>by-laws of the Bowditch Insurance Company it is provided, that any policy issued by the company shall be void unless the true title of the assured shall be expressed in the proposal or application for insurance. 6 Cush. 449. This contract of insurance contains no such provision ; and the doctrine of that case is certainly not to be extended.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">The case of <em>Davenport </em>v. <em>New England Mutual Fire Ins. Co. </em>6 Cush. 340, stands upon a distinct ground, the giving an entirely false answer to a material question. It is to be regretted that the report of that case is somewhat imperfect.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-6\">The question asked in this application is : <em>\u201c </em>Do you own the land on which the buildings stand ? \u201d <em>Answer. </em>\u201c Yes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b396-7\">The plaintiff derived her title from the will of her husband, which was admitted to probate six years before the plaintiff\u2019s application. Under this will, upon its face, the plaintiff took an estate for life in the subject of insurance.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-8\">But the defendants offered to show that the testator left two children; and claimed that the children, not being provided for in the will, took, under the Rev. Sts. c. 62, \u00a7 21, the same estate as if their father had died intestate, which, under <em>c. </em>61, \u00a7 1, would be the entire real estate, subject only to the dower of the widow; and that therefore the only title of the plaintiff in the premises insured was a right of dower.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-9\">To this view the objection is twofold: first, it is by no means certain that the provisions of Rev. Sts. <em>c. </em>62, \u00a7 21, would apply to a will like this, where but a life estate is devised, and the reversion, as a legal result, goes to the children; secondly, it is not for the defendants, for the purpose of impeaching the title of the plaintiff, to do what the children had never done, although some twelve years had elapsed. If any one can disturb her title, they only can. The plaintiff was then in the possession of the estate under an apparently good title of freehold, which the only persons interested had never sought to defeat, if they had the power.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-10\">In saying, then, she owned the land, was the representation substantially true, so far as the fact was within her knowledge ?</p>\n<p id=\"b396-11\">The owner of a freehold, in common parlance, as well as undei <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>the law, is regarded as the owner of the estate. See the pauper law, Rev. Sts. <em>c. </em>45, \u00a7 1, <em>cl. </em>4, 5; the tax act, Rev. Sts. <em>c. </em>7, \u00a7 7; the mill act, Rev. Sts. <em>c. </em>116, \u00a7 24. These views seem to be fully sustained by the case of <em>Curry </em>v. <em>Commonwealth Ins. Co. </em>10 Pick. 535.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">The answer is substantially true; and we cannot think parties applying for insurance are called upon to settle, with very great precision, questions of title. The plaintiff\u2019s title gave the defendants a lien, though limited to the life of the insured.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">2. The representation of the relative situation as to other buildings. The question was : \u201c Relative situation as to other buildings ? \u201d The answer was: \u201c A dwelling-house and cabinetmaker\u2019s shop <em>with </em>fifty feet.\u201d There was a cabinet shop two feet from the property insured. The defendants contended that the answer implied that the shop was at the distance of fifty feet; that fifty feet intervened. The judge held that the true construction of the answer was, that the buildings were <em>within </em>fifty feet.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-7\">It was a question for the court, being the construction of a written instrument, where no question arose as to the use of words of art. It was the correct construction. It is quite common, in an application, to inquire what buildings are within fifty feet of the building to be insured. The answer is correct, as far as it goes. If the defendants desired a more precise one, they should have sought it by additional inquiries.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-8\">Contracts for fire insurance are often made by persons but little acquainted with legal forms. They are practical business contracts, to be fairly but liberally construed. The extreme doctrine of literal warranty has not been and should not be applied to them. They are not to be held upon the apices of the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-9\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
