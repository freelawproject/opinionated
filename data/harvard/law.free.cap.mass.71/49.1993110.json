The court of common pleas discharged the trustees, and gave judgment for the claimants, and the plaintiff appealed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b58-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number><em>E. H. </em>Bennett, for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ach\">The trustees must be charged. The defendant, being at work by the day only and without any contract for the future, had at the time of the assignment no assignable interest in his future earnings. <em>Mulhall </em>v. <em>Quinn, </em>1 Gray, 105. The order was not an assignment to the claimants, but only an authority to pay to them. <em>Carrique </em>v. <em>Sidebottom, </em>3 Met. 297. There was no consideration for the order; as it does not appear that the trustees ever did advance any thing to the defendant under it.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b58-5\"><em>J. Brown, </em>for the trustees and claimants.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b58-6\">Thomas, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Aj3\">This case is settled by the recent decision of this court in <em>Hartley </em>v. <em>Tapley, </em>2 Gray, 565. The assignment made to the claimants was of wages to be earned under an engagement then existing, for an agreed price, payable at fixed periods of time; an agreement under which the defendant had been employed for ten years, and was at the time of the assignment actually at work.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-7\">It is clearly distinguished from the case of <em>Mulhall </em>v. <em>Quinn, </em>1 Gray, 105. In that case there was no existing contract or engagement for labor at the time the assignment was made.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-8\">It is not within the principle settled in <em>Carrique </em>v. <em>Sidebottom, </em>3 Met. 297; because the order upon which the claimants rely was for a good consideration, recently made, for a definite sum, to result from a then existing engagement, and was accepted by the company.</p>\n<p id=\"A5_\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n<footnotemark>\n<em>*</em>\n</footnotemark>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b58-9\"> A similar decision was made at Taunton, October term 1856, in the case of Benjamin B. Taylor <em>vs. </em>Dennis Collins &amp; Trustees, argued by the same counsel, the facts of which were precisely similar, except tnat the record of the court of common pleas showed that the claimants, after being admitted as a party to the suit, were defaulted, before the trustees were discharged. The plaintiff appealed, and contended that the claimants having failed to maintain their claim, the trustees were under no legal liability to pay the funds to them, and must therefore be held liable to the plaintiff. But the court, on the authority of <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Lynch, Discharged the trustees.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
