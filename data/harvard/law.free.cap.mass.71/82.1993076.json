Sts. <em>c. </em>126, \u00a7 <em>20, </em>and averring that the defendant at New Bed-ford, on the 27th of March 1855, certain pieces of cloth, and articles of wearing apparel, (described,) <em>\u201c </em>of the goods and chattels of one Benjamin P. Howland and of one Preserved Bullock, copartners under the firm of Howland and Bullock, by some person or persons to the said jurors unknown, then lately before stolen of the said Howland and Bullock, unlawfully, unjustly, and for the sake of unlawful and wicked gain, did receive and have, the said Edward Lakeman then and there well knowing the same to have been feloniously stolen, against the peace,\u201d &amp;c</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b90-8\">The defendant, being convicted on this count, moved in arrest of judgment for the following reasons\u201c 1st. Because of the insufficiency of the indictment, it containing no averment, in the count for receiving stolen goods, upon which conviction was had, properly setting out a larceny from Howland and Bullock. 2d. Because there is no sufficient averment in said count, in law setting out a knowledge by him of the larceny.\u201d <em>Banger, </em>J. overruled the motion, and the defendant appealed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b90-9\"><em>T.

The forms of indictment, against a party for receiving stolen goods knowing them to be stolen are not uniform as to the allegations in reference to which the present exception is taken. In some of the precedents, and more especially those charging the larceny as committed by another person, in one count, and in a subsequent one charging the defendant with receiving stolen goods, the technical form has more usually been adopted of alleging the goods \u201c to have been feloniously stolen, taken and earned away,\u201d and that the defendant well knew the same to have been \u201c feloniously stolen, taken and carried away.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b91-5\">But in indictments against the receiver only, and where the principal has not been convicted, precedents may be found, corresponding with the allegations in the present indictment, using only the words \u201cknowing the same to have been feloniously stolen.\u201d The same technical particularity is not required in stating the larceny, in an indictment against one charged as a receiver of stolen goods, as would be required in an indictment against the party charged with committing the larceny. 3 Chit Crim.
