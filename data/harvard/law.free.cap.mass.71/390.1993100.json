Clapp from the 1st of December 1848 to the 1st of December 1854.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b398-7\">The parties submitted the case to the decision of the court upon the following facts: Clapp\u2019s legal settlement was and is in Easthampton. In 1845, while temporarily residing in Andover, he became insane, and was committed by the judge of probate to said hospital, and has since remained there. From the time of his commitment until the 1st of December 3852, he was sup posed to be a state pauper, and his expenses were charged to and paid by the State. But on the adjustment with the State by the hospital, in 1854, of the accounts for 1853, the amount thus paid was reallowed to the State, and said expenses charged to the plaintiffs, and payment thereof demanded of them by the treasurer of the hospital on the 2d of June 1854, and paid on the 2d of December 1854. On the 4th of December 1854 the plaintiffs gave due notice thereof to the defendants, and demanded reimbursement.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b398-8\"><em>M.

The payment by the Commonwealth for those four years was at least \u201c sufficient security to the satisfaction of the trustees,\u201d within the meaning of Rev. Sts. <em>c. </em>48, \u00a7 9. And that payment, if made gratuitously by the Commonwealth, when the proofs of the place of settlement were alike accessible to all, cannot be disclaimed, waived or renounced, for the purpose of charging East hampton.</p>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b399-5\">The \u201c like rights and remedies, to recover such sums, as if such expenses had been incurred in the ordinary support of a lunatic,\u201d are limited by Rev. Sts. <em>c. </em>46, \u00a7 13, to expenses \u201c incurred within three months next before notice given to the town to be charged; \u201d and Andover incurred the expenses, if at all, when payment was demanded by the treasurer of the hospital; for then her liability became fixed. <em>Worcester </em>v. <em>Milford, </em>18 Pick. 384. The <em>St. </em>of 1841, <em>c. </em>77, has not dispensed with the necessity of giving notice within three months after incurring the liability. Cumm<em>ington </em>v. <em>Wareham, </em>9 Cush. 585. The reasons for promptness in making inquiries for the purpose of charging other towns, apply as well to cases of lunatics as of other paupers. See <em>East Sudbury </em>v. <em>Sudbury, 12 </em>Pick. 5. The reason given in <em>Worcester </em>v. <em>Milford, </em>18 Pick. 383, that the town of temporary residence may have no notice of the commitment, is taken away by Rev. Sts. <em>c. </em>48, \u00a7 7, requiring such notice. And the construction contended for by the defendants is in analogy to Rev. Sts. <em>c. </em>48, \u00a7 16.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b399-6\">Metcalf, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A3h\">It is necessary to the decision of this case that several statutes should be examined, and the effect of their combined provisions be ascertained.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-7\">By the Rev. Sts. <em>c. </em>48, \u00a7\u00a7 9,10, and <em>St. </em>1837, <em>c. </em>228, \u00a7 7, the expenses of supporting lunatics committed to the hospital at Worcester shall be paid by the town in which they had their residence at the time of their commitment, if they had a settlement within the Commonwealth;' and the town that pays such expenses shall have the like rights and remedies to recover the sums so paid, with interest and costs, as if such expenses had been- incurred in the ordinary support of the lunatics. These <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>rights and remedies, in cases \"of ordinary support, are prescribed (so fax as concerns this case) by the Rev. Sts. <em>c. </em>46, \u00a7 13, where it is provided that a town, which shall furnish support to a poor person having a settlement in another town, may recover of that town the expense which was incurred for that support within three months next before notice thereof given to that town, by action at law instituted within two years after such cause of action shall have arisen, and not otherwise. By <em>St. </em>1841, c. 77, \u201cwhenever any lunatic or insane person shall be committed to the State Lunatic Hospital at Worcester, from any town wherein he has not a legal settlement, and such town shall pay the expense of his support at said hospital, such town may recover from the town in which he has a legal settlement the full amount of all the expense so paid to said hospital.\u201d In an action for such recovery, it was decided in <em>Cummington </em>v. <em>War</em>eham, 9 Cush. 585, that the plaintiffs are bound by the provisions of Rev. Sts. <em>c. </em>46, \u00a7 13, as to notice to the defendants and limitation of the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">When the lunatic, in this case, was committed to the hospital, his residence was in Andover, and his settlement in Easthampton. Andover was therefore liable for his support at the hospital. But the fact, that be had such settlement, was not known until after most of the expense of that support had been incurred ; and, for that reason, Andover was not called on by the officers of the hospital, for payment of that expense, until June 1854. On the 2d of December 1854, Andover paid to the treasurer of the hospital the expense incurred between December 1st 1848 and June 1st 1854, and, on the 4th of that month, gave due notice to Easthampton, and demanded reimbursement. On refusal by that town, this action was commenced on the 17th of March 1855.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">It is to be noticed here that, by Rev. Sts. c. 46, \u00a7 13, the claim which the hospital made on Andover was not barred by the statute of limitations; that claim being only for the expense incurred within six years.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-7\">On this state of the law and the facts, the court are of opinion that the plaintiffs are entitled to recover then full claim, with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>interest and costs. They paid to the hospital what the law required them to pay, and no more. They gave notice to the defendants, according to the Rev. Sts. c. 46, \u00a7 13, of the expense incurred by them, within three months next before the notice, and commenced this action within two years after their cause of action had arisen. They incurred that expense when they paid the hospital, and not before. <em>Judgment for the plaintiffs</em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b401-9\"> A like decision was made, upon similar facts, in a subsequent case, of Citt of Worcester <em>vs. </em>Inhabitants of Sterling, Worcester, September term 1856.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-10\"><em>P.
