Richardson, </em>for the respondent.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AQO\">The mother, on the death of the father, is entitled to control the minor children, and bound to support them, unless she has parted with the right. <em>Dedham </em>v. <em>Natick, </em>16 Mass. 140. <em>Nightingale </em>v. <em>Withington, </em>15 Mass. 274. \u2022 The court will not take the daughter from her mother and natural guardian, without clear proof that, by the laws of Connecticut, such an indenture as this confers rights adverse to those of the mother. The statutes of Connecticut provide, that \u201c the fathers and guardians of minors' may bind them by deed or indenture, as apprentices, to learn some trade or profession, with the assent of such minor expressed in the indenture by subscribing the same.\u201d Sts. of Conn. (ed. of 1854,) 394, 395. This indenture was not executed by \u201c father or guardian ; \u201d for, if \u201c guardian \u201d would include natural guardian, the addition of \u201c father \u201d was unnecessary. It does not bind the minor to learn any trade or profession; and it is not executed by the minor. If the mother breaks this indenture, she may be liable in damages; but it cannot be specifically enforced by <em>habeas corpus.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b544-7\">Nor can the appointment of Fairbank, in Connecticut, as guardian, give him the right to the custody of the child, without proof that, by the law of that state, he has the right to take the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>child out of the custody of her parent into his own custody. By the statutes of Massachusetts, the guardian of a minor has not that right. Rev. Sts. e. 79, \u00a7 4.</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b545-5\">The chief justice, after interrogating the child as to her wishes, delivered the following opinion :</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b545-6\">Shaw, C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"Akq\">This is not a question of mere property\u2014 whether the mother or Fairbank is entitled to the earnings of the minor. But the interest of the minor is the principal thing to be considered. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hammond, </em>10 Pick. 274. We are relieved from the necessity of going into the question, how far the indenture is valid and binding upon the minor under the laws of Connecticut. The only question is, how far it affects the mother\u2019s rights. And the court are all of opinion that, so far as the rights of the mother are concerned, she has relinquished them by this instrument, which operates either as a contract or an estoppel\u2014and it is immaterial which\u2014to prevent her from now setting up her rights. If the child should object, we should be obliged to regard the provisions of the indenture with greater care, and ascertain its legal force and effect in Connecticut, where it was made, and in which state apparently the parties had their domicil.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-7\">In all cases of this description, of the right to the custody and control of a female of an age to have a will, and a capacity to form some judgment for herself, it is the established custom of the court to ascertain the opinion or inclination of the minor. The weight of this depends on the minor\u2019s maturity of mind and capacity to judge. We are satisfied, by an examination, that this girl is capable of judging what will best promote her own welfare, and that she came into Massachusetts on a visit; that she was taken from the friends and associates under whose care and protection she came, clandestinely and forcibly, by her mother, with some assistance; that she is strongly inclined to remain with the society of Shakers; and that they take sufficient care of her education. We are therefore of opinion that she be discharged from the custody and restraint of her mother, and be at liberty to go, if she pleases, with her guardian appointed under the laws of Connecticut.</p>\n<p id=\"Agu\">\n<em>Ordered accordingly-</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
