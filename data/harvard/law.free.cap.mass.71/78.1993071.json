Hood on a complaint for maliciously burning a ship on the stocks, that, soon after the ship was on fire, Brady saw a person come out of the ship and run away, who, to the best of his opinion, was said Hood. Trial in the court of common pleas before Sanger, J., who signed a bill of exceptions, one point in which was thus stated :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b86-7\"><em>\u201c </em>From the evidence in the case, the defendant\u2019s counsel argued to the jury that the testimony showed that at the time and place and under the circumstances testified to by the defendant, as set forth in the indictment, the defendant did see either a person who was William P. Hood, or one whom he then and there had reason to believe to be, and whom he honestly did believe to be William P. Hood; and thereupon he requested the court to instruct the jury that if they found that the defendant did see any one at the time and place and under the circumstances testified to by him, as set forth\" in the indictment, and in fact it was not William P. Hood, then the government must satisfy the jury, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the defendant, at the time of giving his testimony, well knew that such person was not William P. Hood, or that he did not honestly believe it to have been William P. Hood.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b86-8\">\u201c The court declined so to rule, but did instruct the jury, in relation to this branch of the case, that if they were satisfied upon the evidence, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the defendant did give the testimony as charged in the indictment, and that he did not in fact see William P. Hood, and that if, in giving such testimony, he either knew that he did not there see William P. Hood, or rashly swore in this respect to what he had no reasonable or probable cause to believe to be true, they should find him guilty.\u201d</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b87-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number><em>W.

Hood. In regard to the latter statement of the witness, we think the rule stated by the presiding judge at the trial was not sufficiently favorable to the defendant. However proper it might have been as to a matter of fact to which the witness had testified absolutely, yet it would be too stringent a rule to apply to a matter of opinion. A party is not to be convicted of perjury because, in the opinion of the jury, he had no reasonable cause for the opinion he expressed. If, in his own mode of reasoning upon the facts occurring before him, he thought the person who left the ship was William P. Hood, though he might reason very poorly, and upon data which the jury might think very unsatisfactory, yet his testimony would not be wilfully false.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-8\">We do not mean to impugn the doctrine, that a person may be indicted for perjury in swearing that he believed a fact to be true which he must have known to be false, but confine ourselves to the precise case before us.</p>\n<p id=\"Az1\"><em>Verdict set </em>aside.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
