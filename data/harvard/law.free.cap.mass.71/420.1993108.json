At the trial in this court, the defendant offered to show property in- himself. But Metcalf.J. excluded the evidence, the jury returned a verdict for the plaintiffs, and the defendant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b428-7\"><em>S.

Pierce </em>v. <em>Andrews, </em>6 Cush. 4. <em>Roberts </em>v. <em>Wentworth, </em>5 Cush. 193. But if the evidence did not constitute a defence to the action, it was admissible upon the question of damages. <em>Bursley </em>v. <em>Hamilton, </em>15 Pick. 43, and cases there cited by counsel. See also <em>Richardson </em>v. <em>Spencer, </em>6 Ohio, 13.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b428-8\"><em>O. P.

The goods were entrusted to him for sale, as an auctioneer, and he received and sold them in that capacity. He made no claim on them as his property, until he was called upon for the proceeds of the sale. And it neither appears, nor is suggested, that he acted, in the sale, under any ignorance or misapprehension of his own rights. If the goods were his, he purposely misled the plaintiff, and is estopped to make the defence which he now offers. <em>Dewey </em>v. <em>Field, </em>4 Met. 381. <em>Cox </em>v. <em>Buck, </em>3 Strob. 367. <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Wheeler, </em>17 Conn. 345. <em>Strong </em>v. <em>Ellsworth, </em>26 Verm. 373. <em>Hawes </em>v. <em>Watson, </em>2 B. &amp; C. 540. 2 Smith\u2019s Lead.
