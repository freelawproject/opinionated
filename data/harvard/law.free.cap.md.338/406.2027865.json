Supp.), \u00a7\u00a7 12-202 and 12-302 [of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article], the only avenue of appeal from a guilty plea before a circuit court is by application for leave to appeal to the Court of Special Appeals, and an order granting or denying that application is not reviewable by this Court by way of certiorari. We may grant certiorari, however, when the intermediate appellate court makes a decision on an application for leave to appeal based on an alleged denial of victims\u2019 rights. We granted certiorari in this case to address, for the first time, the rights of a victim to speak to the judge or jury prior to the sentencing of a criminal defendant, as provided in Md.Code (1957, 1992 Repl.Vol, 1994 Cum.Supp.), Art. 27, \u00a7 643D.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-11\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b479-12\">Sean Patrick Hall was charged by grand jury indictment in the Circuit Court for Baltimore County in the deaths of Jerome Robert Barrett and James Nicholas C\u00edanos, III, which were caused by Hall\u2019s gross negligence in the operation of a motor vehicle. On January 6,1994, he entered a guilty plea to two counts of manslaughter by automobile and one count of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>driving while intoxicated (DWI). The court scheduled sentencing for March 7, 1994, and ordered a pre-sentence investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-5\">At sentencing, the State was represented by Assistant State\u2019s Attorney John Cox. Pursuant to Md.Code (1957, 1992 Repl.Vol., 1994 Cum.Supp.), Art. 27, \u00a7 643D(a), Mr. Cox requested that the court hear an oral address of Robin C\u00edanos and Evelyn Barrett,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the petitioners, in addition to the written victim impact statements petitioners had previously submitted for the court\u2019s consideration. The court responded to Mr. Cox\u2019s request as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-6\">\u201cMr. Cox, there\u2019s nothing those f\u00edne people [the petitioners] could tell me that hadn\u2019t already been said in whatever letters I\u2019ve received. While I respect their right to be heard, we\u2019re already running, I think, a half hour late. I really don\u2019t think it would be beneficial to take the time to hear from them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-7\">I did read the letters. Very thorough letters. They clearly indicate how deeply these people feel. Nothing they can say will bring the victims back or in any way change what\u2019s happened. I would just rather not take that additional time this morning.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b480-8\">After conferring with the petitioners, Mr. Cox advised the court \u201cI have spoken with both [the petitioners] and they will accede to the Court\u2019s wishes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b480-9\">The court allowed both counsel to argue as to sentencing, allowed Hall his right of allocution, and allowed Debbie Hays, Hall\u2019s girlfriend, to speak on Hall\u2019s behalf.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The court then imposed concurrent five year sentences, with all but 14 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>months suspended, on each of the manslaughter counts,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and one year and a $1000.00 fine on the DWI count.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b481-5\">On April 6, 1994, the petitioners, Robin C\u00edanos and Evelyn Barrett, filed an application for leave to appeal to the Court of Special Appeals. Thereafter, they filed an amended application and a supplement thereto. The Attorney General opposed the application. The Court of Special Appeals, in an unreported opinion dated June 13, 1994, denied the petitioners\u2019 application because it determined that the issues raised by the application were moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b481-7\">The petitioners argue that their appeal is not moot, that the trial court abused its discretion by not allowing them to testify at the sentencing proceeding, and that we are compelled to vacate Hall\u2019s sentence and remand the case to the trial court for resentencing. The State, while acknowledging the importance of victim impact evidence, argues that there was no denial of the petitioners\u2019 rights, and that even if there had been, their appeal is moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-8\">Maryland Code (1957, 1992 Repl.Vol., 1994 Cum.Supp.), Art. 27, \u00a7 643D(a) provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-9\">\u201cIn every case resulting in serious physical injury or death, the victim or a member of the victim\u2019s immediate family, ... may, at the request of the State\u2019s Attorney and in the discretion of the sentencing judge, address the sentencing judge or jury under oath or affirmation before the imposition of sentence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b481-10\">Maryland Code (1957, 1993 Repl.Vol.), Art. 41, \u00a7 4-609(c)(2)(iii) provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>\u201cThe court <em>shall </em>consider the victim impact statement in determining the appropriate sentence ...\u201d (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b482-5\">The above quoted sections are supported by Md.Code (1973, 1989 Repl.Vol., 1994 Cum.Supp.), \u00a7 12-303.1(c) of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article which provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-6\">\u201cAlthough not a party to a criminal proceeding, the victim of the violent crime for which the defendant is charged has a right to file an application for leave to appeal to the Court of Special Appeals <em>from an interlocutory or final order </em>that denies or fails to consider a right secured to that victim by Article 27, ... \u00a7 643D or Article 41, \u00a7 4-609 of the Code\u201d (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b482-7\">This section clearly indicates that leave to appeal can only be sought <em>\u201cfrom an interlocutory or final order </em>that denies or fails to consider a right secured ... by Article 27, ... \u00a7 643D [right to address sentencing judge or jury] or Article 41, \u00a7 4-609 [right to have impact statements considered in sentencing] of the Code.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In the instant case, the trial judge, in effect, requested that the petitioners not address the court, and the petitioners acceded to that request. We will assume, <em>arguendo, </em>that the petitioners were denied their right to address the sentencing court as to the impact of Hall\u2019s crimes upon them. But assuming there had been an order affecting the petitioners\u2019 rights, to serve as the basis for their application, the appeal would still be moot because a decision on the merits of their appeal \u201ccannot have any practical effect on the ... controversy.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 1008 (6th ed. 1990) (citing <em>Leonhart v. McCormick, </em>395 F.Supp. 1073, 1076 (W.D.Pa.1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b482-8\">The only order in this criminal case was the final judgment of conviction and sentence of Hall. Under Md.Code (1973, 1989 Repl.Vol., 1994 Cum.Supp.), \u00a7\u00a7 12-301 and 12-302 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article, only a party may appeal from a final judgment. Maryland Code (1973, 1989 Repl.Vol., 1994 Cum.Supp.), \u00a7 12-303.1 of the Courts and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>Judicial Proceedings Article expressly acknowledges that a victim is not a party in a criminal proceeding. The petitioner-victims, therefore, cannot appeal the only judgment in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-5\">Furthermore, even if the petitioners had applied for leave to appeal prior to the final judgment in this case, such action would not have stayed the criminal proceedings against Hall.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>An appeal by a victim is collateral to and may not interrupt a criminal case, and such an appeal cannot result in a reversal of the judgment and a reopening of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-6\">The petitioners do not argue that the language of \u00a7 12-303.1 is ambiguous; however, they assert that the absence of a provision expressly precluding a victim from challenging a final criminal judgment implies the right to do so. This reasoning ignores the plain language of \u00a7\u00a7 12-301, 12-302, and 12-303.1. Ordinarily, where there is no ambiguity in the language of a statute, there is no need to look elsewhere to ascertain the intent of the General Assembly. <em>E.g., Harris v. State, </em>331 Md. 137, 145-6, 626 A.2d 946, 950 (1993); <em>City of Baltimore v. Hackley, </em>300 Md. 277, 283, 477 A.2d 1174, 1177 (1984); <em>Ryder Truck Lines, Inc. v. Kennedy, </em>296 Md. 528, 535, 463 A.2d 850, 855 (1983). Nevertheless, \u00e1 look at the legislative history of earlier, unsuccessful attempts by certain members of the Legislature to provide victims of violent crime with an avenue of redress demonstrates that the Legislature, in enacting \u00a7 12-303.1, meant what it said and said what it meant. We have previously discussed the legislative history and intent behind earlier bills designed to secure victims\u2019 rights that included provisions invalidating a sentence when required victim testimony was not taken:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b483-7\">\u201cProvisions invalidating the sentence clearly worried the legislators. A memorandum, evidently prepared by staff of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>the House Judiciary Committee, stated, \u2018[t]he major practical problem of both bills ... is the possibility of placing the defendant in jeopardy a second time during the sentencing hearing.\u2019 ... The memorandum concluded that, \u2018House Bill 70 would be acceptable, however, if [the] lines [invalidating the sentence] were deleted. The statute would have no teeth after such a deletion but it would provide the personal input toward which the statute is aimed.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b484-5\"><em>Lodowski v. State, </em>302 Md. 691, 747, 490 A.2d 1228, 1256-57 (1985) (alterations in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b484-6\">For the reasons stated, we affirm the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals, denying petitioners\u2019 application for leave to appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-7\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b484-8\">Notwithstanding our affirmance of the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals, we wish to emphasize the significant duty of trial judges to respond to the will of the people as expressed in legislative acts and constitutional amendments. It is clear that over the past several decades the Legislature has had growing concerns that victims of crime are often neglected by the criminal justice system in the processing of criminal cases. <em>See </em>Ch. 421 of the Acts of 1993, now codified as Md.Code (1973, 1994 Cum.Supp.), \u00a7 12-303.1 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article (providing for appeals by victims of violent crimes); Ch. 385 of the Acts of 1990, now codified as Md.Code (1957, 1992 Repl.Vol., 1994 Cum.Supp.), Art. 27, \u00a7 640(b)(7) (requiring a court refusing to order restitution in a criminal case, when restitution had been requested, to state the court\u2019s reasons on the record for not ordering the restitution); Ch. 486 of the Acts of 1989, now codified as Md.Code (1957, 1992 Repl.Vol., 1994 Cum.Supp.), Art. 27, \u00a7 620 (providing for the presumptive right of a victim or representative to be present at a criminal trial); Ch. 126 of the Acts of 1986, now codified as Md.Code (1957, 1992 Repl.Vol., 1994 Cum.Supp.), Art. 27, \u00a7 643D (providing for the right of a victim, or a representative of victim, to address the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>sentencing judge or jury); Ch. 125 of the Acts of 1986, now codified as Md.Code (1957, 1992 Repl.Vol., 1994 Cum.Supp.), Art. 27, \u00a7 761 (providing guidelines for treatment of and assistance to crime victims and witnesses); Ch. 494 of the Acts of 1982, now codified as amended as Md.Code (1957, 1993 Repl.Vol.), Art. 41, \u00a7 4-609(c) (providing, <em>inter alia, </em>for the use of victim impact statements by the court in determining appropriate sentences). Most recently, the Legislature enacted, and the citizens of Maryland ratified,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Ch. 102 of the Acts of 1994, now codified as Article 47 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights. This Article establishes a crime victims\u2019 bill of rights providing, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-5\">\u201c(a) A victim of crime shall be treated by agents of the State with dignity, respect, and sensitivity during all phases of the criminal justice process.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-6\">(b) In a case originating by indictment or information filed in a circuit court, a victim of crime shall have the right to be informed of the rights established in this Article and, upon request and if practicable, to be notified of, to attend, and to be heard at a criminal justice proceeding, as these rights are implemented and the terms \u2018crime\u2019, \u2018criminal justice proceeding\u2019, and \u2018victim\u2019 are specified by law.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b485-7\">The mandate of the people is clear. In response to that mandate, trial judges <em>must </em>give appropriate consideration to the impact of crime upon the victims. An important step towards accomplishing that task is to accept victim impact testimony wherever possible. Therefore, ordinarily a request by the sentencing judge to the victims that they waive their right to address the court as to the impact of the crimes upon them should not be made. Because the petitioners were arguably denied their rights guaranteed by Md.Code (1957, 1992 Repl.Vol., 1994 Cum.Supp.), Art. 27, \u00a7 643D(a), they will not be burdened with the payment of court costs in the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>\n<em>JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS AFFIRMED.
