Parker initially appeared before the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County for arraignment on December 14, 1992. The case was called for trial on March 30, 1993, before Judge \u25a0 Raymond G. Thieme, Jr., at which time the State advised the court that it was prepared to go to trial but that Parker was not present. Parker\u2019s attorney, who was . also involved in another trial on March 30, advised the trial judge that she did not know where Parker was and that she had been unable to locate him since his release from the detention. which followed his arrest. Judge Thieme, as the circuit administrative judge for the 5th Judicial Circuit, is empowered, pursuant to Md.Rule 1200 c. 2.(a), to perform any of the duties of a county administrative judge for the purpose of compliance with Md.Rule 4-271. Accordingly, he postponed the case and issued a bench warrant for Parker\u2019s arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-7\">Parker was arrested on that warrant on May 12, 1993. By letter dated June 9, 1993, the prosecutor outlined terms of a possible plea agreement and advised Parker\u2019s attorney that he had set trial for July 21, 1993,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> in the event the parties were unable to reach an agreement on a plea. On July 19, 1993, Judge Thieme granted the State\u2019s request for a one-week postponement of the trial and ordered that motions be heard on July 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-8\">On July 21, 1993, Judge Thieme heard arguments on Parker\u2019s motion to dismiss for an alleged violation of Md.Rule 4-271. There was no dispute that the 180-day period specified in Md.Rule 4-271 (the Hicks<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> date) had expired on June 12, 1993. There also was no dispute that following Parker\u2019s arrest in May, the prosecutor had set trial for a date beyond that deadline. In granting Parker\u2019s motion to dismiss, Judge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>Thieme concluded that Md.Rule 4-271 had been violated because the State, after Parker\u2019s arrest in mid-May, had not scheduled a trial date prior to the <em>Hicks </em>date or sought a good cause finding for scheduling a trial date thereafter. Judge Thieme also stated that he had granted a postponement on March 30 because Parker was not present for trial- but declined to determine whether there had been an inordinate delay between Parker\u2019s arrest on May 12 and the new trial date.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">The Court of Special Appeals, in an unreported opinion, affirmed the judgment of dismissal. We granted certiorari upon the State\u2019s petition to determine whether dismissal was proper under these circumstances. For the reasons set forth below, we shall hold that dismissal was inappropriate in this case because Md.Rule 4-271 was satisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b278-7\">The State contends that the appropriate rationale to be applied in this case is the two-step analysis which we employed in <em>Rosenbach v. State, </em>314 Md. 473, 480, 551 A.2d 460, 463 (1989), and re-affirmed in <em>State v. Cook, </em>322 Md. 93, 97-98, 585 A.2d 833, 835 (1991), which requires a finding of both good cause for postponement and the lack of inordinate delay in scheduling the ultimate trial date to satisfy Md.Rule 4-271. The State concludes that, if the <em>Rosenbach </em>analysis is employed, dismissal is not warranted in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-8\">Parker contends that the <em>Rosenbach </em>analysis does not apply in this case and that the prosecutor had an obligation to go to the administrative judge when it became clear that the case could not be tried within the 180-day limit. In Parker\u2019s words, \u201c[i]f the combination of when the failure to appear occurred and the length of time it takes to correct it is such that the prosecutor cannot try the case within the 180 day limit, then the prosecutor must go to the Administrative judge, explain the circumstances, and ask permission to exceed the 180 day limit.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b278-9\">The Court of Special Appeals agreed with Parker, holding:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>\u201cIn this case, the prosecutor took it upon himself to schedule the trial beyond the 180-day deadline without first seeking the approval-of the administrative judge. We are unable to conclude that the administrative judge abused his discretion in finding that the scheduling of the case was made without a good cause finding by the administrative judge. It follows that the court did not err in dismissing the indictment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">Without even mentioning the <em>Rosenbach </em>decision, the intermediate appellate court affirmed the dismissal of the case, based on the <em>scheduling </em>of the case by the prosecutor beyond the <em>Hicks </em>date without requesting a finding of good cause from the administrative judge. Accordingly, we shall reverse the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals and remand this case for trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b279-7\">In <em>State v. Hicks, 285 </em>Md. 310, 403 A.2d 368 (1979), we stated that the provisions of Maryland Code (1957, 1976 Repl.Vol.), Art. 27, \u00a7 591<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and Md.Rule 746, the forerunner to Rule 4-271, were mandatory:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-8\">\u201cThe provisions of Rule 746 are of mandatory application, binding upon the prosecution and defense alike; they are not mere guides or bench marks to be observed, if convenient. Accordingly, Judge Pollitt was correct in holding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>that Rule 746 is mandatory and that dismissal of the criminal charges is the appropriate sanction where the State fails to bring the case to trial within the 120-day period prescribed by the rule and where \u2018extraordinary cause\u2019 justifying a trial postponement has not been established.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b280-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 318, 403 A.2d at 360. At its 1980 session, the Legislature retained the scope and mandatory nature of \u00a7 591, but changed the \u201cextraordinary cause\u201d requirement to one of \u201cgood cause.\u201d Ch. 378 of the Acts of 1980.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We later set forth the standard for reviewing a motion to dismiss for failure to try a defendant within 180 days:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-5\">\u201cAs the <em>Hicks </em>and <em>Goins </em>[293 Md. 97, 442 A.2d 550 (1982) ] cases make clear, a trial judge entertaining such a motion must ordinarily grant it if the case was not tried within 180 days and if the trial was not postponed beyond that deadline in accordance with the statute and rule. But in making this determination, when reviewing a postponement beyond the 180-day deadline ordered by the administrative judge, deference must be accorded the judgment of the administrative judge and those assignment personnel acting under his supervision. We hold, therefore, as follows: with regard to both components of the \u2018good cause\u2019 requirement in \u00a7 591 and Rule 746, the trial judge (as well as an appellate court) shall not find an absence of good cause unless the defendant meets the burden of demonstrating either a clear abuse of discretion or a lack of good cause as a matter of law.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b280-6\"><em>State v. Frazier, </em>298 Md. 422, 454, 470 A.2d 1269, 1286 (1984).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-7\">Before addressing whether there was good cause in this case, we must first determine when the critical postponement occurred:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>\u201c \u2018The critical order by the administrative judge, for purposes of the dismissal sanction, is the order having the effect of extending the trial date beyond 180 days.\u2019 <em>Frazier, </em>298 Md. at 428, 470 A.2d at 1272. Further, our holding in <em>Goins v. State, </em>293 Md. 97, 442 A.2d 550 (1982), illustrates that the postponing judge need not make a specific finding that the postponement will of necessity carry the case beyond the 180 days.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b281-5\"><em>Rosenbach v. State, </em>314 Md. at 478, 551 A.2d at 462. Once that date has been determined, we can address the remaining two-step analysis set out in <em>Rosenbach:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-6\">\u201cNor is it essential, under the statute and rule, that the postponing judge, at the time of postponement or thereafter, personally reset or cause the case to be reset for a particular date.... But the only prerequisite is that the administrative judge or that judge\u2019s designee find good cause. Once that determination is made, the postponement is valid for purposes of the rule, subject only to the deferential review accorded the judge\u2019s good cause finding....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-7\">Once that occurs, the question is no longer whether there was a postponement for good cause. The issue then becomes the length of the delay. A case postponed for good cause may yet run afoul of the statute and rule if, after a valid postponement, there is inordinate delay in bringing the case to trial. The purpose of the rule is to promote the expeditious disposition of criminal cases, and this purpose is not served if, after a good cause postponement, nothing further is done to achieve that goal. Thus, the dismissal sanction may once again be invoked if, after a good cause postponement, trial is not begun with reasonable promptness.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b281-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 479, 551 A.2d at 462-63 (citations omitted). The administrative judge need not be aware that his or her postponement will carry the case beyond the 180-day limit and need not set the trial for a specific future date. <em>Id. </em>at 480, 551 A.2d at 463. \u201cIt is enough that the postponement be made by the administrative judge or designee, that it be for good cause, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>and that there be no inordinate delay between the postponement and the eventual trial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">Once the critical postponement date is ascertained, therefore, we must apply a two-step analysis. First, we must ask whether there was good cause for the postponement which occurred on the critical date, and then we must determine if there was inordinate delay between the time of the good cause postponement and the trial date set by the assignment authority, in this case the Office of the State\u2019s Attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b282-7\">The critical postponement date in this case was March 30, the date on which the defendant failed to appear for trial. The indefinite postponement granted on that date carried the defendant\u2019s second trial date beyond the 180-day limit. <em>See Frazier, </em>298 Md. at 428, 470 A.2d at 1272. Judge Thieme, as the circuit administrative judge, was the appropriate person to make the required good cause finding. Although Judge Thieme made no express finding of good cause for the March 30 postponement, it is patently obvious that unavailability of the defendant for trial constitutes good cause for a postponement. <em>See, e.g., Frazier, </em>298 Md. at 462-63, 470 A.2d at 1290 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b282-8\">The error made by both the Court of Special Appeals and the circuit administrative judge was reading Rule 4-271 as requiring a specific good cause finding prior to <em>scheduling </em>of the case beyond the 180-day limit. The scheduling of the case by the Office of the State\u2019s Attorney was not the action that required good cause \u2014 the March 30 postponement was. <em>Rosenbach </em>sets forth three important propositions: (1) the postponement which, in fact, carries the case beyond the 180-day limit, is the critical event, not the scheduling of the trial; (2) the judge granting that postponement need not be aware that it will cause the trial to occur beyond the 180-day limit and need not be involved in the rescheduling of the case; and (3) if the critical postponement was supported by good cause, the case will not be dismissed for failure to try the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>before the <em>Hicks </em>date unless there has been an inordinate delay in scheduling the case for trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">Because good cause existed for the March 30 postponement by the circuit administrative judge in the instant case, the only remaining question in applying the principles set forth above is that of inordinate delay. Judge Thieme refused to make a finding on this issue at the hearing on Parker\u2019s motion to dismiss, and the intermediate appellate court also did not address the issue. The indefinite postponement was granted on March 30, but Parker was not arrested until mid-May. Thereafter, counsel were engaged in efforts to resolve the case without a trial. Little more than two months passed between Parker\u2019s second arrest and the new trial date. As a matter of law, we hold that the delay in this case between the time the defendant was arrested after his failure to appear for the initial trial date and the time of his ultimate trial date was not inordinate. We need not remand the case for a hearing on this issue, as we have upheld longer delays in previous cases. <em>See Rosenbach, supra </em>(characterizing 78-day delay as insufficient to meet Rosenbach\u2019s burden of showing inordinate delay); <em>State v. Bonev, </em>299 Md. 79, 472 A.2d 476 (1984) (delay in excess of three months not a clear abuse of discretion); <em>State v. Frazier, supra </em>(no inordinate delay where delays ranged from slightly under three months to almost four months).</p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">As there was good cause for the initial postponement and no inordinate delay occurred in rescheduling the case for trial after Parker\u2019s second arrest, there was no violation of Md. Rule 4-271.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-7\">\n<em>JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS REVERSED.
