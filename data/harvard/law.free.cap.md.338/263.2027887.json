These questions are closely interrelated. Treated together, they require that another related issue be addressed: the propriety of the court permitting the privilege to be invoked premised on an invalid plea agreement. This issue necessitates an assessment of the adequacy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>of the inquiry and procedure employed by the court to determine that the privilege was properly invoked. Having inquired of counsel for the witness, who was not present, as to the advice he gave the witness, the trial court refused to allow the witness to be called for any purpose. Roger Lawrence Bhagwat, the appellant, appealed to the Court of Special Appeals. We granted certiorari, on our own motion, prior to that court considering the matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">The facts of this case are rather simple. On November 13, 1992, pursuant to a search and seizure warrant, members of the Prince George\u2019s County police department and federal officers conducted a search of 804 Maury Avenue, # 106, Oxon Hill, Maryland, premises undisputedly owned by the appellant\u2019s parents, Norma and Lai Ranrattan Bhagwat. Glassine baggies, a triple beam scale, a handgun, a shotgun, two separately packaged quantities of crack cocaine, and $400.00 in currency were seized from the premises. Crack cocaine (4.3 grams), $266.00 in cash, and a cellular phone were seized from the person of the appellant, when he approached the premises.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b339-6\">The appellant was charged, together with his brother, Christopher Bhagwat (hereinafter \u201cChristopher\u201d), in a multicount indictment alleging possession of cocaine with intent to distribute; possession of cocaine; conspiracy to distribute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>cocaine;<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and use of a firearm in drug trafficking.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Christopher accepted the State\u2019s plea offer,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> but the appellant chose to go to trial. The first time the trial court discussed whether Christopher could be called as a witness was just prior to trial, when the court was apprised that Christopher had accepted the plea offer and that the appellant had subpoenaed Christopher as a witness. In response to the court\u2019s inquiry whether he had advised, Christopher of his Fifth Amendment rights, Christopher\u2019s attorney replied:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-5\">Yes. The plea agreement is contingent on him not exonerating his brother, but also not implicating his brother. I have so advised him not to testify.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-6\">If, in fact, he would be called he would be taking his Fifth Amendment, exercising his Fifth Amendment rights.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AU5\">Because the matter was not then ripe for decision,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the court did not rule on the. issue at that time, deciding, instead, to allow the matter to \u201cdevelop as it develops.\u201d The record reflects, however, that the court believed that Christopher could invoke his privilege against self-incrimination without <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>personally taking the witness stand; it was sufficient that his attorney advised the court of his decision not to testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">The issue surfaced again during the trial. The appellant having subpoenaed Christopher, a hearing was held outside the presence of the jury to determine whether Christopher would testify. Christopher was not present<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> at the hearing at which the following colloquy occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-6\">THE COURT: ... The posture we are in at the moment is as I understand it Mr. Petros has subpoenaed brother Chris.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-7\">MR. CONWAY: Yes, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-8\">THE COURT: It is my understanding from the State that whatever their plea offer was to brother Chris included a condition that he not testify for either side, defense or State, in brother Roger\u2019s case. In spite of that agreement Mr. Petros has subpoenaed him and intends to call him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-9\">I want to point out to you, however, there has been evidence in this case \u2014 what is the number, the black jacket?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-10\">MR. PETROS: Defense 2.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-11\">THE COURT: Defendant\u2019s Number 2, the dark jacket there belongs to Chris, and there has also, been evidence that cocaine was seized from that jacket.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-12\">MR. CONWAY: I understand, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-13\">MR. PETROS: There is also State\u2019s Exhibit 18 which was Chris\u2019 and came in over objection. The pager. Which the State ties in\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-14\">MR. CONWAY: I was not aware of those developments, but I am aware, and I have been advised by my client that he would be invoking his Fifth Amendment privilege so as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>to not to vitiate the agreement that he has with the government.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">Rejecting the appellant\u2019s argument, the court refused to allow the appellant to call Christopher noting that his counsel \u201chas indicated he has advised him to plead the Fifth,\u201d and that \u201c[t]he evidence so far by putting him on the stand, by calling him to the stand incriminates him.\u201d The court was not impressed with the appellant\u2019s argument that the limited inquiry he intended to make with respect to the ownership of a coat found in the raid and the Jeep Cherokee could not incriminate Christopher.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Indeed, the court asserted that, \u201cIf you ask him his name he has a right to plead the Fifth.\u201d Moreover, to the appellant\u2019s lament that the refusal to allow him to call Christopher \u201cis highly prejudicial,\u201d the court responded, \u201c[i]t is highly prejudicial to Christopher, that is who it is highly prejudicial to.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b342-6\">The appellant was convicted of possession with the intent to distribute cocaine and possession of cocaine. He received a mandatory sentence of ten years imprisonment, without the possibility of parole.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b342-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-8\">The privilege against self-incrimination is guaranteed under both Maryland and federal law.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> It only protects <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>against self-incrimination compelled by the government or its agents. <em>See Choi v. State, </em>316 Md. 529, 536, 560 A.2d 1108, 1111 (1989); <em>Allen v. State, </em>183 Md. 603, 607, 39 A.2d 820, 821-22 (1944); <em>Marshall v. State, </em>182 Md. 379, 383, 35 A.2d 115, 117 (1943); <em>Jacobs v. State, </em>45 Md.App. 634, 653-54, 415 A.2d 590, 601, <em>cert. denied, </em>288 Md. 737 (1980). <em>See </em>also McLain, <em>Maryland Evidence, </em>\u00a7 514.1, at 603 (1987 &amp; Supp. 1994). The privilege is waivable, affording no protection for statements voluntarily given. <em>See </em>McLain, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 514.1, at 603. <em>See also, Choi v. State, </em>316 Md. at 542-43, 560 A.2d at 1114-15; <em>Adams v. State, </em>200 Md. 133, 144, 88 A.2d 556, 561 (1952). Moreover, it is well-settled that the privilege is personal to the witness and, thus, must be exercised by the witness. <em>Royal v. State, </em>236 Md. 443, 447, 204 A.2d 500, 502 (1964). And \u201cbecause the privilege is not a prohibition of inquiry, but is an option of refusal,\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>id.,</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>[t]he witness should first be called to the stand and sworn. <em>Midgett v. State, </em>223 Md. 282, 289, 164 A.2d 526, 529 (1960), <em>cert. denied, </em>365 U.S. 853, 81 S.Ct. 819, 5 L.Ed.2d 817 (1961). Interrogation of the witness should then proceed to the point where he [or she] asserts his [or her] privilege against self-incrimination as a ground for not answering a question. <em>Shifflett v. State, </em>245 Md. 169, 173-74, 225 A.2d 440, 443 (1967). If it is a jury case, the jury should then be dismissed and the trial judge should attempt to \u2018determine whether the claim of privilege is in good faith or lacks any reasonable basis.\u2019 <em>Midgett v. State, supra, </em>223 Md. at 289[, 164 A.2d at 530]. If further interrogation is pursued, then the witness should either answer the questions asked or assert his [or her] privilege, making this decision on a question by question basis. <em>Royal v. State, </em>236 Md. 443, 447, 204 A.2d 500, 502 (1964).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b344-5\"><em>Richardson v. State, </em>285 Md. 261, 265, 401 A.2d 1021, 1024 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b344-6\">The test of the witness\u2019s entitlement to invoke the privilege against self-incrimination \u2014 (1) whether there is a reasonable basis for the invocation of the privilege; and (2) whether the privilege is invoked in good faith, <em>see Adkins v. State, supra, </em>316 Md. at 6-7, 557 A.2d at 205-06; <em>Richardson v. State, supra, </em>285 Md. at 265, 401 A.2d at 1024; <em>Midgett v. State, </em>223 Md. at 288-92, 164 A.2d at 529-31; McLain, <em>Maryland Evidence, supra, </em>\u00a7 514.1, at 605 \u2014 was well stated in <em>Choi v. State, </em>316 Md. 529, 560 A.2d 1108 (1989). It is whether \u201cthe witness has reasonable cause to apprehend danger from a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>direct answer,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 536, 560 A.2d at 1111, and whether it is \u201cevident from the implications of the question, in the setting in which it is asked, that a responsive answer to the question or an explanation of why it cannot be answered might be dangerous because injurious disclosure could result.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 537, 560 A.2d at 1111.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">Although the privilege is a personal one, under some circumstances, the witness\u2019s counsel may focus the witness\u2019s attention to the privilege, or acting as the witness\u2019s agent, plead it on his or her behalf. <em>See Farmer v. State, </em>5 Md.App. 546, 551, 248 A.2d 809, 812 (1968), <em>cert. denied, </em>253 Md. 733 (1969); <em>McCormick on Evidence, </em>\u00a7 120, at 289 (E. Cleary 3d ed. 1984). <em>See also Rowe v. State, </em>62 Md.App. 486, 499, 490 A.2d 278, 284, <em>cert. denied, </em>303 Md. 684, 496 A.2d 683 (1985); <em>Pope v. State, </em>7 Md.App. 533, 538, 256 A.2d 529, 532 (1969); <em>Poling v. State, </em>6 Md.App. 45, 47, 250 A.2d 126, 127, <em>cert. denied, </em>255 Md. 743 (1969). Thus, an attorney representing a witness by objecting to a question on the grounds that it may incriminate the witness, initiates and essentially invokes the witness\u2019s privilege, if the witness adopts the objection by refusing to answer the question. <em>Farmer, </em>5 Md.App. at 551, 248 A.2d at 812.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-6\">Where there is a clear indication, reflected on the record, that the witness intends to invoke the privilege against self-incrimination if called to the witness stand, the <em>Richardson </em>procedure need not be strictly applied. <em>See Adkins, supra, </em>316 Md. at 8 n. 7, 557 A.2d at 206 n. 7. In that case, if it is a jury trial, \u201c[t]he mechanical procedure of first calling the witness before the jury\u201d should be omitted. <em>Id. </em>In other words, the witness should be called and sworn, but without the jury being present,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and questioned before or by the court. In this way, the court is enabled to perform its function of determining whether the privilege has been invoked in good <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>faith or has a reasonable basis. <em>Midgett v. State, supra, </em>223 Md. at 289, 164 A.2d at 530.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">As the State points out, not all plea agreements which cause a witness to invoke the right against self-incrimination are constitutionally flawed. Absent an indication that the State was thereby seeking to discourage or prevent the witness from testifying, a plea agreement contemplating that the guilty plea be entered after the co-defendant\u2019s trial has been upheld in the face of a compulsory process challenge, even though its effect may be to cause that defendant to refuse to testify on Fifth Amendment grounds when called by the co-defendant. <em>See United States v. Munoz, </em>957 F.2d 171, 173 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>___ U.S. ___, 113 S.Ct. 332, 121 L.Ed.2d 250 (1992); <em>State v. Rivera, </em>124 Ariz. 123, 602 P.2d 504, 506 (Ct.App.1979). It has also been held that merely informing a defendant, called by his co-defendant and to whom the State had tendered an offer of a plea agreement, that the offer \u201cmight be rescinded if [his testimony] connected [him] more to the crime than the police believed\u201d did not establish that that defendant had been induced not to testify, since he \u201ccertainly was entitled to exercise his Fifth Amendment right to avoid self-incrimination and not to testify for the appellant.\u201d <em>Daniel v. State, </em>623 So.2d 438, 442-43 (Ala.Crim.App.1993). Where, by the terms of the plea agreement, a co-defendant is precluded from testifying for the defendant, courts recognize that as a denial of the defendant\u2019s right to compulsory process. <em>See Jones v. United States, </em>386 A.2d 308, 316 n. 7 (D.C.App.1978), ce<em>rt. denied, </em>444 U.S. 925, 100 S.Ct. 263, 62 L.Ed.2d 181 (1979) (\u201cThere is no question that the government\u2019s use of a plea bargain in order to induce or encourage a witness\u2019 silence cannot be tolerated.\u201d); <em>United States v. Bell, </em>506 F.2d 207, 222 (D.C.Cir.1974) (\u201cInarguably, governmental impairment of the accused\u2019s ability to call witnesses in his [or her] behalf cannot be tolerated.\u201d); <em>People v. Fryer, </em>247 Ill.App.3d 1051, 187 Ill.Dec. 786, 795, 618 N.E.2d 377, 386 (1993) (\u201cIt is one thing to condition a plea agreement on a witness\u2019 abstaining from testifying falsely; it may be quite another thing to condition a plea agreement on the witness\u2019 abstaining from testifying at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>all.\u201d);<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> or due process, <em>United States v. Henricksen, </em>564 F.2d 197, 198 (5th Cir.1977) (per curiam); <em>State v. Fort, </em>101 N.J. 123, 501 A.2d 140, 144 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">In <em>Fort, supra </em>\u2014 not unlike the case <em>sub judice </em>\u2014 the State\u2019s plea agreement with two of the defendant\u2019s co-defendants provided that the co-defendants would not testify on behalf of the two defendants on trial. The defendants contended that such a \u201cno testimony agreement\u201d deprived them of the testimony of the co-defendants and thereby violated their federal and state compulsory process rights. The Supreme Court of New Jersey opined that a \u201cno testimony agreement\u201d has the clear capacity to prejudice a defendant. 501 A.2d at 144. Moreover, the court noted that once the State extracts, as a condition of his or her plea agreement, a promise from a witness not to testify, then it is nearly impossible to determine whether the witness\u2019s refusal to testify is based on the privilege against self-incrimination or the desire to satisfy the plea agreement. <em>Id. </em>The court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b347-6\">[T]he \u2018no testimony\u2019 agreement violated defendants\u2019 constitutional rights to due process and to present witnesses in their favor. Underlying this conclusion is our belief that the trial, although inevitably an adversarial proceeding, is above all else a search for truth. That quest is better served when the State does not suppress the truth by sealing the lips of witnesses.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b347-7\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b347-8\">Although we have not previously had the occasion to consider this issue, our review of the authorities persuades us that a plea agreement with a co-defendant conditioned upon that co-defendant\u2019s not testifying for the defense, may deny the defendant on trial both the Sixth Amendment right to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>compulsory process and due process. While not so proscriptive as a state rule disqualifying an alleged accomplice from testifying on behalf of his partner in crime, <em>see Washington v. Texas, </em>388 U.S. 14, 87 S.Ct. 1920, 18 L.Ed.2d 1019 (1967), or as blatantly coercive as a \u201clengthy and intimidating warning\u201d by a trial judge, threatening the potential witness with a grand jury investigation for perjury, <em>see Webb v. Texas, </em>409 U.S. 95, 97, 93 S.Ct. 351, 353, 34 L.Ed.2d 330, 333 (1972) (per curiam), such a plea agreement does implicate the defendant\u2019s fundamental right to present witnesses. Moreover, as the <em>Fort </em>court pointed out, a trial is more than an adversarial proceeding, it is, more importantly, a search for the truth. <em>Fort, </em>501 A.2d at 144. If the State is permitted singlehandedly to silence witnesses, that search is seriously impeded and the credibility of the entire judicial system is seriously undermined.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-6\">The State concedes that <em>Richardson </em>outlines the procedure to be followed when a witness invokes the privilege against self-incrimination, and it does not disagree with the appellant\u2019s contention that the trial court did not follow that procedure in this case. Characterizing the appellant\u2019s complaint as \u201ctechnical,\u201d it submits that the refusal of the trial court to allow Christopher to be called to invoke the privilege personally, after questioning, and instead, allowing Christopher\u2019s attorney to invoke it for him, does not require reversal. The State relies on <em>Midgett, supra. </em>In that case, the defendant called his co-defendant as his witness. When the trial court advised the co-defendant, who was not sworn, that he had the right not to incriminate himself and that if he waived that right and testified, he might be asked questions and then give answers which might incriminate him in his own subsequent proceedings, he elected not to testify. The trial court excused the co-defendant. The defendant challenged not only the propriety of the co-defendant\u2019s exercise of the privilege, but also the procedure by which he was allowed to do so. In rejecting both challenges, this Court noted, \u201c[although it would have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>been better practice that the witness should first have been put under oath, we cannot find any prejudice to the defendant from the manner in which [the invocation of his privilege] was handled.\u201d 223 Md. at 292, 164 A.2d at 531. We pointed out that the co-defendant\u2019s statement that \u201c \u2018[w]ell, in that case, then, I won\u2019t be able to testify because it would cause irreparable damage to my case,\u2019 \u201d <em>id. </em>at 291, 164 A.2d at 531, was a sufficient statement of a claim of privilege and that \u201c[t]he oath of the witness would have added nothing to the information ... which was before the court....\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 292, 164 A.2d at 531.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">The State argues, therefore, that where the purpose underlying the rule that the privilege against self-incrimination must be exercised personally has been satisfied, the violation is technical and the defendant is not prejudiced; hence, reversal is not required.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> It stresses that those purposes were stated in <em>Midgett </em>as being to allow the witness to determine whether to invoke the privilege, \u201cnot that the rule is for the exclusion of unreliable evidence,\u201d and to permit the court to determine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>whether the claim is made in good faith and has a reasonable basis. 223 Md. at 289, 164 A.2d at 530.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">With regard to the appellant\u2019s argument concerning the validity of the plea agreement, the State argues that it is not preserved for appellate review. To support that argument, it points to the fact that at no time did the appellant argue that the plea agreement violated his Sixth Amendment right to compulsory process. The appellant argued only that the witness had no right to invoke the privilege against self-incrimination and, in any event, should have personally invoked the privilege, after questioning. Because \u201c[a]n argument not made at trial in support of the admission of evidence cannot be asserted for the first time on appeal,\u201d the State concludes, citing <em>White v. State, </em>324 Md. 626, 640, 598 A.2d 187, 194 (1991), that the appellant has waived the compulsory process issue as an appellate issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-7\">The precise terms of the plea agreement between Christopher and the State did not appear in the record. The record references to that agreement, by the trial court and Christopher\u2019s counsel, however, make clear that one of its provisions was that Christopher not be a defense witness. When the matter first came up, Christopher\u2019s attorney characterized the agreement as being \u201ccontingent on him not exonerating his brother, but also not implicating his brother.\u201d At trial, the trial court characterized it as including \u201ca condition that he not testify for either side, defense or State, in brother Roger\u2019s case.\u201d Later, after Christopher had been subpoenaed as a defense witness and the court had apprised him of evidentiary developments of significance to his client, Christopher\u2019s attorney\u2019s comments once again provided insight into the terms of the plea agreement, when he informed the court, \u201cI have been advised by my client that he would be invoking his Fifth Amendment privilege <em>so as to not to vitiate the agreement that he has with the government.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b351-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>There is, to be sure, as the State argues, evidence in the record sufficient to permit the trial court to conclude that Christopher invoked the privilege against self-incrimination in good faith and on a reasonable basis. Indeed, upon examining the inquiry the appellant proffered he wanted to make concerning admissible evidence connecting Christopher to the cocaine seized on the premises in light of the test of self-incrimination, <em>see Choi, </em>316 Md. at 536-37, 560 A.2d at 1111, the court properly could find that Christopher reasonably apprehended danger from either a direct answer or an explanation as to why a direct answer could not be given. On the other hand, the existence of a pending plea agreement between Christopher and the State, contingent upon Christopher not testifying for the appellant, presents another consideration which obscures the basis for Christopher\u2019s decision. That fact, viewed in light of the statement by Christopher\u2019s counsel that the privilege was being invoked \u201cso as to not to vitiate the agreement that he has with the government,\u201d provides evidence that it was the proscription of the plea agreement, rather than the privilege, that motivated Christopher\u2019s decision not to testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">If there were no plea agreement and, thus, the only issues before the court were whether the court correctly determined that Christopher appropriately invoked the privilege against self-incrimination and employed the proper procedure for making that determination, the State\u2019s argument that a mere technical violation had occurred would be directly presented for our review.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Where, however, as here, there is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>more than one conceivable basis for the witness\u2019s refusal to testify, one of which is improper, the court has more to do than simply determine whether the witness has a good faith basis for invoking his or her privilege against self-incrimination; it must determine which of the possible reasons actually prompted the response. In this case, Christopher could have acted for the purpose of avoiding making incriminating statements, as invocation of the privilege against self-incrimination contemplates, or he could have been acting consistent with his concern that he remain eligible to receive the benefits of a favorable plea agreement. As to the latter, his continued eligibility depended upon his refraining from testifying for his brother, the appellant. To be sure, as we have seen, invoking one\u2019s Fifth Amendment privilege to retain eligibility for a favorable plea agreement ordinarily is not improper, but a plea agreement conditioned upon a witness refraining from testifying for the defendant is improper. It follows, therefore, that where the plea agreement is improper, invoking one\u2019s Fifth Amendment privilege to avoid violating the plea agreement may also be improper or, at least, makes the real reason for refusing to testify unclear. Saying that one is invoking one\u2019s Fifth Amendment privilege to avoid violating a plea agreement with the State is, at the very least, ambiguous. In such a circumstance, it is incumbent on the trial court to inquire as to which of the reasons given is the real reason for the refusal. Such an inquiry requires the presence of the witness and not just his or her counsel.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Of course, in this case, no inquiry of any kind was made of the witness. Consequently, other than counsel\u2019s comment that it was to avoid violating the plea agreement, even had the witness invoked the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>privilege personally, it has never been determined why he did so \u2014 whether it was because he wanted to avoid incriminating himself or because he wanted to perform the promise.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">It is true, as the State asserts, that the appellant never argued to the trial court that the plea agreement, by precluding the witness from testifying for the appellant, violated his Sixth Amendment right to compulsory process or, for that matter, violated public policy. The main thrust of his argument, instead, was that the witness had to exercise his Fifth Amendment privilege personally and, therefore, had to take the witness stand. He also disputed the court\u2019s determination that his proffered inquiry would implicate the witness\u2019s privilege against self-incrimination. Moreover, he insisted that the court\u2019s ruling was \u201chighly prejudicial\u201d to his case. We do not believe that preservation of an objection premised on the violation of a specific constitutional provision requires that constitutional provision to be specifically mentioned as the basis for the objection. It is enough that the record reflects that the propriety of the action that is the object of the objection, here the decision to permit Christopher to invoke his Fifth Amendment privilege and the procedure employed, has been challenged as unlawful. The State does not argue that the appellant did not challenge the efficacy of the plea agreement or the correctness of the court\u2019s privilege ruling. Indeed, the entire thrust of the appellant\u2019s argument was that it was the plea agreement, which prompted Christopher\u2019s taking of the Fifth which, in turn, adversely affected his ability to obtain testimony favorable to his cause. He did, and said, enough, we hold, to preserve the issue for review.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b354-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>IY.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">Consistent with his understanding of the plea agreement, appellant\u2019s counsel proffered that he was calling Christopher with regard to the ownership of the Jeep Cherokee and the jacket found in the bedroom of the searched premises. He expected Christopher to testify that both belonged to him and not to the appellant. At trial, the appellant and his father so testified.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b354-6\">Asserting that \u201cnumerous other witnesses testified\u201d as to Christopher\u2019s ownership of the Jeep and the jacket, the State contends that the appellant suffered no prejudice from the ruling of the trial court accepting Christopher\u2019s exercise of the privilege against self-incrimination. It, in other words, argues that the trial court\u2019s error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt and does not require reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-7\"><em>The </em>test of harmless error is whether \u201ca reviewing court, upon its own independent review of the record, is able to declare a belief, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the error in no way influenced the verdict.... \u201d <em>Dorsey v. State, </em>276 Md. 638, 659, 350 A.2d 665, 678 (1976). Thus, reversal is required unless the trial error did not influence the verdict. The reviewing court must exclude that possibility \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d Although the appellant and his father testified as to the ownership of the Jeep and the coat, that is not to suggest that Christopher\u2019s testimony confirming or corroborating that testimony would have added nothing to the case. We cannot say, therefore, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the trial court\u2019s error was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>The State also argues that the appellant\u2019s conviction was based only on the cocaine found <em>on his person. </em>It relies on the fact that the jury found the appellant not guilty of both conspiracy to distribute cocaine and use of a firearm during a drug trafficking offense, thus, indicating that the jury was not convinced that the cocaine seized from the back bedroom closet was under the dominion and control of the appellant. Asserting that the appellant\u2019s counsel and the trial court shared this view,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> the State maintains, therefore, that even if Christopher had testified that the drugs and paraphernalia found in the back bedroom were his, that testimony would not have affected the jury\u2019s verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">Notwithstanding the conclusion drawn by the appellant\u2019s counsel and the trial court, it is not at all clear upon what basis the jury determined the appellant\u2019s guilt of possession and possession with intent to distribute cocaine. Counts one and two of the indictment drew no distinction between cocaine found on the appellant\u2019s person and that recovered from the back bedroom closet. And, of course, the jury did not return a special verdict in that regard. Moreover, in its case in chief and, indeed, in cross-examining the appellant and his witnesses, the State spent a significant amount of time attempting to establish a connection between appellant and his parents\u2019 home during the requisite period and, by that connection, his dominion and control over the cocaine and related paraphernalia found there. Thus, the State offered an envelope, postmarked October 22, 1992, and addressed to the appellant at that address, and testimony that the police observed the appellant at the premises shortly before the search and seizure warrant was executed. The expert testimony the State <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>offered was designed to explain why the appellant would maintain a connection with his parents\u2019 home, even after he no longer lived there. To that end, the expert testified as to what a stash house is and how it is used.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> And, while the expert testified that the 4.3 grams of cocaine allegedly recovered from the appellant\u2019s person was, itself, consistent with an intent to distribute, he gave the same opinion with respect to the other quantities of cocaine seized from the bedroom closet.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">The jury was instructed with respect to the constructive possession of cocaine and, in that regard, was told to consider all of the circumstances. Such an instruction has no value but for the State\u2019s contention that the appellant had dominion and control over the cocaine found in the back bedroom closet. The State\u2019s closing argument referred not only to the cocaine allegedly recovered from the appellant\u2019s person but also to the cocaine recovered from the back bedroom, which it characterized as packaged for distribution. The State also argued that the appellant\u2019s parents\u2019 home was a stash house, out of which the appellant operated. In arguing for a guilty verdict on the use of a firearm in a drug trafficking offense count, the prosecutor relied not simply on the value of the cocaine allegedly found on the appellant\u2019s person, but on the total value of all of the cocaine the police recovered in the raid, as well as the $400.00 in cash taken from a safe in the closet. Although the prosecutor maintained that the appellant\u2019s guilt could be established on the basis of the 4.3 grams alone, he stressed, in addition, the appellant\u2019s dominion and control over the cocaine at his parents\u2019 home, as to which he asserted that a sufficient nexus was shown.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-6\">That the jury found the appellant not guilty of the firearm offense and the conspiracy count does not lead inexorably to the conclusion that the jury\u2019s verdict was based only on the 4.3 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>grams of cocaine. The trial court instructed the jury on the use of a handgun in a drug trafficking offense in the words of the statute, <em>ie., </em>\u201cduring and in relation to any drug trafficking crime, a person who uses, wears, carries, or transports a firearm is guilty of a separate felony.\u201d It then told the jury that the firearm \u201chas to be intended to be used in the general drug trafficking culture.\u201d By way of clarification, the court supplemented its instructions telling the jury that \u201cmere possession of a firearm in one\u2019s own home is legal,\u201d but that \u201c[wjhere a firearm is found proximate to drugs, money, and related accoutrements, the question is whether the placement of the weapon was designed to . facilitate the narcotics enterprise, by, say protecting against untoward contingencies or safeguarding the cache of drugs.\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> From this definition, it is clear that the jury could have concluded that more than possession of the firearm proximate to the drugs was required.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">Nor is it clear why the jury found the appellant not guilty of a conspiracy. It could be that the jury compromised the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-6\">In any case, given the test of harmless error, it is not at all clear, beyond a reasonable doubt, that Christopher Bhagwat\u2019s testimony may not have influenced the jury\u2019s verdict. Accordingly, a new trial is required.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-7\">\n<em>JUDGMENTS REVERSED. CASE REMANDED TO THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR PRINCE GEORGE\u2019S COUNTY FOR A NEW TRIAL.

The evidence was conflicting, however, as to whether he was living there at the time of the raid. The appellant was connected to the premises by an envelope, postmarked October 22, 1992, addressed to him at that address and his passport, recovered from his parents bedroom. The lead detective also testified that the appellant gave the Maury Avenue address as his residence when he was arrested.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-8\">Complaints about shootings in the area of the appellant's parents\u2019 home prompted police surveillance of the area. The police began to watch the appellant and his brother, Christopher, after seeing them drive a black Porshe 944 or a Jeep Cherokee with tinted windows on a number of occasions in August, September, October and November of 1992.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b340-7\">.

On the day of the search and seizure, Christopher, who still lived at the premises, approached the house a short time after the appellant arrived. A pager and $268.00 in cash were seized from his person. Although no illegal substances were seized from him, Christopher had previously sold crack cocaine to one of the police department\u2019s \"confidential sources\" during a controlled buy.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b340-9\">.

The record reflects that, when court convened, counsel for both the appellant and Christopher were present, but neither client was. The appellant was brought into the courtroom shortly thereafter, however. When Christopher's attorney asked, \"Does Your Honor want me to get Christopher Bhagwat?,\u201d he was informed, \"He is not on trial.\u201d The proceeding then continued. Thus the record does not reflect that Christopher was present during these proceedings.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b342-9\">. Appellant\u2019s counsel understood that the plea agreement \"was simply that Chris Bhagwat would not assert in the trial of Roger Bhagwat as to his ownership of the drugs and that was it.\u201d Thus, he proposed to limit his inquiry as indicated. He did not believe that the fact that drugs were found in the coat that was identified as Christopher\u2019s and about which he intended to inquire, precluded that inquiry.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b342-10\">.

In Maryland the privilege is guaranteed by Article 22 of the Declaration of Rights of the Maryland Constitution, which states \u201d[t]hat no man ought to be compelled to give evidence against himself in a criminal case.\u201d Likewise, the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution provides, in pertinent part, that \"no person ... shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself....\u201d The Fifth <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>Amendment is of course applicable to Maryland via the Fourteenth Amendment. <em>See Malloy v.

Moreover, both the state and the federal privilege are available in any type of proceeding, not just criminal. <em>See, e.g., Lefkowitz v. Turley, </em>414 U.S. 70, 77, 94 S.Ct. 316, 322, 38 L.Ed.2d 274, 281 (1973) (privilege protects individual \u201cin any ... proceeding, civil or criminal, formal or informal, where the answers might incriminate him [or her] in future criminal proceedings\u201d); <em>Whitaker v.

According to <em>McCormick on Evidence, </em>\u00a7 136, at 335 (E. Cleary 3d ed. 1984), \u201c[t]he rationale for requiring a witness to submit to questioning and to assert the privilege if he [or she] desires to invoke it is that the nature of the privilege so requires.\u201d Thus,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-7\">[s]ince the privilege is applicable only if the specific response would come within the scope of protection and the witness is not the ultimate arbiter of whether this is the situation, a decision on the propriety of invoking it cannot be made unless the question has been put and the witness has asserted his [or her] basis for refusal to answer. Of course, this procedure endangers to some extent the values which the privilege is designed to protect. Subjecting a witness to a series of questions to which he [or she] must respond by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>invoking the privilege is somewhat akin to the interrogation which the privilege has historically sought to protect against. Requiring that the witness make a question-by-question judgment on the legal necessity of responding creates a danger that the privilege will not be invoked because of confusion or physical exhaustion rather than the knowing and intentional decision not to invoke it required for a waiver of a constitutional right. Against these dangers, however, must be weighed the public interest in obtaining as much information as possible without directly infringing on the witness\u2019s protected rights.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b344-8\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b345-7\">. We wish to emphasize the fact that the questioning of the witness should not occur in front of the jury. This is so because of the potential for prejudice that this presents.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b347-9\">. The courts in <em>People v. Fryer, </em>247 Ill.App.3d 1051, 187 Ill.Dec. 786, 795, 618 N.E.2d 377, 386 (1993), and <em>United States </em>v. <em>Bell, </em>506 F.2d 207, 222 (D.C.Cir.1974), found the defendant\u2019s allegations, under the facts of those cases, to be without substance. In <em>Jones v. United States, </em>386 A.2d 308, 315-16 (D.C.App.1978), the court held the issue to be unpreserved and not cognizable as plain error.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b349-6\">. The State also notes that in <em>Allen v. State, </em>318 Md. 166, 567 A.2d 118 (1989), this Court recognized that it may be improper to knowingly call a witness in order to have that witness invoke the privilege against self-incrimination in front of the jury. Our express holding was:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A2i\">under most circumstances, it is improper for a prosecutor to require a witness to claim his [or her] privilege against self-incrimination in the presence of the jury when ... the prosecutor knows or has reason to anticipate that the witness will assert the privilege in front of the jury-</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b349-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 174, 567 A.2d at 122. We explained the policy underlying the holding as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-9\">When a witness\u2019s refusal to testify is the only source of the inference that the witness engaged in criminal activity with the defendant, and the refusal is also a material part of the prosecution\u2019s case, then any improper inferences drawn from that refusal carry a 'critical weight\u2019 and justify a reversal.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b349-10\"><em>Id. </em>at 179, 567 A.2d at 124. The test, therefore, \u201cis whether the State\u2019s Attorney calls the witness for the effect of the claim of privilege on the jury.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 176, 567 A.2d at 123 (quoting <em>Vandegrift v. State, </em>237 Md. 305, 309, 206 A.2d 250, 253 (1965)). This policy applies equally when it is the trial judge, rather than the prosecutor, that calls the witness. <em>See Allen </em>at 177, 567 A.2d at 123.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b351-6\">. Whether, when the \"personal\u201d privilege of the witness is invoked by the attorney, without the witness even being present, a trial court's refusal to comply with the <em>Richardson </em>procedure is a mere technicality is far from clear. Ordinarily, when this Court has characterized a right as \"personal,\u201d we have meant that the right must be exercised by the beneficiary of the right, not by his or her representative. <em>See, e.g., State v. Kenney, </em>327 Md. 354, 361-62, 609 A.2d 337, 341 (1992); <em>Treece v. State, </em>313 Md. 665, 681, 547 A.2d 1054, 1062 (1988). <em>Midgett </em>is not inconsistent with this principle. There the trial court spoke with the witness, himself, and ascertained the witness\u2019s intention to invoke his privilege against self-incrimination. It was only the oath that was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>missing in that case. Here, more than the oath is missing; the witness is missing. Consequently, in this case the privilege has truly been asserted, as far as the Court knows, by the witness\u2019s counsel.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b352-6\">. The inquiry must be conducted with the recognition that \u2019\u2019[o]nce the State extracts a promise not to testify as a condition of a plea agreement, it is practically impossible to determine whether a witness refused to testify because of the privilege against self-incrimination or because of a desire to perform the promise.\" <em>Fort, </em>501 A.2d at 144.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b353-6\">. The appellant's counsel had a somewhat different understanding of the plea agreement than did the court and the witness's counsel. He believed that the agreement simply required the witness to refrain from claiming, in his brother\u2019s case, that the drugs seized from the premises were his drugs. The trial court did not resolve that difference of understanding. For purposes of this case, however, we may rely upon the characterization of the agreement by the witness\u2019s attorney and by the court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b354-8\">. The State proffered in its brief that \"numerous other witnesses testified to this effect.\u201d State's brief at 14. This is not correct. Other than the testimony by the appellant and his father, the appellant's girlfriend\u2019s mother and a friend testified on this subject. They were able to testify only as to appellant\u2019s use or ownership of an old Oldsmobile. The appellant\u2019s girlfriend\u2019s mother testified that she did not know anything else about any other vehicles. The appellant\u2019s friend was not even asked whether the appellant owned any other vehicles.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b355-6\">. At the sentencing hearing, the appellant\u2019s counsel expressed his belief that the appellant\u2019s conviction \"really stems from the belief of Detective Herbert, the jury\u2019s belief of Detective Herbert that he found a single bag of, which was disputed testimony, of cocaine by the search of the person of Roger Bhagwat.\u201d At the same hearing the trial court expressed a similar view when it observed that \"... the jury did not find you guilty of the gun and the paraphernalia in the back bedroom.
