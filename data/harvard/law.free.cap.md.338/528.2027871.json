Regrettably, the response of the party calling the expert medical witness to adverse rulings by the trial court prevents our reaching this most interesting issue. We shall hold, instead, that the election of Istvan Osztreicher, the appellant and plaintiff below, to refrain from presenting a case was an acquiescence in, or consent to, the adverse judgment subsequently entered against him. Accordingly, we shall dismiss the appellant\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-9\">This is a medical malpractice action arising out of alleged negligently performed vascular surgery, which resulted in permanent and irreversible ischemic spinal cord and neurological injury, including a permanent loss of bowel and bladder control. As required by Maryland Code (1974, 1995 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 3-2A-04 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article, it was filed initially in the Health Claims Arbitration Office.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The appellant named as defendants, Juan M. Juante<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>guy, M.D., the appellee, Ramon Vasquez, M.D., and Sinai Hospital of Baltimore.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> While the matter was pending in Health Claims Arbitration, pursuant to \u00a7 3-2A-04, the appellant named three expert medical witnesses, including Dr. Stewart Battle, whose withdrawal as a witness is at the heart of this case. Prior to Dr. Battle\u2019s deposition being taken, however, the appellant informed the appellee that the appellant \u201c[did] not intend to call Dr. Battle forward at the Health Claims Arbitration hearing.\u201d Thereafter, the parties agreed pursuant to \u00a7 3-2A-06A, to waive health claims arbitration, whereupon, the case was filed in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b603-4\">The appellant did not thereafter provide the appellee with any additional designation of experts, although there was correspondence from the appellee to the appellant on the subject. Appellant\u2019s letter to the appellee asking the appellee to provide two dates if he intended to depose Dr. Battle prompted a motion by the appellee to exclude Dr. Battle\u2019s testimony. The circuit court denied that motion. Dr. Battle thereafter was deposed by the appellee three days prior to trial. During the deposition, he was asked the amount of income he derived from forensic activity, to which he gave an approximate figure. Appellant interposed no objection to that line of inquiry. Two days later, one day before trial, the appellee served Dr. Battle with a trial subpoena, commanding him to produce:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>[a]ny and all written documents, records, notes, correspondence, tax forms, and/or 1099 forms containing, referring to or reflecting income or monies received in the last two years for medical/legal and/or forensic activities, including but not limited to the review of medical records on behalf of a patient or health care provider or appearance at deposition, arbitration and/or trial on behalf of a patient and/or health care provider.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b604-4\">The appellant immediately filed a motion to quash the trial subpoena.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-5\">After a jury had been empaneled and opening statements made, the trial court considered the appellant\u2019s motion to quash. After hearing argument, the court denied the motion. It ruled:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-6\">I\u2019m going to order, Dr. Battle, that you produce the income tax returns and the 1099 forms, or what of your other supporting documentation there is, to verify the income received from forensic activities.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-7\">I will propose to review that in camera. I don\u2019t know whether it\u2019s the anticipation by the defense that they would want to introduce these documents, but it seems to me that certainly Mr. Ellin is correct that defense can inquire about those areas, but without seeing the backup and support documentation, I think the cross-examination would become somewhat without course and without verification.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-8\">So I\u2019m going to order, Mr. Ellin, that Dr. Battle produce the documents requested. I will review those.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b604-9\">Objecting most strenuously to the court\u2019s ruling, the appellant moved for a mistrial, asserting, \u201ceffectively \u2014 effectively\u2014I\u2019m not able to put on this case and that\u2019s tantamount because Dr. Battle has told [me] this morning if his and his wife\u2019s privacy are infringed upon, he will not testify in this case.\u201d He concluded that, \u201cunless you grant a mistrial, ... you\u2019ll be granting a summary judgment for failure of going forward. Without Dr. Battle, I cannot present this case.\u201d The mistrial motion was denied, the court concluding \u201cnot [to] grant a mistrial in this situation because your witness does not wish to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>disclose and you do not wish to proceed, asking him to testify.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b605-5\">The appellant elected not to present any evidence. He explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b605-6\">I don\u2019t have a case to present. My ease has been decimated by the witness\u2019 refusal under the terms that the Court has set to go forward as a matter of personal principle of the witness and his view that his rights are violated.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b605-7\">He also stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b605-8\">It would be folly of the highest degree for me to believe that I have any chance of properly representing the plaintiff with one witness who is retired from surgery at the present time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b605-9\">I have to deal with the reality of some 30 years\u2019 experience in trial, most of it in medical malpractice, to know that I\u2019m not going to help my client. I\u2019m going to spend a lot of time and money for naught.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b605-10\">There is no way in this world I can go forward with one expert in this case and he, that one expert, retired from active surgical practice.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b605-11\">So your Honor will simply have to, as I\u2019m sure you will anyway, take whatever or make whatever ruling you want and this is going to be \u2014 and I suppose it was inevitable that the Court of Appeals would have to deal with this issue sooner or later.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b605-12\">Since the appellant rested his case without presenting any evidence in support of his case, the trial court granted the appellee\u2019s motion for judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>The appellant noted an appeal to the Court of Special Appeals. We issued a writ of certiorari on our own motion, prior to that court\u2019s consideration of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-4\">It is well settled in Maryland that \u201c[t]he right' to appeal may be lost by acquiescence in, or recognition of, the validity of the decision below from which the appeal is taken or by otherwise taking a position which is inconsistent with the right of appeal.\u201d <em>Rocks v. Brosius, </em>241 Md. 612, 630, 217 A.2d 531, 541 (1966). <em>See Franzen v. Dubinok, </em>290 Md. 65, 68, 427 A.2d 1002, 1004 (1981); <em>Bowers v. Soper, </em>148 Md. 695, 697-98, 130 A. 330, 330-31 (1925); <em>Stewart v. McCaddin, </em>107 Md. 314, 318-19, 68 A. 571, 573 (1908). Applying this principle, it has been held that a litigant \u201ccannot, knowing the facts, both voluntarily accept the benefits of a judgment or decree and then later be heard to question its validity on appeal.\u201d <em>Suburban Development Corp. v. Perryman, </em>281 Md. 168, 171, 377 A.2d 1164, 1165 (1977). <em>See Kneas v. Hecht Company, </em>257 Md. 121, 123-24, 262 A.2d 518, 520 (1970); <em>Dubin v. Mobile Land Corp., </em>250 Md. 349, 353, 243 A.2d 585, 587 (1968); <em>State, Use of Shipley v. Walker, </em>230 Md. 133, 137-38, 186 A.2d 472, 474 (1962); <em>Turner v. Washington Suburban Sanitary Commission, </em>221 Md. 494, 505, 158 A.2d 125, 131 (1960); <em>Armour Fertilizer Works v. Brown, </em>185 Md. 273, 278-280, 44 A.2d 753, 755-56 (1945). This rule has also been applied to consent judgments. <em>See Globe American Casualty Company v. Chung, </em>322 Md. 713, 716-17, 589 A.2d 956, 957 (1991); <em>Banegura v. Taylor, </em>312 Md. 609, 615, 541 A.2d 969, 972 (1988); <em>Long v. Runyeon, </em>285 Md. 425, 429-30, 403 A.2d 785, 788 (1979); <em>Mercantile Trust Company v. Schloss, </em>165 Md. 18, 24, 166 A. 599, 601 (1933); <em>Emersonian Apartments v. Taylor, </em>132 Md. 209, 213-14, 103 A. 423, 424 (1918). Acquiescence implies consent, although by no means express consent. <em>See </em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 22 (5th ed. 1979) (defining \u201cacquiesce\u201d as \u201c[t]o give an implied consent to a transaction, to the accrual of a right, or to any act, by one\u2019s mere silence, or without express assent or acknowledgement\u201d); <em>Banegura v. Taylor, supra, </em>312 Md. at 615, 541 A.2d at 972; <em>Lohss and Sprenkle v. State, </em>272 Md. 113, 118-19, 321 A.2d 534, 538 (1974); <em>R.E.C. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number><em>Management Corp. v. Bakst Service, Inc., </em>265 Md. 238, 251, 289 A.2d 285, 291 (1972); <em>Rocks v. Brosius, supra, </em>241 Md. at 630, 217 A.2d at 541. It has been held that a litigant who acquiesces in a ruling is completely deprived of the right to complain about that ruling. <em>Blaxton v. Clemens, </em>202 Ga.App. 668, 415 S.E.2d 304, 306 (1992). A party who does not offer evidence on an issue as to which that party has the burden of proof acquiesces in the adverse judgment entered on that issue. <em>Bell v. Bell, </em>248-S.W.2d 978, 992 (Tx.Ct.App.1952). <em>See Considine v. Considine, </em>726 S.W.2d 253, 254 (Tex.Ct.App.1987); <em>see also Hense v. G.D. Searle &amp; Co., </em>452 N.W.2d 440, 444-45 (Iowa 1990) (a party inviting a final judgment waives right to appeal); <em>Frankfurt v. Bunn, </em>408 P.2d 785, 787-88 (Okla.1965) (failure to controvert or contradict evidence is acquiescence in that evidence).</p>\n<p id=\"b607-4\">The trial court\u2019s denial of the appellant\u2019s motion to quash, coupled with the appellant\u2019s preferred expert withdrawing from the case, left the appellant with but one expert, a retired surgeon, upon whom to rely to prove the appellant\u2019s medical malpractice. Nevertheless, neither that ruling nor the court\u2019s subsequent denial of the appellant\u2019s motion for mistrial prevented the appellant from presenting a credible, even if not a strong, case; although the strength of appellant\u2019s case may have been affected, perhaps significantly, by the inability to use his preferred expert, rather than his ability to present a case, it was the appellant\u2019s perceived inability <em>successfully </em>to present a case that prompted him to elect not to go forward. The issue is not, however, whether the case successfully could have been presented, but whether the court\u2019s ruling left the appellant with <em>no </em>case to present. The effect of the appellant\u2019s not presenting a case was that a final judgment was entered against him, thus, clearing the way for him to challenge the trial court\u2019s adverse rulings on appeal. Indeed, that was his purpose. By so doing, however, he acquiesced in, if not consented to, the entry of that judgment. Under our cases, as we have seen, he may not now appeal and obtain review of those rulings.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>We shall dismiss the appellant\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"Ahy\">\n<em>APPEAL DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b608-5\">\n<em>COSTS TO BE PAID BY THE APPELLANT.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b602-10\">. Section 3-2A-04(a) provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-11\">(1) A person having a claim against a health care provider for damages due to a medical injury shall file his claim with the Director [of the Health Claims Arbitration Office], and, if the claim is against a physician, the Director shall forward copies of the claim to the State Board of Physician Quality Assurance and the Medical and Chirurgical Faculty of the State of Maryland.... The health care provider shall file a response with the Director and serve a copy on the claimant and all other health care providers named therein within the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>time provided in the Maryland Rules for filing a responsive pleading to a complaint. The claim and the response may include a statement that the matter in controversy falls within one or more particular recognized specialties.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b603-6\">. In an amended statement of claim, the appellant named only the appellee and Sinai Hospital, thus dismissing any claim against Vasquez. Later, while the case was pending in the circuit court, the appellant dismissed, with prejudice, Sinai Hospital as a defendant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b603-7\">. Section 3-2A-06A(a) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-8\">(a) In general. \u2014 At anytime before the hearing of a claim with the Health Claims Arbitration Office, the parties may agree mutually to waive arbitration of the claim, and the provisions of this subsection then shall govern all further proceedings on the claim.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b605-13\">. After the court had indicated that it would not grant a mistrial, the appellant appeared to be willing to abide by the court\u2019s discovery ruling, going so far as to indicate a willingness to make phone calls to locate the information and have it faxed to the court. When the court recessed for that purpose, apparently the expert witness discussed the matter with the appellant\u2019s counsel and determined not to disclose and, thus, not to testify. Dr. Battle proffered his reasons for that decision to the court, which prompted another discussion of the propriety of a grant of a mistrial. Ultimately, the court reiterated its prior ruling.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
