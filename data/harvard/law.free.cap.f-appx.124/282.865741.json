Cebryk\u2019s complaint alleged that VECO tortiously interfered with his relationship with his employer, Parsons Engineering &amp; Chemicals. We AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-17\">A district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment is reviewed de novo, using the same standards as the district court. <em>Union Pac. Res. Group, Inc. v. Rhone Poulenc, Inc., </em>247 F.3d 574, 583 (5th Cir.2001). A movant is entitled to summary judgment when \u201cthe pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\u201d FED. R. CIV. P. 56(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b314-21\">To recover for the allegedly tortious interference with his employment relationship, Cebryk had to plead and prove: (1) an employment contract or relationship subject to interference, (2) willful and intentional interference, (3) that proximately caused his injuries and (4) actual damage or loss. <em>Prudential Insurance Company of America v. Financial Review Services, Inc., </em>29 S.W.3d 74, 77 (Tex.2000). For essentially the reasons given by the district court, we conclude that Cebryk has not submitted evidence sufficient to establish a genuine issue of material fact on the elements of intentionality or proximate causation.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Alternatively, we agree with the district court that VECO has demonstrated that it is entitled to summary judgment on its affirmative defense of legal justification.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-22\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b314-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b314-19\"><em>. </em>The plaintiff attached certain materials to his notice of appeal. Our review, however, is limited to the summary judgment record. <em>Wallace v. Texas Tech. Univ., </em>80 F.3d 1042, 1047 (5th Cir. 1996) citing <em>Little v. Liquid Air Corp., </em>37 F.3d 1069, 1071, n. 1 (5th Cir.1994) (en banc).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
