H. Caffey Distributing Co., Inc., and principal Christopher Caffey (collectively \u201cCaffey\u201d), appeals the district court\u2019s ruling on summary judgment that he is not entitled to overtime benefits pursuant to the Fair Labor Standards Act (the \u201cFLSA\u201d), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 201-219. <em>See </em>Order and Judgment at 1 (April 16, 2004), adopting Order and Recommendation of United States Magistrate Judge (March II, 2004) (the \u201cOpinion\u201d). The district court agreed with Caffey that Tait\u00f3n transported goods in interstate commerce, impheating the Motor Carrier Act exception to the FLSA 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 213(b)(1), and precluding his claim for benefits. Opinion at 14. For the reasons that follow, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-18\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-19\">Caffey is headquartered in Guilford County, North Carolina, and licensed by the North Carolina Alcoholic Beverage Control Commission (\u201cABCC\u201d) as the exclusive distributor of certain beer products, including those manufactured by Miller, Coors, Heineken, Guinness, St. Pauli, and Pabst, for several North Carolina counties. During the relevant time period, Caffey\u2019s warehouse in Greensboro sold approximately 3,400,000 cases and 18,000 kegs of beer per year. Approximately fifty percent of that volume was either produced at the Miher plant in Eden, North Carolina, or produced by Miller outside <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"762\">*762</page-number>the state and transshipped at the Eden plant. Approximately ten percent was produced at and shipped directly from the Miller plant in Albany, Georgia; twenty percent was produced at or transshipped from the Coors plant in Elkton, Virginia; and the remaining twenty percent was produced at and shipped from various manufacturers\u2019 plants outside North Carolina or outside the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-4\">Wholesalers like Caffey are prohibited by the North Carolina Administrative Code from requiring a retailer to purchase their beer pursuant to a contractual purchase agreement. N.C. Admin. Code tit. 4, r. 2T.0706. However, by virtue of its ABCC license, Caffey and other wholesalers are nonetheless required to meet the orders of retailers in their assigned distribution areas, regardless of account size or distance from the warehouse. <em>Id. </em>at r. 02T.0610. Caffey\u2019s sales representatives must therefore estimate how much product a retailer will need on the next delivery, sometimes by talking to retailer managers, and, if the manager is unavailable, through analyzing sales data and determining, based on a retailer\u2019s current inventory and sales history, how much beer should be ordered. The representatives promptly enter the estimated quantity for those retailers into handheld devices that transmit orders electronically to Caffey\u2019s warehouse in Greensboro.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-5\">Turnover among licensed retailers in Caffey\u2019s geographical area is less than five percent per year, so Caffey\u2019s customers are a stable group. Tait\u00f3n testified by affidavit that each retailer to which he delivered typically had a certain amount of display space allocated to Caffey products, and that this space allocation \u201cdid not change.\u201d Tait\u00f3n Second Aff. at H 9. The frequency of deliveries and amount of product in each delivery fluctuated. <em>Id. </em>at K19.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-6\">Tait\u00f3n began working for Caffey as a \u201cdriver/sales representative\u201d on September 15, 1998. On February 25, 2000, he was assigned to a \u201cswing-route driver\u201d position. As a swing-route driver, Tait\u00f3n did not have any pre-assigned routes, but instead filled in as needed on any route that was missing a driver. All of Talton\u2019s routes were in North Carolina, though he once crossed into Virginia briefly while en route to a North Carolina distributor situated near the North Carolina/Virginia state line.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-7\">At each of the retailer locations, Talton\u2019s duties included printing an invoice for the beer delivered, obtaining the retailer\u2019s approval for the beer, unloading it, pricing it, stocking it, and securing payment. Drivers such as Tait\u00f3n also sometimes returned kegs used by the retailers to Caffey\u2019s warehouse, which Caffey returned to the manufacturers for credit, reuse, and recycling. After suffering an on-the-job injury, Tait\u00f3n ceased performing the duties of a swing-route driver for Caffey on June 11, 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-8\">On November 29, 2002, Tait\u00f3n filed a complaint against Caffey in the Middle District of North Carolina, alleging that Caffey had failed to pay him all regular and overtime wages when due, in contravention of the FLSA and the North Carolina Wage and Hour Act (\u201cNCWHA\u201d), N.C. GemStat. \u00a7\u00a7 95-25.1 <em>et seq. </em>He sought a declaratory judgment, compensatory damages, and liquidated damages, plus interest, attorney\u2019s fees, and costs. In its Answer, Caffey contended that it was exempt, from both the FLSA and NCWHA as to Tait\u00f3n because of the interstate nature of Talton\u2019s duties, <em>see </em>Amended Answer at 4-5, and that in the event that it was not exempt, its actions were in good faith. <em>Id. </em>at 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-9\">After discovery was conducted, both parties moved for summary judgment on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"763\">*763</page-number>Talton\u2019s FLSA claim for unpaid overtime wages under \u00a7 207(a)(1). On April 16, 2004, in adopting the magistrate judge\u2019s recommendations, the district court denied Talton\u2019s motion for summary judgment and granted Caffey\u2019s. Order and Judgment at 1-2. The court reasoned that though Talton\u2019s delivery was solely intrastate, the beer itself was an article travel-ling in interstate commerce, making the Motor Carrier Act applicable and thus exempting Caffey from the FLSA\u2019s overtime requirements.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See </em>Opinion at 10-13. Tait\u00f3n filed a timely notice of appeal, and we possess jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-6\">On appeal, Tait\u00f3n contends that the Opinion utilized and applied incorrect legal principles, impermissibly resolved issues of disputed fact, and applied the legal standard to the facts incorrectly. We review a district court's award of summary judgment de novo, viewing the facts and drawing all inferences in the light most favorable to the non-moving party. <em>See Seabulk Offshore, Ltd. v. Am. Home </em>As<em>surance Co., </em>377 F.3d 408, 418 (4th Cir. 2004). An award of summary judgment is appropriate only \u201cif the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c). A genuine issue of material fact is one \u201cthat might affect the outcome of the suit under the governing law.\u201d <em>Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., </em>477 U.S. 242, 248, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986). Because we find no error in the judgment, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-9\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-10\">The FLSA establishes a forty-hour workweek for covered employees and provides for compensation at time-and-a-half for those weekly hours in excess of forty. Section 207(a)(1) provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b795-11\">[N]o employer shall employ any of his employees who in any workweek is engaged in commerce or in the production of goods for commerce, or is employed in an enterprise engaged in commerce or in the production of goods for commerce, for a workweek longer than forty hours unless such employee receives compensation for his employment in excess of the hours above specified at a rate not less than one and one-half times the regular rate at which he is employed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b795-12\">29 U.S.C. \u00a7 207(a)(1). To establish a claim for unpaid overtime wages, Tait\u00f3n must establish by a preponderance of the evidence (1) that he worked overtime hours without compensation, (2) the \u201camount and extent\u201d of the work \u201cas a matter of just and reasonable inference,\u201d and (3) that Caffey knew of the uncompensated overtime. <em>See Anderson v. Mt. Clemens Pottery Co., </em>328 U.S. 680, 687, 66 S.Ct. 1187, 90 L.Ed. 1515 (1946); <em>see also Davis v. Food Lion, </em>792 F.2d 1274, 1276 (4th Cir. 1986). Talton must also show that Caffey <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"764\">*764</page-number>was an enterprise engaged in interstate commerce. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 207(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b796-4\">In his motion for summary judgment as to liability, Tait\u00f3n maintained that the undisputed facts established each of these elements. Caffey admits that it is engaged in interstate commerce, that Tait\u00f3n worked overtime during the relevant period, and that he was not paid overtime wages during that time. The Opinion accordingly concluded that Tait\u00f3n had made a prima facie showing of his entitlement to overtime compensation. Opinion at 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-5\">Caffey maintained, however, that Talton\u2019s employment was exempt from the FLSA under the Motor Carrier Act exemption, set forth at 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 213(b)(1). That exemption provides that the FLSA overtime requirements do not apply to \u201cany employee with respect to whom the Secretary of Transportation has power to establish qualifications and maximum hours of service pursuant to the provisions of section 31502 of Title 49 [the Motor Carrier Act].\u201d <em>Id, </em>The Motor Carrier Act gives the Secretary of Transportation jurisdiction, <em>inter alia, </em>over interstate transportation by a motor carrier, 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 13501, and authority to establish qualifications and maximum hours of service for covered employees. 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 31502. Courts have interpreted this authority to extend not just to carriers who actually cross state lines while transporting goods, but also to carriers whose cargo originates from outside the state or is ultimately bound for a destination outside the state, even where the carrier\u2019s route is entirely intrastate. <em>See, e.g., Bilyou v. Dutchess Beer Distrib., </em>300 F.3d 217, 223 (2d Cir. 2002); <em>Merck Fast Motor Lines, Inc., v. I.C.C., </em>528 F.2d 1042, 1044 (5th Cir.1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b796-6\">Caffey contends that Tait\u00f3n is covered by the Motor Carrier Act, and thus exempt from the provisions of the FLSA, because the beer Tait\u00f3n carried and delivered was an item in interstate commerce. Tait\u00f3n counters that the beer he carried and delivered on his intrastate delivery routes had ceased to be an item in interstate commerce, and for that reason he does not fall within the Motor Carrier Act exemption. Thus, Tait\u00f3n argues, he is covered by the FLSA and entitled to overtime pay.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-8\">The question, then, is simple: whether the beer\u2019s pause in Caffey\u2019s Greensboro warehouse was of such a character as to bring its interstate journey to an end. In <em>Walling v. Jacksonville Paper Co., </em>317 U.S. 564, 63 S.Ct. 332, 87 L.Ed. 460 (1943), the Supreme Court analyzed whether goods imported from outside the state by a wholesaler for in-state sale, and temporarily stored in a warehouse before subsequent movement to their in-state destination, are nevertheless still items in interstate commerce during the second, instate leg of their journey. The Court identified and discussed three possible fact patterns for assessing the interstate commerce issue: (1) where items were ordered pursuant to a pre-existing contract with a specific customer; (2) where items were ordered pursuant to a pre-existing understanding with a customer, though not pursuant to a written contract; and (3) where items were ordered in anticipation of the needs of customers. 317 U.S. at 335-36;. <em>see also Galbreath v. Gulf Oil Corp., </em>413 F.2d 941, 945 (5th Cir.1969) (listing three <em>Jacksonville Paper </em>fact patterns); <em>Allesandro v. C.F. Smith Co., </em>136 F.2d 75, 77 (6th Cir.1943) (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b796-9\">Tait\u00f3n maintains that our Circuit has interpreted and applied the principles of <em>Jacksonville Paper </em>narrowly, such that \u201cinterstate\u201d movement will continue after temporary stoppage at a warehouse only if a specific customer has \u201cordered the goods.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Br. at 11 (quoting <em>Schroepfer v. A.S. Abell Co., </em>138 F.2d 111, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"765\">*765</page-number>114 (4th Cir.1943)). Tait\u00f3n contends that, because of this narrow interpretation, the district court used the incorrect legal standard when it relied on authorities from the Fifth and Sixth Circuits, embodied in the <em>Galbreath </em>and <em>Allesandro </em>decisions. Opinion at 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-5\">On careful analysis, we see Talton\u2019s contention on this point as without merit. First, contrary to what Tait\u00f3n maintains, we did not broadly conclude in <em>Schroepfer </em>that the in-state leg of a shipment of goods from outside the state is not in interstate commerce unless in-state customers have previously \u201cordered the goods.\u201d Rather, <em>Schroepfer </em>merely used the phrase \u201cordered the goods\u201d to characterize how the facts of <em>Jacksonville Paper </em>differed from a companion case, <em>Higgins v. Carr Bros. Co., </em>317 U.S. 572, 63 S.Ct. 337, 87 L.Ed. 468 (1943). <em>See Schroepfer, </em>138 F.2d at 114. Nor was the fact that no customer had \u201cordered the goods\u201d in <em>Schroepfer </em>deemed to be dispositive. Rather, in <em>Schroepfer, </em>the product at issue was a newspaper, and two employees, whose jobs were to distribute newspapers to racks and vendors, sued the publishing company for minimum wages and overtime, on the theory that their employment was in interstate commerce because the newspaper gathered out-of-state news and used it to produce the newspaper. We simply determined that the defendant\u2019s newspaper business was not the sale of the interstate news, as would be the business of a \u201ctelegraph company or a news service,\u201d because the company took the interstate news and used it as it saw fit to create a new product, a newspaper, which the plaintiffs distributed. <em>Id. </em>As a result, the intrastate distribution of locally produced newspapers was not \u201cso closely related to the movement of the [interstate] commerce\u201d as to cause the distribution of the papers to constitute interstate activity. <em>Id. </em>at 113-14. Put simply, we neither discarded nor narrowed the <em>Jacksonville Paper </em>categories. As a result, the decisions of the Fifth and Sixth Circuits in <em>Galbreath </em>and <em>Allesandro, </em>relied on in the Opinion, are not, as maintained by Tait\u00f3n, \u201cmaterially different\u201d from the applicable principles in this Circuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-7\">Further, Talton\u2019s contention that the products that he carried could not remain in interstate commerce because they were not specifically ordered by Caffey\u2019s customers contravenes <em>Jacksonville Paper </em>itself. There, the Supreme Court recognized that goods could be ordered pursuant to an \u201cunderstanding,\u201d though not part of a specific order. 317 U.S. at 568. The Court also explicitly left open the possibility that shipments purchased in <em>anticipation </em>of the needs of certain customers might remain in interstate commerce when delivered in-state, observing that \u201ca wholesaler\u2019s course of business based on anticipation of needs of specific customers, rather than on prior orders or contracts,\u201d might \u201cat times be sufficient to establish that practical continuity in transit necessary to keep a movement of goods \u2018in commerce.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 570. Here, the district court recognized that the products delivered by Tait\u00f3n were ordered by Caffey pursuant to an \u201cunderstanding\u201d implied by law, were ordered to meet the needs of \u201cspecific customers,\u201d and thus were within the second <em>Jacksonville Paper </em>fact pattern. <em>See </em>Opinion at 10-13. This analysis correctly utilized the applicable legal standard. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b797-8\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-9\">Next, Tait\u00f3n contends that the district court, in rendering summary judgment, impermissibly resolved issues of disputed fact. Though the Opinion relied on what the magistrate judge repeatedly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"766\">*766</page-number>characterized as \u201cundisputed facts,\u201d <em>see, e.g., </em>Opinion at 8, 11, 12 n. 7, Tait\u00f3n maintains that the \u201cundisputed facts\u201d were in fact disputed.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-4\">This contention, while less clear than the legal standard issue, is also without merit. Though the Opinion did recite some facts that Tait\u00f3n, on appeal,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> characterizes as disputed, the pivotal point for the court was the very nature of the ABCC statutes and the exclusive relationship that those statutes establish between a beer wholesaler and a beer retailer. The fact of the ABCC statutes\u2019 existence and their terms were not in dispute, and thus the court did not improperly resolve disputed issues of fact when it granted summary judgment. <em>See Griffin v. Consol. Foods Corp., </em>771 F.2d 826, 828 (4th Cir.1985) (affirming determination of applicability of Motor Carrier Act exemption based on undisputed facts).</p>\n<p id=\"b798-5\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-6\">Finally, the district court correctly determined that the products handled and distributed by Tait\u00f3n continued to be in interstate commerce even though they had temporarily paused at the Greensboro warehouse. The Opinion observed that the relationship detailed in the first category of <em>Jacksonville Paper, </em>delivery pursuant to written contract, was unavailable to Caffey because the ABCC statutes prohibit a beer wholesaler from entering into a written contract with a beer retailer. Opinion at 13. The Opinion then concluded, as to the second category of <em>Jacksonville Paper, </em>that, \u201c[c]learly, by operation of North Carolina\u2019s ABC law, the licensed retailers had an \u2018understanding\u2019 with [Caffey] that [Caffey] was required to provide them with enough beer to meet their sales needs.\u201d Opinion at 12. The Opinion reached this conclusion despite the fact that Caffey ordered quantities of beer without specific orders from its retailers because Caffey, as the holder of a state-established monopoly for the wholesaling of beer products, was required to keep its retailers stocked with beer, and \u201cif [Caffey] breached its legal obligations to the licensed retailers, not only would it face potential contract damages, but also the revocation of its business license.\u201d Opinion at 13. As a result, the district court properly concluded that the \u201cimplied requirements contracts arising out of ABC law in this case are an even stronger legal relationship than most express requirements contracts.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The beer products carried in-state by Tait\u00f3n were \u201cdifferent from goods acquired and held by a local merchant for local disposition.\u201d <em>Jacksonville Paper, </em>317 U.S. at 570. We agree with the reasoning of the district court on this point, <em>see </em>Opinion at 8-14, and we are content to adopt it.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-9\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-10\">Pursuant to the foregoing, the summary judgment award of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-11\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b795-7\">. Caffey also moved for summary judgment on Talton's NCWHA claim for unpaid wages, arguing that Tait\u00f3n was not entitled to the unpaid wages under the NCWHA, and that his employment was not covered by the NCWHA. The district court granted this motion as well, adopting the magistrate judge\u2019s assessment that \u201cevidence before the Court demonstrates that Defendants' deduction of cash shortages from Plaintiff\u2019s paychecks met all of the NCWHA\u2019s statutory and regulatory requirements.\u201d Opinion at 16. The magistrate judge also recommended that the district court deny a number of motions from both sides as moot. Opinion at 18. Tait\u00f3n has appealed the FLSA ruling only.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b798-7\">. Talton\u2019s disputed issues of fact contention on the Motor Carrier Act exemption is new. He did not assert to the magistrate judge that the facts underlying the application of the exemption were disputed, though he did maintain that facts related to other issues were in dispute. With regard to the Motor Carrier Act exemption, Tait\u00f3n argued solely that the application of the <em>Jacksonville Paper </em>doctrine to the facts showed that his employment was not in interstate commerce. PL's Mem. of Law in Opp. to Def.\u2019s Mot. for Summ. J. at 5-9. Moreover, he did not assert to the district court that the magistrate judge had erroneously based his recommended ruling on disputed issues of fact. <em>See </em>PL's Objections to Magistrate Judge\u2019s Order and Recommendation at 3-4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
