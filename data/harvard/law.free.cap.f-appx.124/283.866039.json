Lirley argues that the district court exceeded its authority because it made its own fact finding that substantial evidence supported the determination of the Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) that jobs that Lirley could perform existed in significant numbers in the national economy. A common-sense reading of the ALJ\u2019s findings, however, is that the ALJ determined that a significant number of inspector jobs, as well as a significant number of surveillance system monitor jobs, exist in the national economy.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-24\">Lirley also argues that the Commissioner failed to meet her burden of proof because evidence that a cumulative number of jobs exist in the national economy establishes neither the number of jobs existing in the claimant\u2019s region nor the number of geographic locations where the jobs exist. Under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 423(d)(2)(A) and 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1566, work exists in significant numbers in the national economy if it exists in significant numbers in either the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>region where the claimant lives or in other regions of the country. In light of the vocational expert\u2019s testimony that Lirley could perform the job of surveillance system monitor and that 50,000 such jobs exist in the national economy, substantial evidence supports the Commissioner\u2019s finding that Lirley is not entitled to Social Security disability benefits. <em>See Ripley v. Chater, </em>67 F.3d 552, 555 (5th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b316-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b315-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
