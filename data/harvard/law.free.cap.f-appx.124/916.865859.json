On appeal, the sole issue raised by de Paz is an assertion that the judgment contains a clerical error that must be corrected pursuant to Fed. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"917\">*917</page-number>R.CrimP. 36. De Paz contends that the judgment improperly states that he was adjudicated guilty of an offense under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a) and (b), when it should have reflected that his sentence arose solely under subsection (a). The government concurs in this assertion, and the district court has already amended the judgment on the government\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-5\">The error in question, however, was not a \u201cclerical error.\u201d A clerical error is one \u201carising from oversight or omission.\u201d Fed. R.CrimP. 36. De Paz was charged in the indictment with an offense under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a) and (b), and he pleaded guilty as charged in the indictment. The judgment\u2019s repetition of this charge does not constitute an \u201coversight or omission\u201d to be remedied under Fed.R.Crim.P. 36. As the \u201ccorrection\u201d occurred more than seven days after sentencing, it was not made pursuant to Fed.R.CrimP. 35(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b949-7\">The district court thus lacked jurisdiction to enter the amended judgment. The judgment of the district court is VACATED, and the case is REMANDED to the district court for entry of the appropriate judgment.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b948-24\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
