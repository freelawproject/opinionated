In No. 04-7597, Waverly K Hood seeks to appeal the district court\u2019s order dismissing as untimely his petition filed under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 (2000). An appeal may not be taken from the final order in a \u00a7 2254 proceeding unless a circuit justice or judge issues a certificate of appealability. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1) (2000). A certificate of appealability will not issue absent \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2) (2000). A prisoner satisfies this standard by demonstrating that reasonable jurists would find that his constitutional claims are debatable and that any dispositive procedural rulings by the district court are also debatable or wrong. <em>See Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 336, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003); <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000); <em>Rose v. Lee, </em>252 F.3d 676, 683 (4th Cir.2001). We have independently reviewed the record and conclude that Hood <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>has not made the requisite showing. Accordingly, we deny a certificate of appealability and dismiss this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-4\">In No. 05-6056, Hood appeals the district court\u2019s order construing his motion for a new trial as a \u00a7 2254 petition and dismissing it as successive and unauthorized. A certificate of appealability is required for our review of this appeal. <em>See Jones v. Braxton, </em>392 F.3d 683, 688-89 (4th Cir.2004). We have independently reviewed the record and conclude Hood has not made the requisite showing for issuance of a certificate of appealability. Accordingly, we deny a certificate of appealability, deny Hood\u2019s motion for preparation of a trial transcript at government expense, and dismiss this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">\n<em>DISMISSED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
