We have reviewed the record and the Board\u2019s order and find that the Board did not abuse its discretion in denying Basung\u2019s motion. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(a) (2004). Accordingly, we deny the petition for review on the reasoning of the Board. <em>See In re: Basung, </em>No. A79235-632 (B.I.A. Aug. 17, 2004). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-5\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
