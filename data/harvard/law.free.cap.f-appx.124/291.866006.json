Safraz Merchant and Soeen Merchant concede that their immigration status is dependent on whether Merchant is eligible for asylum. Merchant has waived the denial of her applications for withholding of removal and relief under the Convention Against Torture by failing to argue those issues. <em>Calderon-Ontiveros v. INS, </em>809 F.2d 1050, 1052 (5th Cir.1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b323-26\">This court will uphold the BIA\u2019s factual finding that an alien is not eligible for asylum if the determination is supported by substantial evidence. <em>Efe v. Ashcroft, </em>293 F.3d 899, 903 (5th Cir.2002). \u201cThe substantial evidence standard requires only that the Board\u2019s conclusion be based <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>upon the evidence presented and be substantially reasonable.\u201d <em>Ontunez-Tursios v. Ashcroft, </em>303 F.3d 341, 350 (5th Cir. 2002) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). Because the BIA adopted the findings and conclusions of the IJ in this case, we review the decision of the IJ. <em>Efe, </em>293 F.3d at 903.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-4\">Merchant has failed to make the requisite showing that she is unable or unwilling to return to India \u201cbecause of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.... \u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A); <em>see also Faddoul v.

R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
