Muhammad\u2019s counsel has filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), stating that, in her view, there are no meritorious grounds for appeal, but raising the issue of whether the court\u2019s sentence was plainly unreasonable. Muhammad was advised of his right to file a pro se supplemental brief but did not do so. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-27\">We review an order imposing a sentence after revocation of supervised release for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Davis, </em>53 F.3d 638, 642-43 (4th Cir.1995). Muhammad admitted the charged violations; thus, a preponderance of the evidence established that he committed the supervised release violations as alleged. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3583(e)(3) (West Supp. 2004). Counsel argues on appeal, however, that Muhammad\u2019s sentence of thirty-six <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"790\">*790</page-number>months\u2019 imprisonment is plainly unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-4\">Muhammad\u2019s conviction for bank fraud, a Class B felony, <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1344 (2000), exposed him to a maximum sentence of three years upon revocation of supervised release. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3583(e)(3). Accordingly, after revoking Muhammad\u2019s supervised release, the district court was statutorily authorized to impose an active prison term of up to three years.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-5\">Although in this case the guidelines indicated a sentencing range of twenty-one to twenty-seven months\u2019 imprisonment, as counsel concedes, the sentencing guideline range calculated under <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 7B1.4(a) (2003) is purely advisory. <em>United States v. Davis, </em>53 F.3d 638, 642 (4th Cir.1995); <em>United States v. Denard, </em>24 F.3d 599, 602 (4th Cir.1994). Because Muhammad\u2019s sentence does not exceed the statutory maximum under \u00a7 3583(e)(3), this court reviews the sentence only to determine whether it is \u201cplainly unreasonable.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(a)(4) (2000). Upon review of the record, we conclude that Muhammad\u2019s sentence of thirty-six months\u2019 imprisonment is not plainly unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-6\">In accordance with the requirements of <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record in this case and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. Accordingly, we affirm. This court requires that counsel inform her client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
