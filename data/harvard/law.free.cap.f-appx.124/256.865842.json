We review a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A dismissal as frivolous for an abuse of discretion. <em>See Martin v. Scott, </em>156 F.3d 578, 580 (5th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b288-25\">Newsome contends that he is not challenging the fact or duration of his confinement and that the district court erred in determining that his suit is barred by <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994). Contrary to Newsome\u2019s contentions, he is challenging his continued confinement. Because New-some brought his claims in a 42 U.S.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>\u00a7 1983 action and because success in this 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 action would necessarily imply the invalidity of his continued confinement, the claims are barred by <em>Heck, </em>and the district court did not abuse its discretion in dismissing the suit as frivolous. <em>See McGrew v. Texas Bd. of Pardons &amp; Paroles, </em>47 F.3d 158, 161 (5th Cir.1995). Newsome\u2019s argument that the district court erred in denying his motions for a default judgment is meritless. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">Accordingly, the judgment is AFFIRMED. The district court\u2019s dismissal of Newsome\u2019s complaint counts as a strike for purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 38788 (5th Cir.1996). Newsome is cautioned that once he accumulates three strikes, he may not proceed in forma pauperis in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b289-6\">AFFIRMED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b288-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
