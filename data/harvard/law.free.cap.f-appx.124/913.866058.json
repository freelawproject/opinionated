The issue on which a certificate of appealability was granted is \u201cwhether Cross\u2019s trial was rendered fundamentally unfair by the trial court\u2019s exclusion as inadmissible hearsay of Cross\u2019s proffered testimony concerning his conversations with Deputy Odem.\u201d <em>See Cross v. Dretke, </em>No. 04-20396 (5th Cir. Sept. 8, 2004) (unpublished).</p>\n<p id=\"b946-5\">We hold that the state court\u2019s determination that, even if error, the evidentiary ruling was harmless was neither contrary to clearly established federal law as determined by the Supreme Court nor based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state-court proceedings. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d); <em>Williams v. Taylor, </em>529 U.S. 362, 411-12, 120 S.Ct. 1495, 146 L.Ed.2d 389 (2000). Cross introduced evidence that he was induced to commit the offense, but, finding his testimony not credible, the jury rejected the entrapment defense. The record does not support a determination that Cross\u2019s proffered testimony, largely cumulative of his trial testimony, would have had \u201csubstantial and injurious effect or influence in determining the jury\u2019s verdict\u201d and was therefore harmless. <em>See Brecht v. Abrahamson, </em>507 U.S. 619, 631, 113 S.Ct. 1710, 123 L.Ed.2d 353 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b946-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b946-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
