She appeals her conviction alleging that the district court erred in: (1) finding her competent to stand trial and to be sentenced; and (2) instructing the jury on first and second degree murder.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b526-18\">We first address Charley\u2019s competency. The United States Supreme Court has held that a defendant is competent to stand trial if he \u201chas sufficient present ability to consult with his lawyer with a reasonable degree of rational understanding ... [and] a rational as well as factual understanding of the proceedings against him.\u201d <em>Cooper v. Oklahoma, </em>517 U.S. 348, 354, 116 S.Ct. 1373, 134 L.Ed.2d 498 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>(1996). Whether a defendant is capable of understanding the proceedings and assisting counsel depends on evidence of the defendant\u2019s irrational behavior, the defendant\u2019s demeanor in court, and medical opinions on the defendant\u2019s competence. <em>Miles v. Stainer, </em>108 F.3d 1109, 1112 (9th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">Here, the district court\u2019s competency determination was supported by evidence from the government\u2019s mental health expert. Neither of Charley\u2019s mental health experts, who noted her depression and mental problems, went so far as to opine that she was incompetent, and even if they had done so, \u201cwhere there are two permissible views of the evidence, the fact-finder\u2019s choice between them cannot be clearly erroneous.\u201d <em>United States v. Awad, </em>371 F.3d 583, 591 (9th Cir.2004). Also, the district court noted that Charley had \u201cnot been irrational in court or at any time before the Court, or given any indication whatsoever that she has some current mental state that would affect her ability to know where she is or what she\u2019s doing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b527-6\">Although Charley asserts on appeal that she made irrational trial decisions that allegedly show her incompetency, defendants are not rendered incompetent to stand trial just because they refuse to cooperate with counsel, <em>Guam v. Taitano, </em>849 F.2d 431, 432 (9th Cir.1988), or otherwise behave in ways that are unreasonable and detrimental to their cases, <em>Davis v. Woodford, </em>384 F.3d 628, 646-47 (9th Cir. 2004). Charley\u2019s decision-making relating to her defense does not give rise to the \u201cfirm conviction\u201d that the district court erred in finding her competent; to the contrary, there is expert evidence that Charley was competent to stand trial, and the district court made an independent determination that Charley \u201cha[d] sufficient ability to consult with counsel with a reasonable degree of rational understanding\u201d and could \u201cassist in preparing her defense\u201d based on its observations of her courtroom demeanor and her interactions with her attorneys. The district court did not clearly err in determining that Charley was competent to stand trial and to undergo sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-8\">We finally address the issue of the challenged jury instructions. Because defense counsel unequivocally withdrew objection to the district court\u2019s first and second degree murder instructions, our review is for plain error. <em>Davis, </em>36 F.3d at 1431. The district court used our Model Criminal Jury Instructions, and these instructions comported with the standards set forth in our precedents for first degree murder, <em>United States v. Free, </em>841 F.2d 321, 325 (9th Cir.1988), and second degree murder, <em>United States v. Houser, </em>130 F.3d 867, 871 &amp; n. 3 (9th Cir.1997). Under such circumstances the district court\u2019s error, if any existed, was not plain. <em>United States v. Paul, </em>37 F.3d 496, 500 (9th Cir.1994) (for an error to be plain it must be \u201c \u2018clear\u2019 or \u2018obvious\u2019 under current law\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b527-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b526-11\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b526-12\">. We address in a concurrently filed opinion Charley's other contentions, relating to her unsuccessful pretrial motions to suppress evidence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b526-13\">. We review a district court\u2019s determination that a defendant is competent to stand trial for clear error. <em>United States v. Friedman, </em>366 F.3d 975, 980 (9th Cir.2004). Clear error review is \"significantly deferential,\u201d and we \"must accept the district court\u2019s findings absent a definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u201d <em>Leavitt v. Arave, </em>383 F.3d 809, 815 (9th Cir.2004) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b526-20\">Where objections to jury instructions were withdrawn, we review only for plain error. <em>United States v. Davis, </em>36 F.3d 1424, 1431 (9th Cir.1994). Under this standard, a defendant must prove that \u201cthere was 'error,' the error was 'plain,' and the error affected 'substantial rights.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Pacheco-Zepeda, </em>234 F.3d 411, 413 (9th Cir.2000). If these criteria are met, we may exercise our discretion to correct the error only if the error \"seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of the judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
