Lopez appeals the district court\u2019s dismissal of his lawsuit for lack of jurisdiction. We AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-19\">Lopez represented Gala D. Mitchell in her dispute with her current employer, Houston Independent School District (HISD). The parties went through a mediation process and ultimately resolved their conflict. Mitchell received a new, higher paying position with HISD without ever resorting to litigation. Lopez requested attorneys\u2019 fees pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12205, arguing under the \u201ccatalyst theory\u201d that his litigation threats and assistance in the negotiations entitled him to fees. HISD rejected this claim. Lopez then filed suit himself in district court seeking attorneys\u2019 fees.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The district court adopted the magistrate judge\u2019s memorandum and recommendation, which held that Lopez, having failed to file any lawsuit or institute any administrative proceeding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>whatsoever under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) on behalf of his client, lacks any claim to attorneys\u2019 fees under that law.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-4\">Lopez appeals to this court. We affirm based on the district court\u2019s well-reasoned opinion (and the thorough memorandum and recommendation of the magistrate judge). Specifically, we agree that Lopez lacks standing to sue solely for attorneys\u2019 fees. The relevant provision of the ADA permits a \u201cprevailing party\u201d to secure attorneys\u2019 fees. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12205. Lopez is not a \u201cprevailing party\u201d in any litigation with HISD; his client, Mitchell, is not part of the instant suit. Lopez thus lacks the requisite \u201cpersonal injury\u201d to have standing in federal court. <em>See Allen v. Wright, </em>468 U.S. 737, 751, 104 S.Ct. 3315, 3324, 82 L.Ed.2d 556, (1984). Alternatively, under recent Supreme Court precedent, even if Lopez had standing, he cannot recover attorneys\u2019 fees under the statute in question through his conduct in this case, which never resulted in the filing of any lawsuit or administrative action. <em>See Buckhannon Bd. and Care Home, Inc. v. West Virginia Dept. of Health and Human Res., </em>532 U.S. 598, 605, 121 S.Ct. 1835, 1840, 149 L.Ed.2d 855 (2001) (\u201c[Supreme Court] precedents thus counsel against holding that the term \u2018prevailing party\u2019 authorizes an award of attorney\u2019s fees <em>without </em>a corresponding alteration in the legal relationship of the parties.\u201d (emphasis in original)); <em>see also North Carolina Dep\u2019t of Transp. v. Crest St. Community Council, </em>479 U.S. 6, 107 S.Ct. 336, 93 L.Ed.2d 188 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b268-5\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED. All costs shall be borne by Appellant.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b267-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b267-12\">. Mitchell was not a party in the district court. Lopez\u2019s effort to include her as a party on appeal is unavailing. <em>See Marino v. Ortiz, </em>484 U.S. 301, 304, 108 S.Ct. 586, 587, 98 L.Ed.2d 629 (1988) (\"The rule that only parties to a lawsuit, or those that properly become parties, may appeal an adverse judgment, is well settled.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
