Having reviewed the decision of the Board and the administrative record, we conclude that the Board did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion to reconsider and reopen. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(a) (2004) (providing the grant or denial of a motion to reopen or reconsider is within the Board\u2019s discretion); <em>INS v. Doherty, </em>502 U.S. 314, 323-24, 112 S.Ct. 719, 116 L.Ed.2d 823 (1992); <em>Stewart v. INS, </em>181 F.3d 587, 595, 596 (4th Cir.1999). Therefore, we deny the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-11\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
