We have reviewed the record and find no reversible error. Accordingly, we affirm on the reasoning of the district court. <em>See Hargrove v. Steiner, </em>No. CA-04-304-5-FL (E.D.N.C. Dec. 23, 2004). We further deny Hargrove\u2019s motion for a certificate of appealability pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2553(c) as unnecessary to this appeal. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-13\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
