After carefully reviewing the briefs and the record, we affirm the district court judgment for essentially the reasons stated in that court\u2019s order, dated April 20, 2004. We add only that, in relation to claimant\u2019s difficulties with maintaining concentration and attention, the administrative law judge presented this limitation to the vocational expert at the supplemental hearing, and the vocational expert responded that such difficulties would not preclude claimant from working at the unskilled level. Thus, the administrative law judge did not ignore claimant\u2019s limitations in this regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-8\"><em>Affirmed. See </em>Local Rule 27(c).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
