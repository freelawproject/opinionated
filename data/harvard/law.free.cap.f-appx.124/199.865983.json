Mbouende, a native and citizen of Cameroon, petitions for review of an order of the Board of Immigration Appeals (\u201cBoard\u201d) denying his motion to reopen immigration proceedings. We have reviewed the record and the Board\u2019s order and find that the Board did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion as untimely filed. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2) (2004); <em>INS v. Doherty, </em>502 U.S. 314, 323-24, 112 S.Ct. 719, 116 L.Ed.2d 823 (1992). We further find that we lack jurisdiction to review Mbouende\u2019s claim that the Board should have exercised its sua sponte power to reopen his proceedings. <em>Enriquez-Alvarado v. Ashcroft, </em>371 F.3d 246, 249-50 (5th Cir.2004); <em>Belay-Gebru v. INS, </em>327 F.3d 998, 1000-01 (10th Cir.2003); <em>Calle-Vujiles v. Ashcroft, </em>320 F.3d 472, 474-75 (3d Cir.2003); <em>Ekimian v. INS, </em>303 F.3d 1153, 1159 (9th Cir.2002); <em>Luis v. INS, </em>196 F.3d 36, 40-41 (1st Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b231-24\">Accordingly, we deny the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>fore the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-4\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
