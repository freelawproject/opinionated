Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 483-84, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992). We have reviewed the evidence of record and conclude that Tsobgny fails to show that the evidence compels a contrary result. Having failed to qualify for asylum, Tsobgny cannot meet the higher standard to qualify for withholding of removal. <em>Chen v. INS, </em>195 F.3d 198, 205 (4th Cir.1999); <em>INS v. Cardoza-Fonseca, </em>480 U.S. 421, 430, 107 S.Ct. 1207, 94 L.Ed.2d 434 (1987). Finally, we uphold the IJ\u2019s finding that Tsobgny failed to establish that it was more likely than not that he would be tortured if removed to Cameroon. See <em>8 </em>C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.16(c)(2) (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b846-20\">Accordingly, we deny the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-21\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
