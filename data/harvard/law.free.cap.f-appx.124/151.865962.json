Because the assets have been transferred in accordance with the bankruptcy court\u2019s order and Baron Financial has failed to obtain a stay pending appeal, we grant the motion to consolidate these appeals and dismiss the appeals as moot. <em>See </em>11 U.S.C. \u00a7 363(m) (1994); <em>Willemain v. Kivitz, </em>764 F.2d 1019, 1021-24 (4th Cir.1985) (holding that sale of property to secured creditor while appeal was pending rendered appeal moot); <em>see also In re Stadium Mgmt. Corp., </em>895 F.2d 845, 847 (1st Cir.1990) (\u201cabsent a stay, the court must dismiss a pending appeal as moot because the court has no remedy that it can fashion even if it would have determined the issues differently\u201d). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-6\">\n<em>DISMISSED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
