Nelson\u2019s complaint sought compensation for damage to his personal property.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-4\">The district court did not plainly err in dismissing Nelson\u2019s deprivation-of-property claim as frivolous. <em>Douglass v.

Collins, </em>26 F.3d 541, 543 (5th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b930-5\">Nelson\u2019s appeal is without arguable merit and is frivolous. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983). Because the appeal is frivolous, it is DISMISSED. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2. The dismissal of this appeal as frivolous and the district court\u2019s dismissal as frivolous each count as a \u201cstrike\u201d for purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387-88 (5th Cir.1996). Nelson received a previous strike as the result of the dismissal as frivolous of his appeal from the denial of Fed.R.CivP. 60(b) relief in a 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 complaint. <em>See Nelson v. Soliz, </em>77 F.3d 476 (5th Cir.1995). Therefore, Nelson has accumulated at least three \u201cstrikes\u201d under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g), and he is BARRED from bringing any civil action or appeal IFP while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he shows that he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-6\">APPEAL DISMISSED AS FRIVOLOUS; 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g) BAR IMPOSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b929-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
