He argues that the district court erred in construing his requests for injunctive and declaratory relief as unexhausted requests for habeas relief and, additionally, that the district court erred in dismissing his claims for monetary damages pursuant to <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994), without first affording him the opportunity to amend his complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-22\">Assuming arguendo that the district court erroneously construed Hill\u2019s claims as implicating the validity of his conviction and challenging the fact of his confinement, the court\u2019s ultimate dismissal of his complaint for failure to state a claim was not error. None of the acts of the defendants as alleged by Hill involved the violation of a constitutional right, and, therefore, he has failed to state a \u00a7 1983 claim. <em>See Orellana v. Kyle, </em>65 F.3d 29, 31 (5th Cir.1995). Hill\u2019s proposed amendment to his complaint fails to cure this deficiency. <em>See Kane Enters. v. MacGregor (USA), Inc., </em>322 F.3d 371, 374 (5th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b324-23\">We therefore affirm on alternative grounds the dismissal for failure to state a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>claim. <em>See Sojourner T v. Edwards, </em>974 F.2d 27, 30 (5th Cir.1992). The district court\u2019s dismissal counts as a strike for purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 388 (5th Cir.1996). Hill is CAUTIONED that if he accumulates three strikes under \u00a7 1915(g), he will not be able to proceed in forma pauperis in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">AFFIRMED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b324-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
