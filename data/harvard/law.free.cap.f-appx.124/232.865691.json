Nalls, Jr., argues on appeal that the district court abused its discretion by imposing on him an 18-month suspension from practicing law before the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Louisiana. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-17\">First, Nalls fails to provide a transcript of the show cause hearing. Therefore, we dismiss his appeal insofar as he argues (i) that the evidence was insufficient and (ii) that the judge who presided over the show cause hearing found that Nalls had not intentionally filed a frivolous lawsuit.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b265-18\">Furthermore, each of Nails\u2019s additional arguments also fails. Nalls\u2019s assertion that there is no legal authority to impose a suspension of the practice of law is without merit.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> As we have noted, \u201c[i]t is beyond dispute that a federal court may suspend or dismiss an attorney as an exercise of the court\u2019s inherent powers.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b266-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>Given the well-established power of a court to suspend attorneys from practicing before it, insofar as Nalls is challenging the Order to Show Cause as insufficient notice, his argument still fails. Although the OSC in this case did not specifically mention the possibility of a suspension, nor did it specify any particular Rule of Professional Conduct that was breached, it did give reasonable notice.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The OSC reads: \u201cIT IS ORDERED that Mr. Clarence T. Nalls ... show cause ... why sanctions should not be imposed against him personally, under Fed. Rule Civ. P. 11, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1927, and the inherent powers of the court... ,\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> It goes on to detail the objectionable behavior potentially giving rise to sanctions.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b266-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b265-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
