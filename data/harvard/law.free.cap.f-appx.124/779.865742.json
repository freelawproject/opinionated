She was sentenced to 41 months imprisonment. On appeal, she challenges the sufficiency of the evidence to support the jury\u2019s verdict and argues that the district court erred in denying her a reduc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"780\">*780</page-number>tion under <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 3B1.2 (2003) for being a minor participant in the robbery. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-4\">To determine if there was sufficient evidence to support a conviction, this court considers whether, taking the evidence in the light most favorable to the Government, substantial evidence supports the jury\u2019s verdict. <em>Glasser v. United States, </em>315 U.S. 60, 80, 62 S.Ct. 457, 86 L.Ed. 680 (1942). Substantial evidence is defined as \u201cthat evidence which \u2018a reasonable finder of fact could accept as adequate and sufficient to support a conclusion of a defendant\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Newsome, </em>322 F.3d 328, 333 (4th Cir.2003) (quoting <em>United States v. Burgos, </em>94 F.3d 849, 862 (4th Cir.1996) (en banc)). The court reviews both direct and circumstantial evidence and permits the Government the benefit of all reasonable inferences from the facts proven to those sought to be established. <em>United States v. Tresvant, </em>677 F.2d 1018, 1021 (4th Cir.1982). Witness credibility is within the sole province of the jury, and the court will not reassess the credibility of testimony. <em>United States v. Saunders, </em>886 F.2d 56, 60 (4th Cir.1989). We have reviewed the evidence presented at trial and find that the jury\u2019s verdict is sufficiently supported by the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-5\">Turner also argues that the district court erred in denying her motion for a downward adjustment under <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 3B1.2 (2003) for her mitigating role in the offense. A defendant has the burden of showing by a preponderance of the evidence that she had a mitigating role in the offense. <em>United States v. Akinkoye, </em>185 F.3d 192, 202 (4th Cir.1999). A two-level reduction may be made when a defendant is a minor participant, that is, one who \u201cis less culpable than most other participants, but whose role could not be described as minimal.\u201d USSG \u00a7 3B1.2(b), comment, (n.5). The \u201ccritical inquiry is thus not just whether the defendant has done fewer \u2018bad acts\u2019 than [her] co-defendants, but whether the defendant\u2019s conduct is material or essential to committing the offense.\u201d <em>United States v. Pratt, </em>239 F.3d 640, 646 (4th Cir.2001) (internal quotation omitted). Role adjustments are determined on the basis of the defendant\u2019s relevant conduct. <em>United States v. Fells, </em>920 F.2d 1179, 1183-84 (4th Cir.1990). The district court\u2019s determination concerning the defendant\u2019s role in the offense is a factual issue reviewed for clear error. <em>United States v. Perkins, </em>108 F.3d 512, 518 (4th Cir.1997). We find no clear error in the district court\u2019s refusal to give the reduction at sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-7\">Accordingly, we affirm Turner\u2019s conviction and sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-8\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
