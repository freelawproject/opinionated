Previously, the district court had treated Cureaux\u2019s \u201cPetition for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\u2019 as a second or successive 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion to vacate his conviction and sentence, and it had transferred the case to this court to permit Cureaux to seek authorization to file it in the district court. <em>See In re Epps, </em>127 F.3d 364, 365 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b859-11\">Cureaux argues that the district court had no legal authority to \u201ctransmogrify\u201d his \u201cPetition for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief \u2019 into a <em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 </em>motion. Cureaux does not explicitly challenge the district court\u2019s treatment of his postjudgment \u201cMotion to Take Judicial Notice\u201d as a Rule 60(b) motion or its denial of that motion. A Rule 60(b) motion is not a substitute for appeal of the underlying judgment, <em>see Travelers Ins. Co. v. Liljeberg Enter., Inc., </em>38 F.3d 1404, 1408 (5th Cir.1994), and must be based on one of six grounds cited in the rule, such as mistake, newly discovered evidence, or fraud. <em>See </em>Rule 60(b). Cureaux\u2019s failure to identify an error in the district\u2019s court analysis of his postjudgment motion is the same as if he had not appealed the judgment. <em>See Brinkmann v. Dallas County Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir.1987). In any event, nothing in Cureaux\u2019s appellate brief or our review of the record reflects that the district court erred in construing Cureaux\u2019s postjudgment motion as a Rule 60(b) motion or that it abused its discretion in denying such motion. <em>See Travelers Ins. Co., </em>38 F.3d at 1408. The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-16\">Cureaux is hereby WARNED that any further repetitious or frivolous attempts to circumvent statutory restrictions on filing second or successive 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motions to vacate may result in the imposition of sanctions against him. These sanctions may include dismissal, monetary sanctions, and restrictions on his ability to file pleadings in this court and any court subject to this court\u2019s jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-17\">AFFIRMED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b859-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
