We will affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-11\">I. Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b740-12\">As we write only for the parties, we include only such factual and procedural events as are necessary to our decision. On April 12, 1999, Appellant Kaclik began her employment with Appellee Society for Protective Coatings (\u201cSSPC\u201d) as a marketing specialist in sponsorship development. On October 4, 1999, Kaclik claims she was exposed to hazardous chemicals from painting being done in the building housing SSPC\u2019s offices. She immediately visited a doctor, who diagnosed her respiratory condition as \u201casthma secondary to fumes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b740-13\">From November 15,1999, through January 3, 2000, Appellant was unable to work because of this respiratory condition. On December 13, 1999, Terry Sowers, SSPC\u2019s Director of Marketing wrote to Kaclik, advising her that if she did not return to work full-time, her employment would be terminated. Kaclik returned to work part-time in early January. On January 27, 2000, Sowers again wrote to Kaclik, informing her that if she did not return to work full-time her employment would be terminated. Sowers also informed Kaclik that her performance evaluations would be postponed and that she could face immediate termination if she were absent again during the 3-month period following her return to work.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-17\">On March 1, 2000, Kaclik returned to work full-time, but on March 3 she became ill from the fumes from cleaning products in the building. She was again made ill at work on March 15, 2000 and March 16, 2000 by welding smoke in the building. SSPC\u2019s Executive Director, William Shoup, publicly ridiculed Kaclik, claiming that all she smelled was overcooked food in the office microwave. Kaclik left work early on March 16 and did not report to work on March 17. Kaclik\u2019s employment was terminated on March 20, 2000. Kaclik then applied for unemployment benefits, which she received until July 2000. In August 2000, she re-filed a workers compensation claim based on the injury that occurred on October 4, 1999; however, Kaclik experienced repeated instances of delay due to SSPC\u2019s provision of incorrect information to the Worker\u2019s Compensation Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-18\">Kaclik filed a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (\u201cEEOC\u201d) on November 6, 2001. On January 28, 2002, the EEOC dismissed her charge of discrimination because she had failed to state a claim under any of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>statutes enforced by the EEOC and because her charge was not timely filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-5\">On March 20, 2002, Kaclik, acting <em>pro se, </em>filed a complaint in the District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania. Kaclik alleged violations of the Fair Labor Standards Act (\u201cFLSA\u201d), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 201, <em>et seq., </em>the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12101 <em>et seq., </em>the Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 401 <em>et seq., </em>The Occupational Safety and Health Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 654, the Norris-LaGuardia Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 106 and Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e, <em>et seq. </em>Kaclik also alleged violations of Pennsylvania state law. SSPC filed a Motion to Dismiss pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. This Motion was granted by the District Court and Kaclik now appeals the dismissal of her claims pursuant to the ADA and the FLSA and her related state tort actions for wrongful discharge and personal injury. Kaclik also appeals the District Court\u2019s denial of her request to amend her complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-6\">II. Jurisdiction and Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b741-7\">The District Court had federal question jurisdiction over this case under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331, based upon Kaclik\u2019s claims pursuant to the various federal statutes listed above. The District Court had supplemental jurisdiction over her state claims pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1367. We exercise jurisdiction over the District Court\u2019s final order pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. Our review over the District Court\u2019s grant of a Motion to Dismiss for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted is plenary. <em>Emerson v. Thiel College, </em>296 F.3d 184, 188 (3d Cir.2002). We review the District Court\u2019s refusal to grant leave to amend a complaint due to futility for abuse of discretion. <em>In re Adams Golf, Inc. Secs. Litig., </em>381 F.3d 267, 281 (3d Cir .2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b741-9\">III. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b741-10\">The District Court dismissed Kaclik\u2019s claims of disability discrimination and retaliation in violation of the ADA because she had not exhausted her administrative remedies, as is required to bring suit under the ADA. Under the provisions of the ADA, in a \u201cdeferral\u201d state such as Pennsylvania, an employee must file a charge of discrimination with the EEOC within 300 days of the occurrence of the alleged unlawful practice. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 626(d)(2); <em>see Bailey v. United Airlines, </em>279 F.3d 194, 197 (3d Cir.2002). Kaclik failed to do so and thus she was time-barred from bringing this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-11\">The District Court also found that Kaclik could not state a legally cognizable claim for retaliation under the FLSA because she had not alleged that she was involved in any FLSA proceeding or engaged in any other activity protected by the FLSA. Kaclik had only alleged that she was being retaliated against for her complaints about potential unethical business practices within SSPC and the fumes to which she had been exposed. The District Court was correct to find that neither of these allegations involved \u201cprotected activities\u201d under the FLSA.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-12\">Finally, the District Court denied Kaclik leave to amend her Complaint to add additional allegations under the ADA, Title VII or OSHA because the ADA and Title VII actions were barred by her failure to exhaust her administrative remedies and she lacked standing to bring an OSHA claim. The District Court did not abuse its discretion in so deciding. Furthermore, during the pendency of this appeal, we requested additional information from Kaclik about <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>the precise nature of her proposed amendments. In response to our request, Kaclik focused exclusively on a potential claim under the FLSA. While we recognize that Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 15 calls for the granting of leave to amend a Complaint \u201cwhen justice so requires,\u201d we find that Kaclik\u2019s failure to assert a proposed amendment of her Complaint to encompass an FLSA claim before the District Court, combined with the extremely tenuous nature of her proposed amendment, compels the conclusion that the District Court did not abuse its discretion in denying her leave to amend her Complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-4\">In light of the foregoing, we will AFFIRM the order of the District Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
