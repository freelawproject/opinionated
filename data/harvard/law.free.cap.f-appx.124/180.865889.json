This court \u201cmay review a final order of removal only if ... the alien has exhausted all administrative remedies available to the alien as of right.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d) (2000). In this case, Natalia\u2019s briefs were twice rejected by the Board on procedural grounds, and she failed to move for consideration of an untimely brief. The Board therefore affirmed the immigration judge\u2019s decision without opinion, with no claims presented by Natalia for its consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-13\">Where Congress has statutorily mandated exhaustion, that requirement must be enforced. <em>Kurfees v. INS, 275 F.3d 332, </em>336 (4th Cir.2001) (applying former 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1105a(c)); <em>see Theodoropoulos v. INS, </em>358 F.3d 162, 171 (2d Cir.) (applying 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 37, 160 L.Ed.2d 34 (2004); <em>Barron v. Ashcroft, </em>358 F.3d 674, 677 (9th Cir.2004) (same). An alien is required to exhaust administrative remedies as to each claim in order to preserve judicial review. <em>Abdulrahman v. Ashcroft, </em>330 F.3d 587, 594 (3d Cir.2003). We have held that \u201can alien who has failed to raise claims during an appeal to the [Board] has waived his right to raise those claims before a federal court on appeal of the [Board] decision,\u201d <em>Farrokhi v. INS, </em>900 F.2d 697, 700 (4th Cir.1990) (interpreting former 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1105a(c)), and that the court lacks jurisdiction to consider an argument not made to the Board. <em>Asika v. Ashcroft, </em>362 F.3d 264, 267 n. 3 (4th Cir.2004), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 861, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b213-18\">Therefore, as Natalia raised no claims before the Board, we lack jurisdiction to consider any of the claims she seeks to raise here. We therefore deny the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-19\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
