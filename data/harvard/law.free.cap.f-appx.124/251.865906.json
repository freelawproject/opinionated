Praylor argues that prison officials exercised excessive force, violated his right to equal protection, and caused him mental anguish as a result of an altercation during a housing transfer.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-4\">Because Praylor\u2019s claims against Smith and Shuck stem strictly from their supervisory roles and because he has not shown that they implemented a policy that resulted in a constitutional violation, Praylor has not raised a cognizable constitutional claim as to these defendants. <em>See Thompkins v. Belt, </em>828 F.2d 298, 303-04 (5th Cir.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">Praylor has not stated an Eighth Amendment claim because his injuries were de minimis and because he has not shown that the force deployed in light of his resistance to being subdued was \u201crepugnant to the conscience of mankind.\u201d <em>See Baldwin v. Stalder, </em>137 F.3d 836, 838-39 (5th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b284-6\">Praylor\u2019s claim that the prison fails to follow its policies regarding life endangerment requests does not amount to a constitutional violation. <em>See Edwards v. Johnson, </em>209 F.3d 772, 779 (5th Cir.2000). Praylor\u2019s assertion that \u201cother inmates\u201d were granted such requests is conelusional and thus does not state an equal protection violation. <em>See Koch v. Puckett, </em>907 F.2d 524, 530 (5th Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b284-7\">Likewise, Praylor\u2019s claim for mental anguish fails to state a cognizable constitutional claim. Because his injuries were de minimis, his claim is not actionable under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. <em>See Siglar v. Hightower, </em>112 F.3d 191, 193 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b284-8\">Praylor\u2019s appeal is without arguable merit and is thus frivolous. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983). As such, it is DISMISSED. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2. The magistrate judge\u2019s dismissal of Praylor\u2019s claims pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B) and the dismissal of the instant appeal as frivolous count as two strikes under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 385-87 (5th Cir.1996). Praylor is cautioned that once he accumulates three strikes, he will not be permitted to proceed in forma pauperis in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b284-11\">APPEAL DISMISSED AS FRIVOLOUS; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b283-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cm.
