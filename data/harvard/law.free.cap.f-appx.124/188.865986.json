Simanjantak, and their daughter, Heidy J.R. Simanjantak (collectively \u201cPetitioners\u201d), natives and citizens of Indonesia, petition for review of an order of the Board of Immigration Appeals dismissing their appeal from the immigration judge\u2019s denial of their requests for asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the Convention Against Torture. Siahaan is the primary applicant for asylum; the claims of her husband and daughter are derivative of her application. See 8 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1158(b)(3) (West 1999 &amp; Supp. 2004); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.21(a) (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">In their petition for review, the Petitioners challenge the Board\u2019s determination that they failed to establish their eligibility for asylum. To obtain reversal of a determination denying eligibility for relief, an alien \u201cmust show that the evidence he presented was so compelling that no reasonable factfinder could fail to find the requisite fear of persecution.\u201d <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 483-84, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992). We have reviewed the evidence of record and conclude that the Petitioners fail to show that the evidence compels a contrary result. Accordingly, we cannot grant the relief that they seek.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">Additionally, we uphold the denial of the Petitioners\u2019 request for withholding of removal. \u201cBecause the burden of proof for withholding of removal is higher than for asylum \u2014 even though the facts that must be proved are the same \u2014 an applicant who is ineligible for asylum is necessarily ineligible for withholding of removal under [8 U.S.C.] \u00a7 1231(b)(3).\u201d <em>Camara v. Ashcroft, </em>378 F.3d 361, 367 (4th Cir.2004). Because the Petitioners fail to show that they are eligible for asylum, they cannot meet the higher standard for withholding of removal.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b221-7\">Accordingly, we deny the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-8\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b221-10\"> The Petitioners do not challenge the denial of their request for protection under the Convention Against Torture.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
