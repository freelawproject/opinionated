Ashcroft, </em>350 F.3d 845, 853 (9th Cir.2003), but we do not have jurisdiction to review whether an alien has satisfied the hardship requirement, which rests in the discretion of the agency. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)(i); <em>Romero-Torres v. Ashcroft, </em>327 F.3d 887, 891 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b601-22\">Because the BIA affirmed without opinion, we have no way of knowing on which ground or grounds the BIA affirmed, and in turn whether we have jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s decision. <em>See Lanza v. Ashcroft, </em>389 F.3d 917, 919 (9th Cir.2004). Accordingly, we vacate the BIA\u2019s decision and remand with instructions to clarify the grounds for its affirmance of the IJ\u2019s denial of the application for cancellation of removal. <em>Id. </em>at 932.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-23\">Alaniz contends for the first time on appeal that she was deprived of counsel in violation of her statutory right to representation and her due process rights. Because Alaniz never raised this issue before the BIA, she has failed to exhaust her administrative remedies and we do not have jurisdiction to consider it here. <em>See Barron v. Ashcroft, </em>358 F.3d 674, 678 (9th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b601-24\">VACATED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b601-26\"> xhiS disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
