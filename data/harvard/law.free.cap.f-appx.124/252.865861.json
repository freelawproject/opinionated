Miller, Texas prisoner # 1174744, appeals the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment and dismissal of his 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 claims against Williamson County Sheriff John Maspero. As he does not challenge the dismissal of his claims against the remaining defendants, those claims have been abandoned. <em>See Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 225 (5th Cir.1993). Moreover, we do not have jurisdiction to review the magistrate judge\u2019s denial of Miller\u2019s motion for appointment of counsel. <em>See Colburn v. Bunge Towing, Inc., </em>883 F.2d 372, 379 (5th Cir.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b285-18\">Miller\u2019s civil rights suit alleged that he was denied medical treatment during his pre-trial confinement at the Williamson County prison. Miller does not address the district court\u2019s reasons for granting summary judgment in favor of Sheriff Maspero in his individual and official capacities. Failure to identify an error in the district court\u2019s analysis is the same as if the appellant had not appealed the judgment. <em>See Brinkmann v. Dallas County Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir.1987). Because Miller has failed to contest the district court\u2019s reasons for granting Maspero\u2019s summary judgment motion, he has waived appellate review of those issues. <em>See Yohey v. Col</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number><em>lins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 225 (5th Cir.1993). Moreover, Miller has failed to show that there was another appropriate party for him to sue such that the district court\u2019s dismissal of his complaint without allowing him leave to amend to name another defendant was an abuse of discretion. <em>See Dayse v. Schuldt, </em>894 F.2d 170, 174 (5th Cir.1990); <em>Parker v. Fort Worth Police Dep't, </em>980 F.2d 1023, 1025-27 (5th Cir. 1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b286-4\">Miller\u2019s appeal lacks arguable merit and is DISMISSED AS FRIVOLOUS. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2; <em>Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983). The dismissal of Miller\u2019s appeal as frivolous counts as one strike under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 385-87 (5th Cir.1996). We warn Miller that once he accumulates three strikes, he may not proceed in forma pauperis in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b286-5\">APPEAL DISMISSED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b285-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
