Anderson was sentenced to ninety-six months\u2019 imprisonment to be followed by three years of supervised release. The district court also specified an identical alternative sentence of ninety-six months followed by three years supervised release, pursuant to this court\u2019s recommendation in <em>United States v. Hammond, </em>378 F.3d 426 (4th Cir.2004) (order), <em>opinion issued by </em>381 F.3d 316, 353-54 (4th Cir.2004) (en banc), <em>cert. granted and judgment vacated, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 125 S.Ct. 1051, 160 L.Ed.2d 997 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b244-13\">Anderson appealed, challenging the constitutionality of the federal sentencing scheme in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004). The case was held in abeyance pending decision in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). That opinion has now issued and applies the Court\u2019s reasoning in <em>Blakely </em>to the federal sentencing guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-18\">We conclude that because the alternative sentence the district court pronounced in case the federal sentencing guidelines were invalidated was identical to the mandatory sentence imposed under the federal sentencing guidelines as they existed at that time, any error resulting from the sentence imposed by the district court was harmless. Accordingly, we affirm Anderson\u2019s sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-19\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
