Mandamus relief is available only when the petitioner has a clear right to the relief sought. <em>See In re First Fed. Sav. &amp; Loan Assn., </em>860 F.2d 135, 138 (4th Cir.1988). Further, mandamus is a drastic remedy and should be used only in extraordinary circumstances. <em>See Kerr v. United States Dist. Court, </em>426 U.S. 394, 402, 96 S.Ct. 2119, 48 L.Ed.2d 725 (1976); <em>In re Beard, </em>811 F.2d 818, 826 (4th Cir.1987). Mandamus may not be used as a substitute for appeal. <em>See In re United Steelworkers, </em>595 F.2d 958, 960 (4th Cir.1979). The relief sought by Kokoski is not available by way of mandamus. Accordingly, although we grant leave to proceed in forma pauperis, we deny the petition for writ of mandamus.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-7\">In appeal No. 04-7788, Kokoski asserts that the Government committed fraud on the court by excluding the true object of their search from search warrant applications, and thus seeks an order declaring the district court\u2019s criminal judgment void ab initio. However, such a claim must be filed in the district court, and is thus not properly before this court. Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b)(3). Accordingly, we dismiss this appeal. We also deny all other outstanding motions. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-9\">No. 04-7788 <em>DISMISSED</em></p>\n<p id=\"AoY\">No. 04-7837 <em>PETITION DENIED</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
