The Robinsons assert that the district court erred by granting summary judgment on their claims under the Administrative Procedure Act (\u201cAPA\u201d), 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706, insisting that the final agency rulings are arbitrary and capricious, violate the Equal Protection and Due Process provisions of the Constitution, constitute gender discrimination under both the disparate treatment and disparate impact standards, and constitute retaliation for filing discrimination complaints against the FSA. The Robinsons additionally contend that the district court erred by granting summary judgment on their claims under the Equal Credit Opportunity Act (\u201cECOA\u201d), 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1691.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-10\">\u201cUnder the APA, the administrative record is reviewed to determine whether the challenged action was arbitrary and capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law....\u201d <em>State of Louisiana ex rel. Guste v. Verity, </em>853 F.2d 322, 326 (5th Cir.1988); <em>see </em>5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2)(A). The administrative record is also reviewed to determine whether the challenged action was \u201ccontrary to constitutional right, power, privilege, or immunity.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2)(B). We will not substitute our judgment for that of the agency, and we defer to the agency\u2019s interpretation of its governing legislation. <em>Weisbrod v. Sullivan, </em>875 F.2d 526, 527 (5th Cir.1989). As a formal hearing was held on this matter, we review the agency\u2019s factual findings only for substantial evidence. <em>See </em>5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2)(E); <em>Gore, Inc. v. Espy, </em>87 F.3d 767, 773 &amp; n. 42 (5th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b927-15\">The administrative record shows that the FSA followed the proper regulations and considered the relevant facts in making its decision. <em>See </em>7 C.F.R. \u00a7 1951.911(b)(1) (2004); 7 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 1951.911(a)(7)(ii), 1922.201 (1997). The Robinsons have not shown that this decision was arbitrary and capricious. <em>See Verity, </em>853 F.2d at 327.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-18\">Neither have the Robinsons shown that they were treated differently than others who were similarly situated. Two of the three persons whom they contend were similarly situated had their property valuations conducted when the applicable regulations concerning appraisals were markedly different, and the appraiser did not find that there was merchantable timber on the third person\u2019s property, as he found present on the Robinsons\u2019 property. <em>Compare </em>7 C.F.R. \u00a7 1809.1(c) (1992) <em>with </em>7 C.F.R. \u00a7 1922.201 (1997). Therefore, the denial of the Robinsons\u2019 equal protection claim is supported by substantial evidence and not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"896\">*896</page-number>otherwise erroneous. <em>See Village of Willowbrook v. Olech, </em>528 U.S. 562, 564, 120 S.Ct. 1073, 145 L.Ed.2d 1060 (2000). As there is no evidence that the FSA\u2019s actions shock the conscience or interfere with fundamental rights, the Robinsons\u2019 substantive due process claim is also without merit. <em>See United States v. Salerno, </em>481 U.S. 739, 746, 107 S.Ct. 2095, 95 L.Ed.2d 697 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b928-4\">As the FSA\u2019s determination that the Robinsons were not treated differently than similarly situated persons is supported by substantial evidence, the Robin-sons have not established a prima facie case of gender discrimination under the disparate treatment standard. <em>See McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, </em>411 U.S. 792, 802-03, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973). As the Robinsons did not identify any facially neutral practice of the FSA that allegedly had a disproportionate impact on women, the FSA and district court did not err by not considering the Robinsons\u2019 disparate impact claim. <em>See Anderson v. Douglas &amp; Lomason Co., </em>26 F.3d 1277, 1284 (5th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b928-5\">The administrative record shows that the Robinsons filed their discrimination complaint against the FSA after the FSA made the valuation that they are challenging. Although there are record references to a previous discrimination complaint that was filed by a member of the Robinson family, there is no evidence that the cognizant decisionmakers had knowledge of that complaint. Furthermore, there is no evidence establishing a causal link between the FSA\u2019s actions and any discrimination complaint. Accordingly, the FSA\u2019s denial of the Robinsons\u2019 retaliation claim is supported by substantial evidence and not otherwise erroneous. <em>See Ackel v. Nat\u2019l Communications, Inc., </em>339 F.3d 376, 385 (5th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b928-6\">Although (1) the lease/buyback program was an FSA Preservation Loan Servicing Program, (2) some FSA documents referred to the Robinsons as borrowers, and (3) the leases between the FSA and the Robinsons mentioned the possibility that the FSA might finance their purchase of the property, there is no evidence that the Robinsons ever sought or received credit from the FSA. Accordingly, the Robinsons\u2019 dealings with the FSA did not involve a credit transaction and the ECOA was inapplicable. <em>See </em>15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1691(a), 1691a(d); 12 C.F.R. \u00a7 202.2(m); <em>see also Shaumyan v. Sidetex Co., </em>900 F.2d 16, 18-19 (2d Cir.1990). The Robinsons\u2019 contention that the district court found that the ECOA was applicable, and that the defendants did not cross-appeal that ruling, is without merit. The district court granted summary judgment to the defendants on the merits of the Robinsons\u2019 ECOA claims without reaching the question whether the ECOA was applicable. We may affirm the district court\u2019s judgment \u201con any grounds supported by the record.\u201d <em>United States v. McSween, </em>53 F.3d 684, 687 n. 3 (5th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b928-8\">The Robinsons have not shown the existence of a genuine issue of material fact regarding either their APA or their ECOA claims. <em>See Little v. Liquid Air Corp., </em>37 F.3d 1069, 1075 (5th Cir.1994) (en banc). Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b927-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
