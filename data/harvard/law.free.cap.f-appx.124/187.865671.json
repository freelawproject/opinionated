The order is not appealable unless a circuit justice or judge issues a certificate of appealability. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1) (2000). A certificate of appealability will not issue absent \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2) (2000). A prisoner satisfies this standard by demonstrating that reasonable jurists would find that his constitutional claims are debatable and that any dispositive procedural rulings by the district court are also debatable or wrong. <em>See Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 336-38, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003); <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000); <em>Rose v. Lee, </em>252 F.3d 676, 683 (4th Cir.2001). We have independently reviewed the record and conclude that Green has not made the requisite <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>showing. Accordingly, we deny Green\u2019s motions to amend, for default judgment, for writ of mandamus, for general relief, and for entry of Fed.R.Civ.P. 54(b) judgment, and we deny a certificate of appealability and dismiss the appeal. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately , . . , , . , , \u201e ,, <em>J </em>presented m the materials before the court <em>r </em>, .. ., , . and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-10\">\n<em>DISMISSED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
