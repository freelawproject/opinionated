Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 483-84, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992). We have reviewed the evidence of record and conclude that Weng fails to show that the evidence compels a contrary result. Having failed to qualify for asylum, Weng cannot meet the higher standard to qualify for withholding of removal. <em>Chen v. INS, </em>195 F.3d 198, 205 (4th Cir.1999); <em>INS v. Cardoza-Fonseca, </em>480 U.S. 421, 430, 107 S.Ct. 1207, 94 L.Ed.2d 434 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b819-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"787\">*787</page-number>We also uphold the IJ\u2019s finding that Weng failed to establish eligibility for protection under the Convention Against Torture. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.16(c)(2) (2004). Finally, we reject Weng\u2019s claim that he was not accorded due process in that he was not provided sufficient opportunity to explain his inconsistent asylum applications, as this claim is belied by the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-5\">Accordingly, we deny the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-6\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
