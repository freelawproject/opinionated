Yefonge, a native and citizen of Cameroon, petitions for review of an order of the Board of Immigration Appeals (\u201cBoard\u201d) denying her motion to reopen or reconsider its previous decision affirming the immigration judge\u2019s denial of her applications for asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the Convention Against Torture. We have reviewed the record and the Board\u2019s order and find no abuse of discretion. Accordingly, as to the claims over which we retain jurisdiction,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> we deny the petition for review for the reasons stated by the Board. <em>See In re: Vefonge, </em>No. A77-892-899 (B.I.A. July 28, 2004). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-10\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b817-12\"> On December 9, 2004, we granted the Attorney General's motion for partial dismissal of the petition for review on the ground that we lack jurisdiction to review the Board\u2019s finding that Vefonge\u2019s asylum application was untimely filed and to review the denial of her request for voluntary departure.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
