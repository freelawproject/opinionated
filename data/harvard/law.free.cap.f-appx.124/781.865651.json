Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-8\">Whitley argues that the district court erred in denying his motion to suppress. This court reviews the factual findings underlying a motion to suppress for clear error, and the district court\u2019s legal determinations de novo. <em>See Ornelas v. United States, </em>517 U.S. 690, 699, 116 S.Ct. 1657, 134 L.Ed.2d 911 (1996). When a suppression motion has been denied, this court reviews the evidence in the light most favorable to the Government. <em>See United States v. Seidman, </em>156 F.3d 542, 547 (4th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b814-9\">With these standards in mind, and having reviewed the record and the parties\u2019 briefs, we conclude that the officer who seized Whitley did so based on a reasonable articulable suspicion that Whitley was engaged in criminal activity. \u201c[A]n officer may, consistent with the Fourth Amendment, conduct a brief, investigatory stop when the officer has a reasonable, articulable suspicion that criminal activity is afoot.\u201d <em>Illinois v. Wardlow, </em>528 U.S. 119, 123, 120 S.Ct. 673, 145 L.Ed.2d 570 (2000); <em>Terry v. Ohio, </em>392 U.S. 1, 30, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 20 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968). We conclude that, given the totality of the circumstances, <em>see United States v. Sokolow, </em>490 U.S. 1, 8, 109 S.Ct. 1581, 104 L.Ed.2d 1 (1989), Whitley\u2019s suspicious and evasive behavior justified the officer\u2019s actions. <em>See United States v. Mayo, </em>361 F.3d 802, 807-08 (4th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b814-15\">Accordingly, we affirm Whitley\u2019s conviction and sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-16\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b814-10\"> Because Whitley had at least three prior qualifying convictions, his 180-month sentence was the statutory mandatory minimum. <em>See 18 </em>U.S.C.A. \u00a7 924(e)(1) (West 2000 &amp; Supp. 2004). Moreover, Whitley does not seek to challenge his sentence. Thus, <em>United States v. Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014 , 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), does not impact this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
