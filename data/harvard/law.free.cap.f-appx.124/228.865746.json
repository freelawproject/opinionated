Appellants\u2019 motion to reconsider was also denied. The district court did not explicitly address Appellants\u2019 qualified immunity claim in its denial of their summary judgment motion, and they did not re-assert qualified immunity in their motion to reconsider.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-17\">Appellants\u2019 notice of appeal designated only the 20 May 2004 denial of their motion to reconsider. When an appellant \u201cnotices the appeal of a specified judgment only or a part thereof, ... this court has no jurisdiction to review other judgments or issues which are not expressly referred to and which are not impliedly intended for appeal\u201d. <em>Warfield v. Fidelity and Deposit Co., </em>904 F.2d 322, 325 (5th Cir.1990). Appellants\u2019 notice of appeal also identified their intention to appeal the underlying denial of the qualified immunity-based summary judgment. Therefore, Appellants are not precluded from appealing the denial of summary judgment. <em>See Trust Co. Bank v. United States Gypsum Co., </em>950 F.2d 1144, 1147-48 (5th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b262-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>The denial of summary judgment based on qualified immunity is immediately appealable only when based on an issue of law. <em>E.g., Rodriguez v. Neeley, </em>169 F.3d 220, 222 (5th Cir.1999). Orders determining \u201conly a question of \u2018evidence sufficiency\u201d are not based on an issue of law and are not immediately appealable. <em>Johnson v. Jones, </em>515 U.S. 304, 313, 115 S.Ct. 2151, 132 L.Ed.2d 238 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b262-4\">The district court held disputed material issues of fact precluded summary judgment on Vincent\u2019s retaliation and failure to protect claims. Because the district court based its denial of summary judgment on issues of fact, rather than of law, we lack jurisdiction to review the district court\u2019s implied rejection of the qualified immunity defense. <em>See Johnson, </em>515 U.S. at 319-20. Appellants\u2019 contentions center on evidence sufficiency issues and contend generally that Vincent has not shown a genuine issue of fact for trial. On interlocutory appeal of a qualified immunity defense, we cannot review \u201cwhether the nonmovant presented sufficient summary judgment evidence to create a dispute of fact\u201d, or the district court\u2019s assessment of what facts are established by, or inferable from, the record. <em>Nerren v. Livingston Police Dep\u2019t, </em>86 F.3d 469, 472 (5th Cir. 1996). <em>See also Palmer v. Johnson, </em>193 F.3d 346, 351 (5th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b262-5\">\n<em>APPEAL DISMISSED; ALL OUTSTANDING MOTIONS DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b261-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
