Caraballo argues that the district court failed to address his claim under the Administrative Procedures Act (APA) and that the dismissal of his APA claim was error because the APA provides for a private cause of action to challenge an agency\u2019s administrative procedures where no monetary damages are sought.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-12\">Caraballo\u2019s APA claim consisted only of his contention that BOP\u2019s Program Statement 1315.07 violates the APA because \u201cit fails to ensure meaningful access to the courts to non-English speaking inmates.\u201d The district court correctly found that Caraballo had not established that he was denied meaningful access to the courts. Thus, Caraballo has not shown that the district court erred in dismissing his APA claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-17\">Caraballo also argues that the dismissal of his action to compel the BOP to provide non-English speaking inmates with meaningful access to the courts was error because the BOP has failed to meet the \u201c \u2018meaningful access requirements\u2019 \u201d set forth by the Court in <em>Lewis v. Casey, </em>518 U.S. 343, 116 S.Ct. 2174, 135 L.Ed.2d 606 (1996). Although he states that he incorporates his objections to the magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation in support of this argument, we do not consider them. <em>See Peel &amp; Co., Inc. v. The Rug Market, </em>238 F.3d 391, 398-99 (5th Cir. 2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b317-18\">Caraballo also asserts that he was denied meaningful access to the courts because he was unable to assist his attorney during his direct appeal by conducting legal research. Because Caraballo had court-appointed counsel on appeal, he had no constitutional right of access to a law library in preparing his defense, and Caraballo failed to state a claim for which relief may be granted. <em>See Degrate v. Godwin, </em>84 F.3d 768, 768-69 (5th Cir.1996). Moreover, Caraballo does not assert a \u201crelevant actual injury\u201d regarding his criminal appeal. <em>See Lewis, </em>518 U.S. at 351, 116 S.Ct. 2174.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-19\">Caraballo further contends that the fact that the district court did not permit him to cure the alleged defect in his pleadings demonstrates that he has been denied meaningful access to the courts. This argument is meritless. Caraballo\u2019s complaint was that the defendants had denied him access to the courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-20\">Finally, Caraballo asserts that he is presently preparing a petition for writ of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>certiorari to the Supreme Court and that he is unable to do so without legal materials translated into Spanish \u201cor legal assistance of some type.\u201d We do not consider this new issue on appeal. <em>See Stewart Glass &amp; Mirror, Inc. v. U.S. Auto Glass Discount Ctrs., Inc., </em>200 F.3d 307, 316-17 (5th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b318-4\">Caraballo\u2019s appeal is without arguable merit and is frivolous. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983). It is therefore DISMISSED. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2. Caraballo is CAUTIONED that the dismissal of this appeal as frivolous counts as a strike under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g), as does the district court\u2019s dismissal of his complaint. <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, 103 F.3d 383, 387-88 </em>(5th Cir. 1996). Caraballo is CAUTIONED that if he accumulates three strikes under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g), he will not be able to proceed IFP in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">APPEAL DISMISSED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b317-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
