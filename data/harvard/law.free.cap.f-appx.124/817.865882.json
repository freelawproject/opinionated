No decision on removability is valid unless it is based upon reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence. <em>Id. </em>Our review of a final order of removal is limited, however. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b) (2000). The IJ\u2019s underlying factual findings are conclusive \u201cunless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary,\u201d while the Board\u2019s decision that an alien is not eligible for admission is conclusive unless manifestly contrary to law. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B), (C).</p>\n<p id=\"b849-22\">We have carefully reviewed the record and conclude it does not compel a finding that the warrant Khan submitted in support of his asylum application is authentic or that his testimony before the IJ was credible. Khan has therefore failed to establish that the Board\u2019s decision was manifestly contrary to law.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-23\">Accordingly, we deny the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-24\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
