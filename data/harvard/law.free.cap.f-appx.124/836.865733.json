More specifically, Appellants (BRI employees whom the district court previously held not entitled to benefits under BRI\u2019s Change in Control and Employee Severance Protection Plan), alternatively sought benefits from the Severance Plan. They contend that \u2014 despite their ineligibility for benefits under the literal terms of the Severance Plan \u2014 they are nevertheless owed benefits under that plan because (1) the actions of BRI constituted \u201cinterference\u201d with their rights to obtain benefits, in contravention of 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1140 (\u201cERISA \u00a7 510\u201d); and (2) specified management personnel of BRI and the Plan Administrator breached their fiduciary duties to Appellants in violation of 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1104. Appellants also appeal the district court\u2019s denial of statutory penalties under 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(c) for the alleged fiduciary breaches. For essentially the same reasons extensively and patiently set forth by the district court in its Ruling filed on July 23, 2004, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-6\">We have carefully reviewed the briefs and other filings of counsel, the record in this case, including the applicable plan documents, and the aforesaid Ruling of the district court. As a result, we are convinced that the claims of Appellants are without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-7\">First, Appellants\u2019 interference claim under \u00a7 510 of ERISA cannot overcome the analysis and holding of <em>Bodine v. Emplrs. Cas. Co.</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Appellants have failed to show that BRI somehow took prohibited action for the purpose of interfering with Appellants\u2019 attainment of any right to which they were entitled. As Appellants were entitled to no existing enforceable rights, they were required to show that BRI\u2019s actions were taken for the purpose of interfering with rights to which Appellants might thereafter become entitled under the plan in question. Based on the essentially undisputed facts of this case, the district court correctly concluded that the actions by and on behalf of BRI were not taken for the <em>purpose </em>of interfering with rights to which they might have become entitled. To the contrary, the actions were legitimately taken to ensure continued and uninterrupted employment of Appellants by Baker Energy, BRI\u2019s successor in the Gulf of Mexico activities, both in terms of structure and amount of compensation. That BRI was also motivated by its non-discriminatory desire to avoid a break in service for these experienced personnel that could result from unintended and unwarranted severance payments is of no moment. Avoiding the inadvertent creation of a negative incentive for Appellants\u2019 continued, uninterrupted work when changing employers from BRI to Baker Energy does not constitute purposeful interference with obtaining benefits to which Appellants had no current entitlement or expectation of future entitlement if hired without a break in service by Baker Energy. Under these circumstances, the reasoning and holding of our opinion in <em>Bodine </em>bars a determination of actionable \u201cinterference\u201d within the intendment of \u00a7 510 of ERISA.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"838\">*838</page-number>Furthermore, in light of the unique nature of fiduciary relationships under ERISA, which recognizes that fiduciaries can wear \u201ctwo hats,\u201d a simple test of undivided loyalty is inapt. Absent any showing of deceptive practices, misrepresentations, or other untoward acts, the Appellants\u2019 fiduciary breach claims miss the mark entirely. We need not waste judicial resources or paper in reiterating the detailed analysis and conclusion so ably provided by the district court in its eminently correct Ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-4\">Finally, given our affirmance of the district court\u2019s rejection of Appellants\u2019 substantive claims for interference and for breach of fiduciary duty, they have no viable basis of entitlement to statutory penalties under 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132(c). We affirm the district court\u2019s rejection of this claim as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-5\">The district court\u2019s Final Judgment, filed August 11, 2004 on the basis of its aforesaid Ruling, is, in all respects, AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b869-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b869-14\">. 352 F.3d 245 (5th Cir.2003).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
