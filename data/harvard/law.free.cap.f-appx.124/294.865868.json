As to his asylum application, Momin challenges the BIA\u2019s determination that his application was untimely under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(2). This court lacks jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s determination that Momin\u2019s asylum application was untimely. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b327-7\">Momin argues that the BIA erred in denying his application for withholding of removal. Substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s determination that Momin has not met his burden to establish an entitlement to withholding of removal. <em>See Efe v. Ashcroft, </em>293 F.3d 899, 906 (5th Cir. 2002); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b327-8\">Momin\u2019s petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b327-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
