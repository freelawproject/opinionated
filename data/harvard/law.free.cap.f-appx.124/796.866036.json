Schneider, a state prisoner, seeks to appeal the district court\u2019s order accepting the recommendation of the magistrate judge and denying his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 (2000) petition as untimely. This order is not appealable unless a circuit justice or judge issues a certificate of appealability. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1); <em>see Reid v. Angelone, </em>369 F.3d 363, 368-69, 374 n. 7 (4th Cir.2004). A certificate of appealability will not issue absent \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2) (2000). A prisoner satisfies this standard by demonstrating that reasonable jurists would find that the district court\u2019s assessment of his constitutional claims is debatable and that any dispositive procedural findings by the district court are also debatable or wrong. <em>See Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 336-38, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003); <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000); <em>Rose v. Lee, </em>252 F.3d 676, 683 (4th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b829-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"797\">*797</page-number>We have independently reviewed the record and conclude that Schneider has not shown the district court\u2019s finding of untimeliness to be debatable or wrong.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Accordingly, we deny a certificate of appealability and dismiss the appeal. We dispense with oral argument, because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-5\">\n<em>DISMISSED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b829-18\"> Schneider does not challenge the court\u2019s finding of untimeliness on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
