In rejecting Omar\u2019s appeal, the BIA adopted the Immigration Judge\u2019s (IJ) findings that Omar lacked credibility. We hold that the IJ\u2019s credibility findings were reasonable and supported by substantial evidence. <em>See Chun v. INS, </em>40 F.3d 76, 79 (5th Cir.1994). Accordingly, Omar\u2019s pro se petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b313-20\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
