We dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction because the notice of appeal was not timely filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-22\">Parties are accorded thirty days after the entry of the district court\u2019s final judgment or order to note an appeal, Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(1)(A), unless the district court extends the appeal period under Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(5) or reopens the appeal period under Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(6). This appeal period is \u201cmandatory and jurisdictional.\u201d <em>Browder v. Director, Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>434 U.S. 257, 264, 98 S.Ct. 556, 54 L.Ed.2d 521 (1978) (quoting <em>United States v. Robinson, </em>361 U.S. 220, 229, 80 S.Ct. 282, 4 L.Ed\u00fcd 259 (I960)). The district court\u2019s order was entered on the docket on November 19, 2004. The notice of appeal was filed, at the earliest, on January 24, 2005.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Because Wells failed to file a timely notice of appeal or to obtain an extension or reopening of the appeal period, we deny a certificate of appealability, deny Wells\u2019 motions for bail pending appeal and for production of documents, and dismiss the appeal. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-23\">\n<em>DISMISSED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b845-19\"> For the purpose of this appeal, we assume that the date appearing on the notice of appeal is the earliest date it could have been properly delivered to prison officials for mailing to the court. <em>See </em>Fed.
