The district court sentenced Washington to 102 months\u2019 imprisonment, consisting of a forty-two-month sentence on the \u00a7 922(g) offense, and a consecutive sixty-month term on the \u00a7 924(c) offense. The district court also specified an identical alternative sentence of 102 months pursuant to this court\u2019s recommendation in <em>United States v. Hammond, </em>378 F.3d 426 (4th Cir.2004) (order), <em>opinion issued by </em>381 F.3d 316, 353-54 (4th Cir.2004) (en banc), <em>cert. granted and judgment vacated, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014 , 125 S.Ct. 1051, 160 L.Ed.2d 997 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b841-23\">Washington appealed, challenging the constitutionality of the federal sentencing scheme in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014 , 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004). Washington specifically challenges the determination of his offense level under the guidelines by reference to a prior conviction as a conviction for a controlled substance offense. The case was held in abeyance pending the decision in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014 , 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). That opinion has now issued and applied the Court\u2019s reasoning in <em>Blakely </em>to the federal sentencing guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-29\">We conclude that, because the alternative sentence the district court pronounced in case the federal sentencing guidelines were invalidated was identical to the mandatory sentence imposed under the federal sentencing guidelines as they existed at that time, any error resulting from the sentence imposed by the district court was harmless. <em>See Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S. at \u2014 , 125 S.Ct. at 769. Accordingly, we affirm Washington\u2019s sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-32\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
