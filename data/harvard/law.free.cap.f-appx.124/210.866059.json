We review the denial of a motion to reopen for abuse of discretion. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(a) (2004). <em>See INS v. Doherty, </em>502 U.S. 314, 323-24, 112 S.Ct. 719, 116 L.Ed.2d 823 (1992) (stating abuse of discretion standard); <em>Stewart v. INS, </em>181 F.3d 587, 595 (4th Cir.1999) (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b242-19\">In his brief to this court, Tuladhar seeks to reargue his entitlement to asylum. However, this petition for review is untimely as to the Board\u2019s July 25, 2002 order affirming the immigration judge\u2019s denial of Tuladhar\u2019s applications for asylum and withholding of removal. <em>See Stone v. INS, </em>514 U.S. 386, 405-06, 115 S.Ct. 1537, 131 L.Ed.2d 465 (1995) (holding that time for filing petition for review is jurisdictional and unaffected by filing motion to reopen). The petition for review is timely only as to the Board\u2019s denial of the second motion to reopen. Tuladhar presents no arguments relevant to the denial of that motion. Therefore, he has waived review of any claims arising from the denial of the second motion to reopen. <em>See United States v. Al-Hamdi, </em>356 F.3d 564, 571 n. 8 (4th Cir.2004); <em>Edwards v. City of Goldsboro, </em>178 F.3d 231, 241 n. 6 (4th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b242-21\">Thus, we deny the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-22\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
