Counsel filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), asserting there are no non-frivolous grounds for appeal, but suggesting that the term of imprisonment imposed by the district court is unreasonable.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Bush was notified of his right to file a pro se supplemental brief, but he has not done so.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-12\">We have reviewed the record and conclude that Bush\u2019s sentence is within the statutory maximum sentencing range, and the district court\u2019s revocation proceedings otherwise comport with due process. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583 (2000). Moreover, we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in sentencing Bush to the maximum term permitted by statute. Finding no error, we affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-18\">This court requires that counsel inform her client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-19\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b243-13\"> Because the sentencing guidelines relating to revocation of supervised release have always been advisory, <em>see U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>Ch. 7 Pt. A, the sentence in this appeal is not impacted by the decision in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>- U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
