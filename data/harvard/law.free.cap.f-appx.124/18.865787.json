The firm, Zimmer &amp; Associates, is run by Celita and Ronald Zimmer, both Caymanians by citizenship or grant of status. After the business relationship broke down over payment issues, Gargano filed suit in federal district court in Massachu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>setts, asserting various contract, fraud, and unfair practices claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-5\">The magistrate judge recommended granting a motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction pursuant to Fed. R.Civ.P. 12(b)(2), assessing in detail the multi-faceted \u201cminimum contacts\u201d and \u201cgestalt\u201d factors and finding that both sets of considerations worked against the plaintiff. <em>See Burger King Corp. v. Rudzewicz, </em>471 U.S. 462, 471-78, 105 S.Ct. 2174, 85 L.Ed.2d 528 (1985); <em>Ticketmaster-New York, Inc. v. Alioto, </em>26 F.3d 201, 206-12 (1st Cir.1994). The district judge adopted the magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation, dismissing the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-6\">If the plaintiff met the necessary showing of \u201cminimum contacts,\u201d and it is not at all clear that he did, he would have done so at best by a small margin \u2014 one that the \u201cgestalt\u201d factors weighing against jurisdiction in this case easily overcome. Accordingly, on this second ground, we readily affirm, substantially for the reasons given by the magistrate judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-7\">\n<em>It is so ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
