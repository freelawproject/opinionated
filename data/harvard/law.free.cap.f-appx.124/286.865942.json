Serjani does not brief the BIA\u2019s denial of relief under the CAT. Accordingly, Serjani has waived the claim. <em>See Rodriguez v. INS, </em>9 F.3d 408, 414 n. 15 (5th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b319-10\">Serjani argues that the BIA\u2019s determination that he was not entitled to asylum and to withholding of removal was not supported by substantial evidence. He relies on testimony that he suffered a beating at the hands of a gang of Muslim youths in 1993. Because Serjani has failed to show that the evidence is so compelling that no reasonable factfinder could conclude against the BIA\u2019s determination that he is not entitled to asylum, we must affirm that finding. <em>See Carbajal-Gonzalez v. INS, </em>78 F.3d 194, 197 (5th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"An4\">As Serjani has not made the showing required to obtain asylum, he has not met the more demanding standard for withholding of removal. <em>See Efe v. Ashcroft, </em>293 F.3d 899, 903 (5th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"A1s\">The Respondent\u2019s motion for summary affirmance in lieu of filing a brief, or, in the alternative, to reset the time for filing a brief, is DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"ACO\">PETITION DENIED; RESPONDENT\u2019S MOTION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b319-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
