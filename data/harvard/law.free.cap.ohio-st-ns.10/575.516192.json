Where an indictment, in a count charging a burglary, under section 14 of the statute, avers the intent to steal the \u201cpersonal property,\u201d of a person named, without an express allegation that the property is of any value, the count is sufficient; the term \u201c property,\u201d <em>ex vi termini, </em>importing value.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b475-11\">A judgment on a general verdict of guilty on an indictment containing some good and some bad counts, is not erroneous because not rendered with express reference to the good counts.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b475-12\">Whit of error to the common pleas of Butler county. Beserved -in the district court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b475-13\">*At the February term, 1854, of the court of common jileas of Butler county, John Boose was indicted for robbery and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>burglary, in different counts of the same indictment. These crimes are charged to have been committed January 22, 1854, The indictment contains four counts ; the first and second for rob bery, and the third and fourth for burglary.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b476-5\">Both counts for robbery charge the crime to have been committed upon one Abraham Werner in his dwelling-house; and that said Boose, certain bank-bills of a. specified denomination and value, \u201c of the personal property of the said Abraham Werner, from the person and against the will of the said Abraham Werner, in the dwelling-house aforesaid, then and there feloniously and violently did seize, take, and carry away, contrary to the form of the statute,\u201d etc.; there being no allegation, in either count, of an intent to steal or rob.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b476-6\">In the counts for burglary in breaking and entering the dwelling-house of said Werner, the intent charged is, in one of them, to' steal \u201c the personal property\u201d of said Werner; and in the other, to rob him of his \u201cpersonal property.\u201d There is no express allegation that the property is of any value.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b476-7\">At the same term, the plaintiff in error pleaded not guilty, and went to trial; \u201c and a jury being impaneled, and sworn the truth to speak upon the issue joined between the parties,\u2019\u2019 and \u201c having\u2019 heard all the evidence of the parties, the arguments of counsel,, and the charge of the court, upon their oaths do say that the said John Boose is guilty in manner and form as in said indictment is alleged against him.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b476-8\">Thereupon the plaintiff in error moved to set aside the verdict, and for a now trial, for the alleged reasons that the verdict was against the weight of the evidence and the law. This motion, was overruled, and a judgment and sentence of imprisonment in the penitentiary was entered on the verdict against the plaintiff in error. To reverse this ^judgment and sentence, the plaintiff in error procured the allowance of a writ of error to the common pleas, returnable to the district court, in which the case was reserved for decision in this court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b476-9\"><em>Clark, Christy, Thomas Millikin, </em>and <em>Alexander F. Sume, </em>for plaintiff in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b476-10\">1. We claim that the first two counts of the indictment-are defective in not alleging that the property described was taken from the person of Werner \u201c <em>with intent to rob or steal.\"</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b477-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>2. In regard to the third and fourth counts, we claim that the <em>property </em>therein mentioned should have been averred to be of some-value. It is true that in Spencer <em>v. </em>The State, 13 Ohio, 401, the \u2022court hold that the term <em>goods and </em>chattels, <em>ex vi </em>termini, implies value; yet in the same case the court intimate that had the word <em>property </em>been used instead of <em>goods and, </em>chattels, the decision would have been different; \u201c for,\u201d say the court, \u201c a man may have a bare property in dogs or animals which, by the common law, are cf no intrinsic value.\u201d See also Wharton\u2019s Amer. Or. Law, 553. In using the words \u201c property of <em>any value </em>\u201d in our statutory definition of burglary, the legislature evidently intended to discriminate those species of property which are, in the eye of the law, <em>valuable, </em>\u2022and those which are intrinsically of <em>no </em>value. As the term \u201c personal property \u201d is broad enough to cover both species of property, it is necessary that there should be an averment that the property was of <em>some </em>value.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b477-5\">3. We claim that the oath administered to the jury who tried the case was insufficient. The jury should have been sworn to well and truly try the issue joined between the parties, and a true verdict render <em>according to the evidence; </em>whereas they were simply sworn <em>\u201c </em>the truth to speak upon the issue joined between the parties.\u201d This left the jury to determine the issue upon their own. private knowledge *of the facts, or upon any grounds <em>outside \u25a0of the evidence, </em>to them satisfactory.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b477-6\">4. Should the court be of opinion that some of the counts are <em>good, </em>and some <em>bad, </em>then we claim that, as judgment was rendered alike upon the good and bad counts, that it is erroneous.
