In order to justify the reversal of a judgment or decree upon error, the record must show affirmatively, not only that error intervened, but that it was to the prejudice of the party seeking to take advantage of it.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b460-12\">2. Where an improved city lot is described by the appraisers as containing thirty feet front, more or less, and in that connection they certify the value of the lot to be \u201c S260 per front foot, for <em>ground and improvements,\" </em>and the same description is carried into the advertisement and the return of sale, and it subsequently appears that the lot was only twenty-seven feet front, it is not competent under the statute to confirm the sale, and at the same time deduct from the aggregate purchase money the price paid, per front foot, for the deficiency.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b460-14\">3. In the exercise of the power conferred by the statute, the court should either confirm or set aside the sale, but should not modify its terms.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b460-16\">4. Where an appraisement or sale is fairly susceptible of two interpretations, if the variance is material, the court would be justified, genez-ally, in setting the same aside, and ordering a resale.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b460-18\">6. Where the question as to the regularity of a decree is taken from a special 'term of the Superior Court of Cincinnati, on petition in error, to a general* term, and the decree is there reversed, and one of the defendants in error files a petition in error in the Supreme Court to reverse such judgment of reversal, he can not assign, as cause of reversal, the non-joinder with him of another party in the original petition in error, unless such objection was made in the ge\u00e1eral term, by answer or otherwise.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b460-19\">Error to the Superior Court of Cincinnati.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b460-20\">In April, 1855, Josiah Higdon filed, in the Superior Court of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>\u25a0Cincinnati, his petition to enforce a lien for a paving tax, assessed by the city of Cincinnati, against certain real estate *owned \u25a0by James and Samuel II. Goodin, hereinafter described.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b461-4\">To that petition all persons having liens upon said real estate were made parties defendant, among whom were Thomas B. May-bee and the Ohio Bife Insurance and Trust Company.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b461-5\">Both Maybee and the Ohio Bile Insurance and Trust Company filed answers and cross-petitions, claiming affirmative relief against the Goodins, and for a foreclosure of certain mortgages which they \u2022held on said real estate.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b461-6\">At the June term, 1856, of said court, a judgment was rendered in favor of the plaintiff and against James and Samuel H. Goodin, for \u00a7145.90 and interest from October 1,1855; and at its November term, 1856, a decree was taken against the Goodins, upon the cross-petition of Maybee, for the amount due him upon his mortgage, .and for a sale of the real estate described in the petition.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b461-7\">The Goodins had been the owners of the property described in the original petition and mortgaged to Maybee, for about forty years prior to the time of the sale hereinafter stated.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b461-8\">It is described in the deed to them, as it is in the mortgage to Maybee, as follows: \u201c Being lot No. 8, and 38 feet in width, of the west side of lot No. 7, as known in the plat of subdivision made by Arthur St. Clair, and fronting on the south side of Court street eighty-three feet, and running back between parallel lines ninety feet deep.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b461-9\">More than twenty-five years before the commencement of Hig\u25a0don\u2019s suit, the city of Cincinnati condemned three feet of the east side of the premises described in the petition, for the purpose of an .alley, for which the city paid the Goodins the sum of $230, the full value of the three feet at that time. Ever since, said alley has been kept open by the city, and has been used by the public as a \u2022common thoroughfare, known as <em>\u201cGoleman alley.\u201d</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b461-10\">The description in the deed to the Goodins for said property seems to have been adopted by Higdon in his petition, *with\u25a0out regard to the three feet which had been condemned by the city.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b461-11\">The Goodins, in their mortgages to Maybee and the Trust Company, also followed the description of the original deed to them, .although they were not, nor had they been, the owners of three feet on the east side of it, for many years. There are three distinct tenements on that portion of the property retained by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>Goodins, which cover the entire fronton Court street, to wit, eighty feet.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b462-5\">When an order of sale issued under the decree of Maybee, the sheriff subdivided the property with a view to the three tenement\u00bb on it, for the purpose of appraisement and sale under it, which \u25a0subdivision was appraised and confirmed by said court.

In this, however, they were mistaken, there being but twenty-seven feet front to the lot.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b463-6\">On the 10th day of April, 1857, the Goodins moved the court .to set aside the sale to Stallo, assigning as one of the reasons, that \u201c the price was grossly inadequate ; \u201d but the court, on the 11th day of April term, 1857, confirmed the sales so made to Stallo and others, ordered deeds to be made to the purchasers, and the proceeds of said sale to be distributed. On the 23d day of said April term, being twelve days after this order of distribution, and after distribution made, Stallo having obtained possession of the premises purchased by him, discovered that said subdivision No. 3 was but 27 feet front, instead of 30 feet, and thereupon filed a motion in said court to have the mistake corrected.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b463-7\">The motion of Stallo was supported by the following affidavits and evidence:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b463-8\">Jefferson Buckingham, then a deputy sheriff of ^Hamilton county, says, that he made an actual survey of lot No. 3, sheriff\u2019s subdivision, which is marked thereon as measuring thirty feet, <em>more or less: </em>that it measures only twenty-seven feet; and that it was sold to Stallo <em>by the front foot.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b463-9\">John W.

The supplemental decree directed it to refund $633 of that money to J. B. Stallo, and to look to the Goodins for the sum so refunded. The decree of general term reversed this supplemental order, and reinstated the \u25a0original order of distribution; and it is difficult to see why tho plaintiff in error should complain of such a result. It may be that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>the G-oodins did not obtain a <em>*supersedeas </em>on filing their petition in error, and it may also bo that the plaintiff in error had in fact paid over the money to Stallo before the revising order at general term; but we can not infer either, and much less both of these-facts, from the record before us. These considerations would, doubtless, warrant us in affirming the decree of the general term, <em>as-against the plaintiff in error, </em>without further remark as to the regularity of that decree, or the one it reversed ; but inasmuch as some-of the points relied on by the plaintiff in error are of much practical importance, we have concluded briefly to consider them. The most important of these is, whether the court at special term, upon the record and proof before them, erred in allowing the <em>pro~ rata </em>deduction of $633 from the purchase money paid by J. B. Stallo. The most that the record and proofs established or tended to establish, was, that the sheriff, appraisers-, and purchaser understood and believed that lot No. 3, running to the alley, was thirty, instead of twenty-seven feet front, and that, so believing, it was advertised, appraised, and sold by the feet front. At said special term Stallo claimed, and the court seem to have supposed, that it was to be assimilated to the case of a mere mistake in computation, which could be coi\u2019reeted by mere recomjoutation\u2014multiplying the true number of feet front by the price bid per foot. In this we think there was manifest error. If the lot was wholly unimpi*oved, or if the improvements had been separately estimated, there would have-been some color for the assumption. There were three distinct tenements upon the mortgaged promises, covering the entire ground from alley to alley, and the tract was so subdivided that one of the tenements stood upon each lot. The house upon lot No. 3 extended to the Coleman alley, and was believed to be thirty feet wide, and with reason, for there was that much ground of the premises described in the mortgage lying west of lot No. 2. The appraisers believing thus,and beingupontheground,certifythat,upon actual view of that ^particular lot, they estimated the value of the <em>ground and improvements </em>at $260 per foot front. May it not, with reason, be claimed that they estimated <em>what they viewed </em>as worth thirty times two hundred and sixty dollars ? But, again, the purchaser gets with his twenty seven feet <em>all the improvements </em>which entered into their estimate of the value of the entire lot. How much of this estimate was for the <em>\u201c </em>ground,\u201d and how much for the <em>\u201c </em>improvements,\u201d does not appear, and no computation could have ascertained it. For <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>aught we know, the improvements may have been very valuable and entered largely into the estimate, so much so, indeed, as to have-induced the appraisers to increase the rate, had they been advised' of the true width of the lot.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">We are aware that the appraisement and terms of sale would bear the construction claimed by the plaintiff in error, that is, an appraisement and sale of the lot at a specified price per foot, and its frontage to be subsequently ascertained; but we also think they may fairly be construed as a valuation of the ground and improvements at thirty times the sum of $260, and as a sale at thirty times-the sum of $211; and we also think the latter construction best suited to the conduct of judicial sales under the statute. Such seems to have been the construction at first put upon it by purchaser and sheriff in this case. There was no previous measurement to-ascertain the frontage of the lot, and no express reservation of a right to do so, before or at the time the money was paid, which was several days prior to filing the motion at special term, one month after the sale. The statute does not contemplate a survey, t\u00ab) ascertain the amount of purchase money, before it is demand-able. It is payable immediately, though the sheriff may, for his-own security, retain it until confirmation. Judicial sales should always be certain, and not subject to any future contingencies, so-that all bidders may have equal advantages. All such sales, whether by judgment or decree, are regulated by the same statute, and the power of the courts is very properly limited *to a confirmation or vacation of the sale, as to which they are to exercise a sound, legal discretion, and in which all parties\u2014the plaintiff, the defendant, and the purchaser\u2014may be heard. The power is to <em>confirm </em>or <em>set </em>aside, <em>but not to modify the sale, or its terms. </em>In the exercise of this power, courts may, doubtless, confirm a sale, and at the same time coi\u2019reet any mere error or mistake made in-the computation, where the records and papers furnish all the elements for making the correction; but they are not, while thus acting, invested with general powers to hear testimony in order to-correct mistakes and give effect to the intention of the parties to a sale. The power to confirm or set aside, if properly exercised, will afford ample protection to the parties and to the purchaser, and there, in our judgment, this summary power of the court over the matter should terminate. If, from misapprehension or other cause, the sale ought not to be confirmed, as it was made, the best and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>-only proper remedy is a resale, with or without a revaluation, as justice may require. Again, the Goodins did in fact own the fee \u2022of thirty feet west of lot No. 2, though three feet of its westernmost side, was subject to the public easement; and it is questionable whether the fee of that three feet, subject to the easement, did not pass to Stallo by the sale, notwithstanding the call of an alley in the description of the lot sold to him. The appropriation for an indefinite period to public uses, might constitute a ground for setting aside the sale at the instance of the purchaser, but none whatever for a reduction of the purchase money. The cases cited by the counsel for the plaintiff in error to the point, that purchasers of real estate under a decree of court, where a mistake is made in the quantity purchased, are entitled to a confirmation of the sale and a reduction for the actual deficiency of ground, do not sustain the position for which they are cited. They are all cases, not of judicial sales, but of contracts for the sale of land, in which the chancery powers of the court were invoked to enforce performance according to the terms of the agreement and the intent of the parties, and for obvious reasons do not apply to judicial sales under the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">\u00a5e are therefore of the opinion that the court, at special term, \u2022erred in making the deduction of $633 from the money paid by J. B. Stallo. His relief, if he was entitled to any, was to have the \u2022sale set aside; but this he did not ask, and, from the record, we presume did not desire.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-6\">The plaintiff in error also insists that the decree of reversal at general term was erroneous, because Stallo had a legal right to be heard, and was not made a party thereto. All this may be true, and yet the objection, so far as the plaintiff in error is concerned, comes too late. The objection should have been made at the general term by the plaintiff in error or some of the defendants. Having gone to a hearing upon the petition in error, and, so far as the record shows, without objection, the plaintiff in error can not now complain.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b468-8\">Brinkerhorr, C.
