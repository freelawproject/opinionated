George Gardner, Judge, presiding.</summary><summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b137-14\" pgmap=\"137(28) 138(350) 139(226)\">This was a hill in equity, in the Superior Court of Cook county, by Thomas H. Ball, Herman Prenzlauer and Simon Florsheim, against Ferdinand Siegel, Henry Siegel, Emanuel Siegel and Gustav Schilling, to enjoin the use of appellants\u2019 trade mark, adopted to designate corsets manufactured by them, and also to enjoin appellees from copying hand-bills, labels, advertisements, and circulars and bills. The bill alleges that appellants are owners of certain letters patent for corsets of a certain construction, which they commenced to manufacture in 1880; that these corsets were constructed with coiled wire elastic sections in the sides of the corsets, extending from under the arms down over the hips; that these coiled wire elastic sections gave the corset a different exterior appearance from any other known corsets, so that cuts representing these corsets appeared differently from any other cuts or pictures; that in 1880 the appellants adopted the name of \u201cBall\u2019s Health-preserving Corsets\u201d for their corsets, which they manufactured under these patents; that they printed this name upon a label which they applied to the end of the box in which each corset 'Was put up and sold; that they also put a label of the size of the cover of this corset box thereon, on which were printed certificates of recommendation signed by eminent physicians of Chicago; and they also printed a circular or hand-bill, setting forth the special merits of their new corsets, one of which was placed in each box with the corset; that in addition to these three labels that accompanied each corset sold by appellants, appellants printed what they termed an advertisement, showing a picture of their particular style of corset. They set forth in this advertisement the merits of their particular style of corset, calling it \u201cBall\u2019s Health-preserving Corset, \u201d made of elastic sections of coiled wire spring, etc. In addition to this, appellants also issued what they called a bill of sale circular, which they placed in the hands of merchants, setting forth the merits of the \u201cBall Health-preserving Corsets.\u201d They also issued an envelope, of the size used by merchants who sell small packages, upon which was the picture of the corset, with the name of \u201cBall\u2019s Health-preserving Corset,\u201d and upon the reverse side the recommendation of the physicians, and this envelope was distributed to merchants, etc., as an advertisement. The bill then charges that after appellants had established a large trade for their corsets, appellees commenced manufacturing precisely the same corset; that appellees adopted for the name of their corset, \u201cSchilling\u2019s Health-preserving Corset;\u201d that they obtained certificates from the same number of prominent physicians of Chicago as appellants had, using the same language, and having the respective certificates of about the same length as the certificates of appellants, and had them printed in the same form on a label of a size to exactly fit the top of the cover of the box, designating their corset as \u201c Schilling\u2019s Health-preserving Corset; \u201d that appellees printed the same circular or hand-bill which the appellants had printed and placed inside of each box containing their \u201cBall\u2019s Health-preserving Corset,\u201d using substantially the same language, except heading it \u201cDr. Schilling\u2019s Health-preserving Corset,\u201d and placed one of them in each box with each corset; that appellees also copied the advertisement, making the same cut representing the same elastic coiled wire sections in the corset, and that appellees also copied the bill of sale circular that was furnished to the dealers largely, excepting they called their corset \u201cSchilling\u2019s Health-preserving Corset,\u201d having substantially the same language of recommendation and commendation.</summary><summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b139-5\" pgmap=\"139\">Motion was made before the Superior Court for a temporary injunction, and the court denied the motion. Thereupon the counsel for the respective parties entered into a stipulation, which, omitting the caption and signatures of counsel, is as follows:</summary><summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b139-6\" pgmap=\"139(52) 140(235)\">\u201cIt is stipulated and agreed by and between the above named parties, through their solicitors, that the defendants\u2019 demurrer in said cause may he withdrawn by leave of the court; that the judge may enter an order dismissing the bill in this ease, and allow an appeal to the Appellate Court for the First District, to the complainants, from said decision dismissing the bill, upon a sufficient bond being filed by the complainants; that said hearing on said 21st day of May-may be considered as a final hearing, and that the several affidavits and exhibits and other proofs adduced and submitted by the complainants may be considered as original evidence tending to prove the facts alleged in the complainants\u2019 bill of complaint, and the affidavits and other proofs adduced and submitted as evidence on the part of the defendants at said hearing may be considered as original evidence tending to show the facts as claimed by the defendants, and that the bill of exceptions in this case to be made and certified to by the court may consist of the bill of complaint and the affidavits, exhibits and proofs adduced, respectively, on the part of the complainants and defendants, so that the evidence in the ease to be considered by the Appellate Court may be made up of said affidavits and exhibits adduced by the respective parties, and now on file in said cause; and the clerk, in making up the bill of exceptions, shall incorporate in said bill, as evidence in the case, the aforesaid affidavits and exhibits used by the respective parties as aforesaid, all such evidence to be considered by the Appellate Court, subject to all legal objections. \u201d</summary><summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b140-5\" pgmap=\"140(124) 141(30)\">In pursuance thereto the court ordered and decreed, first, that the defendants be allowed to withdraw their demurrer heretofore filed herein; and second, that the bill of complaint herein be dismissed at the cost of the complainants, the complainants\u2019 motion for an injunction having been overruled. And the complainants pray an appeal from the order of the court dismissing the bill of complaint, to the Appellate Court in and for the First District, which is allowed on filing the complainants\u2019 individual bond, without security, in the sum of $300, the said bond to be filed on or before the 3d day of September, A. D. 1883; and the certificate of evidence, prepared in accordance with the said stipulation on file, shall be signed and filed on or before the 1st day of October, 1883.

Dec. 292, 293. See, also, Upton on Trade Marks, 114, et seq.; Brown on Trade Marks, secs. 164, 657, 658. It is well settled, moreover, that directions, advertisements, notices, etc., constitute no part of a trade mark, (Candee, Swan &amp; Co. v. Deere &amp; Co. 54 Ill. 462,) and that no one can obtain a trade mark in the form, appearance or finish of his goods, so that another can not lawfully make his goods like them. (Candee, Swan &amp; Co. v. Deere &amp; Co. supra; Brown on Trade Marks, sec. 605.) Nor can there be a trade mark in the form or color of a package or box. Morgan\u2019s Sons Co. v. Troxell, 89 N. Y. 292; Moorman v. Hoge, 2 Sawyer, 78; Harrington v. Libby, 14 Blatchf. 128.</p> <p id=\"b143-8\" pgmap=\"143(61) 144(79)\">Conceding that appellants had a trade mark in the name of \u201cBall, \u201d and in the picture and words and form of lettering on the labels pasted on their boxes, it is evident that the name, \u201c Schilling, \u201d or \u201cDr. Schilling, \u201d could not be mistaken for that of \u201cBall, \u201d and that if the picture, words and form of lettering on the labels pasted on appellees\u2019 boxes were totally unlike those pasted on appellants\u2019 boxes, the one could not reasonably be mistaken for the other, and there could, in neither respect, be any infringement of a trade mark. The only question is, whether appellees were, hy devices and false representations, as charged in the bill, selling or causing to be sold their corset, when the purchasers were desiring to purchase, and supposed they were purchasing, appellants\u2019 corset.</p> <p id=\"b144-4\" pgmap=\"144(280) 145(368)\">Affidavits were read in evidence by appellants to prove active efforts by appellees to sell Schilling\u2019s corsets as Ball\u2019s corsets; but some of them were inadmissible becaus.6 based on mere hearsay, and others were insufficient because proving acts only of third parties, and not sufficiently connecting appellees with them, either by showing that they were done under the direction of appellees or with their approval. The balance of appellants\u2019 affidavits were neutralized by counter-affidavits on behalf of appellees\u2014at least so far that we can not say the allegations of the bill resting on them for support' are clearly proved. The boxes in which appellees\u2019 corsets are placed to be sold, are of the same shape, size and general color as those in which appellants\u2019 corsets are placed to be sold. It does not appear, however, that there is anything unusual in the shape or structure or color of these boxes, and, so far as we perceive, this similarity may result from the use required, and the convenience of the makers of the boxes \u2014at all events, it does not appear that this may not be so, and we regard it a reasonable inference in the absence of all proof as to purpose or motive. The labels on the boxes are dissimilar. That on the end of appellants\u2019 box has the picture of a corset, and reads: \u201cBall\u2019s Health-preserving Corset.\u2014Drab.\u2014. . . . Size. \u201d That on the end of appellees\u2019 box has no picture of a corset or of anything else. It reads: \u201cDr. Schilling\u2019s Self-adjusting Corset.\u2014Drab.\u2014.... Size.\u201d The lettering is unlike in every respect. The types are different, the lines run in different directions, and the reading is different. The most casual observer would, at any distance at which he could distinguish the appearance of these labels from labels of any other description, distinguish the difference. The label on the top of the lid of appellants\u2019 box has, in the centre, lengthwise, a picture of a corset, with lettering on each side extending irregularly upward and downward, parallel with and corresponding to the irregular outline of the sides of the corset, reading, on the one side, \u201cCoiled Spring,\u201d and on the other, \u201cElastic Section, \u201d and over the picture of the corset, in a single line running lengthwise with the label, the beginning and ending being about equi-distant from the ends, is printed, in caps, the words, \u201cWhat Eminent Chicago Physicians say of it.\u201d The label on the top of the lid of appellees\u2019 box has no picture of a corset upon it, but it has, in the centre, lengthwise of the label, a picture of Dr. Schilling. There is no lettering of any kind, either extending perpendicularly, parallel with, or over this picture, as on the other label; but to the right and left of the picture, in the upper margin and near each end of the lid, in distinct single lines of caps, are printed, in each line, the words, \u201cOpinions of Eminent Physicians of Chicago.\u201d On both labels, on each side of the pictures, are physicians\u2019 certificates,\u2014those on the one certifying to the excellence of the \u201cBall Corset, \u201d and those on the other to that of the \u201cSchilling Corset,\u201d\u2014and appended to these are what purport to be fac similes of the signatures of the respective certifying physicians. The same names do not certify to each certificate, and the phraseology is not the same, in form, in each ease, and the fac similes are as different as the signatures of different individuals ordinarily are. Along the upper sides and ends of the lids of the boxes of each party is a narrow border, but that on appellants\u2019 box consists of small, alternate stripes of red and white\u2014the red stripes being, perhaps, four times broader than those of the white\u2014while the border on appellees\u2019 box is plain red.</p> <p id=\"b146-4\" pgmap=\"146\">It is thus apparent that in respect to the tops as well as to the ends of the boxes the difference can be detected by even casual observation, as far as one box of this size and shape can, by the use of dissimilar labels, be distinguished from another.</p> <p id=\"b146-5\" pgmap=\"146(319) 147(23)\">With respect to the circulars in each box, there is a palpable distinction, obvious to any one, even without reading. The display letters in the head lines are entirely different in shape, shading and size, and the paper in appellants\u2019 box is shorter and narrower than that in appellees\u2019 box, and there is a difference in the quality and whiteness of the paper, and in the form, shading and size of the letters in the body of the circulars, plainly distinguishable as far as the outlines of the letters are visible. At the head of appellants\u2019, in large caps, is the word \u201cBall\u2019s. \u201d At the bead of appellees\u2019, also in large caps, are the words, \u201cDr. Schilling\u2019s.\u201d One circular commends \u201cBall\u2019s\u201d corset, and the other commends that of \u201cDr. Schilling. \u201d It is true that in cases of this kind, as a general rule, exact similitude is not required to constitute an infringement, or to entitle the complaining party to protection ; but if the form, marks, contents, words, or other special arrangement or general appearance of the words of the alleged infringer\u2019s device, are such as would be likely to mislead persons in the ordinary course of purchasing the goods, and induce them to suppose that they were purchasing the genuine article, then the similitude is such as entitles the injured party to equitable protection, if he takes seasonable measures to assert his rights and prevent their continued invasion. (Thompson\u2019s note to Popham v. Cole, 23 Am. Rep. 28.) But the court is not bound to interfere where ordinary attention will enable purchasers to discriminate between the trade marks used by different parties. Popham v. Cole, 66 N. Y. 69; 23 Am. Rep. 22, and eases there cited; Morgan\u2019s Sons Co. v. Troxell, 89 N. Y. 292; 42 Am. Rep. 294; Manufacturing Co. v. Francis, supra; Reed v. Richardson, 45 L. T. (N. S.) 54; Beard v.

Ch. 101; High on Injunctions, (1st ed.) sec. 676; Hilliard on Injunctions, p. 407, sec. 43.
