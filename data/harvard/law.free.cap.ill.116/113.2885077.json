Vendor\u2019s lien\u2014principle on which, lien rests. The principle governing courts of equity in the enforcement of liens, is the implied agreement held to exist between the vendor and vendee that the former shall hold a lien on the lands sold, for the payment of the purchase price, on the ground that the person who has the estate ought not, in conscience, as between them, keep it and not pay the purchase money.</syllabus><syllabus data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b113-9\" pgmap=\"113\">2. Same\u2014waiver by talcing other security. If a vendor of real estate takes collateral and independent security for the purchase money, he thereby releases and waives all right to a vendor\u2019s lien.</syllabus><syllabus data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b113-10\" pgmap=\"113\">3. Same\u2014what to be regarded as collateral security\u2014and herein, who to be considered the real purchaser. A person purchased a tract of land for himself, for which he agreed to pay by a stock of goods valued at $4000 and the conveyance of town lots valued at $1000, and had the land so purchased by him conveyed to his two sons in trust for himself, they paying nothing, and delivered the goods, but was unable to convey the lots for want of title thereto. The sons afterward, at the father\u2019s request, conveyed the land to a third person, who paid nothing therefor, but held the title for the father: Held, that the vendor of the land had a vendor\u2019s lien upon the lands conveyed by him, to the extent of $1000, the amount of the unpaid purchase money, which he might enforce as against the sons and their voluntary grantee.</syllabus><syllabus data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b113-11\" pgmap=\"113\">4. If land is bought by one as the agent of another, and a conveyance is made to the principal, the real purchaser, and the vendor accepts the obligation of the agent for the unpaid purchase money, he will waive his lien as vendor. But this rule has no application to a case where the purchase is made by a party for himself, and the deed is made to one in trust for his use. In such case he is the real purchaser, and his obligation to pay for the same is not collateral security.</syllabus><syllabus data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b113-12\" pgmap=\"113\">5. Where the equitable Owner- of land, the legal title being in another, sells the same, and procures a conveyance from the holder of the legal title to be made to a third person in trust for the purchaser, a court of equity will regard the equitable owner as the vendor, and he may enforce a vendor\u2019s lien for the unpaid purchase money against the land so conveyed. In such case the person-for whose use the land is conveyed will be held to be the real purchaser.</syllabus><syllabus data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b114-4\" pgmap=\"114\">6. Same\u2014as against mere volunteers and pun-chasers with notice. A conveyance of land by the purchaser to a third person, with notice of the existence of a vendor\u2019s lien, or to a mere volunteer, will not defeat the enforcement of the lien.</syllabus><syllabus data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b114-5\" pgmap=\"114\">7.

Franklin Blades, Judge, presiding.</summary><summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b114-8\" pgmap=\"114(193) 115(256)\">On the 15th day of March, 1878, Thomas Beal claimed and represented to appellees that he was the owner of certain lots-in Castle\u2019s addition to the village of Wyoming, Stark county, Illinois, and also of a stock of goods then in a store occupied by him. At that time the complainants (appellees) were the owners of certain real estate, although the legal title was in one Edward B. Hurlbut. Thomas Beal induced appellees te enter into a contract with him, whereby said Beal agreed to-sell and deliver said stock of goods and convey said village lots, in Wyoming to appellees in fee, clear of incumbrance. The-trade was consummated,\u2014the price of the goods as agreed upon was $4000, and the village lots $1000. In consideration of the sale and conveyance of said lots and stock of goods, appellees agreed with said Thomas Beal to cause to be conveyed to Alsina and Frederick Beal, sons of Thomas Beal, the said lands owned by appellees, the legal title of which was in said Hurlbut, subject to an incumbrance of $2400, The appellees reserved the right to pay off and remove all other incumbrances on said land within four months, which they in fact did. Appellees, in pursuance of said contract, caused a deed for the real estate so vested in said Hurlbut to be executed by said Hurlbut to said Alsina and Frederick Beal, and delivered to Thomas Beal. The stock of goods was duly delivered to appellees, but the lots in Wyoming were not conveyed to appellees, said Thomas Beal at the time of the contract, or since, not being the owner or having any interest therein, and at no time since the contract has it been in his power to convey the title. Immediately upon the delivery of the deed from Hurlbut, Thomas Beal went into possession of the land thereby conveyed, and has had ever since the full and absolute control of said land; and on the 1st day of January, 1878, said Alsina and Frederick Beal, at the request of said Thomas Beal, conveyed said real estate to one L. M. Johnson, for the purpose of enabling said Thomas Beal to borrow money thereon to pay his debts. Johnson paid nothing for such conveyance, and neither he nor the said Alsina or Frederick over-bad any interest in said real estate, but the title was at all times held by them in trust for Thomas Beal. Alsina and Frederick were young men, clerks in their father\u2019s store, without means, and the title to the real estate was placed in them, as said Thomas alleged, to enable him to settle with his creditors.</summary><summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b115-5\" pgmap=\"115(114) 116(268)\">Appellees filed a bill setting forth the above facts, and making Thomas Beal, Alsina Beal, Frederick Beal and Lyman M. Joknson, defendants, and praying to have a vendor\u2019s lien enforced to the extent of $1000, the stipulated price of said village lots, against the lands so conveyed to said Alsina and Frederick for said Thomas Beal. On the same day a summons issued, returnable to the first Monday in February, 1879. On the 24th day of December, 1878, the summons was duly returned served on Johnson, but not found as to the other-defendants. There appears in the record at the February special term, A. D. 1882, of the circuit court of Iroquois county, wherein said cause was pending, the following: \u201cAnd now come the defendants, by Robert Doyle, their attorney, and file a demurrer to the bill of complaint in this cause.\u201d This demurrer, which appears by the record to have been sustained, is not set out in the record here filed. On March 5, 1884, the following entry appears in said circuit court record: \u201cAnd now comes the complainants, by J. W. Holland, their solicitor, and the defendants, by Robert Doyle, their solicitor, and the demurrer to the bill heretofore filed herein coming on to be heard, and the court being fully advised in relation thereto, ordered that the said demurrer be sustained; whereupon, on motion of the complainants\u2019 solicitor, leave is given to amend the bill by to-morrow morning.\u201d On the 28th day of March, 1884, Alsina Beal and L. M. Johnson filed their demurrer to the amended bill, which. wras overruled by the court, and they electing to abide by their \u25a0 demurrer, the bill was taken as, confessed against all the defendants, and a decree rendered granting the relief prayed for. From that decree the defendants prayed, and were allowed, an appeal to the Appellate Court, but Thomas Beal alone perfected the appeal. The decree of the circuit court was affirmed in the Appellate Court, and appellant, Thomas Beal, now brings the record here and asks a reversal of the judgment of the Appellate Court. Errors are assigned by Thomas Beal, Frederick Beal and Alsina Beal, whilst Thomas Beal is the sole appellant, Frederick and Alsina Beal not having perfected their appeal.</summary><attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b116-7\" pgmap=\"116\">Messrs.

They knew they were relying on the obligation of a person other than the grantees in the deed, for the delivery of the goods and the conveyance of the lots, and thus it becomes an independent security and waives the lien.

This raises the same questions, practically, as the fourth assignment of error, and will be considered in connection therewith.</p> <p id=\"b119-8\" pgmap=\"119\">The second error assigned is, that the circuit court erred in rendering a money decree against Frederick and Alsina Beal. A sufficient answer to this objection is, that they are not before this court, and can not assign errors for themselves; and even if it be conceded that the decree is erroneous in the respect urged, it is in no way prejudicial to the appellant, and he can not assign for error matters appearing in the record relating in nowise to himself, but to other defendants, and which do not affect his rights. Fonville v. Sausser, 73 Ill. 451; Walker v. Abt, 83 id. 226; Kennedy v. Kennedy, 66 id. 190; Greenman v. Harvey, 53 id. 386; Havighorst v. Lindberg, 67 id. 463; Morse v. Smith, 83 id. 396; Smith v. Hickman, 68 id. 314.</p> <p id=\"b119-9\" pgmap=\"119(97) 120(166)\">The third assignment of error is, that the circuit court had no jurisdiction of the person of Thomas Beal. As we have seen, the summons was returned not served as to Thomas Beal, but it is recited in the record that the defendants interposed a demurrer to the original bill, which was sustained, and leave given complainants to amend. It is also recited that the defendants, by their attorney, came, etc., upon consideration of the demurrer. This demurrer, as already said, is not set out in the record, so that we can see whether all the defendants joined in it or not. The record is brought into the Appellate Court and this court by the appellant, Thomas Beal, and he has seen fit to rest the ease upon the recitals in the record of the circuit court. No suggestion of a diminution of the record is made, or an attempt to supply the demurrer, which, if produced, would at once show whether he joined in it or not. We think that where the record of the circuit court contains recitals that certain papers were filed by the-defendants, and one of the defendants brings the case to this court without incorporating in the record the papers so purporting by the recitals to have been filed by him, the presumption should be indulged that the paper, if produced, would sustain the recitals in the record. There is no hardship in this rule. We therefore hold that the recitals in this record are sufficient to show an appearance of all the defendants.</p> <p id=\"b120-5\" pgmap=\"120\">The fourth and last error assigned is, that the bill failed to show such a state of facts as entitled complainants to a decree for a vendor\u2019s lien. This presents the same question as the first assignment, and is the real matter of controversy in the case.</p> <p id=\"b120-6\" pgmap=\"120(148) 121(104)\">It is contended by counsel for appellant, that when a vendor of real estate takes collateral and independent security for the purchase money, he thereby releases or waives all right to a vendor\u2019s lien, and numerous authorities are cited to support the position. This principle is undoubtedly correct, and if it is applicable here, is conclusive of the case. But does it apply to the facts of this case ? What collateral or independent security did the vendors take ? It is claimed that they conveyed, or caused to be conveyed, to Alsina and Frederick Beal, the land against w'hich a vendor\u2019s lien is now claimed, and took the promise of Thomas Beal to convey other property to them in payment therefor, and that amounted to a collateral security, or a security independent of the land conveyed, and, therefore, a waiver of their vendor\u2019s lien. This is a misapprehension of the fact. The sale was made to Thomas Beal for a certain consideration, $1000 of which was to be paid by the conveyance of the lots in the village of Wyoming. When the deed was made, it was to his two sons, by his direction and for his convenience, but delivered to him, on liis obligation to pay for the same according to the contract, by delivering the stock of goods and conveying said village lots. The sons took the title simply in trust for then-father, and as mere volunteers, having no pecuniary or personal interest therein.</p> <p id=\"b121-5\" pgmap=\"121(275) 122(61)\">It is said by appellant\u2019s counsel, that the case of Andrus v. Coleman, 82 Ill. 26, is a parallel case with this. We think there is a marked distinction between this case and that one, as well as all other cases cited by appellant\u2019s counsel. In that case, Andrus conveyed to Martha J. Coleman the land and took her husband\u2019s deed of conveyance for certain lands, in Kansas, and his note for the balance of the purchase price of the land sold the wife. The court, in passing upon that case, say: \u201cWe consider that appellant, having conveyed to appellee, is estopped from questioning her title. He did this knowingly and voluntarily, and it is too late now to say that the title, in fact, belonged to her husband, with whom he .contracted. This is ample recognition of his knowledge of the husband being the agent for the wife in the transaction, as she swears he was; and, therefore, when he accepted his covenant of warranty for the Kansas lands, and his individual note for the residue of the purchase money, he knew that he was relying on the obligation of a person other than his grantee for the payment of the purchase money. \u201d In this case, the sale was made to Thomas Beal by appellees. The relation of purchaser and seller existed between them, and them alone. True, the deed was made to the sons of Thomas, but it is not claimed or pretended that they were purchasers in fact, or claimed to have any interest in the land or participated in the transaction in any way, except to receive the title in trust for their father. Nor is it shown or pretended that the vendors (appellees) claimed that any person other than Thomas Beal became liable to them for any portion of the purchase price of the land. It will be conceded that as between Thomas Beal and his sons, he was the equitable owner of the land conveyed by Hurlbut.</p> <p id=\"b122-4\" pgmap=\"122\">It is also contended that appellees can not enforce a vend- or\u2019s lien, because the legal title was in Hurlbut, and the conveyance made from him to the grantees in the deed. Hurlbut was not the vendor or seller. As we have seen, appellees were the owners, in fact, of the land,\u2014were, in fact, the vendors to Thomas Beal, and the conveyance by Hurlbut was made by him on their order and request, and to prevent the necessity of a conveyance to them, and from them to appellant or his sons. It is a familiar rule that equity disregards mere forms, and looks to the substance in the application of equitable principles, and this is especially so in the enforcement of vendor\u2019s liens.</p> <p id=\"b122-5\" pgmap=\"122(194) 123(213)\">In Carey v. Boyles et al. 53 Wis. 574, it was held, where A purchased a tract of land for B, taking the deed to B, who agreed to repay A the purchase price, that, in equity, A and B stood in the relation of vendor and purchaser, and the former had a vendor\u2019s lien for the unpaid purchase money. In this ease, if the real parties chose to consummate the trade by taking a deed directly from Hurlbut, and to sons of the purchaser, it should not follow that the equitable right to enforce the vendor\u2019s lien is thereby lost. The principle that will govern courts of equity in the enforcement of vendors\u2019 liens, is the implied agreement held to exist between the \u2022vendor and vendee that the former shall hold a lien on the lands sold, for the payment of the purchase price, on the ground that a person who has the estate of another ought not, in conscience, as between them, keep it and not pay the purchase money. (2 Story\u2019s Eq. Jur. secs. 1219-1224.) Usually lien is given to the grantor in the deed who is the vendor as well, but, as we have said, the substance is to be regarded, and the useless form of a conveyance by Hurlbut to appellees, that they might convey to appellant, will not be necessary to preserve, in equity, the right to enforce this lien. If Hurlbut had conveyed to appellees, and they to appellant, under this contract, and appellant, even for consideration, had conveyed to his sons, with notice, and they to Johnson, with notice of appellees\u2019 rights, can it be questioned that the right to enforce the lien would exist ? Here appellees were the equitable owners of the land, controlled the legal title, caused the \u25a0conveyance to be made, and are entitled to the purchase money, and we can conceive of no principle of equity that will defeat their right to enforce a lien therefor against this land in the hands of mere volunteers, in whose hands the land, for all equitable purposes and considerations, must be treated as belonging to Thomas Beal. Neither appellant nor appellees are strangers or third parties to this transaction. Loomis et al. v. Davenport and St. Paul Railroad Co. 3 McCrary, U. S. Ct. Court, 489; Austin v. Underwood, 37 Ill. 438 ; Magee v. Magee, 51 id. 500; Carey v. Boyles, supra.</p> <p id=\"b123-5\" pgmap=\"123\">We are of opinion that a vendor\u2019s lien existed in favor of appellees for the price of the lots agreed to be conveyed by appellant as part, of the consideration for the sale of the land to him, and that there has been no waiver of it. We think the conclusion reached is fully sustained by authority, as well as the reason of the rule.</p> <p id=\"b123-6\" pgmap=\"123\">Finding no error in this record, the judgment of the Appellate Court will be affirmed.</p> <p id=\"b123-7\" pgmap=\"123\">Judgment affirmed.</p> <p id=\"b123-8\" pgmap=\"123\">The record in this cause was originally assigned to Mr. justice Dickey, and no opinion having been prepared by him, it was re-assigned in November, 1885.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
