That hearsay was prior testimony from several students, given under oath and subject to cross-examination in a criminal trial. We conclude that, under the circumstances, the testimony satisfied the standard of reliability for evidence in an administrative proceeding and that substantial evidence supported the commission\u2019s order. We reject, without discussion, the fourth assignment of error, challenging the choice of sanction. Consequently, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">We review for substantial evidence in the record, ORS 183.482(8)(c), but \u201cwe do \u2018not substitute [our] judgment for that of the agency as to any issue of fact or agency discretion.\u2019\u201d <em>Day v. Elections Division, </em>246 Or App 140, 145, 265 P3d 16 (2011) (quoting ORS 183.482(7)). We state the facts in a manner consistent with the agency\u2019s unchallenged factual findings and the uncontroverted evidence in the record.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">Petitioner is a native of Mexico who had taught high school students there for about five years. He testified that he often touched students in encouragement or in ways that were the social norm in Latino culture.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-7\">Petitioner moved to the United States in 1990. In school year 2006-07, he worked as an educational assistant at Lane Middle School for the Portland Public Schools. During that time, a female student complained to the administration after he touched her arm. The classroom supervisor cautioned him not to touch a student like he had done.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-8\">In 2008, petitioner received an Oregon teaching license. The North Clackamas School District (district) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>hired him to tutor, to help students in its English as a second language (ESL) program, and to teach bilingual math and science. The school year began with a week of in-service orientation that teachers were required to attend. The orientation included a session on sexual harassment, and teachers received a copy of the district policy on sexual harassment, and the TSPC pamphlet, \"The Ethical Educator &amp; Professional Practices.\u201d The district\u2019s risk manager advised teachers, \u201cDo not hug students. Do not touch students.\u201d The following school year began with a similar orientation and a session on sexual harassment.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-3\">During the 2008-09 school year, S was 16 years old and a teacher\u2019s assistant in petitioner\u2019s ESL algebra class at Milwaukee High School. Several times, he put his hand on her thigh as he knelt to give her instructions or as he stood up. She was uncomfortable about the contact. In fall of 2009, in the next school year, petitioner put his hand on her thigh and knee in the same way on several occasions. During that fall, on two to four occasions, petitioner massaged S\u2019s neck and shoulders with his hands, when she was seated. She would later report that, when he moved his hands down the front of her chest toward the top of her breasts, she said she did not want a massage and turned away.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-4\">In October 2009, M, then about 15 years old, began attending petitioner\u2019s tutoring class. She was uncomfortable when petitioner placed his hand on her thigh and knee when he knelt down to help her with school work. In November, she told Aguilar, a school counselor, that she was uncomfortable in petitioner\u2019s class, but she did not mention petitioner touching her thigh. Near Thanksgiving, M mentioned to petitioner that she had a sore neck, but she did not ask for a massage. She later reported that, when standing behind her, he began massaging her neck and shoulders and moved his hands down to the top area between her breasts. She pulled away, he stopped, and she left.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">Just after Thanksgiving, S and M went to Aguilar. M told the counselor about petitioner touching her thigh and knee. Aguilar heard her voice quivering and saw tears in her eyes. On December 3, vice principal Busch spoke to M, heard the same account, and planned to start an investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>In the meantime, K, then about 16 years old, was in the ESL program and attended petitioner\u2019s math class about two days a week. On December 4, she moved her neck because it hurt. Although she did not ask, petitioner offered a massage. She later reported that he massaged her neck and shoulders, then moved his hands down to the top of her breasts and stopped. Petitioner asked for a hug, and she obliged. She said that, as she left the room, he smacked her buttocks with his hand. Disturbed, she went to a restroom and found her friend E. Together, they went to Hurd, the dean of students. Hurd saw that K was visibly upset. K recounted that petitioner had given her a massage of her neck and shoulders and touched the top of her breasts. Hurd took K to vice principal Busch, to whom K, then crying, gave the same account. Upon hearing K say the word \u201cbreast,\u201d Busch called the police immediately.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-4\">One of the responding officers, Detective Garrett, had been a resource officer in the school and had worked with petitioner on gang problems. Petitioner agreed to accompany the officers to the police station for an interview. He was not handcuffed or placed under arrest. At 2:29 p.m., the interview began and continued until 11:05 p.m. The officers told petitioner that the conversation was to be videotaped and that he was not under arrest. They advised him of his <em>Miranda </em>rights. Petitioner did much of the talking, at times joking or bantering with the officers. The officers provided petitioner with water, offered food, took rest breaks, and allowed him to call his family several times.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">Throughout most of the interview, petitioner denied making any inappropriate contact with the students. Later in the interview, petitioner demonstrated on an officer how he stood behind K and M, how he massaged their neck and shoulders, and how he moved his hands down the front of their chest to touch at least the top of their breasts. He said he massaged his students because he was \u201cattracted\u201d to them. He admitted that he touched both of M\u2019s breasts on the outside of her clothing and that he did so \u201cfor the attraction of it.\u201d He admitted that he felt K\u2019s breasts. He said it was a \u201cmistake,\u201d and he \u201cwas stupid.\u201d He said that he may have \u201cswatted [K\u2019s] butt.\u201d He said that he \u201cneeded help.\u201d He <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>wanted \u201cchange,\u201d and he needed \u201ctherapy.\u201d Soon after, when speaking to his son, petitioner recanted his admissions and described the accusations as false.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-3\">Because the police had begun a criminal investigation, the school district did not pursue an independent investigation of its own. In March 2010, the district notified petitioner that his employment would soon be terminated and that his teaching contract would not be renewed. Petitioner filed a grievance under his collective bargaining agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-4\">In November 2010, petitioner was tried on criminal charges of third degree sexual abuse and attempted third degree sexual abuse. ORS 163.415 (third degree sexual abuse); ORS 161.405(1) (attempt).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The complaining witnesses, S, M, and K, all testified and were cross-examined by petitioner\u2019s defense attorney. In the defense case, petitioner\u2019s predecessor Battson, testified that S was not a truthful person. The defense also offered testimony of other students who testified that S was not truthful, that the complaining witnesses were friends, and that S had said she could get rid of petitioner.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The court instructed the jury that the state must prove beyond a reasonable doubt, among other things, that petitioner had touched a sexual or other intimate part of a person for the purpose of arousing or gratifying sexual desire. The jury found petitioner not guilty of all charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-5\">After the criminal trial, petitioner\u2019s labor grievance proceeded to an arbitration hearing held in May, June, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>September 2011.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The arbitrator required the district to prove its case by clear and convincing evidence. Petitioner admitted massaging shoulders and touching thighs, but he denied touching the students\u2019 breasts or K\u2019s buttocks. In February 2012, the arbitrator found that there was not clear and convincing evidence to believe that the more offensive contact occurred, or to believe petitioner\u2019s confession to the police. The arbitrator concluded that the district had not proven just cause to terminate petitioner. Alternatively, the arbitrator concluded that, if petitioner had done all of which he was accused, the district still lacked just cause because it failed to conduct its own investigation, and because the district failed to use progressive discipline.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-3\">In September 2012, the TSPC issued a notice accusing petitioner of gross neglect of duty in violation of ORS 342.175(l)(b) and violations of related administrative rules, noted below, all involving the accusations of the complaining students. In September 2013, an administrative law judge (ALJ) conducted a contested-case hearing on behalf of the TSPC. Although both petitioner and TSPC listed the complaining students as witnesses, neither party called the students to testify at the hearing. Instead, both petitioner and the TSPC offered, as an exhibit, excerpts of the transcripts of the testimony of those students and others who testified in the criminal trial. Petitioner did not object to the admissibility of testimony of S, M, and K. Rather, petitioner offered their prior trial testimony and the prior testimony of other trial witnesses in order to attempt to discredit the complaining students.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-4\">As in the criminal trial, petitioner testified that he innocently massaged the shoulders of two students and that he touched their thighs to steady himself when kneeling or standing. He characterized the other accusations as the product of a vendetta of S and her friends M and K. He portrayed their motives as resentment because he was a strict <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>teacher or as the students\u2019 desire for favorable immigration treatment, given to victims of sexual abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-3\">The ALJ issued a 36-page proposed order, reviewing the evidence and sustaining some, but not all, of the charges of professional misconduct. The ALJ admitted without objection the criminal trial transcript offered by both parties, as well as the video recordings of the police interview of petitioner.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The ALJ noted that his determination of the charges would be made based upon a preponderance of the evidence, rather than the higher standards of proof in the criminal or labor proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-4\">In findings of fact, the ALJ stated, \u201cI conclude that [petitioner\u2019s] admissions to the police that he touched the breasts of [K] and [M] was truthful and believable. His confession corroborated their detailed testimony that he touched their breasts.\u201d The ALJ observed that the interview was lengthy, but police did not physically threaten, were not verbally abusive, and did not act in an intimidating way. The ALJ noted that petitioner \u201cvoluntarily demonstrated on a police officer how he massaged the female students\u2019 neck and shoulder area, and how he ended up touching at least the top part of the students\u2019 breasts with his hands.\u201d To the ALJ, the demonstration and the admission of \u201cattraction,\u201d \u201cnegate [d] any claim that he finally \u2018threw in the towel\u2019 to \u2018police coercion\u2019 * * * in order to end the questioning.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">Accordingly, the ALJ accepted the accounts of petitioner\u2019s touching of S, M, and K as detailed in their criminal trial testimony and in their statements to school officials. They all testified that the contact made them feel uncomfortable, and they had reported the touching to school authorities and police. The ALJ found that \u201cmore likely than not, [petitioner] intentionally touched the breasts of female students.\u201d \u201cWhether [petitioner] touched the full front of the breasts, touched the top of the breasts, or touched between the breasts,\u201d the ALJ reasoned, \u201cis not important to determine whether his conduct constituted gross neglect of duty \u215c * * \u00bb</p>\n<p id=\"b289-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>The ALJ concluded, first, that petitioner committed gross neglect of duty that was a substantial deviation from professional standards of judgment in violation of OAR 584-020-0040(4)(n) and OAR 584-020-0010(5).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The ALJ concluded next that petitioner committed gross neglect of duty by failing to honor appropriate adult boundaries with students in conduct and conversations in violation of OAR 584-020-0040(4)(o) and OAR 584-020-0035(1)(c)(D).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The ALJ concluded, finally, that petitioner committed gross neglect of duty by engaging in sexual conduct with a student in violation of OAR 584-020-0040 (4)(f).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Because petitioner\u2019s license had lapsed, the ALJ recommended that TSPC revoke his privilege to reapply for a license or registration.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-3\">Petitioner took exception to the ALJ\u2019s findings and conclusions. The TSPC did not find the exceptions persuasive. The TSPC adopted the ALJ\u2019s findings and conclusions as written, and the commission imposed a sanction specifying that petitioner\u2019s privilege to apply for a license was revoked for one year.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-4\">On review before this court, petitioner assigns error in terms of a failure of substantial evidence, primarily based on the commission\u2019s reliance on hearsay to resolve the critical part of the dispute.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> He argues that the ALJ was unable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>to observe the demeanor of the complaining witnesses, that his confession was coerced, and that, after such evidence is disregarded, no substantial evidence remains upon which a reasonable person could reach the commission\u2019s conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-3\">We begin by rejecting petitioner\u2019s suggestion that we summarily disregard the evidence unfavorable to him. Although petitioner contends that his admissions to the police were coerced, the ALJ found otherwise based on substantial evidence. <em>See </em>ORS 183.482(8)(c) (\u201cSubstantial evidence exists to support a finding of fact when the record, viewed as a whole, would permit a reasonable person to make that finding.\u201d). The ALJ had the video recording of the lengthy interview. Based on that evidence, the ALJ found that the officers did not physically threaten petitioner, were not verbally abusive, were not intimidating, and did not threaten him if he did not confess. The ALJ found that petitioner\u2019s demonstration of a massage and his admissions of \u201cattraction\u201d negated any argument about police coercion.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-4\">Petitioner\u2019s own admissions, offered against him, were not hearsay. OEC 801(4)(b)(A). Those admissions are evidence, among other evidence, on which the ALJ could choose to rely. Although petitioner prefers the labor arbitrator\u2019s conclusion about a false confession or the jury\u2019s verdict of not guilty, petitioner offers no legal authority that requires the ALJ to reach the same conclusion, nor are we aware of any, particularly as among different decision-makers freighted with additional issues and employing different standards of proof. Exercising his own judgment, the ALJ made a permissible finding of fact about petitioner\u2019s admissions when he found the admissions were \u201ctruthful and believable.\u201d Generally, we cannot substitute our judgment for an agency on a factual dispute. <em>Day, </em>246 Or App at 145. Accordingly, we cannot accept the suggestion to disregard petitioner\u2019s admissions.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">Similarly, we cannot disregard the testimony of the complaining students simply on the basis that they did not testify in the administrative hearing and did not provide the ALJ the opportunity to assess their demeanor. Credibility may be assessed in a variety of other ways, as well. We have recognized that \u201ccredibility depends not only on demeanor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>but also on such factors as inherent probability, or improbability of the testimony, the possible internal inconsistencies, the fact that it is or is not corroborated, that it is contradicted by other testimony or evidence and finally that human experience demonstrates it is logically incredible.\u201d <em>Preferred Funding, Inc. v. Jackson, </em>185 Or App 693, 699, 61 P3d 939 (2003) (internal quotation marks omitted). A large part of petitioner\u2019s challenge to the credibility of the complaining witnesses was based on alleged differences in their accounts at different times, testimony from one student and arguably a second student about the motives of S, and petitioner\u2019s own contrary testimony. Much of that sort of credibility assessment did not depend upon the ALJ\u2019s observation of demeanor of the complaining witnesses. As a result, the lack of opportunity to observe demeanor does not require us to summarily disregard that testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-3\">Nor does characterizing that testimony as hearsay require its immediate disregard. Although petitioner is correct that the students\u2019 prior testimony is hearsay within the meaning of OEC 801(3),<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> the evidence that an administrative body may consider in a contested case does not turn on the strictures of the Oregon Evidence Code as in a judicial proceeding. Instead, the Administrative Procedures Act provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-4\">\u201cIrrelevant, immaterial or unduly repetitious evidence shall be excluded but erroneous rulings on evidence shall not preclude agency action on the record unless shown to have substantially prejudiced the rights of a party. <em>All other evidence of a type commonly relied upon by reasonably prudent persons in conduct of their serious affairs shall be admissible. </em>Agencies and hearing officers shall give effect to the rules of privilege recognized by law. Objections to evidentiary offers may be made and shall be noted in the record. Any part of the evidence may be received in written form.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">ORS 183.450(1) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b292-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>In <em>Reguero v. Teacher Standards and Practices, </em>312 Or 402, 417, 822 P2d 1171 (1991), the Supreme Court observed, \u201cThe Oregon statutes governing evidence in administrative hearings reject the assumption that hearsay evidence is categorically so unreliable that it cannot be substantial. Hearsay evidence is as admissible under ORS 183.450(1) as any other evidence as long as it meets the statutory test of reliability.\u201d In that TSPC case, a former teacher urged that there should be at least a residuum of nonhearsay evidence to support a decision. <em>Id. </em>at 414. The Supreme Court, however, rejected the residuum rule and affirmed the holding of this court \u201cthat hearsay evidence alone, even if inadmissible in a civil or criminal trial, is not incapable of being \u2018substantial evidence\u2019 under ORS 183.482(8)(c).\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 417.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-3\">Thus, our task is to determine whether the students\u2019 testimony is the type of hearsay evidence that is sufficiently reliable to contribute to a conclusion that substantial evidence supported the TSPC order. In <em>Reguero, </em>the Supreme Court indicated that, given the variety of cases, \u201cvariable circumstances\u201d may be considered in assessing the \u201csub-stantiality\u201d of evidence when hearsay is involved. 312 Or at 418. The court borrowed from a treatise on administrative law to suggest a list of factors, which were illustrative, not exclusive. The court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-4\">\u201cThe \u2018substantial evidence\u2019 inquiry necessarily is case specific. Davis suggests, and we agree, that in assessing the substantiality of the evidence or lack of it, variable circumstances may be considered, <em>such as: </em>the alternative to relying on the hearsay evidence; the importance of the facts sought to be proved by the hearsay statements to the outcome of the proceeding and considerations of economy; the state of the supporting or opposing evidence, if any; the degree of lack of efficacy of cross-examination with respect to the particular hearsay statements; and the consequences of the decision either way.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">312 Or at 418 (citing 3 Davis, <em>Administrative Law Treatise </em>243 (2d 1980)) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">In <em>Reguero, </em>the TSPC denied a former teacher\u2019s application to reinstate his teaching license based on hearsay and double-hearsay statements that, while previously <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>teaching, he had sexual contact with two sixth-grade, female students. 312 Or at 405. There was no direct testimony by the students, no transcribed testimony, no sworn testimony, and no testimony subjected to cross-examination. <em>Id. </em>at 412. Instead, a deputy district attorney (DDA), a school counselor, and police officer retold what they had heard from two students. <em>Id. </em>at 426. The only incidental mention of sworn testimony was the DDA\u2019s recollection that when one of the students was before a grand jury, she did not remember a particular contact. <em>Id. </em>at 413. TSPC, not the former teacher, introduced the second-hand statements of the students. <em>Id. </em>at 405.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-4\">The Supreme Court noted first that live testimony would have provided an alternative to the unsworn, hearsay statements. <em>Id. </em>at 419. No one explained the students\u2019 absence, and the court assumed they were readily available. <em>Id. </em>at 414 n 16, 419. The court next noted that the TSPC decision was \u201cbased <em>entirely </em>on hearsay, particularly the hearsay testimony\u201d of the DDA, counselor, and officer. <em>Id. </em>at 419 (emphasis in original). The court next noted a list of TSPC findings contrary to the hearsay accounts, including that the accused teacher testified and denied any misconduct, that the students were friends, and one student\u2019s statement that she was \u201cgoing to get\u201d the accused teacher. <em>Id. </em>at 420-21. Finally, the court noted that the consequence of reliance on the hearsay was not minor because the order, denying the application, denied the ability of an individual to pursue a chosen profession. <em>Id. </em>at 421. With emphasis on the absence of sworn testimony subject to cross-examination, the court concluded that, taken as a whole, there was not substantial evidence to support the TSPC conclusions. <em>Id. </em>at 421-22.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">When compared with <em>Reguero, </em>this case has similarities and critical distinctions. Like <em>Reguero, </em>the alternative to hearsay would have been live testimony from the complaining witnesses. TSPC counsel did not explain why those students from the Portland area were not called as witnesses to the Salem hearing. In their absence, petitioner was entitled to put TSPC to its burden of proof. <em>Reguero, </em>312 Or at 418 n 22. On the other hand, petitioner did not object to the admission of that testimony and offered it himself. As a consequence, the agency was not alerted to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>the need to provide live testimony during one of the several days of extended hearings. Moreover, petitioner <em>could </em>have subpoenaed the complaining witnesses, particularly if their demeanor would reveal them to be unreliable. <em>See Day, </em>246 Or App at 146 (petitioners did not object to hearsay and could have subpoenaed the witnesses); <em>see also Petteys v. DMV, </em>195 Or App 644, 651, 98 P3d 1138 (2004) (petitioner could have subpoenaed witness, but failed to do so). As a result, the alternative to hearsay evidence does not significantly weigh in favor of petitioner. <em>Day, </em>246 Or App at 146 (first factor weighs in favor of neither party); <em>Petteys, </em>195 Or App at 651 (declining to give significant weight to first factor).</p>\n<p id=\"b294-3\">Like <em>Reguero, </em>\u201cthe facts sought to be proved by the hearsay\u201d were central to the proceeding. <em>Reguero, </em>312 Or at 418. Because this was a trial-type hearing over a number of days, rather than an expedited or routine administrative matter, considerations of economy or convenience did not provide an offsetting consideration.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b294-4\">Like <em>Reguero, </em>the gravity or consequence of the decision is much the same consideration. In that case, the consequence of reliance on the hearsay was denial of an application for a license, and the court treated that denial as having \u201ca profound impact on * * * the ability of an individual to pursue a chosen profession.\u201d 312 Or at 421. In that case, like this case, the sanction was the equivalent of a year\u2019s suspension before reapplying for a license.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> As a result, the \u201cconsequences\u201d consideration favors petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">Unlike <em>Reguero, </em>the state of supporting or opposing evidence leads to a much different assessment here. We do, of course, recognize similarly opposing evidence. Like <em>Reguero, </em>in this case, there was another student, Y, who testified S had said that S wanted \u201cto get rid\u201d of petitioner.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> And, like <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number><em>Reguero, </em>petitioner admitted innocent contacts and, at the hearing, resolutely denied sexual contacts. But, in this case, there was corroboration of the several accusing students in petitioner\u2019s admissions to the police, unlike <em>Reguero </em>where the hearsay evidence was the only evidence. As a result, the related-evidence consideration supports reliability.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-3\">This case is much different than <em>Reguero </em>when we consider an added factor present in the circumstances here: The students\u2019 statements are found in sworn testimony from a prior criminal case in which the students were cross-examined. That added factor is critical when assessing reliability, especially when we appreciate the reasons for the hearsay rule in the first place. As the Supreme Court has explained, \u201c [b] ecause hearsay statements, by definition, have been made out of court, they lack \u2018conventional indicia of reliability: they are usually not made under oath or other circumstances that impress the speaker with the solemnity of his statements; the declarant\u2019s word is not subject to cross-examination; and he is not available in order that his demeanor and credibility may be assessed by the jury.\u2019\u201d <em>State v. Cazares-Mendez/Reyes-Sanchez, </em>350 Or 491, 505, 256 P3d 104 (2011) (quoting <em>Chambers v. Mississippi, </em>410 US 284, 298, 93 S Ct 1038, 35 L Ed 2d 297 (1973); see <em>also State v. Kendrick, </em>239 Or 512, 515, 398 P2d 471 (1965) (\u201cThe ground for the exclusion of hearsay is that the opposing party has no opportunity to confront in court the person making the statement and test his veracity and accuracy by cross examination.\u201d (Citation omitted.)). In this case, apart from the ability of the decision maker to assess the demeanor of a live witness, the students\u2019 testimony presents neither of the reliability problems\u2014lack of an oath or opportunity for cross-examination\u2014that typically are present with hearsay.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-4\">In fact, for those reasons, the students\u2019 testimony in this case would have satisfied one of the hearsay exceptions of the Oregon Evidence Code, OEC 804(3)(a), if TSPC had demonstrated that the students were unavailable to testify. That exception provides that, where the declarant is unavailable, the hearsay rule does not exclude</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-5\">\u201c(a) Testimony given as a witness at another hearing of the same or a different proceeding, or in a deposition taken <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>in compliance with law in the course of the same or another proceeding, if the party against whom the testimony is now offered, or, in a civil action or proceeding a predecessor in interest, had an opportunity and similar motive to develop the testimony by direct, cross, or redirect examination.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b296-3\">OEC 804(3)(a). Rule 804 \u201cexpresses preferences: testimony given on the stand is preferred over hearsay, and hearsay, <em>if of the specified quality, </em>is preferred over complete loss of the evidence of the declarant.\u201d OEC 804 Commentary (1981) (emphasis added). The rule is premised on the view that, although not as reliable as live testimony, this type of hearsay is of sufficient \u201cquality\u201d to substitute when the declarant is not available.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-4\">Although we appreciate the importance of assessing the demeanor-credibility of live witnesses, generally, we are persuaded that the students\u2019 testimony, given under oath and subject to cross-examination, is nonetheless sufficiently trustworthy to be considered by the AL J. <em>See </em>282 Or App at 271-72 (the significance of the alternative to hearsay does not weigh heavily in favor of the petitioner). The significance of sworn testimony is explained in the legislative commentary to the Evidence Code addressing the rule that requires that witnesses must first declare by oath or affirmation that they will testify truthfully:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-5\">\u201cAs a means of discovering the truth, [OEC 603(1)] requires that every witness make an oath or affirmation before testifying. This is important in two respects. First, the making of a promise in a ceremonial setting may induce in the witness a feeling of special obligation to speak the truth. Second, the reference to divine and positive legal sanctions may impress upon the witness the possibility of punishment for perjury, to which the oath or affirmation is a prerequisite.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b296-6\">OEC 603.02 Commentary (1981); <em>see also State v. Staley, </em>165 Or App 395, 406-07, 995 P2d 1217 (2000) (discussing differing use of sworn and unsworn statements). The fact that, in this case, the critical testimony was sworn adds reliability to the testimony, because we must understand the oath to have more than ritualistic meaning. We have recognized that sworn statements bear the \u201cearmarks of reliability\u201d inasmuch as the affiants or witnesses subject themselves to the risk <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>of penalties for perjury or false swearing. <em>See, e.g., State v. Johnson, </em>221 Or App 394, 405, 190 P3d 455, <em>rev den, </em>345 Or 418 (2008) (allowing use of probation officer\u2019s affidavit in probation violation hearing); <em>see also </em>ORS 162.065 (perjury in sworn statement as Class C felony); ORS 162.075 (false swearing in sworn statement as a Class A misdemeanor).</p>\n<p id=\"b297-4\">Not only was the students\u2019 testimony sworn, it was transcribed. The transcript of their testimony avoided the common problems of hearsay implicit in memory or misinterpretation when one person retells what another person said. TSPC had for its consideration a professionally transcribed, word-for-word record of the testimony of S, M, and K in the criminal trial. Thus, the nature of the testimony, in the form of an accurate record, bolsters reliability.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">Finally, and perhaps most importantly, petitioner already had an opportunity to test the students\u2019 testimony through cross-examination\u2014a critical difference from <em>Reguero. </em>In the criminal case, all three complaining students were cross-examined by petitioner\u2019s defense attorney. The motivation to cross-examine was the same, if not greater, considering the criminal penalties petitioner faced at trial. In that trial, petitioner asserted the same defense, denying the accusations and arguing that the students were friends who conspired to accuse him falsely. On review, petitioner offers no plausible reason to have cross-examined differently in the criminal case than he would have done in the TSPC proceeding. As a result, the nature of the testimony, tested by cross-examination, strongly favors reliability.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-6\">For those reasons, we conclude that the testimony of the student witnesses, although hearsay, met the \u201cstatutory test of reliability\u201d under ORS 183.450(1). <em>See Day, </em>246 Or App at 150-51 (finding to be reliable challenged hearsay that was central to a violation of standards for obtaining signatures for an initiative). Viewing the record as a whole, we hold that substantial evidence permitted TSPC to make its findings of fact and reach its conclusions of law, revoking for one year petitioner\u2019s privilege to reapply for a teaching license.
