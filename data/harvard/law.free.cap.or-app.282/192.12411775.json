The hearing occurred on February 8, 2016, yet the parties and the trial court appeared to have adjudicated appellant\u2019s civil commitment\u2014as indicated by the trial court\u2019s order\u2014 under the previous version of the statute that defines a person with a mental illness. That is, the prior version of the statute, ORS 426.005(l)(e)(B) (2013), <em>amended by </em>Or Laws 2015, ch 461, \u00a7 1; Or Laws 2015, ch 433, \u00a7 1, defined a \u201cperson with mental illness\u201d as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-4\">\u201ca person who, because of a mental disorder, is * * * [u]nable to provide for basic personal needs and is not receiving such care as is necessary for health or safety.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">That statutory definition was amended by the legislature and became effective on January 1, 2016.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Or Laws 2015, ch 433, \u00a7 1. The current version of the statute, ORS 426.005(l)(f)(B), defines a \u201cperson with mental illness\u201d as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-6\">\u201ca person who, because of a mental disorder, is * * * [ujnable to provide for basic personal needs <em>that are necessary to avoid serious physical harm in the near future, </em>and is not receiving such care as is necessary <em>to avoid such harm\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b215-7\">(Emphases added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b215-8\">On appeal, appellant contends, and the state concedes, that the evidence was insufficient to support the trial court\u2019s determination. ORS 426.130(l)(a); <em>see State v. D. M., </em>245 Or App 466, 470, 263 P3d 1086 (2011) (\u201cIn order to civilly commit a person, the state must prove, by clear and convincing evidence, that the person is mentally ill.\u201d). Appellant\u2019s contention, however, relies on the 2013 version of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>the statute. The state\u2019s concession also relies on that version of the statute. Nevertheless, because neither party argues on appeal for the application of the current version of the statute, we too, analyze the sufficiency of the evidence under the pre-2016 statutory standard. Applying that standard, we agree with appellant that the state failed to prove with the requisite degree of proof that appellant was unable to provide for her basic needs because of her mental illness and accept the state\u2019s concession. Accordingly, we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-4\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b215-9\"> In 2015, ORS 426.005(l)(e) (2013)\u2014the paragraph defining the term \u201cperson with mental illness\u201d-\u2014was renumbered as ORS 426.005(l)(f).
