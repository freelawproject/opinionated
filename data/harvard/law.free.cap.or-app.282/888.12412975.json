J.</author>\n<p id=\"b911-3\">Defendant appeals an order denying his motion for forensic testing pursuant to ORS 138.692 (2007).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> ORS 138.697(1).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Specifically, defendant contends that, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"890\">*890</page-number>denying the motion, the trial court erroneously concluded that defendant had failed to \u201cpresent a prima facie showing that DNA testing of the specified evidence would, assuming exculpatory results, establish [his] actual innocence of * * * [t]he offense for which [he] was convicted.\u201d ORS 138.692 (l)(b)(A). For the reasons that follow, we conclude that defendant invited any purported error in that regard. <em>See, e.g., State v. Cervantes, </em>232 Or App 567, 577-78, 223 P3d 425 (2009); <em>State v. Kammeyer, </em>226 Or App 210, 214, 203 P3d 274, <em>rev den, </em>346 Or 590 (2009). Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-4\">The circumstances material to our consideration are straight-forward. In 2008, defendant was convicted following a jury trial of one count of first-degree rape, ORS 163.375, and one count of second-degree rape, ORS 163.365, of M, a child under the age of 14. In 2011, defendant filed a motion for forensic testing pursuant to ORS 138.692, with supporting affidavits by defendant, averring his actual innocence of the crimes of conviction, ORS 138.692(l)(a)(A)(i), and by defense counsel, pertaining to other statutory prerequisites, including description of the \u201ctheory of defense that the DNA testing would support,\u201d ORS 138.692(l)(a)(B), and the \u201cprima facie showing that DNA testing * * * would, assuming exculpatory results, establish\u201d defendant\u2019s \u201cactual innocence.\u201d ORS 138.692(l)(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b912-5\">Specifically, defendant\u2019s motion asserted that the state had collected, but never tested, M\u2019s underwear and sweatpants, which, by her account, she had worn immediately before and after the charged conduct, and requested that those articles of clothing be tested to determine \u201cif bod[ily] fluids are on them,\u201d and, if so, \u201cwhose bod[ily] fluids they are.\u201d The motion asserted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b912-6\">\u201cIf the complaining witnesses] story was truthful [,] her panties and/or her sweatpants should have her blood and/or defendant\u2019s semen or sperm on them. The absence of blood and/or semen/sperm will either disprove the complaining witnesses] trial testimony or [throw] the truthfulness of that testimony into doubt.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b912-7\">In defense counsel\u2019s affidavit, he reiterated the alleged significance of the requested testing, asserting that \u201ca complete absence of bodfily] fluids from defendant\u201d on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"891\">*891</page-number>items of clothing \u201cwould be highly probative evidence\u201d as contradicting M\u2019s account. As support for that contention, defense counsel referred to trial testimony by the examining pediatrician that, in cases involving tearing of the hymen, bleeding was \u201cexpected\u201d and in approximately 50 percent of cases involving sexual penetration, DNA evidence could be obtained from the victim\u2019s clothing. Thus, the specifically identified \u201ctheory of defense that the DNA testing would support,\u201d ORS 138.692(l)(a)(B), was that a complete absence of defendant\u2019s DNA, or of M\u2019s blood, on the items of clothing would demonstrate that the crimes of conviction had never occurred.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b913-3\">The state, in opposing the motion, contended only that defendant\u2019s submissions were legally insufficient in that they failed to satisfy ORS 138.692(l)(b). That is, the state\u2019s opposition focused solely on whether defendant had presented a \u201cprima facie showing\u201d that the requested testing \u201cwould, assuming exculpatory results, establish [defendant\u2019s] actual innocence.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b913-4\">The practical and legal premise of the state\u2019s position was that the prosecution had not relied on DNA evidence to secure defendant\u2019s convictions\u2014and, given the totality of evidence at trial, testing showing the absence of defendant\u2019s DNA or M\u2019s blood on the articles of clothing would not constitute <em>prima facie </em>evidence of \u201cactual innocence.\u201d In that regard, the state recounted the evidence at trial, including M\u2019s testimony that defendant had given her marijuana and alcohol and she had heard him put on a condom before penetrating her vagina, and testimony from the examining pediatrician that M had suffered traumatic vaginal injuries, most likely as a result of a sexual assault. Further, the state emphasized that the pediatrician, while acknowledging at trial the likelihood of bleeding, had also testified that it was not uncommon for a young victim with a recently torn hymen to have little or no noticeable bleeding and that DNA evidence was not available in half of all similar sexual assault cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"892\">*892</page-number>Significantly, in contending that defendant had not satisfied the \u201cprima facie showing\u201d requirement, the state identified the applicable standard of \u201cactual innocence\u201d as the one set forth in <em>Schlup v. Delo, </em>513 US 298, 329, 115 S Ct 851, 130 L Ed 2d 808 (1995): \u201cThe meaning of actual innocence * * * does not merely require a showing that a reasonable doubt exists in the light of the new evidence, <em>but rather that no reasonable juror would have found the defendant guilty\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b914-4\">Defendant submitted a reply memorandum. With respect to the applicable legal standard, defendant did not dispute the state\u2019s invocation of <em>Schlup, </em>but, instead, asserted that \u201cthe United [States] Supreme Court authority cited by the state *** support[s] defendant and do[es] not support the state.\u201d Further, in addressing the substantive content of \u201cactual innocence,\u201d defendant\u2019s reply identified <em>House v. Bell, </em>547 US 518, 126 S Ct 2064, 165 L Ed 2d 1 (2006), as instructive. Although the reply described the circumstances and disposition of <em>House, </em>it did not explicitly refer to the Court\u2019s reiteration and amplification of the <em>Schlup </em>formulation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b914-5\">\u201c[T]he <em>Schlup </em>standard does not require absolute certainty about the petitioner\u2019s guilt or innocence. A petitioner\u2019s burden at the gateway stage is to demonstrate that more likely than not, in light of the new evidence, no reasonable juror would find him guilty beyond a reasonable doubt\u2014or, to remove the double negative, that more likely than not any reasonable juror would have reasonable doubt.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b914-6\">547 US at 538.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b914-7\">So framed\u2014with the sole disputed issue being whether defendant\u2019s submissions presented a \u201cprima facie <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"893\">*893</page-number>showing\u201d of putative \u201cactual innocence,\u201d as required by ORS 138.692(l)(b)\u2014the matter proceeded to hearing. At the outset of that hearing, the trial court confirmed with defense counsel that the only issue was whether defendant had \u201cestablish [ed] a prima facie case of innocence.\u201d Defense counsel then, after stating that \u201cwe\u2019re in agreement that that term (\u201cactual innocence\u201d) is a term of art that has arisen out of federal habeas proceedings,\u201d immediately referred the court to <em>House </em>as elucidating the content of that \u201cterm of art.\u201d <em>House </em>was the only authority that defense counsel invoked during the hearing, and counsel never contended, by reference to the text or context of ORS 138.692 or related statutes, that \u201cactual innocence\u201d for purposes of the threshold \u201cprima facie showing\u201d under ORS 138.692(l)(b) imported and connoted a standard other than that expounded in <em>House </em>and <em>Schlup. </em>At one point during the brief hearing, the trial court confirmed defendant\u2019s reliance on <em>House </em>as amplifying the \u201cterm of art,\u201d and later, immediately before adjourning to take the matter under advisement, the court stated, \u201cI am going to review <em>House v. Bell\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b915-3\">The trial court subsequently denied the motion, concluding that defendant \u201chas not met his burden under ORS 138.692(l)(b)(A).\u201d That conclusion was explicitly predicated on the trial court\u2019s reliance on, and application of, the <em>Schlup/House </em>\u201cactual innocence\u201d formulation: The court concluded that it could not \u201csay that it is more probable than not that <em>no reasonable juror could vote to convict </em>if faced with the evidence Defendant hopes to obtain.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b915-4\">On appeal, defendant challenges that conclusion. That challenge proceeds from the premise that the trial court erred in applying the <em>Schlup/House </em>standard at the threshold \u201cprima facie showing\u201d stage of ORS 138.692\u2014 that is, that \u201c[t]he court incorrectly believed that defendant was required to show that no reasonable juror would convict him given the potential results of the DNA testing.\u201d Rather, defendant contends, \u201cthe statutory scheme requires only that a defendant demonstrate a reasonable possibility that the requested testing would result in exculpatory evidence, not that defendant would prevail on retrial armed with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"894\">*894</page-number>results.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We do not understand defendant to contend that if the <em>Schlup/House </em>standard applied to <em>prima facie </em>showings under ORS 138.692(l)(b), his submissions were sufficient to satisfy that standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-4\">The state remonstrates, <em>inter alia, </em>that any purported error by the trial court in relying on and applying the <em>Schlup/House </em>standard was invited by defendant, compelling affirmance. The state asserts, simply, that defendant \u201curged the court to rely on <em>House, </em>and now complains that it did just that\u201d\u2014and, thus, that defendant, having been \u201c\u2018actively instrumental in bringing about\u2019 [the] alleged error[,] \u2018cannot be heard to complaint.]\u2019\u201d <em>Kammeyer, </em>226 Or App at 214 (quoting <em>Anderson v. Oregon Railroad Co., </em>45 Or 211, 216-17, 77 P 119 (1904)).</p>\n<p id=\"b916-5\">We agree with the state. We preface our explanation by emphasizing the obvious: Our holding implies no view as to the requisite showing of \u201cactual innocence\u201d to satisfy the \u201cprima facie showing\u201d requirement of ORS 138.692 (l)(b). <em>Accord State v. Romero, </em>274 Or App 590, 599, 360 P3d 1275 (2015), <em>rev den, </em>358 Or 794 (2016) (\u201cThis case does not require us to establish what level of likelihood that the jury\u2019s assessment of reasonable doubt would change suffices for the required <em>prima facie </em>showing of actual innocence.\u201d). Rather, regardless of the merits of the trial court\u2019s reliance on, and application of, the <em>Schlup/House </em>standard, defendant\u2019s submissions and representations before the trial court preclude review of his appellate challenge.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-6\">Defendant, as the state asserts, was \u201cactively instrumental in bringing about\u201d the purported error. <em>Anderson, </em>45 Or at 216-17. To be sure, as noted above, 282 Or App at 892, the state invoked <em>Schlup </em>first. However, thereafter in his reply memorandum, defendant not only embraced <em>Schlup, </em>arguing that it supported his position, but also invoked <em>House </em>for the first time as being instructive as \u201csimilar <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"895\">*895</page-number>* * * in that DNA testing would not provide conclusive proof that the petitioner was actually innocent.\u201d Thereafter, at the hearing, defense counsel reiterated defendant\u2019s reliance on <em>House. </em>All of those references occurred in the context in which the <em>only </em>disputed matter was the (in) adequacy of defendant\u2019s putative <em>prima facie </em>showing of \u201cactual innocence.\u201d Defense counsel, having brought <em>House </em>to the trial court\u2019s attention and having repeatedly invoked it as elucidating \u201cactual innocence\u201d for purposes of assessing the sufficiency of his proffered <em>prima facie </em>submission, never suggested\u2014not even when the court, in taking the matter under advisement, stated that it was \u201cgoing to review <em>House v. </em>Bell\u201d\u2014that the term, as used in ORS 138.692(l)(b), might have some different, structurally or contextually informed content.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-3\">This was quintessential invited error. Neither the fact that the alleged error pertained to statutory construction nor that the state contributed to the purported error, by way of its initial citation of <em>Schlup, </em>alters that conclusion. <em>See State v. Hardesty, </em>238 Or App 146, 151, 241 P3d 741 (2010), <em>rev den, </em>349 Or 654 (2011) (where \u201c[b]oth parties proceeded under a common understanding of the statutory requirements, [which] may or may not have been correct,\u201d the appellant defendant could not \u201cnow complain that the trial court erred because it failed to view the statute differently than presented by the parties\u201d); <em>Cervantes, </em>232 Or App at 577-78 (noting that neither <em>Miller v. Water Wonderland Improvement District, </em>326 Or 306, 951 P2d 720 (1998), nor <em>Stull v. Hoke, </em>326 Or 72, 948 P2d 722 (1997), \u201cabrogate[s] a century of case law [or] eliminate [s] the prudential doctrine that a party that invites an error may not obtain a reversal on appeal based on that error,\u201d and concluding that, \u201c[w]hen both parties urge a trial court to commit legal error in making a ruling, neither party is in a position to benefit from that invited error and obtain a reversal of the ruling on appeal\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b917-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b911-4\"> ORS 138.692 was amended in 2015. Or Laws 2015, ch 564, \u00a7 2. Because defendant sought, and the trial court denied, relief in 2011, those amendments are inapposite to our consideration. Consequently, all references to ORS 138.692 in this opinion are to the 2007 version of the statute, Or Laws 2007, ch 800, \u00a7 2, which was then extant. That iteration of the statute provided, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b911-5\">\u201c(l)(a) When a person files a motion under ORS 138.690 requesting the performance of DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) testing on specified evidence, the motion must he supported by an affidavit.
