(collectively defendants). Defendants filed a special motion to strike the third-party complaint under ORS 31.150, Oregon\u2019s anti-SLAPP<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> statute, and a separate motion to dismiss under ORCP 21 A(8). The trial court denied the special motion to strike, concluding that the claims alleged in the third-party complaint did not qualify for treatment under ORS 31.150. However, the trial court granted defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss under ORCP 21 A(8) based on its conclusion that Brill, a California attorney, was constrained under California law from using attorney-client privileged communications that were necessary to defendants\u2019 defense of the third-party complaint. Defendants appeal the trial court\u2019s denial of the special motion to strike, and plaintiffs appeal the trial court\u2019s grant of defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-5\">We conclude that the trial court did not err in denying the special motion to strike because plaintiffs\u2019 claims against defendants did not \u201carise out of\u2019 protected activity under ORS 31.150(2). However, we conclude that the trial court did err in granting defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss under ORCP 21 A(8). That is so because not all of the claims against defendants, on the face of the third-party complaint, implicate the attorney-client privilege as a barrier to defendants mounting a defense against those claims and, for the one claim that does\u2014a derivative legal malpractice claim\u2014 the trial court\u2019s dismissal was premature. Accordingly, we affirm on defendants\u2019- appeal (A154999), and we reverse and remand for further proceedings on plaintiffs\u2019 appeals (A155359, A155367).</p>\n<p id=\"b558-6\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b558-7\">On review from a motion to dismiss under ORCP 21 A(8), \u201cwe accept as true all well-pleaded allegations in the complaint and give plaintiff the benefit of all favorable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>inferences that may be drawn from the facts alleged.\u201d <em>Granewich v. Harding, </em>329 Or 47, 51, 985 P2d 788 (1999). On review from a special motion to strike, we take the facts from the complaint and also from the supporting and opposing affidavits, ORS 31.150(4), and view the facts in the light most favorable to the plaintiff. <em>Plotkin v. SAIF, </em>280 Or App 812, 815, 385 P3d 1167 (2016). With regard to the affidavits filed in connection with defendants\u2019 special motion to strike, we consider those additional facts only in the section of this opinion that analyzes the special motion to strike. Here, for purposes of background, we set forth the facts from plaintiffs\u2019 third-party complaint,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> which are relevant to our review of both the special motion to strike and the motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-4\">Plaintiffs, LaChapelle and Field, are shareholders in a company called Deep Photonics Corporation (DPC), which was incorporated in Delaware and headquartered in Oregon. DPC was formed in 2004 by LaChapelle and Ted Alekel to manufacture lasers and crystals that Alekel had developed that could be used in laser technology. Until the fall of2009, LaChapelle was the CEO and a director of DPC, and Field was employed by DPC to develop customers and markets for DPC\u2019s technology. Defendant Brill, an attorney licensed only in California, is DPC\u2019s general counsel and secretary. Brill is the majority shareholder of his law firm, defendant Enterprise Law Group. ELG Partners, an entity controlled by Enterprise Law Group, is a DPC shareholder. The other directors of DPC, who along with ELG Partners also make up the majority shareholders, are Alekel, Dong Kwan Kim, Bruce Juhola, and Roy Knoth.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-5\">In 2008, LaChapelle learned that Alekel\u2019s crystal technology could not be replicated in DPC\u2019s lab and, accordingly, initiated an investigation of Alekel\u2019s claimed research. LaChapelle then brought his concerns to the attention of Brill and the other directors. According to the third-party complaint,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>\u201cinstead of acting on the evidence LaChapelle presented and conducting a thorough investigation, the board instead hired a lawyer who, at Brill\u2019s direction, effectively papered over the alarming evidence LaChapelle had uncovered. The lawyer did this by conducting a sham investigation that was, in actuality, not an investigation at all. This was because Brill expressly instructed the lawyer not to interview the specific witnesses who had represented to LaChapelle that Alekel\u2019s claims about his research were false.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b560-4\">After receiving a report of the investigation Brill arranged, the board of directors took no further action with respect to the investigation, made Alekel president of DPC, and allocated new investment in Alekel\u2019s crystal. LaChapelle, however, developed and began implementing a plan to focus on manufacturing and marketing lasers that did not use Alekel\u2019s crystal.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-5\">In the fall of 2009, DPC terminated LaChapelle as CEO and as a director, terminated Field and other DPC employees, shut down its Oregon operations, and transferred assets and operations to Korea to be placed under Kim\u2019s, or his company\u2019s, control. LaChapelle and Field allege that this was accomplished through a conspiracy between the directors and Brill, and resulted in defendants obtaining significant financial and other benefits to the detriment of DPC. After those actions, LaChapelle and Field, who remained shareholders of DPC, received no information about DPC or its activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-6\">In 2011, DPC brought a complaint against, among others, LaChapelle and Field, seeking damages in the amount of $75 million, based primarily on claims that, in 2009, they had improperly removed or transferred the assets, intellectual property, and trade secrets of DPC to put to their own use. In turn, LaChapelle and Field brought, as plaintiffs, the third-party complaint that is the subject of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-7\">In the third-party complaint, plaintiffs brought derivative and individual claims against defendants Brill and Enterprise Law Group, and the directors of DPC, seeking $75 million in damages. As relevant on appeal, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>plaintiffs alleged in Count 2 of their derivative claim that Brill breached his fiduciary duty, along with the directors, by taking actions that enriched Kim\u2019s company and themselves at the expense of DPC, failing to take any effective action about the concerns with Alekel\u2019s crystal, deciding to fire LaChapelle and shut down the Oregon operations, making Alekel president and allocating new investment in his crystal, and approving DPC\u2019s lawsuit without understanding that DPC would be responsible for advancing defense costs of certain defendants pursuant to DPC\u2019s bylaws and Delaware law. Plaintiffs also alleged in Count 2 that defendants, as DPC corporate counsel, were also \u201cindependently negligent in failing to advise the company of its advancement obligations and/or the consequences of ignoring them.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b561-4\">In Count 3 of their derivative claim, plaintiffs alleged that defendants breached their fiduciary duty, as corporate counsel, and Brill, as DPC secretary, by</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-5\">\u201caffirmatively advis [ing] and assist [ing] in the conspiracy to fire LaChapelle and shut down the company\u2019s Oregon operations in order to transfer them to Korea, which according to [DPC\u2019s] own complaint, has resulted in the value of the company declining by $75 million!,] *** for substantially assisting, aiding, and abetting those directors in breaching their fiduciary duties, with knowledge that the directors\u2019 conduct was a breach of fiduciary duty[,] *** fail [ing] to advise the company to follow up in a thorough and professional manner on the evidence presented by LaChapelle concerning the integrity of Alekel\u2019s crystal!, and] *** committing] malpractice by approving DPC\u2019s filing of a $75 million lawsuit against multiple defendants without considering that DPC would be responsible for advancing the defense costs of certain defendants pursuant to DPC bylaws and applicable Delaware law[.]\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b561-7\">In his individual claim for breach of fiduciary duty, LaChapelle alleged that Enterprise Law Group, as one of the shareholders comprising the majority of DPC\u2019s shareholders, \u201cengaged in a course of oppressive conduct *** [including] to force LaChapelle from the company, freeze him out, and give his position and authority over to themselves for their own benefit, all of which resulted in the destruction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>of the company, as demonstrated by its current residence in bankruptcy.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b562-3\">Defendants filed both a special motion to strike the third-party complaint as against Brill, under ORS 31.150, and a motion to dismiss the third-party complaint for failure to state a claim as against both defendants, under ORCP 21 A(8). On the motion to strike, the court concluded that the claims against Brill did not arise from protected activity set out in ORS 31.150 and, on that basis, denied the motion and entered a limited judgment as required by ORS 31.150(1). Defendants appeal that limited judgment. On the motion to dismiss, the trial court granted it with prejudice as to the claims against defendants because their defense was dependent upon attorney-client privileged communications between Brill and DPC. The court entered a limited judgment for defendants on the third-party complaint, and plaintiffs appeal that judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-4\">ANTI-SLAPP SPECIAL MOTION TO STRIKE</p>\n<p id=\"b562-5\">We first address defendants\u2019 appeal of the trial court\u2019s denial of their special motion to strike. Under ORS 31.150(3), a court engages in a two-step burden-shifting process to resolve a special motion to strike filed under the Oregon anti-SLAPP statute. <em>Young v. </em>Davis, 259 Or App 497, 501, 314 P3d 350 (2013). First, the court must determine whether the defendant filing the motion has met its <em>prima facie </em>burden to show that the claim \u201carises out of a statement, document or conduct described in subsection (2).\u201d ORS 31.150(3). Second, if the defendant meets that burden, \u201cthe burden shifts to the plaintiff in the action to establish that there is a probability that the plaintiff will prevail on the claim by presenting substantial evidence to support a prima facie case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Both steps of that analysis present a question of law that we review for legal error. <em>Neumann v. Liles, </em>261 Or App 567, 572, 323 P3d 521 (2014), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>358 Or 706, 369 P3d 1117 (2016). In this case, we conclude that defendants did not meet their burden under the first step of the analysis, and, thus, the trial court did not err in denying defendants\u2019 special motion to strike.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>Defendants had the burden to show that the claims brought against them in plaintiffs\u2019 third-party complaint \u201carise [] out of\u2019 one of the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-4\">\u201c(a) Any oral statement made, or written statement or other document submitted, in a legislative, executive or judicial proceeding or other proceeding authorized by law;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-5\">\u201c(b) Any oral statement made, or written statement or other document submitted, in connection with an issue under consideration or review by a legislative, executive or judicial body or other proceeding authorized by law;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-6\">\u201c(c) Any oral statement made, or written statement or other document presented, in a place open to the public or a public forum in connection with an issue of public interest; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-7\">\u201c(d) Any other conduct in furtherance of the exercise of the constitutional right of petition or the constitutional right of free speech in connection with a public issue or an issue of public interest.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b563-8\">ORS 31.150(2). On appeal, and as explained in more detail below, defendants argue that subsections (2)(b) and (2)(d)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> apply to plaintiffs\u2019 claims against Brill, and, to the extent that those subsections do not sweep in all of plaintiffs\u2019 claims, defendants assert that the remaining claims are only incidental to the protected activity and, thus, also fall within ORS 31.150(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b563-9\">We begin by addressing defendants\u2019 arguments under subsection (2)(d). That subsection provides that a claim that arises out of \u201c[a]ny other conduct in furtherance of the exercise of the constitutional right of petition or the constitutional right of free speech in connection with a public issue or an issue of public interest\u201d is subject to an anti-SLAPP motion. Whether a claim arises out of conduct described in subsection (2)(d) is an inquiry into \u201cmore generally what sort of claim this is.\u201d <em>Mullen v. Meredith Corp., </em>271 Or App 698, 705, 353 P3d 598 (2015).</p>\n<p id=\"b563-10\">Defendants argue that the claims against Brill arise from conduct in furtherance of DPC\u2019s right to petition <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>because plaintiffs\u2019 claims are based on legal advice Brill gave to DPC related to the filing of DPC\u2019s lawsuit against plaintiffs. In so arguing, defendants assert that the conduct, which is in furtherance of the right of petition, need not be \u201cin connection with a public issue or an issue of public interest.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b564-4\">We need not determine whether the claims asserted by plaintiffs against Brill arise from conduct \u201cin furtherance of the constitutional right to petition\u201d because defendants argument that the conduct need not be \u201cin connection with a public issue or an issue of public interest\u201d is contrary to the plain wording of subsection (2)(d). In arguing otherwise, defendants misread the grammatical construction of the subsection, which makes the phrase \u201cin connection with a public issue or an issue of public interest\u201d connected <em>both </em>to conduct in furtherance of the right of petition and conduct in furtherance of the right of free speech. The only public issue or issue of public interest that defendants point to is the exercise of the right of petition in and of itself. However, if that were sufficient under the statute, then the phrase, \u201cin connection with a public issue or an issue of public interest,\u201d would be unnecessary; thus, we reject defendants\u2019 argument. Because defendants do not provide a basis on which Brill\u2019s conduct could be considered \u201cin connection with a public issue or an issue of public interest,\u201d and because we do not readily discern a public interest from these lawsuits which involve the conduct among directors, officers, and shareholders of a private, closely-held corporation, we conclude that defendants did not meet their burden to make a <em>prima facie </em>showing that subsection (2)(d) applies to plaintiffs\u2019 third-party claims against Brill.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-5\">We next turn to defendants\u2019 argument that subsection (2)(b) applies. That subsection provides that a claim that arises out of \u201c[a]ny oral statement made, or written statement or other document submitted, in connection with an issue under consideration or review by a legislative, executive or judicial body or other proceeding authorized by law\u201d is subject to an anti-SLAPP motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-6\">In connection with that subsection, defendants argue that Brill\u2019s approving the lawsuit against plaintiffs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>and failing to inform plaintiffs of DPC\u2019s status after their termination is all conduct in anticipation of litigation that is protected under subsection (2)(b), based on California case law.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Likewise, defendants argue that any of Brill\u2019s conduct surrounding Alekel\u2019s alleged fraud was conduct caused by plaintiffs, done in Brill\u2019s capacity as corporate counsel to DPC, and related to the underlying basis of the lawsuit filed against plaintiffs. Thus, defendants argue that all of that conduct was also in connection to the litigation and protected activity under subsection (2)(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b565-4\">We first note that ORS 31.150 (2)(b) does not include the public issue or public interest wording that is included in subsection (2)(d), and, thus, we reject plaintiffs\u2019 argument to the extent they assert that the public interest requirement also applies to subsection (2)(b). Rather, as relevant here, subsection (2)(b) focuses on claims that arise out of written or oral statements made or submitted \u201cin connection with an issue under consideration by * * * a judicial body.\u201d That subsection plainly covers statements made or documents submitted in connection with a case after it comes \u201cunder consideration\u201d by a court, such as, for example, pleadings filed with a court or statements made by an attorney or a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>witness at a hearing. What is not so clear from the plain text is what, if any, conduct it covers that occurs before an issue becomes \u201cunder consideration\u201d by a court. Defendants, relying on several California cases, assert that subsection (2)(b) covers communications made \u201cin anticipation of litigation\u201d and that, thus, it sweeps in plaintiffs\u2019 claims against Brill which defendants assert are based on Brill\u2019s pre-litigation conduct of advising DPC. We, however, decline to decide whether subsection (2)(b) is as broad as California\u2019s version of the statute because, even under the California case law that defendants urge us to apply, defendants have failed to meet their burden under the anti-SLAPP statute\u2019s first prong.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-4\">In California, under a part of its anti-SLAPP statute that is identically-worded to ORS 31.150(2)(b), the California Supreme Court has concluded that anti-SLAPP protection extends to statements made preparatory to or in anticipation of litigation. <em>Briggs v. Eden Counsel for Hope &amp; Opportunity, </em>19 Cal 4th 1106, 1115, 969 P2d 564, 569 (1999) (citing <em>Dove Audio, Inc. v. Rosenfeld, Meyer &amp; Susman, </em>47 Cal App 4th 777, 784, 54 Cal Rptr 2d 830, 835, <em>rev den, </em>(1996)). The court\u2019s conclusion in that respect was based on California\u2019s statutory litigation privilege, <em>id., </em>which covers statements \u201creasonably related\u201d to pending or contemplated litigation that are made \u201cin anticipation of litigation \u2018contemplated in good faith belief and under serious consideration.\u2019\u201d <em>Neville v. Chudacoff, </em>160 Cal App 4th 1255, 1268, 73 Cal Rptr 3d 383, 393, <em>rev den </em>(2008). However, the California Supreme Court has also clarified that the anti-SLAPP protections and the litigation privilege are not co-extensive because they are not substantively the same nor do they serve the same purposes. <em>Flatley v. Mauro, </em>39 Cal 4th 299, 323-24, 139 P3d 2, 18 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b566-5\">As a result, although California courts have used the litigation privilege as an aid in construing the scope of protected petitioning activity under its anti-SLAPP statute, the inquiry of California courts in such matters remain focused on whether the claims against which a special motion to strike is brought <em>arose from </em>protected petitioning activity, and not on the test used to apply the litigation privilege. <em>See Kolar v. Donahue, McIntosh &amp; Hammerton, </em>145 Cal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>App 4th 1532, 1537, 52 Cal Rptr 3d 712, 716 (2006), <em>rev den </em>(2007) (\u201cAlthough a party\u2019s litigation-related activities constitute \u2018act[s] in furtherance of a person\u2019s right of petition or free speech,\u2019 it does not follow that any claims associated with those activities are subject to the anti-SLAPP statute. To qualify for anti-SLAPP protection, the moving party must demonstrate the claim \u2018arises from\u2019 those activities.\u201d). By so focusing the inquiry, California courts have concluded that claims that do not fall within the anti-SLAPP protection include (1) claims arising from petitioning activity that was illegal as a matter of law, <em>Flatley, </em>39 Cal 4th at 319-20, 139 P3d at 15, and (2) claims arising from \u201cgarden variety\u201d legal malpractice actions because the claim arises from the breach of the attorney\u2019s duty and not from the petitioning activity itself, <em>Kolar, </em>145 Cal App 4th at 1540, 52 Cal Rptr 3d at 718.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-3\">We turn to the legal question of whether plaintiffs\u2019 claims against Brill arose from conduct that comes within the scope of protected petitioning activity, and conclude that they do not. As noted earlier, in reviewing a trial court\u2019s ruling on a special motion to strike, \u201cwe take the facts from the pleadings and from the supporting and opposing declarations and affidavits submitted to the trial court, ORS 31.150(4), and we view the facts underlying [the] plaintiffs claim in the light most favorable to [the] plaintiff.\u201d <em>Plotkin, </em>280 Or App at 815. In undertaking that review, we do not decide the facts or weigh the evidence. Rather, we consider the evidence and draw the reasonable inferences from that evidence in favor of the plaintiff and consider the defendant\u2019s opposing evidence only to determine if it defeats that submitted by the plaintiff as a matter of law. <em>Id. </em>at 815-16.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-4\">Here, the parties dispute what the conduct is from which plaintiffs\u2019 claims \u201carise out of.\u201d As a result, we necessarily must view the evidence on that factual question in the light most favorable to plaintiffs. Based on the affidavits submitted, and plaintiffs\u2019 third-party complaint, the conduct of Brill from which plaintiffs\u2019 claims arise include allegations that Brill (1) advised and assisted in covering up the concerns about Alekel\u2019s crystal, firing LaChapelle, shutting down DPC\u2019s Oregon operations, and transferring assets or intellectual property to Korea to DPC\u2019s financial detriment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>and in violation of the directors\u2019 fiduciary duties, (2) committed legal malpractice by failing to advise DPC of its advancement obligations under DPC\u2019s bylaws in connection with the lawsuit brought against plaintiffs, and (3) participated in \u201cfreezing out\u201d plaintiffs, as minority shareholders, from DPC\u2019s business.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-4\">Although, as discussed above, under California case law, statements made (including legal advice given) in good-faith anticipation of litigation can come within the anti-SLAPP protections when the claims arise from that petitioning activity, none of Brill\u2019s conduct that forms the basis of plaintiffs\u2019 claims meets that standard. With regard to Brill\u2019s actions in guiding the investigation of, and DPC\u2019s response to, LaChapelle\u2019s concerns about Alekel\u2019s crystal, none of the alleged conduct was a statement made, or a writing submitted, in good-faith anticipation of litigation. Defendants\u2019 bald assertion to the contrary is deficient on its face. There is no indication in any of the evidence submitted by either party that, <em>at the time Brill engaged in the alleged conduct, </em>any related litigation was contemplated or that Brill\u2019s actions were specifically taken in relation to such anticipated litigation. The exact same observations apply to Brill\u2019s alleged conduct in conspiring or aiding the directors in firing plaintiffs and transferring DPC\u2019s assets and intellectual property, and in \u201cfreezing out\u201d plaintiffs from DPC\u2019s business.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-5\">The closest conduct, and the conduct on which defendants primarily base their arguments, regards plaintiffs\u2019 claim in the third-party complaint that Brill provided negligent advice to DPC about its obligations under DPC\u2019s bylaws, and negligent advice about the consequences of ignoring those obligations if it went forward with its lawsuit against plaintiffs. Defendants argue that that conduct clearly involves statements made in anticipation of litigation because they are based on Brill\u2019s \u201capproval\u201d of the filing of the lawsuit. We disagree with that characterization.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-6\">To \u201carise out of\u2019 the conduct described in subsection (2)(b), the act underlying the claim itself must have been an act in furtherance of the right to petition and not just associated with it. <em>See Kolar, </em>145 Cal App 4th at 1537, 52 Cal Rptr <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>3d at 716 (\u201cA cause of action may be \u2018triggered by\u2019 or associated with a protected act, but it does not mean the cause or action <em>arises </em>from that act.\u201d). Plaintiffs\u2019 claims do not \u201carise out of\u2019 statements that Brill made to DPC in anticipation of litigation (or, indeed, his \u201capproval\u201d of the lawsuit). Rather, plaintiffs\u2019 claims \u201carise out of\u2019 Brill\u2019s <em>failure </em>to give competent legal advice to DPC, which is not an act in furtherance of the right to petition. In other words, plaintiffs\u2019 claim is not based on Brill\u2019s act of advising DPC to bring a lawsuit; it is based on Brill not competently representing DPC\u2019s interests when he did so. That plaintiffs\u2019 claim was pled as a derivative legal malpractice claim does not change the nature of the acts from which the alleged liability arises\u2014it remains that the nature of those acts are \u201cgarden variety\u201d legal malpractice and not petitioning activity. <em>Id. </em>at 1540, 52 Cal Rptr 3d at 718 (holding the defendant did not make showing under first prong where the plaintiffs claims arose from the defendant\u2019s alleged legal malpractice and not from protected petitioning activity); <em>see also Chodos v. Cole, </em>210 Cal App 4th 692, 705, 148 Cal Rptr 3d 451, 460 (2012), <em>rev den </em>(2013) (\u201cIf an act of malpractice by an attorney alleged by a client is not petitioning or free speech under the anti-SLAPP statute, that same act for the same client should not be deemed to be such petitioning or free speech solely because it is the basis of a claim for indemnity by someone other than the client.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b569-4\">We thus conclude that defendants failed to make a <em>prima facie </em>showing that plaintiffs\u2019 claims against Brill came within either subsection (2)(d) or (2)(b) of ORS 31.150. Accordingly, we affirm the trial court\u2019s dismissal of defendants\u2019 special motion to strike.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-5\">MOTION TO DISMISS UNDER ORCP 21 A(8)</p>\n<p id=\"b569-6\">We turn to the trial court\u2019s grant of defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss the third-party complaint under ORCP 21 A(8). Below, defendants argued that the third-party complaint should be dismissed because their defense was dependent upon attorney-client privileged communications between Brill and DPC and DPC was not agreeing to waive the privilege. Defendants\u2019 argument was based primarily on a California case, <em>McDermott, Will &amp; Emery v. Superior </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number><em>Court, </em>83 Cal App 4th 378, 385, 99 Cal Rptr 2d 622, <em>rev den </em>(2000), in which the California Court of Appeals held that a derivative legal malpractice action brought by a minority shareholder could not proceed because the court \u201csimply [could] not conceive how an attorney is to mount a defense in a shareholder derivative action alleging breach of duty to the corporate client, where * * * the attorney is foreclosed *** from disclosing the very communications which are alleged to constitute a breach of that duty.\u201d Here, the court granted defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss the third-party complaint with prejudice based on <em>McDermott. </em>The trial court reasoned that, because Brill is licensed to practice law only in California and was subject to California professional ethics rules, it should apply the rule from <em>McDermott, </em>even though the trial court acknowledged that it might reach a different result under Oregon law.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-4\">We review the trial court\u2019s grant of a motion to dismiss under ORCP 21 A(8) for errors of law. <em>Hansen v. Anderson, </em>113 Or App 216, 218, 831 P2d 717 (1992). \u201cORCP 21 A(8) decisions on a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim may not be granted on the basis of anything other than the body of the pleadings themselves. * * * A challenge to the legal sufficiency of a claim that requires the court to examine documents other than the pleadings must be pursued via a summary judgment motion.\u201d <em>Rogers v. Valley Bronze of Oregon, Inc., </em>178 Or App 64, 69 n 3, 35 P3d 1102 (2001). Thus, where, as here, a defendant\u2019s ORCP 21 A(8) challenge is based on a defense to otherwise well-pleaded claims, \u201c[t]hat defense is available on an ORCP 21 A(8) motion only if it appears on the face of the complaint.\u201d <em>Mark v. Dept. of Fish and Wildlife, </em>158 Or App 355, 357 n 1, 974 P2d 716, <em>rev den, </em>329 Or 479 (1999). On review of a grant of dismissal under ORCP 21 A(8), \u201cwe accept as true all well-pleaded allegations in the complaint and give plaintiff the benefit of all favorable inferences that may be drawn from the facts alleged.\u201d <em>Granewich, </em>329 Or at 51.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-5\">We start with the question of what law applies in this matter. Plaintiffs assert that the trial court erred in applying California law because the issue is the application of Oregon\u2019s attorney-client privilege, which is a rule <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>of evidence. We agree. In a case recently interpreting an aspect of the attorney-client privilege, the Oregon Supreme Court rejected the defendant\u2019s argument that Washington law pertaining to the scope of the privilege applied because the subject communications occurred between Washington-licensed attorneys in Washington. In rejecting the application of Washington law to the litigation in Oregon, the court stated, \u201cIt is well established in this state that Oregon applies its own rules prescribing how litigation shall be conducted, including its own evidentiary rules.\u201d <em>Crimson Trace Corp. v. Davis Wright Tremaine LLP, </em>355 Or 476, 491, 326 P3d 1181 (2014) (citing <em>Equitable Life Assurance v. McKay, </em>306 Or 493, 497-98, 760 P2d 871 (1988)). Thus, the trial court erred in concluding that it should apply California law on the basis that Brill is a California lawyer.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-4\">The trial court\u2019s concern that applying Oregon law could subject Brill to discipline in California under California ethics rules was not a valid reason to ignore established Oregon law and apply California evidence rules in an Oregon case. Ethics rules governing the practice of law have no bearing on our interpretation of statutory evidence rules, including the attorney-client privilege. <em>Id. </em>at 501 (\u201cAs in <em>[State v. Miller, </em>300 Or 203, 709 P2d 225 (1985)], rules of professional conduct may require or prohibit certain conduct, and the breach of those rules may lead to disciplinary proceedings. But that has no bearing on the interpretation or application of a rule of evidence that clearly applies.\u201d). We thus reject defendants\u2019 arguments related to the application of California law. However, to the extent we find the California case law persuasive and relevant to our analysis, we will consider it.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-5\">For purposes of our discussion, we assume, without deciding, that Oregon law would recognize a defense to liability based on the attorney-client privilege. <em>See Reynolds v. Schrock, </em>341 Or 338, 351, 142 P3d 1062 (2006) (discussing similar principles based on the litigation privilege). We thus start with a brief explanation of the scope and application of Oregon\u2019s attorney-client privilege, and its exceptions. The attorney-client privilege, OEC 503, is codified in ORS 40.225, which provides, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b572-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>\u201c(2) A client has a privilege to refuse to disclose and to prevent any other person from disclosing confidential communications made for the purpose of facilitating the rendition of professional legal services to the client:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b572-4\">\u201c(a) Between the client or the client\u2019s representative and the client\u2019s lawyer or a representative of the lawyer [.] \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">Thus, a claim of privilege generally may be asserted if (1) the communication is between a \"client\u201d or \u201ca representative of the client\u201d and the client\u2019s \u201clawyer,\u201d as those terms are defined in OEC 503, (2) the communication is a \u201cconfidential communication,\u201d as defined in OEC 503, and (3) the communication is \u201cmade for the purpose of facilitating the rendition of professional legal services to the client.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>Crimson Trace Corp., </em>355 Or at 486 (quoting OEC 503). However, the attorney-client privilege is not absolute; it may be waived by the client voluntarily, OEC 511, or one of the enumerated exceptions in OEC 503(4) may apply. Those exceptions are as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b572-6\">\u201c(4) There is no privilege under this section:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b572-7\">\u201c(a) If the services of the lawyer were sought or obtained to enable or aid anyone to commit or plan to commit what the client knew or reasonably should have known to be a crime or fraud;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b573-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>\u201c(b) As to a communication relevant to an issue between parties who claim through the same deceased client, regardless of whether the claims are by testate or intestate succession or by inter vivos transaction;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b573-4\">\u201c(c) As to a communication relevant to an issue of breach of duty by the lawyer to the client or by the client to the lawyer;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b573-5\">\u201c(d) As to a communication relevant to an issue concerning an attested document to which the lawyer is an attesting witness; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b573-6\">\u201c(e) As to a communication relevant to a matter of common interest between two or more clients if the communication was made by any of them to a lawyer retained or consulted in common, when offered in an action between any of the clients.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b573-7\">OEC 503(4). Those enumerated exceptions are the exclusive exceptions to the attorney-client privilege in Oregon. <em>Crimson Trace Corp., </em>355 Or at 501.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-8\">Thus, to the extent such a defense is available in Oregon, to make out a complete defense based on the attorney-client privilege, on a motion to dismiss under ORCP 21 A(8), a defendant must show that the attorney-client privilege applies to all of the allegations in the complaint such that it prevents the defendant from mounting an effective defense. That requires a defendant to show that it is apparent on the face of the complaint that attorney-client protected communications exist that are necessary to the defense of the complaint and that the client has not waived the privilege under OEC 511 with respect to those communications. In turn, a plaintiff thus may defeat that showing on a motion to dismiss if the allegations in the complaint support a reasonable inference that the attorney was not acting in his or her capacity as legal counsel to the client <em>(i.e., </em>acting outside the attorney-client relationship), or that an exception in OEC 503(4) applies to the attorney-client privileged communications that are necessary to the attorney\u2019s defense. <em>Cf. Reynolds, </em>341 Or at 351 (litigation privilege does not apply with respect to claims by third party against a lawyer for aiding the lawyer\u2019s client in breaching a fiduciary duty to the third party if the third party shows that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>lawyer was acting outside the attorney-client relationship or the \u201ccrime or fraud\u201d exception to attorney-client privilege applies).</p>\n<p id=\"b574-4\">Here, the trial court erred in granting defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss the entire third-party complaint because it is not apparent on the face of the third-party complaint that the attorney-client privilege prevented defendants from defending against all of the claims against them. With regard to the application of the privilege to defendants\u2019 alleged conduct, the privilege would only apply with respect to communications made when Brill was acting in his capacity as corporate counsel to DPC, that is, when the communications were \u201cmade for the purpose of facilitating the rendition of professional legal services to [DPC].\u201d OEC 503(2). Here, taking the allegations and all reasonable inferences from those allegations as true, there are two sets of allegations against defendants that fall outside that attorney-client relationship and thus do not, on their face, implicate the attorney-client privilege as a barrier to defendants mounting a defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">First, with respect to plaintiffs\u2019 derivative action, based on the well-pleaded allegations in the third-party complaint, Brill was not acting as legal counsel to DPC with respect to any of the allegations that he aided or conspired with the directors in breaching their fiduciary duties to DPC, which include the allegations of facilitating a cover-up of Alekel\u2019s alleged fraud, firing plaintiffs, shutting down the Oregon operations, and transferring DPC\u2019s assets to Kim\u2019s control. That is so because such alleged acts were not taken by Brill for the purpose of rendering legal services to DPC\u2014 the only client\u2014nor were they acts taken by the directors, as client representatives, to obtain legal services for DPC. Rather, those are alleged acts that were taken against DPC\u2019s interests, and in the self-interest of the directors and defendants, and thus were acts that fell outside of the attorney-client relationship between Brill and DPC. The third-party complaint also alleges that those actions were provided outside the scope of the attorney-client relationship and were not privileged. <em>Cf. Reynolds, </em>341 Or at 351 (the rule that a lawyer cannot be liable for a client\u2019s breach of a fiduciary duty to a third party does not apply when the lawyer acts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>outside the attorney-client relationship for that client, which includes \u201cnot protect [ing] lawyer conduct that is unrelated to the representation of a client\u201d and \u201cnot protect [ing] lawyers who are representing clients but who act only in their own self-interest and contrary to their client\u2019s interest\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b575-4\">Second, with respect to LaChapelle\u2019s direct action, Enterprise Law Group was not acting in the capacity of legal counsel to DPC when it engaged in oppressive conduct <em>as a shareholder </em>against plaintiffs as the minority shareholders, which included allegations that the majority shareholders engaged in conduct \u201cto force LaChapelle from the company, freeze him out, and give his position and authority over to themselves for their own benefit, all of which resulted in the destruction of the company, as demonstrated by its current residence in bankruptcy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">The only claim that, on the face of the third-party complaint, implicates the attorney-client privilege as preventing defendants from mounting a defense is plaintiffs\u2019 derivative claim that Brill committed legal malpractice in his failure to properly advise DPC before DPC filed its complaint against plaintiffs. However, that is only one of the claims against defendants in the third-party complaint, and, thus, the trial court erred in dismissing the entire third-party complaint with prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-6\">With respect to the derivative legal malpractice claim, which does <em>implicate </em>the attorney-client privilege on its face, the trial court nonetheless prematurely dismissed that claim because the litigation was at a point before which defendants could show that any attorney-client communications existed that were material to their defense. <em>See Checkley v. Boyd, </em>170 Or App 721, 731, 14 P3d 81 (2000), <em>rev den, </em>332 Or 239 (2001) (dismissal of complaint under ORCP 21 A(8) on free exercise of religion grounds was premature where the most the court could conclude from the allegations in the complaint was that the statements were potentially religious in nature, but not necessarily so, as a matter of law). There is nothing on the face of the third-party complaint about what, if any, attorney-client communications exist that would be necessary to Brill\u2019s defense on the derivative malpractice claim <em>(i.e., </em>that there was advice <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>given, instead of just a failure to advise, as alleged in the third-party complaint).</p>\n<p id=\"b576-3\">Moreover, because the case was proceeding against the other directors based on the same allegations\u2014including that those directors had DPC proceed with litigation against plaintiffs without understanding DPC\u2019s obligations under the bylaws\u2014the court could have stayed the proceedings as to defendants to determine, as the litigation progressed, whether DPC ultimately waived the privilege for any attorney-client communications shown to exist that would be necessary to defendants\u2019 defense or whether an exception under OEC 503(4) applied to those communications. <em>See Favila v. Katten Muchin Rosenman </em>LLP, 188 Cal App 4th 189, 221, 115 Cal Rptr 3d 274, 300, <em>rev den </em>(2010) (\u201cIt would be unfair to the derivative plaintiff and unnecessary to the preservation of the lawyer-client privilege to dismiss the lawsuit based on the <em>McDermott Will </em>holding only to see the attorneys\u2019 client willingly waive its privilege to permit other defendants to defend themselves in the same lawsuit or to discover after such a dismissal that the evidence developed in the lawsuit against the allegedly culpable corporate insiders establishes the applicability of the crime-fraud exception [to the lawyer-client privilege].\u201d). Because the case did proceed against the directors, the trial court can on remand make those determinations in the first instance without a further stay of proceedings against defendants on the derivate malpractice claim. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b576-4\">Accordingly, we reverse and remand on plaintiffs\u2019 appeals for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">In A154999, affirmed.

Parsons, </em>249 Or App 445, 461-62, 277 P3d 609 (2012) (discussing legislative history of Oregon\u2019s anti-SLAPP statute). However, in considering California case law in the anti-SLAPP context, we are mindful of the caution noted by the Supreme Court, in another context, on relying on case law interpreting the meaning of a parent statute in determining the meaning of an Oregon law modeled on that parent statute. In <em>OR-OSHA v. CBI Services, Inc., </em>356 Or 577, 593, 341 P3d 701 (2014), the court noted,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-6\">\u201cCourt decisions that existed at the time that the legislature enacted a statute\u2014and that, as a result, it could have been aware of\u2014may be consulted in determining what the legislature intended in enacting the law as part of the context for the legislature\u2019s decision. * * * That is so especially as to case law interpreting the wording of a statute borrowed from another jurisdiction. * * <em>*</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"abm-dedup-0\">\u201cCase law published after enactment\u2014of which the legislature could not have been aware\u2014is another matter.
