J.</author>\n<p id=\"b507-4\">Plaintiff, Clinton Condominiums Owners Association (the Association), appeals the trial court\u2019s grant of summary-judgment in favor of defendant, Truck Insurance Exchange.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-5\">The case arose out of the following circumstances. In a lawsuit that preceded this case, the Association brought claims for negligence and breach of contract against We Do Windows, Inc., a window washing company that the Association had hired to work at its condominium building. We Do Windows tendered those claims to its insurer, defendant, to defend and indemnify it. Defendant denied the tender. At some point, the Association and We Do Windows entered into a settlement and, as part of that settlement, We Do Windows assigned its claims against defendant to the Association. Thereafter, the Association, as assignee of We Do Window\u2019s rights and claims, filed this action against defendant for breach of contract and breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing. However, the policies under which defendant issued insurance to We Do Windows contain antiassignment clauses, which provide that We Do Windows cannot assign any rights or claims under the policy without defendant\u2019s consent.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-6\">Defendant filed a motion for summary judgment, asserting that the Association had no standing to bring its claims because the antiassignment clauses \u201cprovide that We Do Windows\u2019 \u2018rights and duties under this policy may not be transferred without [defendant\u2019s] written consent,\u201d\u2019 and defendant never provided such consent. The Association argued that, regardless of the text of the policies, ORS 31.825 made the antiassignment clauses \u201cinvalid and unenforceable.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The trial court agreed with defendant and granted the motion for summary judgment, determining that the antiassignment clauses were \u201cclear, unambiguous, valid and enforceable,\u201d and further, that they were not \u201crendered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>unenforceable by ORS 31.825.\u201d Accordingly, the court concluded that the Association lacked \u201cstanding to assert its claims against Defendant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b508-3\">On appeal, the Association again asserts that the antiassignment \u201cprovisions within the * * * insurance policies are invalidated by * * * ORS 31.825.\u201d Defendant responds that the Association\u2019s argument is \u201cuntenable in light of the Oregon Supreme Court\u2019s recent ruling\u201d in <em>Brownstone Homes Condo. Assn. v. Brownstone Forest Hts., </em>358 Or 223, 363 P3d 467 (2015). We agree that <em>Brownstone </em>controls the outcome in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-4\">In that case, the court considered the types of actions to which ORS 31.825 applies. It observed that ORS 31.825, by its plain text,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-5\">\u201climits the defendant\u2019s power to assign causes of action \u2018that the defendant has against the defendant\u2019s insurer <em>as a result of the judgment.\u2019\u2019 </em>The cause of action that may be assigned is one that \u2018result [s]\u2019 from the judgment, which again suggests a particular sequence and a particular type of claims. If, for example, an insurer refused in bad faith to settle within the applicable policy limits, leading to a judgment against the insured in excess of the policy limits, such a claim could be said to be \u2018as a result of a judgment.\u2019\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b508-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 233 (emphasis and brackets in original). The court then examined the legislative history underlying the statute, which it concluded \u201cdispel [led] any doubt about what the legislature intended by enacting ORS 31.825.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 236. That is, the legislature</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-7\">\u201cintended to allow insured defendants to assign a specific type of claim against their insurer\u2014claims that the insurer\u2019s negligent or bad faith failure to settle within policy limits had resulted in an \u2018excess judgment\u2019\u2014to the plaintiff, in exchange for a covenant not to execute against the defendant, without extinguishing the underlying liability. And it intended to permit that outcome only when the excess judgment is in place <em>before </em>the assignment is given.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b508-8\"><em>Id. </em>(emphasis in original). Because the claims at issue in <em>Brownstone </em>were directed at the insurer\u2019s asserted breach of a contractual duty to defend and indemnify the insured, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>claims did not \u201c \u2018result\u2019 in any direct sense from a iudgment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 233.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-4\">As defendant in this case points out, contrary to the Association\u2019s contention, ORS 31.825 relates to the assignment of claims that arise from a judgment against the insured, \u201cnot from the underlying insurance policy.\u201d In other words, as the <em>Brownstone </em>court explained, ORS 31.825 is directed toward allowing an insured to assign excess judgment claims. It does not apply to the types of claims at issue in this case. The trial court correctly rejected the Association\u2019s contention that the statute rendered the anti-assignment clauses in the insurance policies in this case unenforceable and invalid. Thus, the court did not err in granting defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment on the ground that the Association did not have standing.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b507-7\"> ORS 31.825 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-8\">\u201cA defendant in a tort action against whom a judgment has been rendered may assign any cause of action that defendant has against the defendant\u2019s insurer as a result of the judgment to the plaintiff in whose favor the judgment has been entered. That assignment and any release or covenant given for the assignment shall not extinguish the cause of action against the insurer unless the assignment specifically so provides.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
