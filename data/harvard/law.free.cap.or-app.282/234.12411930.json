J.</author>\n<p id=\"b257-4\">Petitioner, a licensed veterinarian, seeks judicial review of a final order issued by the Oregon Veterinary Medical Examining Board (the board) in which it concluded that petitioner engaged in \u201cunprofessional conduct,\u201d ORS 686.120<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and ORS 686.130,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and, as a sanction, ordered him to pay a $750 penalty and $5,594.28 for the costs of the proceedings, ORS 686.150. We \u201creview for substantial evidence, substantial reason, and errors of law.\u201d <em>Papas v. OLCC, </em>213 Or App 369, 371, 161 P3d 948 (2007). Because we conclude that the board\u2019s order lacks substantial reason, we reverse and remand the order.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">We summarize the facts, which are undisputed, from the record and as found in the board\u2019s final order. In the summer of 2007, petitioner agreed to participate in a mentoring program for veterinary students at Oregon State University.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> As part of that program, petitioner hired F, a veterinary student, to work as an assistant at his hospital that summer. F performed a variety of tasks under petitioner\u2019s supervision, including, in relevant part, administering rabies vaccinations. The record reflects that F performed her duties more than adequately.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-6\">In January 2008, the board sent petitioner a notice of proposed discipline after receiving complaints related to F\u2019s work at the hospital, though the nature of the complaints is unclear. Following its initial notice, the board sent petitioner two amended notices of proposed disciplinary action. In the operative notice, the board alleged that petitioner was subject to discipline for unprofessional conduct under ORS 686.130(6) by \u201chaving [a] professional connection with the illegal practice of veterinary medicine\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>OAR 875-011-0010(24) by \u201cviolating] *** other state laws relating to veterinary practice.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The board claimed that, by allowing F to administer up to 10 rabies vaccinations, petitioner had violated OAR 333-019-0017(2)(a) - (c), which provides that rabies vaccinations are \u201cvalid only when performed\u201d by a licensed veterinarian, a veterinary technician under the direct supervision of a licensed veterinarian, or another person approved by the State Public Health Veterinarian.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The board claimed that petitioner was responsible for F\u2019s failure to comply with the rabies rule because of OAR 875-015-0005(3), which makes a practitioner responsible for any noncompliant condition in his clinic.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-4\">In November 2010, an administrative law judge (ALJ) held a contested case hearing on the matter. After hearing testimony by petitioner and Dr. Emilio DeBess (the State Public Health Veterinarian), the ALJ issued a proposed order in which he concluded that \u201c[petitioner\u2019s] allowance of a veterinary student to administer rabies vaccinations did not constitute unprofessional conduct under ORS 686.130.\u201d The ALJ opined that the rabies rule addressed only the <em>validity </em>of a rabies vaccination and was unrelated to the <em>practice </em>of veterinary medicine. That is, the ALJ opined that the only consequence for failure to comply with the requirements of the rabies rule was that the vaccination was invalid. Therefore, the ALJ concluded that F could not be considered an \u201cillegal practitioner\u201d and, thus, petitioner could not be disciplined for having a \u201cprofessional connection with\u201d an illegal practitioner under ORS 686.130(6) and that, \u201ceven if [petitioner] allowed [F] to perform rabies vaccinations that turned out to be invalid, he did not \u2018violate\u2019 the law\u201d for the purposes of OAR 875-011-0010(24).</p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">Following the ALJ\u2019s order, the board issued and withdrew a series of orders. A complete recitation of that procedural history and the substance of those orders is not necessary to our analysis. In its final order, the board rejected <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>the ALJ\u2019s determination and concluded that petitioner \u201cdid engage in professional conduct under ORS 686.130 and OAR 875-011-0010(24) when he allowed a veterinary student to administer rabies vaccinations in his clinic in violation of [the rabies rule]The board stated, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-4\">\u201cThe factual record is indisputable that [petitioner] allowed [F] to administer rabies vaccines under his direct control within his clinic in 2007, in violation of OAR 333-019-0017. This rule qualifies as an \u2018other state law relating to veterinary practice.\u2019 The Board observes that this rule is well known in the profession, and the underlying need for the rule is grounded in the necessity to protect public health and safety. As a result, [petitioner] violated OAR 875-011-0010(24), which defines unprofessional or dishonorable conduct, ORS 686.130. Clearly, [petitioner] did violate \u2018other laws\u2019 when he allowed [F] to administer the rabies vaccine under his direct control in 2007. Licensees are responsible for noncompliant conditions in their clinics pursuant to OAR 875-015-0005(3).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">The board then addressed the exceptions that petitioner had filed in response to the board\u2019s proposed order, ultimately rejecting them. In relevant part, petitioner had challenged the board\u2019s legal conclusions by pointing to ORS 686.040(13) (2007),<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> which he claimed had provided statutory authority for P to administer rabies vaccinations. In addressing that exception, the board stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-6\">\u201cIn [petitioner\u2019s] other written exception, that was received March 4, 2011, he contends that ORS 686.040(13), as it existed in 2007, serves to exempt [F] from being considered an \u2018illegal practitioner.\u2019 The Board concedes that ORS 686.130(6) is not applicable to this case. Nevertheless, this argument does not address the fact that [petitioner] allowed the student *** to administer rabies vaccines to animals in his clinic, something that she lacked the legal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>authority to do, whether or not she was working under his direct supervision and whether or not she was working under the auspices of an approved educational program.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b260-3\">Having concluded that petitioner engaged in unprofessional conduct by violating OAR 875-011-0010(24), the board assessed a civil penalty of $750 against petitioner, as well as $5,594.28 in costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-4\">On appeal, petitioner reprises his challenge to the board\u2019s order. In his first assignment of error, he contends that the board erred by concluding that petitioner engaged in unprofessional conduct under OAR 875-011-0010(24). Petitioner\u2019s two other assignments of error (assignments four and five) challenge the resulting sanctions.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">Turning to petitioner\u2019s first assignment of error, we begin by summarizing the statutory framework and administrative rules that govern the discipline of licensed veterinary practitioners. As noted, ORS 686.120(1) authorizes the board to discipline any \u201cpermit or license holder\u201d for \u201cunprofessional or dishonorable conduct.\u201d ORS 686.130, in turn, defines \u201cunprofessional or dishonorable conduct,\u201d listing 15 types of proscribed conduct. Although the term \u201cunprofessional or dishonorable conduct\u201d is statutorily defined, the board has promulgated a rule to interpret<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> that term. In particular, the board promulgated OAR 875-011-0010, which provides a nonexhaustive list of acts that the board interprets as \u201cunprofessional or dishonorable conduct.\u201d That currently includes, in relevant part, subsection (24), which provides that a practitioner may be disciplined for \u201c[vjiolations of <em>other laws </em>that relate to the practice of veterinary medicine, including violations of the Oregon Racing Commission statutes and administrative rules.\u201d OAR 875-011-0010(24) (emphasis added). The \u201cother law\u201d at issue in this case is the rabies rule, which is a rule promulgated by the Public Health Division, an agency distinct from the board.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>On appeal, petitioner raises three arguments as to why the board\u2019s conclusion that he violated OAR 875-011-0010(24) is incorrect. First, he claims that F was authorized by statute to administer the rabies vaccines under the relevant licensing statutes; therefore, if her conduct was authorized, the board could not have found that petitioner engaged in unprofessional conduct. Second, petitioner argues that, even if F was not authorized to administer the vaccinations, her administration of the vaccines did not constitute a \u201cviolation of law,\u201d as proscribed by OAR 875-011-0010(24); rather, the only consequence would be that the vaccines would be invalid under the rabies rule. Third, petitioner contends that the board\u2019s decision is not supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-3\">The board, in turn, maintains that it correctly determined that petitioner engaged in unprofessional conduct under OAR 875-011-0010(24). Specifically, the board contends that the rabies rule qualifies as an \u201cother law\u201d related to the practice of veterinary medicine, which petitioner violated by allowing F, who was unlicensed and uncertified, to administer rabies vaccinations. Further, the board argues that it correctly rejected petitioner\u2019s arguments regarding the effect of ORS 686.040(13). Ultimately, the board claims that, because its interpretation is plausible and consistent with the wording of the rule and its context, we must give deference to its interpretation under <em>Don\u2019t Waste Oregon Com. v. Energy Facility Siting, </em>320 Or 132, 142, 881 P2d 119 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b261-4\">Once more, we review the board\u2019s order for substantial evidence, substantial reason, and legal error. As the Supreme Court has explained, in addition to the substantial evidence requirement for findings, \u201cagencies are also required to demonstrate in their opinions the <em>reasoning </em>that leads the agency from the <em>facts </em>that it has found to the <em>conclusions </em>that it draws from those facts.\u201d <em>Drew v. PSRB, </em>322 Or 491, 499-500, 909 P2d 1211 (1996) (emphases in original). That is, \u201c[u]nder our substantial reason review of an order in a contested case, we determine whether the agency\u2019s factual findings logically lead to its conclusions of law.\u201d <em>Papas, </em>213 Or App at 377; <em>see also Ross v. Springfield School Dist. No. 19, </em>294 Or 357, 370, 657 P2d 188 (1982) (\u201cIt <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>is essential that an agency articulate in a contested case the rational connection between the facts and the legal conclusion it draws from them.\u201d). In this case, we conclude that the board\u2019s order lacks substantial reason because the board failed to adequately explain the reasoning in support of its legal conclusion, particularly in light of petitioner\u2019s exceptions. <em>See Drew, </em>322 Or at 499-500 (review for substantial reason is based on the order itself, not our independent review of the record).</p>\n<p id=\"b262-4\">Petitioner\u2019s fundamental contention is, and consistently has been, that he did not engage in unprofessional conduct because F was statutorily authorized, under ORS 686.040(13), to administer rabies vaccinations at the time that she was working under his supervision. However, in its order, the board failed to adequately address why it rejected petitioner\u2019s argument. <em>See Becklin v. Board of Examiners for Engineering, </em>195 Or App 186, 200, 97 P3d 1216 (2004), <em>rev den, </em>338 Or 16 (2005) (\u201c[A]gency must consider any timely exceptions and argument before issuing a final order.\u201d); <em>Freeman v. Employment Dept., </em>195 Or App 417, 425, 98 P3d 402 (2004) (department\u2019s order lacked substantial reason where the department failed to adequately address why claimant\u2019s argument was wrong).</p>\n<p id=\"b262-5\">For the first time on appeal, the board claims that petitioner\u2019s interpretation is wrong because it creates a \u201cneedless conflict\u201d between ORS 686.040(13), which governs the practice of veterinary medicine by unlicensed persons, and the rabies rule. The board states that, \u201c [g] iven the overarching purpose of the statutory scheme governing the practice of veterinary medicine, it can safely be said that the legislature did not intend to create a public health concern by allowing students to perform a task that the Public Health Division has expressly prohibited.\u201d However, far from being \u201cneedless,\u201d it appears that petitioner is caught exactly in the middle of that apparent conflict, between the statutory scheme regulating veterinary practice and the Public Health Division\u2019s rule. The board\u2019s order fails to adequately address that conflict by gliding over the question of whether F\u2019s conduct was permissible under the statutes regulating veterinary practice and, if so, why that did not matter in the interpretation and application of OAR 875-011-0010(24). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>Once again, in addressing petitioner\u2019s exception, the board merely stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-4\">\u201cIn [petitioner\u2019s] other written exception, that was received March 4, 2011, he contends that ORS 686.040(13), <em>as it existed in 2007, serves to exempt [F] from being considered an \u2018illegal practitioner.\u2019 The Board concedes that ORS 686.130(6) is not applicable to this case. </em>Nevertheless, this argument does not address the fact that [petitioner] allowed the student * * * to administer rabies vaccines to animals in his clinic, <em>something that she lacked the legal authority to do, </em>whether or not she was working under his direct supervision and whether or not she was working under the auspices of an approved educational program.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">(Emphases added.)<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b263-6\">As we understand the order, the board reached two conclusions: (1) F\u2019s administration of rabies vaccinations did not constitute the illegal practice of veterinary medicine (\u201cORS 686.040(13) *** serves to exempt [F] from being considered an \u2018illegal practitioner.\u2019 The board concedes that ORS 686.130(6) is not applicable to this case\u201d); and (2) F did not have the legal authority to administer the vaccinations because that practice was proscribed by the rabies rule. Those two conclusions are contradictory because they suggest that F\u2019s conduct was both illegal and legal. The board\u2019s order neither explained nor resolved that contradiction, particularly in the context of OAR 875-011-0010(24) and ORS 686.130, which specifically address unprofessional conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-7\">In its order, the board summarily concluded that petitioner engaged in unprofessional conduct under OAR 875-011-0010(24) because he\u2014through F\u2019s conduct\u2014failed to fully comply with the rabies rule. However, if, as petitioner argues, the broad language of ORS 686.040(13) indeed authorized F to administer rabies vaccines, then it is unclear why allowing that permitted practice was grounds <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>for discipline. It may be true, as the board suggests, that F\u2019s failure to comply with the rabies rule was sufficient to support the disciplinary charges against petitioner, regardless of whether that conduct was otherwise permitted, but the board has not explained why that is so. Accordingly, we must reverse and remand the board\u2019s order for further explanation of its conclusion. <em>Cf. Cochran v. Board of Psychologist Examiners, </em>171 Or App 311, 320, 15 P3d 73 (2000) (remanding the board\u2019s order, in part, because the board failed to explain why petitioner should be disciplined for presenting unqualified expert testimony in a judicial proceeding where the court nevertheless permitted the introduction of that testimony, presumably after meeting the minimum standards of reliability). Accordingly, we reverse and remand the order to the board for reconsideration.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b264-4\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b257-7\"> ORS 686.120(1) grants the board the authority to discipline \u201cany permit or license holder * * * for unprofessional or dishonorable conduct.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b257-8\"> ORS 686.130 defines \u201cunprofessional conduct,\u201d listing 15 types of proscribed acts.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b257-9\"> The mentoring program was sponsored by the Oregon Veterinary Medical Association (OVMA), a separate entity from the board.
