After filing her appeal, the trial court granted child\u2019s motion under ORS 419B.923 to set aside the guardianship order. Subsequently, mother filed a notice of probable mootness of mother\u2019s appeal of the guardianship order. Both the Department of Human Services and child agree with mother that, because the trial court set aside the guardianship order, this appeal is moot. <em>See, e.g., Dept. of Human Services v. J. G., </em>239 Or App 261, 264, 244 P3d 385 (2010) (\u201cA case is moot when the court\u2019s decision will not have a practical effect on the parties\u2019 rights.\u201d). We agree with the parties and, accordingly, dismiss the appeal as moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-5\">Appeal dismissed as moot.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
