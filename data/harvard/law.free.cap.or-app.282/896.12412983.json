J.</author>\n<p id=\"b920-4\">In this consolidated criminal appeal, defendant challenges his 15 convictions for sex offenses committed against two victims, J and A.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He assigns error to the trial court\u2019s exclusion of his proffered evidence concerning an allegedly false allegation of sexual abuse made by A against defendant\u2019s wife, asserting that the exclusion violated his confrontation rights under both Article I, section 11, of the Oregon Constitution and the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution. That is, defendant contends that our decision in <em>State v. LeClair, </em>83 Or App 121, 730 P2d 609 (1986), provides him the right, under the state and federal confrontation clauses, to cross-examine A because there was evidence that A had made prior false accusations. The state asserts that defendant\u2019s motions and arguments in the trial court were entirely different from the argument based on <em>LeClair </em>that he now makes on appeal. We agree with the state and, accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-5\">The relevant facts are mostly procedural in nature and are not disputed. Defendant and his wife lived in a crowded household with extended family members, including his step-granddaughters, J and A. Based on allegations made against defendant by J and A, the state charged defendant with four counts of first-degree rape, ORS 163.375, three counts of first-degree unlawful sexual penetration, ORS 163.411, and eight counts of first-degree sexual abuse, ORS 163.427. J was the victim of 13 of the 15 crimes alleged in the indictment; A was the victim of the remaining two alleged crimes.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-6\">Before trial, defendant filed a motion under OEC 412 (the \u201crape-shield rule\u201d), asking the trial court to allow him to present to the jury evidence that, approximately three months after defendant was arrested, A had also accused her grandmother\u2014defendant\u2019s wife\u2014of sexually <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"899\">*899</page-number>abusing A when she was younger.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The motion included an offer of proof, listing several witnesses and a summary of their proposed testimony. <em>See </em>OEC 412(4)(b) (so requiring). Defendant argued that A\u2019s allegation against defendant\u2019s wife was admissible under OEC 412(2) to prove that A had a motive to falsely report abuse against defendant so that she could move in with her father.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-3\">The state opposed the motion, arguing during a pretrial hearing that the evidence defendant sought to offer was not evidence of the victim\u2019s \u201cpast sexual behavior\u201d governed by OEC 412, but, instead, was evidence of an alleged prior false accusation. The state explained that <em>LeClair </em>governs the analysis of the admissibility of alleged prior false accusations and further argued that, in its view, <em>LeClair </em>would allow defendant only to <em>cross-examine </em>A about those false accusations.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-4\">Defendant acknowledged that his OEC 412 motion was filed \u201cout of an abundance of caution\u201d and that OEC 412 was not the applicable evidentiary rule for the evidence he sought to admit. Defendant, however, argued that he was not limited to cross-examination of A on the subject of her allegations against defendant\u2019s wife. Defendant stated, \u201cif [A] is permitted to testify to this false allegation * * * I\u2019m not left with her response, I have freedom to introduce more specific acts for the purposes of establishing motive.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b921-5\">Defendant explained that he thought the false-accusation evidence against defendant\u2019s wife bore \u201ca striking resemblance to the disclosures of sex abuse leveled against defendant\u201d and, therefore, was a prior act that could be admitted to show motive under OEC 404(3), subject to <em>State </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"900\">*900</page-number><em>v. Johns, </em>301 Or 535, 725 P2d 312 (1986). Defendant reiterated, \u201cWhile the State says that I\u2019m limited to what the victim says, I disagree.\u201d After the state reasserted its position that <em>LeClair </em>limited defendant to cross-examination of A if A admitted during an OEC 104 hearing that her accusations against defendant\u2019s wife were false, the trial court announced that it would wait until it heard A\u2019s testimony outside the presence of the jury before ruling on what evidence would be allowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-4\">The following day, defendant made an offer of proof of the testimony of Detective Shipley, one of the witnesses listed in his OEC 412 motion. Shipley, a police officer involved in the investigation of the case, testified that, for a number of reasons, he had concerns about the truthfulness of A\u2019s accusations against defendant\u2019s wife. After Shipley testified, defendant reiterated that he was not relying on OEC 412 as a means to admit evidence of A\u2019s false accusations against defendant\u2019s wife and asserted that they were admissible under OEC 404(3) and OEC 404(2). Defendant then submitted a new written motion to the court, captioned \u201cMotion to Allow Evidence Under OEC 404(2)(3),\u201d which listed nine witnesses, including A, and described testimony from them about (among other things) A\u2019s allegations of sexual touching by defendant\u2019s wife (including inconsistencies in those allegations), and the custody battle over A between her parents. Again, defendant stated that he was offering the evidence under OEC 404(3) for the noncharacter purpose of proving motive under a \u201cdoctrine of chances\u201d theory under <em>Johns.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b922-5\">The next day, the court allowed defendant to examine A in an offer of proof outside the presence of the jury after defendant again explained that his purpose was to \u201cshow[] motive\u201d because of the \u201cstriking similarity\u201d between A\u2019s accusations against defendant and defendant\u2019s wife and that, under <em>Johns </em>balancing, it was admissible. In the offer of proof, A testified that, among other things, (1) she had reported to her aunt that defendant\u2019s wife had sexually abused her when she was younger, (2) she had wanted to live with her father before making the sex-abuse allegations, and (3) her allegations were truthful.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"901\">*901</page-number>After the offer of proof, defendant argued that, because law enforcement had never charged defendant\u2019s wife with a crime, A had accomplished her goal of living with her father, and the description of the abuse was similar to the alleged abuse by defendant, A\u2019s testimony was \u201cbeing offered as character evidence as a specific example based on the nature of the similarities for the purposes of advancing the Defense\u2019s case.\u201d The state argued that defendant\u2019s evidence was insufficient to satisfy \u201cthe threshold issue of a prior false allegation.\u201d The trial court agreed with the state\u2019s contention and ruled that the evidence would be excluded. Ultimately, the jury found defendant guilty of all the charges against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-4\">As noted, defendant asserts on appeal that the trial court violated his confrontation rights under both Article I, section 11, and the Sixth Amendment \u201cby excluding evidence of a victim\u2019s false allegation of sexual assault\u201d; specifically, defendant bases his argument on the court\u2019s failure to conduct a <em>LeClair </em>analysis. In response, the state argues, in part, that defendant did not preserve the <em>LeClair </em>argument that he now asserts on appeal. We begin and end with the state\u2019s preservation argument, which is dispositive. <em>See State v. Wyatt, </em>331 Or 335, 340, 15 P3d 22 (2000) (considering preservation first).</p>\n<p id=\"b923-5\">Initially, a brief review of the law surrounding OEC 608 and LeClair\u2014the law on which defendant bases his appeal\u2014is helpful to understanding the parties\u2019 arguments on preservation. In general, use of \u201c[s]pecific instances of the conduct of a witness, for the purpose of attacking * * * the credibility of the witness\u201d is forbidden. OEC 608(2). However, in <em>LeClair, </em>we observed that \u201c[e]vidence of prior false accusations by a complainant is certainly probative on the issue of <em>credibility\u201d </em>and concluded that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b923-6\">\u201cregardless of the prohibitions of OEC 608, the Confrontation Clause of Article I, section 11, requires that the court permit a defendant to cross-examine the complaining witness in front of the jury concerning other accusations she has made if 1) she has recanted them; 2) the defendant demonstrates to the court that those accusations were false; or 3) there is some evidence that the victim has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"902\">*902</page-number>made prior accusations that were false, unless the probative value of the evidence which the defendant seeks to elicit on the cross-examination (including the probability that false accusations were in fact made) is substantially outweighed by the risk of prejudice, confusion, embarrassment or delay.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b924-3\">83 Or App at 129-30 (emphasis added). Therefore, under the third category of <em>LeClair, </em>when there is some evidence that the victim has made a prior false sexual-abuse allegation, the trial court has discretion either to permit or prohibit cross-examination of the victim about the matter after conducting appropriate balancing.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>LeClair </em>evidence is strictly limited to impeachment of the victim on cross-examination. <em>State v. Nelson, </em>246 Or App 91, 102, 265 P3d 8 (2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b924-4\">Generally, an issue not preserved in the trial court will not be considered on appeal. <em>Ailes v. Portland Meadows, Inc., </em>312 Or 376, 380, 823 P2d 956 (1991). \u201c[A] party must provide the trial court with an explanation of his or her objection that is specific enough to ensure that the court can identify its alleged error with enough clarity to permit it to consider and correct the error immediately, if correction is warranted.\u201d <em>Wyatt, </em>331 Or at 343; <em>see also State v. Wideman, </em>203 Or App 359, 364, 124 P3d 1271 (2005) (preservation rules are meant to ensure \u201cthat the position of a party is presented clearly to the trial court and that parties are not taken by surprise, misled, or denied opportunities to meet an argument\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b924-5\">Again, on appeal, defendant asserts that the trial court \u201cviolated his confrontation rights by precluding him from cross-examining [A] about a purportedly false sexual-abuse allegation that she made\u201d against defendant\u2019s wife. Defendant relies solely on the analytical framework laid out in <em>LeClair </em>category three to demonstrate that he \u201cpresented at least some evidence that the allegation was false, and that the trial court erred by excluding the evidence without balancing the probative value against the danger of unfair prejudice.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b925-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"903\">*903</page-number>However, as the state correctly points out, during trial, defendant persistently argued to the trial court that the evidence of A\u2019s allegations against defendant\u2019s wife, including evidence that those allegations were false, was admissible first under OEC 412, and later under OEC 404(2) and (3), to show A\u2019s <em>motive </em>in making false allegations against <em>defendant\u2014i.e., </em>to be allowed to live with her father. In doing so, he repeatedly emphasized the similarity between A\u2019s accusations against defendant and his wife, arguing that that similarity supported admission of the evidence to show OEC 404 <em>motive </em>under \u201csort of a <em>Johns </em>test balancing.\u201d Defense made no mention of the evidence being used to show A\u2019s lack of <em>credibility.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b925-4\">Moreover, defendant expressly rejected the state\u2019s argument that <em>LeClair </em>provided, the appropriate analytic framework for the admission of evidence of A\u2019s allegations against defendant\u2019s wife and rejected the idea that he was limited by <em>LeClair </em>to cross-examination of A about the prior allegations. Instead, defendant argued that he was <em>not </em>limited to cross-examining A about her allegations against defendant\u2019s wife. Indeed, he stated that, \u201cif [A] is permitted to testify to this false allegation[,] *** I\u2019m not left with her response, I have freedom to introduce more specific acts for the purposes of establishing motive.\u201d That argument not only undercuts defendant\u2019s preservation contention\u2014that the parties agreed that the offer of proof fell under the rubric of OEC 608 and LeClair\u2014but also indicates that defendant invited the alleged error of which he now complains on appeal.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>See State v. Kammeyer, </em>226 Or App 210, 214, 203 P3d 274, <em>rev den, </em>346 Or 590 (2009) (\u201cUnder the invited error doctrine, a party who \u2018was actively <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"904\">*904</page-number>instrumental in bringing about\u2019 an alleged error \u2018cannot be heard to complain, and the case ought not to be reversed because of it.\u2019\u201d (Quoting <em>Anderson v. Oregon Railroad Co., </em>45 Or 211, 216-17, 77 P 119 (1904).)).</p>\n<p id=\"b926-4\">In sum, defendant\u2019s arguments below provided the trial court with no reason to believe that it was expected to conduct a <em>LeClair </em>category-three balancing test. In the same way, the court could not have been expected to understand that defendant was seeking only to cross-examine A about her allegations against defendant\u2019s wife, without extrinsic evidence of the falsity of those allegations. Further, the state did not have the opportunity to present its arguments about why the balancing test called for in <em>LeClair </em>would prohibit cross-examination of A about her allegations against defendant\u2019s wife. Consequently, defendant did not preserve in the trial court the error he now asserts on appeal, and we decline to review it.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b920-7\"> Based, in part, on defendant\u2019s conviction in the criminal case, the trial court also found defendant in contempt of court for violating his probation in a restraining order case. Defendant appealed from both the judgment of conviction and the contempt judgment. However, defendant addressed only the criminal proceeding in his brief and at oral argument and, therefore, failed to develop an argument challenging the contempt judgment on appeal. Accordingly, our opinion focuses solely on his criminal convictions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b921-6\"><em> </em>In general, OEC 412 concerns the admissibility of evidence pertaining to a victim\u2019s \u201cpast sexual behavior.\u201d More specifically, OEC 412 provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b921-7\">\u201c(2) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, *** evidence of an alleged victim\u2019s past sexual behavior other than reputation or opinion evidence is also not admissible, unless the evidence other than reputation or opinion evidence:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b921-8\">\u00ab\u215c \u2021\u215c\u2021\u215c</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b921-9\">\u201c(b) Is evidence that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b921-10\">\u201c(A) Relates to the motive or bias of the alleged victim!.]\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b924-6\"> <em>See State v. Arellano, </em>149 Or App 86, 90, 941 P2d 1089 (1997), <em>rev dismissed, </em>327 Or 55 (1998) (\u201c[I]f the evidence of a prior false accusation is within the third category, we review the court\u2019s decision for abuse of discretion.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b925-5\"> Defendant\u2019s misplaced references to <em>Johns, </em>similarity, and motive made it even more difficult for the trial court to understand defendant\u2019s contention. As we have previously explained, the specific test enunciated in Johns\u2014including the issue of similarity and the doctrine of chances\u2014is applicable only when other bad acts evidence is offered to prove intent or absence of mistake. It is not applicable when the evidence is offered for the noncharacter purpose of proving motive. <em>State v. Bracken, </em>174 Or App 294, 300, 23 P3d 417 (2001); <em>see also State v. Tena, </em>281 Or App 57, 70, 384 P3d 521 (2016) (\u201c[A]s explained in <em>[State v. Turnidge (S059155), </em>359 Or 364, 374 P3d 853 (2016)], the <em>Johns </em>analysis applies whenever the evidence is offered to prove \u2018intent,\u2019 specifically in the sense of \u2018absence of mistake or accident,\u2019 under the doctrine of chances. Evidence offered to prove intent by showing the defendant\u2019s motive is not subject to the <em>Johns </em>analysis.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
