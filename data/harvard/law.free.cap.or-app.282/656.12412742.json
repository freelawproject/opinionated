In 2005, defendant wrote a letter to the judge who had presided over his trial requesting, among other things, DNA testing and appointment of counsel. A few weeks later, the judge\u2019s judicial assistant responded to defendant\u2019s letter. The response stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b679-6\">\u201c[Y]ou were found guilty at trial and, after being sentenced to the Department of Corrections, this court no longer has jurisdiction to take action on your requests which include DNA testing, I will see that your correspondence is made part of the court\u2019s file * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b679-7\">In 2013, the Oregon legislature passed Senate Bill (SB) 42 (2013), codified as ORS 138.697, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b679-8\">\u201c(1) A person described in ORS 138.690 may appeal to the Court of Appeals from a circuit court\u2019s final order or judgment denying or limiting DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) testing under ORS 138.692, denying appointment of counsel under ORS 138.694 or denying a motion for a new trial under ORS 138.696.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b679-9\">SB 42 also provided that, \u201cif the circuit court has entered a final order * * * before the effective date of this 2013 Act, a party may appeal to the Court of Appeals * * * not later than 90 days after the effective date of this 2013 Act.\u201d Or Laws 2013, ch 152, \u00a7 2. Defendant timely filed a notice of appeal to this court pursuant to the provisions of SB 42 from the trial court\u2019s 2005 letter. The appellate commissioner granted the trial court leave to enter an appealable order, and it did so on October 30, 2013. The order stated, \u201cFor the reasons expressed in its letter from January 31, 2005, this court took <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>no action [on] defendant\u2019s request for DNA testing because it lacks jurisdiction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b680-4\">On appeal, defendant argues that the trial court erred in dismissing, for lack of jurisdiction, his request for DNA testing and appointment of counsel. The state contends that, although the trial court had jurisdiction to consider a proper motion for DNA testing, it did not have jurisdiction to grant a request that failed to comply with the statutory requirements. We agree with defendant that the trial court had jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-5\">ORS 138.690 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b680-6\">\u201cA person may file in the circuit court in which the judgment of conviction was entered a motion requesting the performance of DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) testing on specific evidence if the person has been convicted of * * * a felony in which DNA evidence could exist and is relevant to establishing an element of the offense.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b680-7\">ORS 138.692 (concerning motion requesting DNA testing)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and ORS 138.694 (relating to appointment of counsel for persons filing motion for DNA testing)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> require supporting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>affidavits before the trial court may reach the merits of a defendant\u2019s motion. Nonetheless, under ORS 138.690, the circuit court in which the judgment of conviction was entered has jurisdiction to consider a defendant\u2019s motion for DNA testing. Furthermore, under ORS 138.694, a person may petition the trial court for the appointment of counsel to assist the person in filing a motion for DNA testing. Here, the trial court did not reach the merits of defendant\u2019s request for DNA testing or appointment of counsel because it dismissed his request for lack of jurisdiction. In other words, the trial court did not consider whether defendant\u2019s letter complied with the statutory requirements of ORS 138.692 and ORS 138.694 before dismissing defendant\u2019s request. Because the trial court had authority under ORS 138.690 to consider defendant\u2019s request, the trial court erred in dismissing defendant\u2019s request for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-4\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b679-10\"> ORS 138.690 to 138.697 have been amended since defendant petitioned the trial court for DNA testing and appointment of counsel; however, because those amendments do not affect our analysis, we refer to the current version of the statute in this opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b680-8\"> ORS 138.692 provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b680-9\">\u201c(l)(a) When a person files a motion under ORS 138.690 requesting the performance of DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) testing on evidence, the motion must be supported by an affidavit.
