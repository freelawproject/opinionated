J.</author>\n<p id=\"b127-3\">This appeal requires us to decide whether we have appellate jurisdiction and, if so, whether defendant\u2019s claim of sentencing error is subject to appellate review. The appeal arises from a judgment revoking defendant\u2019s probation and sentencing her to 80 months\u2019 incarceration. Defendant stipulated to that sentence in her plea agreement, but assigns error to it, contending that it is longer than the 25-26 month sentence authorized by the sentencing guidelines for a probation revocation sentence and that, notwithstanding her stipulation, the trial court lacked authority to impose it. In response, the state contends that ORS 138.222(7), which defendant invokes as our source of jurisdiction, does not confer appellate jurisdiction, requiring dismissal of this appeal. Alternatively, the state argues that, even if we have jurisdiction, ORS 138.222(2)(d) bars our review of defendant\u2019s sole claim of error. We conclude that we have jurisdiction over this appeal pursuant to ORS 138.222(7), but that ORS 138.222(2)(d) precludes review of defendant\u2019s sole assignment of error. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-4\">The facts pertinent to our decision are primarily procedural and not disputed. Defendant was charged with three heroin-related felonies: unlawful delivery of heroin within 1,000 feet of a school, ORS 475.852 (Count 1); delivery of heroin, ORS 475.850 (Count 2); and possession of heroin, ORS 475.854 (Count 3). Before trial, the state gave notice that it intended to prove sentence enhancement facts at trial. However, the parties ultimately entered into a plea agreement under which defendant agreed to plead guilty to Count 1 in exchange for the state\u2019s agreement to dismiss Counts 2 and 3. The terms of that agreement required the parties to stipulate jointly to a recommended \u201cdownward dispositional sentence\u201d of 36 months\u2019 probation which, if revoked, would result in defendant serving an upward dura-tional departure sentence of 80 months\u2019 incarceration:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-5\">\u201cDefendant stipulates that, if probation is revoked, she shall be sentenced to an UPWARD DEPARTURE SENTENCE of eighty (80) months prison, with NO SB 936, with thirty-six (36) months Post Prison Supervision.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b128-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>The trial court accepted defendant\u2019s plea and the parties\u2019 stipulated sentence, and entered a judgment of conviction on Count 1 that sentenced defendant to probation. That judgment includes defendant\u2019s stipulation to the 80-month sentence upon revocation of probation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b128-4\">\u201cIT IS FURTHER ORDERED AND ADJUDGED that: The defendant stipulates that if this probation is revoked, she SHALL be sentenced to an upward departure sentence of 80 months prison with no 936 and 36 months post-prison supervision.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">Defendant was not successful in complying with the terms of her probation, and the trial court thus revoked it. Notwithstanding her stipulation, defendant argued that the trial court could not impose the 80-month sentence because that sentence exceeded the presumptive maximum sentence under the guidelines for a probation revocation sentence under the circumstances of this case. The trial court rejected that argument, imposed the 80-month sentence to which defendant had stipulated, and defendant now appeals the court\u2019s probation revocation judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-6\">On appeal, defendant\u2019s sole claim of error is that the trial court erred by imposing the 80-month sentence to which she had stipulated because, in her view, it exceeds the maximum sentence that would be authorized under the sentencing guidelines. As for her stipulation, defendant contends that, as a matter of law, a trial court lacks authority to impose a sentence that exceeds what would be authorized under applicable guidelines or statutes, even if a defendant agrees to the sentence. As noted, the state contends that ORS 138.222(7) bars our exercise of jurisdiction over this appeal altogether or, alternatively, that ORS 138.222(2)(d) bars review of defendant\u2019s sole claim of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-7\">JURISDICTION</p>\n<p id=\"b128-8\">Defendant invokes ORS 138.222(7) as the source of our jurisdiction over this appeal. That provision states, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b128-9\">\u201c(7) Either the state or the defendant may appeal a judgment of conviction based on the sentence for a felony committed on or after November 1, 1989, to the Court of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>Appeals subject to the limitations of chapter 790, Oregon Laws 1989. The defendant may appeal under this subsection only upon showing a colorable claim of error in a proceeding if the appeal is from a proceeding in which:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A_L\">\u201c(a) A sentence was entered subsequent to a plea of guilty or no contest;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b129-5\">\u201c(b) Probation was revoked, the period of probation was extended, a new condition of probation was imposed, an existing condition of probation was modified or a sentence suspension was revoked; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b129-6\">\u201c(c) A sentence was entered subsequent to a resentenc-ing ordered by an appellate court or a post-conviction relief court.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b129-7\">The state disputes that ORS 138.222(7) confers jurisdiction and argues that this appeal should be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. The state advances two arguments as to why that is so. First, the state contends that the judgment in this case does not qualify as a \u201cjudgment of conviction <em>based on the </em>sentence\u201d because, in the state\u2019s view, a probation revocation sanction is not a \u201csentence\u201d for purposes of ORS 138.222. Second, the state notes that this appeal is from a probation revocation proceeding and that, as a result, ORS 138.222(7) requires that defendant make \u201ca colorable claim of error in [the] proceeding\u201d below in order to pursue this appeal. Foreshadowing its next argument\u2014 and somewhat circularly\u2014the state argues that defendant\u2019s sole claim of error is not reviewable on appeal by operation of ORS 138.222(2)(d) and that, therefore, defendant has not shown \u201ca colorable claim of error\u201d in the proceeding below.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-8\">The state\u2019s first argument\u2014that the judgment at issue is not a \u201cjudgment of conviction based on the sentence for a felony\u201d\u2014is foreclosed by our recent decisions in <em>State v. Orcutt, </em>280 Or App 439, 443 n 5, 380 P3d 1105 (2016), and <em>State v. Johnson, </em>271 Or App 272, 275, 350 P3d 556 (2015). In <em>Orcutt, </em>for example, we rejected an argument identical to the one the state makes here. We explained that, under the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>State v. Lane, </em>357 Or 619, 630, 355 P3d 914 (2015), a judgment imposing a probation revocation sanction in a felony case is a \u201cjudgment of conviction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>based on a sentence\u201d for purposes of ORS 138.222(7), so as to make such a judgment appealable under that provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-4\">As to the state\u2019s second argument, the state does not appear to dispute that, but for the potential impediment to reviewability, defendant\u2019s appeal raises a colorable claim of error. That is, the state does not argue that defendant\u2019s claim of error is not a \u201cplausible\u201d one, given the facts of the proceeding below and current state of the law. <em>See State ex rel Dept. of Human Services v. Rardin, </em>338 Or 399, 406-08, 110 P3d 580 (2005) (construing the nearly identical \u201ccolorable claim of error\u201d standard as used in ORS 419A.200(5)(a)(A) to mean \u201ca claim that a party reasonably may assert under current law and that is plausible given the facts and the current law (or a reasonable extension or modification of current law)\u201d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Instead, the state\u2019s sole argument is that defendant\u2019s claim is not \u201ccolorable claim of error\u201d because it is not a reviewable one, regardless of its potential merit. In other words, as we understand the state\u2019s argument, the state is contending that, to invoke our jurisdiction under ORS 138.222(7), a defendant must demonstrate not only a plausible claim that an error occurred in the proceeding below, but also that that claim of error, ultimately, is one that is reviewable.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">We disagree for two reasons. First, the plain terms of ORS 138.222(7) require a defendant to make a \u201cshowing [of] a colorable claim of error in [the] proceeding\u201d from which the appeal arises. That wording suggests that the focus of the required \u201cshowing\u201d is on what happened below in the trial court, and not on whether any identified error will be reviewable in this court under applicable rules of reviewability.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-6\">Second, when the legislature has intended to require an appellant to make a threshold showing of reviewability, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>in addition to a showing of some potentially meritorious claim of error, it has provided a more explicit indication of that intention than it has in ORS 138.222. For example, <em>former </em>ORS 144.335(6) (2001), <em>repealed by </em>Or Laws 2007, ch 411, \u00a7 1, required a person seeking judicial review of a decision of the parole board to make a threshold \u201cshowing in [a] motion that a substantial question of law <em>is presented for review\u201d </em>to obtain judicial review of the board\u2019s decision. (Emphasis added.) Construing the emphasized wording, the Supreme Court concluded that by requiring a showing that a question was <em>\u201cpresented </em>for review\u201d the legislature intended to require a showing that the question raised not only had potential legal merit but was one that, as a procedural matter, was \u201ccapable of adjudication\u201d in the case, in addition to having potential substantive merit. <em>Atkinson v. Board of Parole, </em>341 Or 382, 390, 143 P3d 538 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b131-3\">ORS 138.222(7), by contrast, does not contain similar wording requiring a defendant to show that a \u201ccolorable claim of error in a proceeding\u201d below is in fact \u201cpresented\u201d for this court\u2019s review; it simply requires a defendant to show a colorable claim of error in the proceeding below. From the omission of such a \u201cpresentation\u201d requirement, we infer that the legislature did not intend to require a defendant to demonstrate that the identified claim of error is reviewable in order to invoke the court\u2019s appellate jurisdiction under ORS 138.222(7). An appellant need only make a plausible showing that the trial court erred.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-4\">Our conclusion, of course, does not mean that an appellant is relieved of the obligation to demonstrate that any claimed error is, in fact, reviewable. An appellant necessarily must do so to obtain review of the merits of any asserted claim of error. It simply means that an appellant need not do so at the outset of an appeal to establish that we have jurisdiction under ORS 138.222(7). For that reason, we reject the state\u2019s argument that we lack jurisdiction over this appeal and decline its request to dismiss.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b132-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>REVIEWABILITY</p>\n<p id=\"b132-4\">Having concluded that we have jurisdiction over this appeal, the next question is whether defendant\u2019s claim of error is reviewable. We conclude that it is not. In particular, we conclude, as the state argues, that ORS 138.222(2)(d) precludes our review of defendant\u2019s claim that the trial court was not authorized to sentence her to the sentence to which she stipulated upon revocation of her probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">ORS 138.222(2) states, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-6\">\u201c(2) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (4)(c) of this section, on appeal from a judgment of conviction entered for a felony committed on or after November 1, 1989, the appellate court may not review:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-7\">\u00ab5j\u00ed \u2021\u215c\u2021\u2021</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-8\">\u201c(d) Any sentence resulting from a stipulated sentencing agreement between the state and the defendant which the sentencing court approves on the record.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b132-9\">By its terms, that provision precludes review of defendant\u2019s claim that her probation revocation sentence is unlawful if two conditions are satisfied. First, this must be an appeal from a judgment that qualifies as \u201ca judgment of conviction\u201d under ORS 138.222. Second, defendant\u2019s probation revocation sentence must be one \u201cresulting from a stipulated sentencing agreement which the sentencing court approves on the record.\u201d Defendant argues that neither condition is satisfied. We conclude otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-10\">As to whether this is an appeal from a \u201cjudgment of conviction\u201d within the meaning of ORS 138.222(2), defendant argues that it is not, because it is a probation-revocation judgment. However, in concluding that we have appellate jurisdiction pursuant to ORS 138.222(7), we determined, consistently with <em>Orcutt </em>and <em>Johnson, </em>that a probation-revocation judgment qualifies as a \u201cjudgment of conviction based on [a] sentence for a felony\u201d for purposes of that section of ORS 138.222. The legislature enacted the pertinent wording of ORS 138.222(2) and ORS 138.222(7) at the same time. Or Laws 1989, ch 790, \u00a7 21. Under those circumstances, we infer that the phrase \u201cjudgment of conviction\u201d in ORS 138.222(7) has the same meaning as the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>phrase \u201cjudgment of conviction\u201d in ORS 138.222(2). We do so because the Supreme Court has instructed that \u201c[w]hen the legislature uses the identical phrase in related statutory provisions that were enacted as the part of the same law, we interpret the phrase to have the same meaning in both sections.\u201d <em>Tharp v. PSRB, </em>338 Or 413, 422, 110 P3d 103 (2005). In other words, if a judgment is a \u201cjudgment of conviction\u201d for purposes of ORS 138.222(7), it also is a \u201cjudgment of conviction\u201d for purposes of ORS 138.222(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b133-4\">The next issue is whether defendant\u2019s sentence is one that resulted from \u201ca stipulated sentencing agreement * * * which the sentencing court approves on the record.\u201d In arguing that it is not, defendant relies on the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>State v. Kephart, </em>320 Or 433, 445, 887 P2d 774 (1994). In particular, defendant points to the <em>Kephart </em>court\u2019s conclusion that ORS 138.222(2)(d) does not bar review of sentences \u201cunless they [are] \u2018stipulated sentences\u2019 <em>as illustrated in ORS 135.407.\u201d</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark><em> Kephart, </em>320 Or at 447 (emphasis <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>added). Defendant contends that the 80-month sentence to which she stipulated is not one that is \u201cillustrated\u201d by ORS 135.407 because, in her view, it is not authorized by ORS 135.407. It is not authorized, defendant asserts, because ORS 135.407 does not explicitly permit a person to stipulate to a future sentence upon probation revocation and also because ORS 135.407 requires a sentence to comport with the guidelines and, in defendant\u2019s view, her stipulated sentence is not permitted by the guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-4\">Defendant\u2019s argument, although a plausible reading of <em>Kephart, </em>rests on an overly rigid reading of that case, a reading that we previously have rejected. We assume without deciding that defendant is right that her sentence does not comport with\u2014or is not one that is authorized by\u2014 ORS 135.407. Nonetheless, under our decision in <em>State v. Upton, </em>132 Or App 579, 583, 889 P2d 376, <em>rev den, </em>320 Or 749 (1995), defendant\u2019s stipulation to a future sentence upon probation revocation is, in the words of <em>Kephart, </em>a stipulated sentence that is \u201cillustrated in\u201d ORS 135.407.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">In <em>Upton, </em>we considered whether the defendant\u2019s stipulated sentence to life in prison without possibility of parole\u2014a sentence that was not covered by the terms of ORS 135.407\u2014was nonetheless the type of sentence \u201cillustrated in\u201d that statute under <em>Kephart. Upton, </em>132 Or App at 583-84. We concluded that it was, reasoning that any stipulated sentence that bears the hallmarks of the stipulated sentences listed in ORS 135.407 is one that is \u201cillustrated in\u201d that statute. <em>Id. </em>at 583-84. In particular, we concluded that, when a stipulated sentence is imposed pursuant to an agreement that relates to sentencing and that \u201cit set the specific sentence to be imposed\u201d-\u2014and the court, in fact, imposes the sentence contemplated in the agreement\u2014the sentence is one that is \u201cillustrated in\u201d ORS 135.407 under <em>Kephart, </em>and for which ORS 138.222(2)(d) bars review. <em>Id.; see Blackledge v. Morrow, </em>174 Or App 566, 571, 26 P3d 851, <em>rev den, </em>332 Or 558 (2001) (under <em>Upton </em>and <em>Kephart, </em>ORS <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>138.222(2)(d) bars appellate review of a sentence imposed where the parties\u2019 agreement sets the specific sentence and the trial court imposes that sentence). In reaching that conclusion, we noted that the legislative history of ORS 138.222(2)(d) indicated, as the plain words of the provision suggest, that the legislature intended to preclude review of any sentence to which the defendant had agreed \u201c\u2018ahead of time.\u2019\u201d 132 Or App at 584 (quoting <em>Kephart, </em>320 Or at 445). We further deemed it \u201cinconceivable,\u201d in view of that history, that the legislature intended to allow review of a stipulated sentence, where the defendant agreed upon the specific sentence, and the trial court imposed that specific sentence, simply because the agreed-upon sentence was not expressly contemplated by ORS 135.407. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b135-4\">Here, defendant\u2019s stipulated sentence has the <em>Upton </em>hallmarks of a sentence \u201cillustrated in\u201d ORS 135.407. It was imposed pursuant to agreement, it is a specific sentence, and the trial court imposed that agreed-upon specific sentence. Therefore, under <em>Upton, </em>defendant\u2019s stipulated sentence is one that is \u201cillustrated in\u201d ORS 135.407 and, thus, ORS 138.222(2)(d) bars our review of defendant\u2019s claim that that agreed-upon sentence is unlawful. Accordingly, because defendant\u2019s sole claim of error is not reviewable, we affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">Motion to dismiss denied; affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b130-7\"> The state has not argued that the legislature intended the phrase \u201ccolor-able claim of error\u201d in ORS 138.222 to have a different meaning than it does in the other statutes in which it appears. In <em>Rardin, </em>the Supreme Court interpreted the phrase to mean \u201ca claim that a party reasonably may assert under current law and that is plausible given the facts and the current law (or a reasonable extension or modification of current law).\u201d 338 Or at 408. We previously have applied the <em>Rardin </em>definition of the standard to ORS 138.222(7). <em>State v. Hikes, </em>261 Or App 30, 34, 323 P3d 298, <em>rev den, 355 </em>Or 380 (2014).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b131-5\"> In addition to raising that argument in its brief, the state also raised the argument by way of motion to dismiss. By order of the chief judge, that motion was referred to this department.
