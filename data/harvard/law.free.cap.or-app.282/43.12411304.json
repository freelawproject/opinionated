Bull Mountain is the developer of a residential subdivision and requested relocation of the utility poles in order to make street improvements along an adjacent public road\u2014 improvements that Washington County was requiring Bull Mountain to make as a condition of obtaining land use approval for the subdivision development. Bull Mountain\u2019s complaint against Frontier alleged, among other contentions, that it was acting as the agent of a \u201cpublic body\u201d when it requested relocation of Frontier\u2019s utilities, and was, therefore, exempt under the terms of Frontier\u2019s tariff from the obligation to pay for the relocation.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-5\">We review orders of the PUC to determine whether that body correctly applied the applicable law, whether there is substantial evidence to support its findings, and whether it acted within the scope of its discretion. ORS 756.610(1); ORS 183.482(8). We write to address Bull Mountain\u2019s argument that the PUC erred in rejecting Bull Mountain\u2019s contention that it was acting as the agent of a \u201cpublic body\u201d when requesting that Frontier move the utility poles, and we affirm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b67-6\">We draw the largely undisputed facts from the PUC\u2019s order. Bull Mountain is the developer of a 14-lot single family residential subdivision on SW Bull Mountain Road in Washington County. The county has designated SW Bull Mountain Road to be a \u201ccollector street\u201d in its transportation system plan, but the county has not yet widened the road to \u201ccollector street\u201d status. When Bull Mountain sought a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>development permit for its subdivision, the county required, as a condition of approval, that Bull Mountain improve half of the adjacent segment of SW Bull Mountain Road to \u201ccollector\u201d street standards. Those requirements included dedicating additional right-of-way to permit a wider road and to make the improvements along that additional right-of-way, such as adding \u201ccurb and gutter, storm drainage, concrete sidewalk, planter strip and continuous roadway illumination.\u201d In order to make the required improvements, Bull Mountain requested that Frontier move existing poles, cables, and in-ground fiber-optic facilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-3\">The compensation that a telecommunications utility may charge for services is strictly governed by the utility\u2019s approved rate schedule, or tariff. ORS 759.260(1). Frontier\u2019s tariff that was in effect at the relevant time specified that, when utility facilities were relocated at the request of a customer or \u201cthird-party,\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b68-4\">\u201cthe entire cost of removing the old and construing the new will be borne by the applicant/customer or others requesting the relocation. Payment for the cost of the change or relocation must be made prior to the change or relocation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b68-5\">The tariff provided in a footnote, however, that \u201c[a] third-party request does not include a \u2018Public Body\u2019 as defined in [ORS 174.109].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b68-6\">When Bull Mountain requested relocation of the utilities, Frontier demanded advance payment. Bull Mountain declined, asserting that it was acting as an agent for Washington County and was, thus, a \u201cpublic body\u201d within the meaning of the tariffs exemption. Frontier disagreed, and Bull Mountain filed this proceeding with the PUC to resolve the dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-7\">Citing the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Vaughn v. First Transit, Inc., </em>346 Or 128, 135, 206 P3d 181 (2009), the PUC identified two requirements for the existence of an agency relationship: \u201c(1) a manifestation by the principal to the agent that the agent may act on his account, and consent by the agent to so act; and (2) the agent must be subject to the principal\u2019s control.\u201d <em>See Vaughn, </em>346 Or at 135 (\u201cAt common law, \u2018agency\u2019 was defined as a relationship <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>that \u2018results from the manifestation of consent by one person to another that the other shall act <em>on behalf and subject to his control, </em>and consent by the other so to act.\u2019\u201d (Quoting <em>Hampton Tree Farms, Inc. v. Jewett, </em>320 Or 599, 617, 892 P2d 683 (1995) (emphasis in <em>Vaughn)). </em>The PUC evaluated Bull Mountain\u2019s claim of agency under the two-part standard that it described and found that neither condition had been met:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b69-4\">\u201cBull Mountain offered no evidence that Washington County intended that Bull Mountain was acting on its behalf when it undertook to widen the street. The street widening was a condition of Bull Mountain\u2019s permit. Bull Mountain was acting on its own behalf when it widened the street, even though the street widening was for the benefit of the county. Similarly, Bull Mountain offered no evidence that it was under the control of the county when it undertook the street widening. Again, the street widening was a condition of Bull Mountain\u2019s permit. If Bull Mountain had decided not to proceed with its subdivision it would not have had to widen the street.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b69-5\">On review, Bull Mountain renews its argument that it qualifies as an agent of Washington County and, therefore, qualifies as a \u201cpublic body\u201d within the meaning of the tariffs exemption from charges for the cost of moving the utility poles. Bull Mountain does not challenge the common law agency test under which the PUC evaluated its \u201cpublic body\u201d claim. Rather, it contends that the PUC\u2019s determination is \u201cpremised on erroneous factual assumptions that ignore substantial evidence in the record.\u201d Thus, we consider whether the PUC\u2019s decision that Bull Mountain was not acting as Washington County\u2019s agent is supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-6\">We conclude that the record supports the PUC\u2019s determination that Bull Mountain failed to establish the first prong of an agency relationship\u2014that the county manifested to Bull Mountain that Bull Mountain was acting on the county\u2019s behalf\u2014and, therefore, affirm without deciding whether Bull Mountain established the type of \u201ccontrol\u201d necessary to make it the county\u2019s agent. As <em>Vaughn </em>indicates, the consent to an agency relationship must be mutual. 346 Or at 135. The principal\u2019s consent to an agency relationship <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>may be shown by an express agreement or it may be implied from the circumstances and from conduct of the parties. <em>Eads v. Borman, </em>351 Or 729, 736, 277 P3d 503 (2012).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b70-3\">Here, there is no evidence of an express agreement that Bull Mountain would act as the county\u2019s agent, such as a contract between it and Washington County, but Bull Mountain argues that consent to such an arrangement can be implied from other evidence. Bull Mountain relies on a letter that the county sent to Frontier regarding another subdivision development along SW Bull Mountain Road. The letter explained the county\u2019s position that, under Oregon law, a utility is required to relocate its facilities within the county\u2019s right-of-way \u201cat the utility\u2019s expense when in conflict with public improvements\u201d and that, \u201cwhen constructing public improvements, the developers are doing them under our direction, which is covered by\u201d the described law.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Petitioner also relies on an affidavit of an assistant county counsel stating that the county engineer\u2019s letter \u201caccurately states the county\u2019s position\u201d on petitioner\u2019s subdivision as well. The affidavit further stated that, when the county requests that a utility relocate its facilities for a public improvement, the utility pays the costs pursuant to ORS 758.010 to 758.025 (setting forth requirements for locating and relocating utility facilities within public rights of way).</p>\n<p id=\"b70-4\">Petitioner interprets those statements from the county as expressing the county\u2019s intention that petitioner <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>would act on behalf of the county when making the required improvements, but the PUC did not err in finding otherwise. There is no evidence that Washington County sent a similar letter to Frontier regarding Bull Mountain\u2019s development or in any way communicated to Frontier that Bull Mountain\u2019s relocation request was made on behalf of the county. The statement by the assistant county counsel that the letter regarding the other development reflects \u201cthe county\u2019s position\u201d on Bull Mountain\u2019s development may mean that the county agrees with Bull Mountain that Frontier should move the utility poles without charge. But that falls short of establishing, as a matter beyond factual dispute, that the county was manifesting consent that Bull Mountain act on the county\u2019s behalf by developing the property or when improving the right-of-way or when it made the relocation request.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-4\">Nor do the circumstances of Bull Mountain\u2019s request necessarily imply that it was acting on the county\u2019s behalf by mutual consent. Although the county had established a transportation plan that designated SW Bull Mountain Road for the kind of road widening and improvement that Bull Mountain\u2019s improvements along the right-of-way would permit, there is no evidence that the county was implementing that designation. Specifically, there is no evidence about when\u2014if ever\u2014the county would make use of the improvements it had required as a condition of subdivision approval. Rather, there is simply evidence that the county chose to require developers to make\u2014at the time of development\u2014 the half-road dedications and improvements that would ultimately be necessary if the county improves SW Bull Mountain Road to a \u201ccollector street\u201d at some point in the future. Although it is undisputed that petitioner\u2019s widening of SW Bull Mountain Road as a condition for the development inured to the benefit of the county, that does not establish that the county manifested consent that Bull Mountain act on the county\u2019s behalf. Bull Mountain requested relocation of Frontier\u2019s utility services in order to make improvements that were a condition for approval of its development of the subdivision. The PUC did not err in determining that the county did not manifest consent that Bull Mountain act on behalf of the county in making those improvements and, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>therefore, that Bull Mountain was not acting as a \u201cpublic body\u201d when it asked Frontier to move the utility poles.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-3\">There is no dispute that, if Bull Mountain was not acting as the agent of Washington County, then the terms of Frontier\u2019s tariff required it to pay for the cost of relocating the utility services. <em>See </em>ORS 756.565 (\u201cAll rates, tariffs, * * * approved or prescribed by the Public Utility Commission * * * shall be in force and shall be prima facie lawful and reasonable.\u201d). Thus, the PUC did not err in rejecting petitioner\u2019s contention that it could not be required under the tariff to pay the relocation costs and in dismissing the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b67-7\"> In addition to challenging the PUC\u2019s determination regarding the \u201cpublic body\u201d tariff exemption, Bull Mountain also assigns error to the PUC\u2019s rejection of Bull Mountain\u2019s alternative arguments: that Frontier\u2019s charge was a prohibited \u201cunjust and unreasonable exaction\u201d and that Frontier\u2019s charge constituted a \u201ctaking\u201d under the state and federal constitutions. We reject those alternative assignments of error without written discussion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b70-5\"> When a case concerns a principal\u2019s liability to a third party for the agent\u2019s acts, the plaintiff may be able to establish an agent\u2019s authority by showing that the principal created the appearance of consent to the agency relationship, <em>i.e., </em>based on the agent\u2019s \u201capparent authority.\u201d <em>See Eads, </em>351 Or at 736; <em>Badger v.
