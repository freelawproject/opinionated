He alleged several wage-violation claims, seeking damages and statutory penalties. After a jury trial and bench trial, defendant appeals a general judgment that awarded plaintiff and other class members $110,030 in damages, $2,439,266 in statutory penalties, and $1,144,058 in prejudgment interest on the damages and statutory penalties. Defendant also appeals a supplemental judgment that, in addition to other things, awarded $4,249,665.49 in attorney fees to plaintiff. As relevant on appeal, plaintiffs wage-violation claims are (1) that current and former employees were not paid for the time they worked off the clock (the off-the-clock claims), and (2) that defendant failed to timely provide final wages upon termination of employment (the final-wages claim). Plaintiff cross-appeals, challenging the trial court\u2019s rulings concerning a meal-break claim and the court\u2019s failure to award additional civil penalties.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-6\">Defendant raises nine assignments of error. In its first assignment, defendant contends that the trial court erred when it certified the classes and denied defendant\u2019s two motions to decertify the classes. As we explain in this opinion, we reject defendant\u2019s challenge to class certification as to the off-the-clock claims on the merits and its certification challenge to the final-wages claims because its arguments on appeal were not preserved.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-7\">In defendant\u2019s third and fourth assignments of error, defendant challenges civil penalties that the trial court imposed under ORS 652.150 and ORS 653.055. Those assignments contend that, as to the off-the-clock claims, the court erred in awarding civil penalties in an amount of $2,348,791 without a jury finding that defendant willfully failed to pay unpaid wages. For the reasons we explain below, we agree with defendant that a finding of willfulness was required for the court to impose civil penalties for the off-the-clock claims. Accordingly, we reverse and remand the general judgment on that basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"777\">*777</page-number>Defendant\u2019s second, fifth, sixth, eighth, and ninth assignments of error also concern the civil penalties imposed.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Defendant\u2019s second assignment asserts that the trial court was not authorized to impose $862,894 in civil penalties, prejudgment interest, and attorney fees after tolling the statutory limitations period for civil penalties under ORCP 32 N by way of another action filed against defendant (the <em>Joarnt </em>action).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> That assignment fails to comply with ORAP 5.45, and we decline to review it. As to defendant\u2019s fifth assignment, challenging prejudgment interest on the penalties, we reject it without written discussion. Defendant\u2019s eighth and ninth assignments claim as error the trial court\u2019s denial on procedural grounds of defendant\u2019s prejudgment and postjudgment motions challenging the penalties imposed. Our reversal of the penalties as to the off-the-clock claims also obviates the need to address much of what was challenged in those motions, but to the extent that the motions raised arguments regarding the final-wages claim, namely additional penalties tolled due to the filing of the <em>Joarnt </em>action, we conclude that the trial court\u2019s denials of the motions on procedural grounds were not made in error.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-4\">In its seventh assignment of error, defendant appeals the supplemental judgment, disputing the statutory bases for plaintiffs entitlement to the award of attorney fees and contending that the trial court exceeded its discretion by applying a \u201cfee multiplier enhancement\u201d to the attorney fee. Our reversal of the general judgment necessitates the reversal and remand of the supplemental judgment, ORS 20.220(3), but we nevertheless address some of the issues <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"778\">*778</page-number>defendant raises in its seventh assignment because those issues are likely to arise on remand.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b800-4\">Plaintiffs cross-appeal raises several assignments of error\u2014all of which we reject without written discussion. That disposition obviates our need to address defendant\u2019s cross-assignment of error on cross-appeal. Accordingly, we affirm on cross-appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-5\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b800-6\">To provide general context for the assignments of error, we outline the procedural history of this case. We provide more detail later in our discussion of each individual assignment. In November 2007, plaintiff filed this action on behalf of himself and current and former employees of defendant, in which he alleged wage and hour violations. As relevant on appeal, plaintiff alleged, among other claims, that employees were required to work off the clock (the off-the-clock claims) and that defendant would not timely pay final wages as required by ORS 652.140 (the final-wages claim). Plaintiff sought class certification, and, in March 2009, the court certified the off-the-clock class and the final-wages class.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-7\">The claims proceeded to trial in January 2010. In addition to his final-wages claim, plaintiff sought to prove that, as to his off-the-clock claims, wages were owed for (1) the time employees spent between disarming the alarm at a store\u2019s entrance and clocking in, (2) the time spent between clocking out and setting the alarm, and (3) the time spent traveling between defendant\u2019s stores to deliver parts or work another shift. The parties disputed whether the jury was required to find that defendant willfully violated the wage and hour laws as to the off-the-clock claims in order to impose civil penalties under ORS 652.140, ORS 652.150, and ORS 653.055. The trial court sided with plaintiff, deciding that a finding of willfulness applied only to the final-wages <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"779\">*779</page-number>claim and reserved the imposition of civil penalties as to the off-the-clock claims as a matter to be determined by the court. The jury returned a verdict against defendant as to the off-the-clock claims and the final-wages claim, awarding $110,030 in damages. In April 2010, the court held a bench trial in which it determined civil penalties in the amount of $2,439,266. In September 2011, defendant filed two motions: the first to reduce the civil penalties, arguing that the penalties exceeded what was permissible under federal due process, and the second, an alternative ORCP 64 motion for a new trial. The court denied those motions on substantive and procedural grounds. After the court entered a general judgment in November 2011, defendant renewed the arguments it had made before judgment by means of another ORCP 64 motion for a new trial along with an ORCP 63 motion for a judgment notwithstanding the verdict. Those motions were denied in February 2012.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-4\">In June 2012, plaintiff filed a supplemental fee petition under ORCP 68. After discovery and a hearing, the trial court awarded attorney fees. The court determined that plaintiff was entitled under ORS 652.200 and ORS 653.055 to more than $2.2 million in fees. The trial court found, in part, that, because of the \u201crisks involved\u201d and the \u201cexcellent results\u201d obtained by plaintiffs counsel, a \u201cmultiplier enhancement\u201d to double the lodestar fee was appropriate, resulting in a fee award of more than $4.4 million.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-5\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b801-6\">A. <em>Certification</em></p>\n<p id=\"b801-7\">We begin with defendant\u2019s first assignment of error in which it contends that the trial court erred by certifying, and then declining to decertify, the off-the-clock class and the final-wages class. The assignment concerns three rulings: (1) the pretrial order granting certification; (2) the order denying defendant\u2019s motion to decertify the class, which was made at the end of the trial; and (3) the order denying defendant\u2019s renewed motion to decertify the class, which was made well after the trial. Defendant advances three arguments as to why the court erred: (1) class certification lacked adequate proof of commonality, ORCP 32 A(2); (2) a class action was not superior to other methods <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"780\">*780</page-number>of adjudicating the claims of the class members, namely, common issues did not predominate over individual ones, ORCP 32 B(3); and (3) class certification violated its federal due process rights. For the reasons discussed below, we reject defendant\u2019s challenges. We first set out the relevant procedural background and then discuss the pretrial certification and the post-trial denial of defendant\u2019s motion to decertify. Finally, we discuss defendant\u2019s end-of-trial motion to decertify.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-3\">Before trial, plaintiff moved to certify three classes, which the trial court granted, determining that the classes met all of the requirements of ORCP 32, and as pertinent on appeal, that there were common questions of law or fact, ORCP 32 A(2). Those questions were, as to the final-wages class, whether defendant \u201csystematically failed to pay Plaintiff and all putative class members their final wages when due,\u201d in violation of ORS 652.240 and, as to the off-the-clock class, whether defendant\u2019s policies and practices \u201csuffered and permitted\u201d employees to work before clocking in and out and whether employees were required to travel between stores without compensation. Each question asked whether such practices resulted in unpaid wages and minimum wage and overtime violations.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-4\">The trial court, in its class action certification order, also determined that, under ORCP 32 B, class action litigation was superior to litigating the claims by other available methods for the following reasons: (1) \u201c[pjrosecution of hundreds of separate, individual cases of the same or similar claims is impractical, and would undermine the mandate of ORCP 1 B and general motions of judicial economy\u201d; (2) \u201ccommon questions of law and/or fact predominate over individual questions\u201d for each proposed class; (3) \u201c[flew reasons exist to cause an individual to desire control of the prosecution of their case\u201d; (4) \u201cMultnomah County is a desirable location to concentrate the litigation\u201d; and (5) the \u201cclasses proposed are manageable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b802-5\">On February 2, 2010, defendant moved to decertify the classes. The trial court denied the motion, concluding, \u201c[N]othing persuades me that the initial certification of the class should be changed.\u201d The next day, the class claims <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"781\">*781</page-number>were submitted to the jury, which found that the class members were not timely paid final wages and that they were unpaid for off-the-clock work. On September 20, 2011, defendant renewed its motion to decertify, contending that certification violated its due process rights, based on \u201cnew case authority,\u201d namely, <em>Wal-Mart, Inc. v. Dukes, </em>564 US 338, 131 S Ct 2541, 180 L Ed 2d 374 (2011). The court denied that motion because defendant\u2019s arguments were \u201cnot supported by the factual record in this case or by Oregon law.\u201d The court added that <em>\u201cWal-Mart </em>is distinguishable and otherwise not controlling authority.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b803-4\">1. <em>Certification under ORCP 32 and standards of review</em></p>\n<p id=\"b803-5\">Commonality is one of five initial requirements for class certification\u2014numerosity, commonality, typicality, adequacy, and notice\u2014all of which must be satisfied. ORCP 32 A; ORCP 32 B; <em>see Pearson v. Philip Morris, Inc., </em>358 Or 88, 106, 361 P3d 3 (2015) (\u201cIf any one of the five requirements is not satisfied, the case cannot go forward as a class action\u201d). Of those initial requirements, defendant challenges only commonality, ORCP 32 A(2). That subsection provides for class certification if there are \u201cquestions of law or fact common to the class.\u201d We review a trial court\u2019s commonality determination for legal error \u201cbased on the record before the trial court and the trial court\u2019s findings, if any.\u201d <em>Delgado v. Del Monte Fresh Produce, N. A., Inc., </em>260 Or App 480, 489, 317 P3d 419 (2014) (internal quotation marks omitted). Our review of commonality</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b803-6\">\u201casks only if <em>there are </em>questions of law or fact common to the class. ORCP 32 A(2). It does not test how central the common questions are to the resolution of the action. Nor does it take into account the nature of the proof required to litigate those common issues.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b803-7\"><em>Pearson, </em>358 Or at 109-10 (emphasis in original). We have said that to satisfy the commonality requirement for class certification, we \u201clook at whether the claimed common issues are susceptible to and appropriate for proof of common evidence.\u201d <em>Delgado, </em>260 Or App at 491.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-8\">In addition to satisfying the initial requirements of ORCP 32 A, the court, as set out in ORCP 32 B, must also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"782\">*782</page-number>find that a \u201cclass action is <em>superior </em>to other available methods for the fair and efficient adjudication of the controversy.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Predominance is one of eight factors for determining superiority under ORCP 32 B for which it must be determined to what extent \u201cquestions of law or fact common to the members of the class predominate over any questions affecting only individual members.\u201d ORCP 32 B(3). Further, predominance asks the questions commonality does not\u2014the centrality of common questions to the resolution of the action and the nature of proof required to litigate common issues: The \u201c\u2018predominance criterion is far more demanding\u2019 than the commonality requirement.\u201d <em>Pearson, </em>358 Or at 109-10 (quoting <em>Amchen Prods., Inc. v. Windsor, </em>521 US 591, 623-24, 117 S Ct 2231, 138 L Ed 2d 689 (1997).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b804-4\">\u201cIn effect, predominance asks: What do the individual class members have in common, what don\u2019t they have in common, and how much will those similarities and dissimilarities matter in litigating the case? In practical terms, the inquiry is designed to determine if proof as to one class member will be proof as to all, or whether dissimilarities among the class members will require individualized inquiries. How the predominance inquiry is answered, then, is a key factor in the trial court\u2019s discretionary assessment of whether a class action will be a fair and efficient means of litigating the case, and thus superior over other available means to resolve the controversy.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b804-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 110-11. \u201cIf the record suggests legitimate and legally material factual differences among the class members that a defendant is entitled to expose through individualized inquiries\u2014what [has been termed] \u2018fatal dissimilarities\u2019 among the class\u2014the predominance inquiry must take those individualized inquiries into account.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 114 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b804-6\">The single predominance factor is reviewed for legal error, <em>Delgado, </em>260 Or App at 489, but superiority, which involves all the factors listed under ORCP 32 B, is reviewed for abuse of discretion, <em>Pearson, </em>358 Or at 106. The trial court \u201chas considerable discretion in weighing all of the factors that apply in a given case and determining if a class action will be superior means of litigating the class claims.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 106-07. Moreover, a \u201ctrial court\u2019s determination that [an] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"783\">*783</page-number>action may proceed as a class action \u2018is largely a decision of judicial administration * * * [and, in] making such decisions the trial court is customarily granted wide latitude.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 107 <em>(quoting Newman v. Tualatin Development Co., Inc., </em>287 Or 47, 51, 597 P2d 800 (1979)). In keeping with the fact that a superiority determination is a matter of judicial administration, attempts to decertify late in the litigation process are disfavored. <em>See Delgado, </em>260 Or App at 489 (the late timing of defendant\u2019s decertification motion supported the trial court\u2019s exercise of discretion when the defendant knew or should have known that it would seek to present witness testimony \u201cin an attempt to call into question whether all workers were subject\u201d to the practice of requiring employees to work off the clock).</p>\n<p id=\"b805-4\">2. <em>The trial court\u2019s certification and denial of the renewed motion for decertification</em></p>\n<p id=\"b805-6\">To begin with, we reject defendant\u2019s challenge to the pretrial certification and the denial of the post-trial motion for decertification. As to the pretrial certification, defendant\u2019s challenge to the class certification on appeal rests on its assertion that <em>trial evidence </em>\u201crevealed an abundance of individualized fact issues and anomalous experiences that overwhelmed any claimed \u2018common\u2019 class issues.\u201d Because its argument on appeal depends on evidence adduced at trial, or its purported lack thereof, the challenge to the court\u2019s certification fails because the trial court could not have erred in certifying the classes before trial based on evidence that was not yet before it.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-7\">We also reject defendant\u2019s challenge to the trial court\u2019s denial of defendant\u2019s second motion to decertify, made in September 2011, well after the February 2010 trial. That challenge relied on what defendant cited as controlling authority, <em>Wal-Mart, </em>in which the United States Supreme Court held that the certification of a class of some 1.5 million female employees lacked proof of commonality that the employer had discriminated against them, as required by FRCP 23(a)(2) (the FRCP equivalent to ORCP 32 A(2)). 564 US at 343. Defendant contends that that decision was decided on grounds that class certification violated the Due <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"784\">*784</page-number>Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution and that, likewise, certification in this case violated its due process rights. The trial court denied the motion on the basis that <em>Wal-Mart </em>is \u201cdistinguishable and otherwise not controlling authority.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b806-4\">We agree. The Court in <em>Wal-Mart </em>did not announce that certification of the class violated federal due process; rather, it concluded that class certification did not satisfy the commonality requirement under FRCP 23(a)(2) because it could not produce a \u201ccommon answer to the crucial question\u201d of why class members were discriminated against. 564 US at 352. Moreover, defendant fails to explain, and we fail to see, how <em>Wal-Mart </em>controls in this case, which resolves state claims and applies state class-certification procedures. Thus, the trial court did not err in denying defendant\u2019s post-trial motion to decertify.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b806-5\">3. <em>The trial court\u2019s denial of defendant\u2019s end-of-trial motion to decertify</em></p>\n<p id=\"b806-7\">Thus, defendant\u2019s challenges to certification of the off-the-clock class and the final-wages class are reduced to its first motion to decertify, which was made on February 2, 2010, the last day of trial testimony, on the grounds that certification did not satisfy the requirement of commonality under ORCP 32 A and superiority under ORCP 32 B. We first reject defendant\u2019s arguments as to the off-the-clock class. Second, we conclude that defendant\u2019s arguments concerning the final-wages class were unpreserved.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"785\">*785</page-number>a. Off-the-clock class</p>\n<p id=\"b807-3\">On appeal, we understand defendant to assert that, because there was some evidence in the record that employees spent time between opening and closing the stores on personal tasks, which, according to defendant was time spent at work for which it had no obligation to pay, and because the time involved in opening and closing the stores varied, those facts were individualized issues that overwhelmed any common issues to the class.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-4\">The commonality question about the off-the-clock class asks if the \u201cclaimed common issues are susceptible to and appropriate for proof of common evidence.\u201d <em>Delgado, </em>260 Or App at 491. Plaintiff sought to prove that defendant had a policy or practice of not paying for time spent between setting the alarm and opening and closing the stores. \u201cProof of an employer custom or practice necessarily requires class-wide common proof.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Moreover, determining whether a class has commonality neither tests \u201chow central the common questions are to the resolution of the action\u201d nor takes \u201cinto account the nature of the proof required to litigate those common issues.\u201d <em>Pearson, </em>358 Or at 109-10. Defendant\u2019s ORCP 32 A(2) challenge seeks to do both, and, accordingly, we reject it.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-5\">Likewise, we are not persuaded by defendant\u2019s predominance argument. As a threshold matter, we note that defendant\u2019s framing of its argument is critically off the mark. That is, defendant contests only whether the class met the predominance inquiry and does not argue that the class fails superiority. As noted, predominance <em>is one of eight factors </em>which the trial court considers to determine whether class-wide litigation is \u201csuperior to other available methods for the fair and efficient adjudication of the controversy,\u201d ORCP 32 B. Although, how \u201cthe predominance inquiry is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"786\">*786</page-number>answered * * * is a key factor in the trial court\u2019s discretionary assessment of whether a class action will be a fair and efficient means of litigating the case, and thus superior over other available means to resolve the controversy,\u201d <em>Pearson, </em>358 Or at 111, ultimately, the relevant question is whether the trial court abused its discretion when it determined superiority of a class action under ORCP 32 B.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-4\">On appeal, defendant insists that decertification rests solely on a legal determination. ORCP 32 B, however, \u201cincludes the predominance of common questions of law and fact as a \u2018pertinent\u2019 matter that the trial court must consider. It does not require predominance as a <em>sine qua non </em>of certification of any class.\u201d <em>Shea v. Chicago Pneumatic Tool Co., </em>164 Or App 198, 207, 990 P2d 912 (1999), <em>rev den, </em>330 Or 252 (2000); <em>see also Pearson, </em>358 Or at 106-07 (\u201cNeither the \u2018predominance\u2019 factor nor any of the other seven, however, is controlling. Rather, the trial court has considerable discretion in weighing all of the factors that apply in a given case and determining if a class action will be a superior means of litigating the class claims.\u201d); <em>Shea, </em>164 Or App at 207 (\u201c[T]he fact that the trial court concluded that common questions of law and fact did not predominate the action as a whole does not mean that, as a matter of law, the trial court cannot certify an issue class.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b808-5\">Here it is not clear that the issue of predominance drove the trial court\u2019s denial of the motion to decertify; the court did not single out that factor in its ruling on the motion, which was made on the last day of trial. <em>Cf. Pearson, </em>358 Or at 109 (\u201cBecause the trial court\u2019s superiority assessment was driven by its predominance conclusion, 358 Or at 106, the question at this juncture is only whether, based on this record, plaintiffs established that common issues predominate over individual ones, contrary to the trial court\u2019s conclusion.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b808-6\">Nevertheless, even if we assume for the sake of argument that a lack of predominance could determine the superiority assessment, we reject defendant\u2019s arguments that it was legal error to conclude that common issues predominate over individual concerns. There are two reasons. Variance in the amount of time spent opening and closing the stores <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"787\">*787</page-number>is not a material fact that requires individual inquiries as to certification. Those differences concern a class member\u2019s entitlement to damages. \u201cA class action is not inappropriate simply because each class member will have to make an individualized showing to recover damages.\u201d <em>See Delgado, </em>260 Or App at 493.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-3\">Second, simply because there was witness testimony of time spent on personal tasks, such as putting on a coat, stowing lunches, or using the bathroom, defendant was not entitled to individualized inquiries to determine what class members were doing with their time during unpaid work periods. Defendant has not provided the legal basis for why a \u201cpersonal task\u201d such as putting away a coat or using the bathroom is time that is not compensable. Under the wage and hour statutes, \u201cwork time\u201d includes \u201cboth time worked and time of authorized attendance.\u201d ORS 653.010(11). \u201cHours worked\u201d means</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b809-4\">\u201call hours for which an employee is employed by and required to give to the employer and includes all time during which an employee is necessarily required to be on the employer\u2019s premises, on duty or at a prescribed work place and all time the employee is suffered or permitted to work. \u2018Hours worked\u2019 includes \u2018work time\u2019 as defined in ORS 653.010(11).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b809-5\">OAR 839-020-0004(19).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Plaintiffs off-the-clock claim is that employees were required to be on defendant\u2019s premises before they were able to clock in and after they clocked out. Defendant fails to develop an argument that, under Oregon\u2019s wage and hour laws, time spent on \u201cpersonal tasks\u201d during the time an employee is required to be on his or her employer\u2019s premises is time that is not compensable. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"788\">*788</page-number>Accordingly, we reject defendant\u2019s contention that whether an employee spent time on personal tasks during the opening and closing of stores is an individualized and material fact that predominates over common issues of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-3\">b. Final-wages class</p>\n<p id=\"b810-4\">As to the final-wages class, defendant\u2019s general argument is that the trial evidence was too varied and insufficiently competent to show that it systematically failed to timely pay final wages as required by ORS 652.140. More narrowly, defendant contends that it was entitled to litigate class members\u2019 claims individually, rather than through class action adjudication, because the claims depended on \u201cproof of when the employee provided notice of intent to quit, and when each final paycheck was provided.\u201d Defendant argues that the defect of the differences is magnified because ORS 652.140 imposes different time periods for which an employer is obligated to pay final wages.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> That is, under subsection 2(a), if an employee gives at least 48 hours\u2019 notice, the employer must pay wages due immediately at the time of quitting and, under subsection (2)(b), if the employee does not give such notice, the employer has five days\u2014excluding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"789\">*789</page-number>weekend days and holidays\u2014to pay final wages. According to defendant, the evidence adduced at trial revealed factual discrepancies among employees regarding when they gave their notice and when they received their paychecks. Moreover, defendant challenges the testimony of the plaintiffs\u2019 expert, Dr. Fountain, who provided calculations of the average number of days that final paychecks were delayed. That testimony, defendant contends, was flawed (its foundation was \u201cinsufficient, unreliable\u201d) because it relied on evidence of the last day an employee worked, not when they were \u201cterminated,\u201d and did not take into account weekend days and holidays. That flaw, contends defendant, deprived it of its fundamental due process rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-4\">In response, plaintiff contends that defendant failed to preserve its appellate arguments. A party who claims an error on appeal must preserve the error in the trial court before we will consider it. ORAP 5.45(1); <em>see Delgado, </em>260 Or App at 487-88 (\u201cThe preservation rule allows the opposing party an opportunity to respond and the trial court an opportunity to understand the position and avoid or correct the error.\u201d (Citing <em>Quick Collect, Inc. v. Higgins, </em>258 Or App 234, 239, 308 P3d 1089 (2013).)).</p>\n<p id=\"b811-5\">To the extent that defendant makes a due process argument regarding the final-wages claim and Fountain\u2019s testimony, we reject it because that argument was not made until its renewed motion for decertification, and as we noted above, defendant\u2019s reliance on <em>Wal-Mart </em>is misplaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-6\">To the extent that defendant makes an argument that individual concerns vastly outweigh common issues because the obligations under ORS 652.140 depend on when an employee has provided notice of intent to quit, that argument is not preserved. The argument made below to which defendant points\u2014the final-wage claim is \u201cabsolutely dependent upon the date that <em>*** </em>an employer knows that the employee is quitting\u201d\u2014was made in support of a separately argued oral motion to dismiss, not to decertify. There, defendant argued that plaintiffs final-wages claim failed as a matter of law but did not explain to the court how the case authority it cited, <em>Wilson v. Smurfit Newsprint Corp., </em>197 Or App 648, 107 P3d 61 (2005), meant that individual issues <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"790\">*790</page-number>predominated over facts common to the final-wages class.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In its written motion to decertify, defendant asserted that \u201cthe evidence in this case is that final wages are paid on time unless store managers are unaware that the employee has quit.\u201d Not only does that argument attacking the sufficiency of the evidence fail to address the questions of commonality or predominance,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> it fails to preserve defendant\u2019s argument on appeal that the class should be decertified because a willful violation of ORS 652.140 depends on proof of when an employee provided notice of intent to quit. Neither argument made below preserves defendant\u2019s argument on appeal because the arguments did not provide \u201cthe opposing party an opportunity to respond and the trial court an opportunity to understand the position and avoid or correct the error.\u201d <em>Delgado, </em>260 Or App at 488. Thus, defendant\u2019s argument about class certification of the final-wages claim was not preserved for our review.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-4\">B. <em>Willfulness</em></p>\n<p id=\"b812-5\">In its third and fourth assignments of error, defendant argues that the trial court erred in awarding civil penalties without a jury finding that defendant willfully <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"791\">*791</page-number>failed to pay unpaid wages. That is, for the off-the-clock claims, the two categories of penalties challenged by defendant are (1) those for unpaid regular wages upon termination under ORS 652.150 (described by the parties as Type 3 penalties) and (2) those for unpaid overtime under ORS 653.055 (described by the parties as Type 2 penalties).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> As we explain further below, ORS 652.150 provides that penalty wages are imposed if an employer \u201cwillfully fails to pay any wages or compensation of any employee whose employment ceases, as provided in ORS 652.140 and 652.145[.]\u201d At the same time, ORS 653.055(1) provides that if an employer fails to pay overtime, it is liable for \u201ccivil penalties provided in ORS 652.150.\u201d According to defendant, to impose penalties, those provisions required the jury to find that defendant\u2019s failure to pay wages for plaintiffs off-the-clock claims was willful.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-4\">In response, plaintiff argues (1) that defendant failed to preserve its claim of error because it failed to take exception to the jury instructions, ORCP 59 H,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and (2) defendant waived its claim of error because it failed to demand that the special verdict form include the question <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"792\">*792</page-number>of willfulness, ORCP 61 B.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Additionally, plaintiff reprises the contention he made below that a finding of willfulness was not required for the Type 3 penalties. For the following reasons, we disagree with plaintiffs arguments based on ORCP 59 H and ORCP 61 B, and we agree with defendant on the merits of its assignments of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-4\">1. <em>ORCP 59 H and 61 B</em></p>\n<p id=\"b814-5\">Before trial, defendant submitted a proposed jury instruction that, to \u201crecover a penalty wage, the plaintiff must prove the defendant\u2019s failure to pay wages was willful\u201d and a special verdict form, asking the jury to find whether defendant\u2019s practice of withholding pay for plaintiffs off-the-clock claims was willful. Near the end of trial, on January 28, 2010, the trial court discussed the issue of willfulness with the parties in the following colloquy:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b814-6\">\u201c [PLAINTIFF]: The only place that willfulness, under the Oregon statute applies, is in the circumstances of unpaid wages at time of termination.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b814-7\">\u201cTHE COURT: So [plaintiff] want[s] to limit the instruction on willfulness to that final wages on termination?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b814-8\">\u201c[PLAINTIFF]: That\u2019s correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b814-9\">\u201cTHE COURT: [Defendant], are you in agreement, that that is where willfulness applies?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b814-10\">\u201c [DEFENDANT]: Absolutely not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b814-11\">\u201cTHE COURT: You believe it\u2019s on every one of the penalties is-\u2014willfulness is required?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b814-12\">\u201c[DEFENDANT]: Right. Because this is what ORS 653.055 states: \u2018Any employer who pays an employee less than the wage to which the employee is entitled, is liable for the full amount of wages, less any amount actually paid <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"793\">*793</page-number>to the employee by the employer, and for civil penalties provided under ORS 652.150.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b815-3\">\u201cSo it doesn\u2019t just say, and civil penalties. It says, civil penalties under 652.150. And when you go to 652.150, \u2018Except as provided in 2 and 3 of this section, if an employer willfully fails to pay wages,\u2019 so the element of willfulness is included in every penalty.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b815-4\">Plaintiff countered that, because ORS 652.150 refers to ORS 652.140, which requires an employer to timely pay final wages, willfulness applied as a condition of imposing penalties for violations of ORS 652.140 but not overtime violations of ORS 653.055. The court responded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b815-5\">\u201c[W]hat [plaintiff] just said has been my understanding for about 25 or 30 years of Oregon law. So I am going to look at these statutes again.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b815-6\">\u201cBut, [defendant], unless I change my mind on what they mean, and I have thought one thing for many many years, unless I change my mind, I am not going to agree with you. But it does\u2014except on 653.055, that\u2019s the\u2014well, final wages on termination, both sides agree, need to have willfulness.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b815-7\">The trial court did not change its mind. Before the court instructed the jury, on February 2, it discussed the instructions it would give to the jury so as to allow the parties to take exceptions. Although, during the course of that colloquy, defendant referred to a proposed instruction that required the jury to find willfulness, it did so as an exception to plaintiffs\u2019 proposed jury instruction titled \u201cFinal Wages and Willfulness,\u201d which concerned the burden of an employer to timely deliver an employee\u2019s final wages when the employment relationship ends, <em>i.e., </em>the final-wages claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-8\">At the end of the day\u2014after 5:00 p.m.\u2014the trial court, stating that it had made its rulings on the instructions, turned to the proposed special verdict forms. The court noted that it had made various rulings that were in accord with the special verdict forms proposed by plaintiff and, commenting that defendant had submitted something else entirely and had objected to the special verdict form that was in front of it, asked defendant if it had any other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"794\">*794</page-number>specific objections for purposes of \u201cfine tuning.\u201d The defendant pointed out some issues it still had with the verdict form and then, after the court reminded defendant that it was after 5:00 p.m., objected \u201cto every single question\u201d in the special verdict form.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-4\">The next day, after the trial court instructed the jury, the court asked the parties if they desired to take any exceptions to the given instructions. Defendant\u2019s counsel replied, \u201c[T]he record is clear about the exceptions that I made yesterday. I have nothing to add to the record that was established yesterday.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b816-5\">As to whether defendant properly took exception, plaintiff correctly points out that, as to whether willfulness was a required element to impose civil penalties for the off-the-clock claims, defendant failed to take a particular exception during the court\u2019s colloquy with the parties before and after the instructions were given to the jury. That failure, however, does not defeat defendant\u2019s claim of error on appeal as a matter of preservation. That is because the Supreme Court has held \u201cthat preservation for claims of instructional error is tested by preservation principles generally, rather than by the requirements of ORCP 59 H.\u201d <em>Dosanjh v. Namaste Indian Restaurant, LLC, </em>272 Or App 87, 90, 353 P3d 1243 (2015) (citing <em>State v. Vanornum, </em>354 Or 614, 629, 317 P3d 889 (2013)); <em>State v. Carlon, </em>265 Or App 390, 393-94, 335 P3d 343 (2014) (quoting <em>Vanornum, </em>354 Or at 631 (ORCP 59 H does not \u201cset the standard by which the appellate courts will determine if a claim of instructional error is preserved. Instead, preservation must be determined by this court\u2019s preservation jurisprudence.\u201d)). \u201cThose [preservation principles] ensure that trial courts have an opportunity to understand and correct their own possible errors and that the parties are not \u2018taken by surprise, misled, or denied opportunities to meet an argument.\u2019\u201d <em>Vanornum, </em>354 Or at 632 (quoting <em>State v. Walker, </em>350 Or 540, 548, 258 P3d 1228 (2011)).</p>\n<p id=\"b816-6\">Under that rubric, we conclude that defendant preserved its willfulness argument for appeal. It is patent that the trial court and plaintiff were apprised of defendant\u2019s position on the penalty statutes and, in particular, that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"795\">*795</page-number>instructions must include a willfulness finding for the off-the-clock claims. Defendant\u2019s argument that willfulness was required for the off-the-clock claims was sufficient to preserve it.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-4\">Likewise, we conclude that defendant did not waive its right to have the jury make a finding of willfulness under ORCP 61 B. ORCP 61 B provides, in relevant part, that when the court provides a special verdict form to the jury so that the jury can make special findings of fact, if \u201cthe court omits any issue of fact raised by the pleadings or by the evidence, each party waives the right to a trial by jury of the issue so omitted unless before the jury retires such party demands its submission to the jury.\u201d Plaintiff argues that, because defendant\u2019s general objections to the special verdict forms did not expressly reference its previous contentions that the jury was required to decide willfulness, it waived that argument under ORCP 61 B for the same we reason we concluded that the defendant in <em>Taylor v. Ramsay-Gerding Construction Co., </em>235 Or App 524, 234 P3d 129 (2010), waived its right to assert that a factual matter be submitted to the jury.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> We disagree with plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-5\">In <em>Taylor, </em>during the jury trial, the parties actively litigated whether the jury should decide whether the plaintiffs complaint had been timely filed. 235 Or App at 530. The trial court ruled before the jury deliberated that the effect of its previous rulings was that the limitations issue had been decided as a matter of law in the defendant\u2019s favor. <em>Id. </em>at 530-31. When that ruling was made, the plaintiff did not object to the trial court\u2019s explanation of the effect of its previous ruling. <em>Id. </em>at 531. We concluded that, under ORCP 61 B, the \u201cdefendant was required to voice an objection to the court\u2019s decision to remove that issue from the jury in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"796\">*796</page-number>order to avoid waiving the right to a jury trial of that issue.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In this case, however, unlike in <em>Taylor, </em>defendant did object to the court\u2019s decision that the issue of willfulness was not required; defendant did contend that willfulness should be considered by the jury; and defendant had previously provided the court with a proposed special verdict form that matched its objection. Also, the court indicated that it was aware of what defendant had proposed and, indicating that time was short, limited defendant\u2019s objections to \u201cfine tun[ing]\u201d the proposed special verdict forms, which suggests that it would have been pointless for defendant to assert at that time that the special verdict form should include a finding of willfulness. Accordingly, we disagree with plaintiff that, at the point the court entertained objections to the special verdict form, defendant was required to explicitly reprise its contention that a willfulness finding be required so as to not waive the issue under ORCP 61 B.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-4\">2. <em>Type 3 penalties</em></p>\n<p id=\"b818-5\">Beginning with defendant\u2019s third assignment of error, we turn to the merits of defendant\u2019s contention that two categories of penalties required the jury to have made a finding of willfulness. In that assignment, defendant contends that, under ORS 652.150, the trial court erred in failing to submit to the jury the factual issue whether defendant willfully failed to pay regular wages earned for opening, closing, and travel time upon termination of employment (as noted, referred to by the parties as a Type 3 penalty). In relevant part, ORS 652.150(1) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b818-6\">\u201cExcept as provided in subsections (2) and (3) of this section,[<footnotemark>14</footnotemark>] if an employer <em>willfully </em>fails to pay any wages or compensation of any employee whose employment ceases, as provided in ORS 652.140 and 652.145, then, as a penalty for the nonpayment, the wages or compensation of the employee shall continue from the date thereof at the same hourly rate for eight hours per day until paid or until action therefor is commenced. However:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b818-7\">\u201c(a) In no case shall the penalty wages or compensation continue for more than 30 days from the due date * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A9U\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"797\">*797</page-number>(Emphasis added.) On appeal, defendant reprises its assertion that, under Oregon case law, a finding of willfulness is required to assess penalties under ORS 652.150; defendant insists that the imposition of penalties is not a matter of strict liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-4\">We agree that ORS 652.150 is not a strict liability statute: Oregon case law is clear that the assessment of penalties for unpaid wages upon termination of employment under ORS 652.150 requires willfulness. \u201cORS 652.150 entitles an employee to penalty wages if (1) his or her employment is terminated and the employer (2) <em>willfully fails to pay, </em>(3) within one business day, (4) wages that are (5) earned and unpaid at the time of the termination.\u201d <em>Wilson, </em>197 Or App at 659 (emphasis added); <em>see also State ex rel Nilsen v. Cushing, </em>253 Or 262, 265, 453 P2d 945 (1969) (penalties assessed under ORS 652.150 in \u201ccases of willful nonpayment of wages\u201d); <em>Nordling </em>v. <em>Johnston, </em>205 Or 315, 327, 283 P2d 994 (1955) (under ORS 652.150, \u201cthe additional liability is only for a wilful wrong\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b819-5\">Plaintiff does not contend that willfulness is not required under ORS 652.150. Rather, plaintiff argues that, once the jury determined that defendant violated the wage statutes, defendant\u2019s failure to pay wages was implicitly or necessarily willful because \u201cat no time between the February 2010 jury verdict and the April 2010 bench trial on civil penalties did defendant pay the jury-awarded wages.\u201d That is, once the jury made its findings, defendant\u2019s failure at that point to pay the unpaid wages automatically became willful.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-6\">Plaintiff relies on our decision in <em>Wilson, </em>197 Or App 648, but that decision is inapposite. It does not stand for the proposition that a jury finding that terminated employees are owed damages for unpaid wages renders an employer\u2019s subsequent nonpayment of those wages \u201cwillful\u201d for the purpose of imposing penalties under ORS 652.150. In <em>Wilson, </em>the employer\u2019s obligation to pay severance pay was governed by a collective bargaining agreement (CBA), and we held that, when an arbitrator construed the CBA as obligating employer to pay severance, the \u201cdefendant\u2019s level of awareness reasonably should have changed.\u201d 197 Or App at 666. Here, there was no contractual provision that governed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"798\">*798</page-number>defendant\u2019s obligation to pay unpaid wages upon termination as to the off-the-clock claims, and any reasonable awareness of its obligation to do so coincided with the relevant time period for which it was obligated to pay unpaid wages.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-4\">3. <em>Type 2 penalties</em></p>\n<p id=\"b820-5\">Defendant also contends that the imposition of penalties under ORS 653.055(1)\u2014for unpaid overtime wages, a violation of ORS 653.261 (Type 2 penalties)\u2014requires a finding of willfulness. That is, defendant argues that, because ORS 653.055(1) incorporates by reference ORS 652.150, which is not a strict liability statute, it was error for the trial court to award penalties under ORS 653.055(1) without requiring a willfulness finding. In other words, because ORS 653.055 expressly incorporates ORS 652.150, ORS 653.055 incorporates the willfulness requirement of ORS 652.150. Plaintiff counters that the reference to ORS 652.150 is \u201cmerely for the purpose of calculating the penalty owed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b820-6\">Our task is to construe ORS 653.055(1) and ORS 652.150 to determine if the legislature intended a willfulness finding for imposing penalties for unpaid overtime wages. In doing so, we construe those statutes to discern the legislature\u2019s intent in enacting them and to give effect to that intent. <em>State v. Gaines, </em>346 Or 160, 171-72, 206 P3d 1042 (2009). Our methodology in discerning the legislature\u2019s intent takes into account the text of the statute, the context of the statute, including the case law that construes it, the legislative history of the statute and, if necessary, any pertinent maxims of statutory construction. <em>Id. </em>Also, the legislature has instructed that our task is to \u201csimply to ascertain and declare what is, in terms of substance, contained therein, not to insert what has been omitted, or to omit what has been inserted.\u201d ORS 174.010.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-7\">As to the violation, ORS 653.055(1) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b820-8\">\u201cAny employer who pays an employee less than the wages to which the employee is entitled under ORS 653.010 to 653.261 is liable to the employee affected:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b820-9\">\u201c(a) For the full amount of the wages, less any amount actually paid to the employee by the employer; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b821-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"799\">*799</page-number>\u201c(b) For civil penalties <em>provided in ORS 652.150.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b821-4\">(Emphasis added.) As quoted before, the pertinent text of ORS 652.150(1) provides that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b821-5\">\u201cif an employer <em>willfully </em>fails to pay any wages or compensation of any employee whose employment ceases, as provided in ORS 652.140 and 652.145, then, as a penalty for the nonpayment, the wages or compensation of the employee shall continue from the date thereof at the same hourly rate for eight hours per day until paid or until action therefor is commenced.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b821-6\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b821-7\">We understand the fundamental disagreement of the parties\u2019 interpretation of the statutes to be a dispute about how much of the text of ORS 652.150 is and is not operative when referenced by ORS 653.055(1). Plaintiffs argument\u2019s presupposes that, because ORS 652.150 is only for the purpose of that provision\u2019s calculation of damages, the portion of the statute\u2019s text that does not concern such calculation does not have any effect.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> In other words, plaintiffs construction of the statute would have ORS 652.150 begin at \u201cas a penalty for the nonpayment, the wages or compensation of the employee shall continue from the date thereof ***.\u201d In plaintiffs view, because ORS 653.055(1) imposes penalties for the failure to pay overtime when due regardless of whether an employee\u2019s employment has ceased, when penalties are imposed under ORS 653.055(1), the entire clause\u2014\u201cif an employer willfully fails to pay any wages or compensation of any employee whose employment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"800\">*800</page-number>ceases\u201d\u2014is no longer pertinent. Defendant\u2019s argument, on the other hand, posits that only the phrase \u201cwhose employment ceases, as provided in ORS 652.140 and 652.145\u201d is not given effect, leaving \u201cif an employer willfully fails to pay any wages or compensation of any employee\u201d and \u201cthen, as a penalty for the nonpayment, the wages or compensation of the employee shall continue from the date thereof * * * \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b822-4\">To put it mildly, the reference in ORS 653.055 to ORS 652.150 (which in turn is meant to apply to ORS 652.140) is an example of awkward drafting. Although there is, perhaps, some logic to eliminating the entire clause preceding the reference to ORS 652.140 and ORS 652.145 (\u00bf.e., \u201cwillfully fails to pay\u201d) if part of that clause (\u201cwhose employment ceases\u201d) is not applicable, plaintiff has not put forth a principle of statutory construction for why that must be so. On the other hand, defendant\u2019s construction of ORS 652.150\u2014in which \u201cwillfully fails to pay any wages or compensation of any employee\u201d remains operative when referenced by ORS 653.055(1)\u2014gives effect to more of the statute than plaintiffs construction. Defendant\u2019s interpretation would be consistent with our \u201cobligat [ion] to take a statute as we find it and give effect to all of it, if possible.\u201d <em>Wyers v. American Medical Response Northwest, Inc., </em>360 Or 211, 221, 377 P3d 570 (2016); <em>see also Murphy v. Nilsen, </em>19 Or App 292, 298, 527 P2d 736 (1974) (citing ORS 174.010 and quoting <em>Blyth &amp; Co., Inc. v. City of Portland, </em>204 Or 153, 159, 282 P2d 363 (1955) (\u201cCourts do not cast aside language of a law as meaningless if it is reasonably possible to give it effect. *** Courts must so construe a statute as to give effect to every section, clause, phrase or word of the legislative act.\u201d) (Brackets and internal quotation marks omitted.)).</p>\n<p id=\"b822-5\">Defendant\u2019s approach is consistent with the statutory mandate, ORS 174.010, that particulars of statutes must be adopted so as to not \u201cinsert what has been omitted, or to omit what has been inserted.\u201d Plaintiffs construction of ORS 652.150 and ORS 653.055 does both. That is, plaintiff argues that the real meaning of the reference to ORS 652.150 is for the purpose of penalty calculation only. In enacting ORS 653.055, the legislature had the opportunity to write subsection (b) in the manner asserted by plaintiff, which would substitute \u201cas calculated\u201d for \u201cprovided,\u201d <em>i.e., </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"801\">*801</page-number>\u201cFor civil penalties <em>as calculated </em>in ORS 652.150.\u201d Instead, ORS 653.055(1) makes an employer liable for \u201ccivil penalties provided in ORS 652.150.\u201d Using the term \u201cprovided\u201d rather than \u201cas calculated\u201d suggests a broader reading of ORS 652.150 to include the <em>provisions </em>of ORS 652.150, namely, its requirement of a willful failure to pay wages owed. <em>See State v. Cloutier, </em>351 Or 68, 98, 261 P3d 1234 (2011) (noting \u201cthe interpretive principle that, if possible, we give a statute with multiple parts a construction that \u2018will give effect to all\u2019 of those parts\u201d (quoting ORS 174.010)).</p>\n<p id=\"b823-3\">Indeed, ORS 653.055, and its reference to ORS 652.150, was adopted in 1967, several years after the Supreme Court had stated that ORS 652.150 was not a strict liability statute. <em>State ex rel Nilsen v. Cushing, </em>233 Or 103, 108, 377 P2d 331 (1962). \u201cContext includes the preexisting common law and the statutory framework within which the law was enacted.\u201d <em>Ram Technical Services, Inc. v. Koresko, </em>346 Or 215, 232, 208 P3d 950 (2009) (internal quotation marks omitted). The adoption of ORS 653.055 may be fairly understood to have been done with an understanding of what ORS 652.150 had been construed to mean.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-4\">Plaintiff asserts that defendant is attempting to insert willfulness into ORS 653.055(1) and that, if such was the legislature\u2019s intent, it \u201ccould have easily inserted \u2018willfully\u2019 [into ORS 653.055(1)] if it had desired, since that word is specifically used in ORS 652.150, which is older.\u201d The strength of the argument, however, disappears with a question: Why bother adding a willfulness element in ORS 653.055(1), creating redundancy, when there is already a willfulness element in ORS 652.150? Indeed, knowing that ORS 652.150 was not a strict liability statute, if the legislature had intended to limit the reference to ORS 652.150 for the purpose of only calculating damages, and, if the legislature had intended that penalties awarded under ORS 653.055(1) were a matter of strict liability, then the legislature could have drafted ORS 653.055(1) and its reference to ORS 652.150 in such a manner that would make it clear that that was the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-5\">Although the legislative history is scant, what little there is indicates that the legislature, in enacting ORS <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"802\">*802</page-number>653.055, intended to provide for civil penalties for employment condition violations under ORS 653.010 to 653.261 when an employer\u2019s violation of those provisions was willful. Belton Hamilton, a representative of the Bureau of Labor, testified before the House Committee on Labor and Management. As reflected in the minutes, Hamilton testified that the amendment to the bill that provided for civil penalties was \u201cfor any employer who willfully pays less than the minimum wage. The employee is paid a penalty for any time he has to wait for his pay.\u201d Minutes, House Committee on Labor and Management, HB 1340, Mar 10, 1967, 2. Similarly, George Brown, a representative of the Oregon AFL-CIO, explained that the penalty provision was for the event \u201cif anyone attempts to evade the payment of wages [,] the wages can continue up to 30 days and the employer is still liable for them.\u201d Minutes, Senate Committee on Labor and Industries, HB 1340, Apr 26, 1967, 4. Together, those statements indicate that the labor-interest representatives advocating for the penalty provision understood and communicated to the legislative committees that the penalty provision was not to be imposed as a matter of strict liability, but required willful failure to pay wages by an employer.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b824-4\">Finally, giving effect to the word \u201cwillfully\u201d in the statute helps to resolve concerns that the imposition of penalties is unconstitutional. The Supreme Court has noted, in an opinion that answered a challenge to the constitutionality of ORS 652.150 on grounds that it is vague, arbitrary, and discriminatory, that \u201cORS 652.150 operates only where the employer has \u2018willfully\u2019 failed to meet the obligations outlined in ORS 652.140\u201d and that its \u201cpurpose is to protect employees from unscrupulous or careless employers who fail to compensate their employees although they are fully aware of their obligation to do so.\u201d <em>Nilsen, </em>233 Or at 108. The court also addressed federal due process concerns that the penalty\u2019s application \u201cresults in an arbitrary and unreasonable confiscation of property\u201d by remarking that that proposition <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"803\">*803</page-number>assumes, erroneously, that the penalized employer \u201cis ignorant of the fact that the employer is indebted to his former employee.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 109.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-4\">Likewise, construing ORS 653.055(1) and its reference to ORS 652.150 so as to include \u201cwillfulness\u201d avoids the danger of constitutional concerns. \u201cIt is axiomatic that we should construe and interpret statutes \u2018in such a manner as to avoid any serious constitutional problems.\u2019\u201d <em>Bernstein Bros. v. Dept. of Rev., </em>294 Or 614, 621, 661 P2d 537 (1983) (quoting <em>Easton v. Hurita, </em>290 Or 689, 694, 625 P2d 1290 (1981)). \u201cIndeed, \u2018[w]hen confronted with competing, reasonable constructions of a statute, and there is even a tenable argument that one of them would render the statute unconstitutional, we generally favor the other construction.\u2019\u201d <em>State v. Alvarado, </em>257 Or App 612, 621, 307 P3d 540 (2013) (quoting <em>Pete's Mountain Homeowners v. Ore. Water Resources, </em>236 Or App 507, 522, 238 P3d 395 (2010)).</p>\n<p id=\"b825-5\">In sum, we conclude that the reference to ORS 652.150 in ORS 653.055(1) includes the need to establish that an employer\u2019s failure to pay wages is willful in order to impose civil penalties. The trial court erred by not allowing the jury to make that determination for both Type 2 and 3 penalties for the off-the-clock claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-6\">C. <em>ORCP 32 N: Tolling of Penalties</em></p>\n<p id=\"b825-7\">The trial court determined that the 2005 filing of the <em>Joarnt </em>action against defendant tolled, under ORCP 32 N, the statute of limitations for certain of the class members\u2019 claims, eventually resulting in the award of $862,894 in additional civil penalties. In part, ORCP 32 N provides that the \u201cstatute of limitations is tolled for all class members upon the commencement of an action asserting a class action.\u201d In its second assignment of error, defendant raises several arguments challenging that determination, namely, that the tolling was an adjudication of the <em>Joarnt </em>action and that the trial court lacked authority to do so, that the tolling was not allowed under ORCP 32 C and ORCP 32 N, and that defendant was deprived of a jury trial on those claims. In its eighth and ninth assignments of error, defendant challenges the trial court\u2019s denial\u2014on procedural grounds\u2014of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"804\">*804</page-number>a prejudgment \u201cMotion to Reduce Penalties\u201d and an ORCP 64 motion for a new trial as well as a post-judgment ORCP 64 motion and a motion for judgment notwithstanding in the verdict. In those motions, defendant challenged the imposition of the penalties primarily on the ground that the amount of the penalties compared to the amount of actual damages violated federal due process under <em>Gore, </em>517 US 559. Defendant also raised a challenge to the additional <em>Joarnt </em>penalties in the prejudgment motion and the post-judgment ORCP 64 motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-3\">Our conclusion that the trial court erred in imposing penalties for the off-the-clock claims without finding that defendant willfully failed to pay the unpaid wages obviates the need to address defendant\u2019s arguments concerning the additional penalties as to those particular claims. What remains, however, is defendant\u2019s challenge to the tolled penalties as to the final-wages claim. For the reasons we discuss below, we decline to review defendant\u2019s second assignment of error because its failure to comply with ORAP 5.45 hinders our review of the assignment. Moreover, we conclude that the trial court did not err in denying defendant\u2019s pre- and post-judgment motions on procedural grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-4\">As to defendant\u2019s second assignment of error, under its preservation of error subheading, defendant states that the issue was \u201cheavily litigated\u201d and that there \u201cwas extensive briefing, in which [defendant] raised objections. (OJIN 500, 529, 531, 576, 592, 606, 607, 634 636).\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Additionally, defendant points to nine different findings, conclusion of law, or orders that implicated the tolled penalties in its excerpt of record. Defendant posits that that description of its preservation history satisfied what is required under ORAP 5.45(4)(a), which provides, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b826-5\">\u201cEach assignment of error shall demonstrate that the question or issue presented by the assignment of error timely and properly was raised and preserved in the lower court. Under the subheading \u2018Preservation of Error\u2019:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b827-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"805\">*805</page-number>\u201c(i) Each assignment of error, as appropriate, must specify the stage in the proceedings when the question or issue presented by the assignment of error was raised in the lower court, the method or manner of raising it, and the way in which it was resolved or passed on by the lower court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b827-4\">\u201c(ii) Each assignment of error must set out pertinent quotations of the record where the question or issue was raised and the challenged ruling was made, together with reference to the pages of the transcript or other parts of the record quoted or to the excerpt of record if the material quoted is set out in the excerpt of record. When the parts of the record relied on under this clause are lengthy, they shall be included in the excerpt of record instead of the body of the brief.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b827-5\">We disagree that defendant complied with ORAP 5.45(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b827-6\">\u201cCompliance with ORAP 5.45 is not a matter of mere form; it is crucial to our ability to review trial court rulings for error and to determine whether the appellant\u2019s claims of error were preserved below.\u201d <em>Village at North Pointe Condo. Assn. v. Bloedel Constr., </em>278 Or App 354, 359, 374 P3d 978, <em>adh\u2019d to as modified on recons, </em>281 Or App 322, 383 P3d 409 (2016); <em>see </em>ORAP 5.45(4)(c) (\u201cThe court may decline to consider any assignment of error that requires the court to search the record to find the error or to determine if the error properly was raised and preserved.\u201d). Moreover, we have no obligation \u201cto take it upon ourselves to review the record to find that matters assigned as error are preserved and may instead decline consideration of those assignments.\u201d <em>Holbrook v. Precision Helicopters, Inc., </em>162 Or App 538, 544, 986 P2d 646, <em>rev den, </em>329 Or 527 (1999); <em>see also Strawn v. Farmers Ins. Co., </em>228 Or App 454, 475, 209 P3d 357 (2009), <em>aff\u2019d in part and rev\u2019d in part on other grounds, </em>350 Or 336, 258 P3d 1199, <em>adh\u2019d to on recons, </em>350 Or 521, 256 P3d 100 (2011), <em>cert </em>den, _ US _, 132 S Ct 1142 (2012) (declining to reach claims of error because the noncompliance with ORAP 5.45 rendered the court unable to determine what rulings were being challenged and whether the bases for the challenges were preserved below).</p>\n<p id=\"b827-8\">To be sure, the rule allows a party to set out \u201cpertinent quotations of the record\u201d in the excerpt of record, but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"806\">*806</page-number>that allowance is not so lenient as to permit a party to refer to multiple \u201cOJIN\u201d reference numbers,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> especially without any signposts directing us to where in the record we can view the arguments raised by a party on appeal. A reference to an OJIN number is not a reference to a briefs excerpt of record and does not satisfy the requirement that, under ORAP 5.45(4)(a)(ii), <em>pertinent quotations </em>of the record be included in the assignment\u2019s preservation section or in the excerpt of record. Moreover, even if it did, the bare OJIN number references fail to satisfy the requirement that a party point us more specifically to where in a document or transcript we can find the preserved argument. ORAP 5.45(4)(a)(ii) (an assignment of error must also provide \u201creference to the pages of the transcript or other parts of the record quoted or to the excerpt of record if the material quoted is set out in the excerpt of record\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b828-4\">Further, the problem of defendant\u2019s nonspecificity is compounded because defendant\u2019s second assignment of error raises multiple arguments and grounds asserting trial court error, which would require us to sift through defendant\u2019s nine document references to discover the manner in which it preserved each argument. We have no obligation to do so. ORAP 5.45(c). Because defendant\u2019s failure to show us where and how it preserved the arguments it advances on appeal hinders our ability to properly consider the trial court\u2019s ruling, we decline to review the merits of defendant\u2019s arguments raised in its second assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-5\">We next address defendant\u2019s eighth and ninth assignments of error, which challenge the trial court\u2019s denial\u2014on procedural grounds\u2014of motions made before and after the general judgment was entered. Those motions challenged the award of statutory penalties, which defendant challenges on substantive grounds in other assignments of error. As noted, defendant\u2019s motions mainly contended that the penalties compared to the amount of actual damages violated federal due process under <em>Gore, </em>but defendant also raised a challenge to the additional <em>Joarnt </em>penalties in the prejudgment motion and the post-judgment ORCP 64 motion for a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"807\">*807</page-number>new trial. Although our reversal of the penalties imposed on the off-the-clock claims obviates much of what defendant challenged in those motions, we address its challenge to the denial of pre- and post-judgment motions to the extent they challenged the <em>Joarnt </em>penalties as to the final-wages claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-4\">We begin with the court\u2019s denial of defendant\u2019s prejudgment \u201cMotion to Reduce Penalties to Legal Limits; Alternative Motion For New Trial (ORCP 64).\u201d At the hearing on the motions, the trial court construed defendant\u2019s motions as one motion and denied it on procedural grounds. The court ruled that it found unavailing defendant\u2019s contention that the federal due process framework under <em>Gore, </em>which involved punitive damages, applied to statutory penalties. Among other reasons, the court determined that, by way of ORCP 64 C, to the extent that defendant sought relief under ORCP 64 B(5), defendant had failed to move for dismissal under ORCP 54 B(2) after the bench trial; and that, to the extent that defendant sought relief under ORCP 64 B(6), defendant had not set out the relevant matters to which it had properly objected or taken exception.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b829-5\">Defendant asserts that the trial court erred in deciding its ORCP 64 motion because the alternative motion was to be considered only if the trial court were to grant its motion to reduce penalties to legal limits. That argument made on appeal, however, is more elaborate than the one offered in its motions below. It was presented below in the \u201calternative and in the event that it is a procedurally appropriate disposition.\u201d We take note of two things: first, defendant concedes that the circumstances of its \u201cMotion to Reduce Penalties,\u201d challenging the award of civil penalties determined by a bench trial on grounds normally applied to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"808\">*808</page-number>jury-determined punitive damages, lacked \u201cprocedural precedent,\u201d and, second, defendant in its subsequent ORCP 64 motion for a new trial, again raised a challenge to the tolled penalties. <em>Cf. Wilmoth v. Ann Sacks Tile and Stone, Inc., </em>224 Or App 315, 330, 197 P3d 567 (2008) (\u201cA motion for a judgment notwithstanding the verdict is not the appropriate procedure to challenge a claim tried to the court. However, when a motion is so labeled but asks the court to set aside its own judgment and reach different factual findings and conclusions of law, that motion functions as one for a new trial.\u201d). In that light, we conclude that, at least with respect to defendant\u2019s challenge to the tolled penalties, the trial court did not err in viewing defendant\u2019s motions as a motion for a new trial and then denying the ORCP 64 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-3\">The trial court did not err due to another procedural problem. It is a problem that the trial court identified and that is compounded here. A motion brought under ORCP 64 B(5)\u2014that the evidence is insufficient \u201cto justify the verdict or other decision, or that is against the law\u201d\u2014 requires a prior motion for a directed verdict, or, in the case of a bench trial, requires a party to have moved to dismiss under ORCP 54 B(2).<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> <em>See Arena v. Gringich, </em>305 Or 1, 8 n 1, 748 P2d 547 (1988) (even though ORCP 64 B(5) does not expressly require a prior objection, \u201ca motion for directed verdict has long been a prerequisite for an appeal assigning lack of evidence, with or without a [subsequent] motion for a new trial\u201d); <em>Riverside Homes, Inc. v. Murray, </em>230 Or App 292, 298 n 3, 214 P3d 835 (2009) (a directed motion verdict is equivalent to a motion for involuntary dismissal under ORCP 54 B(2) when issue is tried to the court). Defendant failed to file or otherwise make an ORCP 54 B(2) motion.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b830-4\">Similarly, defendant did not comply with the requirements of ORCP 64 B(6), which requires that, to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"809\">*809</page-number>assert that a legal error occurred at trial, a party seeking the relief of a new trial, must have objected to or taken exception to the alleged legal error. In its memorandum supporting its motion, defendant merely incorporated by reference defendant\u2019s writ of mandamus to the Supreme Court, in which it had challenged the tolled penalties and which was denied by the court. That reference was inadequate to show a prior objection. Consequently, the trial court did not err in concluding that defendant failed to properly object or take exception to the tolling of the penalties.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-4\">As to defendant\u2019s subsequent, post-judgment ORCP 64 motion for a new trial, defendant again asserted that it was entitled to a new trial on the tolled penalties. The trial court found that defendant had \u201cwaived\u201d its right to file a second ORCP 64 motion that raised \u201cthe same or additional issues and request [ed] the same or additional relief,\u201d and denied the second motion on the same grounds as it did the first motion. The trial court\u2019s conclusion that defendant had waived its right to move a second time for a new trial was effectively the trial court characterizing the second motion as a motion for reconsideration. A trial court has broad discretion in determining whether to reconsider its earlier rulings, <em>State v. Guzek, </em>358 Or 251, 268, 363 P3d 480 (2015) (so stating), and here, we conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying defendant\u2019s second motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-5\">D. <em>Attorney Fees</em></p>\n<p id=\"b831-6\">In its seventh assignment of error, defendant challenges the supplemental judgment in which the trial court awarded plaintiff $4,249,665.49 in attorney fees. Because we reverse the general judgment, we necessarily reverse the supplemental judgment. ORS 20.220(3) (\u201cWhen an appeal is taken from a judgment under ORS 19.205 to which an award of attorney fees or costs and disbursements relates: (a) If the appellate court reverses the judgment, the award of attorney fees or costs and disbursements shall be deemed reversed!.]\u201d). However, because plaintiff remains the prevailing party on his claims except for the imposition of the off-the-clock claims penalties, the issues surrounding an award of attorney fees are likely to arise on remand. We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"810\">*810</page-number>therefore address some of the errors in the supplemental judgment with regard to the statutory authority and the finding supporting the multiplier enhancement. <em>See ZRZ Realty v. Beneficial Fire and Casualty Ins., </em>257 Or App 180, 306 P3d 661, <em>rev den, </em>354 Or 491 (2013) (on petition for reconsideration, noting that we had given \u201cthe trial court and the parties further guidance on those attorney fee issues likely to arise on remand\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b832-4\">The trial court determined that three statutes entitled plaintiff to the entire attorney fee award, each on separate and independent grounds. Those entitlement statutes are: (1) ORS 652.200(2) (generally, entitlement to attorney fees in an action for unpaid wages unless the \u201cplaintiffs attorney unreasonably failed to give written notice of the wage claim to the employer before filing the action\u201d); (2) ORS 653.055(4) (for actions in which an employee is entitled to wages under ORS 653.010 to 653.261, the \u201ccourt may award reasonable attorney fees to the prevailing party\u201d); and (3) ORS 20.105 (attorney fees for the prevailing party in which the other party \u201cwillfully disobeyed a court order\u201d or lacked an \u201cobjectively reasonable basis for asserting the claim, defense or ground for appeal\u201d). Concluding that the award of attorney fees was deficient in several respects, we note the following points about the grounds for an award.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-5\">First, as to the entitlement of attorney fees under ORS 652.200(2), the prelitigation notice letter sent to the employer regarding plaintiffs claims was deficient for the same reason that we concluded that the prelitigation letter was deficient in <em>Belknap v. U. S. Bank National Association, </em>235 Or App 658, 672, 234 P3d 1041 (2010), <em>rev den, </em>349 Or 654 (2011). That is, the specific name of the plaintiff or plaintiffs was required to be included so that an employer would have an opportunity to resolve the claim before litigation. The facts of this case are materially indistinguishable from those in <em>Belknap, </em>and, accordingly, plaintiff is not entitled to attorney fees under ORS 652.200(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b832-6\">Second, as to the entitlement of attorney fees under ORS 653.055(4), because plaintiff did not prevail on all of his claims (specifically, he failed to prevail on his meal- and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"811\">*811</page-number>rest-break claims), the judgment is required to comply with ORS 20.077, namely, the court was required to determine the prevailing party on each separate claim and then decide whether to award attorney fees on the prevailing claims and the amount to be awarded. <em>See Robert Camel Contracting, Inc. v. Krautscheid, </em>205 Or App 498, 503, 134 P3d 1065 (2006) (in actions involving multiple claims, ORS 20.077 requires that the court \u201cdetermine the prevailing party on each claim and award attorney fees accordingly\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b833-3\">Third, as to the entitlement of attorney fees under ORS 20.105, fees authorized under that statute must be apportioned to the particular willful disobedience of a court order or the particular legal position that was without an objectively reasonable basis: The general rule that attorney fee entitlement statutes must apportion authorized and unauthorized fees applies to ORS 20.105. <em>See Lovejoy Specialty Hospital v. Advocates for Life, </em>121 Or App 160, 168, 855 P2d 159, <em>rev den, </em>318 Or 97; 318 Or 98 (1993), <em>cert den, </em>511 US 1070 (1994) (so stating).</p>\n<p id=\"b833-4\">We turn to the matter of the multiplier enhancement of the attorney fee. The trial court considered the factors set out in ORS 20.075 and used the \u201clodestar\u201d method of calculation (a reasonable hourly rate and a reasonable number of hours devoted to work on the case, <em>Strawn v. Farmers Ins. Co., </em>353 Or 210, 217, 297 P3d 439 (2013)), and determined a lodestar attorney fee amount of $2,124,833, finding that the appropriate hourly rate for plaintiffs partner-level attorneys was $495. The court determined that an enhanced <em>double </em>multiplier was justified, resulting in an attorney fee award of $4,249,665, because of the \u201cnovelty and difficulty, the risks involved (including this being a zero offer case), the excellent results obtained for the plaintiff class, and the experience, efficiency, ability and skill of Plaintiffs counsel!,]\u201d and to \u201cdeter others from engaging in objectively unreasonable conduct, which would include willfully violating multiple court orders, and continuing to assert meritless legal arguments and materially inaccurate false statements, as Defendant and its counsel have done in this case.\u201d When the trial court reexamines the fee award, we provide the following guidance about an enhanced multiplier of that award.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"812\">*812</page-number>First, when awarding fees, a court\u2019s findings must be adequate to allow meaningful appellate review. <em>Grisby v. Progressive Preferred Ins. Co., </em>233 Or App 210, 222, 225 P3d 101 (2010) (as to reduction of attorney fees that are otherwise reasonable, \u201csome explanation by trial courts in that regard greatly assists this court in exercising its review function consistently with the dictates of <em>McCarthy v. Oregon Freeze Dry, Inc., </em>327 Or 185, 187-88, 957 P2d 1200 (1998)\u201d). That is, a court must set out in its findings \u201cthe relevant facts and legal criteria on which the court relies in awarding attorney fees.\u201d <em>McCarthy, </em>327 Or at 190. Here, the court\u2019s findings justifying the multiplier fails to set out the facts or legal criteria on which the court relied and, thus, lack the requisite degree of specificity to allow review.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-4\">Second, in <em>Grisby, </em>233 Or App at 222, we stated that \u201ca court\u2019s discretionary authority to reduce requested attorney fees that are otherwise reasonable * * * is subject to principled constraints. In particular, there must be a rational nexus between the factor invoked, and its underlying circumstances, and the amount of the reduction.\u201d <em>See, e.g., </em>ORS 20.075. Those constraints likewise apply to the court\u2019s authority to enhance a requested attorney fee award. We also note that, to the extent that any multiplier or enhancement is based on counsel\u2019s improper conduct, the trial court must also consider the enhancement in light of whether fees have been already awarded under ORS 20.105.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-5\">Finally, we acknowledge the Supreme Court\u2019s discussion of a lodestar fee and enhancement multiplier in <em>Strawn, </em>353 Or at 222-31. The court rejected applying a multiplier in a circumstance in which the plaintiff asserted that the lodestar method would compensate his lawyers <em>less </em>than what he had agreed to pay them on a contingency fee basis. <em>Id. </em>at 226. Here, the multiplier and the lodestar fee calculation combined for an award that greatly exceeded what would have been the contingency percentage of the award and was roughly double the amount of damages and civil penalties awarded to plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-6\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b834-7\">In sum, we affirm the trial court\u2019s certification of the classes but reverse and remand the imposition of statutory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"813\">*813</page-number>penalties as to the off-the-clock claims. The supplemental judgment for attorney fees is reversed and remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-4\">Reconsideration of order of Appellate Commissioner denying motion to dismiss allowed; previous order denying motion to dismiss adhered to. On appeal, (1) general judgment reversed and remanded as to off-the-clock claim penalties; otherwise affirmed; (2) supplemental judgment reversed and remanded. On cross-appeal, affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b799-5\"> Our disposition as to defendant\u2019s third and fourth assignments obviates the need to address defendant\u2019s sixth assignment of error, which asserts that the federal due process limits for punitive damages set forth in <em>BMW of North America, Inc. v. Gore, </em>517 US 559, 568, 116 S Ct 1589, 134 L Ed 2d 809 (1996), apply to the statutory penalties imposed as to the off-the-clock claims.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b799-6\"> In 2005, claims similar to those pleaded in this case were filed in a separate action against defendant, <em>Joarnt v. AutoZone, </em>also in Multnomah County Circuit Court (Case Number 0503-02795). The judge in this case was originally assigned to the <em>Joarnt </em>action; the Multnomah County Circuit Court presiding judge disqualified him from that case and reassigned it to another judge. The additional civil penalties tolled under ORCP 32 N for the <em>Joarnt </em>claims totaled $862,894.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b800-8\"> Plaintiff moved to dismiss defendant\u2019s appeal on the ground that its notice of appeal was untimely. The appellate commissioner denied the motion, and plaintiff moved for reconsideration of the order. The acting chief judge deferred the motion to the merits panel. We conclude that the commissioner properly denied the motion. Accordingly, we allow reconsideration and adhere to the commissioner\u2019s prior order.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b806-8\"> On appeal, plaintiff argues that defendant\u2019s motion made after the jury verdict was barred under ORCP 32 C(l), which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b806-9\">\u201cAs soon as practicable after the commencement of an action brought as a class action, the court shall determine by order whether and with respect to what claims or issues it is to be so maintained and shall find the facts specially and state separately its conclusions thereon. <em>An order under this section may be conditional, and may be altered or amended before the decision on the merits.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b806-10\">(Emphasis added.) According to plaintiff, because the jury verdict was a \u201cdecision on the merits,\u201d ORCP 32 C(l) precludes decertification because doing so would alter or amend the class. Because the trial court denied defendant\u2019s renewed motion to decertify on the grounds that <em>Wal-Mart </em>is \u201cdistinguishable and otherwise not controlling authority,\u201d we affirm its determination on that basis and do not reach whether ORCP 32 allows post-jury verdict decertification.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b807-6\"> As to unpaid travel time between stores, defendant points to the fact that the jury was not persuaded by the class representative\u2019s travel time claim. Defendant\u2019s argument is not sufficiently developed to allow us to address it, and we therefore reject it without further discussion. <em>See Beall Transport Equipment Co. v. Southern Pacific, </em>186 Or App 696, 700 n 2, 64 P3d 1193, <em>adh\u2019d, to on recons, </em>187 Or App 472, 68 P3d 259 (2003) (it is not \u201cour proper function to make or develop a party\u2019s argument when that party has not endeavored to do so itself\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b809-6\"> We note that the court instructed the jury that the class members had to prove that they were unpaid for periods of authorized attendance at their scheduled time, or while they were engaged in time worked when they were on defendant\u2019s premises. Moreover, the trial defined \u201cworktime\u201d to the jury as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b809-7\">\u201cincluding] both time worked, and time of authorized attendance. Worktime and hours worked are all hours for which an employee is employed by, and required to give, to the employer, and includes all time during which an employee is necessarily required to be on the employer\u2019s premises on duty, or at a prescribed workplace, and all time the employee is suffered or permitted to work. Work requested or required is considered worktime. Work not requested, but suffered or permitted is also considered worktime.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b810-5\"> ORS 652.140 provides, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b810-6\">\u201c(1) When an employer discharges an employee or when employment is terminated by mutual agreement, all wages earned and unpaid at the time of the discharge or termination become due and payable not later than the end of the first business day after the discharge or termination.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b810-7\">\u201c(2)(a) When an employee who does not have a contract for a definite period quits employment, all wages earned and unpaid at the time of quitting become due and payable immediately if the employee has given to the employer not less than 48 hours\u2019 notice, excluding Saturdays, Sundays and holidays, of intention to quit employment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b810-8\">\u201c(b) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this subsection, if the employee has not given to the employer the notice described in paragraph (a) of this subsection, the wages become due and payable within five days, excluding Saturdays, Sundays and holidays, after the employee has quit, or at the next regularly scheduled payday after the employee has quit, whichever event first occurs.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b810-9\">\u201c(c) If the employee has not given to the employer the notice described in paragraph (a) of this subsection and if the employee is regularly required to submit time records to the employer to enable the employer to determine the wages due the employee, within five days after the employee has quit the employer shall pay the employee the wages the employer estimates are due and payable. Within five days after the employee has submitted the time records, all wages earned and unpaid become due and payable.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b812-6\"> In <em>Wilson, </em>we considered whether the employer\u2019s failure to timely pay wages was willful, for purposes of imposing penalties under ORS 652.150, when it sold the facility in which the plaintiffs had worked. 197 Or App at 659. In that case, the employer\u2019s obligation to pay severance pay was set out in a collective bargaining agreement, and the employer argued that its failure to pay severance as final wages was not triggered because it was not aware of its obligation to pay until the Ninth Circuit affirmed an arbitrator\u2019s interpretation of a term of the CBA. <em>Id. </em>at 653-54, 666. Concluding that an employer willfully fails to pay wages \u201cwhen it knows or reasonably should know all the facts that trigger the obligation under ORS 652.150,\u201d we held that the employer should have reasonably known of its obligation to pay severance benefits once the arbitrator rendered a decision construing the CBA. <em>Id. </em>at 665-67 (emphasis added). Even if defendant had preserved its argument on appeal, it has failed to sufficiently develop an argument that explains how our holding in <em>Wilson </em>applies to the argument it raises on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-7\">We also note that, as to the final-wages claim, the trial court differentiated claims with 48 hours\u2019 notice and without 48 hours\u2019 notice when it instructed the jury.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b812-8\"> We reject that argument directed at the sufficiency of the evidence because it poses a different question from the one we must answer on appeal. That is, the question here is whether the requirements of commonality or predominance are satisfied and not whether defendant was entitled to a directed verdict. <em>See Delgado, </em>260 Or App at 491 n 3 (\u201cDefendant\u2019s arguments as briefed *** focus on the sufficiency of the evidence to send the issues to the jury, a different question.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b813-5\"> Three categories of penalties were imposed by the trial court. Type 4 penalties were imposed under ORS 652.150 on the final-wages claim, i.e., <em>untimely </em>providing final wages, for violating ORS 652.140. The jury found that that violation was willful, and defendant does not challenge that penalty on appeal. Type 3 penalties concerned the off-the-clock claims and were also imposed under ORS 652.150 and ORS 652.140, but the penalties were for the failure to provide unpaid regular wages upon termination of employment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b813-6\"> ORCP 59 H provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b813-7\">\u201c(1) \u215c \u215c * A party may not obtain appellate review of an asserted error by a trial court in submitting or refusing to submit a statement of issues to a jury pursuant to subsection C(2) of this rule or in giving or refusing to give an instruction to a jury unless the party seeking review identified the asserted error to the trial court and made a notation of exception immediately after the court instructed the jury or at such other time as the trial court directed.

As to an issue omitted without such demand, the court may make a finding; or, if it fails to do so, it shall be deemed to have made a finding in accord with the judgment on the special verdict.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b817-6\"> Plaintiff also relies on <em>Delgado, </em>260 Or App 480, for that point, but <em>Delgado </em>does not assist plaintiff. In <em>Delgado, </em>the defendant argued on appeal that the trial court erred when it awarded statutory penalty wages on summary judgment because whether it was an \u201cemployer\u201d (as defined by ORS 652.310) of the class members for the purpose of ORS 652.150 was a factual issue that should have been decided by the jury. 260 Or App at 494. However, in <em>Delgado, </em>the defendant failed to assert that argument at any point in the proceedings below and thus, we concluded that the defendant waived the right to a jury trial on that issue under ORCP 61 B because it failed to demand submission of the issue to the jury. <em>Id. </em>at 499.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b818-8\"> Subsection (2) concerns an employer\u2019s liability with respect to an employee\u2019s notice of nonpayment and subsection (3) concerns the payment of commissions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b821-8\"> Plaintiff relies on our decision, <em>Cornier v. Paul Tulacz, DVM PC, </em>176 Or App 245, 248, 30 P3d 1210 (2001), asserting that because we concluded that ORS 652.150 and ORS 653.055 \u201cfall into two categories: statutes dealing with failure to pay wages owed at termination and statutes dealing with failure to pay overtime!,]\u201d it necessarily follows that any provision of ORS 652.150 that does not concern the calculation of penalties is not effective when penalties are assessed under ORS 653.055(1). In <em>Cornier, </em>we held that an employee was entitled to penalties for both her employee\u2019s failure to pay overtime at the overtime rate, ORS 653.261, and for her employer\u2019s late payment of accrued vacation pay. Although it is true that ORS 653.055(1) is available as a penalty before an employee\u2019s termination, a finding of willfulness does not preclude the imposition of the two types of penalties as we held in <em>Cornier. </em>And, although it appears that the trial court in that case did not require a finding of willfulness as to the overtime violation, we neither addressed nor decided that issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b824-5\"> We caution against relying on this legislative history to establish what mental state is required to establish willfulness. That inquiry would be better served by relying on the legislative history of ORS 652.150 itself, or Oregon case law, <em>see, e.g., Wilson, </em>197 Or App at 659-67; <em>Young v.
