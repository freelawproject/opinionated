J.</author>\n<p id=\"b74-4\">Defendant, who was adjudicated for contempt, ORS 33.015(2)(b), based on a violation of a restraining order issued pursuant to the Family Abuse Protection Act (FAPA), ORS 107.718, appeals. She contends that, in adjudicating her, the trial court rendered findings that not only contradicted, but precluded as a matter of law, a determination that the asserted violation was \u201cdone willfully.\u201d ORS 33.015(2)(b).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We agree. Specifically, as amplified below, the trial court\u2019s findings were irreconcilable with the legislatively intended content of \u201cwillfully\u201d in this context. Accordingly, we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-5\">We recite the material facts in the light most favorable to the state, consistently with the trial court\u2019s express findings. In March 2014, defendant\u2019s estranged husband, T, obtained a FAPA restraining order, which provided, <em>inter alia, </em>that defendant, as respondent, \u201cshall not knowingly be or stay within 200 feet\u201d of T and prohibited defendant from \u201c [c] ontacting, or attempting to contact, [T] in person.\u201d (Boldface omitted.)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In May and June of 2014, T, through a third person, communicated to defendant that he would like to attempt a reconciliation, to \u201cpatch things up,\u201d and proposed that they take a family trip together, with their young son, to the coast over Father\u2019s Day weekend. Defendant was aware of the existence of the restraining order and agreed to direct contact, including the proposed trip, only upon the restraining order being \u201cdropped.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b74-6\">On either the Wednesday or Thursday before Father\u2019s Day, T, via email, informed defendant that he was \u201cat the courthouse\u201d with a coworker and \u201cin the process of\u2019 dismissing the FAPA order. On the Friday before Father\u2019s Day, T presented defendant with \u201ca new wedding ring,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>because (in defendant\u2019s words) \u201cwe thought that we were going to for sure work things out.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b75-3\">Before leaving for the coast for the weekend with T and their son, defendant did not contact the court to confirm T\u2019s representations regarding dismissal of the FAPA order. In defendant\u2019s view, she had no reason to disbelieve T, \u201cbecause he wanted to be [with] the family. He wanted me * * * back fully in his life,\u201d \u201cespecially seeing as he did buy me a wedding ring [that] Friday.\u201d In fact, the FAPA order had not been dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-4\">On Saturday, June 14, the day before Father\u2019s Day, defendant and T were stopped for a traffic violation while riding ATVs together in Winchester Bay. When the officer who made the stop checked with dispatch, he learned of the FAPA order, which was still in effect. When the officer so informed defendant, she was \u201cupset\u201d and protested, telling him that T had \u201cgone to the court or to a government agency to have the restraining order dropped so they could spend more time as a family.\u201d T also protested, saying that he had \u201cdropped it,\u201d but the officer replied that, without some confirmation that the order had been dismissed, he would have to take defendant into custody\u2014which he did.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-5\">At the time of her arrest, defendant did not believe that the FAPA order was still in effect. A judgment dismissing the FAPA order was entered on June 19.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b75-6\">On July 1, defendant was charged, by a district attorney\u2019s information, with contempt, ORS 33.015(2)(b), based on the violation of the FAPA order. The matter was tried to the court. In closing argument, defense counsel argued that, if the court credited defendant\u2019s account, it could not adjudicate her for contempt, because defendant\u2019s contemporaneous <em>understanding\u2014viz., </em>that \u201c[s]he earnestly believed the restraining order had been dropped\u201d\u2014precluded the requisite determination that she had willfully violated the FAPA order. The prosecutor countered that, because defendant had insufficient information \u201cto know that the restraining <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>order wasn\u2019t in place,\u201d \u201c[t]he onus [was] on her\u201d to \"check, to call [the court], and to make sure that [it] wasn\u2019t.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b76-4\">The trial court, while explicitly crediting defendant\u2019s account, nevertheless adjudicated her for contempt:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b76-5\">\u201c[I]n listening to the testimony here today, you know, <em>it\u2019s very clear that, [defendant], that you had believed what someone else told you. </em>However, the order was issued by the Court, and only until the Court, the Judge, signs that order dismissing it is the restraining order actually dismissed. And you did not take the steps to protect yourself in that instance, and I find it very telling that [T]\u2014even after you had been arrested on the 14th, that it took him five more days to actually go to the court and file a motion to dismiss. * * * But on the day that the deputy contacted you and you were well within 100 feet of [T], that restraining order had not been dismissed. It was still in effect. And based on that, I do find you in contempt of court. I do find that you willfully violated that order of the Court. You did not verify that the Court had signed a dismissal, and so I do find you in contempt.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b76-6\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b76-7\">On appeal, defendant substantially reiterates her position before the trial court, with the refinement, in the light of the trial court\u2019s finding as to defendant\u2019s contemporaneous good faith belief, that that finding precludes an adjudication of contempt. The state remonstrates that (1) that contention was unpreserved, because defense counsel expressed no objection after the trial court rendered its \u201cspeaking verdict\u201d; and (2) in all events, there is no essential contradiction between the trial court\u2019s findings and a determination of a willful violation of the FAPA order.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-8\">The state\u2019s threshold nonpreservation response is unavailing. In this case, defense counsel contended in closing argument that, if the trial court found the facts in a certain fashion <em>(viz., </em>if the court believed defendant\u2019s account), then it could not determine that her violation of the FAPA order was willful and, hence, contumacious. <em>See </em>282 Or App at 53. That contention, necessarily, was not framed or phrased as a motion for judgment of acquittal, because, after all, the court was free to disbelieve defendant. Rather, it was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>posited in functionally \u201cmatter-of-law\u201d terms: If \u201cA\u201d (factually), then not \u201cB\u201d (\u201cdone willfully\u2019\u2019/contempt). The prosecutor so understood, and engaged with, that fundamental contention, asserting that, regardless of defendant\u2019s subjective good faith belief, her failure to verify that the order had not been set aside rendered her noncomplicance \u201cwillful.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Ultimately, the trial court, while explicitly finding the facts pertaining to defendant\u2019s contemporaneous understanding to be as she had represented, endorsed the state\u2019s legal position. Given that posture, a further objection by defense counsel, reiterating the legal premise of his closing argument, would not have served the prudential underpinnings of the preservation requirement.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b77-4\">We proceed to the merits. As noted above, the state contends that, for several reasons, the trial court\u2019s statement crediting defendant\u2019s testimony as to her contemporaneous belief was not necessarily legally irreconcilable with a determination of willfulness. The state first contends that the trial court\u2019s statement did not constitute a finding that defendant believed that the FAPA order was no longer in effect. Specifically, the state asserts that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b77-5\">\u201cwhen the trial court credited defendant\u2019s testimony by finding that she \u2018believed what someone had told\u2019 her, the court was referring to defendant\u2019s belief in her husband\u2019s statement about what he <em>intended </em>to do, not what he <em>had </em>done.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b77-6\">(Emphases in original.)</p>\n<p id=\"b77-7\">We respectfully reject that parsing. T\u2019s statements to defendant, which the court expressly found that she believed, were not that he intended to have the order set <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>aside at some future date. Rather, what he told defendant was that he was \u201cat the courthouse,\u201d \u201cin the process of\u2019 having the order dismissed. That is, defendant believed T when he said he was presently engaged in having the FAPA order set aside.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-4\">In that light, and read in their entirety, the court\u2019s statements express a determination that defendant actually, and in good faith, believed that the order had been set aside, but, nevertheless, in the totality of the circumstances\u2014 and, as the prosecutor had argued\u2014\u201c[t]he onus [was] on [defendant] to make sure\u201d that the order had, in fact, been dismissed. <em>See </em>282 Or App at 54. Indeed, if the state\u2019s construction were correct, then the trial court\u2019s emphasis on defendant\u2019s failure to verify the order\u2019s dismissal would have been gratuitous. That is, if the trial court discredited defendant\u2019s testimony that she believed that the order was no longer in effect, then that alone would have established willfulness, without reference to any failure to verify the order\u2019s dismissal. We note, finally, that our construction of the court\u2019s finding is corroborated by the tenor of the court\u2019s observations in imposing sentence:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b78-5\">\u201c[Ht\u2019s unfortunate that you took the word of\u2014I mean, at the time he was your husband still, although you had been separated. You took his word without verifying on your own, especially because of the situation that you both were in.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b78-6\">We turn, then, to the fundamental substantive dispute here: Did defendant\u2019s subjective, good faith contemporaneous understanding that the FAPA order was no longer in effect preclude a determination of willful noncompliance and, hence, an adjudication of contempt?</p>\n<p id=\"b78-7\">ORS 33.015(2) provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b78-8\">\u201c\u2018Contempt of court\u2019 means the following acts, done willfully:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b78-9\">\u00ab\u215c\u215c\u215c\u2021\u215c</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b78-10\">\u201c(b) Disobedience of, resistance to or obstruction of the court\u2019s authority, process, orders or judgments.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b78-11\">There is no statutory definition of \u201cwillfully\u201d for purposes of ORS 33.015(2). Indeed, that mental state element was not specified in the text of Oregon\u2019s contempt statutes, including <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>the antecedent <em>former </em>ORS 33.010(1)(e),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> until the enactment of ORS 33.015 in 1991.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Before then, it was engrafted by judicial decisions. <em>See generally State ex rel Mikkelsen v. Hill, </em>315 Or 452, 456-57, 847 P2d 402 (1993) (describing history); <em>cf. Couey and Couey, </em>312 Or 302, 304, 821 P2d 1086 (1991) (noting, with reference to <em>former </em>ORS 33.010(1)(e), \u201c[although the word \u2018willfully\u2019 does not appear on the face of the statute, this court long has recognized the requirement of\u2018willfulness\u2019\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b79-4\">\u201cWillful\u201d and \u201cwillfully\u201d are notoriously elusive terms, with their content varying qualitatively and dramatically in different contexts. <em>See generally </em>David Welkowitz, <em>Willfulness\u2122, </em>79 Alb L Rev 509 (2016) (addressing \u201cchameleon-like\u201d quality of term in different contexts generally, and trademark law specifically); <em>Id. </em>at 509 n 2 (noting Judge Learned Hand\u2019s deprecation of \u201cwillful,\u201d in context of Model Penal Code debate, as \u201ca very dreadful word,\u201d \u201can awful word,\u201d and \u201cone of the most troublesome words in a statute that I know of\u2019). Thus, while general and legal dictionaries define the term as incorporating a component of intentionality,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Oregon law in some noncriminal contexts deems merely negligent conduct to have been \u201cwillful.\u201d <em>See, e.g., </em>ORS 646.605(10) (defining \u201cwillful\u201d for purposes of the Unfair Trade Practices Act: \u201cA willful violation occurs when the person committing the violation knew <em>or should have known </em>that the conduct of the person was a violation.\u201d (Emphasis added.)).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> It was because of that imprecision that, although <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>Oregon\u2019s criminal statutes had historically included a definition of \u201cwilfully,\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> that definition was deleted as part of the 1971 omnibus Criminal Code revisions.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b80-4\">Notwithstanding that lack of .textual definition, the legislative history of Senate Bill (SB) 376 (1991), codified in pertinent part as ORS 33.015(2), is conclusive as to the content of \u201cwillfully\u201d in this context. SB 376 embodied a complete overhaul of Oregon\u2019s contempt statutes. Tape Recording, Senate Committee on Judiciary, SB 376, Feb 6, 1991, Tape 21, Side A (comment of Ingrid Swenson, Committee Counsel; statements of William Linden, State Court Administrator, and David Heynderickx, Legislative Counsel\u2019s Office). The legislature\u2019s consideration of the measure\u2014and, specifically, its inclusion of a \u201cwillful\u201d mental state\u2014occurred in the immediate wake of our decision in <em>Couey and Couey, </em>105 Or App 478, 805 P2d 716 (1991), which the Supreme Court reversed in <em>Couey, </em>312 Or 302.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b80-5\">As noted, the text of the antecedent contempt statute did not include a reference to willfulness\u2014or, for that matter, to any culpable mental state\u2014but judicial decisions had incorporated and applied a willfulness requirement. For example, in <em>Rust v. Pratt, </em>157 Or 505, 510, 72 P2d 533 (1937), <em>appeal dismissed, </em>303 US 621, 58 S Ct 648, 82 L Ed 1084 (1938), the Supreme Court quoted with approval the trial court\u2019s statement that contempt \u201cis the wilful disregard <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>of the authority of a court of justice.\u201d The next year, in <em>State ex rel Grover v. Grover, </em>158 Or 635, 639, 77 P2d 430 (1938), the court quoted, with apparent approval, the United States Supreme Court\u2019s statement in <em>Felton v. United States, </em>96 US 699, 702, 24 L Ed 875 (1877), that \u201c[d]oing or omitting to do a thing knowingly and wilfully, implies not only a knowledge of the thing, <em>but a determination with a bad intent </em>to do it or to omit doing it.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The Oregon Supreme Court subsequently, repeatedly reiterated the <em>Grover/Felton </em>formulation. <em>See Couey, </em>312 Or at 305 (citing cases).</p>\n<p id=\"b81-4\">In <em>Couey, </em>the defendant appealed from a judgment of criminal contempt imposed for failure to pay child support. 105 Or App at 480. The trial court, in adjudicating the defendant, observed, \u201cI don\u2019t think you intentionally set out to cheat your ex-wife of the support.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 481. On appeal, the defendant argued that, given that comment, he could not be deemed to have acted willfully. <em>Id. </em>We reversed and remanded, reasoning, under our understanding of the <em>Grover/Felton </em>standard, that \u201cwilfully\u201d and \u201cwith bad intent\u201d were distinct and conjunctive requirements and that the trial court had failed to address the latter:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-5\">\u201cThere was sufficient evidence to support the trial court\u2019s determination that defendant acted wilfully. The court, however, did not make a finding whether, in disobeying the support order, defendant acted with bad intent. The state contends that a finding of wilfullness automatically includes a finding of bad intent. However, because a finding of wilfullness alone does not necessarily show that a contemnor acted with bad intent, a separate finding of bad intent is required to support a contempt judgment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b81-6\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b81-7\">The state petitioned for review, and the matter was in that posture as the 1991 Oregon Legislature considered whether, as originally proposed in SB 376, the statute should prescribe a \u201cwillful\u201d culpable mental state<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> and, if so, the intended content of that term. Initially, some legislators expressed the view that the proposed \u201cdone willfully\u201d language should be supplemented with \u201cwith bad intent\u201d\u2014 and, indeed, the Senate Judiciary Committee initially, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>provisionally, approved such an amendment. Tape Recording, Senate Committee on Judiciary, SB 376, Mar 25,1991, Tape 72, Side A (comments of Sen Jim Bunn, Sen Jim Hill, and Sen Bob Shoemaker).</p>\n<p id=\"b82-4\">A week later\u2014and critically to our consideration here\u2014the committee revisited that matter at length. Tape Recording, Senate Committee on Judiciary, SB 376, Apr 1, 1991, Tape 83, Side A, Tape 84, Side A. At that time, the committee received testimony from Assistant Attorney General Jas. Adams, appellate counsel for the state in <em>Couey. </em>In an extended colloquy, Adams urged the committee not to include \u201cbad intent\u201d as a conjunctive requirement, contending that, because (contrary to our analysis in Couey) the concept of \u201cbad intent\u201d was incorporated into \u201cwillful,\u201d no separate finding of \u201cbad intent\u201d should be required. <em>Id. </em>at Tape 83, Side A (statement of Assistant Attorney General, Jas. Adams).</p>\n<p id=\"b82-5\">Committee members focused on the meaning of \u201cwillful\u201d\u2014that is, whether, if the previously approved amendment adding \u201cbad intent\u201d were rescinded, \u201cdone willfully\u201d would sufficiently express the legislatively intended mental state. In doing so, they explicitly recognized that, regardless of the Supreme Court\u2019s ultimate decision in <em>Couey, </em>legislative intent would control judicial construction of \u201cwillfully\u201d in SB 376, if enacted. <em>Id. </em>at Tape 84, Side A <em>{e.g., </em>comment of Sen Shoemaker, observing that whatever the Supreme Court ultimately ruled in <em>Couey, </em>\u201cfrom this point on, whatever we say, if the legislature agrees, it goes\u2014not what the [Supreme Court] says, because this is statutory\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b82-6\">Proceeding from that premise, Senator Shoemaker posited that \u201cwillful\u201d meant \u201c[i]ntentional, and <em>with knowledge that what you are doing is </em>forbidden.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added). Adams agreed, stating that, while \u201cbad intent\u201d was \u201cmisleading,\u201d as implicating motive, contempt is \u201csimply the deliberate flouting of a binding court order.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Senator Shoemaker then moved to retain \u201cwillfully\u201d (without reference to \u201cbad intent\u201d), defined as: \u201cintentionally and <em>with knowledge that it was forbidden </em>conduct.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added). The committee\u2019s chairperson, Senator Joyce Cohen, concurred, with the observation that the expressed definition <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>\u201cwould not go into the statute, but represented for clarifying legislative history.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(comment of Sen Cohen). With that understanding, the committee approved Senator Shoemaker\u2019s motion. <em>Id. </em>There appears to be no other legislative discussion bearing materially on the meaning of \u201cdone willfully\u201d in SB 376.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-4\">In December 1991, long after the end of the legislative session, the Supreme Court issued its decision in <em>Couey, </em>reversing our holding. The court concluded that \u201cwillfully\u201d and \u201cwith bad intent\u201d were not distinct and conjunctive concepts for purposes of <em>former </em>ORS 33.010 (l)(e). Rather,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b83-5\">\u201c[f|or purpose of <em>former </em>ORS 33.010(l)(e), a <em>prima facie </em>case of contempt is shown by proof of: (1) the existence of a valid court order; (2) the contemnor\u2019s knowledge of the order; and (3) voluntary noncompliance with the order. In this context, a finding of willful disobedience of a valid court order <em>is </em>a finding that the contemnor acted with bad intent and is sufficient to support a contempt judgment. We hold that a trial court need not make separate findings regarding willfulness and bad intent to support a judgment of contempt.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b83-7\">312 Or at 306 (emphasis in original). In so holding, the court made it clear that it was addressing the application of only the former, repealed, statute, and not the newly-enacted ORS 33.015(2)(b). <em>Id. </em>at 304 n 1; <em>see also Mikkelsen, </em>315 Or at 454 n 1 (same). Thus, the Supreme Court in <em>Couey </em>had no occasion to address the meaning of \u201cwillfully\u201d in ORS 33.015(2), as informed by its legislative history.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-8\">Over the years since <em>Couey, </em>in cases implicating ORS 33.015(2), we have repeatedly referred to Couey\u2019s formulation, without reference to the legislative history of that statute. <em>See, e.g., State v. Crombie, </em>267 Or App 705, 710, 341 P3d 841 (2014) (citing cases). Indeed, it appears that we have never addressed and applied that history.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-9\">Consistently with the dictates of <em>State v. Gaines, </em>346 Or 160, 171-72, 206 P3d 1042 (2009), we do so now. We readily appreciate that an expression of understanding within a single legislative committee is less than optimal legislative history. <em>Id. </em>at 172 n 9 (quoting with approval <em>Errand v. Cascade Steel Rolling Mills, Inc., </em>320 Or 509, 539 n 4, 888 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>P2d 544 (1995) (Graber, J., dissenting)).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Nevertheless, the understanding that \u201cwillfully\u201d for purposes of ORS 33.015(2) meant, and means, \u201cintentionally and with knowledge that [the act or omission] was forbidden conduct\u201d was the product of substantial collegial consideration and was expressly memorialized as legislative history to provide definitional guidance. That contextually specific definition of an otherwise innately ambiguous term stands uncontradicted in the legislative record. Accordingly, it controls. <em>See State v. Kelly, </em>229 Or App 461, 467, 211 P3d 932, <em>rev den, </em>347 Or 446 (2009) (\u201c[T]he more clearly the history speaks to the meaning of the disputed terms in issue, the more weight the history will be accorded.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b84-4\">We note further, and finally, that that construction of \u201cwillfully\u201d in ORS 33.015(2) is not inconsistent with our applications of the <em>Couey </em>formulation, which have imported an element of conscious disregard of a judicial order or judgment. <em>See, e.g., Crombie, </em>267 Or App at 710 (noting that, to establish willful violation, state must prove that the \u201cdefendant knew about [a valid order] and <em>chose </em>not to comply with it\u201d; affirming contempt adjudication where \u201cthe record established] that [the defendant] <em>consciously chose </em>to [engage in the alleged contumacious conduct] despite knowing about the existence of the no-contact order\u201d (emphasis added)); <em>accord State v. Montgomery, </em>216 Or App 221, 172 P3d 279 (2007) (\u201caccidental\u201d violation of restraining order is not \u201cwillful\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b84-5\">We return to the circumstances of this case. A defendant who acts based on a good faith belief that a judicial order has been dismissed cannot be deemed to have acted \u201cwith knowledge that it was forbidden conduct.\u201d <em>See </em>282 Or App at 61-62. Such a defendant cannot be deemed to have acted \u201cwillfully\u201d for purposes of ORS 33.015(2)(b). Consequently, the trial court\u2019s finding here as to defendant\u2019s contemporaneous, good faith belief contradicted an adjudication of contempt.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-7\">\u201c[A]n examination of legislative history is most fraught with the potential for misconstruction, misattribution of the beliefs of a single legislator or witness to the body as a whole, or abuse in the form of\u2018padding the record\u2019 when the views of only a small number of persons on a narrow question can be found.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b85-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>There are no unresolved factual issues on this record whose determination in the event of remand could establish an alternative basis for adjudication of contempt as charged. <em>See State v.
