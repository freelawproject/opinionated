J.</author>\n<p id=\"b443-4\">The question in this workers\u2019 compensation case is whether the Workers\u2019 Compensation Board erred in concluding that claimant is entitled to compensation for temporary partial disability from June 21, 2011 to September 28, 2011. In reviewing the board\u2019s order for substantial evidence and errors of law, ORS 656.298(7); ORS 183.482(7), (8), we conclude that the board erred and we therefore reverse and remand the award.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-5\">The facts are largely undisputed, and we draw them from the board\u2019s order and the medical record. Claimant suffered a compensable knee injury in 2008, and employer accepted a claim for a right knee medial meniscus tear. Claimant chose not to undergo surgical repair at that time, and he was treated with medication, a knee brace, and injections. The claim closed by a notice of closure in early 2009, with an award of two percent whole person impairment for loss of right knee range of motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-6\">Claimant continued to suffer knee pain. He returned to his doctor, who recommended surgery to repair the meniscus and, in March 2011, authorized modified work.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Claimant filed a claim for aggravation of the original injury, which employer denied on June 21, 2011, reasoning that claimant\u2019s condition had not changed since the 2009 claim closure. But in its letter to claimant denying the aggravation claim, employer wrote, \u201cPlease note that once you have undergone repair of the [medial] meniscus tear in your right knee, we will voluntarily reopen your claim for aggravation at that time.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b444-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>Claimant challenged employer\u2019s denial of the aggravation claim. An AL J upheld the denial and awarded claimant interim compensation on the aggravation claim from March 2011 until the date of the denial\u2014June 21, 2011.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The board issued an order upholding that denial in March 2013.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b444-3\">In the meantime, on September 28, 2011, claimant\u2019s physician performed a partial medial meniscectomy on claimant\u2019s right knee. Beneath the torn meniscus, the doctor found \u201can area of grade 3 chondromalacia of the tibial plateau,\u201d a wearing away of the cartilage secondary to a right medial meniscus tear. Claimant subsequently filed a new/omitted medical condition claim for right knee chon-dromalacia of the tibial plateau. Employer issued a notice accepting the claim in June 2012.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Employer closed the claim for right knee chondromalacia of the tibial plateau on September 12, 2012, after claimant\u2019s physician determined (in May 2012) that claimant\u2019s medial meniscus tear and degenerative changes, including chondromalacia, were medically stationary.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-4\">Upon closing that claim, employer awarded claimant temporary disability benefits from September 28, 2011 through September 12, 2012; nine percent whole person impairment; and 15 percent work disability. The updated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>notice of acceptance listed the accepted conditions as \u201cmedial meniscus tear of the right knee and right knee chondroma-lacia of the medial tibial plateau.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b445-4\">Claimant requested reconsideration, seeking additional temporary disability benefits. Limiting its consideration to the new/omitted medical condition claim of chon-dromalacia, the Appellate Review Unit (ARU) awarded claimant time loss from the day in March 2011 on which claimant\u2019s physician had authorized modified work through the day in May 2012 on which claimant\u2019s physician determined he was medically stationary.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b445-5\">Employer challenged the award of benefits for the period of June 21, 2011 through September 28, 2011. An ALJ and the board upheld the award. But unlike the ARU and the ALJ,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> the board did not connect claimant\u2019s time loss benefits to the chondromalacia. The board explained that, because it had not been identified as of the time of the authorizations, the chondromalacia could not provide a basis for the award. Nevertheless, the board concluded that claimant was entitled to benefits for temporary disability based on an accepted aggravation of the medial meniscus tear. The board found that, although employer had initially denied an aggravation claim for that condition, employer\u2019s reopening of the claim in June 2012 encompassed an acceptance of an aggravation of the medial meniscus based on the September 28, 2011, surgery.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> That voluntary reopening, the board reasoned, gave rise to an entitlement to temporary disability for the period during which claimant\u2019s attending physician <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>had authorized time loss for the medial meniscus. The board further found that, in releasing claimant for modified work from March 2011 through September 27, 2011, claimant\u2019s physician had authorized time loss for the medial meniscus tear.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-4\">On judicial review, employer challenges the board\u2019s determination. ORS 656.212 provides for payment of temporary partial disability benefits when a worker suffers temporary partial disability as a result of a compensable injury, as authorized by the worker\u2019s attending physician. ORS 656.262(4).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Employer contends that the additional time loss awarded by the board is not available for either the medial meniscus tear or the chondromalacia, and we agree. Employer had denied claimant\u2019s aggravation claim for the medial meniscus tear, and an ALJ and the board <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>had upheld that denial and awarded interim disability benefits to which claimant was entitled on that denied claim\u2014 time loss for the period between the filing of the claim and employer\u2019s denial on June 21, 2011. <em>See </em>ORS 656.262(4)(a) (describing an employer\u2019s obligation to pay time loss at the outset of claim during period for which there is authorization, pending acceptance or denial of the claim). At the time the board issued its order in this case in December 2013, a petition for judicial review of the March 2013 order denying the aggravation claim was pending in this court, and employer continued to assert that the aggravation claim was not compensable. To the extent that the documents relied on by the board support a finding that employer nonetheless voluntarily accepted an aggravation claim in June 2011 (a finding that employer does not dispute), the documents support a finding of an acceptance only as of the date of the September 2011 surgery, not before. Employer\u2019s statement in its letter denying the aggravation claim that it would voluntarily reopen the claim after claimant\u2019s surgery (\u201c[W]e will voluntarily reopen your claim for aggravation at that time[.]\u201d) can reasonably be viewed only as stating an expectation that the surgery itself would provide the basis for an aggravation\u2014not as an acceptance of an aggravation as of June 21, 2011, the date the claim was denied. Indeed, in its order on review, the board said that it was required to determine \u201cwhether the employer\u2019s claim reopening also included an aggravation of the medial meniscus tear based on the September 28, 2011, surgery.\u201d The board\u2019s finding that employer had accepted an aggravation claim <em>as of the date of the surgery </em>does not support an award of temporary disability benefits for the period before the surgery during which the claim was in denied status (a denial that the board upheld in an order that we affirmed). Thus, it could not support an award of time loss for the period of June 21, 2011 to September 28, 2011.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-4\">We also reject claimant\u2019s contention that there was medical authorization of temporary disability benefits for the new/omitted medical condition claim of chondromalacia for the period June 21,2011 to September 28, 2011. Although the ARU based its award of time loss on the chondromalacia, the board did not, with good reason. There is no evidence of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>an authorization of time loss for that claim before the date of the surgery. It is true, as claimant contends, that the statutes do not require that a physician\u2019s authorization of temporary disability benefits relate to a specific diagnosis. But the authorization must relate to a compensable condition. ORS 656.212; <em>see Scott v. Liberty Northwest Ins. Corp., </em>268 Or App 325, 330, 341 P3d 220 (2014) (describing two periods during which an entitlement to temporary disability benefits may arise, in addition to any interim compensation period, both of which relate to accepted claims that have not yet been closed); <em>Webb v. Glenbrook Nickel Co., </em>189 Or App 251, 256, 75 P3d 459 (2003) (duty to pay benefits was not triggered by authorization of time loss for a condition that was not compensable). As the board correctly stated, an authorization of time loss is not effective as to a denied condition. <em>See </em>ORS 656.262(4)(g). The presurgery authorizations provided by claimant\u2019s attending physician were directed to the medial meniscus tear, which had been denied and for which no compensation was due before September 28, 2011. The board therefore erred in awarding temporary disability benefits for the period June 21, 2011 through September 28, 2011.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-4\">Award of temporary disability benefits for the period June 21, 2011 through September 28, 2011, reversed and remanded; otherwise affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b443-7\"> Claimant\u2019s attending physician continued to authorize time loss through May 2012, when claimant\u2019s physician deemed him medically stationary.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b443-8\"> The letter stated, in substantive part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-9\">\u201cAfter review of your request for aggravation reopening we must hereby deny your aggravation claim for the following reason(s):</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-10\">\u201cPursuant to ORS 656.273, after the last award or arrangement of compensation, an injured worker is entitled to additional compensation for worsened conditions resulting from the original injury. * \u215c *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-11\">\u201cThe medical information in your file reflects that your symptoms and objective findings have been unchanged since the Notice of Closure issued in February of 2009.
