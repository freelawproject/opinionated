J.</author>\n<p id=\"b32-4\">The trial court convicted defendant of criminal mistreatment in the first degree and sentenced him to 20 months in prison and three years of post-prison supervision. In its written judgment, the trial court ordered defendant to \u201c [r] efrain from having contact or knowingly associating with the victim [.] \u201d Defendant appeals, raising six assignments of error. We write only to address defendant\u2019s fourth assignment of error, in which he asserts that the trial court \u201cplainly erred in imposing a no-contact provision as part of [the] judgment.\u201d We reject defendant\u2019s other assignments of error without written discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-5\">In support of his fourth assignment of error, defendant contends that the trial court imposed the no-contact provision either as a condition of incarceration or as a condition of post-prison supervision, and that it lacked authority to do so.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See State v. </em>Langmayer, 239 Or App 600, 601, 244 P3d 894 (2010) (trial courts lack authority to impose conditions of incarceration); <em>State v. Reed, </em>235 Or App 470, 474, 237 P3d 826 (2010) (trial courts lack authority to impose conditions of post-prison supervision). Defendant further contends that the error is apparent on the record and that we should exercise our discretion to correct it. <em>See </em>ORAP 5.45(1) (authorizing review of unpreserved errors apparent on the record); <em>State v. Brown, </em>310 Or 347, 355-56, 800 P2d 259 (1990) (articulating the standards for plain error review); <em>Ailes v. Portland Meadows, Inc., </em>312 Or 376, 382 n 6, 823 P2d 956 (1991) (identifying considerations relevant to whether appellate court should exercise its discretion to review a plain error). Defendant points out that we have done so in similar cases. <em>See, e.g., State v. Rubio/Galligan, </em>248 Or App 130, 139, 273 P3d 238, <em>rev den, </em>352 Or 107 (2012) (exercising discretion to correct erroneous no-contact <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>provision); <em>Reed, </em>235 Or App at 475-76 (exercising discretion to correct erroneous post-prison supervision condition prohibiting defendant from contacting the victim, her family, or any minor children).</p>\n<p id=\"b33-4\">The state concedes that \u201cthe trial court plainly erred by including the no-contact provision in the judgment and that this court may exercise its discretion to review it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b33-5\">We agree with the parties that the trial court plainly erred by imposing the no-contact provision and we exercise our discretion to correct the error. This case involves the imposition of an unauthorized provision, which neither party asserts an interest in maintaining. <em>See Ailes, </em>312 Or at 382 n 6 (in deciding whether to exercise discretion to correct plain error, a court may consider \u201cthe competing interests of the parties[,]\u201d among other factors). Additionally, as we noted in <em>Reed, </em>\u201csentencing [a] defendant according to the law serves the ends of justice [.] \u201d 235 Or App at 476; <em>see also Ailes, </em>312 Or at 382 n 6 (a court may also consider \u201cthe ends of justice in the particular case\u201d). Finally, this is not a case where, if defendant had objected, the record could have developed in a way that would have enabled the court to impose the condition. <em>See id. </em>(another factor a court may consider is \u201cwhether the policies behind the general rule requiring preservation of error have been served in the case in another way\u201d); <em>Peeples v. Lampert, </em>345 Or 209, 219, 191 P3d 637 (2008) (\u201c[P]reservation fosters full development of the record, which aids the trial court in making a decision and the appellate court in reviewing it.\u201d). Trial courts simply do not have the authority to impose conditions of incarceration or post-prison supervision.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-6\">Reversed and remanded for entry of a judgment omitting the challenged no-contact provision; otherwise affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b32-6\"> At the sentencing hearing, the state appears to have requested the no-contact provision as a condition of post-prison supervision; it asked the court to order defendant to \u201chave no contact with [the victim] during the\u2014when he\u2019s out.\u201d But the trial court appears to have imposed the no-contact provision as a condition of defendant\u2019s incarceration; it set out the prohibition in the section of the judgment entitled \u201cSentence Instructions,\u201d not the section entitled \u201cPost-Prison Supervision.\u201d <em>See State v. Langmayer, </em>239 Or App 600, 601, 244 P3d 894 (2010) (describing no-contact provision listed in \u201cSentence Instructions\u201d as a condition of incarceration).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
