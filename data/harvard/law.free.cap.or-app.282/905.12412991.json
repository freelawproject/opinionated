We reject his first assignment of error without written discussion,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> writing only to address petitioner\u2019s remaining assignment in which he asserts that the form of the post-conviction judgment did not comply with ORS 138.640(1), as construed in <em>Datt v. Hill, </em>347 Or 672, 227 P3d 714 (2010). Defendant concedes that the judgment was not <em>Datt </em>compliant, namely because the judgment does not clearly state the legal basis for the post-conviction court\u2019s denial of petitioner\u2019s claims for relief. <em>See Soderstrom v. Premo, </em>274 Or App 624, 629, 360 P3d 1272 (2015), <em>rev den, </em>358 Or 550 (2016) (concluding that \u201cthe judgment\u2019s reference to the state\u2019s trial memorandum does not render it compliant with <em>Datt\u201d). </em>We agree and accept defendant\u2019s concession. Consequently, we reverse and remand for the court to enter a new judgment that complies with ORS 138.640(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b928-5\">Reversed and remanded for entry of judgment including the findings required by ORS 138.640(1).</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b928-6\"> Additionally, we reject without written discussion defendant\u2019s contentions raised in his <em>pro se </em>supplemental brief.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
