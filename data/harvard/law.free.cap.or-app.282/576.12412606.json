He contends that the record does not support either award. Defendant raises both challenges for the first time on appeal. We conclude that the rules of preservation do not apply to defendant\u2019s restitution argument, because the record does not show that defendant had notice that the trial court would be considering the restitution request. We also conclude that there is no evidence to support the restitution award. However, defendant\u2019s challenge to the attorney fee award is unpreserved,' and we decline to review his challenge as plain error given the record in this case. Accordingly, we reverse the supplemental judgment but otherwise affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-4\">We describe the pertinent facts in the light most favorable to the state. <em>State v. McClelland, </em>278 Or App 138, 139, 372 P3d 614, <em>rev den, </em>360 Or 423 (2016) (applying that standard in considering challenge to award of restitution). Defendant pled guilty to attempted second-degree assault and fourth-degree assault, both charged as crimes constituting domestic violence, Class C felonies. Following the assault, the victim received treatment for her injuries at the hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-5\">The plea petition agreement that defendant signed specified that he stipulated to \u201catt fees\u201d and to restitution \u201cTBD.\u201d During the plea hearing, the prosecutor advised the court that \u201crestitution for the hospital bill is still being calculated\u201d and \u201cask[ed] that that be left to be determined for 90 days.\u201d The court specifically advised defendant that \u201c[t]he issue of restitution is to be determined. There are minimum fines and attorney\u2019s fees.\u201d Defendant responded, \u201cYes\u201d when asked if he understood those to be part of the terms of the agreement. The court announced that it would order defendant to pay $624 in attorney fees and that it would \u201cleave the restitution issue open 90 days to see if there [could] be an agreement between the parties as to whatever that would be.\u201d The judgment includes a money award of $624 in attorney fees and specifies that restitution will be in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>an amount to be determined within 90 days. That judgment was entered on October 28, 2015.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-4\">On February 10, 2016, the court signed a supplemental judgment, which recites that \u201cthe District Attorney\u2019s Office now requests that the Money Award be amended\u201d to reflect a total of $2,909.05 for victim restitution comprising an ambulance bill in the amount of $731.86 and a hospital bill in the amount of $2,177.19. The supplemental judgment indicates that it was prepared by the Washington County District Attorney and indicates a \u201ccc\u201d before the name of the attorney who represented defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-5\">I. RESTITUTION</p>\n<p id=\"b600-6\">In his first assignment of error, defendant argues that the court erred in ordering restitution when \u201cthere is no record of the district attorney having presented any evidence of the nature and amount of the damages.\u201d The state responds that the argument is not preserved and that we should not reach it as plain error. Defendant agrees that he did not raise this argument in the trial court, but he contends that he had no practical opportunity to object to the restitution award and, thus, that ordinary preservation requirements do not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-7\">A. <em>Preservation Rules</em></p>\n<p id=\"b600-8\">Thus, we begin by considering the state\u2019s argument that this assignment of error is unpreserved, and we reject that argument. Generally, in order for an issue to be preserved for appeal, it must be presented to the trial court. ORAP 5.45(1); <em>Ailes v. Portland Meadows, Inc., </em>312 Or 376, 380, 823 P2d 956 (1991). There is an exception to that general rule, however, when \u201ca party has no practical ability to raise an issue.\u201d <em>Peeples v. Lampert, </em>345 Or 209, 220, 191 P3d 637 (2008). The error that defendant identifies in the supplemental judgment qualifies for an exception to the general rules of preservation.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-9\">The Supreme Court in <em>Peeples </em>described this court\u2019s decision in <em>State v. DeCamp, </em>158 Or App 238, 973 P2d 922 (1999), as an example of when compliance with preservation rules is a \u201cpractical impossibility.\u201d 345 Or at 220 n 7. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>In <em>DeCamp, </em>the trial court issued a post-judgment order that modified the criminal defendant\u2019s sentence without holding a hearing or allowing the defendant to participate in the modification decision. We concluded that preservation requirements did not apply, because \u201c[a] party cannot be required to raise an objection contemporaneously with a trial court\u2019s ruling or other action when the party was not on notice of the trial court\u2019s intended action and had no opportunity to be present when the trial court acted.\u201d 158 Or App at 240.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-4\">The record in this case is materially indistinguishable from the record in <em>DeCamp. </em>The court file contains no indication that defendant was notified that the District Attorney was proposing, or that the court planned to impose, the restitution amounts included in the supplemental judgment. Even if we were to accept the unsigned \u201ccc\u201d on the supplemental judgment as sufficient indication that someone in the Washington District Attorney\u2019s Office sent the document to defendant\u2019s counsel, and to assume that defendant\u2019s counsel received the letter, there is no basis for concluding that defendant\u2019s counsel received the document before the judge signed it. Thus, the record contains no indication that defendant had any practical opportunity to challenge the restitution award included in the supplemental judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-5\">B. <em>Judicial Notice</em></p>\n<p id=\"b601-6\">In an attempt to avoid this deficiency, the state has asked this court to take judicial notice, pursuant to OEC 201(b)(2), of a letter dated January 12, 2015, which the state contends shows that defendant had an opportunity to object to the requested restitution amount.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The letter appears to be on the District Attorney\u2019s office letterhead and is addressed to defendant\u2019s trial counsel. The letter, which is not signed, states, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b601-7\">\u201cThe total amount of restitution requested is $2,909.05. Supporting documentation is attached.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A0K\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>\u201cIf I do not hear from you by Monday. January 19. 2015. I will assume that there is no objection to the restitution amount and will amend the money judgment accordingly.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b602-5\">(Boldface and underscoring in original.)</p>\n<p id=\"b602-6\">Judicial notice applies only to a fact that is \u201cnot subject to reasonable dispute\u201d because the fact is either:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-7\">\u201c(1) Generally known within the territorial jurisdiction of the trial court; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-8\">\u201c(2) Capable of accurate and ready determination by resort to sources whose accuracy cannot reasonably be questioned.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b602-9\">OEC 201(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b602-10\">Regardless of whether the existence of the letter is a matter appropriate for judicial notice, the fact that the state seeks to establish through the letter is not a fact that can be established through judicial notice. The state proposes that the letter shows that defendant had notice that the court would be considering a request to impose restitution in the amount of $2,909.05. To reach that conclusion requires inferences that the letter was sent, that it was received by defendant\u2019s attorney, and that defendant\u2019s attorney never contacted the district attorney\u2019s office to register an objection. None of those inferences is a matter that is \u201cnot subject to reasonable dispute\u201d because the inference is \u201ccapable of accurate and ready determination\u201d from the mere existence of the letter. Thus, the existence of the letter does not change our conclusion that defendant\u2019s challenge to the restitution award is not subject to the ordinary rules of preservation.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-11\">C. <em>Evidence of Restitution</em></p>\n<p id=\"b602-12\">On the merits, the state offers no response to defendant\u2019s challenge to the supplemental judgment. Like sentencing decisions generally, we review the trial court\u2019s restitution award for errors of law, but we are bound by the trial court\u2019s findings if those findings are supported by any evidence in the record. <em>McClelland, </em>278 Or App at 141. We agree with defendant that the court erred in awarding restitution because there is no evidence to support the award.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>Restitution awards are governed by ORS 137.106(1)(a) which provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-4\">\u201cWhen a person is convicted of a crime *** that has resulted in economic damages, the district attorney shall investigate and present to the court, at the time of sentencing or within 90 days after entry of the judgment, evidence of the nature and amount of the damages.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b603-5\">The statute then specifies that \u201c[i]f the court finds from the evidence presented that a victim suffered economic damages,\u201d then the court shall require \u201cthat the defendant pay the victim restitution in a specific amount that equals the full amount of the victim\u2019s economic damages as determined by the court.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b603-6\">\u201cEconomic damages\u201d that can be addressed through an award of restitution include \u201c\u2018reasonable charges necessarily incurred for medical, hospital, nursing and rehabilitative services and other health care services.\u2019\u201d <em>McClelland, </em>278 Or App at 141 (quoting ORS 31.710(2)(a), which ORS 137.106(1)(a) expressly incorporates (emphasis omitted)). However, an award of restitution for medical and hospital services requires proof\u2014through more than just the medical bills\u2014that the charges were reasonable. <em>Id. </em>at 146. The record here contains no medical bills, affidavits or other evidence that the requested restitution amounts were incurred, let alone evidence that the requested amounts were reasonable. Accordingly, the trial court erred in ordering restitution, and we must reverse and remand the supplemental judgment. <em>See State v. Tippetts, </em>239 Or App 429, 432, 244 P3d 891 (2010) (explaining that this court \u201chas consistently remanded for resentencing in circumstances in which the sentencing court erred by imposing restitution in the absence of any evidence of economic damages\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b603-7\">II. ATTORNEY\u2019S FEES</p>\n<p id=\"b603-8\">Defendant also contends that we should address as plain error defendant\u2019s unpreserved challenge to the trial court\u2019s imposition of a court-appointed attorney fee without determining that defendant \u201cis or may be able to pay\u201d the fee. <em>See State v. Wehr, </em>275 Or App 528, 530, 365 P3d 148 (2015), <em>rev den, </em>358 Or 794 (2016) (\u201c[T]he trial court may not impose <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>a sentence requiring payment of court-appointed attorney fees without evidence in the record that the defendant is or may be able to pay such fees.\u201d (Citing ORS 151.505(3); ORS 161.665(4)).). Although the challenge that defendant raises to the fee award is one that we have reached as plain error, <em>see Wehr, </em>275 Or App at 530, we decline to exercise our discretion to review the claim of error in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-4\">We understand defendant\u2019s argument to be a challenge to the court\u2019s ability to impose <em>any </em>court-appointed attorney fees, and we decline to consider that challenge because defendant invited the alleged error when he stipulated to a sentence that includes attorney fees in some amount. <em>See State v. Cook, </em>267 Or App 776, 779, 341 P3d 848 (2014) (\u201cif an appellant \u2018was actively instrumental in bringing about\u2019 the error, then the appellant \u2018cannot be heard to complain, and the case ought not to be reversed because of it\u2019\u201d (quoting <em>State v. Ferguson, </em>201 Or App 261, 269, 119 P3d 794 (2005), <em>rev den, </em>340 Or 34 (2006))). The plea agreement in this case specifies that defendant stipulated to a sentence that included \u201catt[orney] fees\u201d at the plea and sentencing hearing; the court specifically advised the defendant that \u201c[t]here are minimum fines and attorney\u2019s fees\u201d in the plea agreement; and defendant affirmatively represented that he understood those sentencing terms to be part of the agreement. Indeed, defendant does not dispute that he stipulated to the imposition of some amount of attorney fees. Defendant\u2019s stipulation told the court that some amount of fees was authorized without further inquiry, and he \u201ccannot be heard to complain\u201d now that fees were not authorized. <em>See Ferguson, </em>201 Or App at 269.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-5\">Moreover, to the extent that defendant challenges only the amount imposed as an attorney fee, we decline to reach that argument because the record permits competing inferences about whether defendant\u2019s stipulation to pay \u201catt fees\u201d also represented that he has an ability to pay $624 in fees. <em>See Cook, </em>267 Or App at 780 (declining to reach unpreserved challenge to award of $2,460 in attorney fees because the record was susceptible to \u201ccompeting inferences\u201d regarding whether the defendant agreed to the amount). Specifically, when advising the court of the stipulated sentencing terms, the district attorney explained that the state <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>was requesting \u201cattorney\u2019s fees for a Class C Felony.\u201d That comment permits an inference that the fee was based on some predetermined fee schedule and that defendant, by agreeing to pay \u201catt fees\u201d for his Class C felonies, was agreeing that he had the ability to pay $624 in fees. Under the circumstances, we decline to reach defendant\u2019s unpreserved challenge to the absence of evidence that he is or may be able to pay the fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-4\">Supplemental judgment reversed and remanded; otherwise affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b601-9\"> By previous order of the appellate commissioner, the court granted the state\u2019s motion to take judicial notice of the existence of the letter, which allowed it to be included in the appellate record for our review, leaving open our ability to consider the state\u2019s argument that we should take judicial notice that defendant had an opportunity to object to the restitution request.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
