We reject his first assignment of error without discussion. In his second assignment of error, he contends that the trial court erred in imposing, in the judgment, a $60 \u201cMandatory State Amt\u201d on each count. Defendant asserts that the trial court lacked statutory authority to impose those assessments. The state concedes that the trial court lacked authority to impose the $60 assessments and that those portions of the judgment should be reversed. We agree and accept the state\u2019s concession. <em>See State v. Nutt, </em>274 Or App 217, 220-21, 360 P3d 636 (2015), <em>rev den, </em>358 Or 551 (2016) (discussing trial court\u2019s lack of authority to impose $60 \u201cMandatory State Amt\u201d and reversing portion of judgment requiring the defendant to pay that assessment).</p>\n<p id=\"b738-5\">Portions of judgment requiring defendant to pay $60 \u201cMandatory State Amt\u201d reversed; otherwise affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
