On the latter point, we conclude that the trial court\u2019s management of the proceedings was within its allowable discretion and, on the merits, that petitioner made the necessary showing of reasonable apprehension regarding her personal safety. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">Respondent has not requested <em>de novo </em>review, and we find no reason to exercise our discretion to apply such review. ORAP 5.40(8)(c); ORS 19.415(3)(b). Accordingly, we review the trial court\u2019s factual findings for \u201cany evidence\u201d and the court\u2019s legal conclusions for errors of law. <em>King v. W. T. F., </em>276 Or App 533, 537, 369 P3d 1181 (2016). Further, we review the court\u2019s exercise of control over the presentation of evidence and the examination of witnesses for abuse of discretion. <em>See Howell-Hooyman and Hooyman, </em>113 Or App 548, 550, 833 P2d 328 (1992) (reviewing trial court\u2019s decision to end trial before husband completed cross-examination of witness and before presentation of his casein-chief for abuse of discretion).</p>\n<p id=\"b267-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>Respondent, a horse trainer, owns property in Creswell that consists of a house, a recreational vehicle (RV), and a horse arena. At the time of the incidents in question, petitioner and her husband, who own rescue horses, rented the house from respondent, and respondent lived in the RV. They had shared use of the horse arena. Over time, the relationship between the parties became contentious and eventually they obtained temporary SPOs against each other (petitioner against respondent and respondent against petitioner\u2019s husband).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The court held a hearing to determine whether to issue permanent SPOs.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-3\">At the outset of that hearing, the parties, all appearing without counsel, told the trial court that they had three witnesses each.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The court then swore in petitioner, petitioner\u2019s husband, and respondent as witnesses, and stated, \u201cI\u2019m going to give everyone here the opportunity to tell me what it is they understand happened.\u201d The court further stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-4\">\u201cI\u2019ll make an assessment about whether I find it credible or not. If I don\u2019t find it credible, then the testimony will be weighted lightly. If I do find it credible, then it may be weighted heavily and I\u2019ll make a decision based on that testimony.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-5\">\u201cIf during the course of this hearing, I find that it\u2019s not possible for me to determine credibility or lack of credibility based on everyone\u2019s testimony, I will continue the hearing to let you bring in other witnesses.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b267-6\">Having explained its approach, the trial court allowed the parties to testify about their respective versions of events.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-7\">Petitioner testified first and stated that the first unwanted contact with respondent occurred on January 20, 2015, while she was training her horse in the arena. She testified that respondent came up behind her, pushed himself against her, asserted that she needed to \u201crelieve some tension,\u201d and started massaging her shoulders. According to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>petitioner, she left the horse arena \u201cbawling\u201d and later told her husband that she wanted to move out of the house they were renting from respondent.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b268-3\">As to the second incident, petitioner testified that it occurred at around 7:00 p.m. on either April 10 or 11, 2015. Petitioner stated that she was taking a bath at home when she saw respondent peering into her window. According to petitioner, she \u201cscreamed bloody murder\u201d when she realized that respondent was watching her. She testified that, after hearing her scream, her husband \u201cflew out\u201d of the side door of the house and \u201cchased [respondent] halfway down to his trailer.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b268-4\">Once petitioner had presented her version of events, the court called on respondent to testify about why he was seeking an SPO against petitioner\u2019s husband and told him that he could respond to petitioner\u2019s testimony. Respondent began by stating that petitioner\u2019s testimony was a \u201ccomplete fabrication of lies\u201d and that he had proof of his whereabouts on the property \u201con the said dates and times.\u201d He then testified about the incidents that led him to seek an SPO against petitioner and her husband, and the court called the contractor as a witness to testify about alleged contacts that are not at issue in this appeal. The court then redirected respondent\u2019s testimony to the incidents petitioner had testified about, beginning with the bathroom incident. The court asked respondent if there was an incident \u201csome time in the evening, some time in the middle of April or thereabouts\u201d where petitioner\u2019s husband walked out of the house and shouted at him not to come back to their home. Respondent claimed, specifically, that on April 10, between 6:45 p.m. and 8:30 p.m., he was in his RV with his girlfriend and that his girlfriend could corroborate that fact. The court and respondent then had the following colloquy:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>\u201cThe Court: All right. Okay. So are you saying that there was never an incident in the evening on a day sometime in the middle of April in which\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-3\">\u201c[Respondent]: No. None, Your honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-4\">\u201cThe Court: You don\u2019t\u2014all right. In which [petitioner\u2019s husband] is shouting at you not to come back?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-5\">\u201c [Respondent]: Nothing, Your honor.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b269-6\">The court then inquired about the horse arena incident, asking respondent whether he had ever helped petitioner \u201cget on to a horse or ride a horse or anything.\u201d Respondent stated, \u201cNot at all,\u201d and summarized his version of events as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-7\">\u201cI have in <em>two instances </em>and <em>one of them </em>with one of my clients, we were watching as they were finishing up because we were going to go in after them. Because I was training my client with her horse.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-8\">\u201cSo it was a brief standing there outside of the arena watching her and three other\u2014four other people that were working with those horses. So they were doing their thing, we were just watching. I at no point had I ever had any contact with [petitioner] or any horse that she was working with.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b269-9\">(Emphases added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b269-10\">The court then asked petitioner to reply to respondent\u2019s testimony. Petitioner acknowledged that respondent was correct about the particular occasion he had testified about but clarified that the horse arena incident that she had testified about referred to a separate incident that had occurred on a different day. Petitioner then stated that, although respondent had not \u201cphysically harmed\u201d her, he had harmed her \u201cmentally.\u201d She indicated that she had \u201cgotten rid of all [her] horses and moved out of the county to be away from [respondent].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b269-11\">After petitioner and respondent finished testifying, the court asked, \u201cAnything else that anyone wants\u2014was there any other testimony you wanted me to be aware of?\u201d Respondent then alerted the court that his girlfriend and a current client were present in court and indicated that his client would testify about an incident related to petitioner\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>husband. The court found that that incident was not in dispute and then asked respondent, \u201cWere your witnesses going to testify about anything else? Did you have any other witnesses?\u201d Respondent suggested that his girlfriend would testify about another incident related to petitioner\u2019s husband. The court asked again, \u201cAnything else? Any other testimony? Any other evidence you want me to know?\u201d Respondent made an additional statement regarding an incident unrelated to this appeal. Finally, the court asked, \u201cAnything else?\u201d To which respondent answered, \u201cNo, Your honor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b270-4\">At the end of the hearing, the court stated that, because the parties\u2019 testimony was \u201cdiametrically opposed,\u201d it would rely on credibility findings. The court then found petitioner to be more credible and concluded that the two contacts she testified about were more likely than not to be true. Having determined that \u201cthere were at least two unwanted contacts as contemplated under the statute,\u201d the court kept the SPO against respondent in place. In its final order, the court expressly concluded that \u201cit was reasonable for [petitioner to be alarmed or coerced by [respondent\u2019s] contact,\u201d and that it was also \u201cobjectively reasonable for a person in [p] etitioner\u2019s situation to have been alarmed.\u201d It further concluded that \u201c[Respondent\u2019s repeated and unwanted contact caused the [petitioner reasonable apprehension regarding [her] own personal safety.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">We begin with respondent\u2019s second assignment of error, addressing his claim that the SPO hearing was \u201cfundamentally unfair.\u201d A \u201ctrial court, in the exercise of sound discretion, has the authority reasonably to control the presentation of evidence and the examination of witnesses.\u201d <em>Howell-Hooyman, </em>113 Or App at 551 (relying on OEC 611(1)).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>It may be permissible for a court to limit the presentation of evidence or cross-examination of witnesses if it determines that the evidence is or would be \u201cirrelevant or redundant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>However, although \u201ca trial court has some discretion to control cross-examination, *** it does not have the power wholly to deny the right to cross-examine. To deny that right is legal error.\u201d <em>Johnson v. Captain, </em>281 Or App 360, 364, 384 P3d 532 (2016) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b271-4\">Here, respondent contends that the SPO hearing was unfair because the court did not allow him to call his girlfriend and client as witnesses and because the court conducted the hearing \u201cso as to deny parties the right to cross-examine.\u201d He contends that, had his girlfriend and client been allowed to testify, they would have supported his claim that petitioner\u2019s \u201cstory\u201d was a \u201ccomplete fabrication of lies.\u201d In particular, he states that his girlfriend\u2019s testimony would have allowed him to demonstrate that, on April 10, at 7:00 p.m., he was in his RV surfing the internet. As to his client, he contends that her testimony would have allowed him to prove that he \u201cdid nothing more than observe respondent\u201d at the horse arena. Finally, he argues that the court should have allowed him the right to cross-examination because that \u201cfrequently allows a party to show where an adverse witness has exaggerated, given a false impression, or lied.\u201d Petitioner does not appear on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">At the outset, we decline to consider respondent\u2019s challenge regarding cross-examination, because it is unpre-served and petitioner does not request plain error review. <em>See Ailes v. Portland Meadows, Inc., </em>312 Or 376, 380-81, 823 P2d 956 (1991). Respondent did not ask to cross-examine any witnesses, and the court did not expressly deny him that opportunity\u2014that is, it is not clear to us that the court, through its conduct, \u201ccommunicated\u201d such a denial. <em>See Bryant v. Walker, </em>190 Or App 253, 257-59, 78 P3d 148 (2003), <em>rev dismissed, </em>337 Or 585 (2004) (declining to address a respondent\u2019s claim that the court erred by not allowing him to cross-examine the petitioner under similar circumstances). The circumstances in this case are distinguishable from those in <em>Johnson, </em>281 Or App at 367, where we concluded that the court committed plain error by not allowing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>cross-examination. The court in that case \u201cexplicitly told respondent that he was not allowed to ask questions of petitioner \u201d and the \u201cquestions respondent did raise regarding petitioner\u2019s testimony were never posed to petitioner, either directly or through the trial court.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Here, the court did not make such an explicit denial, nor is it apparent from our reading of the record that respondent raised questions about any of the witnesses\u2019 testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-4\">The court likewise did not abuse its discretion by declining to allow respondent\u2019s girlfriend and client to testify. It is evident from the record that the court determined that the probative value of that proposed testimony, if any, was substantially outweighed by considerations of delay and needless presentation of evidence. <em>See </em>OEC 403 (\u201cAlthough relevant, evidence may be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by *** considerations of undue delay or needless presentation of cumulative evidence.\u201d). For instance, petitioner testified, and the court found, that the bathroom incident had occurred either on April 10 or 11; thus, testimony by respondent\u2019s girlfriend about his whereabouts specifically on April 10, in the absence of similar testimony about his whereabouts on April 11, would not have been particularly probative of whether the bathroom incident had, in fact, occurred and, in particular, would not have tended to undercut petitioner\u2019s version of events in any meaningful way. Similarly, the probative value of the client\u2019s testimony was also minimal because the matter that she intended to testify about was not in dispute. Thus, on this record, it was not an abuse of discretion for the court not to call those witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">Having concluded that the trial court did not deprive respondent from a fair hearing, we next address whether the court erred in granting the SPO against respondent. Because respondent challenges the sufficiency of the evidence supporting the SPO, we view \u201cthe evidence and all reasonable inferences that may be drawn from it in the light most favorable to the trial court\u2019s disposition and assesses whether, when so viewed, the record is legally sufficient to permit that outcome.\u201d <em>King, </em>276 Or App at 537 (internal quotation marks omitted). Whether the evidence presented <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>was sufficient is a legal question. <em>Delgado v. Souders, </em>334 Or 122, 134, 46 P3d 729 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b273-3\">We note that, to obtain an SPO under ORS 30.866(1), \u201ca petitioner must prove, by a preponderance of the evidence, that each requirement of that statute has been met.\u201d <em>King, </em>276 Or App at 538. <em>First, </em>a petitioner must \u201cdemonstrate that there were two or more unwanted contacts with either the petitioner or a member of the petitioner\u2019s immediate family within the previous two years.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted). <em>Second, </em>a petitioner must show that she was \u201csubjectively alarmed or coerced by each contact and that the alarm or coercion was objectively reasonable for a person in the victim\u2019s situation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted). In the SPO context, \u201calarm\u201d means \u201cto cause apprehension or fear resulting from the perception of danger.\u201d ORS 163.730(1) (defining \u201calarm\u201d). \u201cDanger\u201d refers to \u201ca threat of physical injury, [and] not merely a threat of annoyance or harassment.\u201d <em>King, </em>276 Or App at 538 (internal quotation marks omitted; brackets in original). <em>Third, </em>\u201cthe contacts, cumulatively, [also] must give rise to subjective apprehension regarding the petitioner\u2019s personal safety or the personal safety of a member of the petitioner\u2019s immediate family or household, and that apprehension must be objectively reasonable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted; brackets in original). \u201cTo determine whether a petitioner\u2019s apprehension is objectively reasonable, we consider all of the circumstances of the parties\u2019 relationship.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted). Further, \u201cconduct that might appear benign when viewed in isolation can take on a different character when viewed either in combination with or against the backdrop of one party\u2019s aggressive behavior toward the other.\u201d <em>Braude v. Braude, </em>250 Or App 122, 130, 279 P3d 290 (2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b273-4\">In challenging the court\u2019s granting of the SPO, respondent contends that \u201cthe court erred in finding that respondent had experienced \u2018reasonable apprehension\u2019 regarding her \u2018personal safety.\u2019\u201d In developing his argument, respondent claims that there was no evidence that petitioner was \u201calarmed\u201d by respondent\u2019s conduct. According to respondent, \u201cthe evidence makes plain that, after the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>unwanted contacts had occurred, [petitioner and her husband] did not phone police, did not flee their home, and were even found laughing when accused of unplugging [respondent\u2019s] power cord.\u201d We understand respondent to argue that the court erred by concluding that petitioner was subjectively and objectively alarmed by the unwanted contacts and that she experienced apprehension for her personal safety. Thus, in considering respondent\u2019s first assignment of error, we address each of those determinations.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-4\">We begin by addressing whether petitioner was subjectively alarmed by the unwanted contacts and whether it was objectively reasonable for a person in petitioner\u2019s situation to experience such alarm.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> As to the first unwanted contact, we conclude that the trial court could determine that petitioner experienced subjective and objective alarm. Respondent engaged in unwanted physical contact with petitioner by pushing up against her from behind and massaging her shoulders. In response, petitioner left the horse arena \u201cbawling\u201d and testified that she wanted to move away from the home she rented from respondent. The court could have reasonably inferred from that evidence that petitioner was subjectively\u2014that is, actually\u2014alarmed. Furthermore, that evidence was also sufficient for the court to conclude that petitioner\u2019s alarm was objectively reasonable, because a person in petitioner\u2019s situation likely would have experienced apprehension of physical injury in the form of a sexual assault, given the physical and sexually suggestive nature of respondent\u2019s unwanted contact. <em>See Delgado, </em>334 Or at 125, 136-37 (plaintiffs alarm was objectively reasonable where the defendant had \u201c\u2018silently and swiftly\u2019 walked up behind her, without announcing\u2014or without her otherwise noticing\u2014his presence!,]\u201d and where the plaintiff was \u201cconcerned by the physically close nature of [the] defendant\u2019s appearances, at times when no other people were nearby\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">As to the second incident, we also conclude that the trial court could determine that petitioner experienced <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>subjective and objective alarm when respondent peered through her bathroom window while she was bathing. The fact that petitioner \u201cscreamed bloody murder\u201d in response to the unwanted contact supports an inference that she experienced apprehension for her safety, especially when considering that the contact occurred when she was undressed and alone in the very private space of her bathroom. The court could have inferred from those circumstances that respondent\u2019s conduct was actually threatening to petitioner, not merely \u201cunsettling, unusual, or unpleasant.\u201d <em>See King, </em>276 Or App at 540 (internal quotation marks omitted). That inference is further supported by the fact that petitioner\u2019s reaction elicited her husband\u2019s intervention and resulted in her husband having to chase respondent away from their home. For those same reasons, the court could also have concluded that petitioner\u2019s alarm was objectively reasonable, because a person in petitioner\u2019s situation would have experienced apprehension for his or her personal safety. <em>See Habrat v. Milligan, </em>208 Or App 229, 239, 145 P3d 180 (2006) (petitioner was objectively alarmed despite the absence of \u201covert threats\u201d where respondent had, among other things, \u201cobsessively directed unwanted attention to petitioner\u201d and where other people had taken steps to protect petitioner).</p>\n<p id=\"b275-3\">We next consider whether those contacts, cumulatively, were sufficient to support the court\u2019s determination that petitioner suffered actual and reasonable apprehension regarding her personal safety. We conclude that they were. Although the record does not contain evidence that respondent had a history of threats or violence, that alone is not dispositive. <em>See Delgado, </em>334 Or at 136-37 (affirming an SPO where the record did not indicate that the respondent had a history of violence). A court may consider all of the evidence in combination, including the relationship between the parties, to determine whether a petitioner suffered actual and reasonable apprehension regarding her personal safety. Here, given that respondent was petitioner\u2019s landlord, respondent\u2019s repeated unwanted contacts with petitioner are particularly troubling, especially in light of their apparent sexual nature. In addition, it appears that respondent was aware that his initial unwanted and physical contact with petitioner had caused her to want to move <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>away, yet he engaged in a further incident of unwanted contact. Respondent\u2019s willingness to continue to engage in such behavior, combined with the physical and sexually suggestive nature of his contacts, supports the court\u2019s conclusion that petitioner\u2019s apprehension for her personal safety was subjectively and objectively reasonable. Thus, the trial court could conclude, based on a preponderance of the evidence, that petitioner experienced \u201creasonable apprehension\u201d regarding her \u201cpersonal safety\u201d as a result of respondent\u2019s contacts.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-3\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b266-6\"> ORS 30.866(1) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-7\">\u201cA person may bring a civil action in a circuit court for a court\u2019s stalking protective order or for damages, or both, against a person if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-8\">\u201c(a) The person intentionally, knowingly or recklessly engages in repeated and unwanted contact with the other person or a member of that persons\u2019 immediate family or household thereby alarming or coercing the other person;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-9\">\u201c(b) It is objectively reasonable for a person in the victim\u2019s situation to have been alarmed or coerced by the contact; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-10\">\u201c(c) The repeated and unwanted contact causes the victim reasonable apprehension regarding the personal safety of the victim or a member of the victim\u2019s immediate family or household.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b266-11\"> We refer to the parties by their designation in the trial court. <em>King v. </em>W. <em>T.
