He asserts that the court committed plain error because the record was silent as to whether he \u201cis or may be able to pay\u201d the costs of his defense. <em>See </em>ORS 151.505(3) (\u201cThe court may not require a person to pay costs under this section unless the person is or may be able to pay the costs.\u201d); ORS 161.665(4) (\u201cThe court may not sentence a defendant to pay costs under this section unless the defendant is or may be able to pay them.\u201d); <em>see also </em>ORAP 5.45(1) (authorizing review of \u201can error of law apparent on the record\u201d). The state concedes that the trial court committed plain error by imposing attorney fees when the record was silent as to defendant\u2019s ability to pay them.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">We accept the state\u2019s concession that the trial court plainly erred in imposing attorney fees of $629 and $416 on this record. <em>See State v. Coverstone, </em>260 Or App 714, 716, 320 P3d 670 (2014) (holding that a trial court commits plain error by imposing court-appointed attorney fees where the record is silent as to the defendant\u2019s ability to pay the fees ordered). Further, we conclude that, for reasons similar to those expressed in <em>State v. Ramirez-Hernandez, </em>264 Or App 346, 349, 332 P3d 338 (2014) (exercising discretion to correct erroneous imposition of $400 in court-appointed attorney fees because the amount was \u201csubstantial\u201d in light of defendant\u2019s circumstances), it is appropriate to exercise our discretion to correct the error.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-6\">Portion of judgments requiring defendant to pay attorney fees reversed; otherwise affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
