He assigns error to the trial court\u2019s denial of his suppression motion in Case No. 14C44145 and its revocation of his probation in Case No. 12C49583 based on the conviction in Case No. 14C44145.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-4\">In Case No. 14C44145, defendant moved to suppress evidence that an Oregon State Police trooper discovered during a traffic stop, which led to the charge of felon in possession of a firearm, ORS 166.270.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> After the trial court denied the motion, defendant entered a conditional plea of guilty to that charge, reserving his right to appeal the trial court\u2019s ruling on the suppression motion. <em>See </em>ORS 135.335(3). In Case No. 12C49583, defendant admitted to violating his probation based on his plea to the felon-in-possession charge in Case No. 14C44145, and the court revoked his probation. The state concedes that the trial court erred in denying defendant\u2019s suppression motion and, consequently, that both judgments must be reversed and remanded. We agree, accept the state\u2019s concession, and reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-5\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b740-6\"> A second charge, for possession of methamphetamine, ORS 475.894, was later dismissed.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
