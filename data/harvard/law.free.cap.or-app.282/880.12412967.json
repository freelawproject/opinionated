We agree that the evidence is legally insufficient to permit a finding that defendant engaged in the kind of physical act of aggression that this court has construed ORS 166.025(l)(a) to require. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-5\">We describe the pertinent facts according to our standard of review, which requires us to draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the state. <em>See State v. Richardson, </em>277 Or App 112, 115, 370 P3d 548 (2016). Defendant lived in the same neighborhood as a seven-year-old girl, T, and her family. He had interacted with T\u2019s father a handful of times when they saw each other in the neighborhood. T knew defendant as \u201cthe mushroom man,\u201d because she knew he lived in a house with a large mushroom in front. The father testified that defendant may have commented that the father had beautiful children. On one occasion, the father had caught defendant trespassing in the family\u2019s backyard looking for cans, and the father told defendant that he was uncomfortable with defendant being on the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-6\">The conviction is based on conduct that occurred on a summer day when T\u2019s father was in the front yard of his home setting up a Slip \u2019N Slide for T, who was waiting in her bathing suit. Defendant walked past and asked the father for a cigarette; the father gave him one and the men made \u201cvery small\u201d talk before the father returned to the Slip \u2019N Slide. A few moments later, the father turned around and saw defendant pick up and hug T. Defendant became distraught and cried as he hugged T, and the father saw defendant say something to her. Defendant then put T down and walked away, still crying. T testified that defendant told her \u201che wanted a girl as pretty as\u201d her. She also testified that defendant picked her up \u201clike [her] mom does sometimes,\u201d which made her feel \u201c[w]eirded out.\u201d When asked to describe his reaction, T\u2019s father testified that \u201cobviously\u201d he was \u201cupset at first, but at the same time <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"882\">*882</page-number>there was a man hugging my daughter who was crying and very distraught.\u201d He \u201cdidn\u2019t want to accelerate any kind of situation with [defendant] at the time,\u201d and \u201csomething told\u201d T\u2019s father to let defendant walk away once defendant set T down.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-4\">The next morning, T\u2019s father found an envelope on his front porch that contained a letter addressed to \u201c[father] &amp; his family\u201d that thanked them for their \u201crespect, hospitality and * * * tolerance\u201d during \u201csome of the most difficult of times.\u201d Included with the letter was a page containing a \u201cpromise,\u201d with a signature line for T and a signature line on which defendant had already signed his name. Above the signature lines, the page set out a promise that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b904-5\">\u201cIF ANY BOY OR OLDER MAN EVER TOUCHES MY PR [.] VATES OR HURTS ME IN ANY BAD WAY, I PROMISE I WILL TELL MY DADDY!\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b904-6\">(Uppercase in original.) A third page instructed, \u201cOkay. Sign and give to your mother. And we won\u2019t worry about this no more,\u201d along with the comment, \u201cyour Daddy is COOL.\u201d The letter made T\u2019s father \u201cso angry that there could have been a physical confrontation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b904-7\">Based on these events, defendant was charged with one count of disorderly conduct under ORS 166.025(l)(a), which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b904-8\">\u201c(1) A person commits the crime of disorderly conduct in the second degree if, with intent to cause public inconvenience, annoyance or alarm, or recklessly creating a risk thereof, the person:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b904-9\">\u201c(a) Engages in fighting or in violent, tumultuous or threatening behavior [.] \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b904-10\">The indictment alleged that defendant violated that statute by engaging in behavior that was \u201cthreatening.\u201d Defendant waived a jury and tried his case to the court. The court found defendant guilty of disorderly conduct as charged after denying defendant\u2019s motion for judgment of acquittal. On appeal, defendant argues that the court was required to grant the motion because he did not engage in the kind of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"883\">*883</page-number>behavior that is required for a conviction under paragraph (l)(a). As indicated above, we agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-4\">Over the past 30 years, our cases applying ORS 166.025(l)(a) have construed that statute in a manner that will not infringe upon constitutionally protected speech. <em>See, e.g., State v. Cantwell, </em>66 Or App 848, 676 P2d 353, <em>rev den, </em>297 Or 124 (1984). In <em>Cantwell, </em>we concluded that the terms \u201cfighting\u201d and \u201cviolent, tumultuous or threatening behavior\u201d in paragraph (a) refer only to \u201cphysical acts of aggression, not speech!.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 852. We also concluded that ORS 166.025(l)(a) makes unlawful only the use of \u201cphysical force\u201d or \u201cphysical conduct which is immediately likely to produce the use of such force,\u201d when the person engages in that behavior with the requisite mental state\u2014 intending to cause or recklessly creating a risk of \u201cpublic inconvenience, annoyance or alarm.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 853. Thus, to prove a violation of ORS 166.025 (l)(a), the state \u201cmust prove that the defendant\u2014with the requisite mental state\u2014 either used \u2018physical force\u2019 or engaged in \u2018physical conduct which is immediately likely to produce the use of physical force.\u201d <em>Richardson, </em>277 Or App at 117 (quoting <em>Cantwell, </em>66 Or App at 853). We observed in <em>State v. Atwood, </em>195 Or App 490, 498, 98 P3d 751 (2004), that the common meaning of \u201cphysical force\u201d \u201cconnotes the actual use of strength or power.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b905-5\">As a further guarantee that the statute does not infringe on protected speech, we have excluded conduct that is \u201cprimarily speech\u201d from our definition of \u201cphysical conduct.\u201d <em>See Richardson, </em>277 Or App at 118. A person\u2019s speech may provide circumstantial context for determining whether or not the person\u2019s conduct was \u201cimmediately likely to result in physical force,\u201d but ORS 166.025(l)(a) does not reach \u201cconduct that is <em>itself </em>speech\u201d or that is \u201cprimarily speech.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 118-19 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b905-6\">Defendant argues that no rational factfinder could infer that his act of picking up and hugging T met the <em>Cantwell </em>test of \u201cphysical force\u201d or \u201cphysical conduct which is immediately likely to produce the use of\u2019 physical force. The state does not suggest that defendant engaged in physical force, but contends that both the act of picking up T <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"884\">*884</page-number>and the act of leaving the letter constitute \u201cphysical conduct immediately likely to produce the use of physical force.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b906-4\">At the outset, we reject the state\u2019s contention that the communicative act of leaving a letter can support defendant\u2019s disorderly conduct conviction. The statute does not reach physical conduct that is \u201cactual but incidental\u201d to a defendant\u2019s speech. <em>Atwood, </em>195 Or App at 498. We have specifically exempted physical acts that are a \u201c\u2018common method of gaining someone\u2019s attention,\u201d\u2019 such as banging on a door and shouting for someone to open it. <em>Richardson, </em>277 Or App at 117-18 (quoting <em>State ex rel Juv. Dept. v. Krieger, </em>177 Or App 156, 161, 33 P3d 351 (2001)); <em>see also Krieger, </em>177 Or App at 160-61 (youth\u2019s physical act of \u201cgrabbing hold of someone\u2019s shoulder\u201d to gain the person\u2019s attention is not disorderly conduct); <em>cf. State v. Miller, </em>226 Or App 314, 318, 203 P3d 319 (2009) (kicking a sign was not \u201cincidental physical conduct\u201d because it was not incidental to speech\u2014the defendant did not \u201ckick the sign as a common method of gaining someone\u2019s attention\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)). When defendant left the letter on T\u2019s porch, he engaged in a common method of gaining someone\u2019s attention, and that communicative act is not proscribed by ORS 166.025(l)(a). Nor can defendant\u2019s after-the-fact letter provide context for evaluating his prior contact with T. <em>See Krieger, </em>177 Or App at 161 (youth\u2019s request that another student help him blow up his school could not give context to his prior, completed act of grabbing the student by the shoulder).</p>\n<p id=\"b906-5\">We also conclude that defendant\u2019s act of picking up and holding T cannot support his conviction for disorderly conduct. Although that behavior involved physical conduct that was more than incidental to any statements that defendant made to T, there is no evidence to permit an inference that defendant was engaging in the kind of behavior that ORS 166.025(l)(a) reaches. As we have emphasized, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"885\">*885</page-number>concluded in <em>Cantwell </em>that the terms \u201cfighting,\u201d \u201cviolent,\u201d \u201ctumultuous,\u201d and \u201cthreatening\u201d in paragraph (a) \u201cdescribe physical acts of aggression\u201d: conduct that is either physical force or \u201cimmediately likely\u201d to produce physical force. 66 Or App at 852.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-4\">Our cases affirming convictions for disorderly conduct under ORS 166.025(l)(a) illustrate the kind of conduct that the statute will reach. In <em>State ex rel Juv. Dept. v. Saechao, </em>167 Or App 227, 234, 236-37,2 P3d 935, <em>rev den, </em>331 Or 283 (2000), this court concluded that the youth engaged in \u201ctumultuous\u201d behavior for purposes of ORS 166.025(l)(a) when he joined a group of boys to threaten and surround a victim, preventing the victim\u2019s escape while another boy attacked him. Similarly, in <em>State v. Davies, </em>195 Or App 534, 536-37, 98 P3d 757 (2004), we affirmed a conviction under ORS 166.025(l)(a) based on evidence that the defendant \u201caggressively\u201d and physically confronted store employees who had asked him to leave, after which \u201c[a] fracas ensued, resulting in various injuries to several employees.\u201d The defendant\u2019s conduct included poking or hitting a store employee in the chest and striking out at the employee. <em>Id. </em>at 537. Finally, in <em>Miller, </em>226 Or App at 316-18, we concluded that the defendant engaged in \u201cphysical acts of aggression\u201d when he kicked a three-foot-tall, metal sign hard enough to send it off of the sidewalk and into the middle of a four-lane road, because \u201che was frustrated that it was blocking the sidewalk.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b907-5\">Moreover, in assessing whether a person\u2019s physical conduct rises to the level of \u201cimmediately likely\u201d to produce physical force, the conduct must be \u201cviewed in totality of the circumstances.\u201d <em>Atwood, </em>195 Or App at 498. For example, in <em>Atwood, </em>although the defendant engaged in an angry confrontation with the principal of his daughter\u2019s school, including gesturing angrily and yelling an obscene threat against a third party \u201cat the top of his lungs,\u201d we held that the evidence was legally insufficient to support the defendant\u2019s conviction for \u201ctumultuous or threatening\u201d disorderly conduct when viewed in the context of the totality of the circumstances. <em>Id. </em>at 493-94. Those circumstances included statements that made it clear that the defendant\u2019s anger was directed at a person who was behind a closed door. <em>Id. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"886\">*886</page-number>at 499. The court also considered how the defendant\u2019s conduct was perceived by the school principal, who \u201cwas not concerned for his own safety\u2014notwithstanding [the] defendant\u2019s physical conduct and angry demeanor\u201d and who \u201cby extension, would not have responded to that conduct with physical force.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 499-500. In the context of those circumstances, the court concluded that the evidence was \u201cinsufficient to support a finding that [the] defendant had engaged in physical conduct that was \u2018immediately likely to produce the use of [physical] force\u2019\u201d either by the defendant, or by an \u201cobjectively reasonable person in [the principal\u2019s] position.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b908-4\">Based on the guidance supplied by our prior case law, we conclude that the evidence was legally insufficient to permit the trier of fact to infer that defendant engaged in behavior that was a threatening physical act of aggression. Although defendant\u2019s act of picking up and hugging a young girl who barely knew him may have transgressed ordinary social boundaries,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> neither T nor her father described defendant\u2019s behavior in terms from which a factfinder could infer that defendant\u2019s behavior was an act of aggression when viewed in the totality of the circumstances. Defendant was not a total stranger, he had just finished a brief, sociable interaction with T\u2019s father, and he was distraught and crying during the encounter with T.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-5\">Moreover, there is no evidence that either T or her father perceived defendant as threatening aggression against T. T felt \u201cfw]eirded out\u201d to be held in the way her mother holds her, and T\u2019s father was \u201cupset\u201d but not motivated to confront defendant, given defendant\u2019s distraught demeanor. Although their reactions are \u201cnot necessarily dis-positive of how an objectively reasonable person\u201d would have reacted to defendant, their testimony indicates that defendant\u2019s conduct did not appear outwardly threatening, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"887\">*887</page-number>we perceive no reason \u201cwhy an objectively reasonable person in [that] position would have been likely to respond differently.\u201d <em>See Atwood, </em>195 Or App at 500. In short, the evidence was legally insufficient to permit the trier of fact to infer that defendant\u2019s conduct, when viewed in the totality of the circumstances, was \u201cimmediately likely to produce\u201d physical force, either by defendant or by T or her father. Defendant was entitled to a judgment of acquittal.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-4\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b906-6\"> We observed in <em>Atwood </em>that <em>Cantwell\u2019s </em>formulation left unanswered whether the defendant\u2019s conduct must be immediately likely to produce the use of force by the defendant or by a person witnessing the defendant\u2019s conduct. 195 Or App at 498. We left that question unresolved because we concluded that the evidence was insufficient to permit a trier of fact to infer that the defendant\u2019s conduct was immediately likely to produce the use of physical force by either the defendant or by those exposed to the conduct. <em>Id. </em>For the same reasons, we need not resolve that question in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b908-6\"> The state did not allege that defendant\u2019s contact with T constituted the crime of harassment, which reaches \u201coffensive physical contact\u201d if done with the intent to harass, ORS 166.065(l)(a), or that defendant hugged T in an attempt to commit the crime of sexual abuse in the third degree, which prohibits contact with a minor\u2019s \u201cintimate parts * \u215c * for the purpose of arousing or gratifying the sexual desire.\u201d ORS 163.305(6) (defining sexual contact); ORS 163.415 (prohibiting sexual contact).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
