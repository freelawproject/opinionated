J.</author>\n<p id=\"b715-4\">Defendant appeals a judgment of conviction, entered after a trial to the court, of 20 theft-related offenses. He contends, in part, that (1) the trial court erred in requiring him to wear a restraint on one of his hands during trial; and (2) under <em>State v. Mills, </em>354 Or 350, 312 P3d 515 (2013), his convictions on certain counts must be reversed and remanded so as to afford him an opportunity to dispute venue, including by way of controverting the state\u2019s evidence, if he so elects.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> As explained below, we conclude that the trial court erroneously maintained the hand restraint without requisite justification on this record, but, in the totality of the circumstances, that error was harmless. <em>See, e.g., State v. Bates, </em>203 Or App 245, 250-54, 125 P3d 42 (2005), <em>rev den, </em>340 Or 483 (2006). We also conclude that a <em>Mills-based </em>reversal and remand is inapposite in the idiosyncratic procedural posture of this case, in which venue was comprehensively litigated at trial. <em>See State v. Anderson, </em>264 Or App 183, 185, 331 P3d 1052 <em>adh'd to as modified on recons, </em>265 Or App 222, 333 P3d 1250, <em>rev den, </em>356 Or 575 (2014). Accordingly, we affirm.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b715-5\">The facts pertaining to defendant\u2019s criminal conduct were, and are\u2014to the extent they bear on our consideration\u2014undisputed. The victim was an 83-year-old widow, and defendant was her daughter\u2019s romantic companion. The three of them shared a home. Over a five-month period\u2014 between January 2012, when the victim underwent hip surgery and subsequently was frequently in great pain and significantly medicated, and the beginning of June\u2014 defendant, after misappropriating the victim\u2019s debit card, made unauthorized purchases and withdrawals of substantial sums on dozens of occasions, twice fraudulently induced the victim to write checks to his business for amounts exceeding $50,000 (a total of nearly $133,000), misappropriated a credit card, and stole the victim\u2019s jewelry. Consequently, defendant was charged by indictment with nine counts of aggravated first-degree theft (Counts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>1-5, 7-10), ORS 164.057;<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> seven counts of aggravated identity theft (Counts 11-17), ORS 165.803;<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> three counts of identity theft (Counts 18-20), ORS 165.800;<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and one count of first-degree theft (Count 6), ORS 164.055.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b716-3\">Defendant waived a jury trial. On the morning of trial, defendant appeared in leg and hand restraints. Defense counsel requested that the hand restraints be removed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-4\">\u201cThis is going to be a multi-day trial with a significant amount of financial records and significant number of witnesses. I\u2019ll need to be able to communicate with my client effectively, and so I\u2019m asking the Court to order [that] * * * <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>the handcuffs on my client be removed during the course of the trial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b717-4\">\u00ab\u2021\u215c\u215c\u215c\u215c</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b717-5\">\u201cHe\u2019ll still have leg restraints, but\u2014so he can write and we can * * * adequately communicate * * \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b717-6\">The court deferred ruling, noting that it \u201cleave [s] those decisions up to the sheriffs department,\u201d and directed the courtroom deputy to check with the deputy\u2019s superior.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The deputy sought clarification from defense counsel: \u201c[J]ust so I\u2019m clear, both hand restraints off or just the right hand, so he can write?\u201d Counsel responded: \u201cBoth hand restraints. The leg restraints would remain on for the trial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b717-7\">Shortly thereafter, the deputy returned, and the court stated: \u201cSo after consultation with the sheriffs department, the defendant\u2019s going to have his writing hand released, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re going to do.\u201d Defense counsel remonstrated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b717-8\">\u201cMy client is currently incarcerated at the work center. It\u2019s a lower level of security. He\u2014my understanding, and I\u2019m sure the State would correct me if I\u2019m wrong\u2014has no escape convictions, no crimes of violence going on. He is in his late 50s, and he\u2019s currently charged simply with property crimes. *** [T]he risk endangering the safety of anyone in the courtroom or the courthouse is nonexistent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b717-10\">\u201cIn addition, there\u2019s a vast amount of business records, and his ability to quickly page through those will be compromised. My ability to communicate with him again will be compromised.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b717-11\">The court then asked, \u201cHow is your ability to communicate with your client compromised?\u201d Defense counsel responded, \u201cHis ability to write * * * notes to me, as well as go through the paperwork.\u201d The court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b717-12\">\u201cWell, I\u2019m observing your client right now and [it] looks [like] he\u2019s right-handed. He has a pen in his hand. He\u2019s moving his hand very freely, and he\u2019s resting his left hand on the desk kind of in a normal manner. I don\u2019t see any great difficulty at all here.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"pAtg\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>[[Image here]]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b718-2\">\u201cMy position is actually pretty simple. I <em>make\u2014I allow the sheriff </em>s <em>department, who\u2019s responsible for the security of the courtroom and courthouse and responsible for the defendant while he\u2019s in custody, I allow them to make those decisions. </em>And there\u2019s no jury present in this case, obviously, so the fact that he\u2019s visibly in restraints is of no concern. He\u2019s wearing street clothes, in any event.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b718-3\"><em>\u201cAnd if there becomes an issue you want to bring up later, *** he\u2019s having some difficulty handling documents, you can bring it up later and maybe I\u2019ll address the issue for that purpose. </em>But the sheriff\u2019s department has directed that his\u2014only his writing hand be released, and it\u2019s been released.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b718-4\">(Emphases added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b718-5\">The state then presented testimony substantiating the facts recounted above. During cross-examination, defense counsel elicited testimony pertaining to the location of some of the myriad aggregated transactions on which the aggravated first-degree theft and aggravated identity theft counts were predicated.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-6\">Defendant also testified\u2014at length. On both direct examination and cross-examination, he admitted, without reservation or qualification, having engaged in all of the charged conduct, though he disputed whether the victim was a \u201cvulnerable victim\u201d as charged for sentencing enhancement purposes. Defendant explained that he had engaged in much of the criminal conduct in an effort to sustain his faltering property-development business and claimed that he intended to repay the victim when the business\u2019s cash flow improved.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> During his direct examination, defense counsel elicited extended testimony from defendant relating to whether certain purchases and ATM withdrawals using the victim\u2019s debit card had occurred in Deschutes County or elsewhere, including locations in Multnomah and Marion Counties and Colorado, where defendant would travel for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>business. The prosecutor, on cross-examination, also elicited testimony pertaining to venue.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-4\">At the beginning of his closing argument, defense counsel tendered to the court a submission entitled \u201cMemorandum in Support of Not Guilty Verdicts,\u201d with an attachment denominated \u201cMcCright Defense Ledger.\u201d The memorandum focused on legal issues pertaining to merger of various counts, lack of venue based on the purported location of certain predicate transactions, and alleged failure of proof either as to sufficient aggregation or aggravating sentencing factors for certain counts. The attached \u201cDefense Ledger\u201d purported to list each predicate transaction for each count, including those counts of aggravated first-degree theft and aggravated identity theft based on multiple transactions, identifying, <em>inter alia, </em>the date, \u201c [1] ocation,\u201d character, and amount of each transaction. The \u201c[1] ocation\u201d column of the \u201cledger,\u201d while representing that some of the predicate transactions occurred outside of Deschutes County, also represented that at least one\u2014and, in most instances, the overwhelming majority\u2014of the predicate transactions for each of the aggravated first-degree theft and aggravated identity theft counts (Counts 1-5 and 11-17, respectively) had occurred in \u201c[B]end.\u201d The \u201cledger\u201d included similar representations as to all other counts, including Count 6 (first-degree theft) and Count 18 (identity theft).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b719-5\">Defense counsel\u2019s arguments in closing substantially tracked the memorandum. There was no argument disputing whether defendant had actually engaged in the charged conduct. Rather, the focus was on merger, the legal sufficiency of the proof of aggravating factors, and\u2014as pertinent to our consideration\u2014venue. Specifically, defense counsel asserted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b719-6\">\u201cFor those transactions that didn\u2019t occur in Deschutes County, [including] either Marion County or Multnomah County, * * * the venue is not appropriate here today, and for those that occurred in Colorado, the Court does not have jurisdiction over those or venue is not proper in this case.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b720-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>The ostensible premise of defendant\u2019s position was that, if even one of the multiple predicate transactions underlying each aggregated count had occurred outside of Deschutes County (or, more precisely, if the state failed to prove that <em>all </em>of the predicate aggregated transactions had occurred in Deschutes County), that count must be dismissed for failure of legally sufficient proof of venue.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-4\">The state anticipated that contention. In closing argument, the prosecutor asserted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b720-5\">\u201cThe argument may be made that because some of the transactions occurred outside of the state or in other counties of this state, uses of the debit card to withdraw [the victim\u2019s] money and steal from her, that venue isn\u2019t proven with regard to the particular counts because we don\u2019t\u2014 we can\u2019t say that * * * all of these events occurred in this county, * * * so that the value, the venue value would drop below $10,000. That is not the law, however.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b720-6\">\u201cThe law is that venue is appropriate where either the conduct occurs or where the result occurs, and the result in this case was in Deschutes County. The result was [the victim\u2019s bank] account that was established in Bend, in Deschutes County, Oregon, suffered these losses.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b720-7\">In so arguing, the prosecutor invoked ORS 131.305(1) and ORS 131.315.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The prosecutor and the court referred, in colloquy, to ORS 131.315(1) and (7). However, neither referred <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>to ORS 131.315(12), which relates specifically to venue with respect to trial of theft and identity theft charges predicated on multiple transactions occurring in different counties. Under that provision, venue for the trial of such charges lies \u201cin any county in which one of the acts of theft * * * or identity theft was committed.\u201d <em>Id.; accord State v. Berndt, 282 </em>Or App 73, 83, 386 P3d 196 (2016) (holding that, by contrast to ORS 131.315(12), \u201c\u2018theft,\u2019 as used in ORS 131.315(7), does not include \u2018identity theft\u2019\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b721-4\">The trial court found defendant guilty on all counts, and this appeal ensued.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-5\">We first address defendant\u2019s appellate challenge to the trial court\u2019s ruling maintaining a restraint on defendant\u2019s left (nonwriting) hand. As set out above, trial counsel did not object to the maintenance of leg restraints, <em>see </em>282 Or App at 695; consequently, defendant\u2019s assignment of error relates solely to the hand restraint. Defendant contends that the record was legally insufficient to substantiate security concerns justifying that restraint and that, in all events, the trial court failed to exercise independent discretion in that matter, impermissibly acceding to the judgment of the sheriffs office. <em>See, e.g., State v. Wall, </em>252 Or App 435, 439, 287 P3d 1250 (2012), <em>rev den, </em>353 Or 280 (2013) (\u201cAlthough a sheriffs deputy *** may provide helpful and necessary information in order to assist in the assessment of the risk posed by an unrestrained defendant, the trial court may not simply accept the conclusion of others; it must make an independent determination that restraint is justified.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b721-6\">The state does not defend the merits of the court\u2019s ruling. Instead, the state contends that, in the totality of the circumstances, any error was harmless. In that regard, the state emphasizes that the trial court, in response to counsel\u2019s initial objections, ordered that the restraint on defendant\u2019s right (writing) hand be removed and invited counsel to inform the court if, during the trial, the remaining hand restraint impaired defendant\u2019s ability to communicate with counsel\u2014and that counsel never did so.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-7\">We agree with defendant that the trial court erred, because the record does not substantiate the requisite justification for the hand restraint. Indeed, in that respect, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>the circumstances of this case approximated those in <em>Wall. </em>Here, as there, the state failed to \u201cadduce evidence that would permit the court to find that the defendant poses an immediate or serious risk of committing dangerous or disruptive behavior, or that he or she poses a serious risk of escape.\u201d 252 Or App at 442-43.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-4\">We further conclude, however, that, in the totality of the circumstances, that error was harmless. Our conclusion in that regard derives from our determination that the record here contradicts any material impairment of the interests identified in our precedents addressing the imposition of physical restraints. In <em>Wall, </em>we summarized those considerations:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b722-5\">\u201c[T]here are three foundations for common-law and constitutional safeguards against the unfettered imposition of restraints on criminal accuseds: \u2018(1) impingement on the presumption of innocence and the dignity of judicial proceedings; (2) inhibition of the accused\u2019s decision whether to take the stand as a witness; and (3) inhibition of the accused\u2019s consultation with his or her attorney.\u2019\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b722-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 442 (quoting <em>State ex rel Juv. Dept. v. Millican, </em>138 Or App 142, 147-48, 906 P2d 857 (1995), <em>rev den, </em>323 Or 114 (1996)); <em>see also State v. Washington, </em>355 Or 612, 627-30, 330 P3d 596, <em>cert </em>den, _ US _, 135 S Ct 685 (2014) (summarizing the same concerns and concluding that the record substantiated trial court\u2019s order that the defendant wear a stun belt that was not visible during jury trial); <em>Bates, </em>203 Or App at 250-54 (addressing those concerns in jury trial in which the defendant was required to wear a stun belt not visible to jurors and concluding that any error in imposing that restraint was harmless).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b722-8\">In this case, it is unclear from the record whether the single hand restraint was visible during trial; although the trial court observed that defendant was \u201cvisibly in restraints,\u201d 282 Or App at 696, that comment could have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>related to the leg restraints, the hand restraint, or both. In all events, the court, which, in this bench trial, was the trier of fact, was obviously aware of the hand restraint\u2014as it was of the leg restraints to which defense counsel lodged no objection. Thus, at least to some extent, the first consideration, pertaining to \u201cimpingement on the presumption of innocence and the dignity of judicial proceedings,\u201d <em>Bates, </em>203 Or App at 251 (internal quotation marks omitted), is implicated. <em>Compare Millican, </em>138 Or App at 146-48 (addressing that consideration in juvenile delinquency proceeding in which court was trier of fact) <em>with State v. E. J. Y, </em>113 Wash App 940, 952, 55 P3d 673, 679 (2002) (holding that where juvenile was held in restraints throughout \u201cfact finding hearing\u201d without findings justifying restraint, the error was harmless because \u201c[tjhis was a proceeding without a jury, which greatly reduces the likelihood of prejudice!,]\u201d and there was no showing that \u201cthe use of restraints substantially affected the trial court\u2019s fact finding\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b723-3\">Nevertheless, when, as here, there were no material factual disputes as to whether defendant had committed the culpable acts\u2014as noted above, defendant freely admitted his culpability\u2014the potential for impermissible subconscious skewing of the trial court\u2019s essential factual determinations, \u201cimping [ing] on the presumption of innocence,\u201d was nonexistent.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> <em>Accord People v. </em>Williams, _ Ill App 3d _, _, 53 NE3d 1019, 1027 (2016) (erroneous shackling in bench trial held not harmless where the defendant was charged with sexual abuse and the trial was, essentially, a \u201ccredibility contest\u201d). Consequently, there was no cognizable impairment of the first interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-7\">With respect to the second fundamental consideration, the record belies any \u201cinhibition of [defendant\u2019s] decision whether to take the stand as a witness.\u201d <em>Wall, 252 Or </em>App at 442 (internal quotation marks omitted). Defendant did, in fact, testify\u2014and did so at length\u2014and \u201cthe written record of defendant\u2019s testimony is not marked by any obvious <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>sign of anxiety.\u201d <em>Bates, </em>203 Or App at 253. <em>See id. </em>at 252-53 (concluding that error was harmless where, <em>inter alia, </em>the defendant testified and \u201cnever asserted that the [stun] belt affected his testimony [,] \u201d and noting that, because \u201cthis case does not reduce to a true swearing match [,] * * there is little likelihood that the presence of the stun belt had sufficient effect on defendant\u2019s ability to testify so as to affect the verdict\u201d); <em>Millican, </em>138 Or App at 148 (noting, in concluding that error in unjustified imposition of leg restraints was harmless, that \u201c[c]hild did, in fact, testify, and presented his version of events without any suggestion of discomfort or reluctance\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b724-3\">Finally with respect to the single hand restraint, the record also contradicts any material impairment of defendant\u2019s ability to consult with counsel and participate in his own defense. The trial court, as noted, explicitly found that defendant was able to write \u201cvery freely\u201d with his unrestrained right hand, <em>see </em>282 Or App at 695, and, notwithstanding the court\u2019s invitation to do so, defense counsel never informed the court during the trial of any \u201cdifficulty handling documents\u201d or related issues. <em>Id.; see Bates, </em>203 Or App at 253 (\u201c[T]here is nothing in the record that indicates that the stun belt had any effect on defendant\u2019s ability to communicate with his counsel.\u201d); <em>Millican, </em>138 Or App at 148 (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b724-4\">The trial court\u2019s error in maintaining the single hand restraint was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-5\">We turn, finally, to venue. Defendant contends that, because his trial antedated <em>Mills </em>and he had moved for judgments of acquittal based on alleged insufficiency of proof of venue as to certain counts (Counts 1-6, 11-16, and 18), he is entitled under <em>Mills </em>to a reversal and remand of the convictions on those counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-6\">The state counters that, consistently with <em>Anderson, </em>264 Or App at 185, a Mills-based reversal and remand is inapposite where, as here, the parties have comprehensively litigated venue, with defendant contesting the state\u2019s evidence and presenting evidence of his own, at trial. We agree with the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number><em>Anderson </em>guides our consideration. There, the defendant, who, in a <em>pre-Mills </em>trial, had been convicted of several drug offenses, assigned error to the trial court\u2019s denial of her \u201cvenue-based motion for a judgment of acquittal.\u201d 264 Or App at 184. Invoking <em>Mills, </em>the defendant argued that she was \u201centitled to a remand for an evidentiary hearing.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In rejecting that contention, we began with a summary of <em>Mills:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b725-4\">\u201cIn <em>Mills, </em>the Supreme Court held that venue is not a material element of an offense that the state must prove beyond a reasonable doubt and that, when the issue of venue is not raised before trial, it is deemed waived. Although the <em>Mills </em>defendant had not challenged venue before trial, the court reversed the defendant\u2019s convictions and remanded to the trial court so that the defendant would have an opportunity to challenge venue. It did so because it concluded that \u2018it would be unfair to [the] defendant to hold that he [had] <em>forfeited the opportunity to challenge venue, </em>in light of the fact that the law in effect at the time of trial permitted him to wait until the state rested to raise the issue.\u2019\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b725-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 184-85 (quoting <em>Mills, </em>354 Or at 373; emphasis added <em>in Anderson) </em>citations omitted). We then concluded that the remedial/dispositional concerns that informed the reversal and remand in <em>Mills </em>did not apply to the defendant in <em>Anderson'.</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b725-6\">\u201cLike the defendant in <em>Mills, </em>defendant waited until trial to challenge venue. However, unlike the defendant in <em>Mills, </em>who simply moved for a judgment of acquittal based on the state\u2019s failure to introduce evidence on venue, defendant affirmatively contested venue at trial. <em>Accordingly, the unfairness that necessitated the remand in Mills\u2014viz., to avoid a forfeiture of the defendant\u2019s opportunity to challenge venue\u2014is not present in this case. </em>Here, the state presented evidence on venue at trial, and defendant contested that evidence and put on venue evidence of her own. Accordingly, we do not believe that remand on the issue of venue is appropriate in this case.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b725-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 185 (emphasis added).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b726-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>The same is true here\u2014with an additional, exacerbating twist: Defendant not only fully litigated venue by way of cross-examination of the state\u2019s witnesses, his own testimony, and closing argument, but he also made admissions during his testimony substantiating venue under ORS 131.015(12) as to some of the counts for which he now seeks reversal and remand, and\u2014through representations in the \u201cdefense ledger\u201d submitted for the court\u2019s consideration\u2014 acknowledged facts legally sufficient to establish venue under ORS 131.015(12) as to all such counts. <em>See </em>282 Or App at 697-98.
