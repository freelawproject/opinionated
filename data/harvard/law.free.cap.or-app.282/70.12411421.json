The trial court further found that appellant met the criteria for commitment as a person with a \u201cchronic mental illness.\u201d <em>See </em>ORS 426.005(l)(f)(C); ORS 426.495. On appeal, appellant argues, among other contentions, that the record does not contain legally sufficient evidence to support the involuntary commitment on any of the grounds stated by the trial court. The state concedes that the record is legally insufficient to support the involuntary commitment and that the judgment should be reversed. We agree and accept the state\u2019s concession.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-5\">Reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
