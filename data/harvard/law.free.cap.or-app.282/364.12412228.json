The driver had pulled over to the side of the road in a rural area, where there were a few houses. There was no evidence that anyone would have been aware of defendant\u2019s conduct other than defendant, the driver, and later the law enforcement officers who responded.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-6\">ORS 166.025 prohibits certain conduct if done \u201cwith intent to cause public inconvenience, annoyance or alarm, or recklessly creating a risk thereof.\u201d In <em>State v. Love, </em>271 Or App 545, 553-55, 351 P3d 780 (2015), we interpreted the word \u201cpublic\u201d in that statute and concluded that it referred to \u201cthe community in general,\u201d and \u201cnot just specific individuals.\u201d Thus, when the offense is charged with a reckless mental state, as here, the state is \u201crequired to adduce evidence that defendant consciously disregarded an unjustifiable risk that his behavior would affect not just specific individuals, but the public in general.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 554. Citing <em>Love, </em>defendant argues that the state failed to present legally sufficient evidence of a risk of <em>public </em>inconvenience, annoyance, or alarm. The state concedes that the trial court erred in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>denying defendant\u2019s motion for judgment of acquittal on that ground. We agree, accept the state\u2019s concession, and reverse defendant\u2019s disorderly conduct conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-3\">Conviction for disorderly conduct reversed; otherwise affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b387-7\"> As relevant here, ORS 166.025 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-8\">\u201c(1) A person commits the crime of disorderly conduct in the second degree if, with intent to cause public inconvenience, annoyance or alarm, or recklessly creating a risk thereof, the person:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-9\">\u201c(a) Engages in fighting or in violent, tumultuous or threatening behavior!.] \u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b387-10\"> Defendant also assigns error to the trial court\u2019s ruling on his objection to the state\u2019s closing argument relating to the disorderly conduct charge. In light of our disposition of his first assignment of error, we need not address the second.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
