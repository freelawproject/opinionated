For that conduct, she was convicted of two misdemeanors: driving under the influence of intoxicants (DUII), ORS 813.010 (Count 1); and reckless driving, ORS 811.140 (Count 2). At trial, defendant testified that she had not been intoxicated on the night in question but, instead, testified that she had consumed three O\u2019Doul\u2019s, a nonalcoholic beer, that night. On appeal, she assigns error to the trial court\u2019s decision to permit the prosecutor to ask her why she had not told the investigating officer, Kritter, about her consumption of the O\u2019Doul\u2019s, contending that the question represented an improper comment on defendant\u2019s invocation of her right against self-incrimination, thereby violating her rights under Article I, section 12, of the Oregon Constitution,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Defendant also assigns error to the trial court\u2019s decision to permit the prosecutor to argue, over defendant\u2019s objection, that defendant\u2019s story about consuming nonalcoholic beer was false because defendant did not tell Kritter the same story on the night of the incident. Defendant contends that that argument impermissibly permitted the state to impeach her with her constitutionally protected right to remain silent. On review for legal error, <em>State v. Reineke, </em>266 Or App 299, 307, 337 P3d 941 (2014), we agree with defendant. Accordingly, we reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">The facts pertinent to the issues on appeal are not disputed. Responding to an 11:52 p.m. report of a vehicle stuck on the MAX tracks, Kritter found defendant in the driver\u2019s seat of her car, revving her engine and spinning her wheels in an attempt to get unstuck. Concerned about the risk of getting hit by a train, Kritter asked defendant to turn off the car and get out of it. When defendant did so, Kritter observed signs that indicated defendant was under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>the influence of alcohol, including an odor of alcohol. As they walked to his patrol car, Kritter questioned defendant about how she had ended up on the MAX tracks. During the course of that conversation, defendant admitted that she did not feel safe to drive, but declined to answer any questions about what and how much she had had to drink that night:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-4\">\u201c [Kritter:] How much have you had to drink tonight [?]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-5\">\u201c[Defendant:] Tonight?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-6\">\u201c[Kritter:] Yeah.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-7\">\u201c[Defendant:] (No audible response).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-8\">\u201c [Kritter:] You\u2019re just shaking your head. What\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-9\">\u201c[Defendant:] I am not going to answer anything.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-10\">\u201c[Kritter:] Okay. Do you feel safe to operate a motor vehicle?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-11\">\u201c[Defendant:] No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-12\">\u201c[Kritter:] No? How come you got into your car and were driving then?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-13\">\u201c[Defendant:] That\u2019s why I\u2019m trying to get myself out of this situation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b396-14\">Persuaded that defendant had been driving under the influence of intoxicants, Kritter arrested her, advised her of her <em>Miranda </em>rights, and transported defendant to the police station. After Kritter provided defendant with <em>Miranda </em>warnings, she continued to respond to Kritter\u2019s questions. When Kritter asked defendant whether she would provide a breath sample, defendant responded that she would neither provide a breath sample nor perform a \u201croadside sobriety\u201d test. Kritter then asked defendant whether she \u201ccould have navigated the MAX tracks a little bit better\u201d if she had not had so much to drink. Defendant responded, \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d At one point, defendant mentioned that she is \u201ca Jack and Coke person.\u201d Kritter later asked defendant, \u201c[I]f you were to provide a breath sample today, it would be over the 0.08 level?\u201d Defendant responded, \u201cNo comment.\u201d Finally, when Kritter asked defendant why she had been driving drunk, defendant responded that she \u201c[w] anted to go home.\u201d Kritter recorded almost the entirety of his interaction with defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>As a result of the incident, defendant was charged with DUII and reckless driving. Before trial, defendant moved to suppress the statements that defendant made after she told Kritter that she was \u201cnot going to answer anything.\u201d Defendant contended that she had invoked her constitutional right against self-incrimination and that, as a result, any subsequent statements elicited by Kritter had to be suppressed. The trial court granted the motion in part. Although the court determined that defendant was neither in custody nor compelling circumstances, the court concluded that defendant had equivocally invoked her right against self-incrimination. The court further reasoned that, because Kritter did not clarify that equivocal invocation, defendant\u2019s answers to Kritter\u2019s questions, from the point at which defendant said she was \u201cnot going to answer anything\u201d until the point in time that defendant received the <em>Miranda </em>warnings, had to be suppressed.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The court ruled that defendant\u2019s post <em>-Miranda </em>statements were admissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-4\">The state presented its case-in-chief in a manner consistent with the trial court\u2019s ruling. Kritter testified, among other things, that defendant had smelled like alcohol on the night of the incident. Defendant then testified in her own defense. In response to Kritter\u2019s testimony about the smell of alcohol, she explained that she smelled like alcohol on the night of the incident because she had consumed three nonalcoholic beers at the bar where she had been. Defendant also testified that she felt safe to drive that night. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>On cross-examination, as a result of defendant\u2019s testimony about feeling safe to drive, the trial court permitted the state to impeach defendant with her previously suppressed statement that she did not feel safe to drive. In addition, the prosecutor asked defendant why she had not told Kritter about the nonalcoholic beers on the night of the incident. Defendant objected on the ground that the question inappropriately commented on defendant\u2019s right to remain silent, given the court\u2019s ruling that defendant had invoked that right, but the trial court overruled that objection and permitted the state to pursue that line of questioning. Then, in her closing argument, the prosecutor argued, repeatedly, that the jury should infer that defendant\u2019s testimony about consuming O\u2019Doul\u2019s was false because she had not mentioned the O\u2019Doul\u2019s on the night of the incident. Specifically, regarding the O\u2019Doul\u2019s, the state said, \u201c[W]hy on earth wouldn\u2019t she have just said that from the very beginning?\u201d The prosecutor further argued that defendant could have told Kritter about the O\u2019Doul\u2019s either at the MAX tracks or at the station house, \u201c[a]nd so she\u2019s given not one, but two different opportunities to explain, \u2018Officer, I just had three O\u2019Doul\u2019s, let\u2019s clear this up.\u2019\u201d Although defendant objected to that part of the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument as an impermissible comment on defendant\u2019s invocation of her right to remain silent, the trial court overruled that objection and the state reiterated its argument: \u201cThe point is, [defendant] never told [Kritter] that she had three O\u2019Doul\u2019s that night. And [defendant] had several opportunities to tell [Kritter], T only had three O\u2019Doul\u2019s, let\u2019s clear this up.\u201d The prosecutor made the same point again on rebuttal, arguing again that defendant never told Kritter about the O\u2019Doul\u2019s that night, although she could have done so \u201cat any point\u201d during their interaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-4\">The jury convicted defendant of DUII. Defendant waived her right to a trial by jury on the reckless driving charge, and the court convicted her on it. On appeal, as noted, defendant assigns error both to the trial court\u2019s overruling of defendant\u2019s objection to the state\u2019s inquiry into why defendant did not tell Kritter that she had the three O\u2019Doul\u2019s, and also to the trial court\u2019s overruling of defendant\u2019s objection to the prosecutor\u2019s argument that the jury should discredit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>defendant\u2019s O\u2019Doul\u2019s story because defendant had omitted to tell that story to Kritter. Defendant contends that the prosecutor\u2019s question and argument represented an impermissible comment on defendant\u2019s invocation of her state and federal constitutional right against self-incrimination. <em>See State v. Ragland, </em>210 Or App 182, 186-88, 149 P3d 1254 (2006) (discussing principle).</p>\n<p id=\"b399-4\">In response, the state first argues that, to the extent defendant challenges her reckless driving conviction, defendant failed to preserve any claim of error with respect to that conviction which, as noted, was tried separately to the trial court. The state also points out that defendant has not raised any specific arguments on appeal as to how the alleged errors affected her bench trial on the reckless driving charge and, for that reason, has not identified any grounds for reversal of that conviction. We agree with those arguments and affirm the judgment as to defendant\u2019s reckless driving conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">As to the DUII conviction, as we understand the state\u2019s argument, the state does not dispute (1) that defendant had the constitutionally protected right to remain silent at all pertinent times referenced by the prosecutor\u2019s question and argument,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> (2) that defendant had invoked that right to remain silent at all pertinent times, or (3) that the prosecutor\u2019s comments referred to that invoked right to remain silent and invited the jury to impeach defendant with the fact that she had remained silent, rather than telling Kritter about the O\u2019Doul\u2019s. Instead, the state argues that the prosecutor\u2019s question and closing arguments were a permissible way to impeach defendant\u2019s testimony that she had drank three O\u2019Doul\u2019s on the night in question. The state further argues that defendant \u201copened the door\u201d to that impeachment strategy by testifying both that she felt safe to drive on the night in question and that she had drank three O\u2019Doul\u2019s that night:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>\u201cThat is, defendant testified that she felt safe to drive that night because she had had only non-alcoholic beer to drink. The state was therefore entitled to impeach her testimony with her prior inconsistent statements that she did <em>not </em>feel safe to drive and did <em>not </em>tell Officer Kritter that she had only non-alcoholic beer.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b400-4\">Although the state is correct that it was entitled to impeach defendant\u2019s testimony about the O\u2019Doul\u2019s with her prior inconsistent <em>statements </em>on the night in question, that is not what the prosecutor did in the question and arguments challenged by defendant. The prosecutor did not limit her questions and argument to pointing out that defendant made affirmative statements on the night of the incident that were inconsistent with defendant\u2019s trial testimony that she had consumed only nonalcoholic beers. Rather, the prosecutor also repeatedly impeached defendant with her <em>silence </em>about consuming the O\u2019Doul\u2019s\u2014silence that the state has not disputed on appeal was the product of defendant\u2019s invocation of her constitutionally protected right to remain silent. As we explained in <em>Ragland, </em>except in limited circumstances,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> that strategy of impeachment, which calls attention to a defendant\u2019s failure to make certain statements during a time in which she has invoked her right to remain silent, is not constitutionally permissible. That is because it puts a defendant in the position of either explaining to the jury that she invoked her right to remain silent or, alternatively, not explaining to the jury that she invoked her right to remain silent \u201cand having the jury draw the prejudicial inference that the prosecutor posited based on her silence even when faced with arrest.\u201d <em>Ragland, </em>210 Or App at 188; <em>cf. Doyle v. Ohio, </em>426 US 610, 618, 96 S Ct 2240, 49 L Ed 2d 91 (1976) (stating that implicit in the <em>Miranda </em>warnings is the assurance that silence will carry no penalty); <em>United States v. Hale, </em>422 US 171, 183, 95 S Ct 2133, 45 L Ed 2d 99 (1975) (White, J., concurring in the judgment) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>(explaining that when a defendant is advised of the right to remain silent, due process does not permit a prosecutor to comment on that silence or to insist that the defendant\u2019s statements at trial are untrue because those statements were not made previously). Accordingly, we conclude that the trial court erred in overruling defendant\u2019s objections to the prosecutor\u2019s question and argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-4\">The question is whether that error is a reversible one. To determine whether it is reversible error to admit evidence of a defendant\u2019s exercise of his or her rights, we look to the likelihood that the jury would draw a prejudicial inference. <em>See Ragland, </em>210 Or App at 190-91 (citing <em>State v. Smallwood, </em>277 Or 503, 505-06, 561 P2d 600, <em>cert den, </em>434 US 849 (1977)); (\u201cThere is no doubt that it is usually reversible error to admit evidence of the exercise by a defendant of the rights which the constitution gives him if it is done in a context whereupon inferences prejudicial to the defendant are likely to be drawn by the jury.\u201d). Here, we are persuaded that the error is reversible. The prosecutor\u2019s question and argument, which repeatedly emphasized defendant\u2019s failure to mention the O\u2019Doul\u2019s to Kritter, permitted the jury to draw a negative inference regarding defendant\u2019s credibility from the fact that she had chosen to remain silent, under circumstances in which\u2014and, again, the state has not disputed the point in the context of this appeal\u2014defendant\u2019s silence was the product of defendant\u2019s invocation of her constitutionally protected right to remain silent. And, as defendant notes, the trial court did not take steps to ensure that the jury would not draw that prejudicial inference about defendant\u2019s credibility. Although it is true that the prosecutor impeached defendant with other permissible strategies, the prosecutor\u2019s repeated emphasis on defendant\u2019s failure to mention the O\u2019Doul\u2019s makes it likely that the jury drew the inference that prosecutor so strongly urged.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">In arguing for a different result, the state argues that defendant\u2019s failure to request a curative instruction or move for a mistrial precludes reversal. But it is apparent from the fact that the trial court permitted the prosecutor to pursue the challenged line of questioning and arguments <em>after </em>defendant\u2019s objections that the trial court overruled those objections. Under those circumstances, we conclude <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>that defendant was not also obligated to request a curative instruction or a mistrial once the court had overruled her objections in order to preserve her contention that the trial court committed reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-4\">The state also points to the fact that the prosecutor mentioned in her rebuttal argument that the jury should not infer defendant\u2019s guilt from the invocation of her right to remain silent, and argues that that argument prevented any prejudice to defendant. But the harm to defendant in this case does not derive from the fact that the jury heard about defendant\u2019s invocation of her right to remain silent (although that harm can be a cognizable one too). The harm is that the jury was permitted to draw a prejudicial inference about defendant\u2019s credibility from the mere fact that she remained silent about the O\u2019Doul\u2019s on the night of the incident at a time at which she had the right to remain silent and had invoked that right to remain silent.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">Reversed and remanded as to Count 1; otherwise affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b395-6\"> Article I, section 12, provides, in part, that \u201c[n]o person shall *** be compelled in any criminal prosecution to testify against himself.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b395-7\"> The Fifth Amendment provides, in part, that \u201c [n] o person *** shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself[.]\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b397-5\"> The correctness of that ruling is not at issue on appeal, and we express no opinion on it, except to note that under current Oregon law, it is debatable whether the right to remain silent under Article I, section 12, is implicated \u201cabsent custody or compelling circumstances.\u201d <em>See State v.

The Supreme Court observed on review of our decision in <em>Schiller-Munneman </em>that it has</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-6\">\u201cnot addressed whether, absent custody or compelling circumstances, a defendant\u2019s invocation of the right to silence in response to police questioning may be admitted as substantive evidence at trial. This court also has not addressed whether a defendant who remains silent must expressly invoke the right to silence, or whether, and under what circumstances, an invocation may be implied. Nor has this court decided whether invocation, express or implied, is necessary to trigger the protections of Article I, section 12.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b397-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 813.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b399-6\"> In particular, as noted earlier, the state has not argued below or on appeal that, under the reasoning of our decision in <em>Schiller-Munneman, </em>defendant did not have a constitutionally protected right to remain silent outside of custody or compelling circumstances, such that the prosecutor\u2019s references to defendant\u2019s invocation of her right to remain silent would be constitutionally permissible.
