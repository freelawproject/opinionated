In his second assignment of error, defendant argues that the trial court erred in denying his motion for judgment of acquittal because the evidence was legally insufficient to show that defendant caused the complainant a \u201cphysical injury\u201d as defined in ORS 161.015(7). The state concedes error on that assignment. We agree, accept the state\u2019s concession, and reverse. Because we reverse defendant\u2019s conviction on that basis, we do not address his other assignments of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-5\">As relevant here, ORS 163.160 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b742-6\">\u201c(1) A person commits the crime of assault in the fourth degree if the person:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b742-7\">\u201c(a) Intentionally, knowingly or recklessly causes physical injury to another!.]\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b742-8\">\u201cPhysical injury\u201d is defined by statute as \u201cimpairment of physical condition or substantial pain.\u201d ORS 161.015(7).</p>\n<p id=\"b742-9\">In this case, the trial court based its conviction of defendant on his causing the complainant \u201cimpairment of physical condition.\u201d We have determined that an \u201cimpairment of physical condition\u201d means \u201charm to the body that results in a reduction in one\u2019s ability to use the body or a bodily organ for less than a protracted period of time.\u201d <em>State v. Higgins, </em>165 Or App 442, 446-47, 998 P2d 222 (2000). The state concedes that the evidence in this case is legally insufficient to support a finding of \u201cphysical injury\u201d under the case law. We agree. The state presented no evidence that defendant caused the complainant a diminishment in the ability to use a body part or a disruption in the normal functioning of a bodily organ. Accordingly, we accept the state\u2019s concession and reverse defendant\u2019s judgment of conviction for fourth-degree assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-10\">Reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
