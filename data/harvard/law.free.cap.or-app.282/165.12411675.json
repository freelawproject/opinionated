On appeal, defendant raises two issues.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> First, he argues that the trial court erred by admitting into evidence parts of his recorded interrogation in which the interrogating detective expressed doubts that defendant was telling the truth. According to defendant, admission of those statements violated the prohibition on \u201cvouching\u201d evidence. Second, defendant challenges the denial of his motion to suppress statements that he made to a Department of Human Services (DHS) caseworker based on her failure to <em>re-Mirandize </em>defendant before questioning him. We conclude that the trial court did not err in either respect, and, accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">The relevant facts are largely procedural and undisputed. The victim, defendant\u2019s stepdaughter, sent a message to a friend stating that defendant had raped her. The friend\u2019s mother saw the message and reported it to the Oregon State Police. Detective Cuevas contacted Spitz, a DHS caseworker; Spitz interviewed the victim, who confirmed that defendant had raped her both in Oregon and in California. Cuevas and Spitz also spoke with the victim\u2019s mother, who agreed to call defendant and confront him regarding the victim\u2019s statements. During that telephone call, defendant told the mother that he could not remember whether he had had sexual relations with the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-6\">Later, at Cuevas\u2019s request, defendant agreed to submit to a recorded interview at the sheriffs office. Defendant was read his <em>Miranda </em>rights at approximately 5:00 p.m. and advised that he was free to leave at any time. When confronted with the allegations against him, defendant initially denied having sexual intercourse with the victim. Cuevas explained to defendant that his denials were not believable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>generally or not believable by a jury.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Defendant first replied that it was possible that he had had sexual intercourse with the victim and eventually admitted that he had sexual intercourse with the victim once in Oregon and on four occasions in California. In response, Cuevas thanked defendant for telling him the \u201ctruth\u201d and for \u201cbeing honest with [him].\u201d Defendant was placed under arrest at the conclusion of that interview. Later that evening, Cuevas telephoned Spitz at home to tell her that defendant had been arrested after having confessed.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-4\">At approximately 9:00 a.m. the following morning, Spitz made contact with defendant at the jail pursuant to a DHS policy that required her to perform a Child Protective Services assessment. Spitz introduced herself as a child-welfare worker and explained that she was \u201cdoing an investigation.\u201d Spitz also informed defendant that, in light of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>pending criminal case against him, he did not have to speak with her. Defendant replied that he had already shared everything with the police. Spitz then asked, \u201cwhy [the victim],\u201d to which defendant replied that the victim had \u201ccome on to him\u201d when he was drinking. In response to Spitz\u2019s follow-up question, \u201chow many times,\u201d defendant told her that he had sexual intercourse with the victim four times in California and once in Oregon.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-3\">Before trial, defendant moved to exclude numerous statements made by Cuevas during the recorded interrogation, arguing, among other things, that they amounted to impermissible \u201cvouching.\u201d Specifically, defendant objected to Cuevas\u2019s statements that: (1) \u201ckids don\u2019t make up this kind of stuff,\u201d and, if they do, their stories typically unravel rather quickly, and (2) defendant was being only about \u201c70 percent\u201d honest and needed \u201cto come all the way with [Cuevas] and tell [Cuevas] what happened.\u201d As for the latter statement, defendant cited other, similar comments by Cuevas during the interrogation in which Cuevas \u201crepeatedly told defendant that he needed to tell the truth,\u201d asked defendant \u201cto be honest with him,\u201d and said that, \u201cif [defendant] told [Cuevas] the truth, [Cuevas] would put that in his report, [and] not that story defendant had told him previously.\u201d The state responded that Cuevas\u2019s statements were relevant context to explain defendant\u2019s responses to the accusations, and to describe the progression of the interrogation. The trial court granted defendant\u2019s motion as to the first statement but not the second group of statements:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-4\">\u201c[The second statement] is a closer case. The detective tells the defendant that he needs to be honest with him. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-5\">\u201cThe, when the officer says he thinks the defendant\u2019s being 70 percent honest and to come clean with the rest of it, I, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s tantamount to calling the defendant a liar. <em>It\u2019s, number one, it\u2019s part of his conversation that the officer\u2019s having with him, and the officer\u2019s saying \u2018I think there\u2019s </em>more.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-6\">\u201cHe\u2019s not accusing the defendant of being a liar. He\u2019s accusing the defendant of not telling him everything. And that\u2019s a distinction with a difference. *\u215c\u215c [T]he officer is not saying the 70 percent you told him was a lie. The officer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>is saying \u2018I think you told me about 70 percent of the stuff,\u2019 and \u2018tell me what, the rest of what happened.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-4\">\u201cAnd the, the officer said \u2018if you want to stick with the story that you\u2019re giving me, that\u2019s fine.\u2019 And then he said * * * what the officer would do with the statements. The officer did as defense points out in his brief repeatedly\u2014by that I mean more than once because I didn\u2019t count it, but it was more than once\u2014told defendant that he should be honest with him, he should tell the truth.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-5\">\u201cBut I, I don\u2019t believe that the officer ever questioned *** the defendant\u2019s credibility or integrity to the point that it would get us into trouble with <em>Milbradt </em>or the other cases, <em>Lupoli </em>and some of the other, or even <em>McQuiston </em>and some of the others.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-6\">\u201cSo I think, although that\u2019s a close case, I\u2019m going to deny the motion as to [the second statement].\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b192-7\">(Emphasis added.) At trial, the state played a redacted recording of defendant\u2019s interrogation. The trial court also gave a limiting instruction, advising the jury that Cuevas\u2019s statements and questions during the interview \u201cshall not be heard as substantive evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b192-8\">Defendant also moved to suppress his statements to Spitz made on the morning following his arrest. Defendant argued that, at the time of the interview, Spitz was acting as a law enforcement agent and was therefore required to provide defendant with a new set of <em>Miranda </em>warnings before questioning him. The trial court denied the motion, explaining that there was \u201cno direct evidence *** of an agency\u201d between Spitz and the police that would have required Spitz to <em>Mirandize </em>defendant. Alternatively, the trial court reasoned that, even if Spitz <em>was </em>an agent of the police, the warnings administered by Cuevas the previous evening were sufficient to allow Spitz to question defendant the following morning:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-9\">\u201c[W]hen you take into account the short time frame of less than 16 hours and the fact that [Spitz] reminded [defendant] that he did not have to make a statement because he was being charged criminally, I believe that the combination of the * * * close time frame and the reminder of part of the <em>Miranda </em>rights was sufficient to allow a police <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>agent to continue the questioning of * * * defendant while in custody.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b193-4\">After a jury trial, defendant was convicted of two counts of first-degree rape.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">On appeal, in eight assignments of error, defendant challenges the trial court\u2019s rulings regarding both the Cuevas \u201cvouching\u201d statements and defendant\u2019s statements to Spitz. We address those issues in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-6\">According to defendant, the trial court\u2019s admission of Cuevas\u2019s statements regarding defendant\u2019s honesty ran afoul of the general rule that a witness may not comment on the credibility of another witness. <em>See, e.g., State v. Middleton, </em>294 Or 427, 438, 657 P2d 1215 (1983) (under Oregon law, \u201ca witness, expert or otherwise, may not give an opinion on whether he believes a witness is telling the truth\u201d); <em>State v. Milbradt, </em>305 Or 621, 629, 756 P2d 620 (1988) (\u201cThe assessment of credibility is for the trier of fact[.]\u201d). The state argues that none of the statements constitutes impermissible vouching because they were offered to provide context for defendant\u2019s responses during the interview, and not for the truth of the credibility opinions that Cuevas expressed.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We conclude that the trial court did not err, for the reasons articulated by the Oregon Supreme Court in its recent decision in <em>State v. Chandler, </em>360 Or 323, 380 P3d 932 (2016).</p>\n<p id=\"b193-7\">The facts of <em>Chandler </em>are very similar to those here. The defendant, who was suspected of sexual abuse, participated in a videotaped interview with the police in which he denied the allegations. <em>Id. </em>at 325. In response, the interviewing officer repeatedly said that she believed the victims and that the defendant was not being truthful.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 325-26. The trial court denied defendant\u2019s motion to redact those <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>statements as impermissible comments on credibility. <em>Id. </em>at 327.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-4\">On review before the Supreme Court, the issue was how the vouching rule, which developed as a principle applicable to in-court testimony, applies to a witness\u2019s <em>out-of-court </em>comments on credibility. <em>Id. </em>at 331. To answer that question, the court was required to reconcile the apparent tension between its decisions in <em>State v. Odoms, </em>313 Or 76, 83, 829 P2d 690 (1992) (explaining that \u201ca relevant out-of-court statement, recounted at trial, generally may not be excluded merely because it is phrased in the form of an opinion\u201d), and <em>State v. Charboneau, </em>323 Or 38, 48, 913 P2d 308 (1996) (holding that \u201c[a] witness\u2019s testimony or an exhibit may not, explicitly and directly, contain an opinion as to a trial witness\u2019s credibility\u201d). <em>Chandler, </em>360 Or at 333 (\u201cWhereas <em>Charboneau </em>stands for the proposition that a comment on a witness\u2019s credibility may not be introduced through either trial testimony or a trial exhibit, <em>Odoms </em>indicates that the vouching rule does not apply to credibility opinions rendered outside of court.\u201d). Recognizing that an out-of-court statement commenting on the credibility of a witness has the potential to become the functional equivalent of trial testimony if admitted into evidence, the court disavowed the reasoning of the majority in <em>Odoms </em>and instead adopted the following rule, originally articulated by Justice Unis in his concurrence in Odoms:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-5\">\u201cWhen a person makes an out-of-court statement about the credibility of a witness or non-witness complainant, that statement is subject to the categorical prohibition against vouching evidence only if the statement is offered for the truth of the credibility opinion that it expresses. Put another way, <em>a court does not err in admitting an </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number><em>out-of-court statement as to the credibility of a witness or nonwitness complainant if the statement is offered for a relevant, non-opinion </em>purpose.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b195-4\"><em>Chandler, </em>360 Or at 334 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">The Supreme Court affirmed the denial of the defendant\u2019s motion to redact the officer\u2019s statements, reasoning that those statements were offered not for the truth of the credibility opinions they expressed, but, rather, \u201cthe relevant, non-opinion purpose of providing context for the statements that defendant made during the interview.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 339.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\"><em>Chandler </em>is dispositive. The trial record supports the conclusion that Cuevas\u2019s statements were offered not for the truth of the credibility opinions that they expressed but for the \u201crelevant, non-opinion purpose\u201d of providing context for understanding defendant\u2019s responses. <em>Id. </em>at 334. At the suppression hearing, the trial court noted that the challenged statements were, first and foremost, \u201cpart of [the] conversation that the officer\u2019s having with [defendant]\u201d and made to elicit more forthcoming responses from defendant. And, although the trial court did not explicitly rule as to the purpose for which the statements were admitted, the trial court\u2019s limiting instruction clearly directed the jury <em>not </em>to regard Cuevas\u2019s statements as substantive evidence.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>See Chandler, </em>360 Or at 334 (\u201c[U]nder appropriate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>circumstances, a defendant may request a limiting instruction under OEC 105.\u201d). Finally, we note that the state did not highlight the credibility assessments either during its direct examination of Cuevas, or during its closing argument. For those reasons, we conclude that the trial court did not err when it denied defendant\u2019s motion to redact Cuevas\u2019s statement from the recording.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-4\">To the extent that defendant argues that the statements should have been excluded as unduly prejudicial under OEC 403, we reject that argument as unpreserved. The record reflects that, although defendant appears to have raised OEC 403 objections to other evidence below, he did not make an OEC 403 argument with respect to any of the statements that he identified as \u201cvouching.\u201d Accordingly, we decline to address that argument for the first time on appeal. <em>See Chandler, </em>360 Or at 337 (explaining that a vouching objection is distinct from an objection under OEC 403, and concluding that the defendant\u2019s \u201cbare citation to OEC 403, absent any developed argument under that rule, was insufficient to preserve his argument under the rule\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">We turn to the second issue raised by defendant, regarding whether Spitz, the DHS caseworker, violated his <em>Miranda </em>rights. As noted, defendant was read <em>Miranda </em>warnings at the beginning of his interrogation with Cuevas, at approximately .5:00 p.m. on the day of his arrest. However, defendant was not readvised of those rights before Spitz began asking him questions at 9:00 a.m. the following morning. According to defendant, that failure violated his rights under both the state and federal constitutions<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and required the exclusion of all of his statements to Spitz.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-6\">For purposes of our analysis, we assume, without deciding, that defendant is correct that Spitz was acting as an agent of the police and that the protections of the state and federal constitutions apply to her questioning of defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>Under Oregon law, to determine whether a defendant must be readvised of his <em>Miranda </em>rights, we look to whether, under the totality of the circumstances, a reasonable person could believe that his or her rights have changed since the time the warnings were originally given. <em>State v. Field, </em>231 Or App 115, 121, 218 P3d 551 (2009). The test under federal law is largely the same. <em>Id. </em>(\u201c[UJnder federal law, we must consider the totality of the circumstances to determine whether successive interrogations require a suspect to be re-advised of his <em>Miranda </em>rights [.] \u201d); <em>see also United States v. Rodriguez-Preciado, </em>399 F3d 1118, 1128 (9th Cir 2005) (\u201cThe Supreme Court has eschewed <em>per se </em>rules mandating that a suspect be re-advised of his rights in certain fixed situations in favor of a more flexible approach focusing on the totality of the circumstances.\u201d); <em>United States v. Andaverde, </em>64 F3d 1305, 1312 (9th Cir 1995) (\u201cThe courts have generally rejected a <em>per se </em>rule as to when a suspect must be re-advised of his rights after the passage of time or a change in questioners.\u201d). Thus, the question is whether, under the totality of the circumstances, a reasonable person in defendant\u2019s position would have understood his rights to have changed from the time that Cuevas <em>Mirandized </em>him to when Spitz visited him approximately 16 hours later.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-4\">We have previously deemed <em>Miranda </em>warnings to have maintained their validity after intervals equal to, or significantly greater than, that which occurred here. <em>See, e.g., Field, </em>231 Or App at 122 (police not required to readminister <em>Miranda </em>warnings on the second day of questioning); <em>Rodriguez-Preciado, </em>399 F3d at 1128-29 (upholding the admissibility of statements made approximately 16 hours after <em>Miranda </em>warnings were administered); <em>Andaverde, </em>64 F3d at 1313 (upholding as constitutional a one-day break between <em>Miranda </em>warnings and later interrogation). Moreover, defendant was either in the presence of the police or in custody from the time that he was advised of his <em>Miranda </em>rights until his interview with Spitz. <em>See Field, </em>231 Or App at 122 (noting that the defendant \u201cwas never outside the presence of the police from the time that he was first advised of his <em>Miranda </em>rights until the time of his arrest\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b198-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>Defendant points out that Spitz is not the person who gave him the <em>Miranda </em>warnings and that defendant had not had any interaction with Spitz before she arrived to question him. Under some circumstances, such as where it is unclear to a defendant that statements made to an interviewer can or will be used in court against him, that might be important. <em>Compare State v. Corbin, </em>15 Or App 536, 546-47, 516 P2d 1314 (1973) (concluding that a defendant was required, as a matter of law, to be readvised of his <em>Miranda </em>rights before a psychiatric examination to dispel any misapprehension about the confidential nature of a doctor-patient relationship), <em>with State v. Stein, </em>56 Or App 210, 215, 641 P2d 1148, <em>rev den, </em>293 Or 373 (1982) (upholding the validity of \u201cslightly truncated\u201d warnings given prior to a psychiatric interview where the defendant was made fully aware of the adversary nature of the interview). Here, however, nothing in the record suggests that a reasonable person in defendant\u2019s position would have been confused as to the nature of the interaction. Defendant was in custody, and Spitz identified herself as a member of Child Protective Services, informed defendant that she was \u201cdoing an investigation,\u201d and reminded him that he was under no obligation to speak with her given the pending criminal charges against him. <em>See State v. Hurtado-Navarrete, </em>258 Or App 503, 510, 309 P3d 1128, <em>rev den, </em>354 Or 656 (2013) (taking into account that the defendant had been reminded by detectives \u201cthat he had the right to an attorney and that he did not have to speak with them\u201d prior to questioning). Under those circumstances, we conclude that a reasonable person in defendant\u2019s circumstances would not have had any reason to believe that his rights had changed from the time of his <em>Miranda </em>warnings the previous evening to when Spitz began her questioning.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b189-7\"> This case is before us for the second time. In <em>State v. Codon, </em>247 Or App 756, 270 P3d 409 (2012) <em>(Codon </em>I), we reversed and remanded for a new trial based on the trial court\u2019s plain error in admitting into evidence a medical expert\u2019s diagnosis that the victim \u201chad been sexually abused\u201d in the absence of physical findings of abuse. <em>See State v. Southard, </em>347 Or 127, 218 P3d 104 (2009) (absent any physical evidence of abuse, a medical diagnosis of \u201csexual abuse\u201d is inadmissible under OEC 403).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b190-5\"> On appeal, defendant highlights the following seven statements made by Cuevas during the course of defendant\u2019s interrogation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-6\">(1) \u201cSo I guess, I guess the most concerning thing to me (inaudible) the red flag (inaudible), is this.

And I can see you act a certain way when you say something that\u2019s truthful and I see you act a different way when you\u2019re saying something that I already know is a lie.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-7\">\u201cSo it\u2019s kind of nice because you\u2019re lying!,] thinking you\u2019re helping yourself, but it\u2019s showing me what you look like and how your body reacts when you lie.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-8\">\u00ab\u215c \u215c\u215c\u215c\u2021</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-9\">\u201cBut right now you\u2019re already lying to me, so why would I believe who you\u2019re saying you are? It goes against what you\u2019re showing me that you are.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b194-10\">360 Or at 326-27 (brackets in original).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b195-7\"> The court rejected the defendant\u2019s alternative argument, that the statements were unfairly prejudicial under OEC 403, based on the defendant\u2019s failure to raise that objection below: \u201c[A] party\u2019s objection under the vouching rule is insufficient, by itself, to alert a trial court that the party also seeks OEC 403 balancing. Rather, a party must specifically raise an objection under OEC 403 to preserve an argument under that rule.\u201d <em>Chandler, </em>360 Or at 338.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b195-12\"> At the hearing on defendant\u2019s motion to exclude, the trial court suggested the following language for the limiting instruction:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b195-13\">\u201cTHE COURT: Okay. So \u2018the questions and statements of Senior Trooper or Detective Cuevas during his recorded interview of the defendant are not, or \u215c \u215c \u2021 may not be considered by you as, to be substantive evidence <em>but, rather, to be considered as part of the conversation with defendant.\u2019 </em>Or something like\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b195-14\">\u201cI mean, * <em>* * </em>I haven\u2019t put a lot of thought into that. * * * You guys can probably * * * come up with a better instruction than that.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b195-15\">(Emphasis added.)
