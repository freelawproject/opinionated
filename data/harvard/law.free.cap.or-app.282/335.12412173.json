His first assignment of error challenges the trial court\u2019s denial of defendant\u2019s motion to suppress evidence that the state obtained through a search of defendant\u2019s vehicle during a traffic stop. Defendant argues that the search was unlawful, despite defendant\u2019s voluntary consent to the search, because the request for consent to search followed an unlawful extension of the traffic stop. We conclude that the officer unlawfully extended the traffic stop when he questioned defendant about a new criminal matter without reasonable suspicion to investigate that crime, rather than going forward with processing the traffic infraction. The record does not permit us to affirm the trial court on the state\u2019s alternative theory, that the evidence need not be suppressed because defendant\u2019s consent to search was independent of the unlawful police conduct. Accordingly, we reverse without reaching several evidentiary challenges that defendant raises in his second through fourth assignments of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">I. FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b358-6\">We begin by describing the facts pertinent to defendant\u2019s motion to suppress, in a manner consistent with the trial court\u2019s ruling. <em>See State v. Watson, </em>353 Or 768, 796, 305 P3d 94 (2013) (\u201c [W] e are bound by the trial court\u2019s findings of historical fact to the extent that those findings are supported by evidence in the record.\u201d). Defendant was initially stopped because the sport utility vehicle (SUV) that he drove had no front license plate, a violation of ORS 803.540(1)(b). When the officer asked defendant if he knew that the SUV did not have a front license plate, defendant responded, \u201cNo, I didn\u2019t. It\u2019s not my car.\u201d When the officer asked who owned the car, defendant responded, \u201cMy\u2014my friend. I\u2019m just borrowing it.\u201d Defendant could not provide the registration for the SUV, but gave the officer his driver\u2019s license and an insurance card that named defendant as the insured. The insurance card specifically identified the SUV that defendant was driving and it had been issued several months before.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>The officer was suspicious that defendant was driving the SUV without permission, and therefore committing the crime of unauthorized use of a vehicle (UUV). <em>See </em>ORS 164.135. The officer returned to his patrol car and ran the license plate number through a database search, which told him the name of the registered owner and that the SUV had not been reported stolen. However, that did not eliminate the officer\u2019s suspicion that defendant was driving the SUV without permission, so he also ran defendant\u2019s name through various law enforcement databases in an effort to determine if defendant had some connection to the registered owner. The databases showed no connection between defendant and the registered owner.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-4\">The officer then returned to the car to ask more questions about defendant\u2019s connection to the registered owner of the SUV. The officer told defendant that the officer \u201cthought it was suspicious that he was borrowing a vehicle and that he had an insurance card with only his name on it.\u201d Defendant responded that he had \u201cbeen borrowing it for a little bit\u201d from a friend named \u201cDoug.\u201d Doug was not the name of the registered owner. Defendant also provided the officer with a phone number for \u201cDoug,\u201d and the officer returned to his car to call the number. The call was picked up by an answering machine that gave no name for the person to whom the number belonged. The officer remained concerned that defendant was using the SUV without permission, but he shifted to running a driving and \u201cwanted person inquiry\u201d on defendant. Defendant also had a passenger, and the officer ran a \u201cwanted person inquiry\u201d on her as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">While waiting for the results of those inquiries, the officer returned to defendant and asked him to step out of the SUV. In part, the officer made this request because, throughout the encounter, defendant had been watching the officer constantly through his side mirror, as if defendant were \u201ctracking\u201d him. In part, he made the request because the height of the SUV\u2019s windows prevented the officer from seeing defendant\u2019s hands, which the officer felt put him \u201cat a disadvantage.\u201d And in part, the officer asked defendant to step out because he still suspected that defendant was not \u201csupposed to have this vehicle.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b360-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>Once defendant had stepped out of the vehicle, the officer noticed a faint odor of marijuana coming from the vehicle. A question about the presence of \u201cguns, drugs, or illegal documents\u201d followed; defendant admitted to having \u201ca joint in the ashtray\u201d; and defendant then gave consent when the officer asked for permission to search the vehicle. The search of the vehicle revealed two packages of cocaine and a substantial amount of cash.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-4\">II. PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">Before trial, defendant moved to suppress the evidence that the police found in the vehicle. He argued that the officer lacked reasonable suspicion to extend the duration of the traffic stop to question defendant about the possible crime of UUV and also lacked a reasonable safety concern to justify having defendant step out of the vehicle and, thus, that the subsequent search was not lawful. The state argued that the officer did not unlawfully extend the duration of the traffic stop, because his initial questions into defendant\u2019s authority to use the SUV fell within the permissible scope of processing the traffic infraction, and that any investigation beyond the scope of a traffic stop was justified by reasonable suspicion that defendant was committing the crime of UUV. The state did not make the alternative argument that, even if the officer unlawfully extended the stop, the motion to suppress should be denied because defendant\u2019s consent to search was sufficiently attenuated from any such extension.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-6\">The trial court at one point expressed doubt that the officer had reasonable suspicion to investigate the crime of UUV, but denied defendant\u2019s motion to suppress because the court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-7\">\u201cIt was a lawful search. I don\u2019t think the officer went beyond the scope of what his investigation would allow. It was a search that\u2014that subject to-\u2014-he got proper consent.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b360-8\">A jury found defendant guilty, and he appeals from the judgment of conviction for unlawful delivery of cocaine, ORS 475.880, unlawful possession of cocaine, ORS 475.884, and criminal forfeiture, ORS 131.582.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>III. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b361-3\">On appeal, defendant does not challenge the trial court\u2019s determination that he voluntarily consented to the search. However, he argues that the evidence found during the search must be suppressed because defendant gave consent after the officer unlawfully extended the traffic stop to investigate the crime of UUV.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-4\">We begin with a review of relevant legal principles. Without a warrant or a valid exception to the warrant requirement, a search is <em>\u201c\u2018per se </em>unreasonable,\u201d\u2019 and in violation of Article I, section 9, of the Oregon Constitution. <em>State v. Unger, </em>356 Or 59, 72, 333 P3d 1009 (2014) (quoting <em>State v. Baker, </em>350 Or 641, 647, 260 P3d 476 (2011) (emphasis in original)). A defendant\u2019s voluntary consent to a search is one such exception. <em>State v. Musalf, </em>280 Or App 142, 151, 380 P3d 1087 (2016). However, if the consent follows an unlawful stop or unlawful search, evidence obtained in the search must, nevertheless, be suppressed if the police \u201cexploited [an] illegality\u201d to obtain the evidence. <em>Unger, </em>356 Or at 71. As the Supreme Court explained in <em>Unger,</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-5\">\u201cWhen, for example, the police stop an individual without reasonable suspicion, the individual\u2019s liberty is restrained in violation of Article I, section 9. Because the person stopped is unable to terminate the interaction with police, he or she is subject to police authority in excess of constitutional bounds and is thereby placed at a disadvantage relative to the constitutional position that he or she would have occupied in the absence of the illegal police interference.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b361-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 73. Thus, we first consider whether defendant\u2019s liberty was \u201crestrained in violation of Article I, section 9.\u201d <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b361-7\">A. <em>The Permissible Scope of the Traffic Stop</em></p>\n<p id=\"b361-8\">When an officer has probable cause to believe that a person has committed a traffic violation, the officer may lawfully stop the person and investigate. ORS 810.410(3)(b); <em>Watson, </em>353 Or at 774 (explaining that requiring a driver to pull over under those circumstances is a permitted \u201cstop and a seizure for Article I, section 9, purposes\u201d). However, both Article I, section 9, and ORS 810.410(3)(b), restrict the permissible scope of that stop to activities that are \u201c\u2018reasonably <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>related to that traffic infraction, the identification of persons, and the issuance of a citation (if any)[.]\u201d\u2019 <em>Watson, </em>353 Or at 778 (quoting <em>State v. Rodgers/Kirkeby, </em>347 Or 610, 623, 227 P3d 695 (2010)); <em>see also State v. Alvarado, </em>257 Or App 612, 627, 307 P3d 540 (2013) (explaining that an officer unlawfully extends a stop when, after the officer has all of the information necessary to complete the traffic investigation, the officer extends the duration of the stop by starting an investigation into a new matter that is unrelated to the traffic stop).</p>\n<p id=\"b362-4\">On appeal, there is no dispute that the officer had probable cause to stop defendant to investigate the traffic infraction of driving without a front license plate, ORS 803.540(l)(b). Defendant argues, however, that the officer\u2019s second round of questions\u2014after identifying the registered owner of the car\u2014went beyond those reasonably related to that traffic infraction. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-5\">We have explained that, although an officer conducting a traffic stop \u201cis free to question a motorist about matters unrelated to the traffic infraction during an unavoidable lull in the investigation, such as while waiting for the results of a records check,\u201d the officer is not \u201cfree to question the motorist about unrelated matters as an alternative to going forward with the next step in processing the infraction, such as the writing or issuing of a citation.\u201d <em>State v. Dennis, </em>250 Or App 732, 734, 282 P3d 955 (2012). Here, when the officer returned to question defendant about the name and contact information for the friend from whom defendant said he had borrowed the SUV, he was investigating his suspicions that defendant was committing the crime of UUV, a matter unrelated to the purpose of the traffic stop, instead of going \u201cforward with the next step in processing the infraction.\u201d Nor did the questioning occur during an \u201cunavoidable lull,\u201d because the officer testified that he returned to question defendant about his connection to the registered owner before running the license and \u201cwanted persons\u201d inquiries.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-6\">The state contends, however, that the officer\u2019s questions about defendant\u2019s permission to drive the vehicle were reasonably related to the traffic stop, because the officer sought to determine if defendant had permission to drive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>away at the end of the traffic stop. The state relies on <em>Watson, </em>in which the Supreme Court observed that \u201c[w]hen police officers detain a person on probable cause of violating a traffic law, it is reasonable to determine whether the person is licensed to continue on his or her way after the encounter ends.\u201d 353 Or at 782 (internal quotation marks omitted). But the state reads too much into that statement. <em>Watson\u2019s </em>reference to a \u201clicense to continue\u201d was a reference to a driver\u2019s license. The officer in <em>Watson </em>stopped the defendant for a traffic infraction and then conducted a \u201crecords check with the purpose of verifying defendant\u2019s driving privileges.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 782. The detention to complete that check was reasonably related to the investigation of a traffic stop unless \u201cunreasonably lengthy.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b363-4\">Here, the officer extended the duration of the traffic stop to investigate a matter beyond whether defendant had valid driving privileges. After his initial conversation with defendant, the officer was in possession of defendant\u2019s driver\u2019s license and could have proceeded with processing the traffic infraction, including running a records check to verify defendant\u2019s driving privileges. Instead, the officer moved on to investigating an unrelated matter\u2014the crime of UUV\u2014\u201cas an alternative to going forward with the next step in processing the infraction such as the writing or issuing a citation.\u201d <em>See Dennis, </em>250 Or App at 734 (internal quotation marks omitted). Thus, the officer had extended the stop beyond the limits that Article I, section 9, places on police activity during the lawful traffic stop. To justify that extension, the state needed to identify an \u201cindependent constitutional justification\u201d for the questioning. <em>Watson, </em>353 Or at 781.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">B. <em>Reasonable Suspicion to Investigate UUV</em></p>\n<p id=\"b363-6\">Defendant argues that the officer unlawfully extended the traffic stop because he lacked reasonable suspicion to conduct his investigation into whether defendant was committing the crime of UUV. <em>See State v. Barber, </em>279 Or App 84, 89, 379 P3d 651 (2016) (An officer\u2019s extension of a traffic stop to conduct a criminal investigation must be supported by reasonable suspicion in order to be lawful.). Reasonable suspicion to support a stop, including the extension of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>traffic stop, requires both that \u201c\u2018the officer subjectively believes that the person has committed or is about to commit a crime\u2019\u201d and that the officer\u2019s \u201c\u2018belief is objectively reasonable in light of the totality of the circumstances existing at the time of the stop.\u2019\u201d <em>State v. Bray, </em>281 Or App 435, 443, 380 P3d 1245 (2016) (quoting <em>State v. Maciel, </em>254 Or App 530, 535, 295 P3d 145 (2013)).</p>\n<p id=\"b364-4\">Although defendant does not dispute that the officer subjectively suspected defendant of committing the crime of UUV, he contends that the officer\u2019s suspicion was not objectively reasonable. Whether an officer has reasonable suspicion to extend a stop is determined as of the time that the stop becomes extended. <em>Alvarado, </em>257 Or App at 628. To be objectively reasonable, an officer\u2019s suspicion that the person has committed or is about to commit a crime \u201cmust be based on specific and articulable facts.\u201d <em>Bray, </em>281 Or App at 443 (internal quotation marked omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">The state argues that three facts gave the officer objectively reasonable suspicion, at the point that he extended the stop, that defendant was committing the crime of UUV: (1) the officer had observed defendant behave nervously; (2) defendant\u2019s response that he borrowed the vehicle from \u201ca friend\u201d was \u201cvague\u201d; and (3) the officer\u2019s database searches revealed no connection between defendant and the registered owner of the vehicle. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-6\">The first fact to which the state points\u2014defendant\u2019s nervous behavior\u2014adds little to the reasonable suspicion inquiry, as we have repeatedly emphasized. <em>See, e.g., Alvarado, </em>257 Or App at 629 (\u201cdefendant\u2019s anxious behaviors contribute very little to our reasonable suspicion calculus\u201d); <em>State v. </em>Meza-Garcia, 256 Or App 798, 804, 303 P3d 975 (2013) (\u201cdefendant\u2019s nervousness adds little, if any, weight toward reasonable suspicion\u201d); <em>State v. Berry, </em>232 Or App 612, 618, 222 P3d 758 (2009), <em>rev dismissed, </em>348 Or 71, 228 P3d 582 (2010) (\u201cthere is nothing inherently suspicious about * * * being nervous when pulled over by a police officer\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b364-7\">The second fact\u2014defendant\u2019s vague, or possibly evasive, statement that he was borrowing the SUV from \u201c[m]y\u2014my friend\u201d\u2014is similarly a fact that does little to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>make the officer\u2019s suspicion objectively reasonable. <em>See State v. Espinoza-Barragan, </em>253 Or App 743, 753, 293 P3d 1072 (2012) (facts that the defendant was nervous and was evasive about his intended destination, even considered in combination with other facts, did not give rise to reasonable suspicion); <em>see also Berry, </em>232 Or App at 617-18 (defendant\u2019s false explanation for turning into a particular parking lot, in combination with nervousness, furtive movements, and prior presence at a known location for drug trafficking did not give rise to reasonable suspicion that the defendant possessed drugs). Although the officer expected defendant to volunteer the name of the friend from whom he borrowed the car, the officer had not asked defendant to identify the friend, and defendant was under no obligation to volunteer that information. As we have held, a \u201cdefendant\u2019s evasive reaction to questioning that he [was] constitutionally entitled to refuse to answer,\u201d even in combination with past criminal activity, does not provide reasonable suspicion of current criminal activity. <em>See State v. Frias, </em>229 Or App 60, 65-66, 210 P3d 914 (2009) (concluding that the defendant\u2019s evasive response about why he had been visiting a friend, combined with officer\u2019s knowledge that the defendant had history of drug use, did not create reasonable suspicion of current drug use).</p>\n<p id=\"b365-4\">The remaining circumstance that the state identifies\u2014 the officer\u2019s inability to find a connection between defendant and the registered owner\u2014creates no reason to suspect that defendant was driving the vehicle without permission, at least given the other circumstances of this case. Although we evaluate whether the officer\u2019s suspicion is objectively reasonable \u201cin light of the officer\u2019s experience,\u201d <em>State v. Martin, </em>260 Or App 461, 470, 317 P3d 408 (2014), the officer offered no reason why he expected to find records in an official database to connect the owner of a vehicle to a \u201cfriend\u201d to whom the owner lent the vehicle. While finding a reported connection may have alleviated the officer\u2019s suspicion, the lack of a connection in official databases did not make his suspicion objectively reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">Moreover, any suspicion created by the identified facts must be considered in light of the other facts that were known to the officer at the time he extended the stop and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>which make any continuing suspicion of UUV not objectively reasonable. Specifically, when the officer searched the official databases to investigate his initial suspicion of UUV, his search confirmed that the SUV had not been reported stolen. <em>Compare State v. Ricks, </em>166 Or App 436, 440-42, 998 P2d 234, <em>adh\u2019d to as modified on recons, </em>168 Or App 552, 7 P3d 673, <em>rev den, </em>331 Or 429 (2000) (objectively reasonable suspicion that the defendant was driving a car without permission supported by fact that, when officer spoke with the registered owner\u2019s son, the son confirmed that to his knowledge there was no reason that the car should have been in the observed location or driven by a person matching the defendant\u2019s physical description). Although the officer explained that the lack of a theft report, in his experience, often just means that there has been a recent and not-yet reported theft, the possibility of that scenario is severely undermined by defendant\u2019s proof of insurance showing that he had been insured to drive the SUV for several months preceding the stop. As the trial court expressed it, \u201csomebody probably is not going to get insurance on a car that they\u2019ve stolen.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b366-4\">Even if the proof of insurance and lack of a theft report do not preclude the possibility that defendant was driving the SUV without permission, reasonable suspicion requires more. <em>See Alvarado, </em>257 Or App at 629 (although circumstances identified by the officer were consistent with criminal activity, they did not create objectively reasonable suspicion of criminal activity). Thus, at the time that the officer extended the traffic stop by returning to question defendant about his connection to the owner of the SUV, the officer did not have reasonable suspicion that defendant was committing a crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">C. <em>Validity of Consent Following an Unlawful Stop</em></p>\n<p id=\"b366-6\">That illegal extension of the traffic stop, given the record in this case, requires suppression of the evidence obtained from the search of the SUV. As the Supreme Court has explained, once a defendant who challenges the validity of consent to search establishes that his or her consent followed an illegal stop or an illegal search, \u201cthe state bears the burden of demonstrating\u201d not only that the consent was voluntary but also that \u201cthe voluntary consent was not the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>product of police exploitation of the illegal stop or search.\u201d <em>Unger, </em>356 Or at 75. That exploitation analysis requires the court to consider whether the state proved that \u201cthe consent was independent of, or only tenuously related to, the unlawful police conduct.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 86.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-4\">Here, both the state and defendant agree that the information that the officer learned during the unlawful extension of the stop further heightened his suspicion that defendant was not authorized to be driving the vehicle. Specifically, in response to that additional questioning, defendant told the officer that he was borrowing the SUV from \u201cDoug,\u201d a name that the officer knew to be different from the name of the registered owner. Moreover, defendant provided the officer with a telephone number for Doug that went to an answering machine with a generic message. The officer testified that his continuing suspicion that defendant was not authorized to use the SUV contributed to his request that defendant step out of the car. And, that action led to additional discoveries that made the officer suspect the presence of marijuana in the SUV and, ultimately, to request consent to search.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">The state, nevertheless, argues that defendant\u2019s consent to search was sufficiently attenuated from the unlawful conduct that we should affirm the trial court\u2019s denial of defendant\u2019s motion to suppress. The state\u2019s primary argument for why the officer did not exploit the unlawful extension is that, when the officer asked defendant to step out of the vehicle, he was \u201cmotivated chiefly by safety concerns rather than defendant\u2019s answers to the purportedly unlawful questions [.] \u201d The state points to the officer\u2019s \u201cconcern that he could not see defendant\u2019s hands,\u201d and the fact that defendant was \u201cunable to take his eyes off of [the officer].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b367-6\">The state did not argue below that the motion to suppress should be denied, regardless of any purported unlawful extension, because the request to search was sufficiently attenuated from any such extension.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Moreover, the trial court did not address whether defendant\u2019s consent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>to search was the product of police exploitation of a prior unlawful extension. Thus, we understand the state\u2019s argument to urge us to affirm the trial court ruling as right for the wrong reason.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-4\">In order to affirm a trial court\u2019s ruling on a basis other than which the court relied, \u201c(1) \u2018the facts of record [must] be sufficient to support the alternative basis for affirmance\u2019; (2) \u2018the trial court\u2019s ruling [must] be consistent with the view of the evidence under the alternative basis for affirmance\u2019; and (3) \u2018the record [must] materially be the same one that would have been developed had the prevailing party raised the alternative basis for affirmance below.\u2019\u201d <em>State v. Booth, </em>272 Or App 192, 199, 355 P3d 181 (2015) (quoting <em>Outdoor Media Dimensions, </em>Inc. <em>v. State of Oregon, </em>331 Or 634, 659-60, 20 P3d 180 (2001)). Thus, \u201ceven if the record contains evidence sufficient to support an alternative basis for affirmance, if the losing party might have created a <em>different </em>record below had the prevailing party raised that issue, and that record could affect the disposition of the issue, then we will not consider the alternative basis for affirmance.\u201d <em>Outdoor Media Dimensions, Inc., </em>331 Or at 660 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">We conclude, as we did in <em>Booth, </em>that we cannot affirm the trial court on the alternative basis proposed by the state because \u201cthe trial court did not engage in the fact-specific inquiry necessary to determine whether the state had carried its burden of proving that \u2018the consent was independent of, or only tenuously related to, the unlawful police conduct[.]\u2019\u201d 272 Or App at 199 (quoting <em>Unger, </em>356 Or at 86). In particular, the key premise of the state\u2019s attenuation argument is that the officer\u2019s decision to have defendant step out of the car was primarily unrelated to his suspicion that defendant was committing the crime of UUV\u2014 suspicion that was enhanced by the information that the officer obtained through the unlawful extension of the traffic stop. Yet, as indicated above, the officer testified that his suspicion that defendant was not authorized to use the SUV contributed to his decision to have defendant step out of the vehicle. Even if the trial court could have found that the contribution from the unlawful extension was only tenuous, the trial court did not engage in that necessary factual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>inquiry. Thus, we cannot determine, for the first time on appeal, whether the state carried \u201cits burden of proving that the consent was independent of, or only tenuously related to, the unlawful police conduct [.] \u201d <em>See Booth, </em>272 Or App at 199 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b369-3\">The state does not ask us to remand for further findings related to the suppression motion, and, in any event, we have previously declined to remand under similar circumstances. <em>See Jones, </em>275 Or App at 776 (rejecting state\u2019s argument that case should be remanded based on fact <em>Unger </em>had not been decided at time of suppression hearing, because \u201cthe burden has long been on the state to establish attenuation\u201d and the factors set forth in <em>Unger </em>\u201cas pertinent to the attenuation analysis are not new\u201d). Therefore, we conclude that the court erred in denying defendant\u2019s motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-4\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b367-7\"> Although the Supreme Court decided Unger after the suppression hearing and trial in this case, \u201cthe burden has long been on the state to establish attenuation.\u201d <em>State v.
