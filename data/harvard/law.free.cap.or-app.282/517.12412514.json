He petitions for post-conviction relief on a variety of grounds, including that his trial lawyer was constitutionally inadequate and ineffective in numerous respects. In a detailed opinion, the post-conviction court concluded that the bulk of petitioner\u2019s allegations did not warrant post-conviction relief. However, the court determined that petitioner was entitled to relief on his claim that trial counsel was inadequate for not excepting to the trial court\u2019s failure to deliver a jury concurrence instruction with respect to Count 46 of the indictment, which charged petitioner with third-degree sexual abuse. Specifically, relying on our decision in <em>Hale v. Belleque, </em>255 Or App 653, 298 P3d 596, <em>adh\u2019d to on recons, </em>258 Or App 587, 312 P3d 533, <em>rev den, </em>354 Or 597 (2013), the court concluded that, because of the similarity between the allegations underlying Count 42, which charged petitioner with sexual abuse in the second degree, and those underlying Count 46, trial counsel was inadequate for not requesting a specific concurrence instruction informing the jury that at least 10 jurors had to agree on the specific factual occurrence that formed the basis for the conviction on Count 46. The court further concluded, again relying on <em>Hale, </em>that petitioner was prejudiced by trial counsel\u2019s inadequacy because, under <em>Hale, </em>\u201c[prejudice inures in that it is not possible on the record to determine which underlying facts formed the basis for the conviction.\u201d The court then determined that merger of Count 42 and Count 46 was the appropriate remedy for trial counsel\u2019s inadequacy with respect to the omission of a concurrence instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">Both petitioner and defendant, the superintendent of Two Rivers Correctional Institution, appeal.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Petitioner assigns error to the post-conviction court\u2019s denial of relief with respect to a number of his other alleged grounds for relief. The superintendent assigns error to the post-conviction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>court\u2019s grant of relief as to petitioner\u2019s jury concurrence instruction claim. We reject petitioner\u2019s assignments of error without written discussion and, for the reasons that follow, conclude that the trial court erred in granting relief on petitioner\u2019s claim regarding the omission of a jury concurrence instruction. We therefore reverse and remand for entry of a judgment denying the petition for post-conviction relief in its entirety.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-4\">As noted, the post-conviction court granted relief based on its determination that trial counsel was constitutionally inadequate and ineffective for not excepting to the trial court\u2019s failure to deliver a jury concurrence instruction with respect to Count 46. According to the verdict form, Count 46 was based on petitioner\u2019s \u201c[s]exual contact with penis of [JD], then under 18, 8/25/02-11/5/02, dead end road off 82nd St.\u201d The court noted that Count 46 was similar to Count 42\u2014which, according to the verdict form, was based on petitioner\u2019s \u201c [d] eviate sexual intercourse (oral sex) with [JD], without consent, 8/25/02-11/5/02, dead fend road off 82nd St\u201d\u2014and, as we understand the court\u2019s reasoning, concluded that reasonable trial counsel would have excepted to the trial court\u2019s failure to give a jury concurrence instruction as to Count 46 because there were multiple factual scenarios as to how the alleged contact \u201cwith [the] penis of [JD] \u201d could have occurred during the 82nd Street incident\u2014 either through the same oral contact alleged in Count 42, or through a touching by hand over, and then under, the victim\u2019s clothing. The post-conviction court then concluded that, under <em>Hale, </em>petitioner had established prejudice as a matter of law, because it was not possible to determine how the jury reached its verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">We review the post-conviction court\u2019s judgment for legal error, accepting as true the court\u2019s supported factual findings. <em>Green v. Franke, </em>357 Or 301, 312, 350 P3d 188 (2015). To be entitled to relief on the claim at issue, petitioner was required to prove two elements: that his trial lawyer failed to exercise reasonable professional skill and judgment by not excepting to the trial court\u2019s failure to deliver a jury concurrence instruction with respect to Count 46, and that petitioner was prejudiced by that deficiency in counsel\u2019s performance. <em>Mellerio v. Nooth, </em>279 Or App 419, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>428-29, 379 P3d 560 (2016). For purposes of this appeal, we assume without deciding that the post-conviction court was correct in ruling that trial counsel performed deficiently. Nevertheless, in the light of our recent decision in <em>Mellerio, </em>which altered the <em>Hale </em>prejudice analysis on which the post-conviction court relied, we conclude that the post-conviction court erred in determining that petitioner was prejudiced as a result of any deficiency in trial counsel\u2019s performance.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-4\">In <em>Mellerio, </em>as here, we addressed claims that the petitioner\u2019s trial counsel had been inadequate and ineffective for not requesting jury concurrence instructions with respect to several of the charges against the petitioner. In so doing, we concluded that the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>State v. Ashkins, </em>357 Or 642, 357 P3d 490 (2015), required a \u201cconsiderably more nuanced\u201d approach to assessing whether the omission of a jury concurrence instruction prejudiced a post-conviction petitioner \u201cthan the ostensibly categorical construct we applied in <em>Haler Mellerio, </em>279 Or App at 434. That \u201cmore nuanced\u201d approach requires a practical focus on the record in the case, including the parties\u2019 theories of the case and the evidence presented, to assess whether the omission of a concurrence instruction had a tendency to affect the verdict in the criminal case. <em>Id. </em>(holding that the <em>Ashkins </em>method for determining whether the erroneous omission of a concurrence instruction is harmless in the context of a direct appeal governs the analysis of whether a post-conviction petitioner was prejudiced by the omission of a concurrence instruction as a result of trial counsel\u2019s inadequacy); <em>see Wilson v. Premo, </em>280 Or App 372, 386, 381 P3d 921 (2016) (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">Applying the <em>Ashkins </em>approach here, we are persuaded that petitioner was not prejudiced by the omission of a concurrence instruction as to Count 46. The record, viewed as a whole, refutes the possibility that the jurors were divided as to the factual occurrence that supplied the basis for that conviction, notwithstanding the trial court\u2019s failure to deliver a jury concurrence instruction specifically addressing Count 46.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">As an initial matter, after discussing with the parties how to ensure that the jury found that each count <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>was based on distinct occurrences, the trial court specially instructed the jury that, as to each count, 10 or more jurors were required to agree both that \u201cthe act\u201d underlying the count occurred, and on the \u201cspecific occasion\u201d underlying that count:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-4\">\u201cThis being a criminal case, on each count charged, 10 or more jurors must agree on your verdict. As to each crime, each victim, and each count alleged, to return a verdict of guilty, 10 or more jurors must agree that the act occurred as alleged in that count and on a specific occasion distinct from any other occasion.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">That instruction alerted the jury of the need for concurrence as to specific conduct underlying the jury\u2019s determination of guilt on any particular count. Although that instruction did not highlight the need for concurrence with respect to the conduct underlying Count 46, given its plain terms, the jury would have understood the instruction to apply to all counts charged, including Count 46. The jury thus likely would have understood that it had to have the requisite concurrence as to the \u201cspecific occasion\u201d of \u201csexual contact with [the] penis of [JD] \u201d underlying Count 46.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-6\">Beyond that, the evidence developed at trial, the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument, and the verdict form, taken together, make it unlikely that the jury convicted petitioner of Count 46 without the required concurrence. JD\u2019s testimony supplied the evidence in support of both Count 42 and Count 46. As to those counts, JD testified that one morning after petitioner had picked him up from his foster home, petitioner parked on a dead-end street off of 82nd Street near Helensview School in Portland and then touched JD\u2019s genitals, first over his clothes and then under his clothes. Then, JD testified, petitioner placed his mouth on JD\u2019s penis and began performing oral sex. In closing argument, the prosecutor emphasized that Count 42 was predicated on the oral sex that took place during that particular incident, and that Count 46 was predicated on the touching of JD\u2019s penis over and under his clothes that took place during the same incident:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-7\">\u201cCount 42, Sex Abuse in the Second Degree, for [JD]. [JD] describes how he\u2019s living at the * * * foster home and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>that this happens before school, that he goes to this dead-end road, that he\u2019s touched over the clothes and under the clothes, that he\u2019s threatened to go to jail, and that oral sex was performed on him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-4\">\u00ab\u215c\u2021\u215c\u2021\u215c</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-5\">\u201cCount 46, Sex Abuse in the Third Degree. Defendant picks him up at the *** foster home in the morning. Defendant drives to the dead-end road on Helens View [sic]. Defendant touches [JD\u2019s] penis over his clothes and then under his clothes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b545-6\">The verdict form then underscored the state\u2019s theory of the case, describing Count 42 specifically as being about the \u201coral sex\u201d that occurred during the 82nd Street incident, and Count 46 as being about the \u201csexual contact with [the] penis of [JD] \u201d that took place at 82nd Street. In view of JD\u2019s testimony about the 82nd Street event; the prosecutor\u2019s explanation that Count 42 was predicated on the oral sex during the 82nd Street incident and that Count 46 was predicated on the touching of JD\u2019s penis over and under his clothes during the 82nd Street event; and the verdict form\u2019s confirmation that Count 42 was about the oral sex at 82nd Street and that Count 46 was about the contact with JD\u2019s penis at 82nd Street, there is little likelihood that the jury failed to concur on the factual occurrence underlying Count 46. The only factual basis for that charge that was urged to the jury was petitioner\u2019s act of touching JD\u2019s penis over and under JD\u2019s clothes during the 82nd Street incident. Under those circumstances, there is no reason to think that the members diverged in their views as to what conduct constituted that offense, and petitioner was not prejudiced by the omission of a jury concurrence instruction targeting Count 46. The trial court\u2019s contrary conclusion\u2014although consistent with Hale\u2014therefore is erroneous in the light of the \u201cmore nuanced\u201d approach to prejudice that we have since adopted in <em>Mellerio.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b545-7\">We must address one additional point. The superintendent points out that, although it is not entirely clear from the post-conviction court\u2019s decision, the court may also have determined that petitioner is entitled to post-conviction relief based on trial counsel\u2019s failure to argue to the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>court that petitioner\u2019s conviction on Count 42 should merge with his conviction on Count 46, even though the claim on which the court expressly granted relief was petitioner\u2019s claim that trial counsel was inadequate and ineffective for not excepting to the omission of a concurrence instruction. The superintendent contends that, to the extent the post-conviction court\u2019s judgment can be construed to grant relief based on trial counsel\u2019s failure to urge merger, the judgment is erroneous. We agree. The post-conviction petition does not allege a claim that trial counsel was inadequate and ineffective for failing to argue merger with respect to Counts 42 and 46. That omission precludes post-conviction relief on the ground that trial counsel was inadequate and ineffective on that basis. <em>Hendricks v. Hill, </em>209 Or App 812, 813, 149 P3d 318 (2006) (a post-conviction court cannot grant relief on a claim not alleged in the petition); <em>Bowen v. Johnson, </em>166 Or App 89, 92-93, 999 P2d 1159, <em>rev den, </em>330 Or 553 (2000) (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b546-4\">Affirmed on appeal; reversed and remanded for entry of judgment denying petition on cross-appeal.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b541-6\"> The original defendant on appeal was the administrator of Northern Oregon Regional Correctional Facilities, which then had custody of petitioner.
