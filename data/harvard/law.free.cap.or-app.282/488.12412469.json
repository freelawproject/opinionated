J.</author>\n<p id=\"b512-4\">Father appeals judgments terminating his parental rights with respect to his three sons, EM, EJ, and X. The trial court ruled that father\u2019s rights should be terminated on the basis of unfitness, particularly because of father\u2019s personality disorder, anger management problems, housing instability, and failure to make a lasting adjustment to those conditions and circumstances. On <em>de novo </em>review, ORS 19.415(3)(a), we find that the Department of Human Services (DHS) has failed to prove by clear and convincing evidence that father\u2019s conduct or conditions are seriously detrimental to his children; accordingly, we reverse the trial court\u2019s judgments.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"ACV\">A. <em>Procedural History</em></p>\n<p id=\"b512-6\">The parties generally agree on the chronology of events leading to the termination proceedings. Father and mother have three children together: twins EM and E J, who were born in December 2011, and X, who was born in May 2013. Mother also has three other children from another relationship: twins EB and A, born in April 2004, and G, born in July 2007. Before the state\u2019s most recent involvement with the family, all six children were living with mother and father.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-7\">DHS became involved with the family in May 2013, when X was born with methadone and marijuana in his system. The children, including X, remained with mother and father at that time, but DHS continued to monitor the case. Then, in July 2013, mother and father separated. The three youngest children, EM, EJ, and X, continued to live with mother, but the three oldest children went to stay with their paternal grandparents because mother was struggling to care for all six children and find suitable housing.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-8\">The following month, on August 9, 2013, X was rushed to the emergency room by his babysitter. X was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>wheezing, his body was cold, and he appeared to be having a seizure. He was admitted at the hospital for failure to thrive and a saline imbalance, which produced the seizures.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On August 12, 2013, DHS filed a petition to take jurisdiction over X on the grounds that mother had a substance abuse problem that, left untreated, interferes with her ability to parent; that X was diagnosed with nutritional neglect and that mother needs the state\u2019s help to learn the skills necessary to adequately care for X; and that father lacks suitable housing for X and needs the state\u2019s assistance to obtain suitable housing.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-4\">Shortly thereafter, all six children were taken into protective custody after medical examinations of the younger twins, EM and EJ, revealed fractures believed to be indicative of child abuse. In its petition to take jurisdiction over EM and EJ, DHS alleged, in addition to allegations regarding mother\u2019s substance abuse and father\u2019s housing, that the children had \u201csuffered injuries including an untreated diaper rash, bruising and a metaphyseal fracture that is indicative of child abuse.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\">It was subsequently determined that the \u201cfractures\u201d on EM and EJ were actually birth defects, not the result of child abuse. However, in November 2013, mother and father admitted other bases for jurisdiction: Mother admitted that she had a substance abuse problem that, left untreated, interferes with her parenting, and father admitted that he lacked suitable housing for the family. Thus, in November 2013, the court entered jurisdictional judgments with regard to all three of mother and father\u2019s biological children. Meanwhile, the three oldest children, EB, A, and G, were returned to their biological father and, later, foster care.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b513-6\">Mother and father separated again in June 2014, and, by July 2014, father\u2019s visits had been canceled because he missed three in a row. On July 30, 2014, DHS filed new <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>petitions for EM, E J, and X that alleged additional bases for jurisdiction with regard to father. The petitions alleged that each child is \u201cin need of specialized medical treatment and oversight that the father cannot or is otherwise unwilling to provide\u201d; that, \u201c[d] espite having been offered services to address the father\u2019s parenting problems that interfere with his ability to safely parent the child, he has been unable to remedy the problem\u201d; and that \u201c[fjather has an anger control problem and mental health issues that, left unremedi-ated, interferes with his ability to safely parent the child.\u201d In October 2014, father did not appear for the jurisdictional hearing, and the court entered jurisdictional judgments on those petitions.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-4\">In December 2014, the court changed the permanency plan from reunification to adoption for EM, E J, and X. Father, after being absent for a period of time, showed up for that hearing and requested reinstatement of visits. Father resumed visits with EM, EJ, and X in late January 2015.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">By the time that his visits resumed, DHS had filed a petition to terminate his parental rights to his three children. The petitions alleged as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-6\">\u201cThe parental rights of the father to the above-named child should be terminated under ORS 419B.504 on the grounds that the father is unfit by reason of conduct or condition seriously detrimental to the child and integration of the child into the father\u2019s home is improbable within a reasonable time due to conduct or conditions not likely to change, including, but not limited to the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-7\">\u201c(a) Exposure of the child to domestic violence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-8\">\u201c(b) Lack of effort or failure to obtain and maintain a suitable or stable living situation for the child so that return of the child to the parent is possible.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-9\">\u201c(c) Failure to present a viable plan for the return of the child to the parent\u2019s care and custody.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-10\">\u201c(d) Failure to learn or assume parenting skills sufficient to provide a safe and stable home for the raising of the child.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-11\">\u201c(e) An emotional illness, mental illness, or mental deficiency of such nature and duration as to render the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>parent incapable of providing care for extended periods of time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-4\">\u201c(f) Physical and emotional neglect of child.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-5\">\u201c(g) Lack of effort to adjust the parent\u2019s circumstances, conduct or conditions to make return of the child to the parent possible.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-6\">\u201c(h) Failure to effect a lasting adjustment after reasonable efforts by available social agencies for such extended duration of time that it appears reasonable that no lasting adjustment can be effected.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b515-7\">B. <em>Termination Proceedings</em></p>\n<p id=\"b515-8\">The termination trial began on June 10, 2015, and, after two days of testimony, was continued until September 28, 2015. At the trial, the parties presented the following evidence, much of which focused on DHS\u2019s theme that father was angry and potentially abusive, including toward DHS, which hampered the state\u2019s efforts to help father attain the parenting skills and stability necessary for reunification.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-9\">1. <em>Father\u2019s mental health, anger issues, and use of discipline</em></p>\n<p id=\"b515-11\">a. Disclosures of \u201cexcessive discipline\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b515-12\">Some of DHS\u2019s initial concerns about father\u2019s anger and mental health issues stemmed from comments made by two of mother\u2019s older children, A and EB, during their mental health assessments. During her assessment, A expressed dislike for father and how he treated them when they were younger. A\u2019s assessment states, \u201cPast concerns related to [father] using excessive physical discipline toward [A] and her siblings,\u201d and A and her siblings expressed that they did not want to live in mother\u2019s home if father were there as well. EB likewise had reported that father would often spank him and punished him for behaviors like taking food from a friend or accidentally urinating on the toilet seat.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-13\">b. Psychological evaluation</p>\n<p id=\"b515-14\">After DHS filed the amended petitions to include allegations regarding father\u2019s mental health and anger issues, father was ordered to submit to a psychological <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>examination, which took place in August 2014. The examining psychologist, Dr. Cook, found that father had \u201cborderline intellectual functioning\u201d and diagnosed him with a depressive disorder not otherwise specified, a generalized anxiety disorder, and an antisocial personality disorder.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-4\">Cook noted that father was a \u201cchallenging client\u201d who was \u201copenly hostile to DHS.\u201d Father blamed DHS for many of his struggles, expressing the view that \u201che lost the [Temporary Assistance to Needy Families] grant when the children were removed and in the aftermath has struggled to pay bills, has been evicted twice, and has had to find a job.\u201d At the same time, father was \u201ccandid in admitting fault\u201d with regard to his parenting skills. Father admitted that he \u201cyelled too much, was impatient, and that he sometimes scared his children.\u201d Cook also reported that father admitted \u201cthat he took discipline too far at times but claims that he was never physically abusive.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">Cook ultimately opined that father \u201cexpresses a genuine love and attachment for his 3 young sons [EM, E J and X], but his cognitive and psychological issues impair his abilities and manifest in parenting skills which place his children at risk of further harm.\u201d As part of his August 2014 evaluation, Cook had recommended that father sign up for parenting classes, a domestic violence assessment, and drug abuse screen; he also recommended mental health counseling and consistent visitation with the children.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-6\">c. Domestic violence assessment and DV status report</p>\n<p id=\"b516-7\">The state also offered testimony from Dr. Carter, who conducted a domestic violence assessment in March 2015. Following the assessment, which showed that father scored high with regard to \u201cpsychological violence,\u201d father participated in treatment with Carter. Father was continuing that treatment when trial began in June 2015, including preparing for a \u201cfull disclosure polygraph\u201d scheduled for August 2015. However, in late July 2015, father was terminated from the program for \u201ccontinued drug use\u201d (marijuana) and \u201cwithdrawing his consent to share progress notes and polygraph results with the family court system.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b517-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>When the trial resumed in September, Carter testified that father had been making progress, having attended 8 of the 36 classes in the program; however, Carter also testified that father had made concerning disclosures related to abuse during his preparations for the polygraph. For instance, in response to a question about past physical violence, father \u201ctalked about beating up a man in front of his family; this man apparently walked up and laid hands on his child.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b517-4\">Carter further testified that father had \u201cno plan\u201d to eliminate all forms of violence in his life. According to Carter, father had told her that he was only willing to curb his violent tendencies to get his children back, and that he would otherwise revert to his previous ways.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">d. Father\u2019s testimony</p>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">Father, during his testimony at the termination trial, acknowledged that he had used physical discipline on the children, but he testified that \u201c[t]he only time I have ever spanked my children was severe, severe incidents where they\u2019d be either hurt somebody else or they\u2019ve done\u2014stole something or anything like that, you know.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b517-7\">Father also acknowledged that he had a violent past and had been confrontational, but he testified that he had not had any contacts with police for the past 15 years and denied ever being physically violent toward mother or any women. With regard to the incident in which father beat up a man in front of his family, father testified that, as he was leaving a park, someone who lived \u201cin the apartment complex\u201d and looked \u201ca little drunk\u201d had threatened and bumped into father while he was holding E J, who was still a baby. Father testified that he handed E J to mother and then beat up the man, which he characterized as \u201cneutraliz [ing] that threat.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b517-8\">e. Popov testimony</p>\n<p id=\"b517-9\">Popov, a clinical social worker who had been working with father since June 2015, also testified about father\u2019s anger issues. Popov testified that father\u2019s treatment goals \u201cabsolutely\u201d revolve around \u201chis emotional regulation and anger <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>and violence.\u201d He explained that, when under stress, \u201conce [father] crosses a certain threshold it becomes very hard for him to delineate * * * what\u2019s the right response to this.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b518-4\">Popov was asked about prior statements in evidence that father had made about getting into \u201cbar fights\u201d and \u201cfight [ing] guys in the streets all the time.\u201d Popov stated that he had heard father \u201cmake similar statements when he was emotionally pretty disorganized and upset about an issue,\u201d because talking about getting into fights is his \u201cgo to, verbal anxiety identification statement.\u201d Popov testified that he was working with father to find strategies that would help him to a \u201ccalm state so that [father] can actually solve the problem instead of creating more problems.\u201d Yet Popov was also asked, \u201cDo you think his violence has him so impaired he can\u2019t parent or he\u2019d be unsafe?\u201d Popov answered, \u201cI don\u2019t think he\u2019s unsafe.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">2. <em>Father\u2019s engagement with mental health and counseling services</em></p>\n<p id=\"b518-6\">DHS presented evidence that father\u2019s engagement with mental health and counseling services was limited, at best. Without belaboring the matter, DHS offered evidence that father\u2019s efforts to address some of the issues that were identified by DHS\u2014specifically, his mental health and anger issues\u2014were marked by distrust of DHS and poor follow through. Father did not engage in services until February 2015, and then, after engaging in domestic violence services with Carter, he was terminated only a quarter of the way into the program for failing to comply with the provider\u2019s rules regarding marijuana use and disclosure of information. Father offered evidence that he had successfully engaged in services with Popov, who testified that he and father were \u201cmaking headway; more than I expected. And his commitment is more than I expected. I really didn\u2019t think I\u2019d hear from him so, you know, it was a pleasant surprise to have him call and schedule appointments.\u201d However, that relationship did not begin until after the termination trial had already begun, and Popov\u2019s availability was limited because of health issues.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Moreover, there was ample <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>evidence presented that, when father did engage in domestic violence services, he continually asserted that the services were unnecessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-4\">3. <em>Father\u2019s visitation and parenting skills</em></p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">The state put on evidence that father\u2019s engagement in visitation and parenting classes was limited in the early stages of the case. As previously noted, father missed three consecutive visits with all six children, and his visits were canceled in July 2014; he did not seek to resume those visits until the change of the permanency plan in December 2014, and his visits did not actually resume until late January 2015.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-6\">Father, however, offered evidence that, after reuniting with mother and seeking to resume visitation in late 2014, he then made an effort to engage in a parenting class along with mother. Father contacted Family Building Blocks, a service provider, and the family worked with a visitation coach, Ruks, from April through July 2015. Although father wanted to continue working with Ruks, DHS believed that the family would be better served by a different parenting class, and the family did not engage with their next parenting coach, Crank, until September 18, shortly before the termination trial resumed.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b519-7\">The reports from the parents\u2019 visits, as recounted at trial, present a mixed picture. Tavernier, a DHS caseworker who observed but did not directly supervise the visits, testified that father \u201cdoes not intervene when the children are\u2014I shouldn\u2019t say doesn\u2019t\u2014occasionally intervenes when children are doing something unsafe,\u201d and that \u201ca lot of the unsafe behaviors are laughed about or almost encouraged by that.\u201d She testified that she \u201chad definite concerns observing the visits\u201d in light of \u201can overall lack of consistency in follow-through with managing behaviors that the children <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>have exhibited. I\u2019ve seen a lot of laughing off negative behavior between Mom and Dad, thinking it was really funny and cute.\u201d As an example, she testified that the children were \u201cwalking on chairs that were unstable, that were not safe for them and either\u2014neither parent said a word, addressed it at all, or several times later they would say\u2014they would be told things like, \u2018Be careful,\u2019 but were not asked to sit down or get off of the chairs inappropriately.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b520-4\">DHS workers also referred to an incident during a visit in which father took all three of his boys to the bathroom. While father was assisting EJ on the toilet, EM pushed X to the ground and then tried to kick X. Father became angry and said, \u201cBoy, you\u2019ll get your butt tore up for that,\u201d and directed EM to stand in the corner.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">The parenting coaches who worked with the family, on the other hand, both testified that they had no concerns about the safety of the children during the visits, and that the parents were receptive to feedback. Ruks, who observed five sessions, testified that father \u201c[absolutely\u201d seemed to want to \u201cengage with the children, get down on their level and that kind of thing,\u201d and that he was \u201creceptive to any feedback\u201d that Ruks gave him, \u201cdespite [father\u2019s] claim to the contrary at beginning that he wouldn\u2019t be.\u201d Ruks testified that, during her sessions, the parents \u201cseem[ed] to recognize that they needed [the typical supervision required for three-year-olds] and supervise them adequately.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b520-6\">Crank, who had only been present at two visits with the children by the time of trial, likewise testified that she saw \u201c[n]othing that had a safety concern to [her]\u201d and that she does \u201ca lot of visits, and often they\u2019re like this [somewhat hectic and chaotic]. But I mean, considering there\u2019s three toddlers and two adults in one room, I wouldn\u2019t say it was overly crazy.\u201d Crank testified that, although she had only seen two visits, she did not see anything that would prevent moving to visitation in the home or community. She stated, \u201cI think if they were supervised in the home, just to provide support, because visits\u2014children\u2019s behavior can change when it comes into the home. As long as they\u2019re supervised in the home\u2014I mean, so far I haven\u2019t seen anything, but it\u2019s only been two.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b521-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>Crank, too, was present for the incident in which father took EM, E J, and X into the bathroom and ultimately threatened to spank EM. Following the visit, Crank spoke with father \u201cabout the situation in the bathroom and that threatening to spank\u2019s not an appropriate way to discipline, and we discussed discipline techniques.\u201d Father responded that he \u201cbelieves that spankings are a reasonable way to discipline children.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b521-3\">4. <em>Father\u2019s housing</em></p>\n<p id=\"b521-4\">The parties also put on evidence regarding mother and father\u2019s current living situation. At the time of the trial, mother and father had found a home that was small but clean and well kept, and they had been living there for several months. Because of the way that the house is divided, there is a lack of visibility between rooms. Tavernier testified that her \u201cbiggest concern is the lack of visibility to those other rooms that the children would be living in,\u201d given their behavioral problems. Mother and father were subleasing part of the home to cover their rent, but the renters understood that they would be required to move out in the event that the children were returned to mother and father.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">5. <em>Children\u2019s circumstances and needs</em></p>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">a. E J and EM</p>\n<p id=\"b521-7\">EJ had the most difficulty with the transition to foster care and was rocking, banging his head against the wall, screaming when being read to, and generally exhibiting signs of stress. Those behaviors decreased over time, but the foster mother testified that the behaviors resurfaced in February 2015 when the visits with parents increased. E J has significant ongoing health issues that include severe asthma, which is controlled by daily use of a steroid inhaler; vision issues requiring surgery and follow-up visits; and frequent ear infections. He receives support from Willamette Education Service District (WESD) two to five times per month to address behaviors and processing deficiencies, and he receives support for speech needs.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-8\">EM likewise had difficulty with the transition to foster care and showed the same behaviors as EJ. EM\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>behaviors disappeared about five months into foster care. He, like his twin, has significant ongoing health issues, including severe asthma that is controlled by a daily steroid inhaler; vision issues requiring surgery and follow-up visits; and frequent ear infections. He, too, receives support from WESD two to five times per month to address behaviors and processing deficiencies, and he likewise receives support for speech needs.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-4\">With regard to EM\u2019s and E J\u2019s need for supervision, their foster mother described them needing a \u201chands on\u201d approach for very difficult behaviors, and the director at the children\u2019s daycare testified that they require one-on-one attention almost all day. However, Ruks, who had observed five sessions, testified that \u201cthe three-year-olds, they do need constant supervision. But I did not see them as out of control; they seemed very typical for what I experience with three year-olds.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">b. X</p>\n<p id=\"b522-6\">X was originally diagnosed with failure to thrive, but he began to thrive after being hospitalized. He has a positive attachment with his foster mother, who has cared for him nearly his entire life. X does not have any developmental delays, and he has not demonstrated the same degree of behavioral problems as EM and EJ. He, like his brothers, suffers from asthma and ear infections.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-7\">c. Father\u2019s awareness of children\u2019s needs</p>\n<p id=\"b522-8\">Father was asked at trial whether he was \u201caware of any special needs\u201d that any of his three children have. Father answered, \u201cNo,\u201d but his counsel later attempted to clarify whether father would accept WESD\u2019s evaluation of what issues the kids need help with. He responded, \u201cYes. I\u2019d definitely help with that.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b522-9\">6. <em>Trial court ruling</em></p>\n<p id=\"b522-10\">The trial court, in a detailed opinion, found that the state proved the following bases for termination: that father has failed to present a viable plan for the return of the children to father\u2019s care; that father has failed to learn or assume parenting and housekeeping skills sufficient to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>provide a safe and stable home for raising the children; that father has an emotional illness, mental illness, or mental deficiency of such nature and duration as to render the parent incapable of providing care for extended periods of time; that father has physically or emotionally neglected the children; and that father has failed to effect a lasting adjustment after reasonable efforts by available social agencies for such extended duration of time that it appears reasonable that no lasting adjustment can be effected.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b523-3\">The trial court explained that father was not able to address his own needs, let alone those of his children, and that his children had developed primary attachments to their foster parents. The court further explained that EM, E J, and X have \u201csignificant medical and educational needs that the parents have only recently acknowledged and are not yet prepared to address,\u201d and that both parents \u201creadily blame DHS for the situation their family is in, but take no personal responsibility for the children coming into care or waiting in foster care for over two years for the parents to engage in services and make the changes necessary for the children to return home.\u201d The court stated that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-4\">\u201cfather denies that he needs the services that have been recommended. He does not believe he needs domestic violence counseling and failed to engage in individual counseling until after the trial had started. Father does not recognize how his aggressive parenting negatively affects his children and how that will only be exacerbated if their attachments to their primary caregivers, the foster parents, are severed. While father did not follow through with his threat to tear up [EM\u2019s] \u2018butt\u2019 (while under the supervision of DHS), it is the type of behavior he testified he thought it would be appropriate to spank an older child for. Aggressive parenting is the absolute opposite type of parenting the experts testified these children need and would likely harm the children\u2019s social and emotional wellbeing.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b524-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b524-4\">Father now appeals the termination judgment, arguing that the state failed to prove that he is presently unfit. According to father, DHS seeks to terminate his parental rights based on allegations that \u201csnowballed from his hostility towards the department after his children were removed for a reason <em>[i.e., </em>child abuse] later determined to be unfounded.\u201d DHS, in response, reprises its argument that, considering the totality of the circumstances, father is presently unfit and reintegration into father\u2019s home is not possible within a reasonable time.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">A. <em>Legal Standard for Termination</em></p>\n<p id=\"b524-6\">To terminate a parent\u2019s rights on the basis of unfitness, a court must find that (1) the parent has engaged in conduct or is characterized by a condition that is seriously detrimental to the child; (2) integration of the child into the parent\u2019s care is improbable within a reasonable time due to conduct or conditions not likely to change; and (3) termination is in the best interests of the child. ORS 419B.500; ORS 419B.504; <em>State ex rel SOSCF v. Stillman, </em>333 Or 135, 145-46, 36 P3d 490 (2001). The state must establish the statutory grounds for termination by clear and convincing evidence. ORS 419B.521(1). Evidence is clear and convincing when it makes the existence of a fact \u201chighly probable.\u201d <em>State ex rel Dept. of Human Services v. Smith, </em>338 Or 58, 79, 106 P3d 627 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b524-7\">In considering whether a parent\u2019s conduct or condition is \u201cseriously detrimental,\u201d the court focuses on the detrimental effect of the parent\u2019s conduct or condition <em>on the child, </em>\u201cnot just the seriousness of the parent\u2019s conduct or condition in the abstract.\u201d <em>Stillman, </em>333 Or at 146. That said, a condition or conduct can be \u201cseriously detrimental\u201d based on the potential for such harm. <em>Dept. of Human Services v. R. K., </em>271 Or App 83, 88, 251 P3d 68, <em>rev den, </em>357 Or 640 (2015). In each case, the \u201cserious detriment\u201d inquiry is \u201cchild-specific\u201d and calls for testimony regarding the needs of the particular child. <em>State ex rel Dept. of Human Services v. Huston, </em>203 Or App 640, 657, 126 P3d 710 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b525-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>Moreover, unfitness \u201cmust exist at the time of the termination hearing; past unfitness is insufficient.\u201d <em>R. K, </em>271 Or App at 89. In determining whether DHS has proved unfitness, we examine the parent\u2019s conduct and conditions in combination rather than in isolation. <em>See State ex rel Dept. of Human Services v. B. S. I., </em>219 Or App 158, 175, 182 P3d 230, <em>rev den, </em>344 Or 670 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b525-4\">B. <em>DHS Allegations Against Father</em></p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">1. <em>Father\u2019s emotional illness, mental illness, or mental deficiency</em></p>\n<p id=\"b525-7\">Much of DHS\u2019s case for termination is based on the specter of physical and psychological abuse by father\u2014both against his children and against mother. As father points out, DHS initially believed that father had abused EJ and EM, which turned out to be unfounded, and it then believed that he had abused mother\u2019s older children based on their reports. DHS, however, has never proceeded on an allegation that father physically abused children, and it failed to present more than speculation that father had ever engaged in domestic violence, let alone exposed the children to domestic violence.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b525-8\">Instead, DHS proceeded more generally on an allegation that father has an \u201cemotional illness, mental illness, or mental deficiency of such nature and duration as to render the parent incapable of providing care for extended periods of time.\u201d As that allegation suggests, to terminate his parental rights, DHS must prove more than the fact that father has difficulty managing anger and anxiety, struggles with an antisocial personality disorder, or will resort to the use of physical violence against other adults. DHS must also prove the requisite nexus to father\u2019s <em>parenting\u2014i.e., </em>that any of his mental or emotional problems have rendered him \u201cincapable\u201d of providing care for his children for extended periods of time or been seriously detrimental to the children.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-9\">To prove that nexus, DHS must do more than rely on the fact that father has engaged in certain conduct or has certain conditions; DHS must present child-specific <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>evidence to demonstrate that father\u2019s emotional illness, mental illness, or mental deficiencies are seriously detrimental to EJ, EM, and X. <em>Huston, </em>203 Or App at 657; <em>see also Dept. of Human Services v. A. M. C., </em>245 Or App 81, 89, 260 P3d 821 (2011) (\u201cUnspecified detriment that we can only discern because the evidence of conduct or condition \u2018speaks for itself,\u2019 is a far cry from actual, clear, and convincing evidence that proves serious detriment.\u201d); <em>see also State ex rel Dept. of Human Services v. Simmons, </em>342 Or 76, 100, 149 P3d 1124 (2006) (a personality disorder is a \u201ccondition\u201d of the kind that may justify termination under ORS 419B.504, if there is clear and convincing evidence that that condition is seriously detrimental to child).</p>\n<p id=\"b526-4\">In this case, DHS has failed to prove the required nexus. First, DHS has not presented clear and convincing evidence that father\u2019s mental health or emotional problems, or his tendency to resort to violence, have ever manifested in domestic violence or in the type of harm or risk of harm to the children that justifies termination of parental rights. The only incidents of violence in father\u2019s past, on this record, appear to have involved adult males\u2014e.g., bar fights, street fights, and the incident involving a person who approached him near the park\u2014and there is scant evidence of the actual frequency that such incidents had occurred over the past decade, or that father was actually modeling violent behavior in front of his children. Nor did DHS offer evidence of how father\u2019s past violence against nonfamily adults, such as the incident near the park, had affected the children.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">Second, DHS failed to prove that father\u2019s mental or emotional health has resulted or will result in physical discipline that is seriously detrimental to his children. Although DHS, and some of its witnesses at trial, characterized father\u2019s discipline as \u201cabuse,\u201d DHS has not proceeded on that theory, and we are not persuaded that there is clear and convincing evidence that father\u2019s discipline ever crossed over the line to physical abuse.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Nonetheless, the question <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>remains whether father\u2019s \u201caggressive parenting\u201d\u2014as a product of his personality disorder or mental and emotional health\u2014might nevertheless be seriously detrimental to the children, given their particular needs.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-4\">Although the trial court found that \u201c [a] ggressive parenting is the absolute opposite type of parenting the experts testified these children need and would likely harm the children\u2019s social and emotional wellbeing,\u201d the record simply lacks clear and convincing evidence that any such harm would be the type of <em>seriously detrimental </em>effect required for termination. The mental health experts who testified about the needs of EM, E J, and X did not testify about the seriously detrimental effect that physical discipline would have on those children, and the record does not include evidence from which we could infer that spankings\u2014even if not a preferred method of parenting these children\u2014affects them so differently than the \u201cmany thousands of children [who] are being raised under basically the same circumstances\u201d in Oregon. <em>State v. McMaster, </em>259 Or 291, 304, 486 P2d 576 (1971);<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>State ex rel Dept. of Human Services v. Shugars, </em>208 Or App 694, 717, 145 P3d 366 (2006) (\u201cParents\u2019 failure to do so may fall short of what would be expected of model parents, but that is not the standard.\u201d). In short, the record lacks highly persuasive and child-specific evidence that father\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>use of physical discipline would be seriously detrimental to EM, E J, and X.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-3\">For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that DHS failed to prove its allegation that father\u2019s emotional illness, mental illness, or mental deficiency provides a basis on which to terminate father\u2019s parental rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-4\">2. <em>Father\u2019s failure to learn or assume parenting skills</em></p>\n<p id=\"b528-5\">DHS also alleged, and the trial court found, that father failed to learn or assume parenting and housekeeping skills sufficient to provide a safe and stable home for raising the children. As we understand DHS\u2019s case, that allegation relates predominantly to father\u2019s resort to physical discipline. DHS points to the incident in the bathroom, which, according to DHS, \u201cillustrates father\u2019s lack of parenting skills in three ways.\u201d First, father was \u201cunable to maintain control of the boys despite being alone with them for only 10 minutes of a 90 minute visit.\u201d Second, despite coaching as to why spanking was inappropriate, he continued to threaten it. And third, father \u201cfailed to learn that psychological damage can result from such threats and that it is not good parenting to model one behavior\u2014physical threats and spanking\u2014when expecting the children not to act out physically with each other.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b528-6\">As explained above, we are not persuaded, on <em>de novo </em>review, that father\u2019s use of physical discipline\u2014even if not preferred parenting\u2014presents a condition that is seriously detrimental to EM, EJ, and X. Nor is the incident, by itself or in combination with other evidence, a sufficient basis for termination. The testimony regarding father\u2019s ability to parent his children safely during visits was mixed; although there was testimony from DHS that father allowed children to walk on unstable chairs and was unable to manage their behaviors, the parenting coaches testified that they were not concerned about safety. In any event, the record lacks clear and convincing evidence that father\u2019s lack of parenting or housekeeping skills, as demonstrated during the visits, posed the type of harm to the children that would justify terminating his parental rights. That is, even assuming that father\u2019s lack of parenting or housekeeping skills might be harmful to his children, DHS has not proved the \u201cmore <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>serious and uncommon\u201d detriment that is required to terminate parental rights. <em>McMaster, </em>259 Or at 303; <em>Smith, </em>338 Or at 87 (noting that, although the \u201cevidence of mother\u2019s conduct during visitations did not flatter her,\u201d the child was never injured or in any danger during her visits; and explaining that, although \u201cperfection in parenting\u201d was not attainable for mother, \u201cneither is it required\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b529-4\">3. <em>Father\u2019s physical and emotional neglect</em></p>\n<p id=\"b529-5\">The trial court also found that father was unfit on the basis of physical and emotional neglect. Again, we are not persuaded that father\u2019s conduct\u2014although less than preferable\u2014rises to the level required for termination of his parental rights, particularly when viewed as of the time of the termination trial. Father had been visiting his children and making efforts to work with parenting coaches from March 2015 through the termination trial. And, as DHS acknowledges, there is a question in the record as to how much father and mother were actually notified of the children\u2019s medical appointments; in light of that uncertainty, and given father\u2019s other efforts with regard to visiting his children, we are not persuaded that any past emotional and physical neglect rendered father unfit at the time of the hearing. <em>See Smith, </em>338 Or at 83 (\u201c[T]o support termination under ORS 419B.504, the condition had to render the parent unfit <em>at the time of the termination </em>hearing.\u201d (Emphasis in original.)).</p>\n<p id=\"b529-6\">4. <em>Father\u2019s lack of a viable plan</em></p>\n<p id=\"b529-7\">DHS next argues that father failed to present a viable plan for the return of the children to his care. According to DHS, father has no plan to meet\u2014and has barely acknowledged\u2014the special needs of his children, and he still lacks housing that is \u201cappropriate for parenting the children.\u201d Father, on the other hand, argues that he \u201chad a home that even department workers deemed safe,\u201d that father could continue his counseling \u201cunder the watchful eye of the department while the boys are in his care,\u201d and that father\u2019s understanding of his children\u2019s needs must be considered in light of how little parents were included in any medical appointments.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>First, we are not persuaded by DHS\u2019s argument regarding father\u2019s current housing. The evidence in the record suggests that father\u2019s current housing would be minimally adequate to parent his children, and the concerns about \u201cvisibility\u201d in the home do not persuade us that it cannot be made safe for young children.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-4\">Second, we are not persuaded that father\u2019s lack of a plan to meet the children\u2019s medical and educational needs is a sufficient basis on which to terminate his parental rights. Although father demonstrated a limited understanding of his children\u2019s medical needs, DHS did not prove that those needs, while significant, are beyond father\u2019s ability to monitor with assistance from DHS and medical providers.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-5\">Likewise, father was slow to recognize his children\u2019s educational and developmental needs, but he articulated a willingness to rely on agencies like WESD to assess the children\u2019s needs and to work with those agencies, and DHS did not present clear and convincing evidence to persuade us otherwise.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b530-6\">For those reasons, and in light of the other circumstances of this case, including DHS\u2019s failure to prove that father\u2019s mental and emotional health and parenting skills are seriously detrimental to the children,'we are not persuaded that father is unfit based on his failure to present a viable plan for the return of the children.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-7\">5. <em>Father\u2019s failure to effect a lasting adjustment</em></p>\n<p id=\"b530-8\">Finally, we are not persuaded that father\u2019s failure to make a \u201clasting adjustment\u201d is itself a basis on which to terminate father\u2019s parental rights. Father failed to engage in all of the services that were required by DHS, and that failure has delayed possible reunification. However, given the particular circumstances of this case, including DHS\u2019s failure to prove that father\u2019s mental and emotional health, parenting skills, and housing situation\u2014the underlying conditions that father was asked to adjust\u2014were seriously detrimental to the children at the time of trial, we are not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>persuaded that the delay occasioned by the lack of adjustment in those areas has been seriously detrimental to the children or that father\u2019s lack of cooperation with DHS should effectively serve as an independent basis on which to terminate his rights at the present time. <em>Cf. State ex rel Dept. of Human Services v. Rodgers, </em>204 Or App 198, 221, 129 P3d 243 (2006) (\u201c [F] ather\u2019s hostility toward DHS was part of a general refusal to participate in services that would have been an essential part of establishing that it was safe to return child to father\u2019s care.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b531-4\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b531-5\">In sum, we agree with father that DHS has not proved by clear and convincing evidence that he is presently unfit for the reasons alleged in the termination petition. Accordingly, we reverse and remand the termination judgments.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b531-6\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b512-9\"> Mother\u2019s parental rights to EM, EJ, and X, as well as her parental rights to three children from a previous relationship, A, EB, and G, are the subject of a separate case, also decided this date. <em>Dept. of Human Services v.

DHS presented evidence that it was trying to get mother and father into a Parenting Connections class rather than therapeutic visitations, and that mother and father declined to participate in that class.

DHS does not address those allegations, and we do not discuss them further.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b525-10\"> As noted, the trial court concluded that DHS had not proved the allegation that father had exposed the children to domestic violence. 282 Or App at 501 n 6.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b526-6\"> Although the word \u201cabuse\u201d was sometimes used by DHS workers to characterize father\u2019s resort to physical discipline, we would be required to speculate on this record that father\u2019s use of spanking the children was of a degree or nature sufficient to constitute physical abuse. <em>Cf.

However, we and the Supreme Court have continued to rely on the <em>McMaster </em>formulation of whether the relevant conduct or condition is \u201cseriously detrimental.\u201d <em>See Smith, </em>338 Or at 87-88 (quoting <em>McMaster, </em>259 Or at 302-03, for the proposition that, \u201cunder previous version of statute, when legislature used phrase \u2018seriously detrimental to the child\u2019 it had \u2018in mind a more serious and uncommon detriment\u2019 than that caused by the parents\u2019 inability \u2018to furnish surroundings that would enable child to grow up as we would desire all children to do\u2019\u201d); <em>Stillman, </em>333 Or at 152 (\u201c[A]s in <em>McMaster, </em>we do not think that the level of anxiety that the children have experienced here is the sort of serious detriment that the legislature contemplated as providing the basis for a conclusion that a parent is unfit.\u201d); <em>State ex rel Dept. of Human Services v.
