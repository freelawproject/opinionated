(Apogee) negligently caused the death of his father, Jack Sloan. Plaintiff appeals the judgment entered against him after the jury found Apogee negligent, but did not find Apogee\u2019s negligence to be the cause of Sloan\u2019s death.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Plaintiff argues that the trial court erred in failing to give two of plaintiffs requested jury instructions. Plaintiff also assigns error to the denial of his motion for a new trial. Because we conclude that the trial court erred in failing to provide one of the proposed instructions, we reverse and remand with respect to plaintiffs claim against Apogee.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">I. STANDARD OF REVIEW AND STATEMENT OF FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b325-6\">In reviewing whether the trial court erred in failing to give the requested instructions, we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the establishment of the facts necessary to require the giving of those instructions. <em>Hernandez v. Barbo Machinery Co., </em>327 Or 99, 101 n 1, 957 P2d 147 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b325-7\">On November 3, 2007, at about 3:00 a.m., Sloan, then 85 years old, fell in his bathroom after having blacked out for a moment. Sloan took a cab to the emergency room of a hospital, owned and operated by Providence, to receive treatment. He explained to the medical personnel that he had fallen and was experiencing chest pain and pain in what the medical personnel described as Sloan\u2019s \u201cright flank\u201d area, on the right side of Sloan\u2019s back, below his rib cage and above his hip bone. The emergency room medical personnel determined that Sloan had atrial fibrillation and began treating that condition. An x-ray was taken of Sloan\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>chest with a portable x-ray machine, and both the radiologist and the emergency room doctor found no rib fractures on the x-ray image. However, at trial, plaintiffs medical experts testified that the portable x-ray image showed, albeit subtly, that Sloan had at least one, and maybe five, displaced rib fractures, as well as some fluid in his right chest cavity.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-4\">Sloan was admitted to the hospital and treated for atrial fibrillation, anemia, and risk of stroke by Doctors Jasti and Naoom, both of whom were hospitalists<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> employed by Apogee to work in Providence\u2019s hospital. Sloan\u2019s blood levels dropped significantly during his stay at the hospital, and the hospitalists treated the drop in Sloan\u2019s blood levels with a transfusion of two liters of blood, and performed an endoscopy and colonoscopy to determine the source of blood loss. The tests did not show the source of Sloan\u2019s blood loss, and the hospitalists ordered no further tests to determine the source of the problem.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">Throughout Sloan\u2019s hospital stay, he complained of pain in his right flank area. Other than giving pain medication, the hospitalists did not diagnose or treat Sloan\u2019s complaint of pain. Sloan often needed oxygen for breathing, and nurses reported diminished sounds in both lobes of Sloan\u2019s lungs. Plaintiffs medical experts testified that Sloan\u2019s blood loss, complaints of \u201cright flank\u201d pain, his need for oxygen, and the nurses\u2019 reports of diminished sounds in the lobes of the lungs, all indicated that Sloan had rib fractures and bleeding in his chest cavity. The medical experts further testified that other diagnostic imaging equipment available at the hospital would have given the hospitalists a much sharper and more reliable image of Sloan\u2019s chest than the portable x-ray image taken in the emergency room. The hospitalists, however, did not order any further diagnostic imaging.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-6\">On November 7, the hospitalists discharged Sloan to a skilled nursing facility, Avamere Three Fountains (Three Fountains), where medical personnel understood from the hospital records that Sloan was at risk of syncope, or loss <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>of consciousness, was anemic with the cause unknown, had high blood pressure and atrial fibrillation, and was \u201cgenerally deconditioned\u201d from having been in a hospital bed for several days. Sloan remained at Three Fountains until November 19. He was able to breathe, supported, on and off, by two liters of oxygen per minute, until the morning of November 17, when Sloan\u2019s oxygen saturation levels decreased to 70 percent. By November 19, with the support of four liters of oxygen per minute, Sloan\u2019s oxygen saturation levels had declined to 58 percent and his breathing was shallow and irregular. Three Fountains sent Sloan to the emergency room for treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-4\">A chest x-ray taken at the emergency room on November 19 indicated that Sloan had a hemothorax, which is an accumulation of blood in the lung cavity. The emergency room doctor drained approximately 1100 milliliters of bloody fluid from the lung cavity, and a second x-ray on that day showed that Sloan\u2019s right lung had collapsed from a hemothorax, that Sloan had three to five displaced rib fractures, and that at least two of those rib fractures had caused bleeding into the chest cavity. Sloan died shortly thereafter.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">After an autopsy, the medical examiner determined that the cause of Sloan\u2019s death was \u201crespiratory failure due to right hemothorax, which is blood in the chest cavity, and right lung collapse due to multiple rib fractures due to a domestic fall.\u201d Dr. Thorson, who treated Sloan on November 19 in the emergency room, testified at trial that the same rib fractures that existed on November 3 were likely the cause of the hemothorax on November 19.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">At trial, plaintiffs theory of liability was that Sloan came to the hospital with rib fractures and bleeding in his chest cavity, which Providence\u2019s medical personnel and Apogee\u2019s hospitalists were negligent in failing to diagnose and treat, and that their failure caused Sloan\u2019s death. Pertinent to this appeal, plaintiff alleged in his fourth amended complaint that Apogee was negligent \u201cin one or more\u201d of the following particulars:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-7\">\u201c(a) In failing to ascertain the presence of multiple rib fractures;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>\u201c(b) In failing <em>to </em>recommend or order or obtain additional imaging studies to adequately rule in or rule out the presence of multiple rib fractures;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-4\"><em>\u201c(c) </em>In failing to treat Mr. Sloan for multiple rib fractures;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-5\">\u201c(d) In failing to ascertain the likely source of blood loss during Mr. Sloan\u2019s hospitalization;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-6\">\u201c(e) In discharging Mr. Sloan without ascertaining the likely source of bleeding;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-7\">\u201c(f) In assuming that Mr. Sloan suffered only a bruise on his right flank from his fall.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b328-8\">Apogee\u2019s main theory of defense was that \u201csomething happened\u201d to Sloan, beginning November 17, while Sloan was in Three Fountains\u2019 care. That unknown event, Apogee argued, caused Sloan\u2019s death. To support its theory, Apogee offered evidence that when Sloan left Apogee\u2019s care, Sloan had no displaced rib fractures and no bleeding in his chest cavity and that, upon arriving at Three Fountains, Sloan could breathe at normal rates without supplemental oxygen, had clear breath sounds in his lungs, had no cough or shortness of breath, and denied any chest pain. As evidence of a dramatic change, Apogee pointed to Sloan\u2019s reduced oxygen saturation levels starting on November 17 when Sloan was at Three Fountains, and the November 19 x-ray, showing that Sloan had three displaced fractures, two of which caused bleeding into the chest cavity.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-9\">Although Apogee acknowledged that no one knew what happened at Three Fountains, Apogee proffered evidence of certain possibilities. For example, with regard to the rib fractures, Apogee\u2019s medical expert, Kozak, testified, \u201cI don\u2019t know what happened with the patient between, just in the course of breathing, rolling around, getting in and out of bed, I mean, there\u2019s lots of things that can cause fractures to displace.\u201d Apogee also introduced evidence that Sloan had complained of dizziness at Three Fountains, which made him a high fall risk, and that Three Fountains had listed Sloan as ambulatory \u201cwith standby assistance,\u201d meaning that someone was to stand by Sloan for assistance in case he started to fall. Nevertheless, Sloan had decided against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>having side rails on his bed, and was found to have walked to the bathroom and sat on the side of his bed unassisted. Notations in Sloan\u2019s chart stated he \u201ctended to move quickly\u201d and was impulsive with \u201cdecreased safety awareness.\u201d A patient chart note of November 15 stated that Sloan was \u201cwilling and eager to work with therapy, wants more activity out of bed,\u201d but also noted that Sloan needed some assistance to get up in bed, and required \u201csix minutes rest at edge of bed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b329-4\">Another of Apogee\u2019s medical experts, Dobson, testified that, although he believed there were multiple rib fractures on November 3, those fractures were not displaced, meaning they were only cracked, and some had started to heal. Dobson explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-5\">\u201cAnd I think what happens is this man got up and he went to his physical therapy *** for example, he\u2019s eager to do that. At some point something happened. Something happened to cause *** [displacement and disruption *** that hit the blood vessels and he bled sometime after the 15th. And he bled filling up two to two and a half liters of fluid in to his lungs.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-6\">\u201cAnd by the 17th it\u2019s absolutely manifested by the man for no other explainable reason, dropping his oxygen saturation, having respiratory shallowness, and rapid breathing.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b329-7\">At the end of testimony by the Three Fountains physician, Dr. Brummer, the court asked Brummer the following question on behalf of a juror: \u201cCan an 85-year-old man suffer broken ribs if one or two assistants pulled or pushed or helped incorrectly to get him in or out of bed?\u201d Brummer answered, \u201cIf people with osteoporosis, thin bones, I mean, really thin bones, are lifted, even appropriately lifted, bones can spontaneously break. So, the answer to your question is yes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b329-8\">In closing arguments, Apogee\u2019s counsel argued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-9\">\u201cSo, the question then is what happened? How did this all come to pass under these particular circumstances? And I blame no one, quite frankly. But, he did go to the Three Fountains nursing facility. He was there. *** [Y] ou\u2019ll have the records with you to essentially see the gradual, but slow improvement and his level of activity and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>that sort of thing. And you\u2019ll see that suddenly something happened. *** [Something new and different just happened under-\u2014-under the circumstances at that time.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b330-4\">As relevant on appeal, plaintiff requested two instructions be given to the jury. The first, entitled \u201cLIABILITY FOR SUBSEQUENT CONDUCT OF THIRD PARTY\u201d (Conduct of Third Party Instruction), provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-5\">\u201cIf you find the defendant was negligent and that such negligence caused injury to the plaintiff, the defendant would also be liable for any additional injury caused by the subsequent conduct of another person or entity, even if such conduct was negligent or wrongful, as long as the subsequent conduct and risk of additional injury were reasonably foreseeable.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b330-6\">The second requested instruction, entitled \u201cLIABILITY FOR SUBSEQUENT CONDUCT OF ANOTHER\u201d (Conduct of Three Fountains Instruction), provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-7\">\u201cIf you find that [Apogee] was negligent and caused injury to decedent Jack Sloan, then [Apogee] is liable to plaintiff not only for those injuries, but is also liable for any additional injuries, including death, caused by [Three Fountains], even if the treatment provided by [Three Fountains] was negligent.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b330-8\">Plaintiff argued that those instructions were necessary, because Apogee had presented a theory that \u201cthe actionable event\u201d causing Sloan\u2019s death occurred when Sloan was in the care of Three Fountains, suggesting that things were getting worse at Three Fountains and that somebody at Three Fountains \u201cimplicitly dropped the ball[.]\u201d The requested jury instructions, plaintiff argued, indicated that Apogee could still be liable for Sloan\u2019s death, even if it was caused by Three Fountains\u2019 conduct.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Apogee responded that it was \u201cnot blaming anyone at Three Fountains.\u201d It further argued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-9\">\u201cI think that what we have is what historically has been thought of as intervening superseding cause. And if that\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>the kind of instruction that needs to be given then so be it. But, I don\u2019t think that the skilled nursing facility was treating anything that we caused or that we were responsible for.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b331-3\">\u201cAnd I don\u2019t\u2014I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a liability for a third-person in misconduct so much as it is a causation issue of a sequence of events that took place.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b331-4\">The trial court refused to give either instruction. Instead, the trial court gave the following instructions pertinent to this appeal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b331-5\">\u201cThe law assumes that all persons have obeyed the law and have been free from negligence. To recover the plaintiff must prove two things by a preponderance of the evidence. One, that the defendants were negligent in at least one of the ways claimed in the plaintiff\u2019s complaint. And, two, that the defendants\u2019 negligence was a cause of damage to the plaintiff.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b331-6\">\u00ab\u2021 \u2021 $ \u215c \u2021</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b331-7\">\u201cA person is liable only for the reasonably foreseeable consequences of his or her actions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b331-8\">\u201cThere are two things that must be foreseeable. First, the plaintiff must be within the general class of persons that one reasonably would anticipate might be threatened by the defendant\u2019s conduct. Second, the harm suffered must be within the general class of harms that one reasonably would anticipate might result from the defendant\u2019s conduct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b331-9\">\u201cA cause is defined as an act or omission that is a substantial factor in bringing about the harm. A substantial factor is an important or material factor and not one that is insignificant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b331-10\">\u201cMany factors or things may operate either independently or together to cause harm. In such a case each may be a cause of the harm, even though the others by themselves would have been sufficient to cause the same harm.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b331-11\">\u201cIf you find that the defendant\u2019s act or omission was a substantial factor in causing the harm to the plaintiff you may find that the defendant\u2019s conduct caused the harm, even though it was not the only cause.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>\u201cWhen there are two or more possible causes for an injury for one or more of which a defendant is not responsible there can be no recovery, unless it is shown that as between the causes in question the cause for which a defendant is responsible is the more probable.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-4\">\u201cIf the evidence leaves it as probable that the injury was a result of one cause as much as another, then the plaintiff cannot recover from that defendant.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">The jury found that Providence was not negligent. It found that Apogee\u2019s conduct was negligent, but not the cause of Sloan\u2019s death. After the jury\u2019s verdict, plaintiff moved for a new trial, arguing that the trial court erred in failing to include the Conduct of Third Party Instruction and the Conduct of Three Fountains Instruction in the jury instructions. Plaintiff argued that, without the requested instructions, the jury misunderstood the law regarding causation and, as a result, the jury found Apogee\u2019s conduct was negligent, but not the cause of Sloan\u2019s death. The trial court denied the motion. On appeal, plaintiff assigns error to the court\u2019s failure to provide those instructions and to the subsequent denial of his motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-6\">II. ANALYSIS OF PROPOSED JURY INSTRUCTIONS</p>\n<p id=\"b332-7\">\u201cA party is entitled to jury instructions consistent with her theory of the case, provided that the instructions (1) correctly state the law; (2) are based on the current pleadings; and (3) are supported by evidence.\u201d <em>Crismon v. Parks, </em>238 Or App 312, 314, 241 P3d 1200 (2010) (citing <em>Hernandez, </em>327 Or at 106) (other citations omitted). A trial court\u2019s error in failing to give a requested jury instruction does not require reversal unless the error \u201csubstantially affect [ed] the rights\u201d of the party requesting the instruction. ORS 19.415(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b332-8\">We agree with plaintiff that Apogee suggested to the jury that Three Fountains was responsible for Sloan\u2019s death and that Apogee offered evidence to support that theory. Consequently, we understand plaintiffs theory to be that if the jury were to find that Three Fountains caused Sloan\u2019s death, Apogee could still be liable if (1) Apogee\u2019s negligence caused Sloan to be discharged in a weakened and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>fragile state, with undiagnosed and untreated rib fractures and internal bleeding;<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and (2) Three Fountains caused the rib fractures to become further displaced, thereby causing Sloan\u2019s death, or Three Fountains failed to act when Sloan\u2019s condition from the rib fractures and internal bleeding worsened, thereby causing Sloan\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-4\">A. <em>Correct Statement of the Law</em></p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">Whether a defendant can be liable for injury caused by the conduct of a third party involves two issues. First, a plaintiff must establish that defendant\u2019s negligence was a cause in fact of the alleged injury. <em>See Towe v. Sacagawea, Inc., </em>357 Or 74, 87, 346 P3d 1207 (2015) (plaintiff must prove, as an element of a negligence claim, \u201ccause in fact\u201d). Second, where the issue is a defendant\u2019s liability for injury caused by a third party, case law includes a consideration of the \u201creasonable foreseeability\u201d of the injury caused by the third party. <em>See generally Fazzolari v. Portland School Dist. No. 1J, </em>303 Or 1, 11-22, 734 P2d 1326 (1987) (discussing role of foreseeability in negligence determinations); <em>see also Piazza v. Kellim, </em>360 Or 58, 81, 377 P3d 492 (2016) (in discussing a defendant\u2019s liability for a third party\u2019s criminal acts, stating \u201ca trier of fact must be able to find from concrete facts that a reasonable person in the position of the defendant reasonably would have foreseen that the person or location and circumstances posed a risk of criminal harm to persons such as the plaintiff\u2019); <em>Buchler v. Oregon Corrections Div., </em>316 Or 499, 516, 853 P2d 798 (1993) (concluding that the defendant was not liable for the plaintiffs injury, \u201cbecause it was not reasonably foreseeable that [the third party] posed a risk of harm to persons in plaintiffs\u2019 position\u201d); <em>Becker v. Barbur Blvd. Equipment Rentals, Inc., </em>81 Or App 648, 652-53, 726 P2d 967 (1986), <em>adh\u2019d to as modified on recons, </em>84 Or App 367, 733 P2d 900, <em>rev den, </em>303 Or 535 (1987) (concluding that the \u201cdefendants ought reasonably to have foreseen\u201d that, through their negligence, the plaintiff could be injured by a third party).</p>\n<p id=\"b334-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>The principle of \u201cforeseeability\u201d is part of any negligence claim.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>See Lasley v. Combined Transport, Inc., </em>351 Or 1, 7, 261 P3d 1215 (2011) (\u201cWhen a defendant\u2019s negligence is a factual cause of harm to the plaintiff, the defendant is subject to liability to the plaintiff as long as the harm that the plaintiff suffered was a reasonably foreseeable result of the defendant\u2019s negligence.\u201d); <em>see also Towe, </em>357 Or at-87 (\u201cConceptually, foreseeability and causation are separate elements.\u201d); <em>see also Horton v. OHSU, </em>277 Or App 821, 823, 373 P3d 1158 (2016) (\u201cOn the pleaded facts, a reasonable factfinder could determine that the harms to plaintiffs were among the foreseeable risks of defendants\u2019 negligent surgery * * * and, further, that the negligent surgery was a cause in fact of plaintiffs\u2019 harm.\u201d). \u201c\u2018Foreseeability\u2019 acts as a limitation on liability and reflects societal judgment regarding the extent to which a defendant can be considered to be at fault for a plaintiffs harm.\u201d <em>Horton, </em>277 Or App at 832. In sum, because a third party was involved in this case, a resolution of the question of whether Apogee \u201ccaused\u201d Sloan\u2019s death requires evidence of the cause-in-fact of the injury, as well as evidence of the reasonable forseeability of the injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-4\">Plaintiffs Conduct of Three Fountains Instruction was incorrect, because it failed to explain that additional injuries caused by Three Fountains must be reasonably foreseeable injuries of Apogee\u2019s negligence. It was, therefore, not a correct statement of the law, because it was not complete and accurate in all respects. <em>See Purdy v. Deere and Company, </em>281 Or App 407, 419, 386 P3d 2 (2016) (\u201cA jury instruction must be both (1) complete and (2) accurate.\u201d). The trial court did not err in failing to give the Conduct of Three Fountains Instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>We reach a different conclusion with respect to plaintiffs Conduct of Third Party Instruction. The Conduct of Third Party Instruction speaks to both cause-in-fact and foreseeability. The instruction states that if the defendant negligently caused injury to the plaintiff, the defendant is liable for \u201cany additional injury\u201d caused by the \u201csubsequent conduct\u201d of a third party, if such harm-producing conduct and risk of additional injury was \u201creasonably foreseeable.\u201d Although the requested instruction does not specifically state that the \u201cadditional injury\u201d must be the consequence of the defendant\u2019s negligence, by describing the injury and conduct as \u201cadditional injury\u201d and \u201csubsequent conduct,\u201d the instruction can be understood to connect the first injury (fractured ribs and internal bleeding) to the second injury (Sloan\u2019s death) and the defendant\u2019s conduct to the third party\u2019s conduct. An \u201cadditional injury\u201d is an injury added to the original injury, and \u201csubsequent conduct\u201d connotes conduct occurring in conjunction with previous conduct. The Conduct of Third Party Instruction, therefore, indicates that a causal relationship must exist between Apogee\u2019s negligence and Sloan\u2019s death. Furthermore, the Conduct of Third Party Instruction was supported by the other jury instructions on causation, which instructed the jury that, in order for Apogee to be liable for Sloan\u2019s death, Apogee\u2019s act or omission must have been a \u201csubstantial factor\u201d in causing Sloan\u2019s death.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The requested instruction also addressed foreseeability, and correctly limited Apogee\u2019s liability to injury from third party conduct that was reasonably foreseeable.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-3\">Apogee remonstrates that the Conduct of Third Party Instruction is not correct in all aspects, because it does not follow the holding of <em>Martin v. Bohrer, </em>84 Or App 7, 733 P2d 68 (1987), <em>aff'd, </em>307 Or 144, 764 P2d 550 (1988). In <em>Martin, </em>the plaintiff sued the defendant for injuries sustained in a car accident. As part of discovery by the defendant, the plaintiff was examined by an independent medical examiner who, during the examination, allegedly injured the plaintiffs knee, which had not been injured in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>accident itself. 84 Or App at 9. In his complaint, the plaintiff alleged that the defendant was responsible for the knee injury. <em>Id. </em>The trial court struck the allegation, because the knee injury \u201cwas not sufficiently related to the original accident for defendant to be responsible for it.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b336-4\">The plaintiff in <em>Martin </em>argued that the trial court erred in striking the allegation, because, among other points, \u201can original tortfeasor may be held liable for <em>all </em>injuries which the victim suffers in the course of medical procedures undergone as a result of the original tort, rather than just those which arise out of the treatment of injuries caused by the tort.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis in original). The plaintiffs argument was based on a previous Supreme Court case, <em>Woosley v. Dunning, </em>268 Or 233, 520 P2d 340 (1974), in which the decedent and the defendant were in an automobile accident, and, in the course of undergoing medical tests from a neurosurgeon for vision problems allegedly caused by a head injury sustained in the automobile accident, the decedent suffered a brain stem hemorrhage and died. <em>Id. </em>at 237-38. The doctor who performed the medical tests testified at trial that the decedent\u2019s vision problems were \u201cdue to the head injury\u201d and that \u201cthere was a relationship between the [medical] tests [pertaining to the vision problems] and [the plaintiffs] death.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 238. The court concluded that the plaintiff \u201coffered sufficient evidence to make the question of causation a jury question,\u201d and stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-5\">\u201cIt has been previously held by this court, as well as by other courts, that one who negligently injures another person is liable for damages not only for the original injury, but also for all additional injury caused by a physician\u2019s treatment, even if negligent, so long as the treatment was provided in good faith effort to diagnose, cure or alleviate the original injury.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b336-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 251 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b336-7\">From that statement in <em>Woosley, </em>the plaintiff in <em>Martin </em>contended that the defendant\u2019s liability was not limited to injuries arising from the medical treatment of the injury caused by the original tortfeasor. Rather, the defendant\u2019s liability included any injuries arising during the course of medical treatment provided as a result of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>the original injury. <em>Martin, </em>84 Or App at 9. We disagreed with that broad interpretation of <em>Woosley, </em>noting that the Supreme Court in <em>Woosley </em>had limited the tortfeasor\u2019s liability to additional injury suffered from medical treatment that was \u201c\u2018provided in good faith effort to diagnose, cure or alleviate the <em>original injury.\u201d Id. </em>at 11 (quoting <em>Woosley, </em>268 Or at 251) (emphasis added in <em>Martin). </em>We held that \u201cthe better policy is a <em>per se </em>rule that the original tortfeasor\u2019s liability extends only to injuries that result from professional procedures directed at an injury which was caused or could have been understood by the physician to have been caused by the original injurious event.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 12. Applying that law to the plaintiffs allegation, we concluded that the allegation was \u201csufficient to permit plaintiff to attempt to prove that the knee injury resulted from the physician\u2019s attempts to diagnose, treat or evaluate the injuries which he sustained in the accident.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-4\">Apogee contends that <em>Martin's </em>holding limits Apogee\u2019s liability to \u201csubsequent harm [that arose] as a result of professional procedures undertaken by the subsequent care provider *** that were directed at an injury that [Three Fountains] understood to have been caused or could have been caused by the \u2018original injurious event\u2019 allegedly caused by Apogee.\u201d We disagree. Both <em>Woosley </em>and <em>Martin </em>stand for the principle that a defendant may be liable for injuries caused by a third party if the defendant\u2019s negligence was a \u201ccause in fact\u201d of the injury and the third party\u2019s conduct and the injury were reasonably foreseeable consequences of the defendant\u2019s negligence. In <em>Woosley, </em>the court concluded that there was evidence from which a jury could find a causal relationship between the automobile accident and the decedent\u2019s death. 268 Or at 252. Additionally, although the holding in <em>Woosley </em>does not speak in terms of the reasonable foreseeability of the subsequent treatment that caused the additional injury, it limits liability to subsequent conduct and injury that, under the principles set forth in <em>Fazzolari, </em>we would now call \u201creasonably foreseeable\u201d subsequent conduct and injury. Likewise, in <em>Martin, </em>we concluded that the allegations supported a causal connection between the automobile accident and the knee injury caused by the physician, and we limited liability consistent with case law that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>limits liability to the reasonably foreseeable consequences of a tortfeasor\u2019s negligence. We conclude that the Conduct of Third Party Instruction is consistent with those holdings and with other aforementioned case law pertaining to causation, and therefore, the instruction correctly stated the law applicable to plaintiffs theory of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-4\">B. <em>Based on Current Pleadings</em></p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">Apogee contends that the trial court did not err in refusing to give the instruction, because the fourth amended complaint does not support the instruction. Apogee argues that plaintiff did not allege \u201cthat Apogee caused a specific injury to [Sloan] and that [Sloan] later suffered additional injury caused by the conduct of Three Fountains.\u201d Although Apogee is correct that plaintiffs pleadings do not allege that Sloan suffered additional injury caused by Three Fountains, \u201cpleadings are the written statements by the parties of the facts constituting their respective claims and defenses.\u201d ORCP 13 A (emphasis added). \u201c[A] pleading for all practical and legal purposes is automatically amended whenever an issue not raised by the pleading is tried by consent.\u201d <em>Whinston v. Kaiser Foundation Hospital, </em>309 Or 350, 355, 788 P2d 428 (1990), <em>overruled on other grounds Shoup v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., </em>335 Or 164, 61 P3d 928 (2003) (footnotes omitted). As alleged by plaintiff, Sloan suffered multiple rib fractures and internal bleeding from his fall, which Apogee negligently failed to diagnose and treat. The parties subsequently tried by consent Apogee\u2019s defense that \u201csomething happened\u201d to Sloan at Three Fountains, which caused displaced rib fractures, causing bleeding into Sloan\u2019s chest cavity, which then resulted in Sloan\u2019s death. There was evidence from which one could infer that Sloan was in a weakened condition when he left the hospital, due to his undiagnosed and untreated rib fractures and the bleeding into the chest cavity, and that the already present rib fractures either became further displaced, causing Sloan\u2019s death, or the already present rib fractures and bleeding continued to worsen on their own, thereby causing Sloan\u2019s death. There was also evidence that \u201csomething happened\u201d at Three Fountains that worsened the already present rib fractures, or that Three Fountains failed to act soon enough when the rib fractures and internal bleeding worsened. Consequently, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>the pleadings supported the theory that Apogee caused an injury to Sloan at the time Sloan left the hospital, and supported the theory that Sloan suffered \u201cadditional injury\u201d at Three Fountains.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-3\">C. <em>Supported by the Evidence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b339-4\">Next, we consider whether the Conduct of Third Party Instruction was supported by the evidence. Considering the facts in the light most favorable to plaintiff\u2019s requested instruction, we conclude that it was. There was evidence from which the jury could find that Apogee was negligent in caring for Sloan and, as a result, failed to diagnose and treat Sloan\u2019s rib fractures, causing Sloan to leave the hospital in a weakened and fragile state with undiagnosed and untreated rib fractures and bleeding into his right chest cavity. There was evidence presented at trial that the same rib fractures that existed on November 3 were likely the cause of the hemothorax on November 19. There was evidence from which the jury could infer that something happened at Three Fountains that further injured Sloan\u2019s ribs, thereby causing Sloan\u2019s death, or that, had Three Fountains taken Sloan to the emergency room sooner, he would not have died. There was evidence, therefore, of a causal connection between Apogee\u2019s conduct and Sloan\u2019s death, as well as evidence that Sloan\u2019s death was a reasonably foreseeable consequence of Apogee\u2019s negligence. That evidence supported the Conduct of Third Party Instruction. We therefore conclude that the trial court erred in failing to give plaintiffs Conduct of Third Party instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">D. <em>Denial Substantially Affected Plaintiff s Rights</em></p>\n<p id=\"b339-6\">The trial court\u2019s error does not require reversal unless the error \u201csubstantially affect [ed] the rights\u201d of plaintiff. ORS 19.415(2). \u201cIn the context of instructional error, that standard will generally be met if, \u2018when the instructions are considered as a whole in light of the evidence and the parties\u2019 theories of the case at trial [,] there is some likelihood that the jury reached a legally erroneous result[.]\u2019\u201d <em>Dosanjh v. Namaste Indian Restaurant, LLC, </em>272 Or App 87, 92, 353 P3d 1243 (2015) (quoting <em>Purdy v. Deere and Company, </em>355 Or 204, 232, 324 P3d 455 (2014)); see <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number><em>also Purdy, </em>281 Or App at 430 (\u201cIf there is little likelihood\u2019 that an error affected the verdict, we may not reverse; if there is some likelihood or a significant likelihood that the error influenced the jury\u2019s verdict, we must reverse.\u201d). We conclude that that test has been met in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-3\">The Conduct of Third Party Instruction was necessary to avoid jury confusion in light of the evidence offered at trial and the parties\u2019 competing theories of the case. Plaintiffs theory was that Apogee\u2019s failure to diagnose and treat the rib fractures and the bleeding into the right chest cavity caused Sloan\u2019s death. Apogee\u2019s main defense was that the cause of Sloan\u2019s death was the care of a third party, Three Fountains, and, therefore, Apogee was not liable for Sloan\u2019s death. Given those theories, we. believe that the jury may have inaccurately understood that, if Sloan\u2019s death was \u201ccaused\u201d by Three Fountains, plaintiff could not recover from Apogee. <em>See Purdy, </em>355 Or at 225-27 (explaining circumstances under which the refusal to give a requested instruction may \u201csubstantially affect\u201d the rights of the party requesting the instruction). Furthermore, even though the jury was given general instructions pertaining to causation and foreseeability, the jury may have concluded that those instructions did not apply to Apogee if Three Fountains caused Sloan\u2019s death. Plaintiffs Conduct of Third Party Instruction fully covered what the general instructions on causation and foreseeability did not cover; it explained how Apogee could be liable for Sloan\u2019s death even if Three Fountains caused Sloan\u2019s death. <em>See Hernandez, </em>327 Or at 106 (no error in trial court\u2019s refusal to give a requested instruction if the requested instruction, though correct, \u201cwas covered fully by other jury instructions given by the trial court\u201d). The requested instruction would have explained to the jury that Apogee could be liable for injury caused by Three Fountains\u2019 conduct, if Apogee\u2019s negligence was a \u201ccause in fact\u201d of Sloan\u2019s death and if Sloan\u2019s death, because of the conduct of Three Fountains, was a reasonably foreseeable consequence of Apogee\u2019s negligence. We therefore conclude that the failure to give the Conduct of Third Party Instruction \u201csubstantially affect [ed]\u201d plaintiffs rights and that the trial court\u2019s refusal to give the instruction requires reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>As a final matter, we address plaintiffs request that a remand be limited to the issues of causation and damages. A \u201cnew trial in a personal-injury case ordinarily should be a new trial on all contested factual issues, regardless of the ability of the parties on appeal to pinpoint error so as to show that the error, if any, may have affected only one issue.\u201d <em>Maxwell v. Port. Terminal RR. Co., </em>253 Or 573, 577, 456 P2d 484 (1969). The court in <em>Maxwell </em>explained that there are exceptions to that rule:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-4\">\u201cThere will, of course, be exceptional cases in which the trial court, in the exercise of judicial discretion, properly will limit the issues for a new trial. But the standard to be applied in the exercise of this discretion is reasonable certainty that the issue or issues to be eliminated from the second trial are no longer viable issues in the case and that their removal will not prejudice the right of either party to the kind of jury trial to which he would have been entitled but for the error or errors necessitating the new trial.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b341-6\">We do not believe that this is an exceptional case for which the trial court has discretion to limit the retrial to the issues of causation and damages. The instructional error could have affected the jury\u2019s understanding of various issues concerning the case. <em>See Wilson v. B. F. Goodrich, </em>52 Or App 139, 152, 627 P2d 1280 (1981), <em>aff\u2019d, </em>292 Or 626, 642 P2d 644 (1982) (concluding that both liability and damages must be retried on remand of a personal injury claim, \u201csince the jury will hear evidence relevant to liability, [and] there is a significant possibility of prejudice to the defendant on the damages question if the jury is aware that that evidence has already been determined to establish liability\u201d). We therefore conclude that, on remand, retrial is not limited in the way that plaintiff requests.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-7\">Judgment for defendant Apogee reversed and remanded; otherwise affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b325-8\"> The jury found that Providence was not negligent, and plaintiff does not challenge that part of the judgment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b325-9\"> In light of our conclusion that the trial court erred in failing to give one of plaintiffs requested jury instruction and that that error requires remand for a new trial, we do not address plaintiff\u2019s assignment of error relating to the denial of his motion for a new trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b326-7\"> Jasti explained that hospitalists are in-house physicians at hospitals, who provide 24-hour care for patients.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b330-10\"> Apogee argues that plaintiff did not preserve the assignments of error pertaining to the two jury instructions, because plaintiff failed to except to the trial court\u2019s failure to give the requested instructions as required by ORCP 59 H.
