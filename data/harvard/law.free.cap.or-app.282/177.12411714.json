The trial court ordered that appellant be civilly committed on the grounds that appellant was: (1) dangerous to others; and (2) unable to meet his own basic health and safety needs. Appellant argues that the state failed to establish either ground by clear and convincing evidence. We agree, and reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">An involuntary civil commitment requires the state to prove, by clear and convincing evidence, that a person is mentally ill and that, because of the illness, the person is a danger to self, a danger to others, or unable to meet the person\u2019s own basic needs. <em>State v. D. L. </em>W., 244 Or App 401, 404, 260 P3d 691 (2011); <em>former </em>ORS 426.005(1)(e)(A), (B) (2013), <em>amended by </em>Or Laws 2015, ch 433, \u00a7 1, <em>renumbered as </em>ORS 426.005(1)(f)(A), (B) (2015). Whether the statutory criteria are met is determined by the appellant\u2019s condition at the time of the hearing as understood in the context of the appellant\u2019s history. <em>State v. M. R., 225 Or </em>App 569, 574, 202 P3d 221 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b200-6\">Appellant does not request that we review his case <em>de </em>novo, and we decline to do so. <em>See </em>ORS 19.415 (3)(b) (\u201c[T]he Court of Appeals, acting in its sole discretion, may try the cause anew upon the record or make one or more factual findings anew upon the record.\u201d); ORAP 5.40(8)(c) (\u201cThe Court of Appeals will exercise its discretion to try the cause anew on the record or to make one or more factual findings anew on the record only in exceptional cases.\u201d). Accordingly, we review the trial court\u2019s legal conclusions for errors of law but are bound by its findings of historical fact unless there is no evidence to support them. <em>State v. D. R., </em>239 Or App 576, 579, 244 P3d 916 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b200-7\">Where, as here, an appellant challenges the legal sufficiency of the evidence supporting the trial court\u2019s determination that the appellant was dangerous to himself, dangerous to others, or unable to meet his basic needs, the question for us is whether the trial court\u2019s determination <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>was permissible on the record before it. <em>State v. R. L. W., </em>267 Or App 725, 728, 341 P3d 845 (2014) (citing <em>Dept. of Human Services v. N. P., </em>257 Or App 633, 639-41, 307 P3d 444 (2013) (en banc)). Whether the evidence is legally sufficient to support a determination under ORS 426.005(1) that the appellant is dangerous or unable to meet his basic needs \u201cis a determination that we review as a matter of law.\u201d <em>State v. S. R. J., </em>281 Or App 741, 748-49, 386 P3d 99 (2016).</p>\n<p id=\"b201-3\">With those legal standards in mind, we state the facts \u201c\u2018consistently with the trial court\u2019s express and implied findings\u2019 as supplemented with uncontroverted contextual information from the record.\u201d <em>State v. B. B., </em>240 Or App 75, 77, 245 P3d 697 (2010) (quoting <em>State v. D. R., </em>239 Or App 576, 579, 244 P3d 916 (2010)).</p>\n<p id=\"b201-4\">Appellant was arrested and charged with second-degree disorderly conduct and second-degree criminal trespass. No information about the arrest, nor any facts underlying those charges, is in the record, except that appellant\u2019s conduct apparently involved \u201clooking in people\u2019s houses.\u201d Appellant was held in the Douglas County Jail for an unspecified period of time, later described by appellant as \u201cnot long[,]\u201d during which he refused to eat or drink and behaved in such a manner that jail employees believed he was \u201cpsychotic,\u201d \u201cdisorganized [and] delusional,\u201d experiencing hallucinations, and \u201cunable to take care of himself.\u201d Based on those conditions, appellant was taken to an emergency room on October 6, 2014, where the admitting physician described him as \u201cagitated, * * * confused and unable to care for himself.\u201d The physician also described appellant as \u201cfrankly psychotic\u201d with \u201ctangential speech [and] flight of ideas.\u201d The next day, appellant was involuntarily admitted on a physician\u2019s hold at the Bay Area Hospital in Coos Bay. There, treating physicians elected to extend the \u201chold\u201d for a \u201cdiversion\u201d period of 14 days.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">During that period, a mental health investigator recommended that appellant be civilly committed into state custody on the grounds that appellant was a danger <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>to himself and others and was unable to meet his own basic health and safety needs. A hearing was held on October 23, 2014.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">At the hearing, the state called one witness, Dr. Young, a psychiatrist who had been treating appellant at Bay Area Hospital. Young testified that appellant, who was 45 years old at the time of the hearing, was suffering from \u201clong-standing\u201d schizoaffective disorder with psychosis and had been \u201csince before he was an adult.\u201d While hospitalized, appellant received two prescriptions to treat his schizoaf-fective disorder. Appellant had been \u201ccompliant and cooperative\u201d in taking those prescriptions until the morning of the commitment hearing, at which point he refused to take them.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-6\">Young also explained that appellant had been hospitalized on at least two prior occasions at Bay Area Hospital, most recently from August 27 to September 19, 2014. Young did not describe the circumstances that led to either earlier hospitalization but said that, after \u201cthe last two times\u201d appellant was released from the hospital, appellant stopped taking his prescriptions \u201cvery shortly thereafter\u201d and had not pursued any mental health treatment on his own.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-7\">Young also described his reasons for believing that appellant posed a danger to others:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-8\">\u201c[P]rior to [appellant\u2019s current] admission!,] he was looking in people\u2019s houses, which might have resulted in some violent encounter but, more importantly, since he\u2019s been admitted he frequently attacks other male peers verbally and then will stare at them and then starts to swing through the air. He hasn\u2019t actually hit anyone but he does this almost on a daily basis. Yesterday, he threw a water bottle during this episode and he challenged a couple of the other patients, male patients, to a fight but they did not react. He also threatens staff when they try to intervene.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b202-9\">Young later clarified that appellant \u201cdoesn\u2019t attempt to hit [other patients] but he approaches them and swings in their direction,\u201d and that \u201che threatens to beat up the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>other patients and he threatened staff with violence.\u201d Young also noted that these were \u201cunprovoked attacks\u201d and that appellant had made those threats \u201cevery day,\u201d perhaps \u201cin response to hallucinations telling him to do that.\u201d As a result, appellant had been placed in seclusion \u201cnearly every other day\u201d while hospitalized. The day before the hearing, appellant was locked in seclusion and hospital staff were \u201cunable to release him\u201d because he was \u201cvery agitated, and kicking * * * and beating on the doors.\u201d However, Young was unaware of any history of violent behavior by appellant before his hospitalization. Young noted that, during appellant\u2019s past hospitalization a few weeks earlier, appellant exhibited \u201cthe same behavior of becoming very angry and loud mid-mornings.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b203-4\">Young also testified that, in addition to schizoaf-fective disorder, appellant was being treated with three medications for \u201csevere hypertension.\u201d Young was \u201cnot sure what [appellant\u2019s] prognosis would be if he were never treated [,] but it certainly would be very hard on his arteries and his brain.\u201d During appellant\u2019s last hospitalization, he had taken medication for his hypertension while there, but it was Young\u2019s \u201cimpression\u201d that, after being released, appellant \u201ctook his medicines, if at all, only for a very short period.\u201d As to his physical condition, appellant was not malnourished when he arrived at the hospital, he had been eating, drinking, and sleeping adequately while there, and his weight had been \u201cconsistent.\u201d Young also had no knowledge of appellant\u2019s living situation prior to his current hospitalization other than that \u201che tends to move around a good deal.\u201d Young nevertheless concluded that \u201ctwo issues\u201d would \u201cinterfere\u201d with appellant\u2019s ability to care for himself outside a hospital setting:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b203-5\">\u201cFirst, he has delusions and if he were to make and implement a plan it might be to do something that had nothing to do with reality. The second problem is he\u2019s not really thinking in an organized way that he could make and implement a plan. So for those reasons I don\u2019t think he would survive long at all.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">The trial court also received a report from a mental health examiner, Abrahamson, who had examined appellant the day of the hearing and was present during the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>hearing. Abrahamson\u2019s report noted, in relevant part, that appellant\u2019s \u201cverbal behavior was aggressive and angry\u201d; that appellant \u201coften lives with his parents\u201d who reside in Minnesota, and that his \u201ccurrent housing [was] unknown.\u201d Further, Abrahamson noted that appellant \u201cprovokes [and] threatens other persons\u201d at the hospital, that staff was \u201crequired to intervene in these altercations [,] \u201d and that appellant\u2019s \u201cbehaviors indicate a lack of behavioral control and he appears at a high risk to harm someone else or get harmed by others if not in a supervised setting.\u201d Abrahamson\u2019s report concluded that appellant \u201cappears to be too delusional and disorganized in his thinking to provide for his own health and safety. He has no one to assist him.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b204-4\">Appellant also testified at the hearing. When asked about \u201cattacking\u201d other patients at the hospital, appellant responded, in part, \u201cThey have a lot of juvenile delinquents that come there and I have to protect myself so I choose solitary confinement.\u201d When asked whether he wanted to hurt anyone, appellant responded, \u201cNo.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">On cross-examination, appellant made a number of statements, including, among others, that it was \u201can easy walk\u201d from Portland to Roseburg and that he had previously walked to Alaska from Oregon to see his girlfriend. He also said that he was living outside and \u201cat the Motel 6 until [he] ran out of money\u201d and that he had \u201ca thousand dollars\u201d in a bank account.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-6\">At the conclusion of the hearing, the trial court found that appellant was not a danger to himself, but was a danger to others and was unable to provide for his own basic needs. The court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b205-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>\u201cWell, I find that he is suffering from a mental disease or disorder described as, I think, as schizoaffective disorder with psychosis. He certainly appears to be, based upon his behavior here in court and what he says what he wants to do and has done he is lacking a perception of reality by his behavior here in court and based upon that it has affected him. I\u2019m not finding that he\u2019s dangerous to himself. The only way that he\u2019s dangerous to himself is if one of the other patients were to react and injure him in response to his threats or his behavior to them and that is not as direct, I think, as required.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b205-3\">\u201cI\u2019m finding that he is dangerous to others. But for the intervention of staff in those altercations or swings and threats, and I did hear about threats towards staff and agitation and him swinging at others. But for the intervention of staff someone was going to get injured. If not him, it\u2019s going to be somebody else. He also appears unable to care for his basic needs based upon the reference to and his report here to not eating, drinking, and that\u2019s what led to his being taken to the hospital. Currently, but for the hospitalization, he wouldn\u2019t be able to care for himself. He\u2019s delusional about his walking to Alaska. He says he walked from here to Portland and his plans for himself if he wasn\u2019t hospitalized and based upon that I\u2019m finding and I am directing him to be placed in the custody of the hospital for up to six months. And, as well, he wouldn\u2019t voluntarily medicate himself or deal with any treatment. And based upon that I\u2019m going to commit him to the Mental Health Division for a period not to exceed six months.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b205-4\">On appeal, the trial court\u2019s finding that appellant suffers from a mental disorder is not disputed. Rather, the parties\u2019 arguments focus on the findings that appellant is a danger to others and is unable to provide for his own basic needs.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">To establish that a person is a danger to others, \u201cthe state must establish that \u2018actual future violence is highly likely.\u2019\u201d <em>State v. M. </em>A., 276 Or App 624, 629, 371 P3d 495 (2016) (quoting <em>State v. L. D., </em>247 Or App 394, 400, 270 P3d 324 (2011)). Accordingly, the question on appeal is whether the evidence in the record would permit the finding that, as of the time of the hearing, it was highly likely that appellant would engage in violence in the future.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>Here, the evidence is insufficient to permit that determination. There is no evidence in the record that appellant has ever actually engaged in violent conduct, despite being 45 years old and having suffered from serious mental illness since his youth. Although the record contains evidence that, in the two-week period preceding the commitment hearing, appellant was confrontational and made verbal threats and threatening gestures on a daily basis, including swinging his arms at other patients, there is no evidence that appellant was at risk of actually hitting someone. On the contrary, the uncontroverted evidence\u2014in the form of testimony from Young\u2014was that appellant did <em>not </em>attempt to hit anybody.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-4\">Notwithstanding the lack of any direct evidence of historical or intended violence by appellant, the trial court relied on the evidence that staff members intervened and placed appellant in seclusion to infer that appellant was engaging in conduct that made him dangerous to others. Although that might have been a reasonable inference on a different record, it is not reasonable on this record in light of Young\u2019s affirmative testimony that appellant did <em>not </em>attempt to hit anyone. In light of that testimony, the evidence of intervention by staff is equally consistent with an inference that staff acted simply to maintain order by removing a disruptive person.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">For those reasons, we conclude that the evidence in the record was not sufficient to permit the finding that it was highly likely that appellant would engage in future violence. Accordingly, the trial court erred in civilly committing appellant on the ground that he was a danger to others.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-6\">We must next consider whether the trial court erred in concluding that appellant was unable to meet his own <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>basic health and safety needs due to his mental illness.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> To meet that standard, the state must establish by clear and convincing evidence that \u201cthe individual, due to a mental disorder, is unable to obtain some commodity <em>(e.g., </em>food and water) or service <em>(e.g., </em>life-saving medical care) without which [the individual] cannot sustain life.\u201d <em>State v. Bunting, </em>112 Or App 143, 145, 826 P2d 1060 (1992). The legislature\u2019s \u201cbasic needs\u201d commitment standard \u201cfocuses on the capacity of the individual to survive, either through [the individual\u2019s] own resources or with the help of family or friends.\u201d <em>Id.; see also State v. Sea, </em>137 Or App 333, 336, 904 P2d 182 (1995) (\u201cBasic needs are those things necessary to sustain life.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.)). While the state \u201c\u2018need not postpone commitment until the mentally ill person is on the brink of death,\u201d\u2019 the purpose of the statute is \u201c\u2018to authorize involuntary commitment only when an imminent threat to safe survival exists.\u2019\u201d <em>M. A., </em>276 Or App at 631 (quoting <em>State v. M. C., </em>227 Or App 530, 534, 206 P3d 1096 (2009)).</p>\n<p id=\"b207-4\">In this case, the state argues that the trial court\u2019s basic-needs determination is supported by evidence of appellant\u2019s refusal to eat or drink while in jail; his delusions about being able to walk to Alaska; his \u201csevere hypertension which, if left untreated, would put him at risk of a heart attack or stroke\u201d; his inability to implement and make a plan for meeting his needs upon release from the hospital; and his failure to follow a treatment regimen after previous hospitalizations. For the reasons explained below, that evidence is insufficient to support the inference that appellant\u2019s near-term survival was in jeopardy at the time of the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">The significance of appellant\u2019s refusal to eat and drink while in jail is undermined by the lack of information about the duration of the jail stay, other than appellant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>testimony that it was \u201cnot long.\u201d Moreover, there is no evidence that he was malnourished when he arrived there, or that his health was affected by his refusal to eat and drink for that indeterminate period. Young testified that, at the time of the commitment hearing, appellant was eating, drinking, and sleeping adequately and that his weight had not changed. In short, the record does not support a rational inference that appellant\u2019s diet, at the time of the hearing, posed a threat to his well-being.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-4\">Likewise, although appellant suffers from delusions, the record contains no evidence that any of those delusions have manifested in ways that threaten his life or health. Appellant\u2019s beliefs that it is \u201can easy walk\u201d between Portland and Roseburg and that he has walked from Oregon to Alaska may be objectively unreasonable, but there is no evidence in the record that those beliefs pose a risk to his \u201ccapacity * * * to survive.\u201d <em>Bunting, </em>112 Or App at 145.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-5\">Although appellant\u2019s failure to consistently take medication for his hypertension may be unwise, on this record, any inference that that failure jeopardizes his near-term survival is speculative. The record is devoid of evidence regarding the short-term medical consequences of appellant\u2019s failing to take hypertension medication regularly, and Young testified affirmatively that he was \u201cnot sure what [appellant\u2019s] prognosis would be if he were never treated.\u201d <em>See State v. H. N., </em>180 Or App 541, 544, 547, 43 P3d 1218 (2002) (reversing an appellant\u2019s civil commitment on the grounds that he was unable to care for himself, despite the appellant\u2019s refusal to acknowledge and comply with treatment for his mental illness and serious diabetic condition\u2014which put him at great risk of losing limbs and blindness\u2014because those circumstances did not amount to a failure to meet \u201chis basic <em>needs\u2014i.e., </em>food, water, shelter, and life saving medical treatment\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b208-6\">Finally, there is no evidence that appellant\u2019s inability to follow a plan \u201cwould threaten his near-term survival.\u201d <em>M. A., </em>276 Or App at 632. Even assuming that appellant would be homeless if not hospitalized, \u201chomelessness is not, by itself, sufficient grounds for a \u2018basic needs\u2019 commitment\u201d absent evidence that would permit an inference that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>homelessness, under the circumstances, would jeopardize appellant\u2019s near-term survival. <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>State v. T. L. H., </em>202 Or App 63, 67, 121 P3d 17 (2005) (brackets omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b209-3\">In sum, the evidentiary record is legally insufficient to support a finding that appellant was a danger to others or unable to provide for his basic needs. Therefore, the trial court erred in committing appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-4\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b201-6\"> As described in OAR 309-033-0210, diversion is a \u201c14 day period of intensive treatment when a director and a psychiatrist certify a person as a mentally ill person pursuant to the provision of ORS 426.237(l)(b).\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b202-10\"> The record does not specify that appellant hit anyone with the water bottle, nor did it specify as to whether he was attempting to throw it at anyone in particular or whether it was full or empty.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b204-7\"> Appellant contends that Abrahamson\u2019s report is not properly considered part of the trial record because it was not \u201cadmitted\u201d at the commitment hearing. We first note that that contention is unpreserved, as appellant raised no objection regarding whether Abrahamson\u2019s report was properly received into evidence when it was offered to the trial court. <em>See State v. Wyatt, </em>331 Or 335, 341, 15 P3d 22 (2000) (\u201cGenerally, an issue not preserved in the trial court will not be considered on appeal.\u201d). Further, the record shows that Abrahamson submitted his report to the trial court, and the court acknowledged its receipt by requiring Abrahamson, under oath, to swear to the veracity of its contents. We, therefore, conclude that the record adequately shows that the report was admitted into evidence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b206-7\"> As noted above, the trial court also received a report from Abrahamson opining that appellant was dangerous. It is apparent from the record, however, that Abrahamson based that opinion on the evidence that staff intervened to seclude appellant from other patients. But, as we have explained, on this record, in light of Young\u2019s testimony that appellant did not try to hit anyone, the fact that staff intervened and placed appellant in seclusion is insufficient to support a rational inference that appellant was highly likely to commit violence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b207-6\"> In 2015, the legislature amended the \u201cbasic needs\u201d provision of the civil commitment statute. <em>See former </em>ORS 426.005(1)(e)(B) (2013), <em>amended by </em>Or Laws 2015, ch 433, \u00a7 1, <em>renumbered as </em>ORS 426.005(l)(f)(B) (2015). Because the amended statute did not provide for retroactive application, we apply the statutory language that existed at the time of appellant\u2019s hearing. <em>See Black v. Arizala, </em>337 Or 250, 271, 95 P3d 1109 (2004) (applying law as it existed prior to amendment, absent retroactivity provision).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
