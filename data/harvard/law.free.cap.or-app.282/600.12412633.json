Despite having stipulated to that sanction, defendant asserts that the trial court erred in imposing a Measure 11-based probation sanction and argues that the court was limited to a sanction based on the felony sentencing guidelines. The state responds that we lack jurisdiction to consider defendant\u2019s appeal under ORS 138.222(7)(b), which requires defendants to show \u201ccolorable\u201d claims of error in appeals from certain sentencing procedures, and that ORS 138.222(2)(d) bars review of a \u201csentence resulting from a stipulated sentencing agreement.\u201d The state further argues that, even if defendant\u2019s assignment of error is appealable and reviewable, it is unpreserved and is not plain error. Relying on our recent decision in <em>State v. Silsby, </em>282 Or App 104, 105, 386 P3d 172 (2016), we conclude that, although defendant\u2019s assignment of error is appealable, it is unreviewable. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-4\">The relevant facts in this case are straightforward and undisputed. Defendant pleaded guilty to two counts of assault in the second degree, a Measure 11 offense.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In the judgment of conviction, the trial court noted that defendant\u2019s offenses were classified as level 9-H convictions in the felony sentencing guidelines and that they were presumptively subject to increased mandatory minimum sentences under Measure 11. The court, however, entered a \u201cdownward dispositional departure from defendant\u2019s ORS 137.700 [Measure 11] presumptive sentence of 70 months prison, based upon the stipulation of the parties\u201d and imposed a probationary sentence of five years. The judgment of conviction reflected the parties\u2019 stipulation that, \u201cupon finding of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>a non-monetary breach of probation, defendant\u2019s probation shall be revoked and he shall be sentenced to * * * a period of 70 months [incarceration] pursuant to ORS 137.700 [Measure 11].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b624-4\">The trial court subsequently found that defendant had violated a nonmonetary condition of his probation and, accordingly, revoked probation. As a sanction for defendant\u2019s probation violation, the state asked the court to impose 70 months\u2019 incarceration, as contemplated by the parties\u2019 earlier stipulation and the judgment of conviction. Defendant did not argue that a 70-month sanction was legally impermissible, but, nonetheless, asked the court to impose a lesser sanction. The court rejected defendant\u2019s request and imposed a 70-month term.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-5\">Defendant now appeals and raises the unpreserved argument that the trial court erred in sanctioning him based on his stipulation and in reliance on Measure 11. Defendant does not dispute that he was subject to Measure 11 at the time of his original sentencing. However, because the trial court granted him a departure sentence of probation under ORS 137.712(1)(a), he argues that ORS 137.545(5)(b)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> authorized a revocation sanction of no more than the maximum presumptive prison term set forth in the applicable sentencing guidelines grid block.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b624-6\">We first consider the state\u2019s argument that defendant\u2019s probation sanction is not appealable. <em>See State v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number><em>Stubbs, </em>193 Or App 596, 598-99, 91 P3d 774, <em>rev den, </em>337 Or 669 (2004) (a court must address appealability before turning to the question of reviewability); <em>State v. Bowman, </em>160 Or App 8, 16, 980 P2d 164 (1999), <em>rev den, </em>333 Or 655 (2002) (appealability is a preliminary question and implicates jurisdictional concerns). The state argues that defendant cannot appeal his probation sanction under ORS 138.222(7)(b) (requiring a \u201ccolorable\u201d claim of error), because ORS 138.222(2)(d) renders defendant\u2019s assignment of error unre-viewable. In other words, the state argues that a claim of error that cannot be reviewed cannot be \u201ccolorable,\u201d because it has no chance of succeeding on its merits. Our recent decision in <em>Silsby, </em>however, forecloses that argument, and we therefore reject it without further discussion. 282 Or App at 105; <em>see id. </em>at 109 (claim that the sentence that the trial court imposed exceeded the court\u2019s authority under the sentencing guidelines raised a \u201cplausible showing that the trial court erred\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b625-4\">Having rejected the state\u2019s argument that we lack jurisdiction over defendant\u2019s appeal, we turn next to the question of whether defendant\u2019s assignment of error is reviewable. <em>See id. </em>at 107-10 (considering reviewability as an inquiry distinct from appealability upon concluding that the court had jurisdiction); <em>Bowman, </em>160 Or App at 16 (reviewability, in contrast to the jurisdictional question of appealability, \u201cconcerns what rulings or issues can be raised on appeal\u201d). The state argues that, because defendant stipulated to the sanction imposed, ORS 138.222(2)(d) renders that sanction unreviewable. By its terms, that statute bars review, on appeal from \u201ca judgment of conviction,\u201d of \u201c[a]ny sentence resulting from a stipulated sentencing agreement between the state and the defendant which the sentencing court approves on the record.\u201d Defendant contends that, for two reasons, ORS 138.222(2)(d) does not apply to his appeal and, therefore, does not render his sanction unreviewable. First, defendant argues that a judgment revoking probation is not a judgment of conviction that is subject to the restrictions of ORS 138.222(2)(d). Second, relying on <em>State v. Kephart, </em>320 Or 433, 447, 887 P2d 774 (1994), defendant argues that ORS 138.222(2)(d) precludes review only of stipulations of the type contemplated by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>ORS 135.407,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> a provision that has no bearing on this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-4\">Again, our decision in <em>Silsby </em>is dispositive. <em>See </em>282 Or App at 110-13. In <em>Silsby, </em>we rejected identical arguments by the defendant and agreed with the state that ORS 138.222(2)(d) precluded our review of the defendant\u2019s claim that the trial court was not authorized to impose the revocation sanction that the defendant had stipulated to in her judgment of conviction. 282 Or App at 110-13. For the reasons articulated in that case, we likewise agree with the state here that we may not review the sanction that defendant stipulated to and that the trial court imposed. <em>See id. </em>Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b623-5\"> Measure 11, codified at ORS 137.700, mandates minimum prison terms for certain felonies.
