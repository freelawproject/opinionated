In his first assignment of error, appellant argues that the trial court plainly erred by failing to advise him of his rights under ORS 426.100(1).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See State v. M. L. R., </em>256 Or App 566, 570-71, 303 P3d 954 (2013) (the \u201cfailure to provide a person with all of the information required by ORS 426.100(1) constitutes an egregious error that justifies plain error review\u201d). The state concedes that \u201cnothing in the record indicates that the trial court advised appellant regarding the rights listed in ORS 426.100(1),\u201d and that \u201c[t]hat omission constitutes plain error and requires reversal.\u201d We agree, accept the state\u2019s concession, and, for the reasons explained in <em>M. L. R., </em>we exercise our discretion to correct the error.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b390-6\"> Appellant raises two other assignments of error. He assigns error to the trial court\u2019s ruling admitting portions of an investigator\u2019s report over his hearsay objection. He also assigns error to the trial court\u2019s determination that he was a person with a mental illness as defined in ORS 426.005(1)(f), arguing that the record lacked legally sufficient evidence to support that determination. In light of our resolution of appellant\u2019s first assignment of error, we need not address his other assignments.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
