The juvenile court took jurisdiction over the child based on allegations that mother and father failed to maintain a safe environment for the child because they exposed her to the production or manufacture of byproducts of marijuana, and an allegation that another child suffered a serious nonaccidental injury while in father\u2019s care. The court concluded that DHS failed to prove an allegation against mother related to the serious nonaccidental injury of the \u201cother child,\u201d concluding that father had caused the injuries and mother had responded appropriately upon learning of the injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">DHS concedes on appeal that the record below is insufficient to prove that, at the time of the jurisdictional hearing, parents\u2019 past involvement in the \u201cproduction or manufacture of byproducts of marijuana\u201d created a <em>current </em>risk of harm to the child\u2019s welfare. DHS also concedes that, because the juvenile court dismissed the \u201conly other allegation related to mother\u2019s ability to safely parent [the child],\u201d we must reverse the juvenile court\u2019s judgment. <em>See Dept. of Human Services v. W. A. C., </em>263 Or App 382, 392, 328 P3d 769 (2014) (concluding that juvenile court jurisdiction is not warranted if a child has a parent who appears in the proceeding and is capable of caring for the child safely).</p>\n<p id=\"b224-6\">We agree with and accept DHS\u2019s concession. Accordingly, we reverse the jurisdictional judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-7\">Reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
