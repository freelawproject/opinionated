On appeal, he raises three assignments of error. We reject all but one without discussion. We address only petitioner\u2019s claim that the post-conviction court\u2019s judgment does not comply with ORS 138.640(1) with respect to one of his claims for relief. Defendant concedes petitioner\u2019s argument and agrees that \"the post-conviction court did not comply with ORS 138.640(1).\u201d We agree as well. Accordingly, we reverse and remand for the court to include the findings required by ORS 138.640(1) with respect to petitioner\u2019s fifth claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">ORS 138.640(1) provides, in part, that a \u201cjudgment [denying claims for post-conviction relief] must clearly state the grounds on which the cause was determined.\u201d Interpreting that statute, the Oregon Supreme Court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-6\">\u201c[A] judgment denying claims for post-conviction relief must, at a minimum: (1) identify the claims for relief that the court considered and make separate rulings on each claim; (2) declare, with regard to each claim, whether the denial is based on a petitioner\u2019s failure to utilize or follow available state procedures or a failure to establish the merits of the claim; and (3) make the legal bases for denial of relief apparent.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b228-7\"><em>Datt v. Hill, </em>347 Or 672, 685, 227 P3d 714 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b228-8\">Here, the post-conviction court\u2019s judgment does not comply with <em>Datt. </em>Petitioner advanced five claims for relief for ineffective assistance of counsel. The post-conviction court\u2019s judgment sufficiently addressed each of petitioner\u2019s first four claims under <em>Datt. </em>However, the judgment failed to identify and make a separate ruling on petitioner\u2019s fifth claim for ineffective assistance of counsel. Therefore, the judgment does not comply with ORS 138.640(1) as interpreted by Datt.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-9\">Because the post-conviction court\u2019s judgment in this case fails to comply with ORS 138.640(1), we reverse and remand for the court to enter a new judgment that complies with that statute with respect to petitioner\u2019s fifth claim. <em>Myers v. Brockamp, 271 Or </em>App 716, 718, 353 P3d 1 (2015).</p>\n<p id=\"b229-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>Reversed and remanded as to Claim 5 for entry of judgment including findings required by ORS 138.640(1); otherwise affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
