We reject without discussion defendant\u2019s second and third assignments of error, in which he contends that the trial court erred in instructing the jury that it could find him guilty by a nonunanimous verdict and by accepting a nonunanimous verdict. <em>See State v. Bowen, </em>215 Or App 199, 168 P3d 1208 (2007), <em>adh\u2019d to as modified on recons, </em>220 Or App 380, 185 P3d 1129, <em>rev den, </em>345 Or 415 (2008), <em>cert den, </em>558 US 815 (2009). We write to address defendant\u2019s first assignment of error, in which he argues that the trial court plainly erred in failing to <em>sua sponte </em>\u201cexclude *** or instruct the jury to disregard\u201d a police officer\u2019s testimony that, according to defendant, constituted a comment on defendant\u2019s credibility. As explained below, we reject defendant\u2019s contention and, accordingly, affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">On March 11, 2013, the Gresham police received a call reporting that someone had been robbed at knife point at the 7-Eleven store on the corner of Hogan and Division in Gresham. When officers responded to the call, the only people at the 7-Eleven were the victim, Gurpreet Singh, and Gurcharan Singh, both of whom worked at the store. The victim and Gurcharan reported that the victim had been robbed, and that Gurcharan had witnessed what happened. Based on the information the two men provided, officers arrested defendant, who was ultimately charged with first-degree robbery, unlawful use of a weapon, fourth-degree assault, and harassment.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-6\">At trial, the victim testified that, prior to the incident in question, defendant often came to the store to return cans. Defendant had also behaved in a way that the victim found scary and threatening. Specifically, according to the victim, defendant would come up to the 7-Eleven window and press his hands against the glass and \u201cthen laugh loud.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b496-7\">On the day in question, Gurcharan arrived at the store around 9:00 p.m. and saw defendant sitting on top of a Redbox DVD kiosk outside. He told the victim, who was working in the store, what he had seen. The victim testified <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>that he went outside and told defendant several times to get down and to leave and that, eventually, defendant did so.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-4\">According to the victim, later that evening, he went out to clean the parking lot of the store and again found defendant on top of the kiosk. He told defendant to come down and defendant jumped down, grabbing the victim by the collar and scratching him in the process. The victim testified that defendant let go of his collar, punched him on the side, and then pulled out a knife and said he wanted money. The victim put his hands up and told defendant he did not have any money. Gurcharan then came outside. He testified that he saw defendant with the knife, and screamed at defendant, \u201cDon\u2019t do that.\u201d Defendant then ran away and, shortly thereafter, the victim called 9-1-1 to report the incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">Defendant, who has been diagnosed with schizophrenia, testified that he had climbed on top of the kiosk on the day in question because he was experiencing delusions. He testified that, the first time he climbed on the kiosk, the victim pulled him down and went back in the store. He also testified that he went back to the kiosk and got back on it that evening. However, defendant denied having had a second interaction with the victim and testified that he did not threaten the victim, demand money, or otherwise try to rob the victim. He explained that the victim was his neighbor and, according to both defendant and his girlfriend, they did not have a good relationship.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-6\">Webb, one of the officers who responded to the robbery report, testified at trial regarding the investigation and his interview with defendant after defendant was arrested. The state played a portion of Webb\u2019s recorded interview of defendant for the jury, noting beforehand that it would play the recording and then talk with the officer <em>\u201ca </em>little bit about what [he was] thinking, what was going on in the process.\u201d After playing the recording, the state asked Webb about his interview style and Webb explained that his questioning was intended to cause defendant to be honest about the incident:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b497-7\">\u201cQ. And * * * it seems like in the interview, you know, you are trying to give him a little bit of a, \u2018Hey, maybe it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>was just a fight or.\u2019 And what\u2019s the purpose there in terms of * * * your interview style to talk to somebody?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b498-4\">\u201cA. Uhm, I\u2019m trying to just get him to tell me honestly what happened instead of worrying about, you know, who it was. That was a big *** thing, was [defendant] wanted to know who was reporting this. I just wanted him to be honest with me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b498-5\">\u201cQ. Okay. And *** when you asked him about the knives, initially he says he doesn\u2019t own any. And then you are pretty surprised by that; fair to say?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b498-6\">\u201cA. Yeah.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b498-7\">\u201cQ. And so you press a little bit further; is that right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b498-8\">\u201cA. Mm-hmm.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b498-9\">\u201cQ. And * * * he explains that he has got some kitchen knives?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b498-10\">\u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b498-11\">\u201cQ. And * * * so you follow up again in terms of * <em>* </em>* additional knives; is that right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b498-12\">\u201cA. Mm-hmm.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b498-13\">\u201cQ. And that\u2019s just kind of\u2014I mean, you don\u2019t have any particularized knowledge. He didn\u2019t have a knife when you took him into custody? * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b498-14\">\u201cA. Yeah. It seemed odd to me that all you would have is kitchen knives. It seems like a lot of people have utility knives or, you know, small pocket knives for utility reasons.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b498-15\">\u00ab* * * * \u215c</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b498-16\">\u201cQ. Okay. I\u2019m not going to play it, but essentially, you kind of intimate that you are going to be going to his house?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b498-17\">\u201cA. Mm-hmm.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b498-18\">\u201cQ. And what\u2019s the purpose of that *** I guess you have at that point, right\u2014\u2022</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b498-19\">\u201cA. Mm-hmm.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b498-20\">\u201cQ. Could have applied for a warrant on his house?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b498-21\">\u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b498-22\">\u201cQ. Okay. And so\u2014in terms of intimating that\u2014-what\u2019s the purpose of that in talking to him?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>\u201cA. Because if he thinks that I\u2019m going to go and, you know, look in his house, I\u2019m going to find out that he\u2019s being untruthful. Because everybody has something other than kitchen knives for the most part in every house that I\u2019ve been into. But saying that to him would, you know, encourage honesty because his facts are going to be checked.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-4\">\u201cQ. Okay. And did it, in fact, work? I mean, was that something\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-5\">\u201cA. It did. The first time I asked him, I specifically asked him, \u2018You don\u2019t have any other kinds of knives or daggers?\u2019 And then when I came back, I asked him, \u2018You know, are you sure you don\u2019t have any knives or daggers or anything like that?\u2019 And he came out that he has a sword and a dagger and I\u2019m not sure if he had any other knives. But he specifically stated that he had a sword and a dagger.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b499-6\">On cross-examination, defendant asked Webb additional questions regarding his interview techniques:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-7\">\u201cQ. How many hours *** of interrogation training have you received?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-8\">\u201cA. I don\u2019t know the hours off the top of my head, but we do have, you know, at least a four-hour class or a block of class on asking people questions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-9\">\u201cQ. Is one of the techniques to give them sort of an easy way out, ways out, give then sort of, \u2018Well, maybe you did this in self defense.\u2019 Give them like\u2014to try and help then rationalize why they did the crime that you are saying they did?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-10\">\u201cA. Sure.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-11\">\u201cQ. Did you do that with [defendant]?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-12\">\u201cA. Uhm\u2014I mean, I provided that as an option for him maybe. <em>I didn\u2019t feel like he was being honest with me, </em>so I was trying to figure out what, if any, reason he had to do this.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-13\">\u201cQ. Okay. And specifically, do you remember saying, \u2018So if you don\u2019t care about getting arrested, why wouldn\u2019t you defend yourself?\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-15\">\u201cA. Mim-hmm.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-16\">\u201cQ. Do you remember that? So you are giving him the option of maybe he was doing this in self defense?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>\u201cA. Yeah. I was trying to get [defendant] to say that he produced a knife and said these things to [the victim]. So I, you know, created a scenario for him in which he had an out, a reason for why he did something.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-4\">\u201cQ. Did he take your out?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-5\">\u201cA. He didn\u2019t.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b500-6\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b500-7\">Ultimately, the jury found defendant guilty of fourth-degree assault and acquitted him on the charges of first-degree robbery, unlawful use of a weapon, and harassment.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-8\">As noted, on appeal, defendant asserts that the trial court erred in \u201cpermitting Officer Webb to testify that he believed defendant was not being honest.\u201d That is, defendant challenges the admission of Webb\u2019s statement, in response to defendant\u2019s questioning on cross-examination, that Webb \u201cdidn\u2019t feel like [defendant] was being honest with\u201d him. In defendant\u2019s view, that testimony constituted an improper comment on defendant\u2019s credibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-9\">In Oregon, the rule is that \u201ca witness, expert or otherwise, may not give an opinion on whether he believes a witness is telling the truth.\u201d <em>State v. Middleton, </em>294 Or 427, 438, 657 P2d 1215 (1983); <em>see State v. Chandler, </em>360 Or 323, 330, 380 P3d 932 (2016) (\u201cThis court has long held that one witness may not comment on the credibility of another witness.\u201d).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-10\">\u201cThat rule applies \u2018whether the witness is testifying about the credibility of the other witness in relation to the latter\u2019s testimony at trial or is testifying about the credibility of the other witness in relation to the statements made by the latter on some other occasion or for some reason unrelated to the current litigation.\u2019\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b500-11\"><em>State v. Wilson, </em>266 Or App 481, 489, 337 P3d 990 (2014), <em>rev den, </em>356 Or 837 (2015) (quoting <em>State v. Keller, </em>315 Or 273, 285, 844 P3d 195 (1993)); <em>see Chandler, </em>360 Or at 331 (\u201cThis court has * * * made clear that the rule applies to credibility opinions and statements that a witness made either at trial or on some other occasion.\u201d); <em>see also id. </em>at 330 (\u201cThe rule prohibiting vouching testimony * * * serves the policy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>goals of ensuring that the jury remains the sole arbiter of witness credibility and that the jury\u2019s role in assessing witness credibility is not usurped by another witness\u2019s opinion testimony.\u201d). As we noted in <em>Wilson,</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-4\">\u201c[e]xamples of testimony that is impermissible as a direct opinion on the honesty or credibility of another witness include (1) testimony by the victim\u2019s mother that she never doubted [the victim] for a second, <em>State v. Vargas-Samado, </em>223 Or App 15, 17, 195 P3d 464 (2008); (2) testimony that there is no lying going on about what [the complainant is] telling us in this evaluation, <em>State v. Hollywood, </em>250 Or App 675, 677, 282 P3d 944 (2012); and (3) testimony that the witness didn\u2019t think that [the defendant] was being very honest and upfront, <em>State v. Lowell, </em>249 Or App 364, 366, 277 P3d 588, <em>rev den, </em>352 Or 378 (2012).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b501-6\">266 Or App at 489-90 (second and fourth brackets in original; internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b501-7\">In this case, defendant acknowledges that he failed to preserve his contention that Webb\u2019s statement on cross-examination constituted an improper comment on defendant\u2019s credibility. However, he asserts that the trial court plainly erred in \u201callowing\u201d the testimony. <em>See </em>ORAP 5.45(1) (we consider only claims of error that are \u201cpreserved in the lower court * * * provided that the appellate court may consider an error of law apparent on the record\u201d). In considering an unpreserved claim of error, we first determine whether the trial court plainly erred. An error is \u201cplain\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-8\">\u201cif (1) the error is one of law, (2) the error is obvious, not reasonably in dispute, and (3) the error appears on the face of the record, so that we need not go outside the record to identify the error or choose between competing inferences, and the facts constituting the error are irrefutable.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b501-9\"><em>State v. Corkill, </em>262 Or App 543, 551, 325 P3d 796, <em>rev den, </em>355 Or 751 (2014) (internal quotation marks omitted). If we determine that the trial court plainly erred, we must consider whether to exercise our discretion to correct the error. In making that determination, we consider, among other things,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-10\">\u201cthe competing interests of the parties; the nature of the case; the gravity of the error; the ends of justice in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>particular case; how the error came to the court\u2019s attention; and whether the policies behind the rule requiring preservation of error have been served in another way, <em>i.e., </em>whether the trial court was, in some manner, presented with both sides of the issue and given an opportunity to correct any error.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b502-4\"><em>Ailes v. Portland Meadows, Inc., </em>312 Or 376, 382 n 6, 823 P2d 956 (1991); <em>see State v. Vanornum, </em>354 Or 614, 630, 317 P3d 889 (2013) (exercise of discretion in determining whether to correct plain error \u201centails making a prudential call that takes into account an array of considerations, such as the competing interests of the parties, the nature of the case, the gravity of the error, and the ends of justice in the particular case\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">In response to defendant\u2019s assignment of error, the state contends, first, that the trial court did not plainly err because \u201cit is not clear on this record that Webb\u2019s statement constitutes\u201d an impermissible comment on defendant\u2019s credibility. In the state\u2019s view, in context, it is not clear that Webb was commenting on defendant\u2019s credibility:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-6\">\u201cWebb\u2019s testimony explained why he continued to press defendant [during the interview] after defendant denied assaulting the victim. Webb explained that defendant\u2019s answers did not always make sense, and that his answers changed during the interview. Defense counsel\u2019s questions invited Webb to elaborate further as to why he asked defendant certain questions and why he asked defendant if he had acted in self-defense [.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-7\">\u215c\u2021\u2021\u2021</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-8\">\u201cAlthough Webb did testify that he did not \u2018feel like [defendant] was being honest\u2019 with him during that particular point in the interview, his testimony was made in the context of exploring his interview style, and in response to defendant\u2019s question as to whether Webb had tried to give defendant an \u2018easy\u2019 way to justify the assault.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b502-9\">(Third brackets in original; citation omitted.) <em>See Chandler, </em>360 Or at 335-36 (trial court did not err in allowing admission of statements by an officer in a recorded interview that defendant was lying and the victims were telling the truth, where those statements were \u201coffered to provide relevant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>context for the statements that defendant made throughout the interview\u201d). The state also contends that, in any event, the asserted error does not qualify for plain error review because, to decide the issue, we would have to choose between competing inferences about whether defendant made a conscious decision not to object to the testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-4\">Even assuming, as defendant argues, that Webb\u2019s statement constitutes an improper comment on defendant\u2019s credibility, we agree with the state that the trial court\u2019s failure to exclude it does not qualify for plain error review. As we explained in <em>Corkill, </em>when the asserted plain error, with respect to a comment on credibility,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-5\">\u201cis associated with the trial court not having <em>sua sponte </em>interrupted a line of questioning (or not having excluded the resulting evidence <em>sua sponte), </em>the existence of any error does not depend solely on whether\u2014as an abstract matter\u2014the lawyer\u2019s questions or the elicited answers would have been inadmissible if they had been objected to. Rather, any \u2018plain error\u2019 must relate to the trial court having not taken affirmative steps to intervene in the parties\u2019 litigation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">262 Or App at 551. Thus, the issue we must address is whether, in this case, it was plain error for the court not to interrupt the proceedings once Webb answered defendant\u2019s question on cross-examination, and, <em>sua sponte, </em>strike the testimony in question. <em>See State v. Vage, </em>278 Or App 771, 776, 379 P3d 645 (2016) (on plain error review of an asserted comment on the credibility of a witness, \u201cwe must determine whether it was beyond dispute that the court had a duty to prevent [the] testimony from reaching the jury\u201d). We agree with the state that the trial court did not plainly err in failing to intervene and strike the testimony in this case given that one can plausibly infer from the record that defense counsel may have had a strategic purpose in not objecting.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-7\">\u201cIt is well established that an error does not qualify as plain error if the record contains a competing inference that the party may have had a strategic purpose for not objecting and that competing inference is plausible.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 777 (internal quotation marks omitted); <em>see State v. Gornick, </em>340 Or 160, 169-70, 130 P3d 780 (2006) (no plain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>error if the evidence is subject to a competing inference that the defendant had a strategic purpose in not objecting to the evidence); <em>State v. Lovern, </em>234 Or App 502, 512, 228 P3d 688 (2010) (for plain error analysis, competing inferences must be plausible); <em>see also Wilson, </em>266 Or App at 493-94 (concluding that failure to <em>sua sponte </em>strike testimony was not plain error, observing that \u201cthere was a reasonable inference that the trial court could have drawn that defense counsel had a plausible reason not to object\u201d to the question so that \u201cthe court\u2019s obligation to intervene in the examination of the witness was not clear\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b504-3\">Here, given the context of the testimony in question, it is plausible that defendant made a conscious decision not to object to it. First, we observe that, during the course of the trial in this case, defendant objected to a number of other statements by witnesses as impermissible comments on credibility, but did not do so with respect to Webb\u2019s testimony. Furthermore, the statement in question arose in the context of defendant\u2019s cross-examination of Webb regarding the techniques Webb used when interviewing defendant. Defendant then used Webb\u2019s testimony in support of his theory that the police had wrongly believed the victim in this case. He pointed out that there were \u201c[t]wo narratives\u201d\u2014 that of the victim and that of defendant\u2014and \u201cthe police show up and they make a decision which side do they want to believe.\u201d Defendant noted that Webb\u2019s interviews of the victim had been insufficient, and pointed out that it was strange and \u201cconcerning\u201d that, in spite of Webb\u2019s interviews, he did not know that the victim and defendant were neighbors, nor did he \u201cknow anything about the long relationship between these two individuals.\u201d Defendant also emphasized that, although defendant had been offered \u201ca way out\u201d by Webb during the interview (that he had acted in self-defense during his interaction with the victim), defendant did not take it because the incident described by the victim had not happened. In other words, as the state correctly observes, the statement in question supported defendant\u2019s position that \u201cthe victim was lying about what had happened and the police wrongly believed the victim, and thus \u2018interrogated\u2019 defendant under the assumption that he was guilty.\u201d Under all the circumstances, there is a plausible inference <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>that defendant made an intentional strategic choice to not interrupt his own cross-examination and ask the court to strike Webb\u2019s statement that he believed defendant was not being honest. <em>See State v. Hanson, </em>280 Or App 196, 204, 380 P3d 1136 (2016) (plausible inference that the defendant in a sexual abuse case chose not to object to vouching testimony \u201cwhere the testimony was (1) not directly related to victim\u2019s allegations of sexual abuse, but, instead, was aimed at a collateral issue; (2) not responsive to the question asked by the state; (3) from the victim\u2019s mother rather being the \u2018kind of expert vouching testimony\u2019 that most often has prompted us to reverse a criminal conviction because the trial court plainly should have stricken the testimony <em>sua sponte; </em>and (4) intentionally brought up and used by defendant on cross-examination\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b505-4\">Given the competing plausible inferences in this case, we agree with the state that the trial court did not plainly err in failing to intervene in defendant\u2019s cross-examination of the witness and strike the testimony <em>sua sponte. </em>Accordingly, we reject defendant\u2019s assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
