J.</author>\n<p id=\"b760-4\">This appeal involves an interfamily dispute among the direct and indirect owners of the 1000 Broadway Building, one of several commercial buildings developed by Tom Moyer Sr. The ownership structure for the 1000 Broadway Building involves a labyrinthine arrangement of partnership interests, but, in overly simplified terms, four trusts, one for each of Moyer Sr.\u2019s children, hold interests in the building as limited partners. A company owned by Moyer Sr.\u2019s trust is the general partner that controls the limited partnerships and, consequently, the management and finances of the building itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-5\">The complaint in this case was filed by the trustee of one of the four trusts, the Timothy P. Moyer Trust, and alleges that the various defendants breached two limited partnership agreements related to the 1000 Broadway Building by, among other things, using the limited partnership\u2019s funds for the construction of a different building, Park Avenue West.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Defendants moved to dismiss the claims, arguing that plaintiffs claims were barred because a different limited partner\u2014the trust for another of Moyer Sr.\u2019s children\u2014had previously arbitrated and settled claims based on the same set of underlying facts. The trial court treated the motions as motions for summary judgment, agreed with defendants that the claims were barred, and granted summary judgment in defendants\u2019 favor. Defendants then sought attorney fees as the prevailing parties, but the trial court denied their requests.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-6\">Plaintiff appeals the judgment against him, arguing that (1) the earlier arbitration resolved direct rather than derivative claims, so his current derivative claims are not precluded; (2) similarly, the settlement of those direct arbitration claims was never intended to bar, and could not bar, subsequent derivative claims; and (3) in any event, plaintiff has alleged direct claims that he can assert against the general partner regardless of the previous arbitration <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"739\">*739</page-number>and settlement. Defendants cross-appeal, arguing that the trial court applied an incorrect legal standard to deny their requests for attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-4\">For the reasons that follow, we disagree with the trial court\u2019s conclusions that plaintiffs derivative claims, as a matter of law, are barred by the settlement agreement in the arbitration proceeding; we conclude instead that the record presents genuine issues of material fact regarding the nature of the claims in that arbitration, as well as questions of fact regarding the scope and effect of the release provision in the settlement. However, we agree with the trial court\u2019s conclusion that plaintiff failed to state a cognizable direct claim against the general partner. Accordingly, we reverse in part and remand on appeal. In light of that resolution of plaintiffs appeal, we dismiss the cross-appeal as moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-5\">I. BACKGROUND<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b761-6\">A. <em>Moyer-related, Entities and Operations</em></p>\n<p id=\"AWd\">1. <em>The \u201c1000 Entities\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b761-7\">Moyer Sr., a real estate developer, completed the 1000 Broadway Building in downtown Portland in 1991. The building is owned by One Thousand Broadway Building Limited Partnership (1000 Broadway LP). That limited partnership has 11 limited partners, each of which is a different trust for one of Moyer Sr.\u2019s grandchildren (the \u201cGallo trusts\u201d); the Gallo trusts, collectively, hold a 50 percent interest in the limited partnership. However, control of the limited partnership\u2014and the remaining 50 percent interest\u2014is held by a general partner, 1000 Limited Partnership (1000 LP).</p>\n<p id=\"b761-8\">1000 LP, in turn, has four limited partners, each of which is a trust for one of Moyer Sr.\u2019s children: the Colleen M. Thrift Trust; the Kimberly Moyer Kassab Trust; the Thomas Peter Moyer Trust (\u201cthe Tom Moyer Jr. Trust\u201d); and the Timothy P. Moyer Trust. Those trusts each own a 24.75 percent interest in 1000 LP\u2014collectively, 99 percent of the limited partnership. The remaining one percent is held by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"740\">*740</page-number>1000 LP\u2019s general partner, 1000, Inc., a corporation that is owned and controlled by yet another trust, the Thomas P. Moyer Revocable Living Trust (\u201cthe Tom Moyer Sr. Trust\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b762-4\">2. <em>Fox Tower</em></p>\n<p id=\"b762-5\">Moyer Sr. had also developed another building, the Fox Tower, in downtown Portland, which was owned by Fox Tower, LLC. Three of the four trusts for Moyer Sr.\u2019s children\u2014the Colleen M. Thrift Trust, the Kimberly Moyer Kassab Trust, and the Tom Moyer Jr. Trust\u2014were members in Fox Tower, LLC. Moyer Sr. initially was a member and the manager of the LLC, but he later transferred his membership interest to the other members and to a new member, 1000 Broadway LP. As a result, the interests between the entities controlling the two buildings intertwined: 1000 Broadway LP owned a 23.55 percent interest in Fox Tower, LLC.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-6\">3. <em>TMT Development, Sturgeon, and the role of Moyer Sr.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b762-7\">For many years, Moyer Sr. retained exclusive control over the management of his real estate and related enterprises. He was the president and director of 1000, Inc., as well as the trustee of the Tom Moyer Sr. Trust, and he thereby exercised control over 1000, Inc., 1000 LP, and 1000 Broadway LP (collectively, the \u201c1000 Entities\u201d). He also retained the title of manager of Fox Tower, LLC, after he transferred his interest in that LLC. In addition, the day-to-day operations for both 1000 Broadway Building and Fox Tower were delegated to another entity, TMT Development Co., Inc., (TMT Development), which was wholly owned by Moyer Sr.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-8\">Beginning in 2002, Moyer Sr.\u2019s granddaughter, Sturgeon, became involved in the management and operations of his real estate enterprises. In 2003, Sturgeon became the president of TMT Development, but Moyer Sr. remained personally involved in the management and operations of the buildings after that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-9\">4. <em>Transfers of funds among Moyer-related entities</em></p>\n<p id=\"b762-10\">While in control of his real estate entities, Moyer Sr. freely moved funds among those entities. Between 1999 and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"741\">*741</page-number>2002, Moyer Sr. directed 26 transfers of funds from 1000 Broadway LP to various recipients for purposes unrelated to the operations of the limited partnership, and there was no agreed-upon rate of interest to be included in the repayment of those transfers.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-4\">Between 2006 and 2009, eight additional transfers were made from 1000 Broadway LP for purposes other than operating the limited partnership. This second set of transfers was made to fund the development of another building in downtown Portland, Park Avenue West. A separate entity, West Park Avenue, LLC, had been created in conjunction with that project, but Fox Tower, LLC, wholly owned West Park Avenue, LLC, and separately held title to Park Avenue West. The eight transfers from 1000 Broadway LP for purposes of funding the Park Avenue West project totaled $14,074,822.21. Again, there was no agreed-upon rate of interest for repayment of those transfers by Fox Tower, LLC, or any other beneficiary of the funds.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-5\">5. <em>Transfer of control from Moyer Sr.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b763-6\">In the summer of 2010, Moyer Sr. was replaced by First Republic Trust Company (First Republic) as the successor trustee of the Tom Moyer Sr. Trust, thereby putting First Republic in control of the 1000 Entities. In November 2010, First Republic exercised that control to appoint Sturgeon as the sole director and president of 1000, Inc. Sturgeon was also appointed as the manager of Fox Tower, LLC.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-7\">B. <em>The Thrift Arbitration and Settlement</em></p>\n<p id=\"b763-8\">In December 2010, shortly after First Republic replaced Moyer Sr. and appointed Sturgeon to run 1000, Inc., Colleen M. Thrift and John H. Thrift, individually and as cotrustees of the Colleen M. Thrift Trust (claimants or \u201cthe Thrifts\u201d), initiated arbitration proceedings based on the trust\u2019s partnership interest in 1000 LP and membership interest in Fox Tower, LLC.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The claimants made <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"742\">*742</page-number>various allegations of mismanagement and improper financial transfers among Moyer-related entities. Because those arbitration proceedings and their resolution are central to the issues on appeal in this case, we recount them in some detail.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-3\">1. <em>The arbitration claims and 1000 Entities\u2019 motion to dismiss</em></p>\n<p id=\"b764-5\">The claimants\u2019 arbitration claims alleged that the diversion of funds from 1000 Broadway LP, through Fox Tower, LLC, to fund the development and construction of Park Avenue West was in breach of the respective partnership and operating agreements for those entities. The claimants also alleged that Sturgeon was managing the properties in violation of agreements among family members to retain nonfamily property management once Moyer Sr. was no longer actively involved in the operation and management of the 1000 Broadway Building and Fox Tower.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-6\">The claimants named, as respondents in the arbitration proceedings, many of the parties described above: the 1000 Entities, Fox Tower, LLC, Moyer Sr., Sturgeon, First Republic, and the other children\u2019s trusts. The claimants brought claims against some or all of the named respondents\u2014with the exception of the children\u2019s trusts\u2014for an accounting, constructive trust, breach of fiduciary duty, and breach of various written agreements.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-7\">The children\u2019s trusts were named as parties only because the claimants also brought claims for declaratory and injunctive relief, seeking the removal of 1000, Inc., as the general partner of 1000 LP and the removal of Sturgeon as the manager of Fox Tower, LLC. The arbitration claim states that the trusts \u201cwere and are limited partners of 1000 LP\u201d and \u201care named herein for the purpose of binding them to an order removing 1000, Inc., as the general partner of [1000 LP],\u201d and states the same with regard to the removal of Sturgeon.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-8\">In response to those claims, the 1000 Entities moved to dismiss on several grounds, including that the claims <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"743\">*743</page-number>were derivative in nature but were improperly brought as direct claims. Specifically, they argued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b765-3\">\u201cThe duties and claims alleged belong to the 1000 Entities, and not to the individual limited partners. Therefore, the claims only can be brought derivatively, on behalf of the entities. Because Claimants have failed to do so, their claims should be dismissed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b765-4\">Moreover, the 1000 Entities argued, the claimants had failed to allege the prerequisite to bringing derivative claims: that the claimants had demanded that the general partner bring the action on behalf of the limited partnership, or that such a demand would have been futile. <em>See </em>ORS 70.410 (\u201cIn a derivative action, the complaint shall set forth with particularity the effort of the plaintiff to secure initiation of the action by a general partner or the reasons for not making the effort.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b765-5\">The claimants, in response, did not directly engage with whether their claims were direct or derivative in nature. Instead, they argued that the arbitration clauses were broad enough to cover the disputes, so the 1000 Entities\u2019 \u201cprocedural\u201d arguments, which might apply in a court action, were not applicable. The claimants contended:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b765-6\">\u201cIn this case, where the plain language of the arbitration agreements and the surrounding circumstances so compellingly mandate arbitration of <em>this </em>dispute with all of <em>these </em>parties, the motions to dismiss should be denied * * *.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b765-7\">(Emphases in original.)</p>\n<p id=\"b765-8\">The arbitration panel denied the 1000 Entities\u2019 motions to dismiss, agreeing with the claimants regarding the breadth of the arbitration clause but also citing a statute that had not been raised in the claimants\u2019 response. The panel ruled:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b765-9\">\u201cEach of the motions to dismiss by the 1000 Entities is denied. The panel is unable to determine, as a matter of law, that no claim has been stated or that claimants lack standing. The panel does not apply derivative rules to this dispute in light of the broad language of the arbitration provisions and the language of ORS 67.160.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b766-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"744\">*744</page-number>The cited statute, ORS 67.160, authorizes a partner to \u201cmaintain an action against the partnership or another partner for legal or equitable relief, with or without an accounting as to partnership business,\u201d to enforce the partner\u2019s rights under the partnership agreement or enforce the partner\u2019s rights under ORS chapter 67. ORS 67.160(3)(a), (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b766-4\">2. <em>The settlement</em></p>\n<p id=\"b766-5\">The claimants ultimately settled their arbitration claims, and they entered into an agreement that included all of the named respondents\u2014with the notable exception of plaintiff in this case, the Timothy P. Moyer Trust.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The settlement provided, in part, that claimants\u2019 and the Tom Moyer Jr. Trust\u2019s membership interests in Fox Tower, LLC, and West Park Avenue, LLC, would be bought out for the sum of $10 million; that Fox Tower, LLC, would pay $15 million to 1000 Broadway LP, to be distributed to and by its members; that neither TMT Development, nor any member of the immediate or extended family of Moyer Sr., would be an officer or director of 1000, Inc., or manage any of the assets of the 1000 Entities; and First Republic would pay off a promissory note that had been created during the course of the arbitration. The agreement provided that the $10 million and $15 million payments from Fox Tower, LLC, were to be funded by an \u201cequity harvest\u201d from Fox Tower, LLC\u2014 that is, by a cash-out refinance of Fox Tower.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-6\">The settlement agreement included a paragraph that addressed \u201cRelease of Claims; Dismissal of Arbitration.\u201d That paragraph, which is later set out in full, 282 Or App at 754-57, provided for releases among the parties and stated that, \u201c[u]pon the effectiveness of releases contained in this paragraph, the Thrifts shall cause the dismissal of the [arbitration claims] with prejudice, and the Parties shall each bear their own share of the arbitration fees, costs and attorney fees.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b767-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"745\">*745</page-number>Plaintiff, as noted, was not a party to the settlement. In fact, during the negotiations, plaintiff had opposed any settlement that involved an equity harvest from Fox Tower, because it would encumber an asset of Fox Tower, LLC, to the detriment of the company\u2019s members, which included 1000 Broadway LP. Plaintiff also opposed any settlement that did not pay 1000 Broadway LP for accrued statutory interest on the unauthorized transfers\u2014a figure in the millions, by plaintiff\u2019s calculation.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-4\">Counsel for the 1000 Entities informed the chief arbitrator\u2019 by email that plaintiff was \u201cnot a party to this agreement\u201d but represented that, \u201cin light of [plaintiffs] statements that he makes no claims, supports no claims, and seeks limited involvement, we don\u2019t view his participation as necessary.\u201d Plaintiffs counsel, who had been copied on that email, replied that, although plaintiff \u201cmakes no claim in the proceeding, the trustee is supportive of the claims brought by the Thrifts on their merits.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The chief arbitrator then abated the proceedings pending the settlement; as part of that order, the chief arbitrator also stated, \u201cThe time by which respondents are to file any counterclaims or cross-claims, if any, is extended to November 7, 2011.\u201d Plaintiff did not file any counterclaims or cross-claims, and the arbitration proceedings were dismissed with prejudice in October 2011, after the refinancing closed on the Fox Tower.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-5\">C. <em>Current Proceedings</em></p>\n<p id=\"b767-6\">1. <em>Pleadings</em></p>\n<p id=\"b767-7\">Approximately seven months later, in May 2012, plaintiff commenced this action in circuit court, alleging claims based on the same circumstances that gave rise to the <em>arbitration\u2014i.e., </em>that 1000 Broadway LP and Fox Tower, LLC, had diverted funds from those entities to fund the development and construction of Park Avenue West. In the complaint, plaintiff acknowledges the payments made to 1000 Broadway LP in settlement of the arbitration claims <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"746\">*746</page-number>but alleges that those payments \u201cdid not fully compensate\u201d 1000 Broadway LP because the payments did not include interest that had accrued on the improper transfers.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-4\">To recover those additional amounts from the unauthorized transfers, plaintiff alleged multiple claims \u201cboth directly in his capacity as trustee of the Timothy P. Moyer Trust pursuant to ORS 67.160 and derivatively on behalf of [1000 Broadway LP and 1000 LP] pursuant to ORS 70.400 <em>et seq.\u201d </em>The claims against defendants included breach of partnership agreements, breach of fiduciary duty, conversion, money had and received, and requests for a constructive trust and an accounting.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b768-5\">Defendants, in response, moved to dismiss the complaint under ORCP 21 on various grounds. Ultimately, the trial court understood defendants\u2019 arguments to raise six issues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b768-6\">\u201c(1) that the settlement of the Thrift arbitration bars plaintiff\u2019s derivative claims because it was the settlement of a derivative claim binding on non-party limited shareholders; (2) that the 1000 Entities executed binding general releases of the defendants in this action in the Thrift arbitration settlement agreement; (3) that plaintiffs acceptance of the proceeds of a portion of the Thrift settlement bars his claims in this action; (4) that plaintiff has not sufficiently pleaded demand futility as required to assert a derivative claim ***; (5) that plaintiff failed to plead sufficient facts to establish a claim against defendant Vanessa Sturgeon for aiding and abetting a breach of fiduciary duty; and (6) that plaintiff cannot assert direct claims\u2014as opposed to derivative claims\u2014for the injuries alleged.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b769-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"747\">*747</page-number>Because the parties submitted evidence related to the Thrift arbitration and settlement, the court treated the motion to dismiss as a motion for summary judgment on the first three of the six issues. In a letter opinion, the court agreed with defendants on nearly every issue. The court first ruled that the previous arbitrations included derivative claims on behalf of 1000 Broadway LP, \u201cwhether characterized in that way or not, and the claims in this proceeding are derivative in nature, whether characterized as such or not.\u201d The court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b769-4\">\u201cThe arbitration claimants sought the recovery of allegedly unauthorized transfers from 1000 Broadway to fund the development of Fox Tower and Park Avenue West. The same claims have been asserted in this proceeding. The settlement of the arbitration claims included repayment to 1000 Broadway of all of the alleged improper transfers, and the dismissal of those claims with prejudice. <em>Plaintiff is therefore barred from retrying the claims in this proceeding due to the resolution of the prior claims with prejudice.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b769-5\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b769-6\">The trial court further explained that the \u201csettlement agreement also effectuates the same result.\u201d Among other contentions, plaintiff had argued that the agreement, in order to bind nonsettling limited partners like plaintiff, would have required \u201cprior court approval and notice of the settlement terms.\u201d The court rejected that argument and ruled that, in any event, plaintiff had received sufficient notice of the settlement but \u201cchose not to challenge the fairness of the settlement, accepted the proceeds of it, and now seeks to pursue the derivative claims a second time. Under these circumstances, fairness and due process were satisfied.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b769-7\">At the close of its letter opinion, the court clarified its ruling. It explained that it was granting defendants\u2019 motions on issues (1) (claim preclusion based on settlement of derivative claims in prior litigation) and (2) (effect of general releases by the 1000 Entities); that issue (3) (plaintiffs acceptance of proceeds from the settlement) was merely a factor that underscored the grant of summary judgment on the first two grounds; that issues (4) (demand futility) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"748\">*748</page-number>and (5) (aiding and abetting against Sturgeon) were moot as a result of the ruling on issues (1) and (2); and that issue (6) (that plaintiff could not assert direct claims for the injuries alleged to the limited partnership) was granted as a \u201ccorollary\u201d to the court\u2019s ruling on issues (1) and (2). The court then directed counsel for 1000 Broadway LP to prepare a judgment to that effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-4\">Subsequently, defendants filed motions for an award of attorney fees under ORS 70.415, which authorizes a discretionary award of attorney fees to the prevailing party in a derivative action involving a limited partnership. <em>See </em>ORS 70.415 (\u201cThe court <em>may </em>award reasonable attorney fees to the prevailing party in a derivative action.\u201d (Emphasis added.)). After a hearing on the motion and plaintiffs response, the court declined to award attorney fees. The court orally explained that, \u201cdespite the fact that I disagree with the plaintiffs positions that they took in this case, I think they were objectively reasonable and they were made in good faith. And a different judge could have come to a different conclusion. And I think the right thing for me to do is leave the parties where they are at this point, as opposed to shifting the fees to the plaintiff.\u201d The court entered an order consistent with that oral ruling. It then entered a general judgment in defendants\u2019 favor, awarding defendants costs and disbursements but not attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-5\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b770-6\">A. <em>Appeal</em></p>\n<p id=\"b770-7\">On appeal, plaintiff argues that the trial court erred with regard to each aspect of its ruling on summary judgment. We analyze, in turn, (1) whether claim preclusion, based on the dismissal of the prior arbitration, bars plaintiffs claims; (2) whether, as part of the settlement, 1000 Broadway LP and 1000 LP released claims against defendants; and (3) whether, in any event, plaintiff can assert direct claims against 1000, Inc.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-8\">1. <em>Claim preclusion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b770-9\">The predicate for the trial court\u2019s claim preclusion ruling, and for much of defendants\u2019 arguments, is that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"749\">*749</page-number>Thrift arbitration involved claims that were necessarily derivative claims. That is, the trial court ruled, as a matter of law, that the claims brought in the arbitration were brought by the Thrifts on behalf of 1000 Broadway LP; thus, the settlement of the arbitration and resulting judgment of dismissal of those proceedings preclude subsequent derivative claims based on the same factual transactions. According to plaintiff, that predicate is incorrect, because the arbitration claims were brought as \u201cdirect claims\u201d by the Thrifts individually and the arbitration panel understood them as such.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-4\">In reviewing the trial court\u2019s grant of summary judgment based on claim preclusion, we view the evidence in the light most favorable to plaintiff and consider whether the requirements for claim preclusion have been satisfied as a matter of law. <em>See Cornus Corp. v. Geac Enterprise Solutions, Inc., </em>252 Or App 595, 599, 289 P3d 267 (2012), <em>rev den, </em>353 Or 428, <em>cert den, </em>143 S Ct 421 (2013); <em>cf. Johnson &amp; Lechman-Su, PC v.

Thus, \u201c[t]he rule forecloses a party that has litigated a claim against another from further litigation on that same claim on any ground or theory of relief that the party could have litigated in the first instance.\u201d <em>Bloomfield v.

The Supreme Court \u201chas held that a person who was not a party to an earlier action but who was in \u2018privity\u2019 with a party to that earlier action also can be barred on claim preclusion grounds from bringing a second action.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 511. As the Supreme Court explained in <em>Bloomfield, </em>\u201c[a]n inherent limitation on using the concept of privity in such circumstances, however, is a concern about the fairness of binding a person to a judgment rendered in an earlier case in which he or she was not a party.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201c[P]rivity \u2018is merely a word used to say that the relationship between the one who is a party on the record and another is close enough to include the other within the <em>res judicata! </em>And that relationship is \u2018close enough\u2019 for purposes of preventing the third party from pursuing claims in a second trial \u2018only when it is realistic to say that the third party was fully protected in the first trial.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>(Quoting <em>Wolff v. Du Puis, </em>233 Or 317, 321-22, 378 P2d 707 (1963)).</p>\n<p id=\"b772-3\">In this case, plaintiff does not dispute that his complaint and the earlier arbitration are based on the same factual transactions; nor does he dispute that a final adjudication in an arbitration proceeding can have preclusive effect.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Thus, we understand the question to be whether this case and that arbitration involve the same <em>plaintiff. </em>That question, in turn, depends on whose interests were being represented in the arbitration\u2014an issue that the trial court understood to turn on whether the arbitration claims were, in fact, direct or derivative claims. The trial court ruled that the arbitration claims, \u201cwhether characterized in that way or not,\u201d were brought on behalf of 1000 Broadway LP rather than the Thrifts individually\u2014and that plaintiff cannot now bring identical claims on behalf of the same partnership.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-4\">In plaintiffs view, the trial court mischaracterized the arbitration claims as derivative considering that the 1000 Entities themselves characterized the claims as direct claims, and the arbitration panel declined to apply derivative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"751\">*751</page-number>rules to the claims, citing ORS 67.160\u2014a statute that refers to direct claims by a partner against a partnership or other partners. Thus, plaintiff argues, the Thrifts were representing their own interests, not those of 1000 Broadway LP and 1000 LP, when they litigated and settled their claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-4\">In response, defendants argue, as they did in the trial court, that the Thrifts\u2019 claims can <em>only </em>be characterized as derivative in nature, because the Thrifts did not allege any injuries that were distinct from injuries that the partnerships suffered. Relying on the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Caplener v. U.S. National Bank, </em>317 Or 506, 515, 857 P2d 830 (1993), defendants argue that the \u201ckey issue\u201d in distinguishing direct from derivative claims is \u201cwhether the claimed damages were derivative of, rather than distinct from, a breach of the agreement with the partnership.\u201d Viewed in that light, defendants argue, the claims in the arbitration were necessarily derivative claims brought in the right of the entities rather than the Thrifts individually.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-5\">Defendants\u2019 arguments, and the trial court\u2019s ultimate ruling, focus on how the Thrifts\u2019 claims <em>should </em>have been understood at the time of the arbitration. However, as we understand principles of claim preclusion, the question is not simply how the arbitration claims should have been characterized, but how they were <em>actually understood </em>by the parties and by the arbitration panel. As explained above, preclusion principles bar a person who was not a party to the earlier litigation \u201conly when it is realistic to say that the third party was fully protected in the first trial.\u201d <em>Bloomfield, </em>339 Or at 511 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b773-6\">Here, the summary judgment record does not conclusively establish that the interests of 1000 LP or 1000 Broadway LP were \u201cfully protected\u201d by the Thrifts during the prior arbitration. First, as plaintiff points out, the Thrifts never purported to bring their claims on behalf of those partnerships; the claims were alleged \u201cindividually and as Co-Trustees of the Colleen M. Thrift Trust.\u201d Moreover, the 1000 Entities moved to dismiss on the ground that, based on the injuries alleged, the Thrifts were required to bring the claims on behalf of the partnerships but had \u201cfailed to do so.\u201d Then, when the arbitration panel ruled on that motion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"752\">*752</page-number>to dismiss, it denied the 1000 Entities\u2019 standing arguments and declined to apply derivative rules, citing a statute, ORS 67.160, that refers to the right of a partner to \u201cmaintain an action against the partnership or another partner.\u201d ORS 67.160(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b774-4\">In addition, there is evidence in the record from which a trier of fact could infer that the Thrifts were willing to settle the arbitration claims only when they, <em>as individuals, </em>received a buyout of their interests in Fox Tower, LLC. And the settlement agreement itself, discussed in greater detail below, makes no reference to whether the claims were brought on behalf of the partnerships or belonged to the Thrifts individually, and it is ambiguous with respect to what claims were released by 1000 Broadway LP and 1000 LP. 282 Or App at 754-57.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-5\">That evidence, as a whole, creates factual questions as to whose interests the Thrifts, and the arbitration panel, understood the Thrifts to be representing during the arbitration proceeding. For that reason\u2014and regardless of whether, in hindsight, the claims should have been brought on behalf of the partnerships\u2014the summary judgment record does not conclusively establish that 1000 LP or 1000 Broadway LP were in \u201cprivity\u201d with the Thrifts such that those partnerships (or parties like plaintiff, seeking to bring claims on behalf of those partnerships) are now precluded by the dismissal of those proceedings from bringing additional claims based on the same set of operative facts. <em>See, e.g., Maxson v. Travis Cty. Rent Account, </em>21 SW3d 311, 317 (Tex App 1999) (at summary judgment stage, defendants failed to conclusively establish that the plaintiffs, who were limited partners, were in privity with other limited partners who had previously litigated against the defendants; \u201cno proof has been offered that the 1988 suit was initiated <em>on behalf of </em>the partnership or all limited partners\u201d (emphasis in original)).</p>\n<p id=\"b774-6\">Additionally, the 1000 Entities state that plaintiff was precluded \u201cbecause he was an actual party to the case.\u201d As set forth previously, 282 Or App at 742, plaintiff was named as a defendant in the arbitration, along with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"753\">*753</page-number>the other partners in 1000 LP, and only \u201cfor the purpose of binding them to an order removing 1000, Inc., as the general partner of [1000 LP].\u201d As we recently reiterated, \u201cin the absence of a compulsory-counterclaim rule, a party who is a defendant in one action is not barred by claim-preclusion principles from bringing a claim as a plaintiff in another action, <em>unless </em>the claim in the second action was necessarily adjudicated in the first action.\u201d <em>Federal Natl. Mortgage v. United States of America, </em>279 Or App 411, 416, 380 P3d 1186 (2016) (emphasis in original). Here, defendants have not established that plaintiff was compelled to assert a counterclaim in the arbitration proceeding; although the chief arbitrator set a deadline for filing counterclaims or cross-claims, defendants have not explained how that deadline compelled plaintiff to file those claims for purposes of claim preclusion. Nor have defendants established that any of the legal or factual issues in this case were \u201cnecessarily adjudicated\u201d\u2014 <em>i.e., </em>actually adjudicated and essential to the determination of the arbitration proceeding. <em>See Ram Technical Services, Inc. v. Koresko, </em>240 Or App 620, 632, 247 P3d 1251 (2011) (explaining that the \u201cnecessarily adjudicated\u201d exception \u201capplies when the factual and legal issues that the plaintiff raises in the second case were <em>actually </em>adjudicated and essential to the determination of the first case\u201d (emphasis added)). Thus, the fact that plaintiff was a <em>defendant </em>in the arbitration is not sufficient to establish claim preclusion on this record.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-4\">2. <em>Settlement bar (derivative claimsj</em></p>\n<p id=\"b775-5\">a. The release provision</p>\n<p id=\"b775-6\">As described above, the trial court also agreed with defendants\u2019 argument that plaintiff\u2019s derivative claims against each of the defendants was barred by the release provision in the arbitration settlement. On appeal, we understand plaintiff to challenge that conclusion on two grounds. First, he argues that the settlement was never intended to release claims by 1000 Broadway LP or 1000 LP against defendants; rather, it was intended to release only claims by 1000 Broadway LP or 1000 LP against the Thrifts and Tom Moyer Jr. Second, plaintiff argues that, even assuming that the settlement was intended to bar the type of claims <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"754\">*754</page-number>he now asserts, the agreement is unenforceable against him because it was collusive and procured without notice to him, opportunity to be heard, and approval by the arbitration panel or a court. We conclude that plaintiffs first contention presents a factual question that precludes summary judgment; accordingly, we do not address his alternative arguments regarding enforceability.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-4\">We begin with the scope and effect of the release agreement. In construing a release agreement, we follow ordinary rules of contract interpretation. <em>See Ristau v. Wescold, Inc., </em>318 Or 383, 387, 868 P2d 1331 (1994) (\u201cA release agreement is a contract subject to the rules of contract construction and interpretation.\u201d). \u201cThe first inquiry that a court makes is whether the agreement is ambiguous. In the absence of an ambiguity, the court construes the words of a contract as a matter of law.\u201d <em>Couch Investments, LLC v. Peverieri, </em>359 Or 125, 132, 371 P3d 1202 (2016) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b776-5\">To determine whether a provision of a contract is ambiguous, we examine the text of the provision in the context of the document as a whole; we also look to extrinsic evidence of the circumstances underlying the contract\u2019s formation. <em>See Batzer Construction, Inc. v. Boyer, </em>204 Or App 309, 317, 129 P3d 773, <em>rev den, </em>341 Or 366 (2006). \u201cA contract provision is ambiguous if it has no definite significance or if it is capable of more than one sensible and reasonable interpretation [.] \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 313 (quoting <em>Deerfield Commodities v. Nerco, Inc., </em>72 Or App 305, 317, 696 P2d 1096, <em>rev den, </em>299 Or 314 (1985)). \u201cAs a general rule, summary judgment is not appropriate in a contract dispute if the terms are ambiguous.\u201d <em>Copeland Sand &amp; Gravel v. Estate of Angeline Dillard, </em>267 Or App 791, 797, 341 P3d 187 (2014), <em>adh\u2019d to on recons, </em>269 Or App 904, 346 P3d 526 (2015).</p>\n<p id=\"b776-6\">Before turning to the text and context of the arbitration settlement, we briefly recap the circumstances that gave rise to the settlement. In short, the arbitration involved claims brought by the trustees of the Colleen M. Thrift Trust, which is a limited partner in 1000 LP and was a member of Fox Tower, LLC, against Moyer Sr., Vanessa Sturgeon, First Republic Trust, and various Moyer-related <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"755\">*755</page-number>entities. The dispute focused on mismanagement by Moyer Sr. and Sturgeon, and the gravamen of the claims was that they had breached fiduciary duties and the partnership and LLC agreements by using the funds of 1000 Broadway LP and Fox Tower, LLC, for other development projects, including the Park Avenue West project; the claimants specifically identified \u201cunauthorized\u201d transfers from 1000 Broadway LP in 1999 to 2002 and 2006 to 2009. The parties to the arbitration proceedings\u2014with the notable exception of plaintiff\u2014negotiated a settlement that resulted in dismissal of the arbitration claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-4\">That settlement agreement included the following provision, paragraph 6:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b777-5\">\u201c6. Release of Claims; Dismissal of Arbitration. Upon payment of the moneys described in paragraph 2 above[<footnotemark>9</footnotemark>] and delivery of the Note, the Thrifts shall cause the dismissal of the ASP Claim and the AAA Claim with prejudice, <em>and the Thrifts, Thomas Peter Moyer, the trustees of the Tom Moyer, Jr. Trust, and the trustees of the Kimberly A.

Upon the effectiveness of the foregoing release by the Thrifts and the Tom Moyer, Jr. Trust, FRTC, Tom Moyer Theatres, TMT Development Co., Inc., Fox Tower, LLC, <em>1000 Broadway, 1000 LP, 1000[, Inc.], </em>and Sturgeon <em>on behalf of themselves, their heirs, and agents and assigns, shall be deemed to have fully and forever released and discharged the Thrifts and the Tom Moyer, Jr. Trust, and all of their predecessors, successors, partners, partners of partners, assigns, agents, officers, directors, employees, insurers, attorneys, affiliates and representatives, and all others for whom those persons and entities might be claimed to be liable, or who might be claimed to be liable for those persons and entities, of and from any and all claims, liens, demands, actions, causes of action, suits or causes of suit of every nature whatsoever, directly or indirectly arising out of, relating to, or connected with any and all acts and/or omissions by any released person or entity based upon facts or events that have occurred, whether known or unknown, to the present date, whether actual or alleged, known or unknown, including but not limited to all claims, liens, demands, actions, causes of action, suits or causes of suit directly or indirectly arising out of, relating to, or connected with the ASP Claim and the AAA Claim. </em>The above release by FRTC shall not affect the right of FRTC to carry out the ordinary administration of the Thomas A. Moyer Revocable Living Trust u/a/d 7/25/07, nor shall that release apply to the beneficiaries of that trust pursuant to ORS 130.110. The rights <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"757\">*757</page-number>of Kimberly Moyer and Timothy Moyer as beneficiaries of that trust shall not be affected by the release by FRTC. Upon the effectiveness of releases contained in this paragraph, the Thrifts shall cause the dismissal of the ASP Claim and the AAA Claim with prejudice, and the Parties shall each bear their own share of the arbitration fees, costs and attorney fees.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b779-4\">(Boldface in original; emphases added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b779-5\">There are several notable features of paragraph 6. First, as a matter of structure, the paragraph actually includes two distinct \u201creleases.\u201d Stated broadly, one addresses the release of claims by three of the children\u2019s trusts (the \u201csettling children\u201d); the other addresses the release of claims by the other various Moyer-related individuals and entities (\u201cthe Moyer defendants\u201d), which include 1000 Broadway LP and 1000 LP.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-6\">Second, those two releases are structured similarly but not identically. The release by the settling children begins by releasing claims against \u201ceach <em>other\u201d\u2014i.e., </em>claims by one of the settling children against another of the settling children\u2014before releasing claims against the Moyer defendants. The release by the Moyer defendants, however, does not include that same text releasing \u201ceach other.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b779-7\">Third, after identifying the specific parties who are released, both of the respective releases contain extremely broad recitations of related individuals and entities who are likewise intended to be covered by the releases. The release by the settling children extends to the named Moyer defendants as well as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b779-8\">\u201call of their predecessors, successors, members, partners, partners of partners, assigns, agents, officers, directors, employees, insurers, attorneys, affiliates and representatives, and all others for whom those persons and entities might be claimed to be liable, or who might be claimed to be liable for those persons and entities!.]\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b779-9\">The release by the Moyer defendants includes identical language, with the exception of any reference to \u201cmembers.\u201d It releases \u201cthe Thrifts and the Tom Moyer, Jr. Trust\u201d and</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b780-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"758\">*758</page-number>\u201call of their predecessors, successors, partners, partners of partners, assigns, agents, officers, directors, employees, insurers, attorneys, affiliates and representatives, and all others for whom those persons and entities might be claimed to be liable, or who might be claimed to be liable for those persons and entities [.] \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b780-4\">Fourth, both of the releases are extremely broad with regard to the types of claims covered by the release. They include</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b780-5\">\u201cany and all claims, liens, demands, actions, causes of action, suits or causes of suit of every nature whatsoever, directly or indirectly arising out of, relating to, or connected with any and all acts and/or omissions by any released person or entity based upon facts or events that have occurred, whether known or unknown, to the present date, whether actual or alleged, known or unknown, including but not limited to all claims, liens, demands, actions, causes of action, suits or causes of suit directly or indirectly arising out of, relating to, or connected with the ASP Claim and the AAA Claim.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b780-6\">Keeping those four features of paragraph 6 in mind, we return to the question before us: whether, as part of the arbitration settlement, 1000 LP or 1000 Broadway LP released the same claims that plaintiffs complaint now asserts on their behalf.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> For reasons that will become apparent, we distinguish between plaintiffs claims against defendant 1000, Inc., and claims asserted against the remaining defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-7\">b. Release of claims against 1000, Inc.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-8\">Plaintiffs complaint alleges a number of derivative claims against 1000, Inc., the general partner that controlled 1000 LP. According to 1000, Inc., plaintiffs derivative claims against it are barred by paragraph 6 because 1000 LP and 1000 Broadway LP released any claims against \u201cpartners\u201d of the Thrifts and the Tom Moyer Jr. Trust, and it is beyond <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"759\">*759</page-number>dispute that the Colleen M. Thrift Trust and the Tom Moyer Jr. Trust were limited partners in 1000 LP. Plaintiff, on the other hand, argues that the reference to \u201cpartners\u201d and \u201cpartners of partners\u201d in paragraph 6 was added by counsel for the Thrifts and the Tom Moyer Jr. Trust, and was never intended to secure the release of 1000, Inc.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-4\">1000, Inc.\u2019s understanding of the text of the settlement is certainly plausible. The arbitration involved claims by a limited partner of 1000 LP against their general partner, 1000, Inc. In that context, the word \u201cpartners\u201d might naturally encompass 1000, Inc., which indisputably is one of the Thrifts\u2019 and the Tom Moyer Jr. Trust\u2019s partners in 1000 LP. However, extrinsic evidence of the circumstances of formation, as well as the broader context of paragraph 6, persuade us that the agreement is ambiguous as to whether the reference to \u201cpartners\u201d or \u201cpartners of partners\u201d was intended to include 1000, Inc.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-5\">First, as plaintiff points out, to read \u201cpartners\u201d as including 1000, Inc., would produce a curious result: 1000, Inc., would be releasing claims against itself. That is, the agreement provides that all of the 1000 Entities\u2014including 1000, Inc.\u2014release the \u201cpartners\u201d of the Thrifts and the Tom Moyer Jr. Trust. Thus, 1000, Inc., would appear on both sides of the release, giving up claims against itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-6\">Although that result might simply be a drafting quirk, the structure of the agreement suggests otherwise. The parties understood how to draft a release among parties who were aligned with one another in the arbitration. With regard to the Thrifts, Thomas Peter Moyer, the trustees of the Tom Moyer Jr. Trust, and the trustees of the Kimberly Moyer Kassab Trust, the release provides that they are deemed to have \u201cfully and forever released and discharged <em>each other!\u2019 </em>That is, rather than relying on the \u201cpartners\u201d or \u201cpartners of partners\u201d reference that appears in the release, the parties explicitly referred to a release among the other partners of 1000 LP.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-7\">Plaintiff also produced extrinsic evidence that counsel for the Thrifts and the Tom Moyer Jr. Trust was responsible for adding the \u201cpartners\u201d and \u201cpartners of partners\u201d text <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"760\">*760</page-number>to the agreement. Considering that the Thrifts and the Tom Moyer Jr. Trust were litigating against 1000, Inc., and its president, Sturgeon, it seems improbable that the reference to \u201cpartners\u201d was intended and understood to release claims that the 1000 Entities might bring against one another, when the agreement otherwise omitted any reference to a release by the defendants of claims against \u201ceach other.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b782-4\">Because the release provision is ambiguous with regard to whether 1000 LP and 1000 Broadway LP released claims against 1000, Inc., when settling the Thrifts\u2019 claims, the trial court erred in granting summary judgment on that ground. <em>See Adair Homes, Inc. v. Dunn Carney, </em>262 Or App 273, 286-87, 325 P3d 49, <em>rev den, </em>355 Or 879 (2014) (where, as in this case, the agreement is ambiguous and there is disputed extrinsic evidence relevant to that ambiguity, summary judgment is improper).</p>\n<p id=\"b782-5\">c. Release of other defendants</p>\n<p id=\"b782-6\">None of the remaining defendants point to any text in the settlement agreement that releases claims by 1000 LP or 1000 Broadway LP against them. Nor is it apparent from the text how any of them come within the scope of the release by 1000 LP and 1000 Broadway LP. None of them are \u201cpartners\u201d or \u201cpartners of partners\u201d of the Thrifts or the Tom Moyer Jr. Trust; the only other reference that could arguably encompass those defendants is the reference to \u201caffiliates\u201d of the Thrifts or the Tom Moyer Jr. Trust. However, the term \u201caffiliate,\u201d as used in this context, commonly refers to \u201ca company effectively controlled by another or associated with others under common ownership or control,\u201d or a \u201csubsidiary.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <em>Webster\u2019s Third New Int\u2019l Dictionary </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"761\">*761</page-number>35 (unabridged ed 2002). It is not an unambiguous reference to any of the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-3\">In sum, the release provision manifests an unambiguous intent to release claims that the 1000 Entities might bring against the Thrifts and the Tom Moyer Jr. Trust. It does not manifest that same unambiguous intent to release claims that the 1000 Entities might bring against one another or against the other defendants in this action. Accordingly, the trial court erred in granting summary judgment based on the release provision.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b783-4\">3. <em>Direct claims: No right to pursue an injury to the partnership</em></p>\n<p id=\"b783-6\">We turn next to the trial court\u2019s ruling that plaintiff failed to state cognizable <em>direct </em>claims as a limited partner against 1000, Inc., 1000 LP\u2019s general partner, for breach of contract and breach of fiduciary duty.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The parties\u2019 arguments on this question implicate many of the same competing theories that they advanced about the nature of the arbitration claims, but without the overlay of claim preclusion: 1000, Inc., argues that, under established principles of entity law, \u201ca partner cannot convert a derivative claim to a direct claim simply by dropping back to allege <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"762\">*762</page-number>that partner\u2019s pro-rata share of the overall harm.\u201d Plaintiff, for his part, argues that Oregon\u2019s partnership statutes allow him to bring direct claims in addition to derivative claims. The court implicitly agreed with 1000, Inc.\u2019s argument. We likewise agree with 1000, Inc., insofar as plaintiff alleged injuries that are entirely derivative of injuries to 1000 LP and 1000 Broadway LP.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-4\">Oregon, like many states, has adopted the Revised Uniform Limited Partnership Act (RULPA). The RULPA, which was adopted in 1985, explicitly authorizes limited partners to bring derivative claims. ORS 70.400 provides that \u201c[a] limited partner <em>may </em>bring an action in the right of a limited partnership to recover a judgment in its favor if general partners with authority to do so have refused to bring the action or if an effort to cause those general partners to bring the action is not likely to succeed.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Plaintiff, seizing on the word \u201cmay,\u201d argues that the statute is therefore permissive with regard to alleging a claim as direct or derivative:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b784-5\">\u201cUnder ORS 70.400, a limited partner \u2018may\u2019 bring a derivative action. He is not required to. And under ORS 67.160(2), a partner is specifically entitled to \u2018maintain an action against a partner for breach of the partnership agreement or for a violation of a duty to the partnership or other partners * * *.\u2019 Plaintiff is statutorily entitled to bring his direct claims against 1000, Inc.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b784-6\">We disagree with plaintiffs understanding of the word \u201cmay.\u201d As used in ORS 70.400, the word is employed only to create the authority for limited partners to act in the right of the partnership\u2014something that is typically reserved for general partners. <em>See Doyle v. City of Medford, </em>347 Or 564, 570-71, 227 P3d 683 (2010) (In general, \u201cthe word \u2018shall\u2019 implies that the legislature intended to create an obligation; in contrast, \u2018may\u2019 generally implies that the legislature intended to create only the authority to act.\u201d). There is no indication in the text, context, or legislative history of that statute to suggest that the legislature understood the word \u201cmay\u201d to be permissive in the sense that a limited partner could choose whether to bring the claim directly or derivatively.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"763\">*763</page-number>To the contrary, principles of entity law, which were well established by the time that the RUPLA was adopted, have distinguished between claims that must be brought derivatively and claims that must be brought directly. The Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Caplener, </em>although post-dating the enactment of the RULPA, is illustrative. In <em>Caplener, </em>the court considered whether individual partners could state breach of contract claims against a bank for damages that resulted from the bank\u2019s breach of an oral promise to lend money to the partnership. The court began its analysis with a discussion of an earlier case, <em>Johnston v. The Oregon Bank, </em>285 Or 423, 591 P2d 746 (1979), which the parties agreed was \u201con point as to whether the individual partners stated contract claims against Bank.\u201d <em>Caplener, </em>317 Or at 513. In <em>Johnston, </em>the plaintiff was the principal shareholder in a corporation that, in turn, was the general partner of a lumber company. The plaintiff had claimed that his credit and business standing had been injured, his partnership interest devalued, his partnership wages reduced, and his liability and expenses increased, all as a result of the defendant bank\u2019s actions in driving the partnership into bankruptcy. In describing the holding of <em>Johnston, Caplener </em>quoted the following excerpt from that opinion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b785-4\">\u2018\u201cThe damages would have occurred to plaintiff just the same in the absence of any guaranty. The damage to plaintiff resulted from plaintiff\u2019s interest in the lumber company as well as his contractual relations with other creditors and from the lumber company\u2019s bankruptcy and inability to pay its obligations, which bankruptcy was, in turn, caused by the bank\u2019s breach of its agreement with the lumber company. Plaintiff\u2019s injury either was derivative through his interest in the lumber company or was the result of business relations with others for the lumber company\u2019s benefit. It was not the result of his guaranty to the bank.\u2019\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b785-6\">317 Or at 514 (quoting <em>Johnston, </em>285 Or at 427).</p>\n<p id=\"b785-7\">The parties in <em>Caplener </em>disagreed as to whether the plaintiff-partners were more analogous to the shareholder in <em>Johnston </em>or to a plaintiff-guarantor that had been allowed to proceed with a personal claim against a lender in a Court of Appeals decision, <em>Van Petten v. The Oregon Bank, </em>42 Or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"764\">*764</page-number>App 367, 600 P2d 507, <em>rev den, </em>288 Or 173 (1979). The court in <em>Caplener </em>concluded that it was unnecessary to determine whether <em>Van Petten </em>had been correctly decided by this court, because <em>Johnston </em>was dispositive:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b786-4\">\u201cFrom the above-quoted passage in <em>Johnston, </em>it is apparent that the key issue is not whether the claim is by a corporation, a shareholder, or a partner, but whether the claimed damages were derivative of, rather than distinct from, a breach of the agreement with the borrowing corporation or partnership. <em>See Weiss v. Northwest Accept. Corp., </em>274 Or 343, 350, 546 P2d 1065 (1976) (shareholder who guaranteed loan stated no claim against the defendant corporation where injury suffered by shareholder was the same as that suffered by other creditors of the corporation).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b786-5\">317 Or at 515. The court further explained, \u201cWe agree with the trial court\u2019s conclusion that the damages alleged by the individuals are derivative of the damages to the partnership. Those damages were the result of plaintiffs\u2019 interest in the partnership.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The partnership, the court held, \u201cis the real party in interest in this case and no individual partner has any separate legally cognizable interest.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 515-16.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-6\">As plaintiff points out, <em>Caplener </em>involved a claim against a third party, whereas his claims are for breach of contractual and fiduciary duties owed by the general partner, 1000, Inc., to its limited partners. We acknowledge that difference, but we are not persuaded that the principle articulated in <em>Caplener </em>should be understood so narrowly. That principle was drawn from cases like <em>Weiss </em>and <em>Smith v. Bramwell, </em>146 Or 611, 31 P2d 647 (1934), which are based on the \u201cseparateness of the corporate entity and its stockholders.\u201d <em>Weiss, </em>274 Or at 348. In <em>Smith, </em>the court explained that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b786-7\">\u201c [i]t is a well-established general rule that a stockholder of a corporation has no personal right of action against directors or officers who have defrauded or mismanaged it and thus affected the value of his stock. The wrong is against the corporation and the cause of action belongs to it. Any judgment obtained by reason of such wrongs is an asset of the corporation which inures first to the benefit of creditors and secondly to stockholders.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b787-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"765\">*765</page-number>146 Or at 615. The court reached that conclusion notwithstanding the fact that the plaintiff had relied on the breach of a voting trust agreement; the court explained that \u201ca breach of this voting agreement did not confer upon the plaintiff a right to an individual and direct action, as distinguished from a derivative one, as any loss sustained by plaintiff by reason of the breach was, under the facts alleged, common to all stockholders.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 619. <em>See also Loewen v. Galligan, </em>130 Or App 222, 229-30, 873 P2d 1102, <em>rev den, </em>320 Or 493 (1994) (\u201cA wrongful act that diminishes the value of stock and thereby injures shareholders only indirectly, by reason of the prior injury to the corporation, is derivative. Because plaintiffs have not pleaded a special injury, we conclude that the claims they allege are derivative, and they do not have standing to bring direct claims for breach of fiduciary duty.\u201d (Internal quotation marks and citations omitted.)).</p>\n<p id=\"b787-3\">The principles traced in <em>Caplener, </em>although originating in corporation law, are applicable to derivative actions by limited partners, who are analogous to shareholders in relevant respects. <em>Brooke v. Mt. Hood Meadows Oreg., Ltd., </em>81 Or App 387, 393, 725 P2d 925 (1986), <em>adh\u2019d to on recons, </em>83 Or App 358, 732 P2d 36 (1987) (describing earlier version of Oregon\u2019s limited partnership act and recognizing that <em>\u201c[a] </em>limited partner\u2019s position is analogous to that of a corporate shareholder, whose role is that of an investor with limited liability * * * with no voice in the operation of the enterprise\u201d); <em>see also </em>ORS 70.135(1) (providing that a limited partner is not liable for the obligations of the partnership unless the limited partner is also a general partner or participates in control of the business); ORS 67.050(1) (\u201cA partnership is an entity distinct from its partners.\u201d). Indeed, the majority of courts that have confronted the issue have applied a test similar to that in <em>Caplener </em>to determine whether a claim must be brought directly or derivatively:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b787-4\">\u201cLimited partners may, of course, enforce their individual rights when these can be distinguished from partnership rights. The prevailing criterion is whether the claimed injury is primarily to the partnership and only indirectly to the partners through their interest in the partnership\u2014a partnership claim\u2014or is direct or unique to the partner(s)\u2014an individual claim.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b788-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"766\">*766</page-number>Alan R. Bromberg and Larry E. Ribstein, IV <em>Bromberg and Ribstein on Partnership, </em>\u00a7 15.04(f) (Supp 2009-1) (footnotes omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b788-4\">Given that broader context, we are not persuaded by plaintiffs contention that ORS 70.400 allows him to allege the same claims\u2014for breach of fiduciary duty and breach of contract by a general partner, resulting in damages to the partnership\u2014as both direct and derivative claims. To the extent that a claim can be brought in the right of the partnership under ORS 70.400, the plaintiff must pursue that claim as a derivative action rather than as a direct claim for the limited partner\u2019s <em>pro rata </em>share of the damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-5\">Consequently, plaintiffs reliance on ORS 67.160 is misplaced. That statute, which is part of the Revised Uniform Partnership Act (RUPA) adopted in 1997, applies to limited partnerships only as a gap-filling statute. <em>See </em>ORS 70.615 (\u201cIn any case governing limited partnerships that is not provided for in this chapter, the provisions of ORS chapter 67 govern.\u201d).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Because ORS 70.400 governs the claims in this case, which are derivative in nature, this is not a case that is \u201cnot provided for\u201d in ORS chapter 70.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-6\">Thus, we conclude that plaintiffs claims for breach of contract and breach of fiduciary duty against 1000, Inc., are properly characterized as claims in the right of the partnership, and the trial court correctly ruled that plaintiff had failed to state a cognizable direct claim for relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-7\">B. <em>Cross-appeal</em></p>\n<p id=\"b788-8\">Finally, we briefly address defendants\u2019 cross-appeal, in which they contend that the trial court erroneously denied their request for attorney fees as the prevailing party in a derivative action under ORS 70.415. As a result of our decision on appeal, which reverses the grant of summary judgment on plaintiffs derivative claims, defendants are not presently the prevailing parties. Accordingly, the issues raised on cross-appeal are moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"767\">*767</page-number>On appeal, reversed and remanded as to derivative claims; otherwise affirmed.

It is not clear whether those arguments present independent and alternative bases for affirming the judgment, or whether they depend on defendants\u2019 argument that 1000 Broadway LP released claims against West Park Avenue, LLC, Fox Tower, LLC, and the other defendants. Because they have not been clearly presented as alternative bases for upholding the judgment, we do not address them separately. Similarly, we note that defendants advanced additional arguments below in support of their motions for summary judgment on the derivative claims, including contentions that the trial court concluded were \u201cmoot\u201d based on its reasoning. Because none of those issues are developed on appeal as alternative bases for affirming the court\u2019s judgment regarding the derivative claims, we express no opinion on issues beyond claim preclusion and the effect of the settlement agreement with regard to those claims.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b783-8\"> Plaintiff\u2019s complaint does not clearly delineate which of the claims are brought individually, so we operate under the assumption, as do the parties, that his only direct claims are for breach of contract and breach of fiduciary duty against 1000, Inc.
