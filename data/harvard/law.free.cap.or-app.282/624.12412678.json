In April 2016, the court asserted jurisdiction over S based on the new allegation.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-5\">On appeal, father challenges the 2016 jurisdictional judgment, arguing that the court erred in asserting jurisdiction over S in the absence of expert testimony that custody of S by father was likely to result in serious emotional or physical damage to S, as required by the Indian Child Welfare Act (ICWA), 25 USC \u00a7 1912(e). Father did not preserve his argument below; however, he contends that he was not required to do so under 25 USC section 1914.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-6\">DHS, in turn, argues that the resolution of this case depends on whether the proceeding at issue constituted a \u201cfoster care placement\u201d under 25 USC section 1903(1)(i). If it did, father was exempt from the preservation requirement and DHS was required to present expert testimony. However, DHS contends that the jurisdictional hearing was not a \u201cfoster care placement.\u201d Thus, according to DHS, father was required to preserve his claim and DHS was not required to present expert testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-7\">We agree with DHS that the resolution of this case turns on whether the proceeding in this case was a \u201cfoster care placement.\u201d Further, we conclude that the relevant proceedings did not constitute a \u201cfoster care placement\u201d within the meaning of ICWA, because S had already been removed from father\u2019s care in the earlier proceeding and, thus, the \u201csignificant shift in legal rights\u201d that occurs when the court first asserts jurisdiction was not present in this case. <em>See Dept. of Human Services v.
