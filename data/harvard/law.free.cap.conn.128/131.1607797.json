He alleged the assignment had been made by \u201cmistake, erroneous misunderstanding and advice of counsel,\u201d and without consideration. The trial court correctly found that the plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>tiff introduced no evidence in support of his demand that the assignment be set aside, and that there was no evidence offered that the mortgage indebtedness was due and unpaid. It further found that the assignment was made upon adequate consideration, the transfer to the plaintiff by these two defendants of certain real estate, and that there was no fraud connected with the transaction. It is implicit in the finding that there was no mistake. The entire evidence is before us in connection with assignments of error in relation to the finding. We cannot make such changes as will materially strengthen the plaintiff\u2019s claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">. These conclusions make it unnecessary to discuss additional considerations entering into the trial court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-6\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
