J.</author>\n<p id=\"Axf\">The plaintiff brought this action to recover from the defendant expenses incurred for the support of Mrs. Georgiana Reynolds and her children, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>under the provisions of General Statutes, Cum. Sup. 1935, \u00a7 663c, quoted, so far as material in this case, to the footnote,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> on the ground that their settlement was in the defendant town. The defendant conceded that until August 26, 1928, the Reynolds family did have a settlement in it, but it claimed that thereafter they acquired a settlement in the town of Colebrook; also that the facts did not bring the family within the class of persons for the support of which another town than that in which they actually lived was liable; and that the notice given to it did not meet the requirements of the statute. The court overruled these claims and gave judgment for the plaintiff, from which the defendant has appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">On August 26, 1928, Mrs. Reynolds\u2019 husband, with his family, moved to the town of Colebrook to take a position as resident manager of a farm there. From that time until September, 1936, they continued to live in Colebrook on the farm except for two intervals, one of five months and one of about a year, when the husband lost his position as resident manager of the farm and the family moved to Winsted in the plaintiff town and lived there. After September, 1936, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>the family again lived in Winsted and then returned to another farm in Colebrook, where they resided some three months. In April, 1937, the family moved once more to Winsted and thereafter did not return to Cole-brook. Between the first removal to Colebrook and the time when the family left that town, they did not live there continuously for any period of four years. The claim of the defendant is, however, that the removals to Winsted did not interrupt the continuity of the residence in Colebrook. The trial court has found that during each of the periods that the family resided in Winsted, Reynolds intended to make that his place of permanent residence, with no intention of moving or residing elsewhere but ready to take a job wherever he could get one. The defendant sought to strike out this finding and to have inserted in place of it one that, when Reynolds left Colebrook he intended to reside away from that town only temporarily and until he secured farm work or a residence in Colebrook. The most favorable construction in support of the claim of the defendant that can be given to the evidence, is that Reynolds did not intend to reside permanently in Winsted if he could find work on a farm in some other place, and that he always hoped to be re-employed by the owner of the farm in Colebrook where he had been resident manager.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-6\">Reynolds, in order to have acquired a settlement in Colebrook, must have \u201cresided . . . four years continuously\u201d in that town. General Statutes, Cum. Sup. 1935, \u00a7 662c; Cum. Sup. 1939, \u00a7 558e. The word \u201cresided\u201d as used in this statute requires that one must have had a \u201c \u2018fixed, permanent, established residence or home,' \u201d an \u201cactual and not merely constructive residence\u201d; that the person in question must have been an actual resident, \u201c \u2018even though he have a technical domicil elsewhere\u2019 \u201d; <em>Washington </em>v. <em>Warren, </em>123 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>Conn. 268, 271, 273, 193 Atl. 751; and the statute requires that this residence must have been continuous for the four-year period. <em>Chaplin </em>v. <em>Bloomfield, </em>92 Conn. 395, 397, 103 Atl. 118. Its continuance would not be interrupted by temporary absences, so long as there was an intent to return to the town, and the pauper still regarded it as his home or permanent dwelling place. <em>Salem </em>v. <em>Lyme, </em>29 Conn. 74, 80. There is in <em>Plainville </em>v. <em>Milford, </em>119 Conn. 380, 390, 177 Atl. 138, language suggesting that absences will not break the continuity of the residence necessary to acquire a settlement unless they are accompanied by an intent to abandon the residence which has been begun, but a consideration of the requirement in the statute that residence must be continuous effectively shows that this cannot be so, and it is so held in <em>Fairfield </em>v. <em>Easton, </em>73 Conn. 735, 739, 49 Atl. 200. Where one leaves the town in which he is living and it ceases to be in fact his permanent dwelling place or home, the continuity of the residence necessary to acquire a settlement is broken. <em>Newtown </em>v. <em>Southbury, </em>100 Conn. 251, 253, 123 Atl. 278; <em>Washington </em>v. <em>Warren, </em>supra, 272. The trial court was not in error in holding that the Reynolds family had not acquired a settlement in the town of Colebrook.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-6\">The first sentence of the statute, under which this case is brought, provides that when a person not an inhabitant of the town in which he resides \u201cshall become poor and unable to support himself,\u201d the selectmen of the town shall furnish him necessary support, while the second sentence provides that the selectmen of the town furnishing support to \u201ca pauper belonging to another town\u201d shall give notice of his condition to the town to which \u201csuch pauper\u201d belongs. The defendant contends that the obligation of the town to which the person belongs to reimburse the town fur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>nishing the support is more restricted than the duty imposed upon the selectmen by the first sentence, to furnish support, because of the use of the word \u201cpauper\u201d in the second sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-6\">In Professor Capen\u2019s book \u201cConnecticut Poor Law,\u201d the early development of our statutes for the relief of the needy is traced in detail, and it suffices now to refer only to a few outstanding laws. In 1673 the General Court passed an act which provided that every town should maintain its own \u201cpoor,\u201d and this duty extended to any person remaining three months within the town who \u201ccomes to want relief\u201d unless ordered to leave. Laws of 1673, p. 57. In 1789 it was provided that every town should support its own inhabitants \u201cwho may need relief\u201d whether living in that town or any other and any town which had incurred expense in supporting an inhabitant of another might recover it in an action against the town to which he belonged. Laws of 1789, p. 386. In 1818 an act was passed which provided in the first section that whenever any person \u201cshall become poor, and unable to support and provide for him, or herself at any town other than that to which he or she belongs, or in which such pauper, or paupers statedly reside,\u201d it was the duty of the person at whose house such \u201cpoor person\u201d might be to notify one of the selectmen of the town and the town to which such \u201cpoor person\u201d belonged would not be liable for any support furnished before the notice was given; and in the second section it was made the duty of the selectmen whenever a person not an inhabitant of a town should become \u201cpoor, and unable to support and provide for him, or herself,\u201d to furnish necessary support and give information to the town to which such person belonged. Public Acts, 1818, May session, Chap. 4. In the Revision of 1821 the provisions of the first section were omitted and the phraseology of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>the second section amended to read that it should be the duty of the selectmen whenever a person not an inhabitant of the town but living therein should become \u201cpoor and unable to support him, or her self, to furnish such pauper\u201d such support as might be necessary, and that the selectmen of the town in which \u201ca pauper belonging to another town is chargeable,\u201d should give notice to the town to which \u201cthe pauper belongs\u201d of his condition, with additional provisions as to the nature of the notice and the time when it is to be given. Statutes, 1821, p. 370. The law continued in this form until the Revision of 1875, when the language was changed substantially to that contained in our present statute. General Statutes, Rev. 1875, p. 199. The development of the statute makes it plain that the word \u201cpauper\u201d in the second sentence has the same meaning as the phrase in the first sentence referring to one who becomes \u201cpoor and unable to support himself.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b207-6\">The trial court has found that Mrs. Reynolds owned an undivided one-twelfth interest in a farm occupied by her mother which, while the plaintiff town was furnishing support, was conveyed by Mrs. Reynolds to her mother without consideration; but it has also found, with sufficient support in the evidence, that this interest had, as a practical matter, no market value and for the purposes of support was valueless to Mrs. Reynolds. The mere ownership of property by a poor person does not free a town from obligation to furnish support unless that property has some substantial value which could reasonably have been appropriated and made to contribute to his support. <em>Wallingford </em>v. <em>Southington, </em>16 Conn. 431, 436; and see <em>Koniak </em>v. <em>Koniak, </em>123 Conn. 338, 342, 195 Atl. 189. The trial court could reasonably conclude that the ownership of this interest in real property did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>prevent the Reynolds family from being eligible to receive support from the town as poor persons under the statute in question. <em>Fish </em>v. <em>Perkins, </em>52 Conn. 200, 203; <em>Harrison </em>v. <em>Gilbert, </em>71 Conn. 724, 727, 43 Atl. 190; <em>Old Saybrook </em>v. <em>Milford, </em>76 Conn. 152, 155, 56 Atl. 496; <em>Madison </em>v. <em>Guilford, </em>85 Conn. 55, 63, 81 Atl. 1046. In <em>Peters </em>v. <em>Litchfield, </em>34 Conn. 264, and the cases cited in it, the property, ownership of which was held to prevent one from being a pauper, was apparently such that it could be made available for his support.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-6\">The trial court has also found that during the period when the family were receiving support, Mrs. Reynolds\u2019 mother owned a house and lot, without incumbrance, having a value of $3500, and Reynolds\u2019 father owned unincumbered real estate having a value of at least $3000. The defendant contends that the Reynolds family were not entitled to support as poor persons because they did not come under the provisions of the statute which requires every town to support such persons belonging to it as \u201chave not estate sufficient for their support, and have no relations of sufficient ability who are obliged by law to support them. . . .\u201d General Statutes, \u00a7 1693. We assume for the purpose of deciding this case that \u00a7 663c is no broader in imposing an obligation of support than is this statute. The obligation of relatives to furnish support is found in \u00a7 1717 of the General Statutes as amended by \u00a7 669c of the Cumulative Supplement of 1935 and \u00a7 563e of the Cumulative Supplement of 1939. As far as material to the issues before us, it provides that when any person shall become poor and unable to support himself or herself and family and shall have certain relatives, including a father and mother, grandfather or grandmother, who are \u201cable to provide such support,\u201d it shall be provided by them, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>and that if they \u201cshall neglect to provide it,\u201d then an action may be brought in which the court may order them to contribute to the support of the poor persons from the time of serving the complaint. Before the court can order relatives to furnish support, it must find that they are \u201c \u2018able to provide\u2019 \u201d it and have neglected to do so. <em>Tulin </em>v. <em>Tulin, </em>124 Conn. 518, 522, 200 Atl. 819. The mere ownership of the property in question by Mrs. Reynolds\u2019 mother and Mr. Reynolds\u2019 father would not necessarily show that they were able to provide support for the Reynolds family; the real estate might be such that no money could be presently produced from it or the owners might be in such a position that its continued possession and ownership were necessary and only sufficient for their own support and that of their immediate families. The trial court has not found, and we are not asked to correct the finding to show, that the persons in question were \u201cable to provide\u201d for the Reynolds family, and in the absence of such a finding we cannot hold from the mere ownership of the property that they were as matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-6\">Nor can we construe the words in \u00a7 1693 of the statutes \u201cobliged by law to support,\u201d as meaning that a town in which there are poor persons belonging to another town must, in furnishing them necessary support, take the risk that there are relatives unknown to them but who may later be found of sufficient means to furnish support. The word \u201cneglect\u201d in \u00a7 1717 of the statutes \u201cimports something more than a mere omission \u2014 something more than a failure without fault. It imports an omission accompanied by some kind of culpability in the conduct of the party.\u201d <em>Lathrop </em>v. <em>Lathrop, </em>78 Conn. 650, 652, 63 Atl. 514. The duty of support referred to in the statute is an imperfect obligation unless it can be made effective by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>action in court, and the words in \u00a7 1693 referring to relations \u201cobliged by law\u201d to support poor persons must mean persons who can be compelled by legal process to support them. There is, in the facts found, nothing to suggest that Mrs. Reynolds\u2019 mother or Mr. Reynolds\u2019 father had \u201cneglected\u201d to provide support as that word is used in \u00a7 1717. The fact that they owned property would not take the Reynolds family out of the purview of the obligation of the plaintiff town to furnish them support.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-6\">The final claim of the defendant is that the notice given to its selectmen did not comply with the requirements of the statute. The only provision the statute contains with reference to the nature of the notice is that it shall state \u201cthe condition\u201d of the poor person. \u201c \u2018The condition\u2019 referred to is that of needing and receiving public support. The statute does not demand that information be given as to the extent or quality of the support which the necessities of the pauper require, but information that his condition is that of one who is in receipt of public aid, as being poor and unable to support himself.\u201d <em>Roxbury </em>v. <em>Bridgewater, </em>85 Conn. 196, 202, 82 Atl. 193. The notice in question was in the form of a letter. It gave the names of all members of the Reynolds family, with the date and place of birth; it stated that they have been \u201caccepted for aid\u201d in the plaintiff town; that \u201cwe understand\u201d Reynolds is unable to contribute to the support of the family, there is no income in the group and Mrs. Reynolds is unable to work; it detailed the various places and dates where the family had lived since leaving the defendant town and stated that the family had not acquired a settlement in any other town; it closed with the request: \u201cMay we have your acceptance of this case?\u201d Slightly paraphrased, our opinion in <em>Bethlehem </em>v. <em>Watertown, </em>51 Conn. 490, 492, aptly states the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>situation: \u201cNothing technical is required in notices of this kind. They should be interpreted as plain practical men understand them. The words [\u2018accepted for aid\u2019] taken in their connection, having regard to the subject matter and the official position of the parties sending and receiving them, fairly import that the persons named were paupers, that they were then residing in the town of [Winchester], that they were chargeable to the town [of Burlington], and that the town was incurring expense in their support; and that is all that the statute requires.\u201d See <em>Windham </em>v. <em>Lebanon, </em>51 Conn. 319, 320; <em>Wile </em>v. <em>Southbury, </em>43 Conn. 53, 54.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-6\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b203-7\"> Sec. 663c. Support of nonresident paupers; notice. When a person not an inhabitant of the town in which he resides shall become poor and unable to support himself, the selectmen of such town shall furnish him with necessary support as soon as his condition shall come to their knowledge, and each selectman neglecting such duty shall be fined seven dollars. The selectmen of each town to which a pauper belonging to another town is chargeable shall give notice of his condition to the town to which such pauper belongs, within fifteen days after they shall know to what town he belongs, and a letter deposited in the postoffico, postage paid, stating the name of the pauper, and that he is chargeable, signed by a selectman of the town where he resides, directed to the selectmen of the town where he belongs, shall be sufficient evidence that notice was given at the time that such letter would, in the usual course of the mail, reach the selectmen to whom it was directed; and actual notice in writing, sent in any other mode, shall be sufficient; . . .</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
