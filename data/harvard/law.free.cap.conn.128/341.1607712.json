He has attempted to appeal directly to this court from that judgment, relying upon \u00a7 5689 of the General Statutes, which allows an appeal \u201cin any cause or action, except summary process, in the superior court, any court of common pleas or any city court.\u201d This section is found in Title 58 of the General Statutes, which is entitled \u201cCivil Actions,\u201d Rev. 1930, p. 1697. In preceding revisions, the predecessors of the present statute have been placed under a like title for more than a hundred years. Appeals by defendants in criminal cases are governed by \u00a7 6492 of the General Statutes, as amended by Cum. Sup. 1939, \u00a7 1464e. This provides for an appeal to this court only from a judgment of the Superior or Common Pleas Courts. It and its predecessors have been included in revisions of the statutes for more than a hundred years under titles <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>dealing with crime and criminal procedure. No appeal lies to this court from a judgment in a criminal case under the provisions of \u00a7 5689, but such appeals must be taken under \u00a7 6492 of the General Statutes as amended and the latter section does not permit an appeal from a city court in such a case.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-6\">The motion to erase is granted.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
