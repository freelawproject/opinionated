The court, in making this ruling, stated that the existence of the appealed conviction would not influence its disposition of the case. This limitation was unnecessary. The judgment was not vacated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>by <em>the </em>appeal. General Statutes, Cum. Sup. 1939, \u00a7 1464e (b); <em>Deposit Bank </em>v. <em>Frankfort, </em>191 U. S. 499, 511, 24 Sup. Ct. 154; <em>Shaffer </em>v. <em>State, </em>124 Neb. 7, 10, 244 N. W. 921; <em>People </em>v. <em>Morlock, </em>234 Mich. 683, 685, 209 N. W. 110. See also, for an extensive discussion of the wide field open to the trial judge in obtaining information, after conviction, relevant to mitigation or aggravation of the seriousness of the offense, <em>People </em>v. <em>Popescue, </em>345 Ill. 142, 177 N. E. 739, 77 A. L. R. 1199. In the case of <em>State </em>v. <em>Adcock, </em>194 S. C. 234, 9 S. E. (2d) 730, cited in note, 134 A. L. R. 1268, and relied on by the defendant, the other charges referred to at the time of sentence had not even been tried but it was held that, as the appellant\u2019s counsel had himself first commented on the facts involved in them and so had opened the door to the statements by the prosecutor, the trial court had the right to take them into consideration in imposing sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-6\">The defendant also claims that the penalty imposed, not less than nine nor more than fifteen years in state\u2019s prison, was excessive. The term imposed being within the limits fixed by General Statutes, \u00a7 6240 (thirty years), this contention \u201cis simply an appeal for clemency made to a court which has no discretionary jurisdiction in the matter.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Levy, </em>103 Conn. 138, 148, 130 Atl. 96. Furthermore, it appears to be fully justified by the facts found. <em>State </em>v. <em>Torkomian, </em>113 Conn. 785, 786, 156 Atl. 860.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-7\">There is no error.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
