By the return it appeared that <em>John HallenbaJee, </em>on the 6th December, 1836, applied to the commissioners of highways of the' town of Greenbush, to lay out a private road, which for a part of the distance would pass over the lands of the applicant, and for the residue of the distance over the lands of the relator. The relator had due notice of the application, and of the proceedings thereon. The commissioners on the same day issued *a warrant or summons, directed and de- [ *368 ] livered to one of the constables of the town, reciting the application and requiring him to summon twelve disinterested freeholders of the town, and not of lcin to the applicant or the relator, to meet, at a specified place, on the 15th day of the same month, to certify on oath to the necessity and propriety of the road applied for. At the specified time and place the constable returned that he had summoned twelve freeholders, giving their names\u2014the freeholders appeared, and were requested by the commissioners to serve as a jury upon the application\u2014they were duly sworn, and after having viewed, &amp;e. they certified in due form that it was necessary and proper to lay out the road. The relator was present, and made no objection to either of the freeholders, nor to the mode of summoning them. The commissioners thereupon proceeded, and laid out the road.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b275-9\"><em>S. Dutcher &amp; I. </em>Harris, for the relator,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AuM\">insisted that the commissioners exceeded their authority in issuing process to a constable to summon the freeholders ; that they should themselves have summoned, or at least designated the freeholders ; and that in consequence of this irregularity the proceedings were void, and the commissioners had no jurisdiction to lay out the road.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b275-10\"><em>S.

The freeholders, when met and sworn, are to view the land, and determine whether the road is necessary. 1 <em>R. S. </em>517, \u00a7 77, 78. Although there does not seem to be any very good reason for requiring the commissioners themselves to summon the freeholders, instead of calling in the aid of some [ *369 ] officer who usually performs such services, *yeb the law is so written, and it must be obeyed. But there was, I think, a substantial compliance with the requirements of the statute. The freeholders were requested by the commissioners to serve as a jury upon the application. This was a sufficient summoning. Uhe statute does not require the commissioners to issue or have any process\u2014it only requires them to summon the freeholders. The fact that the freeholders had assembled under void process, did not disqualify them for acting when they were afterwards legally requested to do so ; and by requesting them to act, the commissioners signified their approval of the freeholders as fully as they could have done in any other way. The relator had notice, was present, and made no objection. I think the road was well laid out.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">Proceedings affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
