Thomas sued Frost for an assault, battery and false imprisonment. The defendant attempted to justify as a <em>special deputy </em>in serving a <em>warrant for larceny, </em>issued by a justice of the peace. The plaintiff required the defendant to show him ^the warrant, before he would submit to the arrest, which the de- [ *\"419 ] fendant not doing, the plaintiff resisted and the defendant beat Mm. The court charged the jury that if the defendant did not show the warrant to the plaintiff, he was a trespasser. The jury found a verdict for the plaintiff, and the defendant on a bill of exceptions, sued out a writ of error.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b313-12\"><em>N.
