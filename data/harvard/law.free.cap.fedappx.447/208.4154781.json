Cir. R. 27(f) and to dismiss Jesse A. Beltran\u2019s appeal for lack of jurisdiction or in the alternative to summarily affirm. Beltran opposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-22\">By way of background, Beltran served on active duty in the Navy from January to March 1980. Since July 2000, he has received veterans\u2019 disability benefits for a degenerative disc condition resulting from a fall that occurred while in service. He also separately receives a disability rating for an extremity radiculopathy condition, which in general terms is the nerve irritation caused by damage to his discs.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-23\">On February 8, 2008, the Board of Veterans\u2019 Appeals confirmed the agency\u2019s rulings that Beltran was not entitled to receive an earlier effective date for (1) a 20% disability rating for his radiculopathy claim before September 23, 2002, (2) a 40% disability rating for the same condition before March 7, 2003, and (3) a 40% disability rating for his disc condition before March 7, 2003. The Board also referred to a Department regional office (RO) for initial determination Beltran\u2019s request for revision based on clear and unmistakable error (CUE) in an August 1985 RO decision, which denied service connection for scoliosis.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-24\">On appeal before the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims, Beltran\u2019s primary challenge was to the Board\u2019s decision to refer his CUE request to the RO. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1190\">*1190</page-number>court, however, rejected this argument on the basis that such request for relief could not be initially adjudicated by the Board, and thus the Board acted properly in referring the matter to the RO to decide the matter in the first instance.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">The court also rejected Beltran\u2019s argument that the agency had failed to meet its duty-to-notify obligations pursuant to 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 5103(a) because he was not informed of the requirements of the applicable diagnostic codes relating to his increased-rating claims. Because Beltran\u2019s brief did not raise any issue regarding the effective dates and disability award ratings assigned to the two conditions on appeal, the court affirmed the Board\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-6\">Our review of Veterans Court decisions is limited by statute. <em>See Yates v. West, </em>213 F.3d 1372,1373-74 (Fed.Cir.2000). By statute, our jurisdiction over appeals from the Veterans Court is limited to those appeals that challenge the validity of a decision of the Veterans Court with respect to a rule of law or the validity of any statute or regulation, any interpretation thereof, or that raise any constitutional controversies. <em>See </em>38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7292. We do not have jurisdiction to hear appeals challenging determinations or the application of law to the facts of a particular case, unless there is a constitutional issue present. <em>See </em>38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7292(d)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b548-7\">Beltran seeks review of the Veterans Court\u2019s decision. In his informal brief, however, Beltran indicates that his appeal primarily seeks to challenge issues relating to his remanded scoliosis claim. These issues were not decided by any RO, thus the Veterans Court held that it was proper for the Board to have remanded the matter for an initial decision. In doing so, the Veterans Court did not interpret any laws or regulations; rather it applied the law to the facts of the case. As the CUE request regarding his scoliosis claim is a factual determination and was not addressed on the merits by the Veterans Court, the issue is not reviewable by this court until a final decision is rendered.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-9\">This court also discerns no constitutional issue within our jurisdiction. Although Beltran\u2019s informal brief says otherwise, his sole support for that contention was the words \u201cdenial of reconsideration.\u201d His \u201ccharacterization of that question as constitutional in nature does not confer upon us jurisdiction that we otherwise lack.\u201d <em>Helfer v. West, </em>174 F.3d 1332, 1335 (Fed.Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b548-10\">The only other issue that Beltran indicates in his brief that the Veterans Court failed to properly decide was to give him a 100% disability rating. Deciding that issue, however, would require this court to reweight the facts, which is outside of this court\u2019s limited authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-11\">Although pro se petitioners \u201care not required to file legally impeccable submissions to proceed on appeal\u201d, <em>Hilario v. Dep\u2019t of Veterans Affairs, </em>937 F.2d 586, 589 (Fed.Cir.1991), Beltran must demonstrate that this court has jurisdiction over his case, and he has not made such a showing. The court therefore grants the Secretary\u2019s motions and dismisses the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-12\">Accordingly,</p>\n<p id=\"b548-13\">It Is Ordered That:</p>\n<p id=\"b548-14\">(1) The Secretary\u2019s motions are granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-15\">(2) Each side shall bear its own costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
