That court affirmed the denial by the Board of Veterans\u2019 Appeals (\u201cBoard\u201d) of his claim of clear and unmistakable error (\u201cCUE\u201d) in a 1993 disability rating decision. We <em>affirm in part, vacate in part, and remand.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b552-8\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b552-9\">On February 18, 1993, while on active duty, Williams had his right kidney removed for cancer treatment. He continued on active duty until July 26, 1993. In September 1993, approximately seven months after the surgery, a Department of Veterans Affairs Regional Office (\u201cRO\u201d) applied Diagnostic Codes (\u201cDC\u201d) 7528 and 7500 in 38 C.F.R. \u00a7 4.115a (1993) to grant Williams a 100 percent disability rating until February 1994 (one year after his surgery), and a 30 percent disability rating thereafter (for his removed kidney), effective March 1, 1994. Williams filed a Notice of Disagreement but did not perfect his appeal. In December 2005, Williams</p>\n<p id=\"b552-10\">filed a claim alleging CUE in this 1993 decision. In its 2009 decision, the Board found no CUE, and the Veterans Court affirmed. <em>Williams v. Shinseki, </em>No. 09-0348, 2010 WL 5421350, at *3 (Vet.App. Dec.28, 2010). Williams then filed this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-11\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b552-12\">Under 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7292(c), our jurisdiction to review Veterans Court decisions is limited to \u201cchallenge^] to the validity of any statute or regulation or any interpretation thereof.\u201d We may not review \u201ca challenge to a factual determination\u201d unless the appeal presents a constitutional issue. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 7292(d)(2). A final RO decision may be attacked collaterally if \u201cthe evidence of record at the time of the original decision\u201d establishes a CUE that is \u201coutcome determinative.\u201d <em>Cook v. Principi, </em>318 F.3d 1334, 1344 (Fed.Cir.2002) (en banc); <em>see </em>38 U.S.C. \u00a7 5109A.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-13\">Williams argues that there is CUE in the 1993 RO decision to reduce his disability rating because the decision violated 38 C.F.R. \u00a7 4.115a DC 7528 (1993). This provision states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b552-14\">The rating under code 7528 will be continued for 1 year following the cessation of surgical, X-ray antineoplastic chemotherapy or other therapeutic procedure. <em>At this point, </em>if there has been no local recurrence or metastases, the rating will be made on residuals, minimum 10 [percent disability rating].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b552-15\"><em>Id. </em>(emphasis added). This regulation was amended, effective February 14, 1994, to require a \u201cmandatory VA examination at the expiration of six months\u201d and to state that \u201cany change in evaluation\u201d should be \u201cbased upon that or any subsequent examination.\u201d 38 C.F.R. \u00a7 4.115b DC 7528 (1994); 59 Fed.Reg. 2523, 2527 (Jan. 18, 1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b552-16\">Williams\u2019s argument is that the RO committed CUE by making a rating on residu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1195\">*1195</page-number>als in September 1993, when the effective regulation stated that the 100 percent \u201crating under code 7528 <em>will be continued for 1 year </em>\u201d and that <em>\u201c[a]t this point </em>... the rating will be made on residuals.\u201d 38 C.F.R. \u00a7 4.115a DC 7528 (1993) (emphasis added). Williams argues that the RO should have waited until March 1994 \u2014 one year after his surgery \u2014 to make a rating on residuals, and that had the RO done so, it would have been required under the amended regulation to base this rating on a medical examination. <em>See </em>38 C.F.R. \u00a7 4.115b DC 7528 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">This issue was properly raised below in both Williams\u2019s opening and reply briefs before the Veterans Court. <em>See </em>Brief of the Appellant at 7-8, <em>Williams v. Shinseki </em>2010 WL 5421350 (arguing that \u201cthe plain language\u201d of the 1993 regulation \u201creferred to an assessment \u2018at this point,\u2019 <em>i.e. </em>at the end of the one-year 100% rating period\u201d and that \u201c[t]he Board ignored this problem of the timing of the RO\u2019s assessment\u201d); Reply Brief of the Appellant at 3, <em>Williams v. Shinseki, </em>2010 WL 5421350 (arguing that the amended regulation for DC 7528 had \u201can explicit examination requirement ... by the end of February 1994 when Mr. Williams\u2019s condition <em>should </em>have been evaluated\u201d). However, this issue was not addressed by the Veterans Court or by the government in its informal brief in this Court. Without the benefit of briefing by the government or a decision by the Veterans Court we are reluctant to address this issue. We therefore vacate and remand for the Veterans Court to address whether the 1993 regulation for DC 7528 required the rating on residuals to be made at the end of one year, rather than, as here, only seven months after Williams\u2019s surgery, and, if so, whether a medical examination was required. Even if the Veterans Court determines that the RO was required to wait until one year after Williams\u2019s surgery to address his rating for residuals, Williams, of course, would still be required to show that this error was outcome determinative, <em>see Cook v. Principi, </em>318 F.3d at 1344, an issue that is beyond our jurisdiction, <em>see </em>38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7292(d)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b553-7\">Williams\u2019s remaining arguments are without merit, and we affirm as to these issues. First, he argues that the regulation in effect in 1993 itself required a medical examination to make a rating on residuals. The plain text of the regulation, however, includes no such requirement. Second, he contends that the VA denied him due process by not complying with its regulations. But arguing that an action was contrary to regulations does not raise a constitutional issue. <em>See Guillory v. Shinseki, </em>603 F.3d 981, 987-88 (Fed.Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b553-8\">AFFIRMED-IN-PART, VACATEBIN-PART, AND REMANDED.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-9\">Costs</p>\n<p id=\"b553-10\">No costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
