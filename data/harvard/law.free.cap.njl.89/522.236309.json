They were gambling houses at Nos. 204 North Chalfonte avenue and 1139 Baltic avenue in the city of Atlantic City. The two indictments were tried together. Separate judgments were entered under the convictions. Writs of error were taken in each case. The cases were brought up under the one hundred and thirty-sixth section of the Criminal Procedure' act. Errors were assigned in the bill of exceptions by the trial judge and causes for reversal were also assigned. The causes relied upon for reversal all relate to the rulings of and statements by the trial court, in relation to Raymond Jefferson, a state\u2019s witness. The record shows this colloquy:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-10\">\u201cMr. Garrison\u2014I object to the reading of that record.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-11\">\u201cThe Court\u2014Bring that record np here. I think this witness ought to be taken into custody on the charge of perjury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-12\">\u201cMr. Garrison\u2014If your honor please, we ask for an exception to that remark and ask to have it spread upon the record.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-13\">\u201cWhereupon the defendant, by his counsel, prays a bill of exceptions, which is hereby allowed and sealed accordingly.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-14\">\u201cThe Court\u2014An officer will take <em>charge o\u00ed </em>this defendant.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>\u201cThe Court\u2014Take this witness into custody and strike his answers from the record, and the jury will pay no attention to what he has testified to. Whatever belongings he has, let him go back and get them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-5\">\u201c(Constable Baker takes the witness into custody.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-6\">\u201cMr. Garrison\u2014To have the record straight, we believe that a juror ought to be withdrawn at this time. We think it is a mistrial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-7\">\u201cThe Court\u2014The juror will not be withdrawn.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-8\">\u201cMr. Garrison\u2014That motion is denied, then ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-9\">\u201cThe Court\u2014Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-10\">\u201cWhereupon the defendant, by his counsel, prays a bill of exceptions, which is hereby allowed and sealed accordingly.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-11\">\u201cThe Prosecutor\u2014All that testimony stricken from the record ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-12\">\u201cThe Court\u2014All of that testimony is stricken from the record and the jury instructed not to pay any attention whatsoever.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-13\">\u00edj\u00ed i-i i|i \u00edfc \u00edj\u00ed #</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-14\">\u201cThe Court\u2014I know you don\u2019t desire any further testimony, but there was some cross-examination from you that I say will remain on the record.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-15\">\u201cMr. Hutter\u2014But that is already on the record.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-16\">\u201cThe Court\u2014Yes, that you will be given the benefit of.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b562-17\">This court held, in the ease of <em>State </em>v. <em>Harrington, </em>87 <em>N. J. L. </em>713, 716; affirmed, <em>Id. </em>716, the arrest of one of the state\u2019s witnesses in view of the jurj, after he had left the stand, is no ground for reversing a judgment. In that case, it was said, his arrest may have been for some offence entirely disconnected with the trial of the ease. But, even if the evidence showed that it was for perjury committed on the witness-staled, that would not vitiate the trial. That case was affirmed in the Court of Errors and Appeals (87 <em>Id. </em>716), for the reasons stated in the Supreme Court. 12 <em>Cyc. </em>542 (L). This case is distinguished from the Harrington case, for in addition to the arrest of the witness in the presence of the jury, a practice not to be commended, the court ordered part, at least, of the testimony of the wit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>ness to be stricken from the record, and directed the jury to pay no attention to what the witness had testified to. This clearly was error injurious to the defendant. While it is true that it is the accepted rule of law in this state that it is the right and duty of a trial judge to comment upon the evidence, in the charge to the jury <em>(State </em>v. Lovell, 88 <em>N. J. L. </em>353; <em>State </em>v. Hummer, 73 <em>N. J. L. </em>714), yet, when he attempts to take from the jury evidence, on the ground that it is unworthy of belief, and emphasizes that ruling by having the witness arrested and taken into custody in the presence of the jury, such action of the trial court Is an improper assumption of, and an infringement upon, the province of the jury. The court stepped outside of its judicial functions.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">For this error the judgments under review will be reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
