The ease was tried by the court without a, jury, resulting in a nonsuit as to the defendant Mary De Leuce, and judgment for possession against the defendant Mike De Leuce.* The ruling of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>court granting a nonsuit in favor of the defendant Mary De Leuce is not contested. The judgment against Mike De Leuce is attacked on the sole ground that the trial court held, that the demand for possession made upon the wife, Mary De Leuce, was a sufficient demand in law to maintain the action against the husband, Mike De Leuce. This is the only question brought under discussion in this appeal. The court held, that the wife was for the purpose of making the demand the agent or servant of the husband. This, we think, was error. At the time the demand was made upon the wife, she said, \u201cNo, no, no. Don\u2019t take the goods. Wait until my husband comes home.\u201d There is a line of authorities, and they are quite uniform. in holding, that, when a demand is necessary in replevin, a demand upon the wife in a suit against the husband is not sufficient to maintain the action.</p>\n<p id=\"AjL\">The rule\u2019 is stated in <em>Cobb. Repl., </em>\u00a7 481, thus: \u201cA demand of one not having authority to deliver or refuse and having no control over the chattels is insufficient. It should usually be made personally upon one in possession and who has power to comply. Demand on wife or servant is not sufficient demand on husband or master. Demand at the house of a bailee in his absence is not good unless knowledge of the demand is brought home to him before the action commenced.\u201d To the same effect are: <em>Wells Repl., </em>\u00a7 375; <em>Mount </em>v. <em>Derick, </em>5 <em>Hill </em>454; <em>Storm </em>v. <em>Livingston, </em>6 <em>Johns. </em>44; <em>Wheeler &amp; Wilson Mfg. Co. </em>v. <em>Teetzlaff, 53 Wis. </em>211; 34 <em>Cyc. </em>1413. This, of course, is based on the theory that the law presumes if one has the possession of goods to which he is not entitled, he will give up the possession, on demand, to the rightful owner, without the trouble and expense of a lawsuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-6\">Eor the error thus pointed out, the judgment of the District Court is reversed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
