MARK M. FAGAN.</parties>\n<otherdate data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b67-7\">Argued February 15, 1916</otherdate>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"Ah6\">Decided June 8, 1916.</decisiondate>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b67-8\">Section 15 of the act for the settlement and relief of the poor <em>(Pamph. Tj. </em>1911, <em>p. </em>890), requiring certain relatives of any indigent person to provide relief for such person, is constitutional.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b67-9\">On <em>certiorari.</em></summary>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b67-10\">Before Justices Garrison, Trenchard and Black.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b67-11\">For the prosecutor, <em>Arthur H. Mitchell.</em></attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b67-12\">For the defendant, <em>Thomas J. Brogan.</em></attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b67-13\">The opinion of the court was delivered by</p>\n<author id=\"b67-14\">Garrison, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AqO\">This writ brings up for review an order of the juvenile court of Hudson county directing the prosecutors, the. grandparents of Pierce Stark,' to pay a weekly sum for liis maintenance as an indigent infant.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-15\">The proceedings are under the act for the settlement and relief of the poor (Revision of 1911, <em>Pamph. L. </em>1911, <em>p. </em>390), and it is not contended that this act does not apply. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>The contentions axe, first, that the provisions of this act were not complied with. We think that they were in all essential respects.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-5\">It is further contended that the provision of section 15 of the act, in so far as it affects grandparents, is. unconstitutional. We think that this is not so.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-6\">The argument that such requirement is not within the police law, or the taxing laws, and that it is an attempt to transmute a purely moral obligation into a legal one are aside from the mark. The statutory requirement rests upon an imperfect legal obligation recognized at common law; such obligations require statutory aid to render them enforceable, but do not derive their obligation from such statutes. The ability of a married woman to recover damages for the alienation of her husband\u2019s affections is a modern illustration in point. <em>Sims </em>v. Sims; 79 <em>N. J. L. </em>577.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-7\">This natural obligation was recognized and enforced by the statute 43 <em>Eliz., c. </em>2, by which father and mother, grandfather and grandmother of poor, impotent persons were required to maintain them as the Quarter Sessions should direct.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-8\">Blackstone gives the basis on which the liability rested at common law (1 <em>Bl. Com. </em>448), and in 30 <em>Cyc. </em>1122 the subject is discussed and the American cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-9\">In New Jersey, at a very early period, the obligation was a recognized one, for, in <em>Kiser </em>v. <em>Overseers of the Poor </em>(1805), 3 <em>N. J. L. </em>5, an order of the Quarter Sessions on a grandfather to support his three grandchildren was set aside solely on the ground that he had had no notice of the proceeding before the Sessions.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-10\">The act is not void for unconstitutionality.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-11\">The order brought up by the writ is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
