Under chapter 156 of the laws of 1915, now no longer a part of the statute <em>(Pamph. L. </em>1916, <em>p. </em>49), a pedestrian crossing a street at a place other than a cross-walk is barred from maintaining an action against an owner of a vehicle not himself driving, for damages caused by a collision, but is not barred as against a driver of the vehicle whether owner thereof or servant of the owner.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b75-11\">2. A case certified should state a concrete case.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b76-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>On case certified from Hudson Circuit.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b76-5\">Before Gummere, Chief Justice, and Justices Swayze and Bergen.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b76-6\">For the plaintiff, <em>Marshall Van Winkle.</em></attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b76-7\"><em>For </em>the defendant, <em>Isidor Kalisch.</em></attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b76-8\">The opinion of the court was delivered by</p>\n<author id=\"b76-9\">Swayze, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Aqk\">The plaintiff\u2019s intestate was killed by reason of contact with the automobile of defendant. She was at the time crossing the street at a place other than a cross-walk. The date is not given but we must infer from the questions certified that it was after July 4th, 1915, when chapter 156 of the laws of that year took effect. It does not appear whether the owner, or a servant was driving the automobile. The first question certified is: \u201cIs negligence to be conclusively presumed against one who crosses a street at any place other than a cross-walk ?\u201d To this we answer no. The statute says nothing about negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-10\">The second question is: \u201cIs one so crossing a street barred, because of so crossing, from maintaining an action for damages?\u201d This question cannot be answered by a simple negative or affirmative. The provision of the statute is: \u201cAny person crossing a street at any place other than the cross-walk shall do so at his own risk. Nothing in this regulation, however, shall relieve the drivers of vehicles from being constantly vigilant, exercising all reasonable care to avoid injuring either persons or property.\u201d <em>Pamph. L. </em>1915, <em>p. </em>297, \u00a7 12. If the first sentence stood alone we would necessarily answer in the affirmative to the second question certified. It is a legislative declaration that the pedestrian assumes the risk. The subsequent language points to a distinction to be made as to the liability of <em>drivers </em>of vehicles. Effect can be given to both provisions by 'holding, (1) that as against <em>owners </em>of vehicles not themselves driving, the pedestrian who crosses a street at a place other than a cross-walk is barred from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>maintaining an action for damages caused by collision; (2) that as against drivers, whether they are owners of the vehicle or servants of the owner, the pedestrian is not barred of his action. It is quite clear that the statute did not mean to exempt drivers of vehicles from exercising all reasonable care or to relieve them- from their legal liability prior to the statute. It may be well to add that the provision now in question no longer forms part of the statute. <em>Pamph. L. </em>1916, <em>p. </em>49.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-5\">The third question is: \u201cWhat is the legal effect of the words \u2018at liis own risk\u2019 as applied to one so crossing a street ?\u201d We cannot answer this otherwise than as already iudicated. We must not be understood to approve a form of question which asks for an abstract lecture on the meaning of words. A case certified should state a concrete case.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-6\">The same objection applies with even greater force to the fourth question: \u201cWhat is the cross-walk of a street?\u201d The question is irrelevant to the concrete case before us since the accident happened at a place other than a cross-walk.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-7\">The fifth question is: \u201cWhat is the cross-walk of a street where asphalted or macadamized surface streets intersect and no actual cross-walk is found and no cross-walk is in any way marked off?\u201d This question is also irrelevant to the facts of the present ease.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
