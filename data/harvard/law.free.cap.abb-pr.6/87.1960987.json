For this reason he ordered Degnen to be discharged from imprisonment.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b100-7\"><em>Henry A. </em>Oram, for the Society for the Reformation of Juvenile Delinquents, the relators.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AzK\">I. The jurisdiction of the House of Refuge extends through the period of minority, and the commitment, therefore, is sufficient, if it appears that the person committed is to be dealt with in the institution according to the charter <em>(Laws of </em>1824, ch. 126 ; <em>Laws </em>of 1860, ch. 241).</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b100-8\">II. The power claimed for the House of Refuge has been recognized by the following decision of the supreme court in the case of Marks Croffskie, rendered Dec. 10, 1867. Leonard, J. : \u201c The term affixed by the magistrate is without authority, and void, when the delinquent is sent to the House of Refuge. The term is void, but it is simply surplusage. When a juvenile delinquent is sent to that institution, he is within the jurisdiction of, and subject to be dealt with by the managers, according to their discretion, until he is bound out an apprentice, dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>charged, or comes of age. I find nothing entitling the \"boy to a discharge as a legal right. His friends must apply to the discretion of the managers.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b101-5\">In the case of People <em>ex rel. </em>Cornell <em>v. </em>House of Refuge,\u2014which was heard, and decided \"by Recorder Hoffman,\u2014the following opinion was delivered:</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b101-6\">\u201cThe House of Refuge is a reformatory institution, not prison. When the legislature authorized courts to send young persons convicted of crimes to this place, it was with a view to their care and custody during minority, and not with a view of confining them a certain period \"by way of punishment. An order of the court, therefore, sending to the House of Refuge a young person \u2018 to \"be dealt with according to law\u2019 is right and proper.\u201d</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b101-7\">Clerke, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A8a\">It is a mistake to say that the term indicated in the conviction is indefinite, so that it gives authority to the House of Refuge to confine the prisoner for an unascertainable period ; the words of the conviction itself indeed do not specify the precise period, but it refers with sufficient certainty to the authority given by law to this institution, and that is in express terms to retain in its custody male persons until their majority, and female persons until the age of eighteen years. By this provision the construction of every conviction is governed. Even if there was any ambiguity in the language, it should be construed liberally, for the authority given to this institution is beneficent in its effect on the individual prisoner and on society ; and in relation to the former the exercise of the authority amounts to a commutation of the ordinary punishment. Strictly speaking, confinement in the House of Refuge does not partake of the degradation or physical suffering to which persons are subject usually in prisons. Its discipline is reformatory, with the view of saving persons, during the susceptibility of tender years, from total profligacy, and restoring them to society in a condition no longer dangerous to it. The order of the judge should be reversed.</p>\n<author id=\"b102-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>Barnard, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AKL\">The Society for the Reformation of Juvenile Delinquents was incorporated by the legislature in 1824; power was given to the managers of the society \u201c to receive and take into the House \u00f3f Refuge to be established by them\u201d certain classes of delinquent children, and \u201cto place the said children committed to their care during the minority of such children at such useful employments, and to cause them to be instructed in such branches of useful knowledge as shall be suitable to their years and capacities.\u201d An annual report was to be made by the manager to the legislature and to the corporation of the city of Hew York of all the facts and particulars which tended to show the effect, whether advantageous or otherwise, of the association. The legislature also directed that the act should \u201cbe construed in all courts and places benignly and favorably for every humane and laudable purpose therein contained.\u201d The institution thus created was a charity, and not a prison. Its object was the reformation of children, and. not their punishment. The children received by them for this purpose were received during their minority for boys, and not beyond eighteen years for girls. In furtherance of this charitable design of reformation, courts by which juvenile offenders were convicted of crime were empowered, instead of sentencing such a person to a State prison or county jail, to order \u201cthat he be removed to and confined in the House of Refuge established for the reformation of juvenile delinquents in the city of Hew York.\u201d The sentence of the law upon the criminal is not imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-4\">Instead thereof he is committed to the care and custody of this charitabte institution during minority, to be instructed in useful knowledge. Ho court - can increase the term of detention or shorten it.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">The act incorporating the society fixes it once for all. The learned judge fell into an error in discharging the defendant. The order should be reversed, and defendant remanded to the care and custody of the relators.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b102-6\">Sutherland, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A7j\">I concur in the conclusion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
