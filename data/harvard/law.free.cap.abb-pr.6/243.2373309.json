The undertaking was for the prosecution of the action, and a return of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>chattels taken in the proceedings, if a return should be adjudged,, and for payment to the defendant in that action of such sum as-might for any cause be recovered by him. The defendant having recovered judgment for costs in that action, assigned, the-undertaking to Morange, who brought this action thereon.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b256-5\">The complaint was as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b256-6\">Title of the Cause.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b256-7\">The complaint of the above-named plaintiff respectfully shows to this court that the above-named defendant, at the city of Brooklyn, on September 20, 1855, made and executed an undertaking, a copy of which is hereto annexed and forms a part of this complaint.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b256-8\">Plaintiff avers that judgment was recovered in the action mentioned in the said annexed undertaking, against the, plaintiff therein, and in favor of the defendant therein, for his costs and disbursements therein, for the sum of one hundred and ninety-seven dollars and ninety-two cents.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b256-9\">Plaintiff avers that on June 17, 1857, a transcript of said judgment was duly filed in the clerk\u2019s office of the county of Kings, and on the same day an execution against the property of Henry C.

F. </em>Wells, in support of the demurrer.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AVd\">I.There is no alle-gation in the complaint that the undertaking was delivered \u00abeither to the sheriff or the plaintiff. The bond must not only be executed, but delivered to the sheriff, or the proceedings will be irregular. (See Wilson <em>v. </em>Williams, 18 <em>Wend., </em>581.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b257-9\">H. There is no allegation that the property referred to in the undertaking, the taking of which by the sheriff forms not only the consideration of the undertaking, but is a condition precedent, was taken by the sheriff.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b257-10\">HI. There are not facts enough stated to-show that this bond took effect as a statute security. (See opinion of Woodruff, J., in Slack <em>v. </em>Heath, 1 <em>Abbotts\u2019 Pr. R., </em>334.) In that case there is an averment of the delivery of the undertaking, that an action was commenced, judgment obtained, &amp;c.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b257-11\">In Shaw <em>v. </em>Tobias (3 <em>Comst., </em>188), it is averred that the bond was given for the prosecution of the suit; that the suit was - commenced, the goods taken in pursuance of the writ, and all \u2022the necessary facts. ,</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b257-12\">In Loomis <em>v. </em>Brown (16 <em>Barb., </em>325), being an action on an undertaking given on granting an injunction, all the material facts are alleged. So also in Ring <em>v. </em>Gibbs (26 <em>Wend., </em>502).</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b257-13\">In 3 <em>Wend., </em>54, Marcy, J., said. \u201c The declaration in the replevin bond should set forth concisely all the proceedings in \u2022 the replevin suit.\u201d (See also <em>Chitt. Pl., </em>212, 216, and 3 <em>Burrill; </em>Phillips <em>v. </em>Price, 3 <em>Maule &amp; S., </em>180 ; 1 <em>Bos. &amp; P., </em>381. See Judge Allen\u2019s opinion in case of Raynor <em>v. </em>Clark, 7 <em>Barb., </em>581.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b257-14\">IV\". The plaintiff is not the owner of the judgment, and has no right to bring suit.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b257-15\">The debt is the principal, the security is the incident. (Green <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number><em>v. </em>Hart, 1 <em>Johns., </em>581; Pattison <em>v. </em>Hull, 9 <em>Cow., </em>747; Jackson <em>v. </em>Blodgett, 5 <em>Ib., </em>202.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b258-5\">Y. The undertaking is a joint one, and the action should have been against Martin and Mudge.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b258-6\">\u201c If several parties stipulate to perform an act, without words, of severalty, the presumption of law is, that they intended to bind themselves jointly.\u201d (2 <em>Parsons on Contr., </em>2 <em>ed., </em>46; 1 <em>Ib.,. </em>11; Hill <em>v. </em>Tucker, 1 <em>Taunt., </em>7; Yorks <em>v. </em>Peck, 14 <em>Barb., </em>644; Ehle <em>v. </em>Purdy, 6 <em>Wend., 629; Code, </em>\u00a7 119.)</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b258-7\"><em>H. H. Morange, </em>in answer.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A6P\">I. The possession of the undertaking by the plaintiff is sufficient answer to the first point of\" the defendant. By section 423 of the Code the sheriff is bpund to deliver the undertaking to the defendant.</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b258-8\">H. Even if there be no property taken by the sheriff, yet the-undertakers are liable, according to the terms of the undertaking, for the payment of such sum as may,/or <em>am/y cause, </em>be-recovered against the defendant.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b258-9\">III. Slack <em>v. </em>Heath (1 Abbotts\u2019 <em>Pr. R., </em>333), cited by defendant\u2019s counsel, is, on the contrary, against all the views and arguments urged by him on the argument, as an examination of that case will show.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b258-10\">IY. It was not necessary to aver specially the assignment of the judgment. The assignment of the undertaking is \u2022 averred, and all the <em>right, title, </em>and <em>interest </em>of Mr. Descombes therein. The interest of Mr. Descombes consists in the judgment referred to in the complaint, and that is assigned. The transfer of the right and title of Descombes to the plaintiff in the undertaking, necessarily carries with it the judgment upon which is based his only right to recover.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b258-11\">The judgment is only the measure of damage, and the plaintiff can only recover the amount thereof against the defendant. A payment of the judgment herein would be a complete and effectual bar against any other action thereon, and the plaintiff\" is foreclosed by the assignment of all his right, title, and interest therein.</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b258-12\">The complaint contains every essential averment. It discloses the nature and cause of the action with sufficient certainty.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b258-13\">Davies, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Afd\"><em>Shaw v. </em>Tobias (3 <em>Comst., </em>188) is an authority.<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>for holding that the complaint in this case contains all needful averments. This doctrine is reaffirmed in Slack <em>v. </em>Heath (1 <em>Abbotts' Pr. </em>R., 334).</p>\n<p id=\"b259-6\">In Yorks <em>v. </em>Peck (14 <em>Barb., </em>647) this court says: \u201cIn all cases of a joint note given upon a joint loan of money, or a joint liability of any kind, it will be presumed it was intended the note should be several as well as joint, and effect will be given to it according to that intention.\u201d So in this case the undertaking will be presumed to be several; and in accordance with section 120 of the Code, the action may be against either of the parties to the instrument. .</p>\n<p id=\"b259-7\">Judgment for the plaintiff on the demurrer, with leave to defendant to answer.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b259-13\"> The terms imposed by the order entered were, service of answer in ten days, and payment of the costs in the cause, including the trial of the issue of law on the demurrer.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
