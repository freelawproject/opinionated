The assessment of damages cannot be made until the court has <em>finally decided </em>that the plaintiff is not entitled to the injunction, (Code, \u00a7 222 ; Weeks <em>v. </em>Southwick, 12 <em>How., </em>171 ; Shearman <em>v. </em>New York Central Mills, 11 <em>Id., 271 </em>; Methodist Church <em>v. </em>Barker, 18 <em>N. Y., </em>465).</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b459-10\">II. There was no such final decision in this case. (1.) The question of injunction was never - passed upon, the action having been discontinued. (2.) The <em>final decision </em>must be a judgment which is <em>entered, </em>and no jxidgment was ever entered here, except the one which it is sought to set aside <em>(Oases supra).</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b459-11\">III. In no case can judgment be entered upon the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>referee\u2019s report. That only fixes the amount of damages, and liquidates them so he can sue on them (Wilde <em>v. </em>Joel, 15 <em>How. Pr., </em>327 ; see Bein <em>v. </em>Heath, 12 <em>How. U. S., </em>177). (2.) The case in 2 <em>Cal., </em>cited on the other side, is overruled here ; and at most only decides that a party signing an undertaking may thereby waive a trial by jury-</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b460-6\">IV. The plaintiff here did not sign the undertaking, and is not bound by its terms. He is, of course, liable for any damages sustained by the defendant by reason of the injunction, but they must be recovered in another way.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b460-7\">V. The judgment roll is fatally defective. This is reason enough for setting the judgment aside (Townsend v. Wesson, 4 <em>Duer, </em>342 ; affirmed in court of appeals, and not reported).</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b460-8\"><em>Geo. W. Wingate, </em>opposed.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A8T\">I. The plaintiff was liable upon the undertaking, whether he signed it or not. It is required to be \u201c on the part of the plaintiff,\u201d \u201c that the <em>plaintiff </em>will pay\u201d the damages <em>{Code, </em>\u00a7 222). It is therefore absurd to say, that his filing an instrument binding him to certain damages as a condition precedent to obtaining certain relief, imposes no liability upon him. In Atkins <em>v. </em>Hearn (3 <em>Abb. Pr., </em>188), the court held that a plaintiff was liable <em>in the same manner and to the same extent, </em>without or with the undertaking required by the Code. An absolute undertaking \u201c <em>that the plaintiff will </em>pay\u201d (whether executed by him or by another person), is an undertaking <em>on his part </em>(Leffingwell <em>v. </em>Chave, 10 <em>Abb. Pr., </em>476).</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b460-9\">II. The regularity of the reference, the report and order of confirmation, are <em>res </em>adjudic\u00f3la, each having been contested at the time, and no appeal taken.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b460-10\">III. The entry of judgment was proper. (1.) The court had adjudged the plaintiff liable, had ascertained the defendant\u2019s damages, and ordered the plaintiff to pay them, which order, not having been appealed from, is conclusive. There was, therefore, no necessity of any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>farther litigation. This was in itself an adjudication of an indebtedness, <em>a judgment. </em>It is directly, within the words of the Code, \u201c a final determination of the rights of the parties in the action\u201d <em>{Code, </em>\u00a7 245). The making up of the <em>judgment roll </em>from the papers on file, was the duty of the clerk, not the attorney, and has nothing to do with the judgment <em>{Code, </em>\u00a7 281; Renouil <em>v. </em>Harris, 1 <em>Code Rep., </em>125 ; Earle <em>v. </em>Barnard, 22 <em>How. Pr., </em>437). (2.) This order was simply a <em>decree </em>at special term, which, <em>when filed, </em>became a judgment, and can be enforced by execution. (3.) The discontinuance by the plaintiff was an acknowledgment that he could not maintain Ms action, and that the injunction was improperly granted, and a reference to ascertain the defendant\u2019s damages will thereupon be ordered (Taaks <em>v. </em>Schmidt, 19 <em>How. Pr., </em>414; Crockets <em>v. </em>Smith, 14 <em>Abb. Pr,, </em>62; see also, Coates <em>v. </em>Smith, 1 <em>Duer, </em>664; Mutual Safety Ins. Co. <em>v. </em>Roberts, 4 <em>Sandf. Ch., </em>592 ; Cumberland Coal <em>&amp; </em>Iron Co. <em>v. </em>Hoffman Steam, &amp;c. Co., . 39 <em>Barb., </em>16). Upon the confirmation of this report, therefore, <em>there was nothing left to litigate. </em>The order was <em>to pay, </em>and it unquestionably can be enforced <em>as an order, </em>if not <em>as a judgment. </em>It is certainly a misuse of terms to say that nothing can be entered upon an adjudication of this character, so as to reach the debtor\u2019s real estate, or give a right to supplementary proceedings.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b461-5\">IY. In California (where the provisions of the Code are the same as that of New York), the entry of judgment upon the referee\u2019 s report was not only <em>sustained, </em>but was <em>expressly ordered. </em>This it is contended is the correct practice.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b461-6\">Y. It will be recollected, that the right to a judgment is not asked against <em>the </em>sureties, against whom a new suit will undoubtedly be necessary, but between a plaintiff and defendant where all points have been conclusively adjudicated. <em>Interest reipublicce est sit finis litium {Broom's Maxims').</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b461-7\">YI. The plaintiff having known of this judgment since December, 1868, and promised to pay it, it is now too late <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>for this motion, particularly as the claim is conceded to \"be due, and the equities are all in favor of the defendant.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b462-5\">Ingraham, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AGG\">On the dissolution of an injunction the defendant obtained an order of reference to assess the damages on the undertaking.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-6\">The undertaking was only signed by the sureties. The referee reported the amount of damages sustained, which report was confirmed, and it was decided that the defendant was entitled to recover the same of the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-7\">The same not being paid on demand, the defendant entered judgment on the report. So far as the sureties are liable, I do not think a judgment against them would be regular, unless an action was commenced and summons served, or at least until notice had been given to them of the hearing before the referee (12 <em>Abb. Pr., </em>189 ; 15 <em>Id., </em>427). Nor do I see the propriety of entering a judgagainst the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-8\">The defendant has two ways of enforcing a recovery on the undertaking,\u2014one by an action, the other by a reference. In the first, he proceeds to judgment; in the other, he applies to the court for an order directing the payment of money, and enforces it in the same manner as other orders of a similar character.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-9\">When the plaintiff has not signed the undertaking, there can be no propriety in entering a judgment against him, and the only proceeding against him would be by an order of the court, directing him to pay the damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-10\">I see no way in which this judgment can be sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-11\">In granting the motion, I do not award costs, and the order must be without prejudice to any other proceedings the defendant may take, either by action on the undertaking, or on the report, or by proceeding by way of attachment.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-12\">\u2022 The motion was granted upon these conditions.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
