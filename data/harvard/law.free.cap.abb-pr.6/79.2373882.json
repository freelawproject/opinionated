Bailey &amp; Brothers, by a lease, dated March 1, 1855, for three years, from May 1, 1855, at $1660 per annum, payable quarterly.

This action was to recover the balance of $188.24, with interest</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b92-7\">The complaint was as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b92-8\">\u201cThat on or about the first day of March, 1855, he (said plaintiff), by an instrument in writing bearing date on that day, did demise unto John T. Bailey, Alfred Bailey, and Andrew Bailey, composing the firm of Bailey <em>&amp; </em>Brothers, the premises known as No. 454 Pearl-street, in the city of New York, for the term of three years, from the first day of May, 1855, at the yearly rent of sixteen hundred and sixty dollars, payable quarterly, on the first days of August, November, February, and May, in each and every year, payment whereof in manner aforesaid, and at the several times aforesaid, the said Baileys covenanted and agreed to and with said plaintiff to make.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b92-9\">\u201c That on the said first day of May, the said Baileys entered into possession of said demised premises, and continued in possession thereof until about the <em>28\u00bfA day of </em>August, 1857, on which day the said Baileys duly assigned said lease and leasehold premises to the defendant, who thereupon accepted the same, and immediately thereafter entered into possession thereof, and continued in possession thereof, under said lease and assignment, up to the fifth day of December, 1857. That on the first day of November, 1857, during the time the said defendant was possessed of said premises, the sum of one hundred and thirty-eight dollars and thirty-three cents was due and payable, pursuant to the terms of said lease, for the balance of rent of the quarter commencing on the first day of August, and termi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>nating on the 31st day of October, 1857: the said defendant having paid the sum of two hundred and seventy-six dollars and sixty-seven cents, on the 29th day of October, 1857, on account of said quarter\u2019s rent.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b93-5\">\u201c That frequent demands have been made upon the said defendant for' the payment of said balance, but he refused to pay the same.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b93-6\">\u201c Wherefore,\u201d &amp;c.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b93-7\"><em>Capron &amp; </em>Lake, for the defendants.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AXnm\">The complaint is insufficient.\u2014I. It does not aver in terms, nor does it show by statements equivalent to such an averment, a breach of the agreement to pay rent. The complaint should either contain an averment that \u201cneither the assignee nor the lessee paid the rent,\u201d or should show that fact by tantamount averments; such as, \u201c that the rent is yet in arrear,\u201d or \u201c is yet unpaid,\u201d or \u201c is yet due to the plaintiff\u201d (Executors of Dubois <em>v. </em>Van Orden, 6 <em>Johns., </em>105 ; Van Rensselaer <em>v. </em>Bradley, 3 <em>Den., </em>135, and see 143, 144), in order to show a cause of action. It merely avers that the rent sued for \u201c became due on the 1st day of November,\u201d and that frequent demands have been made on the defendant, but that <em>he </em>refused to pay the same. For all that appears, the rent may have been paid by the lessee. The demand in this case is immaterial, for the rent is payable on a day certain, and no demand is necessary before suit. The material fact to constitute a breach is, that the rent was still unpaid when the suit was brought. This the complaint does not show.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b93-8\">II. The complaint shows affirmatively that the plaintiff has no right of recovery against the defendant. The landlord\u2019s remedy for the portion of the rent which accrued before the 28th of August, is against the original lessee alone, who is also liable, at the election of the landlord, for the whole. The assignee is not liable to pay rent which accrued before he became assignee, though it became due after he became assignee.

The defendant was in the occupation under his assignment when the quarter\u2019s rent fell due and the breach of the covenant occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-7\">Judgment for the plaintiff, on the demurrer, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
