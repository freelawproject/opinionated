Upon an affidavit showing that a cause of action existed, and its grounds, and stating that the defendant was not a resident of the State of Hew York, the plaintiff obtained an order of attachment against his property, which the defendant now moved to have discharged. An amendment of the complaint was sought by him on the same motion ; but the questions involved in that regard are not material to this point. His affidavit, so-far as it related to the question of residence, was as follows :\u2014</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b386-12\">\u201c That deponent is perfectly solvent, and is, and has been for the last twelve years, a merchant, doing a regular and continuous business in this city, and for the last three years, April next, at Ho. 28 B. street, and is the senior member of the firm of K.

Larned, </em>for the defendant, appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AQP\">I. In the matter of Alexander Thompson (1 <em>Wend., </em>43), an attachment was issued under section 23 of the then act relative to absconding and absent debtors (1 <em>Rev. </em>Laws, 157); and the question then was, whether Thompson was a <em>resident </em>of this State within the meaning of the act.. It was there held that <em>domicil </em>merely did not constitute residence within the meaning of the act. That the whereabouts of the person, not his family or dwelling, the intention of remaining, and the ability to serve process upon him, were the considerations upon which the decision of the question of the <em>residence </em>of the party under the statute must rest.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b388-9\">In Frost <em>a. </em>Brisbin (19 <em>Wend., </em>11), the defendant\u2019s wife and child remained in this State at his former residence, while he went to Milwaukee, as he swore, without .any intention of making that place his permanent residence, unless he succeeded in business. He was held to be a non-resident within the meaning of the act to abolish imprisonm\u00e9nt for debt <em>(Laws of </em>1831); and th.e court say: \u201c The domicil of a citizen may be in one State and his actual residence in anotherand again hold that the legal import of the word <em>residence </em>is to he settled by reference to the object of the statute in settling the rights and remedies of debtor and creditor.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b389-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>In Haggart <em>a. </em>Morgan (1 <em>Seld., </em>422), in the Court of Appeals, the court referred to the two preceding cases, and approved them. It also held virtually that a defendant who was a housekeeper in the city of Hew York, and had been for many years, being absent for a length of time, though with the intention of returning as soon as a particular piece of business was completed, was yet a non-resident within the spirit of the act. The converse of the proposition established by these cases must be true, to wit: a person, though having his domicil in another State, but his business and his business residence here, who can be served with process as readily as one who never goes beyond its limits, is a resident within the meaning, spirit, and intent of the act.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b389-5\">II. The Supreme Court, at general term, in this district, has decided, in Towner <em>a. </em>Church (2 <em>Abbotts\u2019 Pr. R., </em>299), this precise question.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b389-6\">III. If there can be a case in which a person, having his domicil in another State, is yet entitled to be considered within the meaning and spirit of section 227 of the Code as a resident, and entitled to exemption from attachment, this is such a case.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b389-7\"><em>George Bliss, jr., </em>for the plaintiff, respondent.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A0f\">I. The Legislature has used a word, \u201c resident,\u201d whose meaning is clear and well-defined ; and it must be presumed have used it in its ordinary and accepted signification. 1. Whatever shades of difference there may be in the meaning of the word \u201c resident,\u201d as found in the standard dictionaries and decided cases, no definition of that word can be found in any of them which would make the defendant a resident, <em>a. </em>The ordinary dictionaries are uniform in their definition of the word. <em>(Webst. Dict., </em>\u201c resident,\u201d \u201c reside <em>Johns. Dict., </em>\u201c resident.\u201d) <em>b. </em>The law dictionaries are equally precise and uniform. <em>(Spelm., </em>\u201c residence <em>Burr. Law Dict., </em>\u201c resident,\u201d \u201c residence <em>Bouv. Law. Dict., </em>\u201c resident.\u201d) <em>c. </em>The decided cases are, so far as the present question is concerned, equally uniform. They vary among themselves in certain respects, but not in holding that the defendant is \u201c not a resident.\u201d (In re Fitzgerald, 2 <em>Cai., </em>137 ; Roosevelt <em>v. </em>Kellogg, 20 <em>Johns., </em>208 ; Porter <em>v. </em>Miller, 3 <em>Wend., </em>229 ; In re Wrigley, 4 <em>Wend., </em>602; S. C. on appeal, 8 <em>Wend., </em>134; Frost <em>v. </em>Brisbin, 19 <em>Wend., </em>11; Crawford <em>v. </em>Wilson, 4 <em>Barb., </em>405; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>Burrows v. Miller, 4 <em>How., </em>349; Lee <em>v. </em>Stanley, 9 <em>How., </em>272; Bartlett v. New York, 5 <em>Sandf., </em>44; Isham v. Gibson, 1 <em>Bradf. Surr. R., </em>69, 80.) So also in other States. (Sears v. Boston, 1 <em>Metc., </em>250; Stratton v. Brigham, 2 <em>Sneed </em>(Tenn.), 420; United States v. Penelope, 2 <em>Pet. Adm., </em>450; Spragins v. Houghlin, 2 <em>Scam. </em>(Ill.), 377, 396.) 2. These boobs and cases, with the definitions they contain, were most of them before the Legislature when the Code was passed ; and the Legislature is, therefore, conclusively presumed to have used the word \u201c resident\u201d in the sense there defined. There is then no room whatever for construction, there being no ambiguity in the meaning of the word. (Waller v. Harris, 20 <em>Wend., </em>555, 561, per Bronson, J.; Newell v. The People, 3 <em>Seld., </em>97; McCluskey v. Cromwell, 1 <em>Kern., </em>601; Ford v. Babcock, 2 <em>Sandf., </em>527; <em>Sedgw. on Statutory Constr., </em>295; United States v. Penelope, 2 <em>Pet. Adm., </em>450; Fisher v. Blight, 2 <em>Cranch, </em>358, 399.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b390-6\">H. The Legislature wisely used the word \u201c resident,\u201d both because its meaning was thus carefully defined, and because there were good reasons of policy for the distinction it draws.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b390-7\">' III. The decided cases in this State, upon this and similar statutes, fall naturally into two classes. 1. Those cases in which the person comes here from abroad and remains for a time, but either has a fixed intention <em>not </em>to settle here, or has no definite intention of doing so, meaning to be governed by circumstances. In these cases, he is, at the time the question arises, actually within the State. (In re Fitzgerald, <em>2 Cai., </em>137 ; In re Wrigley, 4 <em>Wend., </em>602 ; S. C. on appeal, 8 <em>Wend., </em>134 ; Frost v. Brisbin, 19 <em>Wend., </em>11; Burrows v. Miller, 4 <em>How., </em>349.) In these cases he is held a non-resident. 2. Those cases where a person, originally domiciled and resident here, has left the State for a temporary purpose\u2014though one that may detain him for years \u2014yet under such circumstances as show that he retains his technical domicil here, and intends to return here. In these cases, he is, at the time the question arises, actually out of the State. (In re Thompson, 1 <em>Wend., </em>43; Haggart v. Morgan, 4 <em>Sandf., </em>198; S. C. on appeal, 1 <em>Seld., </em>422.) How long the absence may be, and under what circumstances, we need not here inquire; But see Hurlburt v. Seely (10 <em>How. Pr. R., </em>507). In these cases also the person is held a non-resident.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b390-8\">IY. Whether we consider the case of the present defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>as falling within the first or the second of these classes, or as occupying a middle ground, he is equally a non-resident. (Burrows <em>v. </em>Miller, 4 <em>How. Pr. R., </em>349; Lee <em>v. </em>Stanley, 9 <em>How. Pr. R., </em>272.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b391-5\">V. The case of Towner <em>a. </em>Church (2 <em>Abbotts' Pr. R., </em>299) is not a binding authority in this court (Ford <em>v. </em>Babcock, 2 <em>Sandf., </em>524); and even if we grant the binding force of that decision, it does not go far enough to cover the case of the present defendant, and in point of fact is interpreted in the Supreme Court as not covering this case. Corlies <em>a. </em>McMurray, Ms. (First District, Special Term), decided in April or May, 1857, by Judge Mitchell. It presented a state of facts entirely on all-fours with the present case, except that the defendant there, just prior to stopping payment, had removed from Mew Jersey to Mew York, leaving, however, his furniture in Mew Jersey. Judge Mitchell held him a non-resident.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b391-6\">VI. There are various other existing statutes, in which the same language, substantially, is used as in the Code, and in none of them is any such construction of the word \u201c resident\u201d ever contended for. Such are\u20141. The Judiciary Act. 2. The statute requiring a non-resident plaintiff to give security for costs. 3. The laws as to taxation, particularly that of 1855 <em>(chap. </em>37), imposing a tax upon persons like the defendant, under the designation of \u201c not residents of the State.\u201d 4. The provisions of the Code requiring a debtor in supplementary proceedings to be examined only in the county where he resides, which is held to preclude the examination of a resident of Mew Jersey. 5. Statutes requiring residence to give jurisdiction. (See Clason <em>v. </em>Cooley, 5 <em>Sandf., </em>460.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b391-7\">Woodruff, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AzA\">announced the opinion of the court, that the defendant Bockover was not a resident of the State of Mew York within the meaning of the provisions of the Code respecting attachments; and that the order appealed from must be affirmed.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b391-8\"><em> </em>No written opinion was rendered.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
