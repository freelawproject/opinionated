He died February 4, 1865, leaving an alleged last will and testament, devising his real estate, and appointing executors. The probate of this will was contested by his heirs, and pending the litigation, on February 26, 1867, the plaintiff was appointed receiver of the rents, profits and income of the estate, and was authorized to commence this action. The defendant continued to occupy the premises till May 1, 1867. No letters testamentary or of administration were granted on said estate. Plaintiff claimed more than $550 per annum for the use and occupation, and the principal question litigated was whether the defendant was chargeable with the real value of the use and occupation of the premises, or with the amount of annual rent as established by the lease expiring May 1, 1865.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b230-6\"><em>George C.
