[Doc. # 8]. Petitioning Creditor Radia Enterprises, Inc. (\"Petitioning Creditor\") filed a Response to Alleged Debtor's Motion [Doc. # 13], Alleged Debtor filed a Reply to Opposition to Motion to Dismiss [Doc. # 19], and Petitioning Creditor filed its own Reply to Creditor's Surreply on Motion for Dismissal. [Doc. # 21]. In its Motion, Alleged Debtor argues that, because there is no legal basis\n   for Petitioning Creditor's filing of the involuntary petition, the involuntary petition should be dismissed with prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   This is a core proceeding under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20157\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 157\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(2)(A) and (O) and venue is proper under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201409\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1409\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). The court has jurisdiction over core proceedings under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201334\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1334\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and 157(a) and Local General Order 2012-7 of the United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Because the court finds that Petitioning Creditor cannot sustain its burden in terms of establishing that Alleged Debtor owes it an undisputed debt sufficient for the filing of an involuntary bankruptcy petition, the court will grant Alleged Debtor's Motion and dismiss this case with prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On May 17, 2018, Petitioning Creditor filed a Chapter 7 involuntary petition against Alleged Debtor, averring that Alleged Debtor was not paying its non-contingent, undisputed debts as they came due. [Doc. # 1]. The involuntary petition lists only one creditor, Radia Enterprises, Inc. (Petitioning Creditor), and a single claim in the amount of $85,372.77, described as \"unpaid invoices for goods sold on credit.\" [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , p. 3]. Alleged Debtor filed both a Reply to the Involuntary Bankruptcy [Doc. # 7] and a Motion to Dismiss Case [Doc. # 8] on June 5, 2018, arguing that the involuntary petition is baseless and involves debts owed by third-party entities, not Alleged Debtor or its affiliates. The court set both the Reply and Motion for hearing to be held on June 26, 2018. [Doc. # 10].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   With its Motion to Dismiss, Alleged Debtor filed the affidavit of Anthony S. Collins (\"Mr. Collins\"), the owner/operator of Alleged Debtor, in which Mr. Collins averred that while Alleged Debtor has previously done business with an entity affiliated with Petitioning Creditor, Alleged Debtor does not owe Petitioning Creditor any outstanding amounts. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , pp. 3-4]. Mr. Collins' affidavit further states that Petitioning Creditor's involuntary suit appears to be an attempt at involving third parties in its dispute with Theodore R. Ralston (\"Mr. Ralston\"), a man Mr. Collins identified as unaffiliated with Alleged Debtor and Mr. Collins' related businesses. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In its Response to Motion for Dismissal [Doc. # 13], filed on June 21, 2018, Petitioning Creditor argues that there is no genuine dispute regarding the factual basis for its claim of a debt owed it by Alleged Debtor. In support, Petitioning Creditor submitted the affidavit of Rupendra Radia (\"Mr. Radia\"), the president of Petitioning Creditor, in which Mr. Radia states that Petitioning Creditor's business relationship with Alleged Debtor started when Petitioning Creditor hired Mr. Ralston as its business development director. [Doc. # 14, p. 2]. Mr. Radia's affidavit explains that Mr. Ralston connected Petitioning Creditor with Alleged Debtor and then placed orders with Petitioning Creditor on Alleged Debtor's behalf. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ]. Mr. Radia's affidavit goes on to explain that the debt underlying Petitioning Creditor's involuntary filing stems from delivery of twelve orders of consumer goods that Petitioning Creditor avers Alleged Debtor is liable for. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , pp. 3-8].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Petitioning Creditor also submitted copies of invoices, email chains, and shipping documents that purport to outline the transactional dispute underlying Petitioning Creditor's claim. [Doc. # 14-1 through 14-12]. Many of the submitted documents refer to Ted (Mr. Ralston), World Source Simple, LLC, and a delivery location at 2200 Allentown Road, Lima, Ohio.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Additionally, Petitioning Creditor submitted a sworn affidavit of Cathy Meilchen (\"Ms. Meilchen\"), Petitioning Creditor's accountant, alongside exhibits that appear to outline Ms. Meilchen's attempts at collecting monies from Alleged Debtor for the goods at issue. [Doc. # 15].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   At the June 26th hearing, Alleged Debtor's counsel and Petitioning Creditor's counsel appeared by phone. Upon being questioned by the court, Alleged Debtor's counsel admitted that it has fewer than twelve creditors. The parties also argued in support of their respective positions and the court allowed the parties to submit additional briefing and evidence regarding Alleged Debtor's Motion to Dismiss. The court also set a trial for determining whether Alleged Debtor pays its debts as they come due that was to be held on September 13, 2018.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   [Doc. # 18].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On June 29, 2018, Alleged Debtor filed its Reply to Opposition to Motion to Dismiss [Doc. # 19], arguing that the evidence before the court demonstrates that Petitioning Creditor's claim remains subject to genuine issues of fact, requiring dismissal of the involuntary petition. In support, Alleged Debtor submitted exhibits that outline a Texas state court lawsuit in which Petitioning Creditor appears to be suing third party entities for the same $85,372.77 underlying its involuntary petition brought against Alleged Debtor. [Doc. # 19, pp. 14-45]. Alleged Debtor also submitted a second, more extensive affidavit from Mr. Collins and an affidavit from Mr. Ralston, both of which reference the Texas state court action and maintain that Mr. Ralston is not affiliated with Alleged Debtor. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , pp. 7, 10]. Both affidavits also identify 2200 Allentown Road, Lima, Ohio as the address of a multi-tenant warehouse owned by another of Mr. Collins' companies, 2200 Allentown Road LLC, a warehouse that is currently occupied by a number of tenants, including Mr. Ralston and his business, World Source Simple, LLC. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , pp. 6, 10].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In its Reply to Creditor's Surreply on Motion for Dismissal [Doc. # 21], filed on July 24, 2018, Petitioning Creditor argues that it has presented sufficient evidence demonstrating that its claim against Alleged Debtor is not subject to a bona fide dispute. Petitioning Creditor explains that Ohio agency and acceptance/delivery law necessarily holds Alleged Debtor liable for the goods allegedly ordered on its behalf by Mr. Ralston. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , pp. 4-7]. Petitioning Creditor further argues that Alleged Debtor's course of conduct and prior dealings with Petitioning Creditor establish a connection, under the Ohio law of apparent/ostensible authority, supporting Alleged Debtor's liability for the $85,372.77 owing from orders placed by Mr. Ralston. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , pp. 6-7].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     LAW AND ANALYSIS\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Section 303 of the Bankruptcy Code allows for the filing of an involuntary petition by holders of debt claims that are \"not contingent as to liability or the subject of a bona fide dispute as to liability or amount.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20303\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 303\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b) ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    In re Soderberg and Schafer CPAS, LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3785470\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/441/262/#p263\">\n    441 B.R. 262\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 263 (Bankr.

Thus, the court finds that Petitioning Creditor's claim is subject to a bona fide dispute.

In a published opinion, the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals endorsed the\n   <em>\n    Eastown\n   </em>\n   bona fide dispute test and affirmed the bankruptcy court, holding that the bankruptcy court's decision to dismiss the involuntary petition against DSC, Ltd. was not clearly erroneous.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5418418,3114492\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/486/940/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   In this case, the parties dispute the factual basis underlying Petitioning Creditor's assertion of a debt owed it by Alleged Debtor. In conflicting affidavits, both parties and their representatives present dramatically different accounts of what, in some ways, amounts to a fairly typical delivery and acceptance sales dispute. On one hand, Petitioning Creditor asserts that Alleged Debtor ordered and accepted shipments of consumer goods worth $85,372.77 that Alleged Debtor allegedly refused and refuses to pay for. [Doc. # 13, p. 4]. Petitioning Creditor also asserts that Mr. Ralston is an agent of Alleged Debtor,\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   that Mr. Ralston was an actor involved in the disputed transactions [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ; Doc. # 21, pp. 6-8], and that the goods in question were delivered to Alleged Debtor's warehouse located at 2200 Allentown Road, Lima, Ohio. [Doc. # 14, p. 2].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   On the other hand, Alleged Debtor maintains that not only has it not received the goods in question, Mr. Ralston is not its agent and Alleged Debtor never placed the orders that serve as the basis for Petitioning Creditor's debt claim. [Doc. # 8, p. 4]. Alleged Debtor's owner, Mr. Collins, further explains that another one of his companies, 2200 Allentown Road LLC, owns the multi-tenant warehouse that houses goods belonging to numerous entities [Doc. # 19, p. 6], including Mr. Ralston's affiliated business, World Source Simple, LLC. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , p. 10]. Alleged Debtor also submitted evidence of a Texas state court lawsuit in which Petitioning Creditor appears to be suing third parties, including Mr. Ralston and World Source Simple,\n   LLC, for the same debt it claims is owed it by Alleged Debtor. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , pp. 11, 14-45].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   For purposes of this decision, the court will assume that Petitioning Creditor initially offered sufficient evidence in support of its petition to \"establish a prima facie case that no bona fide dispute exists.\"\n   <em>\n    Soderberg\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3785470\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/441/262/#p263\">\n    441 B.R. at 264\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Sims\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6524384,10510807\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/994/210/\">\n    994 F.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   221 ). However, Alleged Debtor has also submitted a considerable amount of evidence that either directly contradicts or substantially complicates Petitioning Creditor's arguments. Therefore, while the court assumes that Petitioning Creditor has met its initial burden, the court finds that Alleged Debtor has met its burden in terms of \"present[ing] evidence demonstrating that a bona fide dispute does exist.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6524384,10510807\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/994/210/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (quotation omitted). Thus, the burden has shifted back, and Petitioning Creditor has not overcome the hurdle presented by Alleged Debtor's conflicting evidence. Accordingly, Petitioning Creditor has failed to satisfy the eligibility requirements of \u00a7 303(b) as set forth in\n   <em>\n    DSC, Ltd.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   At a minimum, the court finds that the record before it presents a number of genuine issues of fact\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   integral to the question of Alleged Debtor's liability, such as: were the goods in question actually ordered by Alleged Debtor, did Mr. Ralston order or accept the goods instead of Alleged Debtor, is the relationship between Alleged Debtor and Mr. Ralston sufficient to support a finding of \"agency,\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   \" and did some type of misdelivery occur at the multi-tenant warehouse where the goods were shipped? Even if the court were to fully credit the affidavit of Petitioning Creditor's president, and his version of the events that allegedly gave rise to Alleged Debtor's debt liability, Alleged Debtor has submitted enough conflicting evidence to render the debt at hand subject to a bona fide factual dispute, and thus insufficient to serve as a basis for the filing of an involuntary bankruptcy petition.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    DSC, Ltd.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5418418,3114492\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/486/940/\">\n    486 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   945 ;\n   <em>\n    Sims\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6524384,10510807\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/994/210/\">\n    994 F.2d at 221\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   As for the presence of unresolved legal issues, Petitioning Creditor's briefing either omits or ignores the extent to which Alleged Debtor's liability is still subject to an ongoing, live controversy.
