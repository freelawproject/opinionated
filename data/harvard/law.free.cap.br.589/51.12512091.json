[Rec. Doc. 1]. The Trustee, Todd S. Johns (\"Trustee\" or \"Appellee\"), opposes the appeal and recommends that the Court affirm the Bankruptcy Court's order. [Rec. Doc. 9]. For the reasons assigned herein, the order of the Bankruptcy Court is hereby\n   <strong>\n    REVERSED\n   </strong>\n   and\n   <strong>\n    REMANDED\n   </strong>\n   for further proceedings consistent with this Memorandum Ruling.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND INFORMATION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   On March 17, 2016, the Miners filed a voluntary joint petition for Chapter 13 bankruptcy relief. [Bankr. Doc. 1].\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Donald Miner, age 62, is employed full time at Rose Neath Funeral Home where he earns a gross monthly income of $5,788.61. He is also employed part time at Aulds Funeral Home where he earns an additional $525.00 per month. Sandra Miner, age 52, is disabled and receives Social Security. The Miners are above median income, and therefore have an applicable commitment period of 60 months to complete Chapter 13 bankruptcy.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201325\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1325\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(4).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Miners filed their first proposed Chapter 13 Plan on March 24, 2016. [Bankr. Doc. 8]. However, the Trustee and several creditors objected to the Plan. [Bankr. Docs. 21, 24, 26, 29]. On September 14, 2016, the Miners filed an Amended Plan. [Bankr. Doc. 46]. The same day the Miners also filed Amended Schedules I and J, which reflected Mr. Miner's voluntary monthly contributions to his 401(k) retirement plan in the amount of $700.82 (12% of his salary), and repayment to a 401(k) loan in the amount of $356.18 per month. [Bankr. Doc. 49]. Amended Schedule J indicated that Mr. Miner's 401(k) loan would be paid off February 20, 2020.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201325\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Amended Schedule I reflected that Mrs. Miner's only source of income is $1,253.00 from Social Security.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201325\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On October 5, 2016, the Trustee filed objections to the confirmation of the Debtors' proposed Plan because it failed to increase payments to unsecured creditors after Mr. Miner's 401(k) loan repayments are complete. [Bankr. Doc. 52]. The Trustee questioned whether the Plan was proposed in good faith given Mr. Miner's monthly $700.82 voluntary contribution to his retirement fund, which is 12% of his gross monthly income. [Bankr. Doc. 52, 57]. However, after considering the inclusion of Mrs. Miner's Social Security income in addition to Mr. Miner's income on the overall budget, the Trustee withdrew his objections, recommended confirmation of the Plan, and submitted a proposed order of confirmation for the Court's approval. [Bankr. Doc. entry dated Nov. 9, 2016].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On January 16, 2017, the Bankruptcy Court denied confirmation of the proposed Plan as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   Denied without prejudice, hearing required. Hearing set 9:30 a.m. on 3/8/2017. Combined, the debtor's voluntary 401(k) contribution and 401(k) loan repayment calculate to about 18% of his income.

[Bankr. Doc. 64]. The Bankruptcy Court's order contained the following holdings: (1) the Miners failed to meet their burden of proof for confirmation; (2) Mr. Miner's post-petition voluntary payments to his 401(k) plan are properly considered disposable income; (3) post-petition voluntary 401(k) contributions are allowed in Chapter 13 cases; (4) post-petition 401(k) contributions are limited by the good faith requirements of the Code; and (5) Mr. Miner cannot offset\n   increased 401(k) contributions with his wife's Social Security income.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201325\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201325\">\n    at 7\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The Bankruptcy Court also provided general guidance regarding retirement account contributions to the Chapter 13 bar, stating that in the future the Bankruptcy Court will presume that a 3% voluntary contribution to a retirement plan is reasonable.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201325\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201325\">\n    at 20\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

[Bankr. Docs. 66 and 70]. The 401(k) loan repayment was not changed and remained at $356.18.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201325\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The Miners also filed Amended Schedules I and J.

The Court finds this language to be unambiguous. This language on its own would exclude funds already contained within a retirement account at the time the petition is filed and the bankruptcy estate is created. Directly following this language, and contained within the same subparagraph, is the phrase added by BAPCPA \"except that such amount under this subparagraph shall not constitute disposable income as defined in section 1325(b)(2).\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20541\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 541\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(7). The Court finds that this language is also unambiguous. Although the placement by Congress of the \"hanging paragraph\" at issue is perhaps awkward, the plain language demonstrates that Congress intended to exclude retirement contributions from available disposable income as defined by the code in section 1325(b). As noted above, the added phrase is not needed to exclude pre-petition retirement contributions under the plain language of the statute. This Court can only conclude that Congress intentionally added the phrase to exclude all retirement contributions from a debtor's disposable income.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Renteria\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3955804\" index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/470/838/#p843\">\n    470 B.R. 838\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 843 (9th Cir.BAP 2012) (when Congress amends a statute to add language courts must presume the statute is intended to serve some purpose).\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   In reaching this decision this Court joins the other courts within the Fifth Circuit\n   that have considered this issue and reached the same conclusion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Garza\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12269408\" index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/575/736/\">\n    575 B.R. 736\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    In re Devilliers\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3901999\" index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/358/849/\">\n    358 B.R. 849\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    In re Oltjen\n   </em>\n   , No. 07-60534,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2007%20WL%202329695\">\n    2007 WL 2329695\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Bankr.

[Rec. Doc. 8 at 21]. The Trustee urges this Court to affirm the finding that the proposed plan lacked good faith. [Rec. Doc. 9 at 16-17]. Whether a correct legal standard has been applied by the Bankruptcy Court is a legal conclusion, which is reviewed de novo. The Bankruptcy Court's determination of good faith is reviewed for clear error, giving due regard for the Bankruptcy Court's opportunity to observe the credibility of the witness.\n   <em>\n    In re Crager\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4151354,3509663\" index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/691/671/\">\n    691 F.3d 671\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 675 (5th Cir. 2012).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   This Court agrees with the Bankruptcy Court's finding that a debtor's post-petition contributions to a 401(k) plan are one of many elements it must consider in determining good faith. A bankruptcy court is required to consider whether a plan has been proposed in good faith during the confirmation process.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201325\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1325\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(3). This inquiry requires the Bankruptcy Court to evaluate a proposed plan in its entirety, which would include a debtor's retirement contributions as set forth within the plan. However, the amount contributed by a debtor within the legal limits established by the Internal Revenue Service cannot be the sole basis for determining that a plan has been filed in bad faith.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Garza\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12269408\" index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/575/736/\">\n    575 B.R. at 751\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . It appears that the Bankruptcy Court in this case denied confirmation primarily because Mr. Miner's 401(k) contributions reduced the amount of funds available to dispense to creditors. If additional circumstances indicate that a debtor is attempting to abuse the spirit of the Bankruptcy Code through his retirement contributions, the Trustee and unsecured creditors may object for lack of good faith.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Unfortunately, the Bankruptcy Court applied an incorrect test in determining that the Plan proposed by the Miners was not proposed in good faith.
