As it turns out, Ms. Hang is ineligible for a discharge under the temporal discharge bar of \u00a7 727(a)(8) because she received a discharge in a prior bankruptcy case filed within eight years of the filing of her present case. She moves to dismiss the complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1), made applicable to this proceeding by Federal Rule of Bankruptcy Procedure 7012(b). The motion raises the issues of Mr. Bernier's Article III standing, the ripeness of his claims for judicial review, and whether Ms. Hang's ineligibility for a discharge under \u00a7 727(a)(8) moots Mr. Bernier's \u00a7 727(a)(3) and (4) claims. Mr. Bernier objects to the motion, citing the immediate adverse impact an order dismissing the complaint would have on his rights as a creditor and his ability to assert those rights under \u00a7\u00a7 727(a)(3) and (4) and 523(a)(10).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The use of the temporal discharge bar of \u00a7 727(a)(8) as a shield against denial of discharge under \u00a7 727(a)(2) through (7), which relate to a debtor's misconduct in or in connection with a case, presents an issue of first impression. At first blush, Ms. Hang's position appears deceptively straightforward and appealing. Why waste judicial time and resources adjudicating such claims if the debtor is ineligible for a discharge under \u00a7 727(a)(8) ? Upon a more in-depth review, however, the flaws in her arguments become apparent; they ignore the important distinctions between \u00a7 727(a)'s subsections, their underlying legislative goals, and the significance of the interplay between \u00a7\u00a7 523(a)(10) and 727(a)(2) through (7). Accordingly, the motion to dismiss must be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Jurisdiction\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The Court has jurisdiction over this matter under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201334\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1334\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and 157(b), and Rule 109 of the Local Rules of the United States District Court for the District of Rhode Island. This is a core proceeding under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20157\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 157\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(2)(J).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Although required to do so, Ms. Hang did not disclose on her bankruptcy petition that she previously filed a chapter 7 bankruptcy case in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Middle District of Florida on June 6, 2010, and received a discharge on October 7, 2010.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Bk. No. 10-13349-KRM. Some seven years later, on September 8, 2017, she filed the present chapter 7 case in this Court. Ms. Hang readily agrees that \u00a7 727(a)(8)'s eight-year bar renders her ineligible for a discharge in this present case. In fact, her discharge ineligibility is the foundation of her dismissal arguments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In support of his \u00a7 727(a)(3) claim, Mr. Bernier alleges that Ms. Hang unjustifiably failed to maintain business records for\n   the cleaning business she operated for at least five years before filing this case, a business which was her primary source of income during that period.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff's Complaint to Deny Discharge (\"Complaint,\" Doc. # 1). To support his \u00a7 727(a)(4) claim, Mr. Bernier alleges that Ms. Hang knowingly engaged in fraudulent behavior in connection with this case by omitting, misrepresenting, or failing to accurately disclose on her bankruptcy petition, schedules, and statement of financial affairs material information about her pre-bankruptcy financial condition, the value of her assets and liabilities, her prior filing history, past and present employment and income, property interests, bank accounts, and pre-petition property transfers or sales. Notably, Ms. Hang stated under oath at the initial \u00a7 341 meeting of creditors that she had read each page of these documents before they were filed and that they contained accurate and true information.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Positions of the Parties\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    Ms. Hang's Motion\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Seeking dismissal under Rule 12(b)(1), Ms. Hang asserts that: (i) Mr. Bernier lacks standing because there is no particularized injury that is actual or imminent, (ii) her ineligibility for a discharge under \u00a7 727(a)(8) precludes the Court from affording him meaningful relief and renders this proceeding moot, (iii) the controversy is not ripe because any alleged harm is merely prospective, and (iv) Mr. Bernier will not suffer a hardship if review is denied because his request for relief is moot.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defendant's Motion to Dismiss Complaint to Deny Discharge (\"Motion,\" Doc. # 7). At their core, her arguments are that Mr. Bernier's claims fail to present a justiciable \"case or controversy,\" thereby divesting the Court of subject matter jurisdiction over this adversary proceeding.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    Mr. Bernier's Objection\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Defending against the motion, Mr. Bernier counters that Ms. Hang erroneously conflates the temporal discharge bar under \u00a7 727(a)(8) with the significantly different grounds for denial of a discharge under \u00a7 727(a)(3) and (4).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff's Objection to Motion to Dismiss (\"Objection,\" Doc. # 8). He maintains that the Court has\n   jurisdiction to hear his claims because of the \"critical distinction\" between temporary ineligibility for discharge for an objective time period and the permanency of the discharge bar effectuated by \u00a7 523(a)(10) where discharge has been denied under \u00a7 727(a)(2) through (7). Unlike the time limitations imposed by \u00a7 727(a)(8), he emphasizes, \u00a7 523(a)(10) severely sanctions a debtor for misconduct in or in connection with a particular case that undermines the integrity of the bankruptcy system. This distinction, Mr. Bernier contends, gives rise to a concrete injury for purposes of standing, which ripens his adversary proceeding for adjudication and provides the basis for meaningful relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. Dismissal Motions Under Rule 12(b)(1)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   A motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(1) may be brought by (i) accepting \"the plaintiff's version of jurisdictionally-significant facts\" while challenging their sufficiency to establish subject matter jurisdiction, or (ii) \"controverting the accuracy\" of those facts and providing \"materials of evidentiary quality in support of that position.\"\n   <em>\n    Resurgent Capital Servs., L.P. v.

The former subsections address a debtor's failure to provide truthful and complete information to the trustee and creditors. As a sanction for such abusive conduct, \u00a7 523(a)(10) renders the creditors' claims permanently nondischargeable. In contrast, \u00a7 727(a)(8) represents congressional intent to limit the frequency by which an \"honest\" debtor may obtain a discharge of debts. The punitive sanction of \u00a7 523(a)(10) does not apply. Even though \u00a7 727(a)(8) affords a creditor temporary relief from the discharge of its claims, the \"post-bankruptcy legal consequence of not entering a discharge for any reason other than the grounds specified in \u00a7 523(a)(10) for permanent nondischargeability is that the debtor remains liable for debts but might be eligible for discharge in a future chapter 7 case\" once the eight-year bar to discharge expires.\n   <em>\n    In re Filice\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12410732\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/580/259/#p263\">\n    580 B.R. at 269\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The parties have not cited to specific case law addressing whether a debtor's ineligibility under \u00a7 727(a)(8) moots an action brought under \u00a7 727(a)(2) through (7), and the Court was unable to find any cases directly on point.

Ms. Hang's characterization of the relief sought under \u00a7 727(a)(3) or (4) as simply whether a discharge is entered or denied is far too constricted; it disregards \u00a7 523(a)(10)'s permanent sanctions for the blameworthy conduct in or in connection with a particular\n    case that is the focus of these \u00a7 727(a) subsections.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     In re Filice\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12410732\" index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/580/259/#p263\">\n     580 B.R. at 263\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .

Although Mr. Bernier's claims (as well as those of all the other creditors) would soon be vulnerable to discharge in another bankruptcy case Ms. Hang could file as soon as the present one is closed, this by itself does not satisfy the hardship prong for ripeness.

In the end, denying review of his claims in this proceeding would deprive Mr. Bernier of his right to seek redress for Mr. Hang's alleged conduct in this case and to obtain the automatic, permanent nondischargeability of his claims under \u00a7 523(a)(10).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-69\">\n    Lastly, the Court would be remiss if it overlooked the important public policy issues at stake here.
