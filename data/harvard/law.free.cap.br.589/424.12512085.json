From March 2006 to May 2015, Ward served as President and Chief Executive Officer of Bank. After his employment ended, Bank uncovered questionable loan practices by Ward during his tenure as an officer and, in January 2016, filed suit against him in state court. Ward filed his chapter 7 bankruptcy petition in March 2018, which stayed the state court litigation. Bank then filed this adversary proceeding seeking a determination that debts owed by Ward as a result of his misconduct are nondischargeable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In its Complaint, Bank sets forth two causes of action regarding nondischargeability of debts. First, Bank argues Ward's debts are nondischargeable pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20523\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2)(A)\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   based on false representations and fraud. Second, Bank argues\n   Ward's debts are excepted from discharge pursuant to Section 523(a)(4) as a result of Ward's defalcation in a fiduciary capacity. Ward filed his Motion to Dismiss, arguing Bank's Complaint fails to state a claim under either Section 523(a)(2)(A) or Section 523(a)(4), and Bank filed its Response. The Court has reviewed the Complaint, Motion to Dismiss, Response, and applicable law, and for the reasons set forth below, GRANTS the Motion to Dismiss IN PART AND DENIES IT IN PART.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    JURISDICTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The Court has jurisdiction to hear this Complaint pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201334\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1334\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b), and venue is proper pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201409\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1409\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

If it appears a plaintiff has not met this requirement, a defendant may file a motion to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) (\" Rule 12(b)(6)\") (made applicable here by Federal Rule of Bankruptcy Procedure 7012 ). In\n   <em>\n    Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court ruled that a complaint \"does not need detailed factual allegations,\" but it must contain \"enough facts to state a claim to relief that is\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     plausible\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   on its face.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556136\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/550/544/\">\n    550 U.S. 544\n   </extracted-citation>\n   -45, 570,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556136\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/550/544/\">\n    127 S.Ct. 1955\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556136\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/550/544/\">\n    167 L.Ed.2d 929\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2007) (emphasis added). Thus, in\n   <em>\n    Twombly\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court formulated a \"plausibility standard\" for evaluating whether a complaint survives a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The Tenth Circuit has described the Supreme Court's plausibility standard as a middle ground that lies somewhere between \"heightened fact pleading\" and \"formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action.\"\n   <em>\n    Robbins,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3553315\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/519/1242/#p1247\">\n    519 F.3d at 1247\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The Tenth Circuit has further instructed that \"the degree of specificity necessary to establish plausibility and fair notice, and therefore the need to include sufficient factual allegations, depends on context,\" and that whether a defendant receives fair notice \"depends on the type of case.\"\n   <em>\n    Robbins\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3553315\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/519/1242/#p1247\">\n    519 F.3d at 1248\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The conception of plausibility established in\n   <em>\n    Twombly\n   </em>\n   \"refer[s] to the scope of the allegations in a complaint\" rather than the likelihood that such allegations are\n   true.\n   <em>\n    Robbins\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3553315\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/519/1242/#p1247\">\n    519 F.3d at 1247\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Bank agrees that the two-year period of limitations is correct, but disagrees as to the time its cause of action against Ward accrued. Bank correctly points out that, with respect to fraud claims, the two-year period does not begin to run from the time the losses occur, but instead from the time when the fraud is, or should have been, discovered.\n   <em>\n    Horton v.

Neither of these arguments have merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The Court agrees Bank's losses allegedly suffered as a result of Ward's misconduct are not the usual Section 523(a)(2)(A) factual scenario. However, the Supreme Court has ruled that \" \u00a7 523(a)(2)(A) is best read to prohibit the discharge of\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     any liability arising\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   from a debtor's fraudulent acquisition of money, property, etc.\"\n   <em>\n    Cohen v. de la Cruz\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11503450\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/523/213/#p220\">\n    523 U.S. 213\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 220-21,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"168136\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sct/118/1212/\">\n    118 S.Ct. 1212\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11503450\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/523/213/#p220\">\n    140 L.Ed.2d 341\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1998). In this case, Ward obtained risk-based compensation bonuses through fraudulent loan practices that also caused the Bank other financial losses. These losses fall within the Supreme Court's pronouncement that\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     any liability arising\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   from the debtor's fraudulent acquisition of money is nondischargeable under Section 523(a)(2)(A). Further, the Court disagrees that Bank has not pled dates of claimed losses with sufficient particularity. The Complaint clearly states that the misconduct goes back to at least 2004, and quantifies the Bank's losses by describing in detail at least ten separate loans made between January 30, 2004, and November 4, 2014.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Ward's arguments that Bank has not stated a claim for nondischargeability of debts under Section 523(a)(2)(A) fail, and therefore, his Motion to Dismiss is DENIED as to Count 1 of the Complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    BANK'S COMPLAINT DOES NOT STATE A CLAIM UNDER SECTION 523(a)(4)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Pursuant to Section 523(a)(4), a debtor's discharge does not apply to debts \"for fraud or defalcation while acting in a fiduciary capacity, embezzlement, or larceny.\" To state a claim under Section 523(a)(4) for fraud while acting in a fiduciary capacity, \"a plaintiff must allege that: (1) a fiduciary relationship existed between the debtor and the creditor, and (2) the debt owed to the creditor is attributable to a fraud or defalcation committed by the debtor in the course of the fiduciary relationship.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <em>\n    Burton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=463%20B.R.%20142\">\n    463 B.R. 142\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (table),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2010%20WL%203422584\">\n    2010 WL 3422584\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *5 (10th Cir.

This exception to discharge is a narrow one, and in the Tenth Circuit, an express or technical trust is required for a fiduciary relationship, and neither a general fiduciary duty of confidence, trust, loyalty, and good faith, nor an inequality between the parties, will give rise to a claim under Section 523(a)(4).\n   <em>\n    Fowler Bros.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9048718,6474167\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/91/1367/\">\n    91 F.3d at 1371-72\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Bank responds Ward ignores that, by virtue of Section 523(e), an officer of an insured depository institution is considered a fiduciary for purposes of Section 523(a)(4). Section 523(e) provides that \"[a]ny institution-affiliated party of an insured depository institution shall be considered to be acting in a fiduciary capacity with respect to the purposes of subsection (a)(4) or (11).\" Further, Section 101(33)(A) adopts the definition of \"institution-affiliated party\" contained in the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, which defines an \"institution-affiliated party\" as: \"(1) any director, officer, employee, or controlling stockholder (other than a bank holding company or savings and loan holding company) of, or agent for, an insured depository institution.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=12%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201813\">\n    12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1813\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (u). In turn, the term \"insured depository institution\" is defined as \"any bank or savings association the deposits of which are insured by the [FDIC] pursuant to this chapter.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=12%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201813\">\n    12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1813\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(2). Therefore, Bank argues that because its deposits are insured by the FDIC, Bank constitutes an insured depository institution, and Ward, as its officer and employee, is considered to be institution-affiliated party. As such, he falls within Section 523(e), and is therefore a fiduciary for purposes of Section 523(a)(4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Based on Bank's Response, it appears that Ward\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     may be\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   a fiduciary for purposes of Section 523(a)(4) by virtue of Section 523(e). However, Bank's Complaint makes no mention of Section 523(e), nor does it allege the critical fact that Bank's deposits are insured by the FDIC.
