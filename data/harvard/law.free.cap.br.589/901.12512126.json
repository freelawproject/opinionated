Funk, United States Bankruptcy Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   This proceeding is before the Court on Plaintiff FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION'S (the \"Commission's\") motion for summary judgment (Doc. 30), Defendant MICHAEL W. LANIER'S (\"Debtor's\") response in opposition (Doc. 41), the Commission's reply (Doc. 48), as well as Debtor's cross-motion for summary judgment (Docs. 44 &amp; 47), the Commission's response to Debtor's cross-motion (Doc. 49), and Debtor's reply (Doc. 50). For the reasons stated herein, the Court grants the Commission's motion and denies Debtor's cross-motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Background\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On August 30, 2016 (the \"Petition Date\"), Debtor filed a Chapter 13 petition. (Doc. 1, in Case No. 3:16-bk-3307). On February 22, 2017, the Chapter 13 case\n   was converted to a Chapter 11 case. (Doc. 99 in 3:16-bk-3307). The Commission filed a proof of claim for almost $13.6 million as to a judgment debt (the \"Judgment Debt\") resulting from litigation in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Florida (the \"District Court\"), in case number 3:14-CV-0786 (the \"Underlying Action\"). (Claim 10-1). The District Court entered an interlocutory order granting summary judgment, on July 7, 2016. (Doc. 1-3). Final summary judgment was rendered on August 12, 2016, eighteen days before the Petition Date. (Doc. 1-2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The instant Complaint seeks to except the Judgment Debt from discharge, pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20523\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2)(A). (Doc. 1). Count I is the primary count alleging nondischargeability, while Count II includes an argument for issue preclusion based on the Underlying Action. The Commission claims the Judgment Debt arises from fraudulent conduct related to a mortgage-relief services scheme. (Doc. 30-1 at 5-7).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Commission pursues a false-representation theory and an actual-fraud theory under \u00a7 523(a)(2)(A). (Doc. 30-1 at 20, 26). The Commission argues that \u00a7 523(a)(2)(A) requires the Court to except the Judgment Debt from discharge based on the fraudulent conduct for which Debtor was found liable in the Underlying Action, even if he did not personally engage in the direct fraudulent conduct himself. (Doc. 30-1 at 20-21).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In his response, Debtor asserts two essential theories of defense: 1) the independently-contracted sales staff engaged in the fraudulent activity, not Debtor himself, therefore Debtor is insulated and the debt is dischargeable; and 2) all fraudulent statements made by the sales staff were oral statements \"respecting\" Debtor's \"financial condition\" and, therefore, the debt is dischargeable, citing\n   <em>\n    In re Appling\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12272708,12277812\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/848/953/\">\n    848 F.3d 953\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (11th Cir. 2017). Debtor contends the \"[p]hone solicitation 'conversations' with consumers facing mortgage foreclosure focused upon [Debtor]'s law practice business model and the financial strategy of his foreclosure defense law practice.\" (Doc. 41 at 6). Debtor contends the \"details of his professional strategy and the success rate that he enjoyed certainly 'impacted on' his financial condition reflecting 'his overall financial status.' \" (Doc. 41 at 6); (Docs. 47 &amp; 44). Debtor attached an affidavit to his reply in support of his cross-motion, which the Court fully considered in determining the present issues. (Doc. 50 at 7-19).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Undisputed Facts\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The Commission sued Debtor (who is a Florida attorney)\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   and his law firms, Lanier Law and Liberty &amp; Trust Law Group of Florida, among other codefendants, for violating the FTC Act, the Telemarketing Sales Rule, and the Mortgage Assistance Relief Services Rule (MARS Rule or Regulation O). The essential allegations were that the defendants misrepresented their ability to obtain mortgage modifications and reduce loan obligations, charged consumers disallowed advance fees for mortgage relief services, failed to communicate required disclosures to customers and potential customers, and initiated impermissible outbound telephone sales calls.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The District Court entered a 78-page interlocutory order granting summary judgment (the \"Interlocutory Order\") (Doc. 1-3) and a final order of summary judgment (the \"Final Order\") (Doc. 1-2). The Final Order enjoined Debtor and his codefendants from engaging in various practices, entered a joint-and-several money judgment against Debtor and his codefendants, appointed an agent to liquidate Debtor's assets and turn over the proceeds to the Commission, and imposed standards for Debtor's (and his codefendants') compliance reporting. (Doc. 1-2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <em>\n    The common enterprise.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Debtor's codefendants included his law firms, other attorneys, and other law firms. The District Court concluded that this group of law firms and attorneys operated as a \"common enterprise.\" (Doc. 1-3 at 43). The common enterprise used independently contracted sales staff to market mortgage relief services to consumers, and used contracted of-counsel attorneys to expand operations throughout the nation. (Doc. 1-3 at 43); (Doc. 1-3 at 15). It appears the codefendants had hoped the independent nature of the sales staff and the of-counsel attorneys would insulate the members of the common enterprise against liability. As detailed below, the consumers were led to believe they would receive legal representation from the codefendants through local of-counsel attorneys, while the contracted of-counsel attorneys were told they were responsible only for document review and that they did not represent the consumers. Ultimately, none of the consumers received the legal representation that was promised.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <em>\n    The staffing agencies and salesforce personnel.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Specifically, the District Court concluded the law firms \"used separate companies, such as DOLMF,\n   <sup>\n    [\n   </sup>\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   <sup>\n    ]\n   </sup>\n   Pinnacle, and FURF\n   <sup>\n    [\n   </sup>\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   <sup>\n    ]\n   </sup>\n   (the 'staffing' agencies), to solicit consumers, answer calls from consumers, and convince consumers to retain a law firm's services.\" (Doc. 1-3 at 23) (footnotes added). In the Underlying Action, the Commission presented \"declarations from over sixty consumers who largely recount similar experiences with Lanier Law, the DC Entities\n   <sup>\n    [\n   </sup>\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   <sup>\n    ]\n   </sup>\n   and Liberty &amp; Trust (the Law Firms).\" (Doc. 1-3 at 27) (footnote added). \"[T]hese declarations describe conversations with salespersons which were replete with misrepresentations about the Law Firms.\" (Doc. 1-3 at 27). \"In these introductory conversations, either the initial contact person or the case manager would tell the consumer that the Law Firm could obtain a loan modification for the consumer with significantly lower payments and a lower interest rate.\" (Doc. 1-3 at 28). \"Sometimes, the representative would specifically state the amount of the anticipated reduced mortgage payment, and/or that the interest rate would be lowered to 2 or 3%.\" (Doc. 1-3 at 28). \"Many consumers were told that the Law Firm could get the consumer a reduction in principal, removal of fees, or amounts past due wiped away.\" (Doc. 1-3 at 28). \"Some consumers recall that they were even 'promised'\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   or 'guaranteed' a loan modification.\" (Doc. 1-3 at 29).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \"Consumers were often reassured that the Law Firm[s] had success rates upwards of 80 and 90%.\" (Doc. 1-3 at 29). \"Sometimes representatives convinced consumers that these modifications were possible by explaining that the firm would perform an 'audit' or examination of their loan documents to find errors made by the lender which would increase the consumer's bargaining power or even 'require' the lender to approve a modification.\" (Doc. 1-3 at 29). \"In some cases, consumers were told that they had been 'approved' or that they 'qualified' for programs designed to keep them in their homes.\" (Doc. 1-3 at 29). \"Many consumers believed, and some were explicitly told, that a lawyer would work on their case, and some consumers were specifically told that they needed the help of a lawyer to obtain a loan modification.\" (Doc. 1-3 at 30). \"In reliance on the foregoing or similar representations, even skeptical consumers were eventually persuaded to hire one of the Law Firms to save their homes.\" (Doc. 1-3 at 30).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <em>\n    The of-counsel attorney network.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The District Court concluded the \"principals of Lanier Law and the DC Entities associated 'of counsel' attorneys in other states so that these businesses could expand their operations to those states.\" (Doc. 1-3 at 15). \"As such, the client agreements that Lanier Law and the DC Entities provided to consumers refer to the law firm retaining 'outside counsel' or working with 'counsel local to Client,' to provide the consumer with legal representation.\" (Doc. 1-3 at 15).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Seven of these of-counsel attorneys submitted declarations to be used as summary-judgment evidence in the Underlying Action. (Doc. 1-3 at 17-19). These attorneys generally did not contact client-consumers or confer with any banks, lenders, or mortgage servicers on the clients' behalf. (Doc. 1-3 at 18). \"Some of these attorneys assert that Lanier specifically told them that the work only involved reviewing files 'to see that they were properly completed, signed and dated,' with 'no litigation, no court appearances, and no legal research.' \" (Doc. 1-3 at 18). \"Some of these attorneys do recall being asked to review pleadings that a consumer would file in court pro se. However, the review was largely editorial, correcting typographical errors, grammar, syntax and formatting.\" (Doc. 1-3 at 19). The District Court concluded the of-counsel attorneys did not provide actual legal representation to any of the client-consumers, with respect to foreclosure-defense or loan-modification matters. (Doc. 1-3 at 17-23).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <em>\n    Debtor's involvement in the deceptive practices.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The District Court concluded that Debtor held \"sole ownership interest in the Lanier Law entities as well as Liberty &amp; Trust.\" (Doc. 1-3 at 72). \"Moreover, Lanier admitted in his Guilty Plea to the Florida Bar that he had supervisory responsibility over DOLMF and Pinnacle [i.e., staffing agencies] during the time period that those entities worked for him.\" (Doc. 1-3 at 73). \"Although [Debtor] did not hold an express contractual interest in the DC Entities, the email records establish that [Debtor] still actively participated in the conduct of those companies and exercised control over their affairs.\" (Doc. 1-3 at 73 &amp; 43). The undisputed evidence further \"establishe[d] that [Debtor] was aware that consumers were being misled by virtue of the Florida Bar grievance proceedings, consumer complaints to the Better Business Bureau (BBB), as well as the inquiries he received from consumer protection departments in various states.\" (Doc. 1-3 at 73) (citations omitted). In light of this, the District Court found \"ample evidence to conclude that [Debtor] had authority to control and actively participated\n   in the affairs of the common enterprise, and was entirely aware of the misrepresentations made to consumers.\" (Doc. 1-3 at 73).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <em>\n    The District Court's conclusions of fraud.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The Court concluded, \"[t]o the extent consumers were led to believe that an attorney would assist them in obtaining a loan modification, such representations were false when made.\" (Doc. 1-3 at 41). \"Many of the consumers report that once they began paying a Law Firm, they stopped hearing from them, their calls were not answered or returned, they were transferred to new case managers, and it became difficult to communicate with anyone at the [respective] Firm.\" (Doc. 1-3 at 37). \"Notably, neither Lanier Law nor the DC Entities present[ed] evidence of\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   consumer who received a loan modification substantially reducing their monthly payment or who otherwise was satisfied with Defendants' services.\" (Doc. 1-3 at 39) (underlining in original).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \"The Law Firms operated using a business model where 'of counsel' attorneys had no substantive role in the loan modification process because the Law Firms rarely, if ever, referred clients to those attorneys to perform that function. Indeed, the 'of counsel' attorneys report that it was [Debtor] who described to them their limited responsibilities, and [one such attorney] recounts that [Debtor] instructed him that [he] had no fiduciary relationship to the Law Firms' clients.\" (Doc. 1-3 at 41). \"[Debtor] does not deny these statements. ... [T]he 'of counsel' attorneys were led to believe that their sole function was document review, and they would be contacted if additional work was necessary. Indeed, it appears the Law Firms actually impeded contact between the 'of counsel' attorneys and consumers.\" (Doc. 1-3 at 41). \"The evidence before the Court is sufficient to establish that consumers were led to believe that they would have legal representation in the loan modification process and such statements were false or misleading, not because the 'of counsel' attorneys failed to fulfill their responsibilities, but because of the manner in which the Law Firms utilized their 'of counsel network.' \" (Doc. 1-3 at 41-42).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The Interlocutory Order goes on, \"Plainly, members of the common enterprise made numerous misrepresentations to consumers.\" (Doc. 1-3 at 51). \"Perhaps the most egregious example of deceptive conduct by Lanier Law and the DC Entities is the use of the Economic Stimulus Flyer ....\" (Doc. 1-3 at 51). \"This solicitation is clearly misleading in that it is titled a 'Payment Reduction' or 'Mortgage Relief' Notification, references an 'Economic Stimulus,' and is designed to appear as an official notice from the government.' \" (Doc. 1-3 at 51). \"Although the Flyer disclaims any affiliation with the government, the consumer is left with the impression that a non-profit organization has determined that he is eligible for government assistance with his mortgage, and the consumer need only complete a registration process to receive this assistance.\" (Doc. 1-3 at 52). \"As such, everything about this Flyer is deceptive and misleading.\" (Doc. 1-3 at 52). The 78-page Interlocutory Order discusses further examples of fraud and misrepresentation, which the Court has duly considered and taken into account. The Court omits these additional portions simply for brevity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Standard for Summary Judgment\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The chief question at summary judgment is whether there is sufficient conflicting evidence to warrant a trial.

While it is true that many nondischargeability suits involve a debtor who directly engaged in fraudulent conduct, requiring such direct involvement impermissibly imputes language into the statute that is not present.
