Nelson Industrial Steam Co.\n   </em>\n   , 2015-1439 (La. 5/3/16),\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6804172\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/190/276/\">\n    190 So.3d 276\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , explained the difference:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   According to the leading Louisiana sales tax treatise, a \"tax exemption is a provision that exempts from tax a transaction that would, in the absence of the exemption, otherwise be subject to tax.

Debtor argues that the provision excludes the transactions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Based on existing jurisprudence, the State might have taxed the transactions in question. However, it clearly elected to\n   forebear from this option. By narrowly defining \"retail sale,\" the State excluded sales of movables intended for resale to the United States government. The transaction was removed from taxation\n   <em>\n    ab initio\n   </em>\n   because the tax is only imposed on retail sales. For this reason, the Court finds that the provisions of La. R.S. 47:301(10)(g) are exclusions to be construed liberally in favor of Debtor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   LDR cites as authority for its position\n   <em>\n    Bridges v.

In\n   <em>\n    Cepolk\n   </em>\n   , a heating and air conditioning contractor for the United States military (\"Cepolk\") installed heating and air conditioning systems at Fort Polk and continued to maintain those systems after installation. Cepolk claimed that equipment and materials used in the maintenance of the systems were not subject to taxation because they was purchased with the intent to resell to the United States. LDR argued that the contract was for construction and the materials or equipment were not for resale but instead consumed in connection with the services and labor provided. Ultimately, the Circuit Court agreed, finding that the taxpayer was a contractor and the tangible property it used in connection with its services was not acquired for resale but consumed as part of its construction services. In its opinion, the Court referred to La. R.S. 47:301(10)(g) as an \"exemption\" from taxation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The\n   <em>\n    Cepolk\n   </em>\n   decision turned on Cepolk's status either as a contractor under La. R.S. 47:301(10)(a)(i) or a dealer under La. R.S. 47:314. If Cepolk was a contractor, the movables used in the services it provided were consumed rather than sold.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   If it were a dealer the movables might be subject to resale. Only if Cepolk were a dealer, would 47:301(10)(g) apply. Because the Court found Cepolk was a contractor consuming movables in connection with its services, the application of La. R.S. 47:301(10)(g) ceased to be relevant to the decision. Therefore, any references to La. R.S. 47:301(10)(g)'s character as an exemption versus exclusion cannot be considered part of the Court's holding nor are they persuasive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Odebrecht Construction Inc. v. Department of Revenue\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015-0013%20%28La.App.%201%20Cir.%209/18/15%29\">\n    2015-0013 (La.App. 1 Cir. 9/18/15)\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6766309\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/182/132/\">\n    182 So.3d 132\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , a case factually close to the one at hand, the First Circuit reviewed an appeal from the Louisiana Board of Tax Appeal. The case involved a subcontractor for the Corps of Engineers (\"Corps\"). The subcontractor claimed that purchases of clay were excluded from sales tax under La. R.S. 47:301(10)(g). There was no question that the purchases involved movables and that title to them passed to the Corps on delivery by the taxpayer. The question before the Court was whether or not the subsection was an exemption or exclusion. The Board of Tax Appeal held:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   [Section] 301(10) involves the definition of a retail sale and paragraph (g) specifically defines a category of transactions that are not included within the definition of \"sale at retail.\" This paragraph operates as [an] exclusion not as a tax exemption. Since the subsection at issue is an 'exclusion' and not a tax exemption, therefore any question about the applicability of the exclusion must be resolved in favor of the Taxpayer.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6766309\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/182/132/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6766309\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/182/132/\">\n    at 136\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The First Circuit agreed finding:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   La.

The Department's argument that Section 47:301(10)(g) is an exemption cannot be reconciled with the language of the statute.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6766309\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/182/132/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6766309\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/182/132/\">\n    at 143\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Bridges v. Nelson Industrial Steam Co.\n   </em>\n   , 2015-1439 (La. 5/3/16),\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6804172\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/190/276/\">\n    190 So.3d 276\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , the Louisiana Supreme Court considered whether La. R.S. 47:301(10)(a)(i)(c)(i)(aa) was an exemption or an exclusion. Commonly referred to as the \"further processing exclusion,\" the Court considered whether the provision should be construed liberally in favor of the taxpayer or strictly in favor of the State. In\n   <em>\n    Nelson\n   </em>\n   as in this case, LDR argued that every sale is subject to taxation unless exempted; therefore, the provision not to tax must be an exemption. A plain reading of the defined term \"retail sale\" resulted in a ruling that the transaction was excluded from retail sales. Therefore, the statute created an exclusion, not an exemption.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   The foregoing decisions establish that when a type of transaction is removed from the definition of transactions subject to tax, the effect is to exclude. In this case, sales to the Corps or its agents are not considered retail sales. As a result, they are not included in the category of transactions subject to tax. Although LDR argues that they are exempted rather than excluded, to be exempt from tax would require that the transaction first be subject to tax. The Legislature did not elect this option. Therefore, the Court holds that La. R.S. 47:301(10)(g) is an exclusion to be liberally construed in favor of Debtor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <strong>\n    B. The Burden of Proving Application of La. R.S. 47:301(10)(g)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   LDR's claims are a result of audits conducted on Debtor's business operations from January 31, 2009, through June 30, 2012, and January 1, 2014, through April 30, 2017. The audits uncovered transactions between Debtor and third parties for the sale of clay and for which sales tax was not paid. Debtor asserts the transactions fall within the confines of La. R.S. 47:301(10)(g), are not taxable, and LDR bears the burden of proving they are taxable. LDR claims that all transactions by a dealer are presumed to be retail sales. Therefore, Debtor bears the burden of proving the transactions are excluded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   The burden of proof is a substantive aspect of a claim. As an essential element of the claim itself, the parties are entitled to the burden of proof normally imposed.\n   <em>\n    Raleigh v. Illinois Department of Revenue\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9413110\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/530/15/\">\n    530 U.S. 15\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11508662,9413110\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/120/1951/\">\n    120 S.Ct. 1951\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9413110\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/530/15/\">\n    147 L.Ed.2d 13\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2000). Thus, state law controls which party bears the burden of proof on the issues.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Generally, the burden is on a plaintiff in a civil action to establish a\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   case. The opposing party need not supply any countervailing evidence until this is done. If the plaintiff fails, his cause of action will be defeated. If a plaintiff succeeds in establishing a\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   case, the burden will shift to the defendant to overcome the initial allegations then back to the plaintiff to prove his case by preponderance of evidence. Once plaintiff proves his case by a preponderance of\n   evidence, the burden returns to the defendant to eliminate an element of the claim or prove a defense by evidence sufficient to overcome plaintiff's proof.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Dupre v.

Therefore, LDR asserts that it is Debtor's burden to establish, by a preponderance of evidence, that the assessed sales tax is not due. LDR cites\n   <em>\n    Barfield v.

When the State elects to collect an assessed tax by summary proceeding, state law allows LDR's pleadings, affidavits sworn to be true and correct, and audits to be given the effect of evidence. La.R.S. 13:5034 is in fact the statute that implements that procedure. However, when the matter is through ordinary process, the rules of evidence apply, and LDR must produce admissible evidence under the applicable rules of procedure in order to carry its burden.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   In summary, LDR bears the burden of establishing any transaction is subject to taxation. If a taxpayer maintains records sufficient to make a showing that the transactions audited by LDR are excluded under La. R.S. 47:301(10)(g), in most cases, extrinsic evidence to establish the exclusion will not be necessary. The burden will fall on LDR to prove why the transactions do not meet the parameters of the exclusion by a preponderance of evidence. However, if the taxpayer's records are insufficient to support the exclusion on their face, the presumption that the transactions are subject to tax arises, and the taxpayer bears the burden of rebutting the presumption. As a consequence, the burden will shift to Debtor to prove that the transactions are not retail sales. Once Debtor introduces evidence sufficient to rebut LDR's presumption, it will be incumbent upon LDR to establish by preponderance of evidence that the exclusions do not apply.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Although the parties request that this Court detail what proof might be necessary to carry their burdens, the Court will not speculate on the answer to this question.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   <strong>\n    C.

Assessed But Uncollected Sales Taxes\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   LDR asserts that Debtor owes sales tax on transactions in which it failed to collect the tax.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   La. R.S. 47:304 provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-106\">\n   C. Dealers shall, as far as practicable, add the amount of the tax imposed under this chapter in conformity with the schedule or schedules to be prescribed by the collector pursuant to authority conferred herein, to the sale price of charge, which shall be a debt from the purchaser or consumer to the dealer, until paid, and shall be recoverable at law in the same manner as other debts. Any dealer who neglects, fails, or refuses to collect the tax herein provided, shall be liable for any pay the tax himself.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-107\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-108\">\n   I. The sums of money collected by the dealer for payment of sales and use taxes imposed by the state of Louisiana, ... shall be and remain the property of the taxing authority and deemed held in trust for the taxing authority.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   La. R.S. 47:304 is clear that if a dealer fails to collect sales tax, the dealer must pay the tax itself and that all sums collected\n   are property of the state held in trust by the dealer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   The only defense to a failure to collect a tax legally owed occurs when the item is returned to the dealer. In that case, La. R.S. 47:315 provides that the dealer is entitled to a credit or refund of the tax. Debtor asserts that in some cases, the amount of product sold was disputed by the purchaser. As a result, the actual amount of clay sold was less than invoiced. Provided Debtor establishes that a lesser amount of clay was actually sold than was invoiced, the sales tax assessed on the invoice would have to be decreased. Sales tax is based on retail sales of product. For the portion of product not delivered, no sale occurred. Ergo, no tax is due.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   La.R.S.47:301 (10(g) excludes from the definition of retail sales, certain transactions with the United States government. As an exclusion, it is liberally construed in favor of the taxpayer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   The burden of proof is on LDR to establish that the transactions in question are retail sales subject to tax. That burden might be initially met through the presumption created by La. R.S. 47:314. However, if Debtor offers evidence to establish facts sufficient to support a contrary conclusion, LDR's presumption will be defeated. It will then be LDR's burden to establish by preponderance of the evidence that the exclusion does not apply.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   Separately stated freight charges are not included in the sales price subject to sales or use tax.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   The burden is on LDR to establish that an out of state tax was illegally assessed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   The dealer is liable for sales tax on completed retail sales.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   A separate, Partial Judgment will be rendered in accord with this Opinion.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-120\">\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Claiborne Sales Co. v.
