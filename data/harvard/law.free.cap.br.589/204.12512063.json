Funk, United States Bankruptcy Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   This proceeding is before the Court on the amended motion to dismiss filed by\n   Defendant FLORIDA AGENCY FOR HEALTH CARE ADMINISTRATION (\"AHCA\") (Doc. 10) and the response in opposition filed by Plaintiff INSTITUTE OF CARDIOVASCULAR EXCELLENCE, PLLC (\"Debtor\") (Doc. 11). For the reasons stated herein, AHCA's motion is denied as to Count 1, but is granted as to Counts 2 and 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Debtor filed a voluntary petition under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code on April 20, 2016. Debtor filed the instant adversary proceeding and complaint on November 8, 2017, naming AHCA as the sole defendant. (Doc. 1). AHCA is Florida's executive-branch agency responsible for, among other things, operating and managing Florida's Medicaid program and disbursement of federal Medicaid funds.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Debtor is a limited liability company and provider of medical services within the State of Florida.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    ALLEGATIONS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The complaint alleges the following facts, which the Court accepts as true for purposes of AHCA's motion to dismiss. In January 2009, Debtor and AHCA entered into a Medicaid Provider Agreement (the \"Provider Agreement\"), which obligated AHCA to reimburse Debtor for medical services it provided to Medicaid recipients within the terms of the agreement. (Doc. 1 at 2). Pursuant to the Provider Agreement, Debtor performed medical services on Medicaid recipients and AHCA was, in turn, obligated by the Provider Agreement to pay Debtor $294,736.25. Debtor alleges that AHCA has neither paid the claims nor notified Debtor of any denied or contested claim, as required by section 641.3155(3)(b), Florida Statutes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   At some point, Debtor communicated with AHCA in an attempt to collect on the funds due under the Provider Agreement. AHCA responded that the funds are \"being held in suspended accounts.\" (Doc. 1 at 2). At the time, AHCA contended these funds were forfeited or abandoned by virtue of a settlement agreement between Debtor (as well as related entities/individuals) and state and federal government agencies in connection with a Medicaid fraud investigation. AHCA also apparently contended that state and federal law required it to \"suspend\" the subject accounts and withhold payment in light of the fraud investigation. AHCA has not paid the monies owed to Debtor and has not \"notified\" Debtor of a \"denied or contested claim within 20 days\" thereof. AHCA's failure to pay or deny the claim has created an \"uncontestable obligation\" to pay the claim plus interest, under section 641.3155(3)(b), Florida Statutes. (Doc. 1 at 3, \u00b6 11). Based on these allegations, Debtor brings three counts: 1) turnover of property under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20542\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 542\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; 2) common law breach of contract; and 3) common law quantum meruit. (Doc. 1 at 3-6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   AHCA's motion to dismiss argues that it retains Eleventh Amendment immunity for these claims, and that the proceeding should be dismissed. (Doc. 10). More specifically, AHCA concedes that the Eleventh Amendment does not immunize it against a \"true\" turnover claim under \u00a7 542, but argues the claims are actually immunized claims for\n   <em>\n    in personam\n   </em>\n   damages masquerading as a non-immunized \u00a7 542 turnover claim. (Doc. 10 at 5).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   AHCA also asserts two factual arguments going to the merits of Debtor's claims. First, AHCA contends that, in 2015, a medical doctor associated with Debtor came under investigation for Medicaid\n   fraud. At the time, AHCA determined it had \"reliable evidence\" to warrant withholding Medicaid payments to Debtor pursuant to section 409.913(25)(a), Florida Statutes, and\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20455.23\">\n    42 C.F.R. \u00a7 455.23\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Second, AHCA contends that, even if it lifted the suspension of payments, Debtor would be entitled to only $28,441.68. (Doc. 10-1 at 3). AHCA attached an affidavit of a designated representative as well as a letter, dated May 5, 2015, which purports to have informed Debtor that AHCA \"is temporarily withholding\" provider payments due to Debtor. (Doc. 10-1 at 5). This evidence is outside the four corners of the complaint, and the Court is unable to consider its impact on the merits of Debtor's claims within the present analysis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   A motion brought pursuant to Rule 12(b)(1) asks the Court to determine whether a sufficient basis for subject-matter jurisdiction has been pled in the operative complaint. Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(1) ; Fed. R. Bankr. P. 7012(b).

On the other hand, AHCA contends the money was forfeited due to a settlement agreement reached in a related Medicaid fraud investigation (i.e., an agreement extraneous to the Provider Agreement) and further contends the money was lawfully withheld, at least at first, pursuant to section 409.913(25)(a), Florida Statutes, and\n   <extracted-citation index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20455.23\">\n    42 C.F.R. \u00a7 455.23\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Nevertheless, the point is that the central conflict in this proceeding is whether and to what extent Debtor and the bankruptcy estate maintain a property interest in the subject funds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Put differently, looking at the substance of the claim, Count 1 asks the Court to exercise only\n   <em>\n    in rem\n   </em>\n   jurisdiction and adjudicate whether the bankruptcy estate retains an interest in the subject funds. In determining whether the estate maintains an interest in the subject funds, the Court need not exercise\n   <em>\n    in personam\n   </em>\n   jurisdiction over AHCA.\n   <em>\n    Cf.

Such exclusive\n   <em>\n    in rem\n   </em>\n   jurisdiction includes the jurisdiction to determine whether the property is property of the estate-Eleventh Amendment notwithstanding. Thus, the Court retains jurisdiction to adjudicate Count 1 and determine whether the subject funds are property of the estate but does not retain jurisdiction to assess\n   <em>\n    in personam\n   </em>\n   liability against AHCA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Common law breach of contract and quantum meruit.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Debtor's two state-law claims (i.e., Counts 2 and 3) are barred by the Eleventh Amendment because adjudication of these particular claims is not \"necessary to effectuate the\n   <em>\n    in rem\n   </em>\n   jurisdiction of the bankruptcy courts.' \"\n   <em>\n    Diaz\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4182327,6050703\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/647/1073/\">\n    647 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1084 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Charter Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6122936,10540508\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/913/1575/\">\n    913 F.2d at 1579\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In other words, accepting the allegations of Counts 2 and 3 as true and rendering judgment in favor of Debtor on these counts would require the Court to assess\n   <em>\n    in personam\n   </em>\n   liability against AHCA in violation of the Eleventh Amendment. Florida's ratification of the U.S. Constitution does not operate as consent to be sued on these state-law claims in this Court and AHCA is, therefore, immunized as to these causes of action in this Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   In sum, the extent of the Court's jurisdiction in this proceeding is solely\n   <em>\n    in rem\n   </em>\n   jurisdiction over property of the bankruptcy estate. This includes the jurisdiction to determine whether and to what extent the subject funds constitute a matured debt owed as of the petition-filing date. If the evidence presented proves the subject funds are property of the estate and AHCA's withholding of funds is not otherwise legally justified, the Court would be required to order turnover of those funds to Debtor, as the debtor-in-possession, without interference of the Eleventh Amendment. Likewise, if the evidence demonstrates the estate retains no interest in the funds, the Court would be without further jurisdiction in this proceeding because the Eleventh Amendment precludes\n   any exercise of\n   <em>\n    in personam\n   </em>\n   jurisdiction over AHCA as well as any assessment of liability for damages against AHCA, under these circumstances.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Accordingly, AHCA's motion to dismiss is GRANTED as to Counts 2 and 3 but is DENIED as to Count 1. Counts 2 and 3 are hereby DISMISSED. The parties shall proceed accordingly.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   ORDERED.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-42\">\n    <em>\n     http://ahca.myflorida.com/Medicaid/\n    </em>\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-43\">\n    U.S. Const. art.

This Order focuses solely on the \"consent by ratification\" theory. The \"litigation waiver\" theory is inapplicable because AHCA has not filed a proof of claim in the main case.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-45\">\n    <em>\n     http://pacer.flmb.uscourts.gov/administrativeorders/DataFileOrder.asp?FileID=44\n    </em>\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
