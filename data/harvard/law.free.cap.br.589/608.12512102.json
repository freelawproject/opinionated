Wood, United States District Judge\n   Plaintiff-Appellee Mark Simon filed a complaint in Arizona state court against Defendants-Appellants Constantino Joseph Boccarsi and Cari Ann Coglianese (the \"Debtors\") asserting a claim for securities fraud under Arizona law. Ultimately, a default judgment was entered against the Debtors. When the Debtors later filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy, they sought to discharge the debt arising from the default judgment. However, Simon filed an adversary complaint before the Bankruptcy Court and moved for summary judgment, arguing that the debt was not dischargeable under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20523\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(19). The Bankruptcy Court granted his motion and the Debtors now appeal. For the reasons explained below, this Court affirms the Bankruptcy Court's decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The material facts before the Bankruptcy Court were undisputed. Because the Court reviews the Bankruptcy Court's findings of fact for clear error, the Court takes the following facts from the Bankruptcy Court's Memorandum Opinion on Simon's Motion for Summary Judgment (R. 294-313, Dkt. No. 10-4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On May 16, 2008, Simon filed a verified complaint against several parties, including the Debtors, in Arizona state court. According to the complaint, Boccarsi approached Simon in May 2006 regarding a unique and promising investment opportunity in a stock-trading program. Boccarsi further told Simon that the program had \"never had a losing day,\" that \"no investor had ever lost any money\" in the program, and that participation in the program \"enabled investors to realize lucrative short-term profits.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Following this initial approach, another defendant named in the state court complaint, Allen J. White, called Simon three or four times in May 2006 to encourage Simon to invest in the stock-trading program. White also drafted an Investor Agreement to secure Simon's investment. White assured Simon that the agreement would protect everyone who participated in the program. Based on his interactions with Boccarsi and White, Simon decided to participate in the stock-trading program and transferred $100,000 to Boccarsi on May 22, 2006. However, Boccarsi informed Simon that he needed to contribute another $100,000 under the Investor Agreement. Boccarsi again assured Simon of the \"inherent success\" of the program. Based on those representations, Simon agreed to transfer an additional $100,000 to Boccarsi.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   According to the complaint, at all relevant times, Boccarsi was not an investment advisor. The complaint also alleged that Boccarsi never invested Simon's funds in a stock-trading program as promised and did not even have access to any such program. In February 2007, Simon demanded Boccarsi return all the money he transferred to him. But Boccarsi informed Simon that due to trading losses, only $37,000 of his initial investment remained. Boccarsi eventually returned $34,000 to Simon in mid-2007.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Simon's state court complaint set forth five claims against Boccarsi. Two were ultimately dismissed, leaving claims for securities fraud, common law fraud, and negligent misrepresentation-all under Arizona law. On May 15, 2009, counsel for the\n   Debtors filed a motion to withdraw from the state court action. In that motion, withdrawing counsel certified that the Debtors had been notified about the status of their case, given the dates and times of upcoming court hearings, informed of the need to comply with court orders, and warned of the possibility of sanctions for non-compliance with court orders. Nonetheless, the Debtors subsequently missed a court proceeding that they had been ordered to attend. As a result, the state court struck the Debtors' answer to Simon's complaint. Then, on November 24, 2010, the court entered a default judgment against the Debtors and awarded Simon $243,359. That judgment was amended on May 19, 2011 to make clear that it was a final judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On September 14, 2016, the Debtors filed a voluntary petition for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in the Bankruptcy Court. They listed Simon as a creditor with an unsecured claim. Simon filed an adversary complaint against the Debtors seeking a determination from the Bankruptcy Court that the Debtors' debt to Simon was non-dischargeable. Simon then moved for summary judgment based on his claim that the debt was non-dischargeable under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20523\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(19) because it arose from a judgment for securities fraud under Arizona Revised Statutes \u00a7 44-1991. The Bankruptcy Court agreed and entered summary judgment in Simon's favor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In its order granting summary judgment, the Bankruptcy Court held that the Debtors forfeited their ability to contest the facts in the state court complaint by defaulting, and the complaint sufficiently established that the Debtors' debt arose out of a violation of state securities law. Moreover, while normally a default judgment would not be given preclusive effect under the common law doctrine of collateral estoppel, the Bankruptcy Court found that the plain language of \u00a7 523(a)(19) preempted the normal common law doctrine and gave preclusive effect to any judgment, including a default judgment. The Debtors now appeal the Bankruptcy Court's determination that the state court complaint established that the Debtors violated Arizona securities law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20158\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 158\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), federal district courts have jurisdiction to review bankruptcy court decisions.

In particular, they contend that the complaint did not state a claim for securities fraud with particularity as required by Arizona's analog of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 9(b).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Green v.

Ct. App. 2009). However, Simon contends that no such analysis is necessary, as the default judgment conclusively establishes the Debtors' liability on each cause of action. The Court does not find it necessary to resolve this disagreement, as the allegations in the state court complaint sufficiently establish securities fraud.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Under Arizona Revised Statutes \u00a7 44-1991, it is a fraudulent and unlawful practice to \"[e]mploy any device, scheme or artifice to defraud\" or \"[m]ake any untrue statement of material fact\" in connection with an offer to buy or sell securities or a sale or purchase of securities. With\n   respect to false statements, it is sufficient that the statements were material and misleading.\n   <em>\n    Aaron v. Fromkin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"208673\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/196/224/\">\n    196 Ariz. 224\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"208673\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/196/224/\">\n    994 P.2d 1039\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1042 (Ariz.

Simon points to numerous material false statements made by Boccarsi. Most prominently, Boccarsi told Simon that the funds would be invested in a stock-trading program, but they never were. Indeed, Boccarsi did not even have access to a stock-trading program in which to invest the funds. Moreover, Boccarsi represented that the (non-existent) program never had a losing day, no investor had ever lost any money in the program, and it enabled investors to realize lucrative short-term profits. Those statements were false and certainly material. And because those statements alone \"plead[ed] all the essential elements of fraud,\" Simon met the pleading standard of Arizona's version of Rule 9(b).\n   <em>\n    Steinberger v. McVey ex rel. Cty. of Maricopa\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4322733\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/234/125/\">\n    234 Ariz. 125\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4322733\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/234/125/\">\n    318 P.3d 419\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 435 (Ariz.

Thus, Simon's complaint adequately set forth a claim for securities fraud and therefore the Debtors' debt was one for a violation of state securities law.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Finally, the Debtors briefly suggest in a footnote that the complaint before the Bankruptcy Court contradicts the claim of securities fraud because it alleges that Boccarsi embezzled the $200,000 that was the subject of the securities fraud. Yet the Debtors do not explain why those allegations are contradictory. Indeed, the securities fraud could have been consummated prior to Boccarsi obtaining the $200,000, and the fact that he subsequently failed to invest that money does not negate his fraud.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    SEC v.
