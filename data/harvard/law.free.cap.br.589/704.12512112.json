The apparent overlap between the parties to this involuntary bankruptcy proceeding and the two civil proceedings in State Court is described below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    1.\n    <em>\n     The Involuntary Bankruptcy Proceeding.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On May 18, 2017, an involuntary petition under Chapter 11 (ECF No. 1) was filed against EBH.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The involuntary petition (\"Petition\")\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   was filed on behalf of seven entities: (1) GLAS in its capacity as Administrative Agent on behalf of each of the \"PIK Lenders,\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   (2) GoldenTree Master Fund, Ltd. (\"GoldenTree\"), (3) Kneiff Tower SARL, (4) Mount Kellett Master Fund II-A, LP, (5) Grace Bay III Holdings S.a.r.l., (6) Arvo Investment Holdings S.a.r.l., and (7) Sound Point Montauk Fund, L.P. (collectively \"Petitioning Creditors\"). The Petition follows Bankruptcy Official Form 205, and Part 3, at Paragraph 11, alleges that \"The debtor is generally not paying its debts as they become due, unless they are the subject of a bona fide dispute as to liability or amount.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On May 19, 2017, a summons was issued by this court requiring EBH to respond to\n   the Petition within 21 days after service. The summons also indicated that an initial status conference had been scheduled for June 21, 2017. (ECF No. 55). On May 24, 2017, an order was entered approving a stipulation to continue the initial status conference to June 27, 2017. (ECF No. 67).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On June 9, 2017, EBH timely responded to the Petition by filing the instant Dismissal Motion. (ECF No. 73). The request for judicial notice accompanying the motion includes thirty-two separate exhibits. Those exhibits consist entirely of papers filed in connection with the previously mentioned civil actions pending in State Court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   A hearing on the Dismissal Motion was noticed to be held on July 20, 2017. (ECF No. 75). The motion requests this bankruptcy court to terminate this involuntary bankruptcy case by dismissing the Petition. In the alternative, the motion requests that this bankruptcy court abstain from further proceedings on the Petition to permit the completion of the State Court Litigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On June 22, 2017, an opposition to the Dismissal Motion was filed on behalf of GLAS (\"GLAS Opposition\"). (ECF No. 81).\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On June 26, 2017, an opposition to the Dismissal Motion also was filed on behalf of the \"PIK Lender Group.\" (ECF No. 89). The request for judicial notice accompanying that opposition (\"PIK Lender Opposition\") includes three exhibits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On June 27, 2017, this court entered an order approving a stipulation granting relief from the automatic stay to permit all of the parties in the coordinated civil actions to continue with the State Court Litigation, including any appeals.

(Supp. RJN-EBH Ex. 33). The special motion alleged that commencement of the EBH Action violated NRS 41.660.\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   The GoldenTree Parties asserted that the commencement of the EBH Action violated the \"anti-SLAPP\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n   protections of the aforementioned Nevada statute.\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   On February 2, 2017, the State Court entered an order denying the GoldenTree Special Motion (\"EBH Special Order\"). (RJN-EBH Ex. 18). In that order, the State Court found that \"Defendants did not meet their burden on the Special Motion to Dismiss.\" EBH Special Order at 2:25-26.

The counterclaim and third-party complaint alleges substantially the same four causes of action asserted in the EBH Action, but also includes a fifth cause of action alleging that the GoldenTree Plaintiffs have intentionally interfered with EBH's contractual relations to other PIK Lenders.\n   <footnotemark>\n    30\n   </footnotemark>\n   There are thirty counter-defendants and third-party defendants named by EBH in its counterclaim and third-party complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   On March 17, 2017, the GoldenTree Plaintiffs, counterclaim defendants, and third party defendants, filed a special motion to dismiss the EBH Counterclaim under NRS 41.660 (\"Golden Tree EBH Special Motion\").

In that order, the State Court found that \"[T]he Moving Parties have not established, at this time, by a preponderance of the evidence that\n   <em>\n    the Claim\n   </em>\n   is based upon a good faith communication in furtherance of the right to petition or the right to free speech in direct connection with an issue of public concern.\" Golden Tree Special Order at 3:12-14 (emphasis added).

A threshold problem also may exist, however, with respect to the number of eligible claims required by Section 303(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   There allegedly are fifty-five participants in the PIK Loan. GLAS is the administrative agent on behalf of each lender, and apparently has authority to pursue any available collection remedy on behalf of all of the PIK Lenders.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   PIK Loan Agreement at \u00a7 2.4(e) and PIK Loan Annex at \u00a7 4.03. In the event of a maturity default under Section 4.01(b) of the PIK Loan Annex, GLAS allegedly has authority as administrative agent to pursue recovery of the entire PIK Loan in its own name.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   PIK Loan Annex at \u00a7 4.08. There are seven Petitioning Creditors, including GLAS,\n   <footnotemark>\n    46\n   </footnotemark>\n   and six of them are participants in the PIK Loan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Attachment \"A\" to the Petition consists of a table offered under penalty of perjury setting forth the alleged amount of each claim of the Petitioning Creditors. The table first lists the GLAS claim to be in the amount of \u20ac1,802,961,230.23. That figure is footnoted to explain, however, that it includes the claims of the six PIK Lender creditors that follow.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Petition, Attachment \"A\" at n.1. The aggregate amount of the claims of those other six Petitioning Creditors\n   <footnotemark>\n    47\n   </footnotemark>\n   is \u20ac773,186,974.39.\n   <footnotemark>\n    48\n   </footnotemark>\n   The table then concludes with a \"TOTAL AMOUNT\" figure of \u20ac1,802,961,230.23.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   It is not entirely clear to the court how the amount of the GLAS claim can be identical to the TOTAL AMOUNT figure for all of the claims appearing in the table. Perhaps that is an error in the construction of the table. What is more important, however, is that if the GLAS claim figure includes the claims of the other six Petitioning Creditors, a bona fide dispute as to the amount of any of those six claims would create a bona fide dispute as to the amount of the GLAS claim. Likewise, if the GLAS claim amount includes the claims of all fifty-five holders of interests in the PIK Loan, a bona fide dispute of any one of those fifty-five claims also\n   would create a bona fide dispute as to the alleged amount of the GLAS claim.\n   <footnotemark>\n    49\n   </footnotemark>\n   For Section 303(b)(1) to apply, the claims of at least three of the seven Petitioning Creditors must not be contingent as to liability or subject to bona fide dispute as to liability or amount.\n   <footnotemark>\n    50\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   But what if the seven Petitioning Creditors, including GLAS, assert that at least one of their claims is not contingent or subject to bona fide dispute as to liability or amount?\n   <footnotemark>\n    51\n   </footnotemark>\n   Under the language of Section 303(b)(2), a single petitioning creditor is sufficient, but only if the total number of such creditors is less than 12.\n   <footnotemark>\n    52\n   </footnotemark>\n   In this instance, neither the Petition nor Attachment \"A\" to that petition alleges that the EBH has fewer than 12 creditors holding qualifying claims. In fact, both GLAS and the PIK Lenders allege only that the petition satisfies the requirements of Section 303(b)(1).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   GLAS Opposition at 7:1-12; PIK Lender Opposition at 10:8-25. So even if GLAS has authority under the PIK Loan to pursue any available remedy on its own, including an involuntary bankruptcy proceeding against EBH, its claim would not be enough to satisfy Section 303(b)(2). The same would be true for any one of the other six Petitioning Creditors.\n   <footnotemark>\n    53\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Whether the Petitioning Creditors have met the pleading requirements to satisfy Section 303(b) is an issue separate and apart from the proof requirements under Section 303(h).

As previously indicated at note 51,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , GLAS also argues that its claim alone satisfies the requirements for an involuntary petition presumably because it allegedly exceeds $15,775. GLAS also maintains that it is not a party to the GoldenTree Action nor the EBH Action, and that the PIK Lenders it represents as agent in this involuntary proceeding also are not parties to those coordinated actions.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9:4-17.\n   <footnotemark>\n    61\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   FRBP 1011 provides that defenses and objections to an involuntary petition shall be presented in the manner prescribed by Civil Rule 12. Subparts (b), (c), (e) and (f) of Civil Rule 12 set forth the types of matters that may be presented by motion. Because EBH has not filed an answer to the Petition, the Dismissal Motion does not seek a judgment on the pleadings encompassed by Civil Rule 12(c). EBH also does not seek a more definite statement under Civil Rule 12(e), nor does it seek to strike any allegations of the Petition under Civil Rule 12(f). Because none of the other subparts apply, the Dismissal Motion presumably seeks relief under Civil Rule 12(b).

Dismissal under Civil Rule 12(b)(1) and Civil Rule 12(b)(3), therefore, would not be available. As there is no dispute the EBH is incorporated in Nevada, dismissal under Civil Rule 12(b)(2) for lack of personal jurisdiction is not available. As there is no dispute that an involuntary summons was properly issued by the bankruptcy court (ECF Nos. 55, 56) and was properly served on EBH (ECF No. 58), relief under Civil Rule 12(b)(4) and Civil Rule 12(b)(5) also is not available. As joint bankruptcy petitions can be filed only by individuals who are spouses,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20302\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 302\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), dismissal of the involuntary Petition for failure to join a party under Civil Rule 19 also is not available under Civil Rule 12(b)(7).\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hujazi v.

The latter rule specifies that when matters outside of the pleadings are considered by the court, a motion under Civil Rule 12(b)(6) must be treated as a motion for summary judgment governed by Civil Rule 56.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    In re Rothery\n   </em>\n   , 143 F.3d at 548-49 (Civil Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss involuntary Chapter 7 petition). Under that rule, summary judgment may be granted only \"if the movant shows that there is no\n   <em>\n    genuine dispute\n   </em>\n   as to any\n   <em>\n    material fact\n   </em>\n   and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" FED.R.CIV.P. 56(a) (emphasis added).\n   <footnotemark>\n    64\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   As previously mentioned, the Dismissal Motion is accompanied by thirty-two separate exhibits for which EBH requests that judicial notice be taken under FRE 201. Those exhibits consist of various pleadings, motions, responses, exhibits, orders, disclosures, and other documents filed in the GoldenTree Action and in the EBH Action. The opposition to the Dismissal Motion filed by the PIK Lender Group is accompanied by three separate documents consisting not only of exhibits filed in the State Court proceedings (RJN-PIK Ex. \"A\"),\n   <footnotemark>\n    65\n   </footnotemark>\n   but also copies of transcripts from certain hearings in those actions (RJN-PIK Ex. \"B\") as well as an entirely unrelated\n   involuntary Chapter 11 proceeding brought in this judicial district (RJN-PIK Ex. \"C\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    66\n   </footnotemark>\n   Added to this mix of materials outside of the Petition are two additional exhibits accompanying EBH's reply, for which judicial notice also is requested. Those additional exhibits consist of copies of the two anti-SLAPP motions that were filed in the GoldenTree Action and the EBH Action. It is against this impressive backdrop of thirty-seven documents outside of the Petition\n   <footnotemark>\n    67\n   </footnotemark>\n   that the court is requested to resolve the Dismissal Motion brought under Civil Rule 12(b)(6).\n   <footnotemark>\n    68\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Unfortunately, the arguments between the instant parties are ill-suited to resolution by a pleading motion. Either side may be completely wrong on the ultimate merits of the Petition, but both sides are, of course, certain. Neither side can establish the merits of their respective positions, however, without resorting to materials outside of the Petition. This is hardly surprising when parties to the same agreement have created a record of litigation in one court before commencing proceedings in another court. That litigation in state or federal court precedes the filing of an involuntary petition is not unusual. Even a creditor who prevails by default in a state court action can rely on the default judgment as establishing an eligible debt for purposes of its involuntary petition.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    In re Zapas\n   </em>\n   , 530 B.R. at 571-72 (state court default judgment remained in effect after involuntary Chapter 7 debtor's requests for relief from the judgment were denied on appeal). What is unusual in the present case is that six of the Petitioning Creditors who sued EBH on the PIK Loan prior to joining in the involuntary petition never obtained a judgment of any kind in their favor, and are the only parties who have appeals of the State Court's rulings now pending before the Nevada Supreme Court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    69\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   In this situation, Civil Rule 12(c) requires that the summary judgment standard under Civil Rule 56(a) be applied.

Moreover, because abstention under Section 305 may be sought in both voluntary and involuntary proceedings, the court is required to take into account the interests of all creditors,\n   <footnotemark>\n    74\n   </footnotemark>\n   not just the creditors that filed or joined in the involuntary petition.\n   <footnotemark>\n    75\n   </footnotemark>\n   EBH argues that the GoldenTree Action and the EBH Action\n   will fully resolve the liabilities between the parties under the PIK Loan, including any avoidance claims.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dismissal Motion at 36:11-18 &amp; nn.33 &amp; 34.\n   <footnotemark>\n    76\n   </footnotemark>\n   There is no dispute that those liabilities are governed entirely by state law rather than bankruptcy law. No one disputes that all of the factual and legal issues raised in connection with the PIK Loan can be resolved in the State Court. Consent to the entry of a final judgment is not an issue in the State Court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    77\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   In this instance, the named parties to this involuntary proceeding have stipulated to allow the State Court Litigation, including the appeals before the Nevada Supreme Court, to proceed during the involuntary \"gap period.\" The abstention requested by EBH essentially would extend the gap period through the conclusion of the State Court Litigation. There is no doubt that conclusion of that litigation will result in a final determination of the enforceability of the PIK Loan Agreement out of which most if not all of the claims in this bankruptcy proceeding, if any, would arise.\n   <footnotemark>\n    78\n   </footnotemark>\n   There also is no doubt that inconsistent outcomes could result if the State Court litigation on the enforceability of the\n   PIK Loan Agreement proceeds to judgment while this bankruptcy court makes the determinations required under Sections 303(b) and 303(h)(1) to involuntarily place EBH into bankruptcy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   The present status of the State Court Litigation tempers these considerations. The State Court orders denying the two anti-SLAPP dismissal motions are currently on appeal before the Nevada Supreme Court as required by NRS 41.679(4). If the Nevada Supreme Court concludes that the EBH Action should have been dismissed, along with the counterclaim and third party claims that EBH presented in the GoldenTree Action, then there likely would be no bona fide dispute as to liability or amount of the PIK Lender claims. Presumably these related appeals have been consolidated and briefing will be completed before the end of this year. Exactly when the Nevada Supreme Court will schedule oral argument, if at all, is unknown. At the hearing on the Dismissal Motion, none of the parties indicated whether they will seek to have the Nevada Supreme Court hear and decide the anti-SLAPP appeals before the scheduled trial of the coordinated actions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   The parties do not dispute that the State Court scheduled a jury trial on a five week \"stack\" to commence on April 16, 2018. (RJN-EBH Ex. 24). Not surprisingly, counsel for the respective parties differ on whether that jury trial actually will be ready to proceed on that date. EBH represented that significant discovery has been completed as evidenced by the over two million pages of documents already produced,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dismissal Motion at 2:7-8, but apparently concedes that EBH has produced a much smaller portion of those documents.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   EBH Reply at 2:19-21 &amp; n.9. Apparently, optimistic that the Nevada Supreme Court will rule in its favor on anti-SLAPP motions, EBH argues that the State Court Litigation will move forward on an expedited schedule.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dismissal Motion at 37:1-9; EBH Reply at 11:13-15. GLAS perhaps is optimistic that the dismissal rulings will be overturned, but separately maintains that the State Court Litigation is immaterial to GLAS's effort to seek involuntary relief against EBH.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   GLAS Opposition at 9:3 to 10:16. The PIK Lenders infer that the coordinated actions will not be ready for trial on the scheduled date.\n   <footnotemark>\n    79\n   </footnotemark>\n   Regardless of when the State Court Litigation is completed, however, further proceedings in the involuntary case at this time risk inconsistent outcomes on the merits of the claims arising from the PIK Loan Agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Debts that may be addressed through a voluntary bankruptcy are not required to be reduced to judgment, liquidated, noncontingent, matured, or undisputed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20101\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (12) and 101(5)(A).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   discussion at note 57,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   . A debtor can voluntarily seek relief from such debts by subjecting its real and personal property interests to the jurisdiction of the bankruptcy court. In such cases, the debtor does so consensually and also agrees to have its activities scrutinized by its creditors, any appointed trustee, and the court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   This is not the situation at all when parties attempt to take actual or constructive possession of a debtor's property without\n   its consent through an involuntary proceeding. Filing an involuntary petition against a debtor triggers the automatic stay that protects property of the bankruptcy estate, but the debtor, of course, is free to operate and use its property as if no involuntary proceeding had been commenced.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20303\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 303\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (f). If the involuntary debtor does not respond to the petition, an order for relief will be entered, thereby preventing the debtor from operating its business or using its property without supervision of the bankruptcy court or any appointed trustee. In a Chapter 7 context, entry of an order for relief results in the immediate appointment of a Chapter 7 bankruptcy trustee to take over control of the debtor's assets, including any business operations, any claims being prosecuted by the debtor, and any rights that may be asserted by the debtor. In a Chapter 11 context, entry of an order for relief does not automatically result in a trustee being appointed, but typically is followed by the petitioning creditors' immediate request for appointment of a Chapter 11 trustee under Section 1104(a).\n   <footnotemark>\n    80\n   </footnotemark>\n   A Chapter 11 trustee can exercise the same control over the debtor's assets that can be asserted by a Chapter 7 trustee.\n   <footnotemark>\n    81\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Where there is ongoing litigation, an involuntary bankruptcy offers obvious strategic advantages to a creditor. Not only can a bankruptcy trustee seek to avoid transfers made and obligations incurred by a debtor, she can also settle existing litigation and sell a debtor's claims and causes of action.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    In re Hyloft\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3760498\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/451/104/\">\n    451 B.R. 104\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Bankr. D. Nev. 2011). Moreover, a bankruptcy trustee might attempt to exercise any available statutory or contractual rights that the debtor possesses as an equity security holder in other, non-debtor entities.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Theodore Hartl, Trustee's Corporate Governance Rights and Obligations, at 2-3, ABA Business Law Section Spring Meeting, April 6-8, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Congress insisted, however, that a debtor who does not consent to bankruptcy court supervision cannot be deprived of its property unless \"[T]he debtor is generally not paying such debtor's debts as\n   <em>\n    such debts\n   </em>\n   become due unless\n   <em>\n    such debts\n   </em>\n   are the subject of a bona fide dispute as to liability or amount.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20303\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 303\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (h)(1). Bankruptcy law takes a cautionary approach when it permits the interests of creditors to be altered or abridged without their consent.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20363\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 363\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(2) (use of cash collateral);\n   <extracted-citation index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201129\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1129\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b) (Chapter 11 cramdown of dissenting holders of impaired claims and interests). No less is required when an alleged debtor is placed into bankruptcy without its consent.\n   <footnotemark>\n    82\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   In this case, the court concludes that a stay of this involuntary proceeding is appropriate. A stay of the proceeding is not a determination that a bona fide dispute as to liability or amount actually exists. Nor is it a determination that the Petition was filed in bad faith. Rather, it is a recognition that the GoldenTree Action and EBH Action are the appropriate and existing proceedings to resolve issues under nonbankruptcy law in a court that has undisputed authority to enter a final judgment. Entry of an order staying this involuntary bankruptcy proceeding pursuant to Section 305 therefore is warranted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   In light of the foregoing, the court will deny without prejudice the request for dismissal of this involuntary proceeding, and will stay the matter pending the outcome of the State Court Litigation until further order of this court.

So under the Bankruptcy Code, a claim or a debt can be a right to payment regardless of whether it is subject to dispute. This broad definition of debt is important to a debtor who voluntarily seeks bankruptcy relief because it maximizes the scope of the bankruptcy discharge. When a debtor is subjected to an involuntary petition, this broad definition also is important because it identifies the type of debt that will prevent a debtor from having its property taken under a bankruptcy court's jurisdiction without the debtor's consent. Thus, when it comes to involuntary bankruptcy cases, the existence of a dispute over the claims of the petitioning creditors raises a due process concern over the nonconsensual taking of a debtor's property.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"58\">\n   <p id=\"p-139\">\n    A bona fide dispute as to any amount of the petitioning creditor's claim also disqualifies the claim under Section 303(b).\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     In re\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Timothy Blixseth\n    </em>\n    , Case No. 11-15010-BAM, Order Granting Motion to Dismiss Involuntary Case, Docket No. 528, at 13:11 to 14:2 (Bankr.

Under FRBP 1018, however, references in the Civil Rules to a complaint are to be read as a reference to an involuntary bankruptcy petition. In an involuntary proceeding, a motion under Civil Rule 12(b)(6), therefore, asks whether the involuntary petition states a claim for which relief may be granted. At the hearing, counsel for EBH represented that the Dismissal Motion is not brought under Civil Rule 12(b)(6). Instead, counsel asserted that the Petitioning Creditors had failed to make a threshold, prima facie showing of noncontingent claims that are not subject to bona fide dispute under Section 303(b), apparently irrespective of whether there is proof at trial under Section 303(h)(1) that EBH generally is not paying its debts as they become due.

The summary judgment standard refers to \"genuine\" disputes of material\n    <em>\n     fact\n    </em>\n    that will preclude entry of judgment as a matter of law. It is not clear whether a \"bona fide\" dispute is the same as a \"genuine\" dispute. It seems clear, however, that when there is no genuine factual dispute between a petitioning creditor and an alleged debtor, there can still be a bona fide dispute over liability for the debt or the amount of the debt. Issues of statutory, common law, or contract interpretation fall into the latter category. If a petitioning creditor seeks summary judgment on its involuntary petition, but fails to demonstrate the absence of a genuine dispute of material fact that would require a judgment as a matter of law, is there necessarily a bona fide dispute as to liability or amount that disqualifies the petitioner's claim? If a petitioning creditor seeks summary judgment on its involuntary petition, but its claim depends on an unsettled question of state law, is there necessarily a bona fide dispute as to liability or amount that disqualifies the petitioner's claim? And what happens on summary judgment when parties to a contested involuntary petition give less than complete consent to the bankruptcy court's entry of a final judgment on all matters, including the underlying claims?\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    discussion at note 77,\n    <em>\n     infra\n    </em>\n    .

The commencement before the maturity date was predicated on an allegation that EBH was insolvent under Section 4.01(g) of the PIK Loan Annex, and the loan had accelerated without notice under Section 4.02 of the Annex. Apparently, after the GoldenTree Action was filed, the GoldenTree Plaintiffs made a written request to Credit Suisse to commence an action to enforce the loan as the predecessor administrative agent, but Credit Suisse did not do so. Because EBH disputes that it was or is insolvent, it maintains that acceleration had not occurred and that wrongful commencement of the GoldenTree Action resulted in a cancellation of its obligation under the PIK Loan Agreement. Those factual and legal contentions were alleged before the State Court in the EBH Counterclaim and in the EBH Complaint.

The term appears in Section 363(f)(4) as a basis for permitting property of a bankruptcy estate to be sold free and clear of an interest asserted by a non-debtor party. It also appears in the definition of \"insolvent\" under Section 101(32)(C)(i) with respect to a municipality. The 2005 amendments added the words \"as to liability or amount\" to the requirements for the eligible claims of involuntary petitioners, but made no changes to the only other instances in which the term bona fide dispute is used in the Code.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"71\">\n   <p id=\"p-153\">\n    Any summary judgment motion also should address whether the number of eligible claimants required by Section 303(b)(1) or Section 303(b)(2),\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    discussion at 719-21,\n    <em>\n     supra\n    </em>\n    , have joined in the involuntary Petition.

For discretionary abstention, the factors typically considered are: (1) economy and efficiency of case administration, (2) the availability of another forum to protect the interests of the parties or the pendency of another proceeding in state court, (3) the necessity for a federal proceeding to achieve a just and equitable solution, (4) the availability of alternative means to equitably distribute assets, (5) whether the debtor and creditors are able to achieve a less expensive arrangement out of court, (6) whether continuation of existing non-federal insolvency proceedings would be less costly and time-consuming, and (7) the purpose for seeking bankruptcy jurisdiction.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Dismissal Motion at 35:18 to 36:4,\n    <em>\n     citing\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Marciano v.

If the alleged debtor is adjudicated as bankrupt, then entry of an order for relief shifts the focus for the disposition of all creditor claims to the bankruptcy court. That result may be desirable to the Petitioning Creditors but equally undesirable to creditors who prefer a different venue to have their claims adjudicated. In this instance, the GoldenTree Plaintiffs chose to initiate litigation against EBH in State Court while other participants in the PIK Loan did not. When EBH responded by commencing its own action and asserting counterclaims and third party claims, the GoldenTree Parties chose to initiate anti-SLAPP proceedings. Having failed in their anti-SLAPP motions, the same GoldenTree Parties seek review by the Nevada Supreme Court. Now some of the same GoldenTree Plaintiffs seek entry of a bankruptcy order for relief on an involuntary basis that might wrest control from EBH's management of the defense of the GoldenTree Action as well as the prosecution of the EBH Action. Under these circumstances, the court must carefully consider the interests of the Petitioning Creditors, the non-petitioning creditors, and the alleged debtor.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"76\">\n   <p id=\"p-158\">\n    Whether a final judgment between the GoldenTree Parties and EBH would have issue res judicata effect as to other participants in the PIK Loan also is not before this court.
