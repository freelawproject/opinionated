No. 7)\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   by Plaintiffs National Truck Funding LLC (\"NTF\") and American Truck Group LLC (\"ATG\") (together, \"Debtors\"); and the Cross-Motion for Partial Summary Judgment (Adv. Dkt. No. 11) by Defendants Yolo Capital Inc., Hannah Baby LLC, First United Management Inc., and Moonpie FLP (collectively, \"Creditors\"). This proceeding is within the bankruptcy court's core jurisdiction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20157\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 157\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(2)(K) (\"determinations of the validity, extent, or priority of liens\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The ultimate issue before the Court is whether the Creditors have a valid, perfected security interest in cash proceeds-specifically, in monies that NTF receives as rental payments (\"Payments\") for the semi-trucks (\"Trucks\") it leases to individual independent operators under rental contracts (\"Rental Agreements\"). To fully resolve the dispute would require determining under Count One of the three-count Complaint whether the Creditors have valid, perfected security interests in the Trucks themselves. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 28-31, Adv. Dkt. No. 1 at 10.) At this juncture, however, and only for the purposes of the Motion and the Cross-Motion, the Court assumes that relief under Count One has been denied, meaning that the Creditors do have valid, perfected security interests in the Trucks. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Agreed Order, Case Dkt. No. 604 at 4.) Summary judgment is thus considered only for Counts Two and Three.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Assuming the Creditors' perfected security interests in the Trucks, the question under Count Two is whether the Creditors then perfected a security interest in the Rental Agreements as proceeds. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 32-35, Adv. Dkt. No. 1 at 10-11; Debtors' Br., Adv. Dkt. No. 7-1 at 3-4.) The question under Count Three is whether the Creditors have any basis besides the Rental Agreements on which to claim a security interest in the Payments. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 36-39, Adv. Dkt. No. 1 at 11-12; Debtors' Br., Adv. Dkt. No. 7-1 at 3-4.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Under Article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code, payments under a lease are proceeds of the original collateral. The Creditors thus have a basis besides the Rental Agreements on which to claim a\n   security interest in the Payments. The Motion is therefore denied without reaching the question of whether the Creditors perfected a security interest in the Rental Agreements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Yet to resolve, however, is whether the Payments are identifiable such that a security interest could be perfected. The Cross-Motion, which seeks an order that the Creditors have a valid and perfected security interest in the Payments, is therefore also denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    UNDISPUTED FACTS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The following facts were submitted by the Debtors and, except for the fifth fact, were adopted by the Creditors as undisputed and material:\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   1.

The Debtors argue that if the Payments are proceeds of the Trucks, paragraphs (a) and (c) collapse into \"cash proceeds\" in paragraph (b), because any proceeds \"can always, eventually, sooner or later, be cash.\" (Adv. Dkt. No. 7-1 at 23.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   But this argument is misplaced. This subsection means only that a perfected security interest automatically continues beyond twenty days in two kinds of proceeds: proceeds in which a security interest may be perfected by the same method as the security interest in the original collateral under paragraph (a); and\n   <strong>\n    identifiable\n   </strong>\n   cash proceeds under paragraph (b). In other words, it is not enough for the Payments to be cash proceeds; unless they are \"identifiable,\" the security interest in the Payments becomes unperfected on the twenty-first day after the security interest attaches unless either paragraph (a) or (c) applies. Thus, nothing about the operation\n   of paragraph (b) renders paragraphs (a) and (c) meaningless.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Commentary of the Permanent Editorial Board of the UCC\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   The Permanent Editorial Board of the UCC stated unequivocally more than twenty-five years ago that rental payments constitute proceeds of collateral consisting of goods.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   U.C.C. Text App. A, PEB Commentary No. 9 \u00a7 9-306(1) at 2-3 (June 25, 1992). Although PEB No. 9 was issued under a previous version of Article 9 that did not explicitly include \"lease\" as a disposition of collateral,\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   the PEB apparently did not consider the omission meaningful. Concurrent with the issuance of PEB No. 9, the Official Comments to the UCC were amended to add: \"Where a debtor has granted to a secured party a security interest in goods and the debtor later leases those goods as lessor, the lease rentals constitute proceeds of the secured party's collateral consisting of the goods.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Miss.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2075-9-315\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Miss.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2075-9-315\">\n    at 3\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   The Debtors, attempting to turn this statement to their advantage, argue that the hypotheticals discussed in PEB No. 9 are consistent with their view that the proceeds of the Trucks are the Rental Agreements. (Adv. Dkt. No. 14 at 14-15.) The Debtors ignore, however, that the PEB singled out two examples of actual cases it believed were wrongly decided.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   PEB No. 9 at 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   The fact pattern in the two cases the PEB rejected is in all material ways exactly like the fact pattern here. In the first case, the court ruled that a secured creditor that held a perfected first lien against a crane had a lien as to proceeds, but no security interest in the money the debtor received as rent when the debtor leased the crane without the creditor's consent.\n   <em>\n    Gen. Elec. Credit Corp. v. Cleary Bros. Constr. Co. (In re Cleary Bros. Constr. Co.)\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6522474\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/9/40/\">\n    9 B.R. 40\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Bankr. S.D. Fla. 1980). That court believed the UCC provided only one way to create a security interest in rent: \"The way to create a security interest in rent under the U.C.C. is to assign the lease or give a security interest in the lease. The rent would then be the proceeds of the collateral ....\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6522474\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/9/40/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6522474\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/9/40/\">\n    at 41\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Because there was no such assignment or security interest given in the lease, the rents were not proceeds.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6522474\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/9/40/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In the second case, the court ruled on facts \"almost identical\" to those in\n   <em>\n    Cleary Bros.\n   </em>\n   that \"proceeds do not include rental payments when the security interest does not cover the lease of the collateral.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v. Friend (In re A.E.I Corp.)\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6528972\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/11/97/#p101\">\n    11 B.R. 97\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 101 (Bankr. E.D. Pa. 1981). The PEB stated that these cases, \"to the extent that they hold that a subsequent lease of goods\n   <strong>\n    or payments thereon\n   </strong>\n   cannot constitute proceeds of a secured party's pre-existing collateral consisting of the goods,\" were \"not consistent\" with its analysis. PEB No. 9 at 2 (emphasis added). Yet this is precisely the ruling the Debtors urge here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   An Official Comment to the current Article 9 shows that PEB No. 9 informed the explicit inclusion of \"lease\" as a disposition of collateral in the revision: \"The revised definition of 'proceeds' expands the definition beyond that contained in the former Section 9-306\n   <strong>\n    and resolves ambiguities in the former section\n   </strong>\n   .\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Nev.%20Rev.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20104.9102\">\n    Nev.

Thus, under the analysis of PEB No. 9 as carried forward into the current Article 9, the Payments are proceeds of the Trucks.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   For the Creditors to ultimately prevail in this adversary proceeding, it is necessary but not sufficient that the Payments be proceeds of the Trucks. The Creditors must also have perfected security interests in the Payments. Assuming the Creditors' perfected security interests in the Trucks, that perfection continued automatically in the Payments: \"A security interest in proceeds is a perfected security interest if the security interest in the original collateral was perfected.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Nev.%20Rev.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20104.9315\">\n    Nev.
