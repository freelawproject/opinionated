The Credit Union first argues that the Debtors did not satisfy the means test prescribed by Section 707(b)(2), contending that they may not treat Credit Union's judgment debt as a secured debt and challenging certain deductions made in their calculations. It further argues that the totality of the circumstances reveals the Debtors' financial situation to be well above the median income of those similarly situated, amounting to abuse under Section 707(b)(3). For the reasons discussed below, the court finds that neither the means test nor the totality of the circumstances gives rise to a presumption of abuse in this case. Accordingly, the Motion will be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    JURISDICTION AND PROCEDURE\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The court has jurisdiction to decide this matter pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201334\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1334\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and Internal Operating Procedure 15(a) of the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois.

Plichta and Donna M. Plichta commenced this Chapter 7 case on September 23, 2017. This is their third bankruptcy; the couple's last case, filed under Chapter 7 in late 2009, was dismissed on October 4, 2010.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Following the meeting of creditors held on November 11, 2017, the Chapter 7 Trustee reported his determination as to the existence of assets or likelihood assets may reasonably be recovered for administration. (ECF. No. 15.) The Trustee and the Debtors later reached a settlement whereby the estate would not pursue the Debtors for the alleged non-exempt value of certain household goods, furnishings and personal property in return for which the Plichtas would turn over $23,028 representing the proceeds from the sale of stock for which the Debtors claimed an exemption. This court approved the proposed compromise and on June 1, 2018, the Trustee filed his final account and certification that the estate has been fully administered.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   (ECF No. 70.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Credit Union filed the Motion on November 22, 2017, less than three weeks after the initial meeting of creditors.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Bankr. P. 1017(e)(1). The court held a one-day trial on the Motion at which only Debtor Donna Plichta was called to testify. Copies of the Debtors' petition and schedules filed in this case and a group exhibit consisting of photographs of the Plichtas' residence were the only exhibits offered at trial. The parties also filed a joint statement of stipulated facts on April 25, 2018. (ECF No. 58.) The court also takes judicial notice of the court's docket in the case and filings therein.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Lulay Law Offices v.

Ill. 2017) (taking \"judicial notice of matters of public record, such as filings in the bankruptcy court, even where not specifically referenced by the parties\") (citing\n   <em>\n    United States v.

The Plichtas reside in Barrington Hills, Illinois, at 750 Plum Tree Road. The individual Debtors acknowledge \"that their obligations are primarily consumer debts.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20707\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 707\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1). Credit Union holds the Debtors' Note in the amount of $210,000, dated January 18, 2008, which is secured by their mortgage on the Barrington Hills property. The Note provides that the Debtors will repay Credit Union in monthly installments of $490.37, beginning January 2009. However, in March 2013 the Debtors defaulted on the note. They never cured the default and have not made a payment on the Note since then. On November 10, 2016, the\n   Circuit Court for the 22\n   <sup>\n    nd\n   </sup>\n   Judicial Circuit (McHenry County, Illinois) granted the Credit Union summary judgment on the note, awarding it $240,893.02, plus costs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The Debtors are represented by counsel in this bankruptcy case. It is not disputed that the Plichtas caused the requisite certificates, statements, forms and schedules to be filed with their Chapter 7 petition on September 13, 2017. With these documents the Debtors filed their declaration, signed by both under penalty of perjury, that affirms that they had reviewed their schedules and \"that they are true and correct.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The Debtors' bankruptcy schedules disclose total debt secured by property of $1,589,989 and total non-priority unsecured indebtedness of $29,719. Their Schedule D further indicates that based on the value of collateral the unsecured portion of their otherwise secured debt is $989,989. The Debtors' residence is collateral for the secured debt. Shellpoint Mortgage Servicing holds the first mortgage on the property for $1,349,096. The Credit Union holds the second mortgage for $240,893. The parties do not dispute the Debtors' valuation of $600,000 for the Barrington Hills residence\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   nor the lack of equity in the property. In their filings the Debtors stated their intention to keep the Barrington Hills property. They intend to stay current on their mortgage payments to the senior secured lender, but do not intend on making further installment payments on the note held by the Credit Union. (Form 108 Statement of Intention, ECF No. 1.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The Debtors' Form 122A-1 Statement of Current Monthly Income lists their total monthly income to be $10,416.00. Mr. Plichta's gross wages, salary, tips, bonuses, overtime, and commissions is identified to be the primary source of their income. (ECF No. 7.) It discloses that their household consists of three people and that their annual income, $124,992.00, exceeds the median family income for a family of three in Illinois ($76,406.00). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The accompanying Form 122A-2 Means Test Calculation claims deductions based on IRS standards of $1,378.00 for food, clothing and other items, $147.00 for out-of-pocket health care allowances, $572.00 for housing / utilities / insurance / operating expenses and $682.00 for vehicle operation expenses. (ECF No. 8.) Their Statement also lists mortgage or rent expense of $1,906.00 which they did not factor into the means test analysis which claimed instead estimated average monthly payments which they calculated for the secured indebtedness to Shellpoint Mortgage Servicing ($3,472.00) and Consumers Credit Union ($4,015.00). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) They also claimed deductions of $2,600.00 for taxes, $1,153.00 for additional health care expenses, $90.00 for optional telephone services, $312.00 for health insurance and $30.00 for charitable contributions. From these figures the Debtors derived their monthly disposable income to be negative $4,035.00 for purposes of the means test, which figure is based on $10,416.00 current monthly income and $14,451.00 in total deductions. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The Debtors now admit that this calculation is incorrect because they erroneously used the IRS Local Standards for Lake County, Illinois, rather than McHenry County. (Stipulation, ECF No. 58.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The Debtors' Schedule I lists Mr. Plichta's monthly income to be $10,416.00 subject to payroll deductions totaling $3,562.00. Adding to this Ms. Plichta's Social\n   Security income of $1,034, the schedule estimates their total monthly income to be $7,888.00. Their Schedule J estimates total monthly household expenses of $9,152.44, which amount includes $3,472.44 for home ownership expenses, $200.00 for home maintenance, repair and upkeep, $800 for utilities and $600 attributed to their service dogs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Ms. Plichta testified at trial. Her testimony began with a review of Schedules I and J which confirmed her spouse's income. She testified that she does not know how much they have in retirement savings. Turning to schedule J, she testified that their 32-year-old daughter \"lost her job\" and has lived with her parents since shortly before this case commenced, around August 30 - September 1, 2017. The witness explained that her daughter suffers from a worsening debilitating medical condition, \"very serious health issues\" as Ms. Plichta put it. Remaining unemployed, the daughter does not \"contribute anything\" to support the household and depends on her parents for her support. Ms. Plichta further testified that due to her own medical condition she has two certified service dogs as prescribed by her doctor. Her testimony that that the $600 expense for the service animals in the schedules accurately reflects their expense was not controverted. She further testified that both animals have assisted her for more than ten years.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Ms. Plichta then proceeded to summarize the Debtors' financial circumstances. She and her husband purchased their residence in 2003, describing the purchase as the couple's last major voluntary expense or luxury item. She testified that since then they have spent approximately $60,000 on needed modifications and improvements to the house. Ms. Plichta further testified that she suffers from an autoimmune disorder and that over the years her condition has necessitated the customization of their house, including the installation of a \"specified humidification system\" to assist her breathing. She described the couple's car as \"old\" and testified that they took their last vacation more than fifteen years ago. Ms. Plichta testified that the last major household items they purchased were a couch in 2003 and a television in 2004.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Ms. Plichta testified that in June 2017 they discovered mold in their house. She stated that they have spent approximately $40,000 to date for the removal and remediation of the mold. The remediation work continues. Ms. Plichta also testified that a tumor on her spine was discovered in the Spring of 2017 and that in early 2018 her husband was diagnosed with a coronary blockage. She expects the Debtors expenses will increase as a result of these circumstances.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     DISCUSSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Section 707(b) of the Bankruptcy Code authorizes the dismissal or conversion of Chapter 7 cases brought by individual consumer debtors if the court determines that granting the discharge would constitute \"abuse.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20707\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 707\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1).

When the presumption under the means test does not arise or is rebutted, the court shall consider whether the petition was filed in bad faith or the totality of the circumstances of the debtor's financial circumstances demonstrate abuse.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20707\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 707\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(3).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   6 COLLIER ON BANKRUPTCY \u00b6 707.04[4][b].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Section 707(b)(6) limits the standing of parties who may file a motion under Section 707(b) where the debtors' combined current monthly income is less than the applicable median family income. In the present case neither party contends that the Debtors are \"below median.\" This threshold amount, $76,406, is the median income for a family of three in Illinois as of the petition date. Census Bureau Median Family Income By Family Size (Cases Filed Between May 1, 2017 and October 31, 2017, Inclusive), https://www.justice.gov/ust/eo/bapcpa/20170501/bci_data/median_income_table.htm (last visited Sept. 4, 2018). No evidence has been presented by either party to suggest the Debtors are \"below median.\" Rather, the Official Form 122A-1 filed by the Debtors on September 13, 2017 lists their total current monthly income to be $10,416 or $124,992 annually, well above the threshold.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Whether the Presumption Arises Under the Means Test.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The Credit Union first argues that the abuse may be presumed here by operation of the means test. Under Section 707(b)(2), abuse shall be presumed if the debtor's \"current monthly income\" minus allowable expenses times 60 is greater or equal to $12,850 or is greater or equal to the greater of $7,475 or 25% of the debtor's nonpriority unsecured claims.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20707\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 707\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(2)(A)(i). The Bankruptcy Code provides that current monthly income\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   (A) means the average monthly income from all sources that the debtor receives (or in a joint case the debtor and the debtor's spouse receive) without regard to whether such income is taxable income, derived during the 6-month period ending on-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   (i) the last day of the calendar month immediately preceding the date of the commencement of the case if the debtor files the schedule of current income required by section 521(a)(1)(B)(ii); or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   (ii) the date on which current income is determined by the court for purposes of this title if the debtor does not file the schedule of current income required by section 521(a)(1)(B)(ii); and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   (B) includes any amount paid by any entity other than the debtor (or in a joint case the debtor and the debtor's spouse), on a regular basis for the household expenses of the debtor or the debtor's dependents (and in a joint case the debtor's\n   spouse if not otherwise a dependent), but excludes benefits received under the Social Security Act, payments to victims of war crimes or crimes against humanity on account of their status as victims of such crimes, and payments to victims of international terrorism (as defined in section 2331 of title 18) or domestic terrorism (as defined in section 2331 of title 18) on account of their status as victims of such terrorism.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20101\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (10A).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The Debtors scheduled their current monthly income as $10,416, consisting of Mr. Plichta's gross wages, salary and commission as an architect and excluding the $1,034 Ms. Plichta receives each month in Social Security payments. The Credit Union does not dispute the current monthly income estimated by the Debtors. Instead, it challenges the Debtors' deductions from this income.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Section 707(b)(2)(A)(i) permits debtors to deduct certain specified items from their current monthly income.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20707\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 707\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(2)(A)(ii), (iii) and (iv). Applicable amounts based primarily on Internal Revenue Service standard expenses for the area in which the debtor resides are deducted under Subpart (A)(ii). Subpart (A)(iii) permits deductions for payments on account of secured debts and (A)(iv) permits deductions for payments of priority claims. In their Form 122A-2 Means Test Calculation filed September 13, 2017, the Debtors claim a total of $6,622 in \"expenses allowed under IRS expense allowances,\" $342 in \"additional expense deductions\" and $7,487 for payments on \"debts that are secured by an interest in property that [the Debtors own].\" (ECF No. 8.) Based on these figures, the Debtors calculate that their monthly disposable income for purposes of Section 707(b)(2)'s means test is a negative amount, -$4,035, and therefore argue that the presumption of abuse does not arise in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The Credit Union disagrees. It objects to the Debtors' deduction for payments on their secured debts, particularly the debt owed the Credit Union, arguing that such payments should be disallowed because the Debtors are not making payments on them and show no sign they will do so in the future. In addition, it points out that the Debtors did not use the standard IRS allowance for McHenry County, Illinois, where they reside, and instead used the allowance for a more expensive county. The Credit Union further asserts that the Debtors used otherwise incorrect amounts that inflated their deductions. It argues that when these amounts are corrected to reflect allowed expenses, the Debtors fail to \"pass\" the statutory means test.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Debtors Need Not Retain Collateral or Intend to Make Actual Payments to Deduct Contractually Scheduled Payments on Secured Debts for Purposes of Section 707(b)(2)(A)(iii).\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The Debtors valued their residence to be worth $600,000 and the parties stipulate that it is encumbered by a first mortgage of Shellpoint Mortgage Servicing with a balance due of $1,349,096.00 and the second mortgage of Consumers Credit Union with $240,893.00 still outstanding. (Stipulation, ECF No. 58, \u00b610.) In their Form 122A-2 Means Test Calculation, the Debtors' list total average monthly payments of $3,472.00 to Shellpoint Mortgage Servicing and $4,015.00 to Consumers Credit Union. Their Schedule J lists $3,472.44 as the amount of their monthly \"rental or home ownership expense [including] first mortgage payments.\" (ECF No. 1.) The Debtors admit that \"they have no intention to make [payments to Consumer Credit Union] going forward\" and\n   instead intend for the Credit Union to \"[e]ssentially ... be treated as another unsecured creditor.\" (Debtors' Resp., ECF No. 28, \u00b619.) There is no dispute that the monthly installment payment on the mortgage note to Consumer Credit Union was $490.37, and that the Credit Union obtained a judgment in the amount of $240,893.02 after the Debtors March 2013 default.

The Debtors assert that because the Credit Union judgment was entered prepetition they may treat the entire amount as contractually due and divide that sum, $240,893.02, by 60 months to reach the $4,015 monthly figure entered on the means test form.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   For the means test calculation, Section 707(b)(2) permits the reduction of:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   [t]he debtor's average monthly payments on account of secured debts [which] shall be calculated as the sum of-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   (I) the total of all amounts scheduled as contractually due to secured creditors in each month of the 60 months following the date of the filing of the petition; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   (II) any additional payments to secured creditors necessary for the debtor, in filing a plan under chapter 13 of this title, to maintain possession of the debtor's primary residence, motor vehicle, or other property necessary for the support of the debtor and the debtor's dependents, that serves as collateral for secured debts;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   divided by 60.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20707\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 707\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(2)(A)(iii).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The Credit Union urges us to adopt the view of certain courts that a debtor may not deduct under Section 707(b)(2)(A)(iii) payments on a secured loan where the debtor has expressed an intent to surrender the collateral.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    In re Fredman,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5731804\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/471/540/\">\n    471 B.R. 540\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Bankr.

Although Section 707(b)(2)(A)(iii) refers to \"average monthly payments,\" the statute is clear that the permitted reduction is not based on actual anticipated payments. To the contrary, it states that the amount \"shall be calculated\" using the formula it provides. This formula is not based on anticipated actual payments, but rather on amounts \"scheduled as contractually due.\" Indeed, where the final payment is due less than 60 months after the petition date or where the contract provides for unequal payments, the formula modifies the amount deductible even from the scheduled amount by re-amortizing all amounts due within that 5-year period across 60 months.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   The court in\n   <em>\n    In re Fredman\n   </em>\n   found the term \"scheduled as contractually due\" used in Section 707(b)(2)(A)(iii) to be a \"term of art in bankruptcy parlance that refers to a debtor placing information on the bankruptcy schedules.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5731804\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/471/540/\">\n    471 B.R. at 550\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

It notes that the original payment schedule on its loan was for monthly payments of only $490.37 and argues that the original contract merged into and was extinguished by the judgment the Credit Union obtained prepetition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   However, this court finds the statute refers more broadly to any amount which became contractually due in or before and remains \"due in\" any of the months within the 60-month period. This interpretation better accords with the plain meaning of the words of the statute. Where Congress refers narrowly to only amounts which come due within an original payment schedule elsewhere in the Bankruptcy Code, it uses the term \"original payment schedule.\" For example, Section 1322(c)(2) permits modification of a secured claim on a principal residence if \"the last payment on the original payment schedule ... is due before the date on which the final payment under the plan is due.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201322\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1322\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(2). Similarly, where the Bankruptcy Code refers to a payment\n   <em>\n    becoming\n   </em>\n   due rather than remaining due, it states as much. For example, in Section 1325(a)(8), the Bankruptcy Code requires for confirmation of a Chapter 13 plan that the debtor have paid all domestic support obligations \"that first become payable after the date of the filing of the petition.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201325\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1325\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(8).

Section 1325(b)(2) defines \"disposable income\" as the debtor's \"current monthly income received by the debtor\" minus certain deductions and allowed expenses set forth in Section 1325(b). A debtor's \"current monthly income\" is defined using a mechanical and backwards-looking approach\n   based on the \"average monthly income from all sources that the debtor receives ... without regard to whether such income is taxable income, derived during the 6-month period ending on ... the last day of the calendar month immediately preceding the\" petition date.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20101\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (10A).

Section 707(b)(2)(A)(iii) is\n   clear that the deduction for \"payments on account of secured debts\" shall be calculated based on required \"payments to secured creditors.\" The evidence and stipulations show that while the Credit Union is not a \"secured creditor\" for purposes of Section 707(b)(2)(A)(iii), Shellpoint is. The parties have stipulated that the Credit Union's mortgage is a \"second\" mortgage and that the Shellpoint holds a \"first mortgage\" in the residence securing a debt of over $1.3 million. While neither party contends that the Debtors' residence is worth more than $600,000, neither contend that the property is worthless. It cannot be disputed that after application of Section 506(a), the Credit Union's debt must be treated as a completely unsecured claim and that at least part of the claim of Shellpoint Mortgage Servicing remains secured. Because the calculation under Section 707(b)(2)(A)(iii) is based not on the total value of the debt, but on scheduled or required payments \"to secured creditors,\" this court must conclude (first) that none of the Debtors' contractually scheduled payments to the Credit Union can be deducted and (second) that the Debtors' scheduled payments within the relevant timeframe to Shellpoint may be deducted under the means test, even if a portion of that debt is determined to be unsecured under Section 506(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   This accords with the reasoning of\n   <em>\n    Nobelman v.

It is especially clear here, where it appears that Shellpoint's mortgage is solely in property that is the debtor's principal residence, and therefore would be protected by Section 1322(b)(2) in a Chapter 13 proceeding. Because Section 707(b)(2)(A)(iii)(II) permits deduction of \"additional payments to secured creditors necessary for the debtor, in filing a plan under chapter 13 of this title, to maintain possession of the debtor's primary residence\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   and because\n   <em>\n    Nobelman\n   </em>\n   holds that Shellpoint's contract rights cannot be modified by a plan, the Debtors would presumably have to continue to make contractual payments to Shellpoint to maintain possession of their residence. The same is not true of the completely undersecured Consumers Credit Union.\n   <em>\n    See supra,\n   </em>\n   n. 6;\n   <em>\n    Palomar v. First Am. Bank\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4062776,4200447\" index=\"114\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/722/992/\">\n    722 F.3d 992\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 995 (7th Cir. 2013).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Therefore, the Debtors' Form 122A-2 Means Test analysis incorrectly deducts \"average monthly payments\" to the Credit Union of $4,015.00. When that error is corrected, the Debtors' monthly disposable income under the means test totals a negative $20 per month, slightly below the threshold for presumptive abuse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Adjustment for the IRS Standard Expense Allowance.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Of the $6,622.00 in expenses \"allowed under the IRS expense allowances\" that the Debtors used in their means test calculation, three deductions were based on local, rather than national, standards. However, the Debtors have admitted that they used figures for Lake County rather than McHenry County, where their residence is located, in claiming these deductions. (Resp., ECF No. 28, \u00b6 20.) In doing so they incorrectly claimed a deduction of $682 for their vehicle operation expenses for their two vehicles rather than the permitted $406, and claimed $572 for non-mortgage housing and utility expenses rather than the permitted $520.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   If the Debtors had used the correct numbers based on McHenry County, they would have had a total of $328 less in monthly allowances. Together with the adjustment removing the Credit Union payments, this would result in positive monthly disposable income under the means test of $308 per month. Multiplied by 60, this amounts to $18,480, $5,630 above the $12,850 maximum established by Section 707(b)(2),\n   thereby triggering the presumption of abuse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   <strong>\n    B. The Debtors Have Rebutted the Presumption.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Section 707(b)(2) further provides that \"the presumption of abuse may only be rebutted by demonstrating special circumstances, such as a serious medical condition or a call or order to active duty in the Armed Forces, to the extent such special circumstances that justify additional expenses or adjustments of current monthly income for which there is no reasonable alternative.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"115\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20707\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 707\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(2)(B)(i).

The movant did not challenge her testimony about her health and largely did not dispute her special needs. Ms. Plichta testified credibly about these needs, including the necessity for two certified service dogs. This court observed firsthand at trial the Debtor's dependence on the animal that accompanied her to the courtroom and the extent it calmed her and enabled her to testify. She testified that her smaller dog is an emotional support animal while the larger is a \"duty dog\" that retrieves objects she cannot pick up and helps her if she falls. The Debtors' Schedule J listed the monthly expense for the service dogs to be $300 each. Ms. Plichta testified credibly to the accuracy of this estimate, clarifying that the amount sometimes varied depending on whether they had a hospital visit during a given month. The Credit Union elicited no testimony and provided no evidence to suggest that such listed expenses were not accurate or to controvert the evidence that the dogs were necessary for Ms. Plichta's medical condition. Nor does the Credit Union dispute the monthly income listed in the Debtors' means test calculation or controvert their testimony that the other ordinary expenses included in their deductions are reasonable and necessary.\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   The service dog expense was not included in the medical and insurance expenses used in the means test calculation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   When the means test is performed with the $600 incurred monthly for Ms. Plichta's service animals, the Debtors available income falls well below the threshold for the statutory presumption.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   This is so even if, as the Credit Union urges, the Debtors' expenses should be limited to the standard amount for a household of two. In their means test calculation, the Debtors included their adult daughter, but they did not claim her as a dependent in their 2017 federal tax returns. Ms. Plichta testified without contravention\n   that their adult daughter moved in with them shortly before the petition date and that the daughter depends entirely on her parents for support. She explained that she and her spouse did not and could not claim their daughter as a dependent in their 2017 federal tax returns because she had lived with them less than the requisite six months for tax year 2017. Ms. Plichta testified credibly that their daughter has serious health issues, lost her job and on August 30 or September 1, 2017, and moved back in with the Debtors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Courts have disagreed on the appropriate method for determining the number of people within a family or household for purposes of Section 707(b)(2).

The mistaken use of the Lake County standard for the means test was readily acknowledged by the Debtors. The Credit Union does not contend that the Debtors have additional income or that they will not actually incur the expenses listed in their Schedule J.\n   <footnotemark>\n    26\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   Nor has the Credit Union contended that any of the expenses claimed by the Debtors - other than the mortgage payment and certain other payments related to their home - are unnecessary or should be considered luxury expenditures. It contends instead that it is unreasonable for the Debtors to \"choos[e] to stay living in [a] home that costs $800 per month for electricity and heating, $200.00 per month for repairs, and a mortgage of over $1.5 million for a property only worth $600,000.00 rather than repay their creditors.\" (ECF No. 30.) In addition, the Credit Union argues that it was abuse for the \"Debtors [to spend] $40,000.00 in three months in 2017 for mortgage payments (to Shellpoint Mortgage), home repairs, and mold remediation\" pre-petition instead of making any payments to it. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   But the Credit Union fails to meet its burden of demonstrating that the Debtors' prepetition conduct or the petition itself constitute abuse warranting dismissal. Ms. Plichta testified credibly about the condition and furnishings of their home and the repairs performed, and supplemented this testimony with photographs showing the condition of the home. The movant does not challenge her testimony that the last significant purchases for their home are a couch purchased in 2003 and a 2004 television set. Nor did it controvert her testimony that the remediation of the mold damage and expenditures for the humidification system addressing her breathing difficulties were necessary for the Debtors' health and to maintain the integrity of the home. Nor do the photographs of the home presented at trial suggest that the Debtors had made luxury improvements to their home.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   The Motion points to the current balances of the mortgages and the current value of the home to argue that \"the Debtors incurred consumer debts far in excess of their ability to pay.\" (ECF No. 18, \u00b6 29.) But the Credit Union provided no evidence as to the original value of the home, the Debtors' financial condition at the time the loans were incurred or the payment history of the mortgage debts to show that it was unreasonable at the time for the Debtors to incur the debts. As noted above, the mortgage loans are not recent, and the Credit Union provided no evidence to show they were incurred in anticipation of bankruptcy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   The Credit Union seems to argue that it would not be a \"hardship,\" as the court phrased it in\n   <em>\n    In re Schwartz\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    ,\n   </em>\n   for the Debtors to find less expensive housing, particularly if their current home is worth significantly less than the debt encumbering it. The Credit Union failed to offer any proof that less expensive suitable alternate housing is available. The court cannot speculate on what alternatives are available to these Debtors, particularly given their testimony\n   regarding their medical conditions. Ms. Plichta testified as to numerous severe medical conditions afflicting her and the other members of her family. She also testified without contravention that the Debtors had spent approximately $20,000 in 2003 to install specialized ductwork in their home because of one of her health conditions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   Additionally, the court is cautious about dismissing a case under Section 707(b)(3) solely because a debtor has a high amount of secured debt. The court in\n   <em>\n    Deutscher\n   </em>\n   noted that courts should be \"attentive to the policy choices made by Congress in drafting the means test, including the fact that it gave preferred treatment to secured creditors by allowing scheduled payments of secured debt to be listed as deductions without limitation.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4130243\" index=\"151\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/419/42/#p45\">\n    419 B.R. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   45 (citing\n   <em>\n    In re Le Roy,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"152\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2009%20WL%20357923\">\n    2009 WL 357923\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3 (Bankr. E.D. Wis. Feb. 12, 2009). As noted above, there is no indication that the debts here were incurred in contemplation of bankruptcy or to manipulate the means test. Nor has the Credit Union shown the Debtors' residence to constitute a \"luxury\" or unnecessary expenditure such that it would not constitute a hardship for the Debtors to lose their home.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   Finally, the Credit Union has not shown that creditors would receive more in a Chapter 13 or Chapter 11 bankruptcy. The final report of the Chapter 7 Trustee states that the bankruptcy estate has recovered $23,028, largely from his settlement with the Debtors. (ECF No. 54.) The Trustee stated at a hearing on the Motion that he opposes dismissal or conversion of the Debtors' case, which, in his opinion, would likely result in a return of some or all of that money to the Debtors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   This court tends to agree. To the extent the means test calculation approximates the projected disposable income that would be available to creditors in a Chapter 13 or Chapter 11 reorganization, the Debtors' calculation shows less than $22,000 available even after the corrections and adjustments discussed above. The Credit Union has not shown the likelihood that the Debtors, a couple of advanced years whose income is largely limited to retirement funds and the \"social safety net,\" in coming years will have available disposable income sufficient to pay creditors more through a Chapter 13 or 11 plan than they would receive through liquidation. Indeed, the Credit Union is likely better off through a Chapter 7 liquidation since it at least would retain its junior mortgage.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bank of America v.
