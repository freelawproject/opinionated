(ECF Nos. 25 and 26).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On September 20, 2011, the court entered an order granting Leeds her Chapter 7 discharge. (ECF No. 30). As a result of her discharge, the automatic stay terminated as to Leeds under Section 362(c)(2)(C), but remained in effect as to the Leeds Residence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On February 29, 2012, an order was entered approving the settlement of a preference action that had been commenced by the Kim Firm on behalf of the bankruptcy estate.

On May 8, 2013, however, SFR purchased the Leeds Residence at a foreclosure sale conducted on behalf of the Butler HOA. Under Nevada law, certain portions of HOA assessment liens have priority over residential mortgages.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   NRS 116.3116(2)(b). When the homeowner does not satisfy the priority lien, the HOA can foreclose on the residence. The Nevada Supreme Court has concluded that a valid HOA foreclosure sale of residential property extinguishes the lower priority mortgage held by the residential lender.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    SFR Inv. Pool 1, LLC v.

As there was no abandonment of the Leeds Residence under Section 554(a or b) prior to case closure, the Leeds Residence was still property of the bankruptcy estate being administered by Rosenberg at the time SFR purchased the Leeds Residence at the Butler HOA foreclosure sale.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   In the instant case, the Reopening Order obtained under Section 350 did not reimpose the automatic stay nor did it revest the Leeds Residence or any other property in the prior Chapter 7 estate. Additionally, there was no injunction entered by this court precluding further action in the A &amp; K v. Leeds Action. As a result, the State Court order granting summary judgment in favor of BOA did not violate the automatic stay nor any order issued by a federal court. Likewise, that summary judgment order did not violate the discharge injunction protecting Leeds because it was not a determination of the personal liability of Leeds with respect to an obligation that was discharged in her bankruptcy. In short, nothing about the State Court summary judgment order in favor of BOA violated the automatic stay, an order of this court, or the discharge injunction.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gruntz v.

While the bankruptcy court has authority to consider the instant Annulment Motion, it has no authority to set aside or otherwise review the State Court summary judgment order.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   In the instant case, the automatic stay was violated both by the HOA in seeking to enforce its assessment lien against the Leeds Residence, and by SFR in seeking to obtain possession and control over the Leeds Residence. Both the HOA and SFR are \"entities\" that were subject to the automatic stay and the Leeds Residence was property of the estate. Under settled automatic stay jurisprudence, both the act of the HOA and the act of SFR are\n   <em>\n    void ab initio\n   </em>\n   . Only SFR, however, has sought to annul the automatic stay. But if the automatic stay is annulled to permit the foreclosure sale to proceed retroactively, separate relief in favor of Butler HOA should not be necessary. SFR argues that annulment of the automatic stay is appropriate under the \"Fjeldsted Factors.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Annulment Motion at 5:12 to 6:4; SFR Reply at 12:11 to 15:13.

Bailey attests that SFR was formed by Rosenberg and his wife, Barbara Rosenberg.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Bailey Affidavit at \u00b6\u00b6 5 and 6. He attests that Hardin was not the sole manager of SFR, but that Bailey reported to Rosenberg, to his wife, and to Kim.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   In response to BOA's serious allegations,\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   SFR submitted only the Supplemental Hardin Declaration.

He further attests that as the sole manager of SFR, he had sole decision making authority on the purchase of properties at the HOA auctions, that he did not discuss or consult with his attorneys the properties to be purchased, and that he had no knowledge of the Leeds bankruptcy at the time of the purchase.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 8, 9 and 12. Although SFR's response does not directly contradict any of the evidence presented by BOA,\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   factual disputes ordinarily would require an evidentiary hearing before a disposition of the Annulment Motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   At the hearing on the Annulment Motion, however, counsel for SFR acknowledged on the record that Rosenberg did act as counsel for SFR when Rosenberg was still the Chapter 7 trustee in the Leeds case. He also confirmed that Rosenberg was counsel for SFR at the time the Leeds Residence was purchased by SFR at the HOA foreclosure sale. Counsel for SFR was unaware of whether Rosenberg received compensation for his services to SFR, but acknowledged that SFR receives rent for the former Leeds Residence as part of SFR's business operations. Apparently in support of one of the Fjelsted Factors, counsel for SFR argued that Rosenberg's knowledge of the Leeds bankruptcy proceeding should not be imputed to SFR.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   A bankruptcy trustee has a fiduciary duty to all creditors of the bankruptcy estate.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    generally\n   </em>\n   3 COLLIER ON BANKRUPTCY , \u00b6 323.02[2] and 6 COLLIER ON BANKRUPTCY , \u00b6 704.04[1] (Richard Levin and Henry J.

The Butler HOA foreclosure was completed on May 8, 2013. The Interpleader Action was commenced on September 10, 2013. On April 17, 2014, an \"Affidavit of Due Diligence re: Myong Leeds, an Individual,\" was filed in the Interpleader Action.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Exhibit 16 to Removal Notice. That affidavit attests that a licensed process server was unable to locate Leeds at various addresses in Las Vegas, Nevada, as well as in Illinois.\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n   According to the COS accompanying the instant Annulment Motion, notice of SFR's request was given electronically to Ballstaedt, Rosenberg, the Office of the United States Trustee (\"UST\"), and counsel for two secured creditors. The Annulment Motion also was served by United States mail on an unsecured creditor and on counsel for BOA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   There is no evidence in the record that Leeds was ever served with the Annulment Motion by personal service, by mail, or any other method. There is evidence in the record that attorney Ballstaedt never agreed to represent Leeds in relief from stay proceedings.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   2016 Statement at \u00b6 7.\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n   Moreover, under Local Rule 5005(c)(4), electronic service of notice to an attorney does not constitute service on the client unless the attorney is authorized to accept service by the client. Likewise, under Local Rule 5005(e)(4), an attorney's waiver of any right to receive notice by first class mail or personal service does not constitute an agreement to accept service or notice on behalf of a client. Thus, even if attorney Ballstaedt has any contact with a Chapter 7 client for whom a discharge was obtained more than six years earlier, his representation of Leeds expressly excluded this Annulment Motion, and electronic notice to Ballstaedt does not establish the contrary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   There is evidence, of course, that SFR served Rosenberg with the Annulment Motion. Combined with SFR's acknowledgement that Rosenberg actually represented SFR at the time of the very sale in question, however, that evidence gives new and virtually literal meaning to the adjective \"self-serving.\" Moreover, Rosenberg no longer serves on the Chapter 7 trustee panel in this judicial district. Thus, even if Rosenberg remotely could be considered disinterested in connection with the instant matter, he has no legal authority to respond to the Annulment Motion as a fiduciary on behalf of the bankruptcy estate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Under these circumstances, there is no evidence of adequate notice to any of\n   the parties, i.e., the debtor and the bankruptcy trustee, who apparently have standing to oppose the relief that SFR seeks.\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, notice reasonably calculated to apprise those parties of the requested relief and of the opportunity to object, has not been given.\n   <footnotemark>\n    23\n   </footnotemark>\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Third, the doctrine of unclean hands warrants denial of retroactive relief from stay\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Unclean hands is an equitable doctrine that bars a party from seeking equitable relief, reflecting the equitable maxim that \"he who seeks equity must do equity.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mfrs.'

But the record in those cases did not raise the same concerns present in this proceeding nor the same arguments raised in opposition to annulment of the automatic stay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Under the facts acknowledged by SFR, it acquired the Leeds Residence while engaging the assistance of Rosenberg, which violated his fiduciary duties to the bankruptcy estate. Additionally, Rosenberg likely violated his professional responsibility as an attorney to notify the UST and to obtain its written consent before providing legal services to SFR. By annulling the automatic stay in this instance, the court would become a participant in Rosenberg's and SFR's inequitable conduct. That this court will not do.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Finally, application of the Fjeldsted Factors separately warrants denial of the Annulment Motion.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    27\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Most of the previously categorized \"debtor factors\" do not favor retroactive relief from stay. Leeds has filed only one bankruptcy case and is not a repeat filer attempting to hinder and delay creditors. She has not sought a Chapter 13\n   super-discharge and has complied with applicable bankruptcy law. If the stay is not annulled, however, the prospect of injury to Leeds arises because legal title to the Leeds Residence has been restored to her. Moreover, Leeds would be on title to real property that she does not occupy, encumbered by a deed of trust securing a discharged loan that is hopelessly in default. A subsequent foreclosure or other resolution of the various claims could jeopardize the fresh start she commenced on September 20, 2011, when she received her Chapter 7 discharge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   None of the \"non-debtor factors\" favor retroactive relief from stay under the circumstances of this case. No one disputes that Butler HOA violated by the automatic stay when it foreclosed on the Leeds Residence. No one disputes that Butler HOA could have obtained relief from stay during the Leeds bankruptcy proceeding and then proceeded to complete a valid foreclosure sale. No one disputes that if BOA had filed a notice of default on its deed of trust during the Leeds bankruptcy proceeding without first obtaining relief from stay, any subsequent foreclosure sale would have been void. No one disputes that BOA could have obtained relief from stay during the Leeds bankruptcy proceeding and then proceeded to complete a valid foreclosure sale. No one disputes that BOA could have satisfied the priority portion of the Butler HOA lien to prevent the foreclosure sale from being completed. No one disputes that Rosenburg was legal counsel to SFR at the time SFR purchased the Leeds Residence. As between two creditors, i.e., BOA and Butler HOA, the extent of prejudice is extreme: annulment of the stay wipes out BOA's lien under Nevada law, the parties would seek relief from the summary judgment ruling in the Interpleader Action, and BOA is prevented from seeking recovery from Leeds.\n   <footnotemark>\n    28\n   </footnotemark>\n   If the stay is not annulled, the HOA foreclosure sale is void, the parties would proceed in accordance with the judgment in the Interpleader Action, and BOA is still prevented from seeking recovery from Leeds. As between the two creditors and SFR, there was no bona fide purchaser without knowledge because Rosenberg was the Chapter 7 trustee of the bankruptcy estate as well as counsel to SFR when SFR purchased the Leeds Residence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Most of the \"common factors\" do not favor retroactive relief from stay. Annulling the stay to restore parties to the \"status quo ante\" actually would result in Leeds returning to legal title to the Leeds Residence, Butler HOA having an unpaid priority assessment lien, BOA having a deed of trust securing a loan that was discharged by Leeds, and SFR having no legal interest in the Leeds Residence.\n   <footnotemark>\n    29\n   </footnotemark>\n   From a conceptual standpoint, the process is relatively easy but that is not what SFR seeks. Instead, it seeks to restore Butler\n   HOA to a position that it never sought, never obtained, and does not now seek: the ability to complete a foreclosure of its previous priority lien. Under the circumstances, SFR's request comes at little or no cost to Leeds or Butler HOA, but at a substantial economic and legal cost to BOA. Moreover, neither Leeds nor Butler HOA has taken any steps to set aside the foreclosure sale or to seek annulment of the automatic stay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   The remaining \"neutral factor\" is itself neutral under the circumstances of this proceeding. The Annulment Motion is the only request being made in an otherwise completed Chapter 7 proceeding. The outcome of the request has no additional impact on the economies or efficiencies of the federal courts because an order on a motion for relief from stay under Section 362(d), whether granted or denied, is appealable.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Zapata\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=656%20Fed.%20Appx.%20357\">\n    656 Fed.Appx. 357\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 358 (9th Cir. 2016) ;\n   <em>\n    Buenaventura v.

Feb. 11, 2014). The outcome of SFR's instant request may have an impact on the Interpleader Action, but the record establishes that the State Court effectively concluded the litigation by granting summary judgment in favor of BOA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   discussion at 191-92,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   . Even if this bankruptcy court enters an order granting the Annulment Motion, SFR would be required to seek relief from the summary judgment order entered by the State Court. Thus, retroactive relief from stay also may have no effect on judicial economies of the state courts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   Under these circumstances, when balancing the equities through application of the Fjelsted Factors, the court also concludes that retroactive relief from stay is inappropriate.\n   <footnotemark>\n    30\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   For all of the reasons set forth above,\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   <strong>\n    IT IS HEREBY ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   that SFR Investment Pool 1, LLC'S Motion to Retroactively Annul the Automatic Stay, Docket No. 77, be, and the same hereby is,\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-93\">\n    The instant motion arises because of certain issues raised in an interpleader action pending in the Eighth Judicial District Court, Clark County, Nevada (\"State Court\"), styled as\n    <em>\n     Alessi &amp; Koenig, LLC v.

Chapter 7 trustees in this judicial district, including Rosenberg, frequently sought and obtained court authorization to complete \"short sales\" of over-encumbered residential properties upon the priority lender's agreement to carve out a small portion of the sale proceeds for the bankruptcy estate. In a circumstance where a prior foreclosure sale is\n    <em>\n     void ab initio\n    </em>\n    , a new Chapter 7 trustee could exercise his or her business judgment as to whether to simply abandon the likely over-encumbered property again, or to attempt to negotiate a short sale with the residential lender prior to the foreclosure of a priority assessment lien by an HOA.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"24\">\n   <p id=\"p-117\">\n    Rule 1.1 requires a lawyer to \"provide competent representation to a client\" that includes \"the legal knowledge, skill, thoroughness and preparation reasonably necessary for the representation.\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"27\">\n   <p id=\"p-118\">\n    SFR's assertion at the hearing that Rosenberg's knowledge of the Leeds bankruptcy should not be imputed to SFR is unpersuasive.
