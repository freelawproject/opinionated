The Motion to Deem asked the bankruptcy court to deem Creditor's Motion for Determination a complaint objecting to the discharge of the debts owed by the Debtor, and objecting to the discharge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   On September 27, 2017, the bankruptcy court held an evidentiary hearing on Creditor's Motion to Deem. At the hearing, Debtor asserted it would be improper for the bankruptcy court to consider the Motion for Determination as a timely-filed complaint because Debtor never received \"actual notice\" of the Motion for Determination (Dkt. # 2 at pp. 453-471). Creditor argued that Debtor received \"actual notice\" of the Motion for Determination when his lawyer, Mr. Robert DeMarco, who represented him at his creditor's meeting and had held a retainer for purposes of responding to an objection to discharge claim until August 31, 2017, was served with the Motion for Determination on August 14, 2017. Mr. DeMarco argued that it was not sufficient notice to simply serve debtor's counsel. Mr. DeMarco argued that to show actual notice to Debtor, Creditor had to show evidence that the Motion for Determination was mailed to Debtor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   After hearing evidence and arguments of counsel for Debtor and Creditor, the bankruptcy court ruled that actual notice had been provided to Debtor, and explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   [I]n order for the Court to reach the question of whether the debtor had actual notice, the underlying presumption or predicate is that, in fact, the creditor has not complied with the rules. So it appears to the Court that requiring compliance with the rules in order to show actual notice is sort of bootstrapping one against the other, or maybe its circular....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   But for the reasons stated by the Court in the\n   <em>\n    Thompson\n   </em>\n   case and the cases cited therein for determining whether the debtor had actual notice, service on counsel is sufficient. Particularly in this case where the lawsuit had been filed before and the debtor hired counsel for the purpose of defending them in a discharge/dischargeability action. And that was disclosed at the 341 meeting. So the debtor had reason to anticipate that a 727 or a 523 action would be filed.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     And indeed it was filed, the motion was filed and served on counsel that was retained for that very purpose.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   Therefore, the Court finds that for the purpose of the Relation Back Doctrine, if you will, the filing of the motion objecting to discharge is sufficient, in this case.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   (Dkt. # 6 at pp. 30-31) (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   On October 30, 2017, Debtor filed his Notice of Appeal (Dkt. # 1).

Mr. DeMarco represented Debtor at this creditor's meeting. The transcript from the meeting demonstrates that at the time Mr. DeMarco was served with the Motion for Determination, Mr. Demarco had been paid by Debtor and was holding an $18,000 retainer in a trust to defend him and object to discharge claims in his bankruptcy. At the creditor's meeting Mr. DeMarco stated the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   Mr. DeMarco: Well, I'm not saying it's not property of the estate. But under the terms of the agreement, he effectively bought my services up to $18,000 for the sole purpose and limited purpose of representing him personally in an objection to discharge claim. So the value to the estate is the asset of that agreement.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   (Dkt. # 7 at p. 7).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Matter of Sadkin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6123292,10524414\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/36/473/\">\n    36 F.3d 473\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 476 (5th Cir. 1994) (finding actual notice was provided to creditor and satisfied due process concerns through the attendance of creditor's representative at a creditors' meeting where the claim was discussed, even though amended list of exceptions was not served on creditor).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Further, Mr. DeMarco drafted and signed Debtor's response to Creditor's Motion for Determination, which was filed August 29, 2017 (Dkt. # 7 at p. 7). At the hearing on the Motion to Deem, Mr. DeMarco stated that after his receipt of the Motion for Determination, which was filed and served on Mr. DeMarco on August 14, 2017, Mr. DeMarco communicated with Debtor (Dkt. # 7 at p. 7). There is also evidence that Creditor served the Motion for Determination on Debtor's wife by mailing it to her at her residence that she shares with Debtor, and also served the motion on two companies Debtor owns or controls via the creditor matrix (Dkt. # 7 at p. 7).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   The Court finds that the bankruptcy court did not err in finding that Debtor received notice of the Motion for Determination when his counsel, Mr. DeMarco, was served with it. Mr. DeMarco had been hired for the very purpose of defending a discharge/dischargeability action. \"[A]ll constitutional due process requires in this case is that he have 'notice reasonably calculated, under all the circumstances, to apprise [Debtor] of the pendency of the action and afford [Debtor] an opportunity to present [his] objections.' \"\n   <em>\n    Sam\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10536278\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/894/778/#p781\">\n    894 F.2d at 781\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Mullane v.

Lastly, the bankruptcy court's finding that service on Debtor's attorney constituted actual notice to Debtor is consistent with Fifth Circuit precedent of avoiding a dismissal with prejudice unless: (1) the delay has been caused by the plaintiff himself, not by his attorney; (2) there is actual prejudice to the defendant; and (3) the delay has been caused by intentional conduct.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Millan v.

In this case, these factors are not present.
