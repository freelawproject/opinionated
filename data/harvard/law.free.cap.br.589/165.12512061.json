LATHAM, JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   This dispute arises from harassing and provocative text messages sent during a span of four-and-a-half months in 2015. Between March and July 2015, plaintiff Joel Plys and his friends received over 20 disparaging text messages from more than 12 different cellphone numbers. They were almost exclusively about Plaintiff's daughter's paternity.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Through personal investigation\n   and manipulation of his social media access settings, Plaintiff came to understand that debtor-defendant Danilo Geronimo Ang, Jr. was responsible. He reported this to the La Mesa Police Department. A police detective questioned Defendant, who confessed to sending the texts. The harassing messages then abruptly stopped.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiff and his wife, Jackie Plys, sued Defendant in small claims court. That court awarded them $10,150. Defendant appealed. Following a trial de novo, the San Diego Superior Court affirmed the judgment and tacked on $1,354 in additional costs and attorney's fees. Within a week, Defendant and Svea Fujiko Komori (collectively, \"Debtors\") filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Plaintiff initially sought a nondischargeability finding of the state court judgment under \u00a7\u00a7 523(a)(2), (a)(4), and (a)(6).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   But he brought his complaint nearly two months after Rule 4007's deadline for asserting such claims. So the court dismissed them. It, however, allowed Plaintiff to pursue a nondischargeability judgment under \u00a7 1328(a)(4), which was not time-barred. It also dismissed Ms. Komori as a defendant. The court now holds the entire state court judgment nondischargeable under \u00a7 1328(a)(4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

The State Court Litigation\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The Plyses sued Defendant in small claims in December 2015. Case No. 37-2015-00326756-SC-SC-CTL.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Initially, that court awarded them $10,000 in damages and $150 in costs, but it vacated the judgment.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201409\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   After a new trial, the small claims court entered a judgment identical to the earlier one.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201409\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Defendant appealed to the San Diego Superior Court, which found the appeal lacked substantial merit and was not filed in good faith.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201409\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff's Trial Ex. E. It therefore affirmed the small claims judgment and augmented it as follows: (1) $5,000 to both Plaintiff and Ms. Plys ($10,000 total); (2) $466.23 in pre-judgment costs; and (3) $1,000 in attorney's fees. Plaintiff's Trial Ex. E (the \"State Court Judgment\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Defendant's Bankruptcy Case\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Debtors filed a voluntary Chapter 13 petition seven days after the State Court Judgment was entered (Bankr. ECF No. 1). They disclosed the Plyses' $10,000 unsecured claim on their Schedule E, characterizing it as disputed (Bankr. ECF No. 11, p. 19). And their Statement of Financial Affairs listed the state court action as pending. (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   , p. 30). The court sent a notice of the bankruptcy filing to the Plyses the following day (Bankr. ECF No. 10). It informed them that the deadline to file a complaint challenging the dischargeability of debts under \u00a7\u00a7 523(a)(2) and (a)(4) was April 4, 2017.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    C. The Adversary Proceeding\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Plaintiff brought his initial adversary complaint on May 24, 2017 (ECF No. 1) seeking to hold the State Court Judgment nondischargeable under \u00a7\u00a7 523(a)(2), (a)(4), and (a)(6) (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   ). And he requested that a trustee investigate whether grounds exist to deny Debtors' discharge under \u00a7 727(c)(2) (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   ). Debtors moved to dismiss the complaint as untimely under Rule 4007 (ECF No. 5). The court agreed and dismissed Plaintiff's claims (ECF No. 8).\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   But it did so without prejudice as it appeared the complaint might be cured by amendment (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   ). Specifically, the court explained that \u00a7 1328(a)(4) has language very similar to \u00a7 523(a)(6)'s, but the former was not subject to the April 4 filing deadline (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   FED. R. BANKR. P. 4007(b) (\"A complaint other than under \u00a7 523(c) may be filed at any time.\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Plaintiff accordingly amended his complaint to seek a nondischargeability finding under \u00a7 1328(a)(4) (ECF No. 10). Debtors' answer asserted that Ms. Komori was wrongly named as a defendant (ECF No. 15).\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   They explained she was not a party to any of the state court proceedings. At the November 15, 2017 pre-trial status conference, the court heard oral argument on her potential dismissal (ECF No. 28). It concluded that res judicata precluded Plaintiff from suing her here.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Palomar Mobilehome Park Ass'n v. City of San Marcos,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10512496\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/989/362/#p364\">\n    989 F.2d 362\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 364 (9th Cir. 1993) (\"California, as most states, recognizes that the doctrine of res judicata will bar not only those claims actually litigated in a prior proceeding, but also claims that could have been litigated.\"). Plaintiff agreed, without objection, to her dismissal (ECF No. 29).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The court then tried the matter. Plaintiff and Defendant were the only witnesses called.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Plaintiff's Post-Trial Application to Enter Documents into Evidence\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   After the trial, Plaintiff realized that three exhibits he had filed as attachments to his first amended complaint were not received in evidence (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 12). They include: (1) a letter from Marissa Pyle; (2) a declaration from Marguerite Lehman; and (3) a declaration from Erica Birkholz (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff's Trial Ex. I, J, and K. So Plaintiff filed a post-trial application to enter these documents into evidence (ECF No. 37). All three describe Defendant's employing harassment methods similar to those in this case. Defendant did not respond to this application.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The court understands that Defendant is not an attorney. It thus recognizes that his failure to object to Plaintiff's application might stem from a lack of understanding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Nevertheless, \"[i]t is a fundamental rule of evidence that an objection not timely made is waived.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v. Jamerson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"984516\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/549/1263/#p1266\">\n    549 F.2d 1263\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1266-67 (9th Cir. 1977). Indeed, \"if no objection is made at the time the evidence is offered and received, its admissibility generally cannot be challenged on appeal.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v. Wilson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1474045\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/690/1267/#p1273\">\n    690 F.2d 1267\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1273-74 (9th Cir. 1982) (first citing\n   <em>\n    Vitello v.

But the court concludes that admitting the proposed exhibits into evidence would not constitute plain error. First, Defendant's constitutional rights will not be affected. The only conceivably relevant provision is the Sixth Amendment's Confrontation Clause.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   U.S. CONST. amend. VI (\"In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right ... to be confronted with the witnesses against him[.]\"). That protection is not implicated here because it applies solely to criminal and quasi-criminal matters.\n   <em>\n    In re Denh Nhiet Chu\n   </em>\n   , BAP No. NV-07-1243-McMoPa,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2008%20WL%208444805\">\n    2008 WL 8444805\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *10-11, 2008 Bankr.

An adversary proceeding is not tantamount to a criminal proceeding, and a nondischargeability judgment is not a criminal penalty.\n   <em>\n    In re Denh Nhiet Chu\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2008%20WL%208444805\">\n    2008 WL 8444805\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *11, 2008 Bankr. LEXIS 4736, at *29.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Turning to the documents, they tend to prove two things: (1) Defendant's propensity to send harassing text messages; and (2) the texter's identity in this case.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff's Trial Ex. I, J, and K. Although the former purpose is prohibited character evidence, the latter is admissible because Defendant disputes that he sent the subject text messages.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   FED. R. EVID. 404(a)(1), (b) ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hirst v. Gertzen\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"562120\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/676/1252/#p1262\">\n    676 F.2d 1252\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1262 (9th Cir. 1982) (evidence of prior acts is admissible to prove identity when that is disputed). Moreover, the court considers these documents to be cumulative evidence on the identity issue, which means their admission does not affect a substantial right.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. Soulard\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"16059\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/730/1292/#p1303\">\n    730 F.2d 1292\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1303 (9th Cir. 1984) (when evidence is cumulative, the error in admitting it, if any, is not prejudicial);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Fortier v.

Consequently, because no plain error will arise from doing so, the court\n   <strong>\n    admits\n   </strong>\n   Plaintiff's Trial Exhibits I, J, and K into evidence for the limited purpose of proving the texter's identity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    III. FACTUAL BACKGROUND AND FINDINGS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Having carefully considered the testimony and other evidence, the court makes the following factual findings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The Text Messages and Underlying Judgment\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The parties are swing dancers. Plaintiff has been an instructor since 1999. Defendant started dancing around the same time. And he eventually began hosting informal practices and planning dance events. Animosity arose between the parties because they considered one another competitors. Their relationship deteriorated as a result.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Defendant testified that Plaintiff sought to exclude him from local dance groups. He says Plaintiff gossiped about him and tried to persuade other dancers not to\n   associate with him. Defendant also accuses Plaintiff of attempting to extort money from him. And when that failed, Plaintiff allegedly organized a dance event that conflicted with one Defendant had been planning. It is clear that these incidents stirred up ill will in Defendant against Plaintiff.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The first text message was sent on March 20, 2015. Plaintiff's Trial Ex. A and B. It went to Whitney Shay from an unknown number. Plaintiff's Trial Ex. A and B. The text insinuated that Ms. Plys - who was about eight months along at the time - was made pregnant by Jeff Eldridge, not Plaintiff.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiff's Trial Ex. A and B. Shay immediately contacted Eldridge. Eldridge then sent reply texts to determine the texter's identity. He and Shay each received a handful of additional text messages from the mystery person, most of which were crude and explicit in their content. Plaintiff's Trial Ex. A and B. They chose not to tell the Plyses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   A month later - less than a week before the baby was born - Plaintiff received a text message from a different number accusing Ms. Plys of having an affair and carrying Eldridge's child. Plaintiff's Trial Ex. A and B. After speaking to Eldridge, Plaintiff learned about the March texts. Plaintiff's Trial Ex. A; Defendant's Trial Ex. 2. Within days of the newborn's birth, Plaintiff received a new message - from yet another phone number - that read: \"Oh, that's sweet of you to hold Jeff's baby[.]\" Plaintiff's Trial Ex. A and B. After calming their initial panic, the Plyses determined that the text referred to a photo they had posted on Facebook. Defendant's Trial Ex. 2. Over the next month, Plaintiff received nine more text messages from five new phone numbers. Plaintiff's Trial Ex. A and B. They continued the upsetting language, referred to the Plyses in derogatory terms, and insisted that Eldridge is the baby's biological father.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiff's Trial Ex. A and B.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Plaintiff testified that he posted a picture on Facebook of himself and the baby asleep, with the photo's privacy settings limited to \"friends only.\" That means only users who were his Facebook friend could view the photo. He then received a text message saying, \"Wow everyday [sic] that baby looks more like Jeff even though you're sleeping by it[.]\" Plaintiff's Trial Ex. A and B. Plaintiff received another text responding to a picture displayed on Eldridge's Facebook page (also limited to \"friends only\"). Defendant's Trial Ex. 2. Plaintiff and Eldridge thus realized the texter was one of their mutual friends.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   A private investigator advised Plaintiff to continue to manipulate his social media privacy settings to uncover the texter's identity. He did, and narrowed the search down to three individuals, including Defendant. Plaintiff's Trial Ex. A and B; Defendant's Trial Ex. 2. On June 29, Plaintiff posted the same photo three times with three different captions; each was distributed so that the only person who could see a particular caption was one of the suspects. Plaintiff's Trial Ex. B; Defendant's Trial Ex. 2. The caption that Defendant - and only Defendant - could see mentioned that the baby \"has Daddy's eyes!\" Plaintiff's Trial Ex. B. Within hours, Plaintiff received a message that read, \"The baby does have Jeff's eyes[.]\" Plaintiff's Trial Ex. A and B. Shay also received a text about a different staged picture that only Defendant could see. Plaintiff's Trial Ex. A and B.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   In late June 2015, Plaintiff turned this information over to the police detective. Plaintiff's Trial Ex. B. On July 8 - a day after the last text was sent - the detective interviewed Defendant at work (an insurance office). Plaintiff's Trial Ex. B. After first denying any involvement, Defendant admitted to sending and enlisting others to send the text messages.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6561265,6560908,644285\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/747/1324/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   He also allowed the detective to forensically download his cellphone.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6561265,6560908,644285\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/747/1324/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   According to his police report, it contained several references to the Plyses, including mention that the parties did not get along.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6561265,6560908,644285\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/747/1324/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   After Defendant confessed, the Plyses obtained a civil harassment temporary restraining order against him under California Code of Civil Procedure (\"CCP\") \u00a7 527.6. Plaintiff's Trial Ex. B;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Case No. 37-2015-00022550-CU-HR-CTL (the \"Restraining Order Proceeding\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   And in November 2015, the San Diego Superior Court entered a final restraining order against Defendant. Plaintiff's Trial Exhibit C;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Case No. 37-2015-00022550-CU-HR-CTL. In addition, Defendant pleaded guilty to one count of disturbing the peace under California Penal Code \u00a7 415(2). Plaintiff's Trial Exhibit D.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Finally, the Plyses sued Defendant.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Case No. 37-2015-00326756-SC-SC-CTL. As noted above, the small claims court awarded them $10,150. The Superior Court affirmed and increased that judgment to $11,466.23. Plaintiff's Trial Ex. E.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <strong>\n    B. The Texter's Identity\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Defendant's case-in-chief was devoted largely to denying all involvement in the harassment. He testified that he does not know who is responsible for the text messages. But he believes Plaintiff used them to target and disgrace him. Defendant points to the Plyses' online blog, which accuses him of sending the messages.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defendant's Trial Ex. 1, 2, and 3. It also broadcasts his personal affairs, including details of the various court proceedings.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defendant's Trial Ex. 1, 2, and 3. The posts recount the case's facts in great detail, often in undesirable language.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Defendant further asserted that the police detective intimidated him and made him feel to be under duress. His confession was thus coerced and given out of desperation. In addition, he claimed that no one involved in the state court actions - including his criminal defense attorney - gave him a fair opportunity to defend himself. Rather, the small claims court judge was biased against him, and the Superior Court judge simply rubber-stamped the judgment on appeal. The court does not find Defendant credible or persuasive on any of these points.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   The overwhelming weight of the evidence shows convincingly that Defendant sent at least some of the text messages.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   To start, Plaintiff's manipulation of his Facebook settings, such that only Defendant could see certain pictures that directly correlate with the subject texts, strongly suggests that Defendant contributed to drafting the messages. Defendant attempts to discredit Plaintiff's testimony on this point by asserting that everyone can see his\n   Facebook page. The court is puzzled at this argument. To the extent he is saying Plaintiff could not alter a photo's privacy settings to limit access to only one person, he is wrong.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Ehling v. Monmouth-Ocean Hosp. Serv. Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3873445\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/961/659/#p668\">\n    961 F.Supp.2d 659\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 668 (D.N.J. 2013) (\"Facebook allows users to select privacy settings for their Facebook walls. Access can be limited to the user's Facebook friends, to particular groups or individuals, or to just the users.\"). The court is likewise unpersuaded by the suggestion that, on each occasion, a third party saw the picture on Defendant's Facebook page and then sent Plaintiff the corresponding message without Defendant's cooperation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Moreover, the text messages stopped as soon as the police detective met with Defendant. Defendant provided no explanation for this timing. The court thus concludes that he was responsible for the texts and ended them once law enforcement intervened. Additionally, three of the phone numbers at issue match those Defendant used when he was sending inappropriate messages to Ms. Lehman. Plaintiff's Trial Ex. B and J.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   The court also rejects the argument that Plaintiff would devote tremendous time and treasure to chasing Defendant throughout state and federal courts in a deliberate scheme to tarnish his reputation. Such actions would essentially require serial perjury in at least four separate judicial proceedings. That seems unlikely given the modest amount in controversy. Indeed, it is not well taken that the Plyses would seek psychological treatment and a paternity test just to further a scheme to shame Defendant.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff Trial Ex. G; Defendant's Trial Ex. 2. The court recognizes that the Plyses' blog highlights intimate details of Defendant's life. That was certainly provocative and ill-advised on their part. But the court fails to see how announcing details of court proceedings and other public records necessarily indicates ill will.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   Moreover, Defendant's testimony is inconsistent. On the one hand, he seems to suggest that Plaintiff was actually being harassed (i.e., he did not fabricate the text messages). On the other, his theory is that Plaintiff is targeting him. For both statements to be true, Plaintiff must have chosen not to pursue his actual harasser and instead to exploit the text messages as an opportunity to vilify Defendant. This is not a convincing suggestion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Nor is the court persuaded that Defendant's police confession was false or otherwise invalid. There is no evidence of that. Defendant may well have been nervous and anxious.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff's Trial Ex. B. But the court fails to see how a voluntary interview in an insurance company's office rises to the level of coercion. Likewise, the argument that the state court judges discriminated against Defendant is implausible on the current record. Defendant's conclusory, self-serving accusations - apparently made for the first time in this court - are insufficient to invalidate the State Court Judgment. His sentiment that the state court judges \"listened to [him], but did not hear [him]\" is perhaps not an uncommon one among unsuccessful litigants. But the court will not disregard the state court's final judgment based solely on Defendant's self-serving perception of bias or prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Lastly, and most significantly, the state courts have already found Defendant\n   liable for the text messages.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff's Trial Ex.

It consequently finds that the State Court Judgment is nondischargeable under \u00a7 1328(a)(4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Defendant's Conduct Was Willful\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   The facts show that Defendant had a subjective motive to injure the Plyses. The text messages contained derogatory language and inflammatory accusations plainly designed to harass and cause emotional distress. And Defendant - at least initially - sought to engender paranoia and marital strife between the Plyses. Moreover, several of the texts were timed to aggravate these reactions, being sent for example within days of: (1) the newborn's birth; (2) Ms. Plys's first Mother's Day; and (3) Plaintiff's first Father's Day. Plaintiff's Trial Ex. A and B. These circumstances point clearly to Defendant's intent to harm Plaintiff.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Yet even if Defendant did not intend to injure Plaintiff, he must surely have understood\n   that the text messages were substantially likely to harass, annoy, and cause distress. Indeed, Defendant is presumed to know the natural consequences of his actions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Le Hawk Le\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"114\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%205956652\">\n    2016 WL 5956652\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *5. Anger, frustration, and mental anguish were the predictable result of hearing repeated allegations of his wife's committing adultery and carrying his friend's child. There is no reasonable argument that Plaintiff's injuries were not the ordinary response to the text messages he received.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Accordingly, the court finds that Plaintiff's injury resulted from Defendant's willful conduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Defendant Acted with Malice\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   As explained, \u00a7 1328(a)(4) does not require both willful and malicious conduct.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Waag\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4128442\" index=\"115\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/418/373/#p377\">\n    418 B.R. at 377\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . So the court could find liability based on willfulness alone.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4128442\" index=\"116\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/418/373/#p377\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Nevertheless, for the sake of analytical completeness, it will address whether Defendant acted maliciously. The court infers malice through the nature of Defendant's willful actions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Ormsby\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3508541,4139366\" index=\"117\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/591/1199/\">\n    591 F.3d at 1207\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Even so, the totality of the circumstances leaves no doubt that Defendant acted maliciously in sending the text messages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   First, Defendant acted intentionally. The texts were no accident. And their content was neither subtle nor humorous. Indeed, he sent particularly outrageous text messages at times calculated to do the most damage. They were also designed to inflict emotional harm. Additionally, these actions were wrongful. The state court found Defendant liable for vexing and harassing the Plyses. And this court cannot reasonably conclude otherwise. Moreover, Defendant's wrongful intentional conduct caused Plaintiff's injury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   The final element of malicious injury is lack of a just cause or excuse, which Defendant has the burden to prove.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Hagele\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"118\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%203965899\">\n    2016 WL 3965899\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *6. He has not done so. Moreover, even if a justification existed, Defendant's specific intent to injure Plaintiff would likely have negated it.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Armstrong\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"119\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2006%20WL%202850527\">\n    2006 WL 2850527\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *11. The court concludes that Defendant acted with malice when he sent the text messages to Plaintiff. Plaintiff has thus also satisfied the malicious prong of \u00a7 1328(a)(4). The court consequently finds that Defendant acted both willfully and maliciously.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Plaintiff Suffered a Personal Injury\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   As explained above, under \u00a7 1328(a)(4), Plaintiff's injury cannot be to property. But it does not necessarily have to be a bodily harm or even a traditional tort.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    In re Grossman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4330592\" index=\"120\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/538/34/#p39\">\n    538 B.R. at 42\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . To determine whether Plaintiff's injury meets this standard, the court looks to state law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Toste\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"121\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%203908139\">\n    2014 WL 3908139\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3, 2014 Bankr.

And the State Court Judgment was awarded to compensate the Plyses for their annoyance and emotional distress, not for any property or financial loss. The court therefore concludes that Plaintiff's injury was a personal one.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   The court notes that the\n   <em>\n    In re Smith\n   </em>\n   court stated, in \u00a7 157(b)(5) context, that sexual harassment claims are not personal injury torts.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3584876\" index=\"124\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/389/902/#p908\">\n    389 B.R. at 908\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Although civil harassment is modernly a statutory tort, it is rooted in California common law. To be sure, CCP \u00a7 527.6\"was passed to supplement the existing common law torts of invasion of privacy and intentional infliction of emotional distress.\"\n   <em>\n    Nebel v.

Consequently, civil harassment is not a tort solely because of its statutory designation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   Furthermore, California small claims courts do not hold litigants to the same legal formalities as do courts of record.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   CAL. CODE CIV. P. \u00a7 116.310(a) (no formal pleading is necessary to initiate a small claims action). The Plyses did not even have to plead a cause of action. In fact, the record does not expressly identify one. So the underlying claims may conceivably have been for the common law wrongs of invasion of privacy or intentional infliction of emotional distress.
