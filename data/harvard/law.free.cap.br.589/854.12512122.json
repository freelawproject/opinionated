INTRODUCTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Appellant Laurel Greenstein appeals from several orders issued by the bankruptcy court, relating to her Chapter 7 bankruptcy, and related adversary proceedings. She contends that her home (the \"Property\") was wrongfully foreclosed on by Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., and several corporate representatives,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   (collectively, \"Wells Fargo\") in violation of the automatic stay in her case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In a 63-page Amended Consolidated Memorandum of Decision, the bankruptcy court denied Greenstein's Motion to Set Aside Foreclosure Sale in violation of Automatic Stay (\"Set Aside Motion\"), and granted Motions to Dismiss Adversary Proceedings with Prejudice as to All Defendants. (Appellant's Appendix of Evidence (\"AA\") vol. I, 135-99, ECF No. 27.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   ) While Greenstein sets forth seven issues on appeal, the substance of her appeal focuses on the validity of an in rem order (the \"In Rem Order\") issued by another bankruptcy court in an action involving debtor Roger Lipkis (the \"Lipkis Action\"). Among other things, Greenstein claims the In Rem Order was invalid because a fraudulent deed was presented in the Lipkis Action, which purported to transfer ownership rights in the Property from Greenstein to Lipkis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Marty A. Duran, Patricia M. Duran, and The Duran Family Trust (collectively, the \"Duran Defendants\") purchased the Property from Wells Fargo two years after the foreclosure sale. (Duran Defendants' Appendix of Evidence (\"DER\") 8, ECF No. 30-1, 30-2.) Greenstein filed adversary proceedings against the Duran Defendants as part of her Chapter 7 bankruptcy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Greenstein's Opening Brief and excerpts of record are riddled with procedural defects. She fails to adequately cite to the record, which makes it difficult for the Court, much less her opponents, to sort through her arguments. In any event, for the reasons explained below, the Court\n   <strong>\n    AFFIRMS\n   </strong>\n   the bankruptcy court with respect to all of Greenstein's consolidated appeals.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    II. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   This case arises from several bankruptcies, adversary proceedings, and related civil actions. This convoluted procedural history arises from Wells Fargo foreclosing\n   on Greenstein's home after she defaulted on her payments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The First Civil Action\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On October 13, 2011, Greenstein filed an action in California state court, wherein she challenged, among other things, Wells Fargo's standing to foreclose on her home (the \"First Civil Action\"). (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AA vol. I, 141; Wells Fargo Appellee's Supp. Appendix (\"SA\") vol. III, 660-71, ECF No. 31-5, 31-6.) At a hearing on February 10, 2012, Wells Fargo's counsel informed the court and Greenstein that it obtained a grant deed, which purported to transfer title of the Property from Greenstein to Roger Lipkis (the \"Lipkis Deed\"). (Appellant's Opening Brief (\"AOB\") 16-17, ECF No. 26; SA vol. III, 678.) The Lipkis Deed, on its face, appears to have been signed by Greenstein, notarized by a notary public, and recorded with the Los Angeles County Recorder's Office on November 10, 2011. (AA vol. II, 367.) The court ultimately sustained Wells Fargo's demurrer, and dismissed the First Civil Action with prejudice. (AA vol. I, 49; SA vol. III, 674-76.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    B. The Lipkis Bankruptcy, In Rem Order, and Foreclosure\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On November 18, 2011, Roger Lipkis filed a Chapter 13 bankruptcy. (DER 220). As it turns out, the reasons that he filed for bankruptcy are not germane to the Court's analysis, but the Lipkis Deed is.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The origin of the Lipkis Deed is murky. At one time, Greenstein claimed that she \"strongly believe[d] [she knew] who set this fake Grant Deed up and why, but [she couldn't] prove it.\" (AA vol. II, 373.) Now, she simply maintains that it was a fraud.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   After Wells Fargo learned of the Lipkis Deed in the First Civil Action, it sought a stipulation to exclude the Property from the Lipkis bankruptcy estate. It needed to do this so that it could foreclose on the Property, which was purportedly part of the Lipkis estate by virtue of the Lipkis Deed. (AA vol. II, 412-16.) On March 19, 2012, the court accepted Wells Fargo and Lipkis's stipulation for relief from the automatic stay in the Lipkis Action, pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20362\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 362\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(4),\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   and entered an order reflecting the same (as defined above, the \"In Rem Order\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ; AA vol. II, 390-91.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Mimicking verbatim Section 362(d)(4), the In Rem Order explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   If recorded in compliance with applicable State laws governing notices of interests or liens in real property, an order entered under paragraph (4)\n   <strong>\n    shall be binding in any other case under this title purporting to affect such real property filed not later than 2 years after the date of the entry of such order by the court, except that a debtor in a subsequent case under this title may move for relief from such order based upon changed circumstances or for good cause shown, after notice and a hearing\n   </strong>\n   . Any Federal, State, or local governmental unit that accepts notices of interests or liens in real property shall accept any certified copy of an order described in this subsection for indexing and recording.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   (AA vol. II, 391 (emphasis added).) The In Rem Order also found that \"an interest in the Property was impermissibly transferred to [Lipkis] without the knowledge of [Lipkis]. Without [Lipkis's] consent, his Chapter 13 bankruptcy case proceeding is being used for an improper purpose as part of a scheme to delay, hinder and defraud creditors....\" (AA vol. II, 392.) Greenstein did not appeal the In Rem Order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   On March 12, 2012, Wells Fargo recorded the In Rem Order at the County Recorder's Office. (AA vol. II, 388; DER 114-21.) Greenstein was not initially served with the In Rem Order, but admittedly learned of it on May 31, 2012, and received a copy of it on June 1, 2012. (AA vol. I, 143 (citing Greenstein's own admissions that she received a copy of the In Rem Order), 169-70.) Greenstein did not seek modification of the In Rem Order after receiving a copy of it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   On May 14, 2012, the trustee recorded a new Notice of Sale. (SA vol. III, 707.) On May 31, 2012, Greenstein filed her Chapter 7 bankruptcy. (AA vol. I, 144; SA vol. I, 1.) On July 11, 2012, the Property was sold by foreclosure to Wells Fargo. (AA vol. I, 34-35.) The Duran Defendants purchased the property a few years later. (DER 8.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Greenstein's Chapter 7 Bankruptcy &amp; Related Actions\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Greenstein attempted on several occasions to invalidate the In Rem Order through the filing of adversary proceedings in her Chapter 7 case, and the filing of a second state court action. The bankruptcy court discharged Greenstein's debt on September 29, 2015. (SA vol. I, 201.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <em>\n    1. Adversary Proceedings &amp; Second State Court Action\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   In her first adversary case against Wells Fargo, the court granted Wells Fargo's motion to dismiss, and dismissed the adversary proceeding based on Greenstein's lack of standing. (AA vol. I, 145-46; SA vol. II, 472.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Greenstein filed a second adversary proceeding against Wells Fargo, but voluntarily dismissed it before the hearing. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AA vol. I, 146-47.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   On January 2, 2013, Greenstein filed another state court action against Wells Fargo, and various attorneys for Wells Fargo and Lipkis (the \"Second Civil Action\"). (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AA vol. I, 149.) She asserted claims for intentional infliction of emotional distress, fraud, conspiracy, breach of contract, and slander of title. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) She based these claims on the same challenges she asserted to the In Rem Order in her bankruptcy case, and related adversary proceedings. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   SA vol. III, 714-43.) The state court ultimately sustained Wells Fargo's demurrer to Greenstein's amended complaint without leave to amend. (SA vol. III, 748-51.) Greenstein has not appealed, and the state court's judgement is final. (AA vol. I, 149.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <em>\n    2. Motion to Set Aside &amp; Appeal\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   On December 27, 2013, Greenstein filed a Motion to Set Aside Sale of Property Made in Violation of Automatic Stay (\"Set Aside Motion\") in her main bankruptcy action, which challenged the In Rem Order on several grounds. (AA vol. I, 13.) The Bankruptcy Court denied her motion on claim preclusion principles. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AA vol. I, 157.) Greenstein appealed to the Ninth Circuit Bankruptcy Appellate Panel (\"BAP\"), and the BAP reversed and remanded. (AA vol. I, 112, 128.) The BAP requested additional findings by the bankruptcy court explaining its application of collateral estoppel and/or res judicata. (AA vol. I, 127-32.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   On remand, the bankruptcy court declined to apply collateral estoppel or res judicata, but denied Greenstein's Set Aside\n   Motion because: 1) the bankruptcy court in the Lipkis Action had jurisdiction to issue the In Rem Order, and Greenstein could not collaterally attack that final order through her Set Aside Motion (AA vol. I, 158-64); 2) Greenstein was afforded due process, despite not originally receiving notice of the In Rem Order, because she could have challenged it prior to the sale of the Property, but chose not to for two months; (AA vol. I, 165-71); and 3) to the extent Greenstein challenged the In Rem Order as being improperly granted, as opposed to void, she could not do so via collateral attack. (AA vol. I, 172.) Greenstein now appeals the bankruptcy court's Order on her Set Aside Motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <em>\n    3. Dismissal of Greenstein's Third Adversary Proceeding\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   On October 6, 2015, Greenstein filed her third adversary proceeding against Wells Fargo. (SA vol. II, 241.) She alleged violations of various bankruptcy rules, fraud, fraud on the court, violation of the automatic stay, perjury, and sought a declaration that the In Rem Order was void. (\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20362\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ) On December 15, 2015, the Bankruptcy Court granted Wells Fargo's motion to dismiss Greenstein's complaint, but granted her leave to amend. (SA vol. III, 540-47.) The bankruptcy court permitted Greenstein leave to amend over Wells Fargo's protest since Greenstein received her bankruptcy discharge in September 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   On February 16, 2016, Greenstein filed her First Amended Adversary Complaint (\"FAAC\"), which named several defendants in addition to Wells Fargo, including Roger Lipkis, Steven Wolvek, Dean Reeves, Marisol Nagata, Robert Little, Robert Bailey, John Stumpf, Robert Lindaman, and the Duran Defendants. (AA vol. II, 285.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   On March 21, 2016, Wells Fargo (along with the associated corporate defendants) moved to dismiss the FAAC. (SA vol. III, 569.) The Duran Defendants, Steven Wolvek (Lipkis's attorney), and Marisol Nagata (Wells Fargo's attorney that appeared in the Lipkis Action) also moved to dismiss. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AA vol. I, 191-93.) On October 31, 2017, after several hearings and continuances, the bankruptcy court granted all defendants' motions to dismiss, without leave to amend, as detailed in its 63-page Amended Consolidated Memorandum of Decision. (AA vol. I, 174-93.) The bankruptcy court then issued separate orders of dismissal for each of the defendants, which led to Greenstein's multiple appeals. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AA vol. I, 201-11.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Greenstein's Appeal\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   On November 6, 2017, Greenstein appealed from the bankruptcy court's Order dismissing the FAAC against Wells Fargo in the third adversary proceeding. (AA vol. I, 1.) She subsequently filed individual appeals relating to the bankruptcy court's dismissal of Nagata, and the Duran Defendants, as well as its denial of her Set Aside Motion. On January 29, 2018, the Court consolidated all of these appeals because they relate to the same nucleus of fact. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 11.) The consolidated appeals are now before the Court for decision, and have been briefed by the parties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <strong>\n    III. ISSUES ON APPEAL\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Greenstein articulates several issues on appeal. (AOB 11;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Wells Fargo's Reply Brief (\"WFR\") 3-4, ECF No. 31.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Distilled below in the most basic terms are the issues:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   1. Whether Greenstein can prevail on appeal without providing a record or opening brief that complies with the Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure (\"FRBP\");\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   2. Whether the bankruptcy court erred in denying Greenstein's Set Aside Motion; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   3. Whether the bankruptcy court erred in granting Wells Fargo, the Duran Defendants, Wolvek, and Nagata's Motion to Dismiss Greenstein's FAAC in her third adversary proceeding.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. STANDARDS OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   The Court has jurisdiction pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20158\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 158\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Greenstein fails to provide the standard of review in violation of FRBP 8014(a)(5).

Indeed, appellate courts routinely dismiss, or summarily affirm, appeals where the appellant fails to comply with procedural requirements.\n   <em>\n    Sekiya v.

(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF Nos. 7, 9, 19 (\"Greenstein must comply with the proper procedures, and cannot continue to disregard the Local Rules.\"); 23.) The Court encouraged her to retain counsel, and directly cited to, and quoted from, the rules governing the requirements for, and formatting of, Greenstein's Opening Brief. (ECF No. 23.) Despite this, she failed to serve an appendix of evidence with her Opening Brief. (\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1469662\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/689/877/#p879\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ) The Court provided her additional time to do so. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Even then, she 1) did not include the dockets from her bankruptcy or the adversary proceeding; 2) did not include all of the documents identified by appellees; and 3) omits several documents she purports to rely on in her Opening Brief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Greenstein's Opening Brief itself is equally deficient. As noted above, she did not provide a standard of review. (AOB 22.) She also regularly makes factual assertions that are not supported by citations to the record. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , AOB 16\n   (discussing allegations regarding foreclosure forbearance plan, and payments thereunder); 15 (discussing her alleged unlawful detainer action); 18 (discussing her assertion that Lipkis did not list the Property in his bankruptcy schedules); 32 (arguing that Lipkis's attorney \"admitted he signed the stipulation as a favor to a colleague, and apparently without his clients' knowledge...\"). Her legal citations often include nothing more than a case name, and sometimes a date. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , AOB 32.) Ultimately, the Court acknowledges the harshness of declining to address the merits of an appellant's brief because of procedural deficiencies, and thus turns to the merits of Greenstein's appeal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sekiya\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6046718\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/508/1198/#p1200\">\n    508 F.3d at 1200\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Greenstein's Set Aside Motion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Greenstein's Set Aside Motion argued that the In Rem Order was invalid at the time the bankruptcy court issued it in the Lipkis Action, and therefore the automatic stay in her Chapter 7 case precluded sale of the Property. (AOB 24.)

The bankruptcy court concluded that Greenstein was likely entitled to notice of the In Rem Order in the Lipkis Action, but that she was provided procedural due process because she knew of the In Rem Order prior to the sale of the Property, but did nothing.

Here, Wells Fargo recorded the In Rem Order, in accordance with state law, on March 28, 2012. (AA vol. I, 388.) The foreclosure trustee then issued a new notice of sale on May 14, 2012, with a sale date scheduled for June 4, 2012. (AA vol. I, 115.) Greenstein filed for bankruptcy on May 31, 2012, and on the same day the foreclosure trustee advised her of the In Rem Order, and explained that the automatic stay did not protect the Property as a result. (AA vol. I, 169-70; SA vol. IV, 850-51.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   The next day, Wells Fargo's counsel provided Greenstein with a copy of the In Rem Order, and continued the foreclosure sale for almost six weeks to provide her an opportunity to act accordingly.

II, 388-94). Despite these very clear warnings, Greenstein did not seek relief until after the foreclosure sale, when she filed a motion in the Lipkis Action on August 7, 2012 (more than three weeks after the sale). (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AA vol. I, 144-47.) The judge in the Lipkis Action denied Greenstein's request, in addition to two subsequent motions filed by Greenstein.

(AA vol. II, 371; SA vol. III, 678.) At that point, she was also represented by counsel. (AA vol. II, 371.) Ultimately, the Court finds that Greenstein was provided sufficient due process because she had six weeks to challenge the In Rem Order before the foreclosure sale, but she failed to exercise her right to do so.\n   <em>\n    c.f.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hudson v.

(AA vol. I, 18.) However, as reasoned by the court below and explained in detail above, the In Rem Order was a valid, final order of the court in the Lipkis Action. It allowed Wells Fargo to recover the Property, and excluded it from any subsequent bankruptcy stays pursuant to section 362(d)(4).

(SA vol. III, 714-44.) It named Wells Fargo, Marisol Nagata, and Steven Wolvek as defendants, among others. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) In any event, the allegations in the Second Civil Action complaint surround the same nucleus of facts that form the basis of her FAAC: 1) she claimed she suffered harm because Wells Fargo improperly foreclosed on her home; 2) she claimed the Lipkis Deed was a forgery that the defendants fraudulently used to assist in foreclosing on her home; and 3) she requested damages and equitable relief resulting from application of the In Rem Order and sale of her home.

Despite the addition of a few new defendants in her FAAC, including attorneys and other agents of Wells Fargo, the allegations remain the same-that her rights were violated by way of application of the In Rem Order, and subsequent foreclosure of her home. To the extent that these claims were not brought in the Second Civil Action, they certainly could have been, as they were based on the same facts.\n   <em>\n    Citizens for Open Gov't\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6054220\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-app-4th/205/296/#p324\">\n    205 Cal.

(SA vol. III, 714-49.) The court dismissed these claims without leave to amend. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) For the same reasons discussed above, this foreclosed Greenstein's claims against the same defendants surrounding the same conduct, in a successive suit.\n   <em>\n    Citizens for Open Gov't\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6054220\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-app-4th/205/296/#p324\">\n    205 Cal.

I, 193.) Greenstein only mentioned the Duran Defendants twice in the FAAC, and only in reference to them purchasing the property from Wells Fargo years after the Property was sold at foreclosure. (AA vol. II, 288, 338.) This was not enough to sustain a claim against them. The Bankruptcy Court liberally construed these allegations as supporting Greenstein's claim for quiet title. However, as discussed above, Greenstein's attempts to invalidate the sale of the Property are not legally sound, and therefore she could not maintain such an action against the Duran Defendants for quiet title because she did not have a valid claim of title.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%20761.020\">\n    Cal.
