BIANCO, United States District Judge\n   Samuel Osuji (\"appellant\") appeals from a May 9, 2017 Order entered by the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Eastern District of New York (the \"Bankruptcy Court\") granting a motion by Deutsche Bank National Trust Company (\"Deutsche Bank\") as trustee for Indymac INDX Mortgage Loan Trust 2007-AR1, Mortgage Pass-Through Certificates Series 2007-AR1 (\"Indymac\"). In its motion (the \"Stay Relief Motion\"), Deutsche Bank requested that the Bankruptcy Court terminate the automatic stay as it applied to one of the properties appellant listed in his bankruptcy schedules. The Bankruptcy Court issued the Order on appeal (the \"Stay Relief Order\") terminating the stay for cause, and specified that the stay was terminated as to Deutsche Bank, its agents, assigns, or successors in interest, so that they could \"take any and all action under applicable state law to exercise their remedies against the Property.\" (ECF No. 1 at 9.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   On September 1, 2017, Deutsche Bank (as trustee for Indymac, and collectively, \"appellees\") responded to this appeal, arguing that the Bankruptcy Court properly entered the Stay Relief Order \"as there was a lack of adequate protection, lack of equity, there was no reorganization as this was a Chapter 7 case, and the Court had already decided to abstain from litigation relating to Deutsche Bank's standing to enforce the Note and Mortgage.\" (ECF No. 8 at 1.) As set forth below, after a\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   review, the Court finds the instant appeal to be without merit and affirms the Bankruptcy Court's Stay Relief Order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I. BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The Court assumes the parties' familiarity with the full facts and procedural history of this action and summarizes the facts and history relevant to the instant appeal based on the record in the underlying Bankruptcy Court proceeding, the related adversary proceeding, and the instant appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   A. The Underlying Chapter 7 Bankruptcy\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Appellant filed a voluntary petition for relief under chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code on December 30, 2015. In his chapter 7 case, appellant filed bankruptcy schedules listing five properties that he claimed to own, including the property at issue in the instant appeal, located at 113 Lawrence Street, Uniondale, New York 11553 (the \"Lawrence Street Property\" or the \"Property\"). Affidavit,\n   <em>\n    In re\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Osuji\n   </em>\n   , No. 15-75534-ast (Bankr. E.D.N.Y. Jan. 13, 2016),\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   ECF No. 9 at 2-4. Appellant listed the Property as valued at $189,000.00 and indicated that he intended to retain it, claiming\n   a 100 percent exemption of the fair market value.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , ECF No. 9 at 4, 13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On October 27, 2016, the trustee in the bankruptcy proceeding filed a status report to inform the Bankruptcy Court of his intention \"to pursue or not pursue\" any interest of the estate in the five properties appellant claimed to own.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , ECF No. 40. The trustee stated only his intention \"to administer the Estate's interest in one of the subject properties,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 1; he did not state an interest in administering the Lawrence Street Property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   B. Appellees' Stay Relief Motion\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On March 15, 2017, appellees filed the Stay Relief Motion, requesting that the Bankruptcy Court grant relief from the automatic stay with respect to the Lawrence Street Property.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , ECF No. 70. Appellees requested relief \"so that the New York Supreme Court may hear the Foreclosure Action\" involving this Property,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   , ECF No. 69 at 7, and thereby enable Deutsche Bank to \"exercise its rights and remedies with respect to the Property under applicable state law,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In support of their motion, appellees explained that Deutsche Bank was the holder of the Note and assignee of the Mortgage on this Property.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2. Appellees stated that the previous owner of the Property had stopped paying his monthly mortgage payments and was, therefore, in default on the loan he had taken to purchase the Property (which was secured by the Note and Mortgage assigned to Deutsche Bank).\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   On December 30, 2009 (following the default on the April 1, 2009 mortgage payment, and all payments thereafter), a foreclosure action was commenced to close on the Property.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2-3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   As stated\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , appellant also claimed to own this Property, and filed a state court action in 2012 seeking a judgment awarding him legal title to the Property.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3. Appellant thereafter filed his bankruptcy petition on December 30, 2015. Appellees explained in their Stay Relief Motion that \"[although] Debtor is not a party to the Note and Mortgage and his claimed interest in the Property remains unrecorded in the land records, Deutsche Bank stayed the Foreclosure Action upon notice of Debtor's claim of ownership in the Property and his bankruptcy filing.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In support of their Stay Relief Motion, appellees also summarized the procedural history of appellant's adversary proceeding relating to the Property: On March 30, 2016, appellant brought an adversary proceeding against Indymac Bank, F.S.B.,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   alleging that Indymac was not, in fact, the holder of the Note and Mortgage encumbering the Lawrence Street Property.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5; Adversary Complaint,\n   <em>\n    Osuji v. Indymac Bank F.S.B.\n   </em>\n   , No. 16-8045-ast (Bankr. E.D.N.Y. Mar. 30, 2016),\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   ECF No. 1 at 1-2. On February 2, 2017, the Bankruptcy Court issued an Order abstaining from the\n   adversary proceeding (the \"Abstention Order\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , ECF No. 29 at 15-16. The Bankruptcy Court explained that \"permissive abstention [wa]s warranted because state law issues predominate over this adversary proceeding.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Following this Order, appellees filed their Stay Relief Motion, noting that \"[t]he Abstention Order unequivocally states that the state law issues relating to the Property should be addressed by the New York Supreme Court,\" and that this was not possible in light of the automatic stay that resulted, pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20362\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 362\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , when appellant filed for bankruptcy in federal court.\n   <em>\n    In re Osuji\n   </em>\n   , ECF No. 69 at 7. As stated\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , appellees requested that the Bankruptcy Court grant relief from the automatic stay so that they could pursue the foreclosure action in state court. (ECF No. 1 at 7.) Appellees attached a copy of the Note, Mortgage, and Assignment of Mortgage to the affirmation filed in support of their motion.\n   <em>\n    In re Osuji\n   </em>\n   , ECF Nos. 69-2, 69-3, 69-5. Appellant opposed, asserting that Deutsche Bank was not the holder of the Note and Mortgage, had not submitted any evidence demonstrating how it became the holder of the Note, and did not have standing to seek relief from the automatic stay.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , ECF No. 77 at 2. The Bankruptcy Court held a hearing on the motion, during which appellees' counsel stated that he had the original Note in his possession in court that day. (ECF No. 1 at 4.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   C. The Stay Relief Order\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On May 9, 2017, the Bankruptcy Court issued its Stay Relief Order, stating that \"[b]ased on the entire record before the Court, Deutsche has successfully demonstrated for the purposes of this Motion that it is the holder of the Note endorsed in blank and has standing to seek relief from the automatic stay.\" (ECF No. 1 at 4.) The Bankruptcy Court determined that there was \"cause, including lack of adequate protection, under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20362\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 362\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(1),\" and terminated the stay as it applied to the Property. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9.) The Bankruptcy Court also specifically stated that the stay was terminated as to Deutsche Bank, its agents, assigns, or successors in interest, so that they could seek to exercise their remedies against the Property in state court. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The Bankruptcy Court stated that \"whether Deutsche can ultimately prevail in a state foreclosure action ... is for the state courts to determine.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In order to determine whether cause existed to lift the automatic stay \"to allow [the] stayed proceeding to continue in state court,\" the Bankruptcy Court considered twelve factors that the Second Circuit has established may guide courts deciding such cases (the \"\n   <em>\n    Sonnax\n   </em>\n   factors,\" discussed\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   ). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8.) The Bankruptcy Court concluded that these factors weighed in favor of granting relief from the automatic stay. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) In particular, the Bankruptcy Court determined that cause existed because the stay prevented the state court from adjudicating the parties' claims, and was thus \"inimical to the ability of the parties to receive a determination of who has what rights in the Property.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8-9.) The Bankruptcy Court also noted that neither the Note obligor nor Debtor had made payments on the Note in approximately eight years and, thus, \"[t]hese ongoing material defaults constitute\n   a lack of adequate protection.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   D. Appeal\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Appellant filed his notice of appeal of the Stay Relief Order on May 24, 2017. (ECF No. 1.) Appellant filed his brief on August 4, 2017. (ECF Nos. 6, 7.) Appellees filed their opposition on September 1, 2017. (ECF No. 8.) Appellant filed his reply on September 25, 2017. (ECF No. 11.)

Nonetheless, the Court has also considered the other\n   <em>\n    Sonnax\n   </em>\n   factors and concludes that they weigh in favor of terminating the stay. As appellees argue, lifting the stay to enable appellees to proceed with the state foreclosure action will resolve the issues relating to the Property. As recognized in this Court's January 26, 2018 Order affirming the Bankruptcy Court's Abstention Order, the state court has the expertise to address the foreclosure issues.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Osuji v.

The Court also recognizes that (1) lifting the stay and allowing the state foreclosure action to proceed furthers the interests of judicial economy, and (2) at this juncture, the balance of harms favors appellees (in light of appellant's failure to make mortgage payments and the increasing cost to appellees, among other reasons).\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Cicale\n   </em>\n   , No. 05-14462 (AJG),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2007%20WL%201893301\">\n    2007 WL 1893301\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4-5 (Bankr.

The Court finds that the Bankruptcy Court did not abuse its discretion when it granted appellees' motion, and, even under\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   review of the Bankruptcy Court's decision, cause existed to terminate the stay pursuant to Section 362(d)(1).\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   IV.

During this hearing, appellant expressed his frustration with being a defendant in this new adversary proceeding in federal court, in light of the fact that the plaintiffs in the proceeding-including Deutsche Bank as trustee for Indymac-had previously requested that the Bankruptcy Court abstain in favor of state court adjudication.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 50. The Bankruptcy Court pointed out in response that appellant's appeals of its abstention orders were still pending, and asked appellant to \"pick a side ... either [you] want the Court to abstain from State law issues ... or you want it all to be litigated here.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 50-51.

Thus, the Court has decided the appeal on the merits.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"8\">\n   <p id=\"p-65\">\n    These factors include: \"(1) whether relief would result in a partial or complete resolution of the issues; (2) lack of any connection with or interference with the bankruptcy case; (3) whether the other proceeding involves the debtor as a fiduciary; (4) whether a specialized tribunal with the necessary expertise has been established to hear the cause of action; (5) whether the debtor's insurer has assumed full responsibility for defending it; (6) whether the action primarily involves third parties; (7) whether litigation in another forum would prejudice the interests of other creditors; (8) whether the judgment claim arising from the other action is subject to equitable subordination; (9) whether movant's success in the other proceeding would result in a judicial lien avoidable by the debtor; (10) the interests of judicial economy and the expeditious and economical resolution of litigation; (11) whether the parties are ready for trial in the other proceeding; and (12) impact of the stay on the parties and the balance of harms.\"\n    <em>\n     In re Sonnax Indus.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10541492\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/907/1280/#p1286\">\n     907 F.2d at 1286\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"9\">\n   <p id=\"p-66\">\n    Appellant presents his standing argument as six separate issues, including whether the Bankruptcy Court erred in granting relief from the stay because (1) appellees were not a party in interest, (2) the Bankruptcy Court misappropriated evidence necessary to establish standing, (3) the Bankruptcy Court determined that the \"in blank\" Note tendered to the Bankruptcy Court constituted \"uncontroverted evidence,\" (4) the Bankruptcy Court overlooked the affidavit of the Vice President \"of the proper entity\" and Note endorsed \"in the name of the proper entity,\" (5) the Bankruptcy Court determined that the \"worksheet\" appellees submitted constituted the affidavit of the Vice President \"of the entity claiming to be the owner and holder of the Note, and necessary to authenticate negotiation and delivery of the note,\" and (6) the Bankruptcy Court determined that Deutsche Bank had presented uncontroverted affirmation that it was in possession of the original Note and was an assignee of the Mortgage. (ECF No. 6 at 7-8.) The Court discusses these standing arguments-all regarding the evidence the parties presented relating to the Note and assignment-together in this section.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"10\">\n   <p id=\"p-67\">\n    Appellant offers several theories that he believes are grounds for the Court to reject appellees' evidence as inadequate. Primarily, appellant claims that appellees are not a party in interest because appellees have not submitted a document by a party with firsthand knowledge of the transaction demonstrating the chain of transfer of the Note. (ECF No. 6 at 14;\n    <em>\n     see also\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n    at 20-21.) Appellant argues that appellees' attorney's affirmation has no probative value because he lacks personal knowledge of the facts. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 14.) Similarly, appellant argues that appellees failed to submit any affidavit or affirmation authenticating the assignment(s) of mortgage, or establishing a principal-agent relationship authorizing the series of transfers of the Note to Indymac and ultimately to Deutsche Bank. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 15-16.)\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-68\">\n    In support of his claim to ownership, appellant argues that the Mortgage and Note are endorsed in the name of another entity, \"as evidenced by the original Note submitted to the bankruptcy court, with an affidavit of the vice president of the owner and holder of the original Note.\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 18-19.) Appellant claims that Private Capital Management, LLC, is the holder of the Note and that he provided \"uncontroverted affidavit testimony of a party with firsthand knowledge that they are the holder of the Note, by virtue of possession of the original note executed with special endorsement ('Pay to the order of Private Capital Management, LLC').\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 19.) Appellant submitted this Note, dated January 5, 2007, as an exhibit. (ECF No. 7-6.) Appellant concludes that, as the Note was endorsed to Private Capital Management, LLC, Deutsche Bank had no interest and is barred from enforcing the interest of another entity in this Property. (ECF No. 6 at 20.)\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-69\">\n    In further support of his position that Private Capital Management, LLC, rather than Deutsche Bank, holds the Note, appellant provides affidavits from two expert witnesses, one an expert in \"mortgage loan search,\" and the other in \"areas related to the securitization of mortgage loans ... [and] loan origination and underwriting\" (among other listed areas of expertise). (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 22-23.) The first expert affidavit states that the expert's mortgage loan search reflected that the subject loan was placed in the Indymac Mortgage Loan Trust on or before February 27, 2007. (ECF No. 7-4 at 1-2.) The second expert declares in his affidavit that he worked with Indymac Bank on the transaction of this loan, and that,\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-70\">\n    The Servicer of the trust [in which the subject loan was placed] was Indymac Bank F[S]B, and the named Trustee was Deutsche Bank .... The only potential party to a foreclosure wherein the allege[d] financial injury and therefore a right to collect the obligation, enforce the note, or enforce the security instrument is either a party who has actually lost money or stands to lose money, or an authorized representative ... A loan Servicer would fit none of these descriptions.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-71\">\n    (ECF No. 7-5 at 2-3.) Finally, appellant argues that appellees did not submit \"regularly maintained records\" showing delivery of the Note along the chain of transfer (and ultimately to Deutsche Bank), or any other evidence of delivery and the fact that Deutsche Bank was in physical possession of the Note. (ECF No. 6 at 24-25.)\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-72\">\n    The Court has considered these arguments along with appellant's exhibits. None of these arguments alters the Court's conclusion that appellees provided the requisite proof to establish standing to seek relief from the automatic stay.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"11\">\n   <p id=\"p-73\">\n    Even without that statement by appellant, the result would be the same under the\n    <em>\n     Sonnax\n    </em>\n    factors.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"12\">\n   <p id=\"p-74\">\n    The Bankruptcy Court's Stay Relief Order states explicitly that the Bankruptcy Court granted appellees' motion \"for cause ... under\n    <extracted-citation index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20362\">\n     11 U.S.C. \u00a7 362\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (d)(1)\" (ECF No. 1 at 4), and includes an analysis to determine if cause exists under this section (\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n    at 5-7). Although appellees also argue that stay relief should be granted under Section 362(d)(2), the Bankruptcy Court did not undertake such an analysis with respect to Section 362(d)(2) or express that its decision relied on this section. In light of the Court's conclusion that the Bankruptcy Court did not abuse its discretion in granting relief from the stay pursuant to Section 362(d)(1), the Court need not examine whether it would have been proper to grant relief under Section 362(d)(2).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
