Samson, United States Bankruptcy Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   This matter is before the Court on the Motion for Summary Judgment (Adv. Dkt. No. 7)\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   by Plaintiff Kappa Development and General Contracting Inc. (\"Kappa\") and the Cross-Motion for Summary Judgment (Adv. Dkt. No. 10) by Defendant and Counterclaimant Hanover Insurance Company (\"Hanover\"). Kappa is the Debtor-in-Possession in the underlying chapter 11 case, and Hanover is the surety that bonded a construction project Kappa undertook\n   before filing bankruptcy (\"Camp Shelby Project\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The parties dispute the ownership of $67,516.06 (\"Contract Funds\" or \"Funds\")\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   that the federal government paid Kappa prepetition in connection with the Camp Shelby Project. Hanover asserts its entitlement to the Funds by right of subrogation for its payment on Kappa's behalf to one of the material suppliers on the Camp Shelby Project. (Resp. to Mot. for S.J. &amp; Cross-Mot. for S.J., \u00b6\u00b6 2, 4, Adv. Dkt. No. 10 at 1,2.) On this basis, Hanover seeks a judgment declaring that the Contract Funds \"are not property of the Debtor's estate but belong to Hanover\" and directing Kappa to pay the Funds to Hanover. (Countercl. \u00b6 11 &amp; Prayer for Relief, Adv. Dkt. No. 9 at 5.) Kappa asserts that the Contract Funds are property of the bankruptcy estate \"not subject to subrogation claims of Hanover\" and seeks an order authorizing it to use the Contract Funds for day-to-day operations. (Compl. Prayer for Relief \u00b6\u00b6 2, 4, Adv. Dkt. No. 1 at 3-4.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Kappa is correct that the Contract Funds are property of the bankruptcy estate, but the questions of whether the Funds are subject to any rights of Hanover and whether Kappa may use the funds are not ripe for resolution pending hearing on a Motion to Prohibit Use of Cash Collateral filed by another creditor (Case Dkt. No. 65). Summary judgment is therefore granted on Kappa's Motion on the question of ownership of the Funds, but denied on the questions of Hanover's rights in the Funds and whether Kappa may use the Funds. Summary judgment is denied on Hanover's Cross-Motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    UNDISPUTED FACTS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On October 22, 2013, Hanover issued performance and payment bonds as surety for Kappa on the Camp Shelby Project. (Aff. of Diane P. Pontillo \u00b6 3 &amp; Exs. A-1, A-2, Ex. 1 to Resp. to Mot. for S.J. &amp; Cross-Mot. for S.J., Adv. Dkt. No. 10-1 at 1, 4-9.) Hanover paid a $65,570.66 claim by Mississippi Utilities Supply d/b/a Ferguson Enterprises (\"MUS\") on the payment bond and incurred attorney's fees and expenses of more than $5,000 in connection with issuing the bonds. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 4, 8.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Kappa filed a case under chapter 11 on June 12, 2017. (Case Dkt. No. 1.) On the date of the filing, the Contract Funds were in the trust account of the attorney who represented Kappa on contractual matters. (Aff. of Russell S. Gill \u00b6\u00b6 2, 7, 11, Ex. 1 to Mot. for S.J., Adv. Dkt. No. 7 at 6-7.) The Funds had been in that account for two months, the attorney having deposited them with Hanover's permission after Kappa brought the attorney the check from the government for the Camp Shelby Project in early April. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 7; Answer \u00b6 8, Adv. Dkt. No. 9 at 2.) No escrow agreement was signed. (Compl. \u00b6 9; Answer \u00b6 9.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Upon written demand by Kappa's bankruptcy attorney after the filing of the bankruptcy case, the attorney for Kappa's contractual matters transferred the Funds to the bankruptcy attorney, who deposited the Funds in his trust account. (Aff. of Nicholas Van Wiser, Ex. 2 to Mot. for S.J., Adv. Dkt. No. 7 at 8.) Later, an order was entered requiring the Funds to be placed in a restricted-access Debtor-in-Possession account.

Hanover asserts that\n   <em>\n    Pearlman\n   </em>\n   is still good law, relying on it and its progeny to argue that the Funds are not property of the estate. (Resp. Opposing Mot. for S.J. &amp; Cross-Mot. for S.J. \u00b6\u00b6 5-14, Adv. Dkt. No. 10 at 2-7.) Kappa argues that because the Bankruptcy Code expanded the definition of \"property of the estate,\"\n   <em>\n    Pearlman\n   </em>\n   is no longer precedential. (Mot. for S.J. \u00b6 15, Adv. Dkt. No. 7 at 3-4.) This Court takes no position on\n   <em>\n    Pearlman\n   </em>\n   's continuing vitality, because under the present facts,\n   <em>\n    Pearlman\n   </em>\n   does not conflict with the conclusion that the Funds are property of the estate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Kappa's Prepetition Possessory Interest in the Funds.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Property of the estate is determined by an interplay between state law and bankruptcy law. Under the Bankruptcy Code, the filing of a bankruptcy case\n   creates an estate that includes \"all legal or equitable interests of the debtor in property as of the commencement of the case.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20541\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 541\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1).

Upon deposit of the check into the first attorney trust account and after the proceeds were transferred to the second attorney trust account, Kappa maintained its interest in the Funds.
