During the pendency of Horlbeck's case, Tillman Enterprises, LLC (\"Tillman\") filed a three-count adversary complaint seeking a determination that a debt Horlbeck owes to Tillman is not dischargeable pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20523\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 523\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(19), (a)(2)(A), and (a)(2)(B) (Counts I, II, and III, respectively).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The matter is now before the Court for ruling on the parties' cross-motions for summary judgment. For the reasons set forth below, the motions are granted in part and denied in part. Horlbeck is entitled to summary judgment on Count I under \u00a7 523(a)(19), and Tillman is entitled to summary judgment on Counts II and III under \u00a7\u00a7 523(a)(2)(A) and (a)(2)(B).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    JURISDICTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The Court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201334\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1334\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and Internal Operating Procedure 15(a) of the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois. This is a core proceeding under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20157\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 157\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(2)(I).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   A careful review of the pleadings and motions, as well as the statements and exhibits attached thereto, reveals that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact. Not surprisingly, Horlbeck and Tillman tell different versions of the same story, but the material facts are the same. At its heart, this case involves a hedge fund manager, a wealthy family, the investment of over $3,000,000, and the loss of much of that investment between 2007 and 2008.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Todd Horlbeck, the debtor in the underlying bankruptcy case, managed a hedge\n   fund from its inception in 2002 to its liquidation in 2009. During those years, seven members of the Tillman family (collectively, the \"Tillman Family\") invested their money through the hedge fund, either in an individual capacity or through a legal entity.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Upon liquidation of the hedge fund, the members of the Tillman Family received only a fraction of their total investment. As a result, they investigated Horlbeck and learned that the quarterly statements that he supplied to investors had been inaccurate. Horlbeck maintains that most of the inaccurate values reported in the statements were the result of miscalculations. He admits, however, that he began to knowingly report inflated account values after January 9, 2008. Eventually, Horlbeck agreed to pay the Tillman Family $1,265,000 in exchange for the release of potential claims against him. Despite that agreement, he failed to pay the Tillman Family and subsequently filed bankruptcy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The Horlbeck-Tillman Investment Relationship\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Horlbeck first met a member of the Tillman Family when he approached Warner Tillman at his place of business in 1992. (Adv. No. 16-00026, Dkt. No. 106-2 at 3.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   ) Soon thereafter, Warner began to use Horlbeck as an investment advisor. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) In 2002, after a decade of managing investments for Warner, Horlbeck established a hedge fund called HCM L.P. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The hedge fund was structured as a limited partnership of which Horlbeck Capital Management LLC was the general partner, and investors were limited partners. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Todd Horlbeck served as the manager of Horlbeck Capital Management LLC, which in turn served as the manager of HCM L.P. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Between 2003 and 2008, the Tillman Family invested a total of $3,120,000 through HCM L.P. on eleven separate occasions, on the dates and in the amounts set forth in the following table:\n  </p>\n  <pre id=\"p-19\"><strong>Account Holder</strong> <strong>Date</strong> <strong>Amount</strong> Tillman Enterprises, LLC 12/24/2002 $1,000,000 Josh Tillman 01/02/2003 $250,000 Burton Tillman 12/24/2003 $200,000 Warner Tillman Trust 01/02/2004 $200,000 Warner Tillman Trust 09/29/2006 $500,000 Joel Tillman 01/15/2007 $60,000 Julie Tillman 01/18/2007 $60,000 Julie Tillman 04/01/2007 $100,000 Joel Tillman 04/30/2007 $100,000 Sam and Jenny Wiley 06/30/2007 $50,000 Estate of Burton Tillman 01/03/2008 $600,000 <strong>Total</strong> <strong>$3,120,000</strong></pre>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   (Adv. Dkt. 85-37 at 2-3, Exs. 2A-2G.) The investments were memorialized by subscription agreements that contained anti-reliance clauses. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Under those clauses, the members of the Tillman Family represented that, in making the decision to invest,\n   they relied solely upon a private placement memorandum and its ancillary documents and materials, along with their own investigations. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Further, they acknowledged that no representations outside of the memorandum and partnership agreement had been made. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    B. The False Account Statements and HCM L.P.'s Collapse\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Throughout the life of HCM L.P., Horlbeck sent quarterly statements to investors that reflected the number of shares owned, the net asset value per share,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   and the total value of each account. (Adv. Dkt. 107-1 at 6.) At some point, Horlbeck decided not to disclose the actual 2007 year-end values to investors. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) He made that decision \"in an effort to make the fund's performance appear better than it was.\" (Adv. Dkt. 106-2 at 15.) Specifically, Horlbeck admits that after January 7, 2008, he began to knowingly overstate account values, starting with the statement for the fourth quarter of 2007 and continuing with each statement issued through the end of 2008. (Adv. Dkt. 107-1 at 8.) Horlbeck says that he learned in May or June of 2009 that the values in the statements had also been inaccurate for the first three quarters of 2007. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) In fact, the values in the statements had been inaccurate since the inception of the hedge fund. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Adv. Dkt. 106-2 at 14-15.) After Horlbeck issued the last account statement in January 2009, he wrote letters to investors to advise them that HCM L.P. would be closing in April 2009. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10-11.) Subsequently, Horlbeck liquidated HCM L.P., and then he returned $554,162.42 to Tillman and the Warner Tillman Trust, $1,145,837.58 less than the $1,700,000 that they invested. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11.) No evidence was offered of losses incurred by other members of the Tillman Family.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Investigations and Settlements\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   After HCM L.P.'s liquidation, several parties launched parallel investigations into Horlbeck's management of the hedge fund. Among them, the Financial Regulatory Authority, Inc. (\"FINRA\"),\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   a securities industry regulator, sent both requests for information and investigative questions to Horlbeck and also conducted an on-the-record interview with him. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11-31.) Eventually, Horlbeck executed a letter of acceptance, waiver, and consent with FINRA (the \"AWC Agreement\"), agreeing to a permanent bar from the securities industry. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 31.) The Tillman Family initially engaged in direct correspondence with Horlbeck but eventually hired an attorney to formally investigate and negotiate a settlement. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 26-31.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   On May 19, 2009, soon after Horlbeck had liquidated the hedge fund, he wrote a letter to Warner Tillman. The letter informed Warner that there had been \"performance and reporting inaccuracies\" in the quarterly statements but that \"these inaccuracies ha[d] not altered the overall results ... or the amount of [Warner's] final distribution.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 19-20.) Around the same time, FINRA sent Horlbeck a list of investigative questions about his management of the hedge fund. (Adv. Dkt. 111-1 at 13-14.) On July 9, 2009, Horlbeck responded to FINRA by admitting that \"in an effort to make the fund's performance appear better than it was, [he] reported to partners a valuation that was not accurate .... [He] reported to partners a valuation\n   that was better than the actual valuation.\" (Adv. Dkt. 107-1 at 16, Ex. M.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Less than two months later, on August 28, 2009, Horlbeck sent letters to several of the hedge fund's investors, including members of the Tillman Family. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9.) In those letters, Horlbeck claimed that he \"had discovered errors with the [n]et [a]sset [v]alue of ... HCM L.P.,\" that \"some partners were inadvertently overpaid ... approximately $464,988,\" and that members of the Tillman Family were owed additional amounts due to the overpayments. (Adv. Dkt. 85-37 at 6, Ex. 11.) The letters did not disclose that Horlbeck was subject to an investigation by FINRA. Instead, Horlbeck self-servingly quoted his own letter to FINRA about compensation stating: \"I did not take all the performance based compensation to which I was entitled, and I left virtually all of my investment in the fund throughout its existence ....\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) In the August 2009 letters, Horlbeck offered to sign promissory notes for repayment of the additional amounts owed in exchange for releases of claims against him. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   After the members of the Tillman Family received the letters, they hired an attorney to investigate Horlbeck and negotiate a settlement. (Adv. Dkt. 106-2 at 26-31.) Throughout the negotiations, Horlbeck continued to seek the release of claims against him. In a November 10, 2009 letter to investors, Horlbeck wrote, \"I have received most of the settlements and releases back.\" (Adv. Dkt. 85-37 at 7, Ex. 12.) For investors who had not already settled, Horlbeck enclosed photocopies of checks that would be sent upon the receipt of signed releases. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The checks were not for the full amounts that Horlbeck claimed to owe, so he again offered to send promissory notes for repayment of the remaining amounts. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Later, in a November 20, 2009 email to Warner, Horlbeck again sought release and threatened that his \"other option [was] simply to file for bankruptcy protection ... but [that he was] reluctant to do it.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , Ex. 13.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   All the while, Horlbeck downplayed the existence and intensity of FINRA's ongoing investigation and discouraged Tillman from learning more about it. In a February 1, 2010 email, Horlbeck informed Warner Tillman that FINRA would probably call to discuss a letter that Warner had sent to him. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9, Ex. 20.) Horlbeck told Warner, \"You are free to discuss anything, of course, but [FINRA's] goals are quite a bit different from what yours might be, and therefore discussing less, or nothing, rather might be the safest course of action.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Subsequently, on March 10, 2010, Horlbeck emailed Warner to say, among other things, that he had retained an attorney for his \"dealings\" with FINRA. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9, Ex. 21.) Finally, in a July 2, 2010 email, Horlbeck went so far as to stress that Tillman should go to FINRA only as \"a last resort.\" (Adv. Dkt. 111-1 at 27.) In that email, Horlbeck also stated that there was a strong interest the Tillman Family not contacting FINRA, warning that such involvement would end his career. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The parties eventually reached a settlement (the \"Settlement Agreement\") whereby Horlbeck would be released from any and all claims arising from the Tillman Family's investments and the management of the hedge fund in exchange for a cash payment of $22,500 and a promissory note (the \"Promissory Note\") to pay $1,242,500 over twenty years to Tillman on behalf of the Tillman Family. (Adv. Dkt. 38 at 8-10; Adv. Dkt. 106-2 at 28-29.) The Settlement Agreement required Horlbeck to provide various documents, including a financial affidavit (the \"Financial Affidavit\") that disclosed assets and liabilities. (Adv. Dkt. 106-2 at 29.) The Agreement also included a provision that would postpone payments\n   under the Promissory Note if Horlbeck was suspended by FINRA from transacting business. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Adv. Dkt. 82 at 9, Ex. S.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The Tillman Family signed the Settlement Agreement on September 27, 2010 but did not immediately send it to Horlbeck. Instead, their attorney sent Horlbeck's attorney an email listing several items, including the Financial Affidavit, that needed to be completed and returned before the Settlement Agreement could be finalized. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , Ex. R.) Soon thereafter, on October 14, 2010, the Tillman Family's attorney emailed Horlbeck's attorney a copy of the signed Settlement Agreement with an instruction \"to hold [the agreement] in escrow subject to our receipt and approval of the documents from your client.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   Ex. S.) Horlbeck ultimately signed the Financial Affidavit, dated October 14, 2010, which disclosed information about the income, expenses, assets, and liabilities of both Horlbeck and his wife. (Adv. Dkt. 106-2 at 29.) Specifically, the Financial Affidavit disclosed $550,000 in annual income, two notes payable to banks, and no contingent liabilities. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Adv. Dkt. 82 at 10, Ex. U.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Unbeknownst to Tillman, FINRA's investigation had been escalating during the settlement negotiations. In the fall and winter of 2009, while Horlbeck was actively pursuing releases from investors, he was also producing documents and answering investigative questions in response to inquiries sent by FINRA. In November 2010, a month after the execution of the Financial Affidavit, FINRA conducted an on-the-record interview of Horlbeck. During that interview, Horlbeck admitted, among other things, that he had been paying investors under promissory notes. (Adv. Dkt. 107-1 at 20, Ex. X.) Subsequently, on May 17, 2011, several months after the parties had finalized the Settlement Agreement, FINRA advised Horlbeck of its preliminary determination to recommend disciplinary action against him. (Adv. Dkt. 85-37 at 9-10.) Eventually, on December 13, 2011, Horlbeck and FINRA entered into the AWC Agreement. (Adv. Dkt. 106-2 at 31.) In that Agreement, FINRA determined and Horlbeck accepted that he had violated the regulator's rules by understating losses on account statements sent to investors. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) As a result, Horlbeck agreed to an indefinite bar from association with any FINRA member, thereby limiting his ability to work in the securities investment industry. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Breach of the Promissory Note and Filing of Horlbeck's Bankruptcy\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   In October 2013, Tillman filed suit against Horlbeck in state court for breach of the Promissory Note. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The state court dismissed the case without prejudice after Horlbeck filed a chapter 7 bankruptcy petition on August 21, 2015. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Schedule F of Horlbeck's bankruptcy petition lists, among other debts, approximately $1.3 million owed to \"several of the Fund's investors who had never signed an agreement releasing [him].\" (Adv. Dkt. 85-37 at 10; Bankr. Dkt. 12 at 9-12.) Horlbeck indicated that the debts were for promissory notes executed between 2008 and 2010, in amounts ranging from $7,093.60 to $550,000. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Subsequently, Tillman filed an adversary complaint seeking a determination that the debt Horlbeck owes under the Settlement Agreement and Promissory Note is not dischargeable. Tillman then amended the original complaint after Horlbeck filed an initial motion to dismiss. In response, Horlbeck filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint that was denied by Judge Cassling, who was then presiding over the case. After engaging in discovery, the parties filed the cross-motions\n   for summary judgment that are now before the Court for ruling.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    SUMMARY JUDGMENT\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Summary judgment is appropriate when there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.

Ill. Jan. 30, 2018) (summarily overruling the defendant's evidentiary objections because the \"plaintiff [was] likely to be able to cure [the] problems at trial\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Horlbeck's Evidentiary Objections\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Before discussing the merits of the parties' arguments, the Court first addresses the evidentiary objections raised by Horlbeck. Specifically, Horlbeck objects to twenty-seven of the forty-two paragraphs in Tillman's statement of facts, often for more than one reason per paragraph. (Adv. Dkt. 109 at 3.) According to Horlbeck, sixteen paragraphs do not accurately reflect the evidence cited; eighteen paragraphs contain conclusory statements; ten paragraphs cite materials containing hearsay; and several paragraphs are irrelevant and cite to evidence lacking foundation. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3-21.) In addition, Horlbeck objects on similar grounds to several paragraphs in Tillman's statement of additional facts. (Adv. Dkt. 111-1.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Many of Horlbeck's objections are inconsequential because they relate to immaterial allegations. For example, Horlbeck devotes almost three pages to the argument that the materials cited do not support the allegations that Warner Tillman invested money on behalf of his family members and that he was the primary contact with Horlbeck. (Adv. Dkt. 106-2 at 4-7.) Regardless of whether those allegations are supported by the evidence, they are immaterial because they are unrelated to the elements of the claims at issue. Any lack of evidentiary support is therefore irrelevant because a dispute about an immaterial allegation does not preclude summary judgment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Anderson\n   </em>\n   , 477 U.S. at 248,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6206897\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/477/242/#p248\">\n    106 S.Ct. 2505\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Horlbeck's other evidentiary objections are without merit for a number of reasons. First, many of the exhibits to which Horlbeck objects are also offered as materials in support of Horlbeck's own motion for summary judgment. Furthermore, several of Tillman's statements do accurately reflect the evidence cited, making Horlbeck's argument to the contrary erroneous. For example, Horlbeck objects to Tillman's statement that all of the members of the Tillman Family received similar letters dated August 28, 2009 because he claims that the exhibit cited does not contain copies of the letters. (Adv. Dkt. 106-2 at 21.) A review of Exhibit M to Tillman's motion reveals that Horlbeck's objection is unfounded-copies of all of the letters are included. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Adv. Dkt. 82, Ex. M.) Many other statements objected to for lacking evidentiary support or being conclusory in nature were admitted to by Horlbeck elsewhere in the record. The remaining objections, that materials cited are inadmissible for reasons such as hearsay, irrelevance, and lack of foundation, are overruled because they are either without merit or the Court is satisfied that the content of those materials could be presented in an admissible form at trial.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Tillman seeks a summary judgment determination that the debt owed under the Settlement Agreement and Promissory Note is not dischargeable pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 523(a)(19) and (a)(2)(B). Horlbeck, in turn, moves for summary judgment on the basis that Tillman cannot prove the elements of \u00a7\u00a7 523(a)(19), (a)(2)(A), and (a)(2)(B). Thus, although Tillman has not sought a determination under \u00a7 523(a)(2)(A), Horlbeck has, so all three statutory exceptions to discharge will be addressed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   To prevail, Tillman must prove that each element of \u00a7\u00a7 523(a)(19) and (a)(2)(B) is satisfied by a preponderance of the evidence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Grogan v.

For example, in the July 9, 2009 response to FINRA, Horlbeck stated that he reported inflated values \"in an effort to make the fund's performance appear better than it was[.]\" By saying that he reported the figures \"in an effort\" to alter the appearance of the fund's performance, Horlbeck provided the reason for his actions. In doing so, he admitted that he made the conscious decision to report inflated values. In contrast, in the August 28, 2009 letter, Horlbeck told Tillman that he \"had discovered errors with the [net] [a]sset [v]alue of the [hedge fund].\" In that letter, Horlbeck used the word \"discovered\" rather than language to indicate that it was his intentional choice to report overstated values-something that he had previously admitted\n   to FINRA. In fact, the letter to Tillman failed to disclose an investigation by FINRA and mentioned the regulatory agency only once, in the context of reporting compensation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   In correspondence after August 2009, Horlbeck alluded to the FINRA investigation only by referring to his \"regulator\" and mentioning \"dealings with FINRA.\" Horlbeck also stressed the importance of Tillman going to FINRA only as \"a last resort\" because doing so could affect Horlbeck's livelihood and thus his ability to repay Tillman. In the July 2, 2010 email to Tillman, Horlbeck expressly discussed the potential consequences if FINRA got involved, warning that Tillman should not go to FINRA because such involvement could mean the end of his career.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   Meanwhile, FINRA had been escalating its investigation. In fall and winter 2009, Horlbeck produced documents and answered investigative questions in response to requests sent by FINRA. Later, in November 2010, Horlbeck appeared for an on-the-record examination with FINRA. Subsequently, on May 17, 2011, FINRA advised Horlbeck of its preliminary determination to recommend disciplinary action against him. Almost seven months later, on December 13, 2011, Horlbeck and FINRA entered into the AWC Agreement under which Horlbeck consented to a permanent bar from association with FINRA, thereby limiting his ability to work in the securities industry.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   Horlbeck's statements to Tillman about his management of the fund were false and misleading. To say that he \"discovered\" reporting inaccuracies mischaracterizes his conduct in light of the earlier admission that he overstated account values \"in an effort to make the fund's performance appear better than it was.\" Likewise, in his letters attributing losses to inadvertent overpayments and miscalculations, Horlbeck mischaracterizes his conduct by failing to acknowledge that he intentionally reported inflated account values. All of those statements were false representations. Furthermore, Horlbeck failed to inform Tillman about material details of the FINRA investigation throughout the course of their settlement negotiations. The withholding of those details created a false impression that FINRA was not actively investigating Horlbeck and that he would be able to continue associating with the regulatory agency for the indefinite future. Had Horlbeck disclosed to Tillman any details about the investigation, or even its existence, that disclosure would have corrected the false impression that there was no issue with FINRA. Horlbeck's entire deceitful course of conduct-from maintaining that he had merely discovered inaccuracies to withholding information about the existence and intensity of the FINRA investigation-involved false representations, omissions, and impressions.

N.D. Ill. 1995).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   The different stories that Tillman and FINRA each heard from Horlbeck are particularly relevant to the issue of intent here. Specifically, Horlbeck told Tillman that he had simply used the wrong formula for calculating the net asset value of the investment accounts and that the hedge fund performed poorly because of market influences. As Tillman puts it, \"Horlbeck crafted his story ... to create the false impression that he did nothing wrong, that everything was just an accounting error.\" (Adv. Dkt. 107 at 9-10.) In telling that story, Horlbeck also actively downplayed the existence and intensity of the FINRA investigation. At the same time, Horlbeck admitted to FINRA that he had intentionally inflated the account values on the hedge fund's quarterly statements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   Intent to deceive may be logically inferred from Horlbeck's failure to disclose both that he had intentionally inflated account values and that he was under serious investigation by FINRA. Horlbeck should have known the effect that that information would have had on Tillman's willingness to extend credit to him. In fact, it is likely that Horlbeck chose to make false representations and omit that information because of the effect he knew it would have on negotiations with Tillman. Based on these circumstances, the Court finds that Horlbeck intended to deceive Tillman with respect to his mismanagement of the fund and the FINRA investigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   <strong>\n    c. Justifiable Reliance\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   The final element of \u00a7 523(a)(2)(A) is that the creditor's reliance on the false representation or omission must be \"justifiable.\"\n   <em>\n    Field v.

Specifically, Horlbeck contends that Tillman did not rely, justifiably or otherwise, on any representation or omission. Horlbeck further argues that to the extent that he disclosed the FINRA investigation, that disclosure triggered a duty on Tillman to investigate further, and failure to do so made Tillman's reliance unjustifiable. According to Horlbeck, Tillman did not rely on any representations or omissions because Tillman's conduct in retaining counsel, investigating, and entering into a settlement agreement demonstrates that Tillman believed that Horlbeck had engaged in wrongdoing. In support of that argument, Horlbeck cites to\n   <em>\n    Field v. Mans\n   </em>\n   for the proposition that a creditor cannot justifiably rely on a debtor's statement if a reasonable person with the creditor's\n   knowledge and intelligence would know that the statement was false at a cursory glance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   Horlbeck's argument is meritless. As discussed above, the Supreme Court rejected the reasonable person standard in\n   <em>\n    Field v. Mans\n   </em>\n   and instead held that a subjective justifiable reliance standard applies to \u00a7 523(a)(2)(A).\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 77,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6476672,323761\" index=\"119\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/116/437/\">\n    116 S.Ct. 437\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Horlbeck correctly states, however, that a creditor cannot claim that it relied on a debtor's representation if the creditor knew the representation was false.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Soules v.

Despite Horlbeck's accurate recitation of that rule, its application to the present case is misplaced. Tillman might have\n   <em>\n    believed\n   </em>\n   or\n   <em>\n    suspected\n   </em>\n   that Horlbeck engaged in wrongdoing, but there is no evidence that Tillman\n   <em>\n    knew\n   </em>\n   any of the representations were false. Tillman's belief or suspicion of Horlbeck's wrongdoing does not negate the possibility of reliance on statements that he made. To the contrary, Tillman's likely purpose in investigating Horlbeck was to obtain reliable information from him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   The Court also rejects Horlbeck's second argument, that Tillman's reliance is not justified because Tillman failed to investigate further upon the disclosure of some information about FINRA. As discussed above, there is no affirmative duty to investigate under the justifiable reliance standard.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Field\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"323761\" index=\"123\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/516/59/#p74\">\n    516 U.S. at 70\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6476672,323761\" index=\"124\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/116/437/\">\n    116 S.Ct. 437\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

As previously discussed, several of Horlbeck's letters and emails to Tillman mentioned FINRA but discouraged involving the regulator. The correspondence did not contain any obvious falsehoods that would have triggered a duty to investigate further. Thus, the evidence shows that Tillman justifiably relied on false representations and omissions made by Horlbeck with the intent to deceive in connection with the Settlement Agreement and Promissory Note.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   Having determined that all of the elements of \u00a7 523(a)(2)(A) have been satisfied, the Court will deny Horlbeck's motion for summary judgment on Count II of the amended complaint under \u00a7 523(a)(2)(A). In addition, although Tillman did not file a cross-motion on Count II, the Court will grant summary judgment\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   in Tillman's favor under \u00a7 523(a)(2)(A).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed.

Dkt. 85 at 15.) The distinction that Horlbeck tries to make between \"contingent liabilities\" and \"possibilities of a claim\" is disingenuous. Horlbeck undisputedly sent letters to the hedge fund's investors, promising checks and promissory notes contingent on the execution of releases. On Horlbeck's own terms, the liabilities to other investors on those promissory notes were contingent. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Adv. Dkt. 85-37 at 7, Ex. 11 (\"I will enter in a promissory note ... which you will receive a copy of upon execution of the enclosed release\"); Ex. 12 (\"enclosed is a photocopy of your check which will be sent to you directly ... when we receive the enclosed release signed ... [it] is not quite the full amount owed, but you will receive a promissory note for additional payments ....\").) Horlbeck even admitted that he \"sent letters to the Fund's investors ... indicating that checks and promissory notes representing the balance owed to investors were being sent to the investors,\n   <em>\n    contingent\n   </em>\n   upon receiving their releases.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7 (emphasis added).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   Next, Horlbeck argues that even if he did have a duty to disclose the contingent liabilities to other investors, there is no way to determine whether they were material because there is no evidence of the amount owed. That is, if the amounts owed were very small, then the omitted liabilities would not have been material because such a minimal amount would not have influenced Tillman's decision to extend credit. The evidence offered by Horlbeck himself, however, provides enough information to determine that the liabilities omitted from the Financial Affidavit were material.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   In the August 28, 2009 letters, Horlbeck proposed to pay investors $464,988. Later, in the November 10, 2009 letters, he stated that he had received most of the settlements and releases back. The first letters establish that Horlbeck had contingent liabilities to investors of at least $464,988. The second letters establish that some of the contingent liabilities became fixed after investors executed releases, while the other liabilities remained contingent upon the signing of releases. One month after signing the Financial Affidavit, in the on-the-record interview with FINRA, Horlbeck even admitted that he had been continually paying some investors under promissory notes. Further, about six years after the letters were written, schedule F of Horlbeck's bankruptcy petition listed $1.3 million owed to investors for \"promissory notes.\" Those notes were dated between\n   2008 and 2010, and the amounts range from $7,093.60 to $550,000.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   Based on the 2009 letters, Horlbeck agreed to pay investors at least $464,988, fixed in part and contingent in part. The figures from Horlbeck's bankruptcy petition, however, show that he may have owed a whole lot more. Even without the exact figures, the evidence establishes that the liabilities that Horlbeck left off the Financial Affidavit were substantial, making the omission of them material for purposes of \u00a7 523(a)(2)(B).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   <strong>\n    b.

(Adv. Dkt. 82 at 10.) In response, Horlbeck contends that Tillman's \u00a7 523(a)(2)(B) claim must fail because it would have been impossible for Tillman to have actually relied on the Financial Affidavit, which was dated October 14, 2010, when signing the Settlement Agreement on September 27, 2010. Horlbeck further argues that even if Tillman can prove actual reliance, that reliance was unreasonable because the contingent liabilities and promissory notes were disclosed in earlier letters.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   Horlbeck's first argument is unsubstantiated. When Tillman's attorney sent the signed Settlement Agreement to Horlbeck's attorney, he included an instruction to hold it in escrow subject to receipt and approval of documents from Horlbeck. The Settlement Agreement did not become finalized until Tillman received all of the documents, including the Financial Affidavit. The information contained in the Affidavit was clearly material to Tillman for purposes of entering into the Settlement Agreement and Promissory Note. As such, the evidence shows that Tillman actually relied on the Financial Affidavit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   Further, Tillman's reliance on the Financial Affidavit was reasonable. With knowledge of the settlement offers that had been made to other investors, Tillman negotiated with Horlbeck and required him to disclose liabilities as part of their agreement. Apparently, the Financial Affidavit was sufficient to dispel any of Tillman's concerns about other liabilities. It is\n   not the Court's place to subjectively evaluate Tillman's decision to extend credit to Horlbeck. Rather, the Court must determine only whether Tillman's reliance was \"so unreasonable as not to be actual reliance at all.\" In light of Tillman's insistence on the completion of the Financial Affidavit, the Court concludes that its reliance was reasonable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   <strong>\n    c.

Tillman argues that Horlbeck's deceptive intent should be inferred because he knew, or at least should have known, that information about the debt to other investors should have been disclosed in the Financial Affidavit. Horlbeck offers no direct response on the issue of intent but instead focuses his argument on whether he had a duty to disclose the debts or, as he calls them, the \"possibilities of claims.\" The Court has already considered that argument and found that the debts were contingent liabilities which Horlbeck had a duty to disclose. The Court concludes that intent to deceive has been established because Horlbeck showed reckless disregard for the accuracy of the Financial Affidavit, and he knew or should have known that the omission of liabilities from the Affidavit would induce Tillman to extend credit. Thus, Tillman has satisfied all of the elements of \u00a7 523(a)(2)(B). Accordingly, the Court will grant Tillman's motion for summary judgment on Count III of the amended complaint under \u00a7 523(a)(2)(B), and Horlbeck's cross-motion will be denied.

To the contrary, under\n    <em>\n     Brown\n    </em>\n    , bankruptcy courts must look behind the settlement agreement to determine whether the nature of the underlying debt falls into one of the categories of debts that are not dischargeable pursuant to \u00a7 523(a).\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1532050\" index=\"163\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/442/127/\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"7\">\n   <p id=\"p-151\">\n    \"In other words, the entry of summary judgment [\n    <em>\n     sua sponte\n    </em>\n    ] is inappropriate when it takes a party by surprise.\"\n    <em>\n     Goldstein\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"452520\" index=\"164\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/86/749/#p751\">\n     86 F.3d at 750\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . Here, it would be absurd to say that the entry of summary judgment for Tillman under \u00a7 523(a)(2)(A) will take Horlbeck by surprise. Horlbeck's \u00a7 523(a)(2)(A) motion, along with the related response, reply, statements of fact, and evidence, thoroughly addressed every element of that exception to discharge. Although Tillman did not expressly request judgment under \u00a7 523(a)(2)(A), the parties, Horlbeck in particular, were on notice that summary judgment was being considered.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
