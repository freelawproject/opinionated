Fagone, United States Bankruptcy Judge\n   Resurgent Capital Services, L.P. and the United States Trustee have locked horns in a pitched battle over Resurgent's claim filing practices in bankruptcy cases across the country. In this adversary proceeding, the United States Trustee takes particular aim at Resurgent's practice of affixing an employee's signature to a proof of claim and then filing the proof of claim, all without prior review of the proof of claim by that employee. By the United States Trustee's lights, this practice justifies the imposition of sanctions under Fed. R. Bankr. P. 9011 and otherwise. Resurgent concedes that this practice-which has since been discontinued-was not a best practice. It maintains, however, that the practice did not violate the Bankruptcy Code or the Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure and does not warrant the imposition of sanctions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   While aspects of Resurgent's practices could-and should-have been designed to produce more accurate proofs of claim, its practices were not so egregiously deficient to warrant the imposition of sanctions. On this summary judgment record, the Court is unwilling to declare that Resurgent should be sanctioned for the proof of claim it filed in the Cushmans' chapter 13 case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I. The Summary Judgment Record\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The Pleadings and Summary Judgment Motions\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Resurgent commenced this adversary proceeding against William K. Harrington, United States Trustee for Region 1 (the \"UST\"), by filing a complaint for declaratory relief under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202201\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2201\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Specifically, Resurgent requests a declaratory judgment that (a) it is neither necessary nor appropriate to impose sanctions under Rule 9011,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20105\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 105\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , or any other source of authority on account of the proof of claim filed by Resurgent in the Cushmans' chapter 13 case (the \"Cushman POC\"); and (b) to the extent that the amounts sought in the Cushman POC are factually accurate, Resurgent need not amend that proof of claim.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The UST answered Resurgent's complaint, asserted a counterclaim, and filed a third-party complaint against Resurgent's affiliate, LVNV Funding, LLC. Through the counterclaim and third-party complaint, the UST asks the Court to use Rule 9011, section 105(a), or its inherent authority, to (a) impose monetary sanctions against Resurgent and LVNV; (b) suspend Resurgent's CM/ECF privileges and impose a monitoring requirement on Resurgent's proof of claim filing in this District for one year; (c) strike the Cushman POC; and (d) enjoin Resurgent and LVNV from filing \"Robo-signed\" proofs of claim in this District.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   After a pretrial conference, the Court issued an order making D. Me. Civ. R. 56(h) applicable to this proceeding. The parties then sought leave to file cross-motions for summary judgment and proposed a briefing schedule. The Court granted the parties' request and adopted their schedule. Resurgent and the UST then filed cross-motions for summary judgment on Resurgent's complaint. Although the cross-motions do not address the UST's counterclaim or his third-party complaint, the summary judgment record contains a significant amount of evidence\n   that bears on the extent of an appropriate sanction in addition to the initial question of whether there is any basis for imposing sanctions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    B. The Source of the Facts\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The evaluation of a summary judgment record is governed by D. Me. Civ. R. 56, which defines the evidence the Court may consider in determining whether genuine issues of material fact exist.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   D. Me. LBR 7056-1 (making most of D. Me. Civ. R. 56 applicable in adversary proceedings);\n   <em>\n    Doe v. Solvay Pharms., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9166811\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/350/257/#p259\">\n    350 F.Supp.2d 257\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 259-60 (D. Me. 2004) (\"The evidence the Court may consider in deciding ... a summary judgment motion is circumscribed by the Local Rules of this District.\"). A party seeking summary judgment must file a statement of material facts as to which it contends there is no genuine dispute. D. Me. Civ. R. 56(b). Each fact included in that statement must be separately set forth in a numbered paragraph and supported by a specific record citation. D. Me. Civ. R. 56(b), (f). A party opposing a motion for summary judgment is required to submit an opposing statement of material facts that admits, denies, or qualifies the moving party's factual assertions, and supports each denial or qualification with a specific record citation. D. Me. Civ. R. 56(c). The opposing statement may also include additional facts supported by specific record citations. D. Me. Civ. R. 56(c), (f). A party replying to an opposition to a motion for summary judgment must submit a reply statement of material facts that admits, denies, or qualifies the additional facts submitted by the opposing party, and supports each denial or qualification with a specific record citation. D. Me. Civ. R. 56(d), (f). The parties' stipulations of fact control over any conflicting statements of fact. D. Me. Civ. R. 56(b). If a statement of fact is supported by a proper citation, the fact is deemed admitted unless it is properly controverted. D. Me. Civ. R. 56(f);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(e)(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The summary judgment record in this proceeding consists of several components. First, the parties filed a stipulation of facts containing 106 paragraphs (\"Stip.\"). Second, the Court considered the allegations in the complaint that were admitted by the UST. Next, the Court took judicial notice of certain facts reflected on the docket in the Cushmans' chapter 13 case. Finally, the Court considered the statements of fact submitted by the parties under D. Me. Civ. R. 56. Resurgent submitted 84 statements of material fact (\"SMF\"). The UST admitted 32 of these facts, denied 15, and qualified his response to the remaining 37; he also submitted 93 counterstatements of material fact (\"CSMF\"). Resurgent admitted 51 of these facts, denied 9, and qualified its response to the other 33.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Before recounting the facts, some explanation of the Court's approach to the summary judgment record is warranted. Many of the facts-including all of the genuinely disputed facts and many of the undisputed facts-have been omitted from the recitation below because they are not material.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Conversely, certain undisputed facts have been included, not necessarily because each of them standing alone is material, but because collectively they provide context for evaluating Resurgent's conduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Finally, the Court expended significant efforts evaluating the facts that were qualified under D. Me. Civ. R. 56(c) and (d). The Court considered whether a qualification disputed the evidentiary support for the corresponding statement or, instead,\n   merely challenged the statement's significance. If a qualification merely challenged the significance of the corresponding statement, the Court disregarded the qualification and deemed the statement to have been admitted.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(e)(2) ;\n   <em>\n    Solvay Pharms., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9166811\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/350/257/#p259\">\n    350 F.Supp.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   273 n.11.

The Facts\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-23\">\n    <strong>\n     A. The Cushmans' Chapter 13 Case\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-24\">\n    Laurence and Carlene Cushman started their chapter 13 case in August 2014. They scheduled Credit One Bank as the holder of a general unsecured claim in the amount of $540.00 arising out of Mrs. Cushman's credit card account ending in 0642. Shortly after the chapter 13 filing, Resurgent filed the proof of claim at the nucleus of this dispute. There were no objections to the claim, and it was expressly allowed. The Cushmans' plan was confirmed, and the chapter 13 trustee made a 100% distribution to the holders of allowed unsecured claims, including a distribution of $575.49 to Resurgent. In December 2017, the Cushmans received a discharge.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-25\">\n    <strong>\n     B. The Cushman POC\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-26\">\n    Resurgent filed the Cushman POC on behalf of LVNV, Stip. \u00b6 3, using the CM/ECF credentials assigned to Resurgent, SMF \u00b6 51. The Cushman POC identified LVNV as the creditor and indicated that notices should be sent to Resurgent. It listed $575.49 as the amount of the claim and indicated that the claim arose out of a credit card. The proof of claim stated that LVNV identified the debtor with an account number ending in 0642, and that the debtor may have scheduled the account as held by Credit One Bank, N.A.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-27\">\n    The account detail attached to the Cushman POC included Ms. Cushman's name, address, and redacted social security number; the name of the trustee when the proof of claim was filed; and the case number and chapter. The account detail identified the \"Current Creditor\" as \"LVNV Funding, LLC its successors and assigns as assignee of FNBM, LLC\"; indicated that LVNV purchased the debt from FNBM; and identified Credit One Bank, N.A. as an alternative name for the creditor and as the creditor at the time of the last transaction. The account detail provided the last four digits of the account number associated with the claim (0642); indicated that the debt was charged off on September 8, 2014; and stated that the last payment date and last transaction date were April 13, 2014. In addition, the account detail listed a balance of $575.49 as of the petition date, consisting entirely of principal with no interest or fees. This information about the balance and character of the debt was flagged with asterisks and a notation that the information \"was obtained from the data files received from the assignor and other information such as Bankruptcy Court records.\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-28\">\n    Resurgent acquired information about the debt underlying the Cushman POC through the data string in the sale file that it received when it agreed to service the debt. SMF \u00b6\u00b6 4, 57, 60. Resurgent typically relies on the information provided in such files, and it did so here. SMF \u00b6 58. The data string and the related credit card billing statements showed a principal balance of $396.46, CSMF \u00b6 82, described the debt as being composed partly of interest, SMF \u00b6\u00b6 59-60, and detailed a total prepetition debt that matches the $575.49 on the proof of claim, SMF \u00b6\u00b6 59, 63. The data string reported a last payment date of April 13, 2014, but did not report a last\n    transaction date.\n    <footnotemark>\n     3\n    </footnotemark>\n    The billing statements showed that the last payment was made on April 12, 2014, and that the last transaction took place on May 22, 2014. Stip. \u00b6\u00b6 61-62.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-29\">\n    When the Cushman POC was filed in 2014, SMF \u00b6 3, the applicable form was Official Form 10, SMF \u00b6 42. Part 8 of that form, entitled \"Signature,\" instructed the person signing the form to identify as the creditor, the creditor's authorized agent, or someone else. Official Form 10 included the following attestation above the signature line: \"I declare under penalty of perjury that the information provided in this claim is true and correct to the best of my knowledge, information, and reasonable belief.\" Next to the signature line, Official Form 10 provided a space for the signer's printed name, title, and company.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-30\">\n    Like many other Official Forms, Official Form 10 provided instructions to the user. The instructions did not purport to follow the law with exactitude; instead, they were \"general explanations of the law.\" Instruction No. 8, relating to the date and signature, provided:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n    The individual completing this proof of claim must sign and date it. FRBP 9011. If the claim is filed electronically, FRBP 5005(a)(2) authorizes courts to establish local rules specifying what constitutes a signature. If you sign this form, you declare under penalty of perjury that the information provided is true and correct to the best of your knowledge, information, and reasonable belief. Your signature is also a certification that the claim meets the requirements of FRBP 9011(b). Whether the claim is filed electronically or in person, if your name is on the signature line, you are responsible for the declaration. Print the name and title, if any, of the creditor or other person authorized to file this claim. State the filer's address and telephone number if it differs from the address given on the top of the form for purposes of receiving notices. If the claim is filed by an authorized agent, provide both the name of the individual filing the claim and the name of the agent. If the authorized agent is a servicer, identify the corporate servicer as the company. Criminal penalties apply for making a false statement on a proof of claim.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-32\">\n    The Cushman POC was prepared on Official Form 10, CSMF \u00b6 86, and bears the signature of Susan Gaines, Stip. \u00b6 53. Above Ms. Gaines's signature, a box is checked indicating, \"I am the creditor's authorized agent.\" Above Ms. Gaines's signature, the Cushman POC states, \"I declare under penalty of perjury that the information provided in this claim is true and correct to the best of my knowledge, information, and reasonable belief.\" CSMF \u00b6 75. Next to her signature, Ms. Gaines's name appears in print along with her title (Claims Processor) and company name (Resurgent Capital Services).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-33\">\n    When the Cushman POC was filed, Ms. Gaines had no knowledge, information, or belief about any debts owed by the Cushmans, including any debts that they may have owed to Resurgent or LVNV. CSMF \u00b6\u00b6 21-22. Ms. Gaines did not review the Cushman POC before it was filed. Stip. \u00b6 54. Instead, the information included in the proof of claim was reviewed and approved by Nancy Gosnell, Stip. \u00b6 55, a\n    contract management supervisor in Resurgent's bankruptcy department, Stip. \u00b6 57.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-34\">\n    <strong>\n     C. Resurgent's Claim Preparation and Filing Practices\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-35\">\n    Resurgent services consumer debt portfolios for affiliated companies like LVNV, Stip. \u00b6\u00b6 1-2, and it regularly files proofs of claim in bankruptcy cases, Stip. \u00b6 8. In so doing, Resurgent relies on data provided by others. Stip. \u00b6 13. When LVNV acquires an account that Resurgent will service, the sale file from that purchase is loaded into Resurgent's Account Master Computer System (\"AMCS\"). Stip. \u00b6\u00b6 10-11. The sale file contains a string of data about the underlying debt, Stip. \u00b6 12, such as the debtor's name, address, account number, social security number, debt origination date, last payment amount and date, charge-off balance and date, filing date balance, principal balance, and fee and interest balance, CSMF \u00b6 28. The data string does not include a field for the date of the last transaction.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-36\">\n    Resurgent takes several measures to ensure the quality of the data it receives and utilizes. SMF \u00b6 6. Resurgent and its affiliates ordinarily secure representations and warranties for the material accuracy of the data related to debts that will be purchased or serviced, and one of Resurgent's affiliates received representations and warranties related to the debt underlying the Cushman POC.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    SMF \u00b6\u00b6 7-8.\n    <footnotemark>\n     4\n    </footnotemark>\n    Resurgent's quality control team also analyzes the data it receives for common discrepancies and missing information. SMF \u00b6 9. When Resurgent receives a sale file, sometimes it also receives other documents related to a debt, such as billing statements. SMF \u00b6 4. When Resurgent does not receive such documents at the time of purchase, it may later request them from the seller. SMF \u00b6 5.\n    <footnotemark>\n     5\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-37\">\n    Resurgent's procedure to confirm that an unsecured proof of claim may be properly filed includes multiple steps. SMF \u00b6 3. In the first step, referred to by Resurgent as the \"match\" step, Resurgent confirms that the obligor has filed for bankruptcy. Stip. \u00b6 14; SMF \u00b6 3. Resurgent's second step, dubbed the \"research\" step, involves confirming that the debt has not been previously discharged. Stip. \u00b6 14; SMF \u00b6 3. Finally, in the \"review\" step, Resurgent prepares, reviews, and files a proof of claim. SMF \u00b6\u00b6 3, 11.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-38\">\n    In the \"match\" step, Resurgent matches accounts that it services with new bankruptcy filings through a system known as Bankruptcy Notifications or \"BKN.\" Stip. \u00b6 80. Where BKN can determine with a high degree of reliability that a new bankruptcy filing matches an account serviced by Resurgent, the account moves automatically to the next step. Stip. \u00b6 83. Where BKN cannot determine whether a new bankruptcy filing matches a Resurgent account, a Resurgent employee manually reviews the account information and the bankruptcy information. Stip. \u00b6 84. When a match is established, the account is updated in AMCS to show that a bankruptcy case is pending, information about the account is loaded into Resurgent's bankruptcy servicing system (\"BKS\"), and the account moves on to the \"research\" step. Stip. \u00b6\u00b6 84-85.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-39\">\n    The \"research\" step is designed to ensure that the debt was not discharged in a prior bankruptcy case. Stip. \u00b6 86. When the debtor is a first-time filer or the debtor's prior bankruptcy cases were dismissed, the account moves automatically to the next step. Stip. \u00b6 88. Otherwise, a Resurgent employee reviews the debtor's prior bankruptcy cases to determine whether the debt was discharged. Stip. \u00b6 89.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-40\">\n    After completing the first two steps, in appropriate circumstances (\n    <em>\n     i.e.\n    </em>\n    , a matched debt and no prior discharge of the debt), Resurgent moves to the last step, the \"review\" step. SMF \u00b6 11. At that point, BKS automatically generates and populates a proof of claim form with the account information maintained in BKS, which is derived from AMCS and ultimately from the sale file provided by the account seller or owner. Stip. \u00b6\u00b6 15-16. The review conducted by Resurgent's claims processors is performed using the BKS platform. Stip. \u00b6 17. BKS was originally designed so that claims processors did not ordinarily review the populated proof of claim form, but instead reviewed the data on the BKS screen that was used to populate the form. CSMF \u00b6 25; Stip. \u00b6 23. On the BKS screen, claims processors view four columns of information: (1) account information previously obtained by BKS from AMCS, which was used to populate the proof of claim; (2) up-to-date account information obtained by BKS from AMCS; (3) information about the filer and the bankruptcy case pulled from the court docket; and (4) co-filer information pulled from the court docket. Stip. \u00b6 18. The BKS system highlights any information that does not match across the columns on the screen. Stip. \u00b6 19. Some of the columns do not appear unless the BKS system highlights a discrepancy. CSMF \u00b6 29.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-41\">\n    Resurgent's work instructions direct claims processors to approve a proof of claim in the absence of a highlighted discrepancy, though claims processors may have some discretion to do otherwise. SMF \u00b6 13; CSMF \u00b6 30. Claims processors generally do not review the underlying documents related to a debt or otherwise verify the data pulled from BKS and AMCS.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-42\">\n    Stip. \u00b6 24. In general, they do not review debtors' schedules, billing statements, or other information external to Resurgent's systems. CSMF \u00b6 27. It typically takes less than 30 seconds for a claims processor to review a proof of claim. Stip. \u00b6 22. In the absence of a highlighted discrepancy, a claims processor may review and approve a claim expeditiously; it is not unusual to do so in as little as 10 seconds. Stip. \u00b6 20. If BKS highlights a discrepancy, the proof of claim may still be approved if the claims processor can apply Resurgent's work instructions to resolve the discrepancy. Stip. \u00b6 21.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-43\">\n    When a claims processor approves a proof of claim, the proof of claim is filed, where possible, with a tool called \"autopost,\" which automatically posts proofs of claim to claims registers using CM/ECF credentials. Stip. \u00b6\u00b6 26-27. In jurisdictions that do not permit automatic posting, the claims processor files the proof of claim manually through the CM/ECF system. Stip. \u00b6 28. If the claims processor does not approve a proof of claim, the claims processor selects a basis for the rejection and the proof of claim goes into the rejection queue. Stip. \u00b6\u00b6 29-30.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-44\">\n    Resurgent's quality control group conducts periodic audits of its proof-of-claim filing processes. Stip. \u00b6\u00b6 91, 93. In 2014, the quality control group reported that Resurgent maintained a 99.81% score in its unsecured claims filing process based on the criteria sampled. Stip. \u00b6 98. The audit process compares the information on the proof of claim form with the information in the BKS system and does not involve review of documents extrinsic to the BKS system. Stip. \u00b6 99. Other than identifying the correct account owner, none of the criteria sampled related to the substantive accuracy of a proof of claim. CSMF \u00b6 88. When the quality control group identifies a mistake in a proof of claim, the mistake is discussed with the claims processor who reviewed and approved the proof of claim. Stip. \u00b6 96.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-45\">\n    Resurgent also has a proof of claim objection team that reviews each objection to a Resurgent proof of claim, and either handles the objection internally or retains counsel to respond. SMF \u00b6 17. Less than four percent of the proofs of claim that Resurgent filed in 2013 and 2014 were subject to filed objections. SMF \u00b6 16.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-46\">\n    Resurgent has always used a fully manual process to prepare secured proofs of claim. Stip. \u00b6 102. Resurgent's policy and practice has been that all proofs of claim for secured debt must be signed by the person who prepared or reviewed the proof of claim or the information contained in it. Stip. \u00b6 101. Each of Resurgent's secured proofs of claim is therefore manually completed by an individual reviewer who gathers the necessary supporting documentation before personally signing and filing the proof of claim. Stip. \u00b6 103.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-47\">\n    <strong>\n     D. Susan Gaines's Signature\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-48\">\n    In 2011, Resurgent began using Ms. Gaines's signature on all of its unsecured proofs of claim. Stip. \u00b6 49. At that time, Ms. Gaines gave Resurgent a digital copy of her signature and authorized Resurgent to use it on all unsecured proofs of claim, including proofs of claim that she would not personally review. Stip. \u00b6 51. From 2011 to April 2015, Resurgent's practice was to automatically affix Ms. Gaines's signature to all unsecured proofs of claim upon generation, regardless of whether Ms. Gaines reviewed the proof of claim or the information in it. Stip. \u00b6\u00b6 35-36, 49. During this period, claims processors did not have the ability to change the signature from Ms. Gaines's to their own, Stip. \u00b6 37, even though the BKS system could have been designed to allow that. CSMF \u00b6 2.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-49\">\n    In the District of Maine, between December 21, 2011 and September 25, 2013, Resurgent filed at least 149 proofs of claim bearing Ms. Gaines's signature that Resurgent is unable to demonstrate that Ms. Gaines reviewed. Stip. \u00b6 48. In 2013, Resurgent filed 158,763 unsecured proofs of claim in bankruptcy courts across the country. Stip. \u00b6 45. Ms. Gaines reviewed 67,216 of those proofs of claim, but Resurgent cannot demonstrate that Ms. Gaines reviewed any of the remaining 91,547. Stip. \u00b6 45. In 2014, Resurgent filed 151,716 unsecured proofs of claim. Stip. \u00b6 46. That year, Ms. Gaines reviewed 97,344 of the unsecured proofs of claim that Resurgent filed, while the remaining 54,372 were reviewed by another claims processor but bore Ms. Gaines's signature. Stip. \u00b6 46.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-50\">\n    David Richard, a vice president in Resurgent's bankruptcy department, and Lisa Landreth, Resurgent's manager of contract management, authorized and were aware of Resurgent's practice of putting Ms. Gaines's signature on all unsecured proofs of claim. Stip. \u00b6 38. They were unsure who had first decided to use Ms. Gaines's signature in that way and they did not know why that decision had been made. CSMF \u00b6 5. Mr. Richard headed Resurgent's bankruptcy department between 2012 and November 2014. SMF \u00b6 39. During that time, he received no training on Rule 9011 as it related to filing proofs of claim, and he may not have been aware of that rule. CSMF \u00b6 3. At some point, Mr. Richard reviewed the proof of claim form and considered the propriety of Resurgent's practice of affixing Ms. Gaines's signature to all unsecured proofs of claim. SMF \u00b6\u00b6 40-41. Mr. Richard believes that he consulted with Resurgent's legal group about that practice, but it is not clear when that consultation might have occurred. CSMF \u00b6 92.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-51\">\n    <strong>\n     E. Ms. Gaines's Confidence in Resurgent's Systems\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-52\">\n    Ms. Gaines has been a claims processor at Resurgent since 2004. Stip. \u00b6 40. In 2014, her duties included reviewing and filing unsecured proofs of claim. Stip. \u00b6 42. When reviewing proofs of claim, Ms. Gaines looked for discrepancies highlighted by the BKS system. CSMF \u00b6 32. She did not engage in a manual review to determine whether the BKS system had missed something, and she did not look for anything other than highlighted discrepancies on the BKS screen. CSMF \u00b6 32. If the BKS system highlighted a discrepancy, Ms. Gaines could either resolve the discrepancy or refer it to the research team or to her supervisor. CSMF \u00b6 32. Ms. Gaines never rejected a claim unless the BKS system highlighted a discrepancy. CSMF \u00b6 31. At the time that the Cushman POC was filed, she looked at the proof of claim form approximately one time out of every thousand claims. CSMF \u00b6 26.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-53\">\n    In 2014, Ms. Gaines was Resurgent's only full-time claims processor, but Resurgent had nine other employees who worked as claims processors on a part-time basis. Stip. \u00b6 41; CSMF \u00b6 33. Ms. Gaines had no supervisory authority over other claims processors, Stip. \u00b6 43, but she was the primary trainer for every other Resurgent employee who reviewed, approved, or filed unsecured proofs of claim, SMF \u00b6 23. Ms. Gaines was responsible for training claims processors to follow Resurgent's work instructions. SMF \u00b6 25. When claims processors were new to the system, they received one-on-one training from Ms. Gaines and were given a copy of the work instructions. SMF \u00b6 24; CSMF \u00b6 34. Those work instructions did not include any information about the penalties for perjury, the instructions on the proof of claim form, Rule 9011, or the fact that the BKS system put Ms. Gaines's signature on\n    every unsecured proof of claim. CSMF \u00b6 39. The work instructions were technical documents that told claims processors: how to pull up the BKS screen; to refer real estate claims to the secured bankruptcy department; how to comply with Resurgent's guidelines for filing time-barred debt; not to file proofs of claim in a certain jurisdiction unless the last payment date, the charge-off date, and the origination date were included; to approve a proof of claim in the absence of a highlighted discrepancy; and to include statements and chain of ownership in certain jurisdictions. CSMF \u00b6 39.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-54\">\n    Ms. Gosnell received training from Ms. Gaines on how to review and approve unsecured proofs of claim before she reviewed and approved the Cushman POC. SMF \u00b6 53. She generally followed Resurgent's work instructions when determining whether to approve proofs of claim. SMF \u00b6 54. She understood that a person signing a proof of claim had to believe that the information contained in the proof of claim was accurate. SMF \u00b6 55. But, she was not sure whether the signature on the proof of claim form was made under penalty of perjury, had never read the instructions on the form \"word for word,\" and was unaware of the existence of Rule 9011. CSMF \u00b6\u00b6 41-43. In 2014, Ms. Gosnell did not look at the actual proof of claim form or review billing statements before approving a proof of claim. CSMF \u00b6 46. At that time, claims processors rarely reviewed the populated proof of claim form when reviewing a proof of claim. Stip. \u00b6 23. Instead, they reviewed the columns shown on the BKS screen, which reflected, among other information, the data used to populate the proof of claim form. Stip. \u00b6 23.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-55\">\n    Although Ms. Gaines was familiar with the instructions on the proof of claim form, SMF \u00b6 19, she did not provide any information to claims processors about those instructions, CSMF \u00b6 37. She only \"ask[ed] that they review the proof of claim form and let [her] know if they had any questions.\" CSMF \u00b6 37. When she was deposed by the UST, Ms. Gaines did not know who at Resurgent was responsible for ensuring compliance with legal requirements for filing proofs of claim, and she did not remember asking anyone about legal compliance during the last several years. CSMF \u00b6 13. As of July 2017, Ms. Gaines had never read or seen a copy of Rule 9011. CSMF \u00b6 14. She did not know, even approximately, how many claims were reviewed by others and then filed using her signature under penalty of perjury. CSMF \u00b6 17.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-56\">\n    Ms. Gaines was not an expert in many of Resurgent's processes. CSMF \u00b6 24. She did not know whether Resurgent's clients all provided the same account information; had no familiarity with the entities that sold claims to Resurgent's affiliates; did not know whether the sale file provided by debt sellers or customers included billing statements; did not know which department imported information into AMCS; did not know where case information came from; did not know what would happen if there was an error in the data; did not know whether anyone else at Resurgent checked debtor schedules or other information outside of AMCS to verify the accuracy of proofs of claim; and did not know whether Resurgent's affiliates received any representations or warranties from the seller. CSMF \u00b6 24. She was aware that others audited Resurgent's proofs of claim, SMF \u00b6 34, but was not involved in that auditing process and did not know what criteria the quality control group used in its audits, CSMF \u00b6 24. Ms. Gaines's responsibilities did not extend to many facets of Resurgent's bankruptcy department, and she had only limited knowledge of many of Resurgent's processes other than proof of claim review and filing. SMF \u00b6 31.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-57\">\n    She was not involved in designing or maintaining Resurgent's bankruptcy servicing systems beyond proof of claim review and filing. SMF \u00b6 35.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-58\">\n    However, Ms. Gaines was aware that other Resurgent employees were responsible for other aspects of Resurgent's systems and believed that those employees were competent and professional. SMF \u00b6 37. Based on her confidence in Resurgent's systems and her colleagues, she testified: \"I trust the system, I know the people, I have confidence that it's correct.\" SMF \u00b6 38. Ms. Gaines had a general understanding that Resurgent had systems other than proof of claim review and filing that related to proofs of claim. SMF \u00b6 36. She had no knowledge, information, or belief about the debts in relation to which other claims processors reviewed and approved proofs of claim, or the bankruptcy cases in which such proofs of claim were filed. SMF \u00b6 21. But, she had confidence in the other Resurgent employees who reviewed and approved proofs of claim and had confidence in the reliability of Resurgent's systems and processes for validating account information and generating proofs of claim. SMF \u00b6 20. She knew that those claims processors were required to maintain an accuracy rate of at least 97% based on the criteria surveyed in Resurgent's internal audits. SMF \u00b6 27. She was aware that Resurgent's quality control group informed claims processors when it found errors in their work. SMF \u00b6 28. She was also aware that Resurgent only rarely received objections to its proofs of claim. SMF \u00b6 29. During the period that her signature was being affixed to all of Resurgent's unsecured proofs of claim, Ms. Gaines trusted the system. SMF \u00b6 30.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-59\">\n    <strong>\n     F. Changes to Resurgent's Leadership and Proof of Claim Practices\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-60\">\n    In November 2014, Mr. Richard was transitioned out of Resurgent's bankruptcy leadership. Stip. \u00b6 74. Among the catalysts for the change was an email sent in September 2014 by Bryan Faliero, who was then employed by Sherman Capital Markets, to Benjamin Navarro and Brett Hildebrand, who were also principals of Sherman Capital Markets. Stip. \u00b6\u00b6 75-76; CSMF \u00b6 60. In the email, Mr. Faliero raised numerous concerns, including a concern that the signature on Resurgent's proofs of claim did not match the identity of the person who reviewed those proofs of claim. Stip. \u00b6 78. Mr. Faliero stated \"POC filing process (like affidavits) same person review must sign-we find internally that signature of reviewer is not reviewer.\" Stip. \u00b6 78. Mr. Navarro forwarded the email to Tim Grant, then-CEO of Resurgent, with the comment \"Seems like it's time to make a change. What do you think?\" CSMF \u00b6 60.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-61\">\n    Within a month after Mr. Faliero's email, Resurgent began developing an upgrade to its BKS system, known as BKS 1.6.0, that would allow proofs of claim to be generated and filed with the electronic signature and CM/ECF credentials of the individual claims processor who approved the proof of claim. Stip. \u00b6\u00b6 63, 79. The BKS upgrade took several months to execute and was ultimately implemented in April 2015. Stip. \u00b6\u00b6 65-66.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-62\">\n    Meanwhile, on December 1, 2014, Resurgent created a draft policy, \"BU PT-086,\" that specified that \"[a]ll proofs of claim are reviewed and approved by the claim signer.\" Stip. \u00b6 67. The policy was drafted, in part, because a potential seller of debt to LVNV had requested a copy of such a policy. Stip. \u00b6 67. The policy and its specification as to the claim signer were approved on December 29, 2014. Stip. \u00b6 68. The policy was not implemented by Resurgent until February 19, 2015 or later. Stip. \u00b6 69.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-63\">\n    On February 19, 2015, Resurgent learned that the United States Trustee for Region 13 intended to take discovery regarding Resurgent's proof of claim practices in two cases then-pending in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Western District of Missouri. Stip. \u00b6 70.\n    <footnotemark>\n     6\n    </footnotemark>\n    Upon learning of those efforts, Resurgent uploaded BU PT-086 to its procedures library, CSMF \u00b6 72, and prioritized implementation of BKS 1.6.0, Stip. \u00b6 71. Resurgent also discontinued the practice of using Ms. Gaines's signature on proofs of claims she had not reviewed. CSMF \u00b6\u00b6 63, 71. In the interim, before BKS 1.6.0 was ready, Resurgent determined that Ms. Gaines alone should review unsecured proofs of claim. Stip. \u00b6 72.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-64\">\n    BKS 1.6.0 was rolled out in April 2015. Stip. \u00b6 73. Since that time, Resurgent has required, for every unsecured proof of claim, that the reviewer, signer, and filer (\n    <em>\n     i.e.\n    </em>\n    , where applicable, the individual whose CM/ECF credentials are used to file the proof of claim) be the same person. Stip. \u00b6 64. Its current practice is to affix the signature of the claims processor who reviewed the claim to the proof of claim form upon approval. Stip. \u00b6 25. Since July 2016, Resurgent has also required claims processors to review the PDF proof of claim form generated by BKS in addition to their review of the information used to populate the proof of claim form. SMF \u00b6 49.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-65\">\n    Resurgent has historically understood that interest on a credit card debt was recapitalized monthly, such that the total prepetition balance would be properly identified on a proof of claim as principal. SMF \u00b6 64. In December 2016, the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Eastern District of Virginia ruled that, notwithstanding any such recapitalization, Rule 3001 requires a proof of claim to itemize principal and interest. SMF \u00b6 65 (citing\n    <em>\n     Maddux v. Midland Credit Mgmt., Inc.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12269359\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/567/489/\">\n     567 B.R. 489\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (Bankr. E.D. Va. 2016) ). As originally designed, Resurgent's BKS system did not have the ability to break out interest and fees on proofs of claim. CSMF \u00b6 84. However, since that December 2016 ruling, Resurgent has implemented a process to itemize principal and interest on proofs of claim filed in the Eastern District of Virginia, and it is working on a process that would permit such itemization on all proofs of claim filed nationwide. SMF \u00b6 66.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-66\">\n    While the USTP's investigation into Resurgent's signing and filing practices was ongoing, between July 2016 and January 2017, Resurgent caused Ms. Gaines to review, in every bankruptcy case open at that time, all proofs of claim filed with her signature that were originally reviewed and approved by a different claims processor. SMF \u00b6 79. Ms. Gaines reviewed approximately 85,000 proofs of claim, using the same process that she typically uses when reviewing proofs of claim prior to filing. SMF \u00b6 80. In that review, she found fewer than 50 proofs of claim for which the BKS system highlighted discrepancies, and\n    Resurgent withdrew or amended every such proof of claim. SMF \u00b6 81. The Cushman POC was neither withdrawn nor amended as a result of that review.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-67\">\n    <strong>\n     G. Resurgent's Other Practices\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-68\">\n    In October 2011, the Maryland State Collection Agency Licensing Board and Office of the Commission of Financial Regulation entered a summary order directing Resurgent, LVNV, and other affiliates and officers to cease debt collection activities in Maryland. Stip. \u00b6 105. The Board found, among other things, that Resurgent had submitted affidavits that were \"false,\" \"deceptive,\" \"deficient,\" and \"misleading.\" CSMF \u00b6 59. The Board found that Resurgent had submitted affidavits that were based on employees' review of Resurgent's books and records, SMF \u00b6 72, and determined that those employees did not have sufficient personal knowledge of the records to offer competent testimony as required by the Maryland Rules of Procedure, SMF \u00b6 73. The Board also found that Resurgent's employees were not competent to testify about the creation and maintenance of the business records of certain originating creditors or their business practices. SMF \u00b6 74. Without admitting any allegations, Resurgent and LVNV settled the matter in June 2012, agreeing to pay a penalty of $1 million, to dismiss 3,564 cases filed in Maryland, and to provide credits of more than $3.8 million to consumers. Stip. \u00b6 106.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-69\">\n    <strong>\n     H. Amendment of the Proof of Claim Form\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-70\">\n    In 2015, Official Form 10 was replaced by Official Form 410. The attestation in Official Form 410 provides: \"I have examined the information in this Proof of Claim and have a reasonable belief that the information is true and correct. I declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct.\" The revised form also contains an instruction in the margin near the signature line, which reads \"The person completing this proof of claim must sign and date it.

M.D. Pa. 2009) (concluding that Rule 9011 applies to the filing of proofs of claim). The UST observes, quite correctly, that Ms. Gaines's signature appears on the Cushman POC in relative proximity to the instructions indicating that Rule 9011 applied to the proof of claim. Because Ms. Gaines had no personal knowledge of the debt owed by Ms. Cushman to LVNV and because Ms. Gaines did not review the proof of claim before it was presented to the Court, there was, in the UST's estimation, an unmistakable violation of Rule 9011. In the alternative, the UST contends that even if Ms. Gaines had reviewed the Cushman POC, or if Ms. Gosnell had signed the proof of claim, there would still have been a violation of Rule 9011 because the review process \"did not include reading the POC or any documents substantiating the debt, but merely scanning a computer screen for 10-30 seconds to check whether Resurgent's computer system highlighted any discrepancies in Resurgent's internal information.\" Resurgent counters that Ms. Gaines reasonably relied on her coworkers and Resurgent's automated processes, and that there was nothing wrong with her authorizing Resurgent to affix her signature to proof of claim forms she had not reviewed given her familiarity with Resurgent's procedures and employees. Defending its reliance on automated processes, Resurgent asserts that \"[t]he law is not a Luddite. In the twenty-first century, it is surely permissible to rely on a sophisticated computer system to populate a standardized form with data-especially since automation eliminates the human error that accompanies manual input of data.\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-95\">\n    The implication of the UST's initial argument is that\n    <em>\n     Ms. Gaines\n    </em>\n    had a separate and nondelegable duty under Rule 9011. The UST's attempt to treat Ms. Gaines as the Rule 9011 actor finds some traction in the personal pronouns used in the instructions on Official Form 10, the form's references to the \"individual\" completing the proof of claim, and its citation to Rule 9011. The UST's alternate focus on Resurgent's processes is consistent with the view\n    that Rule 9011 responsibility rests with\n    <em>\n     Resurgent\n    </em>\n    as the \"unrepresented party\" that filed the proof of claim. This latter view is the better one.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-96\">\n    Rule 9011 does not, as the UST seems to argue, apply to three categories of actors: attorneys, unrepresented parties,\n    <em>\n     and\n    </em>\n    agents of unrepresented parties (here, Susan Gaines).\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Fed.

Ms. Gaines had no right to enforce the claim and did not seek to activate the claims allowance process for her own benefit when her signature was affixed to the proof of claim form.

An entity's nonlawyer agents may not ordinarily represent the entity in federal court; instead, the entity must appear through a licensed attorney.\n    <em>\n     Schreibman v. Walter E.

As a result of the prohibition on pro se appearances by entities, in most contexts, Rule 9011 applies to individuals: attorneys or individuals appearing pro se. However, entities are specifically permitted to use nonlawyer agents to file proofs of claim.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Fed. R. Bankr. P. 9010(a)(2) (permitting a creditor to perform any act that does not constitute the practice of law through an authorized agent); Fed. R. Bankr.

Thus, when an entity submits a proof of claim through and over the signature of an authorized nonlawyer agent, the entity acts as an unrepresented party for purposes of Rule 9011. Contrary to the UST's contentions, Resurgent's use of Ms. Gaines's signature on the Cushman POC did not give rise to an obligation that Ms. Gaines personally undertake the inquiry required by Rule 9011. Ms. Gaines did not sign on her own behalf. She signed for Resurgent.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Casamatta v. Resurgent Capital Servs., L.P.

R. Bankr. P. 9011 [.]\"). This is an important intermediate conclusion, because it broadens the focus of the next inquiry. Instead of a myopic fixation on the actions and knowledge of a single individual (Ms. Gaines), a proper Rule 9011 analysis looks to the actions and knowledge of the unrepresented party (Resurgent). Because Resurgent is an entity that can lawfully act through multiple agents, the inquiry is necessarily broader than the UST's initial argument suggests.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-100\">\n    Nevertheless, the Court agrees with the UST's assertion that the claims processor who reviewed the Cushman POC should have been the person who signed it. When the Cushman POC was filed, the instructions on Official Form 10 required the individual who completed a proof of claim to sign it and make a declaration under penalty of perjury. Those instructions and the declaration were intended to impose a standard of reasonableness upon \"a real, live person\" who was to \"take responsibility for assuring the accuracy of a proof of claim.\" Minutes, Advisory Comm. on Bankr. Rules, April 29-30, 2010, at 21. Because her signature was affixed to the Cushman POC, Ms. Gaines declared \"under penalty of perjury that the information provided in [that] claim [was] true and accurate to the best of [her] knowledge, information, and reasonable belief.\"\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Official Form 10. The parties disagree about whether Ms. Gaines could have relied on Resurgent's systems to make that declaration in the absence of any personal knowledge of the contents of the Cushman POC, and they dispute the extent to which proofs of claim can be analogized to affidavits. There is no need to resolve those disputes here. This proceeding does not involve a request for damages for perjury, a criminal prosecution for perjury, or any sort of request for relief against Ms. Gaines individually. Instead, this proceeding turns on an alleged violation of Rule 9011(b) and a request for a declaratory judgment as to the propriety of sanctions against Resurgent under,\n    <em>\n     inter alia\n    </em>\n    , Rule 9011(c).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-101\">\n    Resurgent may have failed to comply with the instructions on Official Form 10 by affixing Ms. Gaines's signature to all unsecured proofs of claim generated by the BKS system, including the Cushman POC. If so, Resurgent may have also contravened Rule 3001(a), which requires a proof of claim to \"conform substantially to the appropriate Official Form.\" Fed. R. Bankr. P. 3001(a). But the analysis under Rule 9011 is a separate matter.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     In re Avery\n    </em>\n    , No. 15-30074,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%204498181\">\n     2015 WL 4498181\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , at *3 (Bankr.

If a servicer seeks payment on a debt by filing a proof of claim in a bankruptcy case, the servicer must take measures to ensure that the debtor is liable for the debt. It must also obtain the information about the claim required by Rule 3001(c). Two of the requirements of Rule 3001(c) are implicated here. First, if the debtor is an individual and the claim includes interest or fees incurred prepetition, the proof of claim must be filed with an itemized statement of the interest and fees. Fed. R. Bankr. P. 3001(c)(2)(A). Second, for most claims based on an open-end or revolving consumer credit agreement, the proof of claim must be accompanied by a statement of, among other things, the date of the account holder's last transaction and the date of the last payment.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Fed.

Consistent with its ordinary practices, Resurgent confirmed that Ms. Cushman had filed a bankruptcy case and that the debt had not previously been discharged. Resurgent's affiliate obtained representations and warranties as to the validity of the debt. Resurgent obtained data from its affiliate when it agreed to service the debt and it relied on that data in the ordinary course of business. That data indicated a total debt in the amount of $575.49 and Resurgent asserted a claim for that exact amount. Resurgent thus discharged its Rule 9011 duty to investigate and secure evidence supporting its allegation as to Ms. Cushman's liability for the asserted debt.\n    <em>\n     Cf.\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     In re Wingerter\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3788817,3522013\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/594/931/\">\n     594 F.3d at 934, 940\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (holding that a servicer made a reasonable inquiry into a claim as required by Rule 9011(b) when,\n    <em>\n     inter alia\n    </em>\n    , it relied on warranties as to the validity of the claim, relied on data sold to it, and engaged in processes similar to Resurgent's \"match\" and \"research\" processes).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-107\">\n    Resurgent also made a reasonable inquiry and a representation supported by evidence in its possession as to the date of the last payment on the debt underlying the Cushman POC. The data string reported a last payment date of April 13, 2014. Resurgent's automated processes transferred that date from the data string to AMCS, from AMCS to BKS, and from BKS onto the statement attached to the Cushman POC. Resurgent also obtained billing statements associated with the claim that reported a last payment date of April 12, 2014. When reviewing the Cushman POC before filing, Resurgent did not compare the last payment date reported on the data string with the last payment date reported on the billing statements. Instead, it relied exclusively on the data string.\n    <footnotemark>\n     10\n    </footnotemark>\n    As explained in more detail below, Resurgent's reliance on the data string was not objectively unreasonable. Resurgent's allegation of the last payment date was both preceded by a reasonable inquiry and supported by evidence in its possession.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-108\">\n    The same cannot be said of Resurgent's allegation of the last transaction date. The data string associated with the debt underlying the Cushman POC did not include a column for, or otherwise\n    identify, the last transaction date. Resurgent imported the information in the data string into its system of record and that information was used to populate the statement attached to the proof of claim. Somehow, this automated system of data transfer caused that statement to report that the last transaction occurred on April 13, 2014. It was objectively unreasonable for Resurgent to rely on the data string for information regarding the last transaction date because the data string did not include that type of information. This reliance was culpably careless. To comply with its duty to undertake a reasonable inquiry, Resurgent should have either designed its data string to collect that information or examined the billing statements, which reported a last transaction date of May 22, 2014. Instead, Resurgent made an allegation of the last transaction date that lacked any evidentiary support. Resurgent's contention that this allegation may have benefited the debtor, the trustee, and other creditors does not render its inquiry more reasonable or otherwise provide an evidentiary basis for the allegation. Resurgent's conduct leading up to and including its allegation of the date of the last transaction did not meet the standards of Rule 9011(b).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-109\">\n    Resurgent may have also transgressed Rule 9011(b) by characterizing the entire amount of Ms. Cushman's credit card debt as principal. The data string reported a filing date balance ($575.49) in one column, set forth a principal balance ($396.46) in another column, and aggregated interest and fees ($197.59) in another column. Resurgent apparently relied on its belief that credit card debt recapitalizes interest as principal each month and caused its automated process of data transfer to allege that the claim consisted of $0.00 in interest, $0.00 in fees, and $575.49 in principal. The UST contends that belief was unreasonable and effectively short-circuited Resurgent's inquiry. The Court need not decide whether that belief was reasonable, and there is no need to make factual findings on these issues after a trial. For the purposes of this decision, the Court assumes, without deciding, that Resurgent violated Rule 9011(b) by failing to make well-supported allegations of principal, interest, and fees on the statement attached to the Cushman POC.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-110\">\n    The UST asserts that, in order to comply with Rule 9011(b), Resurgent must review the billing statements underlying a claim and compare the information in those statements with the information in the proof of claim. To the extent that Resurgent's data string is not designed to capture the kinds of information that must be reported on a proof of claim, the Court agrees. However, the Court is not persuaded that Resurgent should be required to corroborate all of the information reported on the data string by engaging in an independent review of the billing statements in every circumstance. The Court is even less persuaded by the UST's contention that a reasonable inquiry preceding the filing of a proof of claim must involve review of the schedules filed by the debtor. Debtors' schedules may carry evidentiary weight in some contexts.\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.,\n    </em>\n    Fed. R. Bankr. P. 3003(b)(1) (providing that, in a chapter 9 or chapter 11 case, the schedule of liabilities \"shall constitute prima facie evidence of the validity and amount of the claims of creditors, unless they are scheduled as disputed, contingent, or unliquidated\");\n    <em>\n     In re Rehman\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4152947\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/479/238/\">\n     479 B.R. 238\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 244 n.11 (Bankr. D. Mass. 2012) (observing that some courts treat schedules as admissions under Fed. R. Evid. 801(d) ). But that reality does not render a failure to consult schedules when preparing a proof of claim objectively unreasonable. Like other actors who present litigation documents to the Court, Resurgent is entitled to rely on\n    information provided by its affiliates if that reliance is reasonable.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Hadges v.

Some courts have espoused the view that Rule 9011\"does not require steps that are not cost-justified.\"\n    <em>\n     Szabo Food Serv., Inc. v.

If Resurgent were required to corroborate all of the information in the data string by reviewing billing statements and schedules, that would increase the time and money spent on a process that is intended to be simple and inexpensive \"for all parties including creditors.\"\n    <em>\n     Am. Express Bank, FSB v. Askenaizer (In re Plourde)\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4128410\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/418/495/\">\n     418 B.R. 495\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 504 n.12 (1st Cir. BAP 2009). According to Resurgent, reviewing billing statements would do little to improve the accuracy of its proofs of claim because the information in those statements derives from the same source as the information in its data string.\n    <footnotemark>\n     11\n    </footnotemark>\n    The Court is not persuaded that reviewing debtors' schedules would necessarily advance the goal of accuracy in every instance either. There is nothing inherently wrong with a creditor trying to be efficient when it comes to the preparation of proofs of claim. The problem only arises when the price of efficiency is the accuracy of the information in the proof of claim.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-111\">\n    Next, the Court rejects the UST's contention that Resurgent violated Rule 9011 because it did not require its claims processors to review the actual proof of claim form. The Court is convinced that claims processors' review of the BKS screen was the functional equivalent of reviewing the proof of claim form because that screen held the data that was used to populate the form. Reviewing the information on the BKS screen is, as Resurgent observes, similar to reviewing the online fields used to file a proof of claim through the Court's ePOC system, a system that allows a proof of claim to be filed without the filer actually reviewing the proof of claim form. In some respects, a preprinted form like the proof of claim form differs from most pleadings or motions prepared by an attorney. The proof of claim form contains instructions or headings in each field, prompting alphanumeric data entries of a specific nature that can be easily automated for general unsecured proofs of claim. Unlike the preparation of that form, the preparation of pleadings and motions requires legal skill and judgment. To a certain extent, these differences justify a less literal application of Rule 9011's \"read before signing\" requirement to a proof of claim asserting a general unsecured claim.\n    <footnotemark>\n     12\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-112\">\n    At some level, the Rule 9011(b) barometer must be tied to the nature of the litigation paper in question. One of the fundamental purposes of the rules governing proofs of claim is \"to simplify the claims allowance process and provide a fair and inexpensive process for all parties including creditors.\"\n    <em>\n     In re Plourde\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4128410\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/418/495/\">\n     418 B.R. at\n    </extracted-citation>\n    504 n.12 ;\n    <em>\n     accord\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     In re Crutchfield\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4177209\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/492/60/#p68\">\n     492 B.R. 60\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 68 (Bankr. M.D. Ga. 2013). That purpose would not be served by requiring the sort of time- and labor-intensive analysis of the evidentiary basis for the factual allegations in a proof of claim that the UST desires. The notion of reasonableness implies a range of conduct, with ideal processes resting at one end of the range, objectively unreasonable processes resting at the opposite end, and other processes falling in the middle.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Mohammed v. Union Carbide Corp.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3758341\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/606/252/#p261\">\n     606 F.Supp. 252\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 261 (E.D. Mich. 1985) (observing that \"there are many ways by which [a litigant] can reasonably apprise himself of the legitimacy of a claim prior to pursuing it in court\"). In certain respects, Resurgent's process falls somewhere in the middle of the spectrum. In the abstract, it was not unreasonable for Resurgent to rely on an automated process for transferring data to proofs of claim and to require claims processors to review a screenshot of that information for discrepancies identified by a computerized system, as these processes may very well have increased accuracy by minimizing human error. It was, however, objectively unreasonable for Resurgent to rely solely on the data string in populating the Cushman POC when it was required to report a last transaction date and the data string did not contain a last transaction date. In this respect, Resurgent violated Rule 9011(b).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-113\">\n    <strong>\n     iv. The Propriety of Sanctions Under Rule 9011(c)\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-114\">\n    The parties' arguments about the propriety of sanctions under Rule 9011(c) focus on Resurgent's prior practice of affixing Ms. Gaines's signature to all unsecured proofs of claim regardless of who later reviewed them, and Resurgent's prior practice of reviewing those proofs of claim by causing its claims processors to review the BKS screen rather than the form itself. Resurgent contends that it should not be sanctioned under Rule 9011(c) because: (a) its change to its signature practices in 2015 obviated any need for specific deterrence, and the amendment to the proof of claim form in 2016 eliminated any need to generally deter others from signing a proof of claim without personally reviewing it; and (b) there is no evidence that its prior signature practices caused any harm, or that it engaged in those practices in willful violation of the law or with the intent to injure others. Resurgent also argues that it should not be required to amend the Cushman POC because the amended proof of claim would be the same as the one currently on file, and that remedy would be \"tantamount to disallowing\" the claim. The UST responds that Resurgent should be subject to a significant sanction under Rule 9011(c) because it cut costs and \"undermined the foundations of the claims system.\" From the UST's perspective, the instructions on Official Form 10, the settlement of the Maryland proceeding in 2011, and the email sent by Mr. Faliero in 2014 should all have placed Resurgent on notice that its signature practice\n    was improper. The UST also contends that Resurgent should be required to amend the Cushman POC because it contains inaccurate statements of principal, interest, fees, and the last payment and last transaction date, as well as a \"radically incorrect and misleading certification.\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-115\">\n    The Court has already concluded that although Resurgent's prior signature practice may have failed to comport with the instructions on Official Form 10 and run afoul of Rule 3001(a), that practice did not violate Rule 9011(b). Similarly, Resurgent's practice of reviewing the information on the BKS screen rather than the proof of claim form did not contravene Rule 9011(b). Despite the parties' fixation on these particular practices, the Court has determined that Resurgent violated Rule 9011(b) in a different way-by alleging a last transaction date in the Cushman POC that lacked evidentiary support. The Court has also assumed-but not decided-that Resurgent ran afoul of the rule by failing to secure an evidentiary foundation for its allegations of principal, interest, and fees on the statement attached to the proof of claim.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-116\">\n    Neither of these shortcomings warrants the imposition of sanctions under Rule 9011(c) in this proceeding. The statements of principal, interest, fees, and last transaction date are, by design, subsidiary allegations.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Fed. R. Bankr. P. 3001 Advisory Committee Note 2012 (explaining that disclosure of the information required by Rule 3001(c)(3) is intended to help the debtor match the claim with an account). When those allegations are not set forth as required, Rule 3001(c)(2)(D) expressly provides that \"the court\n    <em>\n     may\n    </em>\n    , after notice and a hearing, ... (i) preclude the holder from presenting the omitted information ... unless the court determines that the failure was substantially justified or is harmless; or (ii) award other appropriate relief, including reasonable expenses and attorney's fees caused by the failure.\" Fed. R. Bankr. P. 3001(c)(2)(D) (emphasis added). The unsupported allegations in the Cushman POC do not warrant relief under Rule 3001(c)(2)(D) for several reasons. First, the creditor and account number identified in the proof of claim match a debt scheduled by the Cushmans, and the amount listed on the claim ($575.49) is relatively close to the amount of the scheduled debt ($540.00). Under these circumstances, the allegations at issue could not have interfered with the debtors' ability to identify the claim.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     In re Crutchfield\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4177209\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/492/60/#p68\">\n     492 B.R. at 73\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (determining that certain proofs of claim substantially complied with the spirit of Rule 3001, despite their failure to provide all the information required by the rule, where the missing information did not affect the debtor's ability to identify the claims);\n    <em>\n     cf.\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Banco Popular de P.R. v.

BAP Jan. 19, 2011) (\"The sufficiency of a summary attached to a proof of claim must be analyzed on a case-by-case basis, taking into account the detail provided, the content of the schedules, and the identity of the objector.\"). Second, the claim set forth in the Cushman POC has been allowed and a 100% distribution has already been made. As a result, precluding Resurgent from providing information under Rule 3001(c)(2)(D)(i) would serve no meaningful purpose at this juncture. Third, there is no indication that the unsupported allegations in the Cushman POC caused any loss or damage. As such, there is no \"other appropriate relief\" that might be dispensed under Rule 3001(c)(2)(D)(ii). Because Rule 3001(c)(2)(D) is specifically tailored to remedy noncompliance with the requirements of Rule 3001(c) and those specific remedies are not warranted here, resort to the arsenal of Rule 9011(c) is neither necessary nor appropriate.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     In re Andrews\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3780171\" index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/394/384/\">\n     394 B.R. 384\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (Bankr.

If this is the UST's concern, the concern is understandable. There is no doubt that testing compliance with the proof of claim requirements on a case-by-case basis would be expensive and burdensome, perhaps even prohibitively so. In the right case, a significant sanction designed to remedy harm to the integrity of the bankruptcy system and to provide an effective deterrent could be imposed. In the final analysis, however, the UST has simply not established that this is the right case for that type of sanction.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     In re Freeman-Clay\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12268708\" index=\"120\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/578/423/#p432\">\n     578 B.R. at 443-44\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (declining to impose an inherent power sanction where the conduct at issue was governed by Rule 9011 ).\n    <footnotemark>\n     15\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-125\">\n    <strong>\n     IV. Conclusion\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-126\">\n    Resurgent seeks a declaration that it is not subject to sanctions under Rule 9011, section 105(a), the Court's inherent powers, or \"any other authority\" on account of the Cushman POC. The parties briefed the issue of sanctions under Rule 9011, section 105(a), and the Court's inherent powers. They did not brief the issue of whether sanctions are warranted under some \"other authority.\" As such, the Court deems that aspect of Resurgent's complaint waived. Resurgent is entitled to a summary judgment on its complaint for a declaration that it is not subject to sanctions under Rule 9011, section 105(a), or the Court's inherent powers for filing the Cushman POC, and that it need not amend that proof of claim. A separate order will issue.\n   </p>\n   <footnote label=\"3\">\n    <p id=\"p-131\">\n     Although this statement is not included in the parties' statements of material fact, it is supported by the copies of the data string included in the appendices. The Court is not obliged to consider salient facts that are not isolated by the parties, D. Me. Civ. R. 56(f), but will nevertheless consider the contents of the data string upon which both parties rely extensively.\n    </p>\n   </footnote>\n   <footnote label=\"4\">\n    <p id=\"p-132\">\n     As support for these statements, Resurgent cites a declaration of Bruce Jobe. The UST asks the Court to strike the statements because (a) Mr. Jobe's testimony is excludable under Fed. R. Evid. 1002 ; (b) Mr. Jobe's testimony does not meet the requirements of Fed. R. Evid. 1006 ; and (c) Resurgent did not produce in discovery the agreement under which LVNV acquired the debt described in the Cushman POC. Fed. R. Evid. 1002 is inapplicable to Mr. Jobe's testimony, even though the testimony describes, at some level, the contents of written agreements.\n     <em>\n      See, e.g.,\n     </em>\n     <em>\n      Miner v. Sharp Ford-Mercury, Inc. (In re United Tractors, Inc.)\n     </em>\n     ,\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6532051\" index=\"121\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/13/239/\">\n      13 B.R. 239\n     </extracted-citation>\n     , 244 n.11 (Bankr. W.D. Mo. 1981) (explaining that Fed. R. Evid. 1002\"is not applicable when a witness testifies from personal knowledge of a matter, even though the same information is contained in a writing\") (quotation marks omitted). Fed. R. Evid. 1006 authorizes the use of summaries to prove the content of voluminous writings. It does not, however, preclude a witness with personal knowledge from testifying about a party's business practices relating to writings generally. Finally, even if the Court were to grant the UST's requests to strike these statements based on the claimed evidentiary deficiencies of Mr. Jobe's declaration, the statements are adequately supported by the declaration of Jon Mazzoli, Director of Deal Management at Resurgent's affiliate, Sherman Capital Markets, LLC. The UST has not challenged Mr. Mazzoli's declaration, and the statements in that declaration establish that Resurgent and its affiliates routinely secure contractual representations and warranties regarding the validity of purchased accounts and receivables and the material accuracy of the information related to those accounts and receivables. In fact, Resurgent has produced the agreement transferring the receivables underlying the Cushman POC, an agreement containing representations and warranties as to the validity of the debt. For these reasons, the UST's requests to strike are denied.\n    </p>\n   </footnote>\n   <footnote label=\"5\">\n    <p id=\"p-133\">\n     The UST asks the Court to strike this statement on the grounds that the statement is immaterial and lacks record support because (a) the declaration of Bruce Jobe, offered in support of the statement, is excludable under Fed. R. Evid. 1002 and 1006 ; and (b) Resurgent has failed to produce the purchase agreement for the Cushman debt. For the reasons described in the previous footnote, the Court rejects the UST's contention that this statement lacks record support. The Court also declines to strike this statement as immaterial.\n    </p>\n   </footnote>\n   <footnote label=\"6\">\n    <p id=\"p-134\">\n     When the summary judgment motions were filed in this adversary proceeding, Resurgent and the United States Trustee Program (\"USTP\") were litigating the issue of whether Resurgent should be sanctioned for its prior proof of claim signing and filing practices in three different bankruptcy courts: the District of Maine, the Western District of Missouri, and the Northern District of Texas. Resurgent asserts that, during settlement negotiations, it rejected the USTP's \"take it or leave it\" demand that Resurgent pay a significant sum to the USTP and withdraw or amend every pending proof of claim that had been filed by Ms. Gaines without her personal review. SMF \u00b6 83. The UST asks the Court to strike the statement because it is excludable under Fed. R. Evid. 408 and because it is not relevant to the question of whether Resurgent should be sanctioned. The UST's request is granted on both grounds.\n    </p>\n   </footnote>\n   <footnote label=\"7\">\n    <p id=\"p-135\">\n     Civil Rule 56 must be followed scrupulously, but the Court will not apply it slavishly at the expense of Civil Rule 1.\n     <em>\n      Cf.\n     </em>\n     <em>\n      Ricci v.

Fed. R. Bankr. P. 9011(c)(1)(A). Resurgent has expressly waived the protections of the safe harbor in this proceeding.\n    </p>\n   </footnote>\n   <footnote label=\"9\">\n    <p id=\"p-137\">\n     Even if Ms. Gaines somehow violated Rule 9011 by allowing her employer to affix her signature or, if Resurgent violated Rule 9011 by affixing Ms. Gaines's signature to proofs of claim she had not reviewed, Resurgent has ceased that practice. Since the filing of the Cushman POC, Resurgent has implemented a practice that requires a claims processor to personally sign a proof of claim after review and prior to filing. Resurgent commenced its efforts to change the challenged signature practices before learning of the USTP's discovery motions in the cases in the Western District of Missouri. While Resurgent could have initiated this change earlier, or completed and implemented it more quickly, the change was nevertheless voluntary. Because of this new practice, sanctions would not be necessary to deter Resurgent from continuing its prior practice. Since the filing of the Cushman POC, the proof of claim form has also been amended to expressly state that the individual signing the form has \"examined the information in [the] Proof of Claim[.]\" Official Form 410. In light of this amendment, sanctions would not be necessary to deter other similarly situated parties from engaging in conduct similar to Resurgent's former signature practice.\n    </p>\n   </footnote>\n   <footnote label=\"10\">\n    <p id=\"p-138\">\n     Neither the parties' stipulation nor their statements of material fact identify when Resurgent received the billing statements. Those materials simply indicate that Resurgent sometimes received billing statements with the data string; Resurgent could request billing statements if it did not receive them with the data string; and Resurgent produced billing statements for the Cushman POC in the course of this proceeding.\n    </p>\n   </footnote>\n   <footnote label=\"11\">\n    <p id=\"p-139\">\n     Perhaps Resurgent is right about that, perhaps not. Either way, a de facto requirement that a creditor or servicer review billing statements before filing a proof of claim for a debt arising out of the use of a credit card would seem to frustrate Rule 3001(c) at some level. Rule 3001(c) provides that, in most circumstances, when a claim is based on a writing, the writing must be attached to the proof of claim. Fed. R. Bankr. P. 3001(c)(1). There is, however, an exception to this requirement for claims based on an open-end or revolving consumer credit agreement.\n     <em>\n      See\n     </em>\n     Fed. R. Bankr. P. 3001(c)(1), (3). Because the rules do not require a revolving consumer credit agreement to be attached to the proof of claim, it would make little sense for the Court to fashion an unwritten and unbending rule that the agreement, or the billing statements related to the agreement, must be inspected before the proof of claim is filed.\n    </p>\n   </footnote>\n   <footnote label=\"12\">\n    <p id=\"p-140\">\n     The point made here is a narrow one: a person who reviews a computer screen showing information that the person knows will be used to populate fields on the proof of claim form in a reliable, predictable way, can be said to have \"read\" the proof of claim form as long as the person has independent familiarity with the actual form. In these limited circumstances, there is little to be gained by imposing a requirement that the person's eyes pass over the actual proof of claim form. Whether the same is true for a proof of claim asserting a secured claim or a priority claim is left for determination another day.\n    </p>\n   </footnote>\n   <footnote label=\"13\">\n    <p id=\"p-141\">\n     Resurgent theorizes that the authority provided by section 105(a) is coextensive with the Court's inherent authority.
