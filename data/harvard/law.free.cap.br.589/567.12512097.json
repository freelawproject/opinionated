It is not reasonable to expect creditors to scrutinize ninety-three single-spaced lines of visually identical typeface in search of a Nonstandard Provision that might apply to them. Further, many of the Nonstandard Provisions are so poorly drafted that their intended meaning and application are indiscernible. While it is true that creditors are obligated to read the plan, \"it is equally true that the relief being sought must be articulated clearly and, particularly if it is unusual relief, conspicuously set forth in the text-that is to say, not 'buried' among boilerplate provisions.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Rheaume\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"344006\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/296/313/#p321\">\n    296 B.R. 313\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 321 (Bankr.

The court of appeals ruled that the plan language was not specific enough to invoke the court's enforcement authority: \"[T]here was no language in Nosek's Plan, as it was confirmed, or in \u00a7 1322(b), that addressed how Ameriquest was to apply the payments it received from Nosek or from the trustee.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3841538,3937069\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/544/34/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3841538,3937069\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/544/34/\">\n    at 49\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   The action in\n   <em>\n    Nosek\n   </em>\n   was brought during the pendency of the case for the creditor's alleged violation of \u00a7 1322(b), which lists the permitted elements of a plan, and for violation of the plan itself.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3841538,3937069\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/544/34/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3841538,3937069\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/544/34/\">\n    at 37\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But the court's reasoning could apply equally in a post-discharge action under \u00a7 524(i).

Application-of-payments provisions in particular appeared to be a prudent precaution. In cases decided mostly after\n   <em>\n    Nosek\n   </em>\n   , bankruptcy courts considering application-of-payments provisions in chapter 13 plans were split on their propriety.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Poff\n   </em>\n   , No. 11-15869,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012%20WL%207991472\">\n    2012 WL 7991472\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *6 (Bankr.

Effective Dec. 1, 2011, the Bankruptcy Rules were amended, and Rule 3002.1 was added \"to aid in the implementation of \u00a7 1322(b)(5), which permits a chapter 13 debtor to cure a default and maintain payments on a home mortgage over the course of the debtor's plan.\" Fed. R. Bankr. P. 3002.1 advisory committee's note to 2011 amendment. The focus of Rule 3002.1 is notice. At the same time, Rule 3001 was also amended with a new paragraph (c)(2), which requires additional supporting information in proofs of claim in an individual debtor case. Together, Rule 3002.1 and Rule 3001(c)(2) obviate whatever need there once might have been not only for application-of-payments provisions but also for provisions related to other home mortgage payment disputes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   B.

Fed. R. Bankr. P. 3002.1(f). The creditor must then respond with a statement indicating whether it agrees the default has been cured and whether the debtor is current on all payments, including an itemization of any amounts the creditor contends have not been paid. Fed. R. Bankr. P. 3002.1(g). If the creditor's accounting differs from the Trustee's, either the Trustee or the debtor may file a motion asking the court to determine whether the default has been cured and all required postpetition amounts have been paid. Fed. R. Bankr. P. 3002.1(h). This procedure ensures that if the creditor has misapplied payments under the plan, the court will consider the issue before discharge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   2. Additional Fees or Charges Based on Prepetition Default\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Even before the Rules amendments, courts recognized that additional charges based on a prepetition default violated the Code.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Collins\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2007%20WL%202116416\">\n    2007 WL 2116416\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *14 (\"Any post-petition assessment of late fees and charges on the prepetition arrearage is not authorized by \u00a7 1322(b)(5).\") Now, individual debtors have procedural protections as well. Rule 3001 requires that any charges incurred prepetition be itemized and filed with the proof of claim. Fed. R. Bankr. P. 3001(c)(2)(A). Consequently, any improper postpetition charges based on a prepetition default will be identifiable as missing from that itemization and may be disputed under Rule 3002.1(h).

Section 1306 Plan\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   A provision paraphrasing \u00a7 1306, which specifies the property included in the estate, \"does not enhance the efficiency of the administration of the case or the rights of either debtors or creditors.\"\n   <em>\n    Maupin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3764928\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/384/421/#p432\">\n    384 B.R. at 427\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Here, the Section 1306 Plan provision not only restates \u00a7 1306 but also identifies vesting events: \"All property ... shall vest in the debtor only upon dismissal, discharge, or conversion.\" This sentence is a verbatim restatement of the district's previous form confirmation order, now replaced by the form implemented at the same time as the Mississippi Form Plan.

The Section 1306 Plan provision is therefore not approved.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   B. Co-Debtor Stay\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   The Bankruptcy Code does not specify who must receive notice before termination of the co-debtor stay.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201301\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1301\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c) (stating generally \"after notice and a hearing\"). The Local Rules, however, ensure that co-debtors receive notice.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Miss. Bankr. L.R. 4001-1(a)(1) (requiring service of motion for relief from stay \"on any entity ... that will be affected by the relief requested\"); Miss. Bankr. L.R. 9013-1(b)(2)(C) (requiring service of any motion on \"entities affected by the relief requested\"). The Co-Debtor Stay provision is therefore not approved.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   C. If the Stay Is Lifted as to Secured Property\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   To the extent this Nonstandard Provision accurately describes the rights of secured creditors that have been granted relief from the stay, it restates the law. To the extent it unilaterally sets deadlines for certain creditor actions, it goes beyond the law. \"Debtors cannot, by fiat, impose law which would otherwise not apply.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Anderson\n   </em>\n   , 382 B.R. at 504 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Visintainer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3770706\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/435/727/#p729\">\n    435 B.R. at 728\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (refusing to reconsider rejection of twenty-five paragraphs of boilerplate provisions, including one setting deadlines for secured creditors to file deficiency claims);\n   <em>\n    Maupin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3764928\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/384/421/#p432\">\n    384 B.R. at 427\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"If the Debtor believes that such a provision should be included in any order granting relief from the stay, the court will consider requiring it at the hearing on the motion for relief from the stay.\"). This Nonstandard Provision is not approved.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   D. Credit Reporting\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   The Bankruptcy Code neither prescribes nor proscribes how creditors\n   report debtors' account information to credit reporting agencies. In that context, what does it mean that \"such reports shall be consistent with the terms and provisions of [the confirmed] plan,\" as this Nonstandard Provision requires? According to the debtor in one case, a similar provision meant that confirmation required the creditor to report the current balance of the debt as zero.\n   <em>\n    In re Jones\n   </em>\n   , No. 09-14499-BFK,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2011%20WL%205025329\">\n    2011 WL 5025329\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4 (Bankr. E.D. Va. Oct. 21, 2011). The court observed that the debtor's position was \"at odds with the weight of authority,\" held that the provision was ambiguous, and denied the debtor's contempt motion.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *4-5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   The\n   <em>\n    Jones\n   </em>\n   case is instructive. If the Credit Reporting provision is ambiguous, it will not accomplish what the Debtor intends-whatever that might be. If it is not ambiguous, to the extent it conflicts with the law, the Credit Reporting provision is not permitted; to the extent it accurately states the law, it is unnecessary. In any event, it is not approved.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   E. Revocation of Consent to Telephone Communication or Contact\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   The first sentence of this Nonstandard Provision is an abridgement of the provision on Arbitration and Alternative Dispute Resolution, the defects of which are examined in Section V below. The second and third sentences \"reject[ ] as an executory contract any prior authorization\" for phone calls by \"parties in interest with such provisions.\" Aside from the fact the Debtor has no executory contracts, this Nonstandard Provision conflicts with the Standing Stay Modification provision, which would allow creditor contact for certain purposes. Aside from both those facts, this sentence misstates the law; an authorization for creditors' calls is not an executory contract.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Phoenix Expl., Inc. v. Yaquinto (In re Murexco Petroleum, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1527393,6121175\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/15/60/\">\n    15 F.3d 60\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 62 (5th Cir. 1994) (\"[T]he relevant inquiry [in determining the existence of an executory contract] is whether performance remains due to some extent on both sides.\"). Further, all collection-related contacts by prepetition creditors are subject to the automatic stay.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20362\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 362\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(6). This Nonstandard Provision is not approved.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   F. Jurisdiction for Non-Core Matters\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   This Nonstandard Provision conflicts with the law and the Local Rules. Although litigants may impliedly consent to the bankruptcy court's adjudication of noncore proceedings, \"[i]t bears emphasizing ... [that the consent] must still be\n   <em>\n    knowing and voluntary\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    Wellness Int'l Network, Ltd. v. Sharif\n   </em>\n   , --- U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4161832\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/1932/#p1948\">\n    135 S.Ct. 1932\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1948,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=191%20L.%20Ed.%202d%20911\">\n    191 L.Ed.2d 911\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2015) (emphasis added). A litigant's consent is neither knowing nor voluntary where, as here, the waiver is drafted by a potentially adverse party, applies universally to all noncore proceedings and \"all creditors or other parties\" listed in the bankruptcy schedules, and is included as one of many boilerplate provisions listed in no logical order in the Nonstandard Plan Provisions section of a chapter 13 plan. The Local Rules prescribe what constitutes knowing and voluntary consent and waiver.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Miss. Bankr. L.R. 7008-1, 7012-1(b). This Nonstandard Provision is not approved.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   G. Escrow or Interest Rate Change\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   This Nonstandard Provision obliquely references creditors' notice obligations under Rule 3002.1(b) and (c). It is unnecessary and therefore not approved.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   <strong>\n    VI. Three Nonstandard Provisions Either Partially Reject Executory Contracts or Improperly Sever Contract Provisions.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   The Arbitration and Alternative Dispute Resolution provision, the Choice of\n   Law provision, and the Choice of Venue provision are \"abstract attempts to selectively void or amend ... contractual provisions as offensive to this debtor,\"\n   <em>\n    In re Booth\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3285513\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/399/316/#p329\">\n    399 B.R. at 329\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (rejecting provisions including one nearly identical to Arbitration and Alternative Dispute Resolution here). To the extent the Arbitration and Alternative Dispute Resolution provision partially rejects executory contracts, it conflicts with bankruptcy law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Stewart Title Guar. Co. v. Old Republic Nat'l Title Ins. Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6465505,11644771\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/83/735/\">\n    83 F.3d 735\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 741 (5th Cir. 1996) (\"[A]n executory contract must be assumed or rejected in its entirety.\") To the extent all three Nonstandard Provisions sever contract provisions-relief requiring an adversary proceeding-they \"unilaterally and impermissibly alter creditors' rights,\"\n   <em>\n    In re Solitro\n   </em>\n   , 382 B.R. at 152. They are not approved.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   <strong>\n    VII. Only the Standing Stay Modification Is an Appropriate Nonstandard Provision.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   Modifying the automatic stay to permit non-collection-related contacts by secured creditors is an appropriate provision under \u00a7 1322(b)(11) because it waives only the debtor's rights under the Code. Another court has even suggested sua sponte that plans include a provision like this, specific to mortgage claims.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Aldrich\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2008%20WL%204185989\">\n    2008 WL 4185989\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   The Standing Stay Modification is therefore approved, but only to the extent it is specific to the Debtor and accurately states the law. Accordingly, because the Debtor is making no direct payments, the clause beginning \"and if there are direct payments\" is not approved. And the sentence, \"Such actions do not constitute violations of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20362\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 362\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a),\" is not approved because it misstates the law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   <strong>\n    ORDER\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   With the exception of the Standing Stay Modification, the Nonstandard Provisions render the Plan unconfirmable under \u00a7 1325(a)(1). The Trustee's Objection to Confirmation is therefore\n   <strong>\n    ORDERED SUSTAINED\n   </strong>\n   and Confirmation is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   .
