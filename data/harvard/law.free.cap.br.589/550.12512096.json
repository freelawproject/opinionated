Having considered the matter and being fully advised in the premises, the Court finds as follows:\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    Jurisdiction\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   This Court has jurisdiction over the parties to and the subject matter of the Adversary pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201334\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1334\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Sunbelt Fruit &amp; Vegetable Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1537798\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/336/410/#p412\">\n    336 F.3d 410\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 412 (5th Cir. 2003). Most of the following facts are taken from the Complaint Objecting to Discharge (the \"Adversary Complaint\") (Adv. Dkt. 1) filed by Barbara.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Barbara and Roger Martin Parker (\"Roger\") married in 1982; they had two children (the \"Parker Children\") (Adv. Dkt. 19-1 at 2). Roger hired April as a part-time bookkeeper for a farming business. (Adv. Dkt. 1-1 at 1-2). In 2004, Roger and April began an adulterous affair which continued uninterrupted until December 3, 2011, when Roger separated from Barbara and the Parker Children. (Adv. Dkt. 19-1 at 2). Shortly thereafter, Roger filed a complaint for divorce in the Chancery Court of Lamar County, Mississippi (the \"Chancery Court\"), styled\n   <em>\n    Roger Parker v. Barbara Parker\n   </em>\n   , Cause No. 2012-0536-GN-DO. Barbara filed an answer and counterclaim seeking a divorce from Roger on grounds of adultery. (Adv. Dkt. 19-1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   During the pendency of the divorce proceedings, Barbara commenced an action against April in the Circuit Court of Lamar County, Mississippi (the \"Circuit Court\"), styled\n   <em>\n    Barbara Bond Parker v. April F. Williamson Miller\n   </em>\n   , Civil Action No. 2012-165 (the \"Circuit Court Action\"), on November 29, 2012. (Adv. Dkt. 1 at 1). In the Complaint for Alienation of Affection, Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress, Accounting and Other Relief (the \"Circuit Court Complaint\") (Adv. Dkt. 1-1), Barbara asserted causes of action against April for: (a) fraud; (b) embezzlement; (c) intentional infliction of emotional distress; and (d) alienation of affection. (Adv. Dkt. 1\n   at 1-2). The allegations in the Circuit Court Complaint are nonspecific, but in general, Barbara asserted that Roger, April, and April's mother (who she did not identify by name) had conspired to defraud her of her share of the marital estate. (Adv. Dkt. 1-1). Barbara asked the Circuit Court to order an accounting for any funds transferred from any account that belonged to Roger and/or Barbara; to impress a lien on the real property owned by April's mother to the extent of the cost of any improvements; to award her compensatory and punitive damages in excess of $75,000.00; and to enjoin April from transferring any assets until a full and complete accounting was completed. (Adv. Dkt. 1-1 at 6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In the divorce action, the Chancery Court dismissed Roger's complaint for divorce on March 26, 2014. (Adv. Dkt. 19-1 at 1). A hearing was held on Barbara's counterclaim for divorce on November 4, 2014. (Adv. Dkt. 19-1 at 1). In the Final Judgment of Divorce, entered on November 13, 2014, the Chancery Court granted Barbara a divorce from Roger on grounds of adultery as set forth in \u00a7 93-5-1 of the Mississippi Code. (Adv. Dkt. 19-1 at 2). The Chancery Court found that Barbara and Roger had agreed to a settlement of all property rights between them and, accordingly, incorporated into the Final Judgment of Divorce the Child Custody, Support and Property Settlement Agreement (the \"PSA\") (Adv. Dkt. 19-1 at 5-16) signed by them on November 4, 2014.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In the meantime, a jury trial in the Circuit Court Action was set to begin on October 31, 2017. (Adv. Dkt. 8 at 9). On October 28, 2017, however, April filed a petition for relief (the \"Petition\") (Bankr. Dkt. 1) under chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   As a result, the automatic stay under \u00a7 362(a) went into effect and stayed the Circuit Court Action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In her bankruptcy schedules, April listed total liabilities of $188,154.00 and assets of $16,958.00. (Bankr. Dkt. 9 at 1). The two largest debts that April listed in her bankruptcy schedules are: (a) loans made by Roger in the aggregate amount of $77,000.00, which she described as unliquidated and disputed, and (b) Barbara's tort claims in the amount of $75,000.00, which she similarly described as contingent, unliquidated, and disputed. (Bankr. Dkt. 9 at 14 &amp; 16). In Amended Schedule J: Your Expenses (\"Schedule J\") (Bankr. Dkt. 36), April indicated that she has no \"dependents\" but that her household expenses include those of individuals other than herself.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On November 1, 2017, Barbara filed the Notice of Removal (Dist. Ct. Dkt. 1) in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Mississippi (the \"District Court\") styled,\n   <em>\n    Barbara Bond Parker v. April F. Williamson Miller\n   </em>\n   , Civil Action No. 2:17-cv-00190-KS-MTP, for the stated purpose of transferring the Circuit Court Action to this Court for consolidation with the not-yet-filed Adversary. To that end, Barbara filed the Plaintiff's Motion to Transfer Cause to Bankruptcy Court (Dist. Ct. Dkt. 2) on November 22, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   April filed the Response to Notice of Removal and Motion to Remand (the \"Motion to Remand\") (Dist. Ct. Dkt. 9) on December 20, 2017; and Barbara filed the Plaintiff's Response in Opposition to Defendant's Motion to Remand (Dist. Ct. Dkt. 13) on December 22, 2017. Finally, on January 10, 2018, April filed the Debtor's Rebuttal to Plaintiff's Response to Motion\n   to Remand (Dist. Ct. Dkt. 14). On February 20, 2018, the District Court entered the Memorandum Opinion and Order (the \"District Court Order\") (Dist. Ct. Dkt. 15; Adv. Dkt. 19-2), granting the Motion to Remand. The District Court reasoned that since April had no assets to distribute to creditors in the Bankruptcy Case, any potential judgment-regardless of the outcome-could not possibly affect the bankruptcy estate. The District Court ordered that the \"case ... immediately be remanded to the Circuit Court of Lamar County, Mississippi.\" (Adv. Dkt. 19-2 at 3-4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Before the entry of the District Court Order, Barbara filed the Adversary Complaint on January 30, 2018, in which she asked this Court to deny the dischargeability of the debt owed to her by April under \u00a7 523 as well as to deny April's discharge under \u00a7 727. As to the dischargeability of the debt, Barbara alleged that her claims against April for fraud, embezzlement, alienation of affection, and intentional infliction of emotional distress are not dischargeable in the Bankruptcy Case pursuant to \u00a7 523. Barbara did not specify, however, which one of the nineteen (19) sub-subsections of \u00a7 523(a) applies to April's debt.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   She incorporated by reference the facts and claims set forth in the Circuit Court Complaint, a copy of which she attached to the Adversary Complaint.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Adv. Dkt. 1 at 2). These facts are summarized as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    a. Fraud\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   Roger withdrew cash from joint accounts, individual accounts, or a business account for the benefit of April and April's mother.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   In 2008, Roger arranged for April and her children to be housed in a \"rental home\" that he jointly owned with Barbara.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   From 2008 until May, 2011, Roger and April engaged in a fraudulent scheme whereby Roger deposited $500.00 per month into a checking account jointly owned by Roger and Barbara, ostensibly representing rental payments. During this same period, Roger paid for April's utility expenses in excess of $9,700.00.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   Roger purchased a mobile home, paid for improvements to the mobile home and to real property owned by April's mother, and bought automobiles, tires, and other unknown property for April's benefit.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   April extorted funds from Roger or obtained funds from him by forging checks or writing unauthorized checks. Roger wrote checks payable to: (a) April and her children in excess of $150,000.00; (b) a credit card company for a card associated with April and April's mother in the amount of $54,000.00; and (c) April's mother in the amount of $12,400.00.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   (Adv. Dkt. 1-1 at 2-3).\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    b. Embezzlement\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   April committed fraud and embezzlement by taking funds of the marital estate from Roger and his business.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   (Adv. Dkt. 1-1 at 3).\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    c. Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress\n   </strong>\n   As an employee at Roger's farming business, April was familiar with Barbara and the Parker Children. She nonetheless engaged in conduct and activities that were illegal and adulterous for approximately seven (7) years \"until such time as Roger left the marriage at the apparent insistence of [April] due to her alleged addiction to illegal drugs and her need of his financial assistance and support which she demanded in the presence of Roger's sons.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   Because of April's conduct, Barbara and the Parker Children suffered emotional distress.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   (Adv. Dkt. 1-1 at 4-5).\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    d. Alienation of Affection\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   April intentionally, negligently, and recklessly alienated the affection of Roger from Barbara.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   As a result, Barbara suffered damage to the affection and consortium with Roger and also damage to the Parker Children's normal day-to-day relationship with their father.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   (Adv. Dkt. 1-1 at 4-5).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   As to April's discharge, Barbara alleges that April knowingly and fraudulently \"made a false oath or account\" and \"presented or used a false claim.\" (Adv. Dkt. 1 at 2). Although she does not cite the relevant subsection of \u00a7 727 in the Adversary Complaint, her claims for relief track the wording of \u00a7 727(a)(4): \"The court shall grant the debtor a discharge, unless ... the debtor knowingly and fraudulently, in or in connection with the case-(A) made a false oath or account; [or] (B) presented or used a false claim.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20727\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 727\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(4)(A)-(B). In support of her \u00a7 727(a)(4)(A) claim, implied from her allegations, Barbara maintains that April identified two (2) household members in her bankruptcy schedules, but at the meeting of creditors held pursuant to \u00a7 341 on December 1, 2017 (the \"Meeting of Creditors\")\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Bankr. Dkt. 6), April stated that she is single with no dependents. (Adv. Dkt. 1 at 2). In support of her \u00a7 727(a)(4)(B) claim, also implied from her allegations, she contends that April listed in her bankruptcy schedules a debt to Roger in the amount of $77,000.00 for repayment of loans but acknowledged at the Meeting of Creditors that she had no \"written confirmation\" of any such debt. (Adv. Dkt. 1 at 2). Additionally, as to both of her \u00a7 727 claims, she alleges that April filed the Petition only three (3) days before the scheduled jury trial of the Circuit Court Action and that April admitted at the Meeting of Creditors that she had not received any collection notices before filing the Petition, that no judgments had been rendered against her, and that she was able to pay her debts as they became due. (Adv. Dkt. 1 at 2-3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   On March 28, 2018, April filed the Motion to Dismiss alleging that the Adversary Complaint fails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. April contends in the Motion to Dismiss, in general, that: (a) the Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction over any claims that Roger or the Parker Children allegedly have against her; (b) Barbara lacks standing and/or capacity to assert claims belonging to Roger, the Parker Children, or the marital estate; (c) the doctrines of res judicata, release, and/or accord and satisfaction preclude any claims that refer or relate to the marital estate; (d) the Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction over any claims that the marital estate may have against her; (e) Barbara failed to join additional, necessary parties as contemplated\n   by Rule 7019 of the Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure ; (f) the relief sought by Barbara is barred by the equitable defense of laches, consent, acquiescence, and waiver; (g) the claims and allegations in the Circuit Court Complaint may not be incorporated into this Court by reference; (h) the claims in the Adversary Complaint that refer or relate to fraud are not stated with particularity as required by Rule 9 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (\"Rule 9\"), as made applicable to adversary proceedings by Rule 7009 of the Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure ; (i) the Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction over the alienation of affection claim; and (j) some or all of the claims in the Adversary Complaint are barred by the statute of limitations. (Adv. Dkt. 8 at 5-6). Barbara filed the Response to Motion to Dismiss on April 20, 2018, in which she alleges that personal and subject matter jurisdiction are proper based on the pending Petition. (Adv. Dkt. 13 at 3). She also clarifies that the claims against April arise out of her own direct claims and are not claims asserted on behalf of the marital estate, which she admits is not a separate entity under Mississippi family law but, rather, is a fictitious \"pot.\" (Adv. Dkt. 13 at 4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   On May 17, 2018, April filed the Reply in Support of Motion to Dismiss to which she attached a copy of the Final Judgment of Divorce (Adv. Dkt. 19-1) and the District Court Order (Adv. Dkt. 19-2). She points out that Barbara failed to address her contention that Barbara lacks standing to assert claims belonging to Roger, the Parker Children, or the marital estate. (Adv. Dkt. 19 at 2-4). As to the marital estate, she also points out that under Mississippi law, marital property is \"any property acquired or value created by a spouse's efforts during a marriage\" but that a temporary order or final judgment \"creates a point of demarcation with respect to the parties and their estates.\" (Adv. Dkt. 19 at 3) (citing DEBORAH H. BELL, BELL ON MISSISSIPPI FAMILY LAW \u00a7 6.02[2];\n   <em>\n    Godwin v. Godwin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11511383\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/758/384/#p386\">\n    758 So.2d 384\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 386 (Miss. 1999) ). April thus asserts that the marital estate of Barbara and Roger ended when the Final Judgment of Divorce was rendered in 2014 so that no claim on behalf of the marital estate survived after that date, as made clear by various language in the PSA, such as, that \"the parties hereto have made a settlement of all property rights between themselves and that said [PSA] and the provisions contained [therein] are full, adequate, sufficient and complete ... [and are] binding and obligatory upon the parties ....\" (Adv. Dkt. 19 at 3). April then posits that the PSA released all claims that Barbara had against Roger that refer or relate to her conduct. April contends that under the PSA, Barbara cannot assert any claims belonging to Roger in the absence of a written assignment and that so far Barbara has not produced a contract assigning Roger's claims to her. (Adv. Dkt. 19 at 4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   On May 18, 2018, Barbara filed the Motion to Strike, arguing that the Reply in Support of Motion to Dismiss contains new arguments not raised in the original Motion to Dismiss and that the Final Judgment of Divorce and District Court Order attached to the Reply in Support of Motion to Dismiss are matters outside of the pleadings precluded from consideration. (Adv. Dkt. 20 at 1). Barbara asks the Court to \"strike\" the exhibits and to ignore any arguments that reference them. On June 5, 2018, April filed the Response to Motion to Strike, denying that the Reply in Support of Motion to Dismiss contains any new arguments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   In the Response to Motion to Dismiss, Barbara did not invoke Rule 15(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure as made\n   applicable to adversary proceedings by Rule 7015 of the Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure. At the conclusion of the Hearing, however, counsel for Barbara made a motion\n   <em>\n    ore tenus\n   </em>\n   for permission to amend the Adversary Complaint should the Court find her allegations insufficient to state a claim for relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <strong>\n    Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   In support of her request for the dismissal of the Adversary Complaint, April relies on Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (\"Rule 12(b)(6)\"), as made applicable to adversary proceedings by Rule 7012(b) of the Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure. The purpose of Rule 12(b)(6) is to test the formal sufficiency of a claim for relief rather than the substantive merits of the case. 5B CHARLES ALAN WRIGHT &amp; ARTHUR R. MILLER, FEDERAL PRACTICE &amp; PROCEDURE \u00a7 1356 (3d ed. 2004). Mindful of that purpose, the Court addresses the claims for relief under \u00a7 523 and \u00a7 727 in the Adversary Complaint separately.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <strong>\n    A. \u00a7 523(a)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Because April questions whether the Court may consider certain documents in deciding the Motion to Dismiss, the Court considers first the Motion to Strike. The Court does so in the context of its discussion of Barbara's \u00a7 523 claims because the documents that April asks the Court to \"strike\" relate solely to those claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   In deciding a Rule 12(b)(6) motion, a court generally may not \"go outside the complaint.\"\n   <em>\n    Rodriguez v. Rutter\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3877885\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/310/623/#p626\">\n    310 F.

If a court considers matters beyond the four corners of the complaint, it must treat the motion to dismiss as a motion for summary judgment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   FED. R. CIV. P 12(d) (as adopted by FED. R. BANKR. P. 7012(b) ). There are numerous exceptions to this general rule, however. For example, it is well settled that a court may consider documents attached to a motion to dismiss or a response to that motion when they are referred to in the complaint and are central to a plaintiff's claims.\n   <em>\n    Vanderbrook v. Unitrin Preferred Ins. Co. (In re Katrina Canal Breaches Litig.)\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3562499\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/495/191/#p205\">\n    495 F.3d 191\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 205 (5th Cir. 2007) (citing\n   <em>\n    Causey v.

A court also may consider matters of public record,\n   <em>\n    Cinel v.

The Court, therefore, denies the Motion to Strike and considers these documents in determining the sufficiency of the \u00a7 523 claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Often, a creditor brings a dischargeability action after civil litigation already has taken place in another forum and asks the bankruptcy court to adjudicate the dischargeability of the judgment entered in that other forum. Sometimes, however, a creditor brings a dischargeability action in bankruptcy court before any determination of liability or damages. That is the posture of this Adversary: Barbara initially filed her state-law claims against April in Circuit Court, but April's bankruptcy filing stayed the Circuit Court Action before the entry of a final judgment, and then Barbara filed this Adversary. Because a bankruptcy court cannot declare\n   a debt nondischargeable until the creditor establishes the existence and amount of that debt, this Adversary is the type of dischargeability action that involves a two-step process: (1) the establishment of the debt and (2) a determination of the dischargeability of that debt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   As the first step in her \u00a7 523 action, Barbara asks this Court to liquidate her state-law claims and enter a monetary judgment against April.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Morrison v.

In summary, Barbara asserts fraud claims against April, alleging that April acted in concert with Roger to deprive Barbara of her share of the marital estate. Barbara also contends that April embezzled funds from Roger and/or his business. She seeks damages for intentional infliction of emotional distress that April's conduct caused both her and the Parker Children. Finally, she asserts a claim for alienation of affection.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   In the Motion to Dismiss, April raises a myriad of defenses to Barbara's state-law claims. April interprets Barbara's allegations in the Circuit Court Complaint, which were incorporated into the Adversary Complaint, as asserting claims on behalf of Roger, the Parker Children, and the marital estate. April then questions this Court's subject matter jurisdiction and Barbara's standing to pursue such claims. She invokes the doctrines of res judicata, release, and accord and satisfaction and argues that the allegations of fraud are not stated with particularity as required by Rule 9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   At the Hearing, counsel for April articulated these defenses with greater clarity.

Among the jurisdictional provisions of title 28 are several special provisions that apply to personal injury tort claims. For example, \u00a7 157(b)(5) to title 28 provides that \"[t]he district court shall order that personal injury tort claims ... shall be tried in the district court in which the bankruptcy case is pending ....\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20157\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 157\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(5).

Although the District Court Order was not entered in a subsequent stage of the Adversary, the law of the case doctrine nevertheless counsels this Court not to issue a different finding from the District Court as to which forum should try Barbara's state-law claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   For all of the above reasons, the Court concludes,\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   , that cause exists under \u00a7 362(d)(1) to modify the automatic stay, so that Barbara may liquidate her state-law claims in Circuit Court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20105\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 105\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) (\"No provision of this title providing for the raising of an issue by a party in interest shall be construed to preclude the court from, sua sponte, taking any action or making any determination necessary or appropriate to enforce or implement court orders or rules, or to prevent an abuse of process.\"). The pending Circuit Court Action is far advanced and involves a jury trial, and, therefore, as a practical matter, the Court agrees with the District Court that the Circuit Court is the better place to resolve the state-law claims.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Pedro\n   </em>\n   , No. 11-21071,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2011%20WL%203741504\">\n    2011 WL 3741504\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *8 (Bankr.

In that regard, the Court suggests\n   that the parties attempt to ensure that any jury verdict is clear with respect to the standards of nondischargeability under \u00a7 523(a), given that this Court's determination of dischargeability will be based in part or in whole on the record in the Circuit Court Action under principles of collateral estoppel.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cross Point Church v.

There are, however, a total of nineteen (19) sub-subsections in \u00a7 523(a) setting forth categories of nondischargeable debts, but Barbara has failed to specify in the Adversary Complaint which category applies to April's debt.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20523\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1)-(19).

Other exceptions to discharge could potentially apply, such as those that involve debts traceable to fraud, but Barbara's allegations do not neatly track the language of any particular category. It is beyond the role of this Court to speculate about which discharge exception Barbara intended to apply, and the Adversary Complaint fails to provide fair notice to April of the grounds of Barbara's dischargeability claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   The Court does not hold that all dischargeability claims must cite the specific sub-subsection in \u00a7 523(a) in order to survive a Rule 12(b)(6) challenge. In some instances, the facts alone will dictate the discharge exception in question. Under these facts, however, citation to the specific sub-subsection in \u00a7 523(a) is necessary because of the ambiguous nature of Barbara's allegations. Yet notice of the discharge exception, whether made known by citation or by clear implication from the allegations, is important. For example, to the extent that Barbara invokes an exception under \u00a7 523(a) that includes fraud as a basis for nondischargeability, the Court agrees with April that the Adversary Complaint would be subject to the heightened pleading requirements of Rule 9.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Haber Oil Co. v.

Under these circumstances, where the Court has lifted the stay\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   to allow the Circuit Court to resolve the state-law claims and where amendments to the Adversary Complaint will be necessary anyway to reflect the judgment of the Circuit Court, the Court denies the Motion to Dismiss without prejudice as to Barbara's \u00a7 523 claims and grants Barbara's motion\n   <em>\n    ore tenus\n   </em>\n   to allow her to cure the deficiencies in her allegations. The amended Adversary Complaint, in addition to outlining the relevant events that occurred in the Circuit Court Action, should cite the specific sub-subsection under \u00a7 523(a) which forms the basis of her dischargeability claim and also should state with particularity any allegations of fraud. To avoid any undue delay, the Court orders Barbara to file the amended Adversary Complaint within twenty-one (21) days after final resolution by the Circuit Court of the state-law claims and orders April to file an answer or other responsive pleading within fourteen (14) days after service of the amended Adversary Complaint.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   FED.

As noted previously, her allegations imply claims under \u00a7 727(a)(4)(A)-(B). April argues that Barbara has failed to plead the allegations under \u00a7 727(a)(4)(A)-(B) with particularity in order to meet the Rule 9 standard and survive the Motion to Dismiss. Because \u00a7 727(a)(4) requires a showing that April \"knowingly and fraudulently\" made the false oath or presented a false claim, the heightened pleading standard of Rule 9 applies. The Court examines Barbara's \u00a7 727 claims under sub-subsections (a)(4)(A) and (a)(4)(B) separately.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   The elements of an objection to discharge under \u00a7 727(a)(4)(A) are that: (1) the debtor made a false statement under oath; (2) the statement was false; (3) the debtor knew the statement was false; (4) the debtor made the statement with fraudulent intent; and (5) the statement was material to the bankruptcy case.\n   <em>\n    Beaubouef v.

In the Adversary Complaint, Barbara identifies the alleged false statement made under oath-the size of April's household-but fails to explain why the statement in Schedule J is false or what made the statement fraudulent. (Adv. Dkt. 1 at 2). For example, it is possible that a debtor could report no dependents on his or her income tax returns and yet still provide financial\n   support for other individuals in the same household.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Thomas\n   </em>\n   , No. 17-03558-NPO, at *9-13 (Bankr. S.D. Miss. Mar. 22, 2018) (adopting economic unit approach in determining a debtor's household size). Barbara then alleges, in a conclusory fashion, that April's \"annual income exceeds the threshold, triggering a means calculation test, which she has attempted to avoid.\" (Adv. Dkt. 1 at 2). She fails to demonstrate, however, how April's avoidance of the means test is material to the Bankruptcy Case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   There is sparse case law applying Barbara's alternative claim under \u00a7 727(a)(4)(B).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hendon v.

E.D. Tenn. 2000). The elements of an objection to discharge under \u00a7 727(a)(4)(B) are that: (1) the debtor knowingly and fraudulently; (2) presented or used a false claim; (3) in connection with the debtor's own case. 6 COLLIER ON BANKRUPTCY \u00b6 727.05. In other words, the evidence must show that the debtor \"presented or used\" inflated or fictitious claims in his or her bankruptcy case with the intent to defraud.\n   <em>\n    Scheidelman v. Henderson (In re Henderson)\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3789640\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/423/598/#p619\">\n    423 B.R. 598\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 619 (Bankr. N.D.N.Y. 2010) (noting that objections to discharge under \u00a7 727(a)(4)(B) generally involve the scheduling of non-existent debts, the scheduling of inflated debts, or the filing by the debtor of a false proof of claim). Barbara alleges in the Adversary Complaint that April presented a false claim by scheduling $77,000.00 as a debt or loan from Roger. However, she does not allege facts that demonstrate fraudulent intent or materiality to the Bankruptcy Case. What purpose did scheduling the allegedly false debt to Roger serve in the Bankruptcy Case?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   For the same reasons discussed with respect to Barbara's \u00a7 523(a) claims and in the interest of judicial economy, the Court also denies the Motion to Dismiss without prejudice as to the \u00a7 727 claims and grants Barbara's motion\n   <em>\n    ore tenus\n   </em>\n   to amend the Adversary Complaint. The amended Adversary Complaint should specify the allegations which form the basis of her dischargeability claim under \u00a7 727(a)(4)(A)-(B) and also state with particularity her allegations of fraud. For efficiency, the same deadline applicable to the amendment of the Adversary Complaint with respect to the \u00a7 523(a) claims shall apply to the \u00a7 727(a)(4) claims. In other words, Barbara shall amend the Adversary Complaint only once as to all of her claims within twenty-one (21) days after final resolution by the Circuit Court of the state-law claims, and April shall file an answer or other responsive pleading within fourteen (14) days after service of the amended Adversary Complaint.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   FED. R. CIV. P. 15(a)(3) (as adopted by FED. R. BANKR. P. 7015 ). Accordingly, the Court will hold in abeyance not only the \u00a7 523(a) claims but also the \u00a7 727 claims and, thus, the entire Adversary.
