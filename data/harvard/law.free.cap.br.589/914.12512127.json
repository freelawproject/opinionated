The Security Instrument granting USAA an interest in the Brashears' property was executed on August 26, 2016. Doc. 4-1 at 36.

Doc. 15 at 7:2-7. According to USAA, the intent of the transfer was for the Brashears to convey the \"full bucket of rights\" in the property to USAA and to \"convey a first priority lien against the property.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20547\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20547\">\n    at 6:6-10, 8:5-8\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But under Georgia law, USAA argues, CB &amp; T held legal title to the property through its security deed, and the Brashears retained a \"a mere equity of redemption and right of possession of the realty until the secured debt [was] satisfied in full.\"\n   <em>\n    Patel v.

Therefore, USAA argues the Brashears could not fulfill the intent of the parties, by transferring the \"full bucket of rights,\" until their debt to CB &amp; T was paid and CB &amp; T cancelled its security deed. Doc. 15 at 6:6-10 (\"Our position would be that-the intention of the parties ... could not occur under Georgia law until both the CB &amp; T debt had been paid in full and the CB &amp; T security deed was canceled of record.\")\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   O.C.G.A. \u00a7 44-14-67(a) (\"In all cases where property is conveyed to secure a debt, the surrender and cancellation of the deed, in the same manner as mortgages are canceled, on payment of the debt to any person legally authorized to receive the same, shall operate to reconvey the title of the property to the grantor or the grantor's heirs, executors, administrators, or assigns.\"). CB &amp; T did not cancel its security deed until October 6, 2017. So, USAA argues the transfer did not become effective until that date-when the parties' intent could finally be carried out. And because USAA filed its security deed 11 days later on October 17, 2016, USAA argues under \u00a7 547(e)(2) the transfer is deemed to have occurred on October 6, 2017, which is beyond the 90-day preference period and makes the transfer not an avoidable preference.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   This argument, based as it is on the intention of the parties, is essentially a contract-interpretation argument.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   The\n   Court must inquire whether the agreement between the parties, the Security Instrument, which documented the transfer of the security deed to USAA, reflected this intention-that it would not be effective until CB &amp; T cancelled its security interest.

Nothing in the contract states that the transfer of rights was contingent on any actions between USAA and a third party, which is what would be required to support USAA's argument-the contract would have to be contingent on a third party's interest being extinguished. While the Security Instrument recognized that existing third-party interests in the property with priority over USAA's interest would be extinguished, such as CB &amp; T's security deed, the Security Instrument was in no way contingent upon that happening. Indeed, the point of any refinancing agreement, including this one, is to allow the new lender to take its own security interest and, having gained that security, the new lender can then pay the existing debt. Far from advancing the parties' intent, the argument that debtors have not immediately conveyed any interest to secure debt completely undercuts a new lender's intent in a refinancing agreement-if the new lender is not gaining any interest in the property, it would not advance money to pay the existing debt. In short, the idea that these parties or any parties to a financing agreement do not intend to convey any interest in the secured property until the existing security interest has been cancelled has no basis in law or fact.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Moreover, as USAA admitted at oral argument, the Brashears did have some interest in the property when the Security\n   Instrument was executed, and, based on the clear wording of the Security Instrument, it was effective when signed and thus transferred whatever interest the Brashears had to USAA on August 26, 2018. And because USAA did not perfect its security interest until October 17, 2016, the Bankruptcy Court was correct in finding that USAA perfected that interest more than 30 days after the transfer became effective, meaning the transfer occurred on the date of perfection under \u00a7 547(e)(2)(B).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Accordingly, the Court affirms the Bankruptcy Court's determination that there is no genuine dispute that the transfer occurred on October 17, 2016, within the 90-day preference period, and thus that there was no genuine dispute that the Trustee met its burden under \u00a7 547(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Substantially Contemporaneous Exchange\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   In response to the Trustee's summary judgment motion, USAA argued that the transfer between it and the Brashears was intended to be a substantially contemporaneous exchange and thus not avoidable under \u00a7 547(b). The Bankruptcy Court, however, found that there was no genuine dispute that the transfer was not in fact a substantially contemporaneous exchange.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Generally, if a trustee has established that a transfer meets the requirements of \u00a7 547(b), that transfer may be avoided.

But Loll, whose name and title were stamped into blanks on his affidavit, did not claim to have personal knowledge of the refinancing of the Brashears' property.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n    at 96-98. Given that Loll claims only to be a records custodian, he does not appear to have sufficient knowledge to support his testimony that the \"delay in perfecting the security interest was not intended by USAA and was not improperly motivated.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 98. Indeed, at oral argument, USAA agreed with the Court's statement that the \"fill-in-the-blank affiant ... culled some information from the documents, but other than that, the affidavit doesn't tell us anything about the cause of the delay.\" Doc. 15 at 12:10-19.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-72\">\n    But even so, viewed in the light most favorable to USAA, the Court agrees with the Bankruptcy Court that Loll's affidavit is evidence that the delay was not improperly motivated or intentional. The Bankruptcy Court, based on this evidence, found that USAA had established the delay was not improperly motivated or intentional. Relying on\n    <em>\n     Hedrick\n    </em>\n    , USAA argues that the Bankruptcy Court gave too little weight to this determination because, according to USAA, whether the delay was intentional is the \"most important fact\" in the analysis. Doc. 4 at 17. However, as the Bankruptcy Court pointed out, USAA's interpretation of\n    <em>\n     Hedrick\n    </em>\n    is too narrow. Doc. 4-1 at 161-62.\n    <em>\n     Hedrick\n    </em>\n    actually states \"the most important fact\n    <em>\n     may\n    </em>\n    be whether the delay in perfecting the interest was intended by the creditor\n    <em>\n     or resulted from its negligence.\n    </em>\n    \"\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3824038,3565031\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/524/1175/\">\n     524 F.3d at 1190-91\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (emphasis added). Contrary to USAA's interpretation,\n    <em>\n     Hedrick\n    </em>\n    states only that these facts\n    <em>\n     may\n    </em>\n    be the \"most important\" depending on the circumstances but does not demand it be given greater weight than other factors.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3824038,3565031\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/524/1175/\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    Moreover,\n    <em>\n     Hedrick\n    </em>\n    gives equal weight to whether the delay resulted from the creditor's negligence.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3824038,3565031\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/524/1175/\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"14\">\n   <p id=\"p-73\">\n    USAA has alluded, without supporting evidence, that the delay in perfection was based on CB &amp; T's delay in cancelling its security deed.
