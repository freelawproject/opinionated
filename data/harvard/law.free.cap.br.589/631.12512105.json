The 100% owner of AMC is Aurora Real Estate and Property Investments, LLC (\"ARE\") which is itself a debtor in a chapter 11 case,\n   <em>\n    In re\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Aurora Real Estate &amp; Property Invs., LLC\n   </em>\n   , No.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20Barb.%2016030\">\n    18 B 16030\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Taher Kameli, a Chicago immigration lawyer, owns 100% of ARE.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   AMC is one of several health care facilities in Illinois and Florida with which Kameli is involved. These facilities, or more specifically the investment funds Kameli established in connection with them, have served as investment vehicles for foreign nationals interested in gaining U.S. citizenship though the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Service's EB-5 Program. Created under the Immigration Act of 1990, the EB-5 Program extends citizenship to immigrants who invest in designated U.S. businesses that create a certain number of jobs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Kameli's investment scheme has not sat well with the federal government. In April 2017, the SEC brought a civil enforcement action (the \"SEC action\") against Kameli and others alleging that the handling of the investment funds violated the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. AMC was named in the action as a \"relief defendant,\" meaning that it was not accused of any wrongdoing but was joined to have it disgorge monies received as a result of the wrongdoing of other defendants.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Holzhueter v. Groth (In re Holzhueter)\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12269060\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/575/444/#p449\">\n    575 B.R. 444\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 449 (Bankr. W.D. Wis. 2017). In September 2017, the district court denied the SEC's motion for a preliminary injunction to bar Kameli from further violations of the securities laws and further involvement with EB-5 investments.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    S.E.C. v. Kameli\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12419065\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/276/852/\">\n    276 F.Supp.3d 852\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (N.D. Ill. 2017). The defendants have since moved to dismiss the SEC's complaint. Those motions are pending.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Foreign investment was not the only one source of AMC's funding. In 2015, the Bank loaned AMC $6.5 million. The loan was secured by a mortgage on AMC's property as well as pledges of ARE's ownership interest in AMC and Kameli's ownership interest in ARE. Kameli also personally guaranteed the loan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The loan matured on December 1, 2016. When AMC failed to repay it on the maturity date, the Bank filed an action in Illinois state court to foreclose on the mortgage and recover on the note. The complaint also included a claim for replevin seeking to recover Kameli's interest in ARE and ARE's interest in AMC. Within days of the action's filing, the state court appointed a receiver who assumed responsibility for the property. At some point, the Bank moved for partial summary judgment on its complaint, and the state court set the motion for ruling on April 27, 2017.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On April 18, before the state court could rule on the motion, a creditor of AMC, Meridian Senior Living, LLC, filed an involuntary chapter 11 petition against AMC. The Bank moved under section 543(d)(1) of the Code,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20543\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 543\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(1), to have the receiver excused from his obligation to turn over the property, and the motion was granted. The receiver has remained in possession of the property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   For reasons that have never been clear, petitioning creditor Meridian waited until May 9 to have a summons issued to AMC. Rather than contest the petition, though, on June 4 AMC consented to the entry of an order for relief, and an order for relief was entered the next day. Since then, the case has proceeded as a voluntary case under chapter 11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   AMC's list of creditors and other entities was due on June 12, and its schedules, statement of financial affairs, and other documents were due on June 19.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20521\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 521\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1) ; Fed. R. Bankr. P. 1007(a)(2), (c). AMC failed to file any of these materials on time, prompting the U.S. Trustee to move to convert or dismiss the case. The SEC joined in the motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   AMC eventually filed partial schedules on July 23, several days late. AMC filed its list of creditors the next day, more than a month late. The remaining schedules and amended versions of the earlier schedules were not filed until August 7, two months after the order for relief was entered. The statement of financial affairs was not filed until August 22. A set of amended schedules was filed the same day. (After the amended schedules were filed, the U.S. Trustee withdrew its motion.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The schedules AMC filed raise questions about the value of its facility, questions that have never been answered adequately. The Schedule D filed on July 23 listed the facility's value as $10 million. The amended Schedules A/B and D filed on August 22, on the other hand, listed the value as $16 million. According to the amended schedules, the new value was based on an \"appraisal.\" AMC has mentioned the appraisal several times in the course of the case, but it has never been produced.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   AMC's schedules (as amended on August 22) disclosed $8.561 million in secured debt, $8.4 million of it owed to the Bank. The schedules also disclosed $13.206 million in unsecured debt. Of that amount, the vast majority, more than $12 million, is owed to entities connected with Kameli: Chicagoland Foreign Investment Group, Bright Oaks Development, Aurora Assisted Living EB-5 Fund LLC, and others. Another $214,478 is owed to Kameli personally and to his law firms (he appears to have two).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   To date, AMC has filed no monthly operating reports in the case, as sections 1106(a)(1) and 704(a)(8) require.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201106\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1106\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1), 704(a)(8).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   AMC also has yet to propose a plan. AMC's intention (reflected in, among other places, Kameli's deposition testimony in the adversary proceeding) is to obtain post-petition financing in an amount sufficient both to pay the Bank and allow for continued operations.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   AMC has maintained since the petition date that it has secured $10 million in financing (or more recently \"up to $10 million\" (Resp. at 3) ) from T2 Capital Management, and AMC produced a letter of intent from T2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The T2 letter of intent has several contingencies, one of which is the dismissal of AMC with prejudice as a party to the SEC action. Kameli testified at his deposition that he had discussed the dismissal idea with the SEC's attorneys and reached an agreement on the subject back in April. Under the agreement, AMC and its related fund would be dismissed as parties with prejudice, but if AMC's financing fell through, the SEC would be able to rejoin them. (Dep. 39-40). According to Kameli, the agreement required approval from the SEC in Washington, but he believed he would have that approval \"in the next few months.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 41). That was on July 6, more than three months after the supposed agreement with the SEC's attorneys.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Two months later, on September 17, AMC moved to lift the automatic stay to allow it to \"take action, including the filing of motions, in the SEC litigation, to bring the case to a conclusion and to resolve the claim of the SEC against it.\" The motion said that AMC had \"been in discussions with the SEC for months in an attempt to resolve the SEC claims against it, but to\n   date no final decision [had] been made by the SEC regarding a resolution.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Kameli conceded at his deposition that even the T2 financing would not be enough for AMC to make a go of it. In addition, he testified, AMC would need to \"increase[ ] the number of occupants to support the debt.\" (Dep. at 51). As of May 14, 2018, AMC had 44 residents, up from 22 when the receiver was appointed. Kameli estimated that the facility would need to increase occupancy to \"54, 55 residents\" to generate enough cash for debt service. Servicing the T2 debt, Kameli estimated, would take \"70 to $80,000\" each month. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 50).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   According to the receiver, however, full occupancy of 60 residents would give AMC annual total revenue of $3,659,307 and annual net operating income of $554,000. (Mot. Ex. 8, Aff. of M. Flanagan, Ex. B). And that figure does not take into account real estate taxes on the property. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 9). Each installment of the 2017 real estate taxes (the first due in June 2018, the second due in September 2018) is $117,027, or a total of $234,054. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 10). Subtracting that sum from annual net operating income would leave only $319,946, or $26,662 each month, for debt service.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The Bank now moves under section 1112(b) to convert or dismiss AMC's case. As \"cause\" for conversion or dismissal, the Bank asserts that AMC has no reasonable likelihood of confirming a plan. The Bank adds that AMC has filed no monthly operating reports in the case. The Bank asks for dismissal rather than conversion to chapter 7. AMC opposes the motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The Bank's motion will be granted. The Bank has shown cause to convert or dismiss the case, and AMC has not shown unusual circumstances warranting the case's continuation, let alone any of the other statutory exceptions. Dismissal or conversion is therefore mandatory. Given the uncertainty about the facility's value, however, the case will not be dismissed but will be converted to chapter 7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    a. Statutory Framework\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Section 1112(b) of the Code provides for the conversion or dismissal of a chapter 11 case on motion of a party in interest. Before Congress amended the Code in 2005, conversion or dismissal under section 1112(b) was a matter left mostly to the court's discretion. Since 2005, however, that discretion has been curtailed; conversion or dismissal is now mandatory if the movant meets its burden of proof.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Domiano\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3787772\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/442/97/#p104\">\n    442 B.R. 97\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 104-05 (Bankr.

The reorganization AMC proposes - indeed, the only one it has ever mentioned - entails refinancing its $8.4 million debt to the Bank. But AMC has no financing currently available and has shown no prospect of obtaining any. AMC claims in its response to the Bank's motion that it has \"secured financing through T2 Investments.\" (Resp. at 2). As evidence, AMC attaches T2's March 28 letter of intent. The letter, though, declared that it was \"presented for discussion purposes only and does not constitute an offer, agreement, or commitment to lend.\" At most, then, T2 expressed an interest in discussing a loan. T2 made no financing commitment. AMC has produced no financing commitment from T2 or anyone else.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   What is more, T2's loan proposal has long since expired. In its letter, T2 spelled out in some detail the terms of the loan it was prepared to make. Those terms included a closing date \"no later than April 13, 2018.\" That date passed more than five months ago. AMC nonetheless maintains the T2 financing is still available, and as evidence of T2's supposed continued interest AMC submits another letter, this one\n   from an entity called Hyve Capital which apparently serves as AMC's broker.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Hyve letter declares: \"We have been reassured that T2 Investments has completed the majority of due diligence and will be prepared to close on the $10MM credit facility ....\" But Hyve does not explain the basis for that conclusion, and its letter is dated May 31, 2018, more than four months ago. AMC offers no evidence that financing from T2 remains a possibility today.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Even if T2 were still interested in lending on the terms in its April letter, the letter laid out several conditions to financing that AMC cannot meet. One was that \"[AMC] shall have been dismissed with prejudice and all claims against the property shall have been forever waived and released from [the SEC action].\" To date, though, AMC remains a defendant in the SEC action. Kameli insisted at his deposition that in April AMC had reached an agreement with the SEC's attorneys to have AMC dismissed as a party with prejudice; AMC was waiting only on Washington's approval of the agreement. But AMC offers nothing to corroborate Kameli's testimony - no correspondence between AMC and the SEC, nothing in writing representing so much as a draft of the agreement. The SEC (which has appeared in this case) has not confirmed such an agreement or, for that matter, that one has been discussed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Even if there is such an agreement, Washington has not approved it, as AMC admits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   In addition to dismissal from the SEC action, T2 required as conditions to closing that AMC pay \"up-front points\" of $200,000 at closing and a six-month \"interest reserve\" at closing. The interest reserve aside, AMC has no ability to pay the \"up-front points,\" since its amended Schedule A/B shows it has only $35,598 in cash on hand, nowhere close to the $200,000 it would need.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   And assuming the loan did close, AMC has not explained how it could pay off the $10 million principal by the two-year maturity date - or pay the minimum $1 million in interest T2 required or the \"deferred points\" of 1.5% of the loan balance outstanding (or $150,000). In fact, the record shows that AMC would be unable to service the debt even with its facility at full occupancy. At his deposition, Kameli estimated that the monthly debt service would be somewhere in the region of $70-80,000. According to the receiver, however, at full occupancy AMC would generate annual operating income (net of all expenses, including substantial real estate taxes) of $319,946, or just $26,662 per month. At peak operation, in other words, AMC's net monthly income would leave it more than $40,000 short of the amount needed to service the T2 debt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   To these financial obstacles AMC has no answer. AMC cites gross revenue figures from past reports the receiver made to the state court. (Resp. at 3). But those figures concern gross revenue, not net revenue. What matters is the money AMC would have left over for debt service. AMC also\n   notes that the facility is operating at 66% capacity and says that increasing capacity to 100% would \"increase revenue.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Undoubtedly. But AMC does not show that the increased revenue would be enough to service the proposed T2 debt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   AMC then asserts that a \"recent appraisal\" shows the facility to be worth $16 million, far more than the Bank's debt. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). The relevance of the mysterious appraisal (which has been mentioned but never produced) is unclear. Even if the Bank is indeed protected by a \"substantial equity cushion,\" as AMC asserts, the Bank wants the case dismissed, not the stay lifted (when questions of equity can be relevant,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20362\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 362\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(2)(A) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Confirmation cannot be based on \"speculation\" or \"visionary projections\" of a plan's success.\n   <em>\n    Repurchase Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1287370\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/332/336/#p342\">\n    332 B.R. at 343\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

AMC's initial schedules gave a value for the facility of $10 million, and that figure increased in the amended schedules to $16 million. Against the Bank's $8.4 million debt (along with a real estate tax debt scheduled as $120,000), the values from the schedules show equity of either $1,480,000 or $7,480,000 - easily sufficient to warrant administration in chapter 7. As evidence of value, this is admittedly pretty thin stuff. But at least it is something - and the Bank offers nothing to call it into question, just the unsupported conclusion that the Bank is \"most likely\" the only creditor who will be paid. (Mot. at 12; Reply at 14). In the absence of better evidence, the schedules are enough to support conversion to chapter 7.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Napolitano v.

The AMC facility is the only significant asset in the estate, and that asset is currently in the hands of a receiver. Conversion to chapter 7 would simply substitute a new custodian (a trustee) for the current one. The Bank is also the sole creditor that has participated significantly in the case, and of the three creditors that have participated at all (the other two are the SEC and Meridian) only the Bank has expressed a preference.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   That preference is dismissal. Because creditors are \"the best judges of what is in their own best interests,\" when creditors agree the court should ordinarily accommodate their wishes.\n   <em>\n    Rey\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2006%20WL%202457435\">\n    2006 WL 2457435\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Still, with some indication that the AMC facility could have significant equity to pay unsecured creditors, the prudent course is to convert the case rather than dismiss it. A chapter 7 trustee has greater powers than a receiver and has duties to creditors receivers do not have. Conversion will allow a trustee to investigate whether a sale of the facility would indeed produce a significant dividend for AMC's unsecured creditors. From the Bank's point of view, the resulting delay from a conversion should be minimal. If the trustee concludes a sale is not worthwhile, a \"no distribution\" report will be filed, the case will close, the property will be deemed abandoned, and the Bank will be free to pursue its remedies in the state court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   <strong>\n    3.

A copy is attached to AMC's motion for preliminary injunction in the adversary proceeding.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"8\">\n   <p id=\"p-92\">\n    The SEC's actions in this bankruptcy case and the tone it has taken tend to suggest otherwise. When the U.S. Trustee moved to dismiss or convert the case, the SEC did not sit on the sidelines but instead joined the motion. More recently, the SEC opposed AMC's motion to lift the stay to bring the SEC action against it \"to a conclusion.\" The SEC said that it had \"no idea\" how AMC could accomplish that end and characterized the motion as \"a waste of judicial resources and the parties' time and expense.\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"9\">\n   <p id=\"p-93\">\n    Because the Bank has demonstrated that AMC is in fact not reasonably likely to confirm a plan, no showing to the contrary - that a plan is likely to be confirmed - is even possible.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Attack Props.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6052745\" index=\"112\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/478/337/\">\n     478 B.R. at 345\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (making this point under identical circumstances).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"10\">\n   <p id=\"p-94\">\n    In fact, the Bank is the only party in interest that has expressed a preference.
