Craig Whitley, United States Bankruptcy Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   This matter is before the Court on the motion of Daniel and Sara Roselli (the \"Defendants\" or the \"Rosellis\"), to dismiss Claims Two and Three of the Amended Complaint filed by The Finley Group (the \"Plaintiff\" or the \"Liquidating Agent\"), Liquidating Agent for RedF Marketing, LLC (\"RedF\"), pursuant Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Having considered the parties' briefs and oral arguments, this court concludes that the Second (Turnover) and Third (Conversion) Claims must be dismissed with prejudice. Regarding the Second Claim, the Liquidating Agent has failed to plead an undisputed property interest in the subject monies to support turnover under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20542\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 542\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Equitable subrogation is unavailing not only because any such claim is unliquidated, but also because (1) the claim is time barred, (2) the Amended Complaint does not plead all of the necessary elements and (3) the Liquidating Agent seeks to subrogate not to the original creditors rights, but to those of the original account debtor. The Third Claim (conversion) must be dismissed due to the failure to plead facts and law demonstrating the bankruptcy estate's (the \"Estate\") ownership of the subject property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Given the lengthy prior proceedings in this case, a summation of what has already occurred is helpful to frame the current dispute between the Liquidating Agent and the Rosellis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Prior to bankruptcy, RedF was a North Carolina limited liability corporation operated by member/managers Dan and Sara Roselli. After losing a trademark infringement action in U.S. District Court, RedF was forced into an involuntary bankruptcy case by its creditor on October 12, 2012. See\n   <em>\n    Bridgetree, Inc. et al. v. Redf Marketing, LLC, et al.\n   </em>\n   , Case No. 10-CV-00228. RedF chose to convert to Chapter 11 and, after lengthy negotiations, confirmed a consensual plan of liquidation on April 29, 2013 (the \"Plan\"). Plan of Liquidation of RedF Marketing, LLC,\n   <em>\n    In re RedF Marketing, LLC\n   </em>\n   , No. 12-32462 (2012), ECF No. 69; Modification of Plan,\n   <em>\n    In re RedF Marketing, LLC\n   </em>\n   , No. 12-32462 (2013), ECF No. 150; Second Modification of Plan,\n   <em>\n    In re RedF Marketing, LLC\n   </em>\n   , No. 12-32462 (2013), ECF No. 155.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Under the Plan, many of the company's assets were sold to a third party. A Liquidating Agent\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   was appointed to administer\n   the remainder, primarily lawsuits, for the benefit of creditors. The Rosellis' ownership interests in RedF were cancelled and RedF ceased to exist as an entity. Mutual releases of claims were exchanged between the Rosellis and the Liquidating Agent. With this, the Rosellis' involvement in the bankruptcy case appeared to be over.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   However, as the Liquidating Agent proceeded to file transfer avoidance actions against third parties (to whom the Rosellis might be liable should the actions succeed), the Rosellis again became active in the case. The Rosellis were named in third party complaints by some of the transfer defendants. See Third Party Complaint,\n   <em>\n    State of North Carolina v. Packard Place Properties, LLC.\n   </em>\n   , AP No. 14-03267 (2015), ECF No. 24. They organized defense efforts in those adversary proceedings and reasserted monetary claims against the bankruptcy estate-much to the annoyance of the Liquidating Agent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Among the avoidance actions in question was a suit against the United States of America. In that proceeding, the Liquidating Agent seeks to recover $639,675.00 of prepetition payments made by RedF to the Internal Revenue Service (the \"IRS\") on account of the Rosellis' 2010-11 personal tax liabilities. Complaint,\n   <em>\n    The Finley Group v. United\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    States of America\n   </em>\n   , AP No. 14-3266 (2014), ECF No. 1. That action is pending.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   A second transfer avoidance action was brought against the State of North Carolina (the \"State\"). Complaint,\n   <em>\n    The Finley Group v. State of North Carolina\n   </em>\n   , AP. No. 14-3267 (2014) ECF No. 1. That action, since settled, sought to recover another $64,470.00 of prepetition payments made by RedF to the North Carolina Department of Revenue in payment of the Rosellis' individual tax liabilities for tax years 2010-11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    The Present Action\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On April 14, 2014, almost a year after the Plan's Effective Date and while both actions were pending against the two taxing authorities, the Rosellis filed amended state and federal tax returns for tax years 2010 and 2011 on RedF's behalf, and presumably, for themselves.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Complaint,\n   <em>\n    The Finley Group v. Roselli\n   </em>\n   , AP No. 17-03063 (2017) ECF No. 1. As a result, the Rosellis received tax refunds totaling approximately $650,000.00 (the \"Tax Refunds\"). The Rosellis did not notify the Liquidating Agent before amending the returns, nor did they inform the Liquidating Agent when they received the Tax Refunds. Amended Complaint,\n   <em>\n    The Finley Group v. Roselli\n   </em>\n   , AP No. 17-03063 (2017) ECF No. 38.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Upon learning of these events, the Liquidating Agent filed the present action against the Rosellis (the \"Original Complaint\"). Complaint,\n   <em>\n    The Finley Group v. Roselli\n   </em>\n   , AP No. 17-03063 (2017) ECF No. 1. The Original Complaint sought relief against the Rosellis for a variety of alleged transgressions; however, the most significant of those claims pertained to the Tax Refunds. First, the Original Complaint asserted that the Rosellis' amendment of RedF's tax returns constituted a willful violation of the Plan.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20542\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Second, the Liquidating Agent demanded turnover of the Tax Refunds under Bankruptcy Code Section 542.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20542\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Third, the Liquidating Agent asserted state law claims against the Rosellis for conversion and constructive trust as to the Tax Refunds.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20542\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    The First Dismissal Motion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The Rosellis moved to dismiss the Original Complaint (the \"First Dismissal Motion\"). Motion to Dismiss,\n   <em>\n    The Finley Group v. Roselli\n   </em>\n   , AP No. 17-03063 (2017) ECF No. 21. After briefing and a hearing, the First Dismissal Motion was granted in part and denied in part (the \"First Order\"). Order,\n   <em>\n    The Finley Group v. Roselli\n   </em>\n   , AP No. 17-03063 (2017) ECF No. 36. Specifically, those portions of the First Claim (Willful violations of the Plan) founded upon the acts described in subparagraphs (a) through (d) of paragraph 57 were dismissed with prejudice, for failure to state claims upon which relief could be granted. The remainder of the First Claim survived.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The remaining counts of the Original Complaint pertained to the Tax Refunds and were founded on the proposition that these monies originally belonged to the Estate. The Second Claim (Turnover) asserted that the Tax Refunds were subject to turnover under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20542\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 542\n   </extracted-citation>\n   because the Estate was \"equitably subrogated\" to the Rosellis' rights in the Tax Refunds or alternatively, the Tax Refunds were \"proceeds of property of the Debtor's estate...\" Complaint,\n   <em>\n    The Finley Group v.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Roselli\n   </em>\n   , AP No. 17-03063 (2017) ECF No. 1. The Third Claim accused the Rosellis of converting the Tax Refunds. Finally, the Fourth Claim sought to impose a constructive trust over the Tax Refunds and any proceeds thereof.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The Rosellis disagreed with the premise of Estate ownership of the Tax Refunds, for two essential reasons. First, the Rosellis argued that the Plan did not preserve any rights in the Estate as to the Tax Refunds. Second, and because RedF was for tax purposes a \"pass through\" entity,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   the Rosellis argued that the company's tax attributes, including any rights to the Tax Refunds, belonged to themselves as RedF's owners.

This Court disagreed with the Rosellis' first argument but agreed with the second. As pled, the Second, Third and Fourth Claims of the Original Complaint failed to plead plausible claims for relief. Order, The Finley Group v. Roselli, AP No. 17-03063 (2017) ECF No. 36. However, the Liquidating Agent was afforded an opportunity to amend its complaint.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20542\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    The Amended Complaint\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The Liquidating Agent filed its Amended Complaint on October 26, 2017 (the \"Amended Complaint\"). Amended Complaint,\n   <em>\n    The Finley Group v. Roselli\n   </em>\n   , AP No. 17-03063 (2017) ECF No. 38. The Amended Complaint is substantially similar to the Original Complaint but contains a few new averments to support the Estate's ownership contentions as to the Tax Refunds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   In particular, the amended Second Claim for Relief (Turnover) attempts to flesh out the claim for equitable subordination.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20542\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   A new allegation posits that, while not legally liable for the Rosellis' personal income taxes, RedF paid the Rosellis' 2010-2011 tax obligations under the mistaken belief that it was required to do so. The Liquidating Agent contends that this mistaken belief was founded on RedF's Operating Agreement, which required RedF to make annual distributions to the Rosellis sufficient to pay their taxes on their shares of company income. The Liquidating Agent's contention is that, in paying the Rosellis' personal taxes, RedF was\n   acting under the good faith belief that it was protecting its own legal interests and not acting as a mere volunteer. With this, the Liquidating Agent concludes that RedF was equitably subrogated to the Rosellis' rights in any eventual refund of the tax payments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Similar amplification is added to the amended Third Claim (Conversion). In it, the Liquidating Agent posits that \"since the Rosellis' 2010 and 2011 taxes were paid with the Debtor's funds, it would be inequitable for the Rosellis to retain the Tax Refunds rather than the Debtor or the Debtor's estate. The Rosellis therefore received and held the Tax Refunds in a constructive trust for the Debtor's benefit.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20542\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20542\">\n    at 9\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The Plan Preserved all Legal Actions Belonging to the Bankruptcy Estate, Including Turnover Actions under Section 542. Assuming Such Actions Lie, the Liquidating Agent is Authorized to Bring Them.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The Rosellis have renewed their argument from the First Dismissal Motion,\n   that the Plan did not preserve or assign to the Liquidating Agent any right to the Tax Refunds. Defendants' Brief,\n   <em>\n    The Finley Group v. Roselli\n   </em>\n   , AP No. 17-03063 (2017) ECF No. 43 at 4. They point to Section 7.2 of the Plan. Under that provision, most of RedF's assets were sold to a newly formed corporation, Newco. The only assets preserved for administration by the Liquidating Agent were \"Liquidation Estate Assets.\" These consisted of: (i) Excluded Assets, (ii) Causes of Action owned by the Debtor, including, without limitation, all Avoidance Actions, and (iii) the Newco Agreement. Subparts (i) and (iii) are clearly inapplicable to his dispute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The Rosellis argue that if RedF had any rights in the Tax Refunds, those rights would constitute general intangibles under the Uniform Commercial Code and would be included in the \"Purchased Assets\" conveyed to Newco under Plan Section 7.1. Thus, Newco might own the Tax Refunds, but the Estate does not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The Trustee counters that the Tax Refunds are \"Causes of Action\" under the Plan and thus are assets preserved for administration by the Liquidating Agent. As defined in the Plan, \"Causes of Action\" includes \"all present or future claims, rights ... actions in law or equity or otherwise ... whether based on legal or equitable relief, whether arising under the Bankruptcy Code or federal, state, common, or other law or equity....\" Plan of Liquidation of RedF Marketing, LLC,\n   <em>\n    In re RedF Marketing, LLC\n   </em>\n   , No. 12-32462 (2012), ECF No. 69 at 5. \"Causes of Action\" also include Avoidance Actions, which in turn are defined as \"[a]ny and all actions which a trustee, debtor in possession, or other appropriate party in interest may assert on behalf of the Estate under the Bankruptcy Code,\n   <em>\n    including actions pursuant to sections 542\n   </em>\n   ... of the Bankruptcy Code.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3809896\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/429/73/#p90\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   On this particular point, this court agrees with the Liquidating Agent. The specific provisions of the Plan control its more general terms. Here, the Plan expressly preserved all legal actions belonging to the bankruptcy estate, including turnover actions under Section 542. Assuming that such actions lie, the Liquidating Agent is authorized to bring them. However, the assumption that any such actions lie is not well founded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    II. The Second Claim for Relief Fails to State a Claim for Turnover under Section 542 or Equitable Subrogation.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Bankruptcy Code Section 542(a) provides in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   an entity...in possession, custody, or control, during the case, of property that the trustee may use, sell, or lease under section 363 of this title,...shall deliver to the trustee, and account for, such property or the value of such property, unless such property is of inconsequential value or benefit to the estate. 11U.S.C. \u00a7 542.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   A properly pled claim for turnover pursuant to section 542 requires the trustee to allege four things:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   (1) the property is in the possession, custody or control of a noncustodial third party; (2) the property constitutes property of the estate; (3) the property is of the type that the trustee could use, sell or lease pursuant to section 363 or that the debtor could exempt under section 522; and (4) that the property is not of inconsequential value or benefit to the estate. 5\n   <em>\n    Collier on Bankruptcy\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 542.02, (Alan N.

There are a couple of problems with this theory.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   First, the argument is circular. Both iterations of the Complaint allege that the Tax Refunds are estate property under\n   Section 541 and are subject to turnover under Section 542. However, during the proceeding on the First Dismissal Motion, and when faced with the tax and case law discussed above that indicated the Rosellis as shareholders owned the Tax Refunds, the Liquidating Agent countered that it should nevertheless be equitably subrogated to the Rosellis' rights in those monies. Now, when faced with a state limitations period that bars an action for equitable subrogation, the Liquidating Agent doubles back to say that its claim is not just an equitable subrogation claim; it is a Section 542 action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   The Liquidating Agent's arguments are not just circular, they are flat out wrong. Because the Bankruptcy Code typically does not create property interests, the Tax Refunds are estate property only if state law or some other nonbankruptcy law has created a property interest in favor of the debtor. Here, the contention is that this property interest lies due to equitable subrogation. Unfortunately, such a cause is time barred-by the state limitations statute applicable to such causes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Second, the Liquidating Agent's argument entirely misapprehends Section 542. Turnover under Section 542 is available only for property that is undeniably estate property.\n   <em>\n    Stanziale v. Pepper Hamilton, LLP (In re Student Fin.

The prepetition transfers of RedF's property which paid the Rosellis' taxes have not been avoided.

Amended Complaint,\n   <em>\n    The Finley Group v. Roselli\n   </em>\n   , AP No. 17-03063 (2017) ECF No. 38 at 6-8 (\"the applicable tax codes did not legally obligate [RedF] to pay the Rosellis' personal federal and state income taxes....\" and the \"income or loss passed through to the Rosellis for [income] tax purposes.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   Seeking to demonstrate that RedF was protecting its own legal interests when it paid the Rosellis' taxes, the Amended Complaint cites Dan Roselli's mistaken belief that the Operating Agreement required this act.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8. This averment is legally insufficient. The obligation imposed by the Operating Agreement was owed by RedF to its members, not to the taxing authorities. However, equitable subrogation is unavailable to those who act without compulsion relating to the original creditor unless they do so in the good faith belief that they had such an interest or obligation.\n   <em>\n    Jamestown Mut. Ins. Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=176%20S.E.2d%20751\">\n    176 S.E.2d at 755-56\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added). RedF had no belief that it had any legal exposure to the taxing authorities on account of the Rosellis' taxes. As to the taxing authorities, RedF was but a volunteer. Thus, equitable subrogation does not lie.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   Furthermore, the explanation pled by the Liquidating Agent is objectively untenable. Since the Rosellis owned and operated RedF, and were the beneficiaries of the obligation imposed by the Operating Agreement as well, one must ask, what possible legal consequences could RedF\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   have faced had it had failed to pay the Rosellis' taxes? The answer indisputably is none. The Rosellis, as shareholders, could hardly sue RedF, the company they owned and operated, for failing to pay their personal tax debts. The Rosellis are on all sides of the Operating Agreement, making the tax obligation legally and practically unenforceable. Even accepted as true, the pled facts do not support a reasonable inference that the Rosellis had a \"good faith belief\" that by paying the Rosellis' taxes, RedF was protecting its own legal interests or obligations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Not surprisingly, the Liquidating Agent has cited no opinion holding that equitable subrogation is proper under facts similar to these.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   <em>\n    4. Even if Equitable Subrogation were Available to the Estate, it would not Support a Claim to the Tax Refunds.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   A final reason exists to deny the Second Claim for relief. The Amended Complaint asserts that the Estate is subrogated, not to the\n   <em>\n    taxing authorities' original tax claims against the Rosellis\n   </em>\n   , but instead to\n   <em>\n    the Rosellis' interest in the Tax Refunds\n   </em>\n   . Even if equitable subrogation lay, this would appear improper.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   As noted above, equitable subordination places the payor of a third party's debt in the position of the original creditor as against the original debtor. In this case, if the doctrine applied, and it does not, the Estate would be subrogated to the taxing authorities' rights against the Rosellis for their personal taxes, not directly to the Rosellis' interest in the Tax Refunds. The latter, of course, arose only after the Rosellis' amended the tax returns. And we now know that upon amendment, those taxing authorities concluded that at least as to the $650,000+ no debt was owed as they issued the Tax Refunds to the Rosellis. If subrogated to the taxing authorities' position, the Liquidating Agent would arguably be in the same position.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   The Second Claim is subject to dismissal for all four reasons.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   <strong>\n    III. The Third Claim for Relief (Conversion) is Subject to Dismissal for Failure to Adequately Plead an Ownership Interest in Property.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   The Third Claim also suffers from pleading deficiencies. A claim for conversion requires the plaintiff to allege and \"prove that it retained lawful ownership in the chattel and a right to immediate possession.\"\n   <em>\n    Variety Wholesalers Inc. v.

Here, the Liquidating Agent has failed to describe any legal property interest the Estate might possess in the Tax Refunds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   The Liquidating Agent instead makes the conclusory allegation that since the\n   Rosellis' 2010 and 2011 taxes were paid with the Debtor's funds, it would be inequitable for the Rosellis to retain them as opposed to the Estate. Amended Complaint,\n   <em>\n    The Finley Group v. Roselli\n   </em>\n   , AP No. 17-03063 (2017) ECF No. 38 at 9. Said otherwise, the Liquidating Agent has pled that RedF had an \"equitable interest in any refund of the Tax Payments in a constructive trust for the Debtor's benefit.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12641745\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/se2d/665/478/#p489\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   The first problem with the Liquidating Agent's claim is that it appears contrary to applicable tax law, which deems these tax attributes to belong to the shareholders, not their company.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   The Second problem is that the only identified equitable interest claimed by RedF in the Amended Complaint is one created by equitable subrogation, and for the reasons stated above, equitable subrogation is not a viable cause of action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   Finally, under North Carolina law, even a recognized equitable interest may not be sufficient to support a claim for conversion. The only case cited by the parties bearing on this question says it is not, at least as to titled vehicles. See,\n   <em>\n    Jenkins v. Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2485794\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc/324/394/\">\n    324 N.C. 394\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=378%20S.E.2d%20773\">\n    378 S.E.2d 773\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 776 (1989) (an automobile insurance company was not liable for injuries suffered by a passenger in the automobile because the purchaser failed to transfer title to his name and thus did not \" 'own' the vehicle within the terms of the liability insurance policy.\"). Admittedly, this is not a vehicle ownership claim, and one would not base a decision on this point alone. That said, conversion is a long-recognized state law cause of action, and the cases construing the cause are legion. Nevertheless, the Liquidating Agent cited no cases under North Carolina law, basing a right to conversion on an undefined, unliquidated equitable theory, where the asset in question is created and defined by comprehensive statutory schemes like the Federal and State Tax Codes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   For these reasons, the Third Claim fails to state a claim for conversion and must be dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   <strong>\n    Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   Under normal circumstances, the Liquidating Agent might have sued the Rosellis as beneficiaries, initial transferees, or even the subsequent transferees of the allegedly fraudulent tax payments that are presently being sought from the IRS.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   Alternatively, the Liquidating Agent might have sued the Rosellis for conversion of the monies in RedF's prepetition bank account, which the Rosellis used to pay their taxes. These payments may even have constituted illegal dividends under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.C.%20Gen.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%2055-6-40\">\n    N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 55-6-40\n   </extracted-citation>\n   given RedF's poor financial condition. However, because the Plan released all preconfirmation claims against the Rosellis, any such endeavor is foreclosed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   Instead, the Liquidating Agent chose to sue the taxing authorities. While it reached settlement with the State, its clawback action against the IRS has been met with stiff resistance. It remains to be seen whether that action will bear fruit. It also remains to be seen whether the actions of the Rosellis, described in Claim 1, give rise to a damages claim in favor of the Estate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   However, what is presently clear is that the Liquidating Agent holds no Section 542 Turnover claim against the Rosellis, has no recognized interest in the Tax Refunds, and has no viable state law claims based upon equitable subrogation or conversion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   Therefore, the Second and Third Claims must be dismissed with prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   The Scheduling Order entered in this adversary proceeding on September 13, 2017, as amended on October 12, 2017, is further amended to release the stay of proceedings in this action.
