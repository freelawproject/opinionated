This standard plainly does not entitle a reviewing court to reverse the finding of the trier of fact simply because it is convinced that it would have decided the case differently. The reviewing court oversteps the bounds of its duty under Fed. R. Civ. P. 52(a) if it undertakes to duplicate the role of the lower court. In applying the clearly erroneous standard ..., [reviewing] courts must constantly have in mind that their function is not to decided factual issues de novo. If the [lower] court's account of the evidence is plausible in light of the record viewed in its entirety, the [reviewing court] may not reverse it even though convinced that had it been sitting as the trier of fact, it would have weighed the evidence differently. Where there are two permissible views of the evidence, the factfinder's choice between them cannot be clearly erroneous.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   <em>\n    Anderson v.

In other words, [Debtor's] interest in the escrowed funds were subject to the same restrictions as ... before the sale....

For Appellant to show that the escrow deposit sufficiently changed Debtor's interest in the funds so that it was without value and did not become part of the bankruptcy estate, it is at least necessary that the escrow deposit altered the status quo. Here the Escrow Instructions preserved the status quo, and thus the escrow deposit does not affect when the relevant \u00a7 547 transfer occurred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Further, unlike escrow agreements sufficient for purposes of \u00a7 547 to divest a debtor of his interest property, the instant Escrow Instructions' terms neither 1) specify a definite granting condition; nor 2) provide that the grantor has pledged its interest in the escrowed property.
