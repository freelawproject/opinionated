Woodard, United States Bankruptcy Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   This adversary proceeding came before the Court for trial on August 16, 2018, on the\n   <em>\n    Complaint to Determine Nondischargeability of Debt and Allowed Claim\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    as to Lavinia Dumitrache and [her son]\n   </em>\n   (the \"Complaint\") (A.P. Dkt. # 1) filed by the creditor-plaintiffs Lavinia Dumitrache and her son (the \"Plaintiffs\") against the debtor-defendant David D. New (the \"Defendant\"). Both Ms. Dumitrache and the Defendant appeared and testified.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The Plaintiffs were previously awarded attorney's fees and costs in Tennessee state court proceedings in which they secured orders of protection in their favor against the Defendant, the former husband of Ms. Dumitrache and the father of her plaintiff son. The Plaintiffs filed the Complaint, seeking a determination, among other things, that this debt is a nondischargeable domestic support obligation under \u00a7 523(a)(5) of the Bankruptcy Code.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Defendant argues that the debt is not in the nature of support, but rather falls within the catch-all domestic provisions of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20523\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(15), and is therefore dischargeable in a chapter 13 case. Having considered the evidence, the argument of counsel, and the law, the Court concludes that the amounts owed to the Plaintiffs by the Defendant are domestic support obligations, and the debt is both nondischargeable in bankruptcy and a priority debt which must be paid in full over the life of the Defendant's chapter 13 plan as required by \u00a7\u00a7 1322(a)(2) and 507(a)(1)(A).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     JURISDICTION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   This Court has jurisdiction pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20151\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 151\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 157(a) and 1334, and the\n   <em>\n    United States District Court for the Northern District of Mississippi's Order of Reference of Bankruptcy Cases and Proceedings Nunc Pro Tunc\n   </em>\n   dated August 6, 1984.

Ms. Dumitrache credibly testified that at some point, she was contacted by her son's school regarding the suspected abuse of her son by the Defendant. The school and Ms. Dumitrache contacted the Tennessee Department of Children's Services (\"TDCS\"), but, because the abuse took place in Mississippi, TDCS indicated that it did not have jurisdiction over the allegations. The Mississippi Department of Child Protection Services was also contacted, but also raised jurisdictional issues, because Ms. Dumitrache's son is a resident of Tennessee. Both agencies urged Ms. Dumitrache to seek protective orders in Tennessee state court, as neither agency could do so because of the jurisdictional complications.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The State Court Cases\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Ms. Dumitrache sought a protection order for herself and her son against the Defendant in the General Sessions Criminal Court of Shelby County, Tennessee. The Honorable Yolanda Kight, Magistrate Judge, heard the case on March 30, 2016. Judge Kight stated on the record that she found the testimony of the Plaintiffs' witnesses to be credible and that the Plaintiffs had met their burden of proof. Judge Kight cited testimony in the record pertaining to the abuse, which included the Defendant spanking the child with a thorny\n   bush and barbed wire, forcing the child to pick up horse feces with his bare hands and put it in his mouth, and calling the child an \"S-O-B.\" Judge Kight also indicated that she believed that the child was fearful of his father, having nightmares that the Defendant was going to kill him and his mother. The Plaintiffs were granted Orders of Protection against the Defendant at the March 30, 2016 hearing (the \"Orders of Protection\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On April 6, 2016, Judge Kight entered an Order Supplementing Orders of Protection Awarding Petitioners Judgment for Attorney's Fees and Costs in the amount of $8,109.50 (for attorneys' fees in the amount of $7,500.00 and costs of $609.50)(the \"General Sessions Order\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The Defendant then filed suit in the Chancery Court of Shelby County, Tennessee, regarding the Orders of Protection.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   On March 20, 2017, Chancellor Joedae L. Jenkins entered an Order Awarding Defendants [Plaintiffs here] Judgment for Attorney Fees, Litigation Expenses, and Discretionary Costs (the \"Chancery Court Order\"). In the Chancery Court Order, the Defendant was ordered to pay the Plaintiffs an additional $25,398.21 in fees and expenses incurred in their defense of the Orders of Protection in that court ($24,000.00 in additional attorney's fees and $1,398.21 in additional costs). Together with the General Sessions Order, the Plaintiffs were awarded a total of $33,507.71 (\"the Fees\") for obtaining and defending the Orders of Protection. The Chancery Court Order provided that Fees were awarded pursuant to \u00a7 36-5-103(c) of the Tennessee Code, which allows for reasonable fees to be awarded in litigation to protect a child. Neither Tennessee court engaged in any analysis or balancing of the parties' respective financial need or ability to pay the Fees; such an analysis is not required under applicable Tennessee law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    B. The Bankruptcy Case\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The Defendant then filed his chapter 13 bankruptcy petition on May 24, 2017 (Bankr. Dkt. # 1). He scheduled the attorney's fees and costs awarded in the Chancery Court Order to the Plaintiffs as a general, unsecured debt, in the amount of $25,398.21 (Bankr. Dkt. # 8). The fees awarded in the General Sessions Order are not scheduled. On September 5, 2017, the Plaintiffs filed a Motion to Dismiss (the \"Motion to Dismiss\") (Bankr. Dkt. # 36), alleging that the bankruptcy case should be dismissed because the plan was proposed in bad faith under \u00a7 1322(a)(1)(2). The Plaintiffs also filed an Objection to Confirmation of the Chapter 13 Plan (the \"Objection to Confirmation\") (Bankr. Dkt. # 37), alleging that the plan cannot be confirmed under \u00a7 1325 because, among other reasons, it fails to provide for full payment of the Fees as a domestic support obligation over the life of the plan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The Plaintiffs filed their Complaint in this adversary proceeding the same day as the Motion to Dismiss and Objection to Confirmation (A.P. Dkt. # 1). The Plaintiffs ask the Court to declare the Fees to be (1) domestic support obligations under \u00a7\u00a7 101(14A)(A) of the Bankruptcy Code, (2) nondischargeable in this bankruptcy case pursuant to \u00a7 523(a)(5), and (3) treated as a priority claim under \u00a7\u00a7 507 and 1322(a)(2). Because of the overlap in the relief requested in the various filings, the Court consolidated the issues into this adversary proceeding to allow for a single discovery period and trial (Bankr. Dkt. # 57, 62).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    III.\n    <em>\n     CONCLUSIONS OF LAW\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Section 523 of the Bankruptcy Code outlines certain exceptions to discharge in bankruptcy proceedings.

In another analogous case, a court was called upon to determine whether fees awarded for the litigation of sexual abuse allegations against the debtor-parent, created support obligations.\n   <em>\n    Truhlar v.

Clearly, the Plaintiffs incurred the Fees in the pursuit and defense of the Orders of Protection. The purpose of those proceedings was to keep the Plaintiffs physically safe from harm and abuse by the Defendant.

The Court cannot imagine a situation\n   <em>\n    more\n   </em>\n   in the nature of actual support. The Defendant's suggestion that the Fees are not in the nature of support, and that Ms. Dumitrache should bear even a portion of the costs of protecting herself and her son against the Defendant's abuse, are patently absurd.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   IV.\n   <em>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The Plaintiffs have proven, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the state court judgments for the Fees incurred by the Plaintiffs in seeking and defending the Orders of Protection are in the nature of support pursuant to \u00a7 101(14A)(A). Accordingly, the award of $33,507.31 is nondischargeable pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 1328(a)(2) and 523(a)(5). Further, because the Fees are a domestic support obligation, the Plaintiffs' Objection to Confirmation is well-taken, and the Defendant must file an amended chapter 13 plan to treat them as such. A separate Order Sustaining the Objection to Confirmation and a separate Final Judgment will be entered simultaneously herewith. At the trial, the Plaintiffs did not pursue the Motion to Dismiss, so a separate Order Denying the Motion to Dismiss will also be entered.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    SO ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-40\">\n    All statutory references are to Title 11 of the United States Code (the \"Bankruptcy Code\"), unless otherwise indicated.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-41\">\n    To the extent any of the findings of fact are considered conclusions of law, they are adopted as such.
