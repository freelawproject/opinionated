The Debtor and the Defendants\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The Debtor is a Delaware limited liability company, as is the Debtor's sole member, LPTH. VSW Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 7, 12. The Debtor and LPTH share the same five board members: Fisher, Herring, Meltzer, Van Scotter, and Wissmann. VSW Compl. \u00b6 7. In addition to being part of the Debtor's board, Van Scotter serves as the Debtor's Chief Executive Officer and Wissmann is the Debtor's Chief Financial Officer. VSW Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 5-6. Fisher, Van Scotter, and Wissmann are also members of LPTH. VSW Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 5-6, 8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Meltzer and Herring are not members of LPTH. However, both were appointed to the Debtor's and LPTH's boards by CalPERS Corporate Partners, LLC, which is a member of LPTH. VSW Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 9-11. Meltzer is the managing partner of CalPERS's managing agent, KMCP Advisors II, LLC (\"\n   <strong>\n    KMCP\n   </strong>\n   \"). VSW Compl. \u00b6 9. In addition to being CalPERS's managing agent, KMCP is a co-founder and managing partner of Silver Canyon Group, LLC (\"\n   <strong>\n    SCG\n   </strong>\n   \"), a private equity firm that CalPERS used to facilitate a loan to the Debtor as part of the transaction in which CalPERS obtained its membership interest in LPTH. VSW Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 9-10. Herring\n   is a representative and senior advisor to SCG. VSW Compl. \u00b6 10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    II. The Boiler Explosion and the Debtor's Insurance Settlement\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Until late 2015, the Debtor operated a pulp, paper, and tissue mill in Lincoln, Maine. VSW Compl. \u00b6 12. As part of its operations, the Debtor produced its own pulp using a recovery boiler. VSW Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 13, 15. The boiler afforded the Debtor significant cost savings over its competitors by allowing the Debtor to avoid purchasing pulp from third parties and by generating enough steam power to meet approximately half of the mill's energy requirements. VSW Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 13-17.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On November 2, 2013, an explosion at the mill badly damaged the boiler, which had to be shut down. VSW Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 18-19. The Debtor had an insurance policy with Factory Mutual Insurance Company (\"\n   <strong>\n    FM Global\n   </strong>\n   \") that provided for replacement cost coverage, with an adjusted cash value provision, as well as business interruption coverage with a total limit of $ 543 million. VSW Compl. \u00b6 24. The Debtor immediately notified its insurer of the explosion, and shortly thereafter the Board Members accepted a $ 10 million insurance advance to cover the Debtors' business interruption costs. VSW Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 25-26. The Board Members obtained two estimates for the boiler's repair, which suggested that fixing the boiler would cost approximately $ 30-32 million and would take four to six months. VSW Compl. \u00b6 27. The Board Members estimated that without an operational boiler, the Debtor's earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization would drop to a loss of $ 2.9 million per month, the Debtor would not be able to retain its pre-explosion pricing structure, and the Debtor risked business interruption costs and expenses of $ 4-6 million per month. VSW Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 22-23, 26.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On December 9, 2013, the Board Members met to discuss whether to cause the Debtor's insurer to fund the boiler repair, or whether to instead negotiate a cash settlement of the Debtor's insurance claim and to continue operating the mill without the boiler. VSW Compl. \u00b6 28. The Board Members projected that if they opted to repair the boiler, LPTH and its members would not receive any distributions in 2013 or 2014. VSW Compl. \u00b6 29. Alternatively, if the Debtor pursued a cash settlement, the Board Members projected that the Debtor would likely make distributions of roughly $ 10 million to LPTH in 2014 and, possibly, 2013. VSW Compl. \u00b6 29. The Board Members did not consult with any independent advisors or consider outside opinions about the viability of their business plan to operate the mill without a functional boiler, relying solely on internal discussions and projections. VSW Compl. \u00b6 32.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The Board Members voted unanimously in favor of pursing the cash settlement. VSW Compl. \u00b6 31. On December 10, 2013, the Board Members authorized the Debtor to accept a $ 49.8 million settlement of its insurance claim, which included the $ 10 million advance that the Debtor had previously received. VSW Compl. \u00b6 33.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    III. The First Distribution\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   On December 17, 2013, the Board Members voted to authorize the Debtor to distribute $ 3 million of the insurance settlement funds to LPTH, and then to LPTH's members (the \"\n   <strong>\n    First Distribution\n   </strong>\n   \"). VSW Compl. \u00b6 35. Of that $ 3 million, Fisher, Wissmann, and Van Scotter received distributions of $ 354,759.00, $ 487,024.00, and $ 530,796.00, respectively. VSW Compl. \u00b6 36. Meltzer and Herring received no part of the distributions, however CalPERS received a distribution of $ 1,050,000.00\n   through its managing agent, KMCP. VSW Compl. \u00b6 37.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The same day that the Board Members voted to approve the First Distribution, they discussed the possibility that the Debtor would eventually need to shut down its operations at the mill due to its poor financial condition. VSW Compl. \u00b6 41. At the time that they made their decisions to accept the insurance settlement and to make the First Distribution, the Board Members also knew or should have known of various risks to the Debtor's financial health that could materialize if the boiler was not rebuilt. These included that (1) JPMorgan Chase, the Debtor's lender, considered the explosion a material adverse development that would allow JPMorgan to accelerate the Debtor's $ 20.8 million debt if the boiler was not rebuilt; (2) the Debtor would incur costs of approximately $ 10.85 million in changing its operations to accommodate the loss of the ability to produce pulp and power; and (3) the Debtor had already spent approximately $ 6 million of the settlement funds to cover business interruption costs as of December 9, 2013, and the Debtor would continue accruing such costs. VSW Compl. \u00b6 38. The Board Members also knew that if the Debtor did not rebuild the boiler, the Debtor's primary natural-gas using asset, the Debtor would not meet its minimum purchase requirement with its natural gas supplier, causing the Debtor to breach its supply contract and exposing it to $ 1 million in damages. VSW Compl. \u00b6 40. The Board Members were further aware that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission had issued an order imposing a $ 5 million penalty against the Debtor for alleged regulatory violations and demanding disgorgement of $ 379,016.00 in past payments. VSW Compl. \u00b6 39.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. The Second Distribution\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   On May 12, 2014, the Board Members convened again to discuss whether to authorize a $ 4 million distribution from the settlement funds to LPTH and to LPTH's members. VSW Compl. \u00b6 43. During that meeting, Herring asked Wissmann and Van Scotter to provide updated financial projections for the Debtor in support of the proposed distribution. VSW Compl. \u00b6 44. Wissmann and Van Scotter did not provide the updated projections. VSW Compl. \u00b6 45. Nevertheless, on May 16, 2014, a majority of the Board Members comprising Van Scotter, Wissmann, and Fisher\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   voted to authorize the Debtor to make the proposed $ 4 million distribution (the \"\n   <strong>\n    Second Distribution\n   </strong>\n   ,\" and together with the First Distribution the \"\n   <strong>\n    Distributions\n   </strong>\n   \").\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   VSW Compl. \u00b6 46. Of the $ 4 million distribution, Fisher, Wissmann, and Van Scotter received distributions of $ 475,398.00, $ 652,628.00, and $ 711,285.00, respectively. VSW Compl. \u00b6 47. CalPERS received $ 1,407,035.00 through KMCP. VSW Compl. \u00b6 48.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    V. The Release and the Debtor's Bankruptcy\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The Distributions left the Debtor in financial distress and without adequate capital. VSW Compl. \u00b6 51. Approximately seven months after the Second Distribution, the Debtor was forced to seek additional financing in order to maintain its operations. VSW Compl. \u00b6 52. On December 11,\n   2014, the Debtor entered into a set of loan agreements with Siena Lending Group LLC, pursuant to which Siena provided the Debtor with a credit line with a $ 6 million limit. VSW Compl. \u00b6 53.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The Debtor was unable to survive as a going concern, and in April 2015 it retained SSG Advisors LLC to market its business. VSW Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 54-55. SSG was unable to find a buyer. VSW Compl. \u00b6 54.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   On July 27, 2015, CalPERs entered into a Membership Assignment Agreement through which it purported to sell all of its Class C LLC Units and Membership Interest in LPTH to Van Scotter, Fisher, Wissmann, and Stanley Okoro (\"\n   <strong>\n    Okoro\n   </strong>\n   \") (a member of LPTH). MHF Compl. \u00b6 56. In connection with that transaction, CalPERS and Meltzer entered into a general, mutual release of liability with the Debtor, LPTH, Fisher, Van Scotter, Wissmann, and Okoro (the \"\n   <strong>\n    Release\n   </strong>\n   \"). MHF Compl. \u00b6 55. The Release stated that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   In consideration of the mutual covenants contained herein, and in reliance upon the agreements and releases of the parties as set forth herein, the parties, intending to be legally bound, agree as follows: ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   [CalPERS] and Meltzer, each on their behalf ... hereby irrevocably and unconditionally releases, covenants not to sue, acquits and forever discharges LPT Holding, LPT, Fisher, Okoro, Van Scotter, Wissmann ... from, regarding, and/or on account of any and all claims, debts, causes of action, liens, suits or other liabilities whatsoever, whether known or unknown, suspected or unsuspected, from the beginning of time up to and including the date of this General Release.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   General Release 1 (ECF No. 151-1). However, Meltzer provided no consideration for the Release. MHF Compl. \u00b6 55.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Two months later, on September 28, 2015, the Debtor filed a petition for relief under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code. VSW Compl. \u00b6 56.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   On September 13, 2016, the Committee began an adversary proceeding by filing a complaint against the Defendants. (ECF No. 1) (the \"\n   <strong>\n    Initial Complaint\n   </strong>\n   \"). On November 16, 2016, Meltzer and Herring moved to dismiss the Initial Complaint. (ECF No. 34.) Fisher moved to dismiss the Initial Complaint on December 5, 2016 (ECF No. 48), and on February 28, 2017, LPTH joined in the other defendants' motions to dismiss. (ECF No. 91.) On March 3, 2017, Judge Cary granted the motions and dismissed Meltzer, Herring, Fisher, and LPTH for lack of standing. (ECF No. 93.) The Committee subsequently moved for leave to assert claims against the dismissed parties on behalf of the Debtor's estate, and the Bankruptcy Court granted the Committee standing to sue Meltzer, Herring, Fisher, and LPTH on April 13, 2017.\n   <em>\n    In re Lincoln Paper &amp; Tissue, LLC\n   </em>\n   , Docket No. 15-10715 (ECF No. 980). On April 27, 2017, Fisher moved for reconsideration of the Bankruptcy Court's decision to grant the Committee standing to sue.\n   <em>\n    In re Lincoln Paper &amp; Tissue, LLC\n   </em>\n   , Docket No. 15-10715 (ECF No. 998). The Bankruptcy Court denied Fisher's motion for reconsideration during a hearing on June 20, 2017.\n   <em>\n    In re Lincoln Paper &amp; Tissue, LLC\n   </em>\n   , Docket No. 15-10715 (ECF No. 1035).\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   On April 17, 2017, the Committee commenced a separate adversary proceeding against Meltzer, Herring, Fisher, and LPTH by filing the MHF Complaint. MHF Compl. On May 30, 2017, the Committee moved to consolidate the adversary proceedings, and Judge Cary granted the motion to consolidate on July 6, 2017. In the interim, Meltzer, Herring, Fisher, and LPTH moved to withdraw the reference to this Court as to both adversary proceedings, and I temporarily stayed those motions for settlement negotiations.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Meltzer v. Official Comm. of Unsecured Creditors\n   </em>\n   , Docket No. 1:17-mc-144 (ECF Nos. 1, 6). During the run of that stay, on September 19, 2017, the Committee filed a First Amended Complaint against Van Scotter and Wissmann, which included limited amendments to the Initial Complaint's factual allegations and which added a claim for breach of the duty of loyalty.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   VSW Compl.

The Committee insists that insolvency does not change the character of the directors' fiduciary duties, and that it is relevant only to the question of whether creditors have standing to bring derivative actions on a company's behalf. It is true that insolvency does not change the character of the directors' fiduciary duties. Regardless of an entity's solvency, its directors owe a fiduciary duty to the entity to maximize its value for the benefit of its residual interest-holders. That duty is unchanging. But insolvency is not merely relevant to the issue of standing.

The Committee does not raise any plausible inference that the Board Members acted disloyally in the traditional, self-interested sense. The Committee alleges that the Distributions were first made to LPTH, the Debtor's sole member. Therefore, there is no claim that the Distributions' benefits were distributed unequally among the Debtor's shareholders.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Further, the fact that LPTH passed funds from the Distributions on to Van Scotter, Wissmann, Fisher, and CalPERS does not suffice to allege that the Board Members engaged in self-dealing.

And even if I ignored that the Distributions passed through LPTH-a separate legal entity-before reaching LPTH's members, the Committee has not alleged that any of the Board Members received a personal benefit not received by other shareholders of\n   LPTH.\n   <em>\n    Cede &amp; Co. v.

Drawing reasonable inferences in the Committee's favor, the Complaints allege that despite knowing that the boiler was significant to the Debtor's ongoing financial health and despite substantial insurance coverage which could have covered replacement and compensated for business interruption losses, the Board Members made their decision to forgo rebuilding the boiler in order to ensure that LPTH and its members (including themselves, in the case of Van Scotter, Wissmann, and Fisher) would receive cash distributions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   VSW Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 29, 32. The Complaints also allege that one week after deciding not to rebuild the boiler, the Board Members voted to distribute funds to LPTH even though they were aware at that time that the Debtor's mill was in a precarious financial condition. VSW Compl. \u00b6 41. On the alleged facts, an inference can be drawn that at the time of these decisions, the Board Members knew that the mill might eventually need to be shut down. Further, the Complaints allege that Van Scotter, Wissmann, and Fisher voted to make a second Distribution to LPTH without reviewing updated financial projections for the Debtor. VSW Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 44-46. Taken together, these allegations suggest that the Board Members elected to take funds from the Debtor in order to ensure LPTH's-or their own-short-term access to cash, and in doing so acted to benefit LPTH and its members knowing that doing so was to the Debtor's detriment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   What the Committee does not allege is that the Board Members knew their choices would cause the Debtor to fail as a going concern or that they purposefully set out to defraud the Debtor's creditors.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Stone\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8402527\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/911/362/#p369\">\n    911 A.2d at 369\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (to rise to the level of bad faith, misconduct must be intentional). There are no allegations about the Debtor's assets, and only spotty allegations about the Debtor's liabilities. Remember that it is acceptable, even required, for the directors of a solvent wholly-owned subsidiary to serve its parent's interests, and that the Committee has clarified that it is not claiming that the Debtor became insolvent when the Distributions were made. While the Committee attempts to draw a straight line between the initial decision not to rebuild the boiler and the Debtor's insolvency, those events were separated by a span of two years. And while the Committee points to various costs and debts that the Board Members knew or should have\n   known would accrue if they chose not to rebuild the boiler or to make the Distributions, the Complaints do not allege that the Board Members also knew that the Debtor would be unable to absorb those costs. The Committee's counsel hinted at the oral argument before the Bankruptcy Court that he had uncovered additional evidence that supports a claim of intentional misconduct. He has not moved to amend the Complaints, and without facts to support it, the theory is not adequately plead.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   In light of the foregoing, I find that the Complaints fail to state a claim against the Board Members for breach of the duty of loyalty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Whether the Committee Has Stated a Claim for Breach of the Duty of Care against Meltzer and Herring\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   Meltzer and Herring argue that the Committee's claims against them for breach of the duty of care should be dismissed because the Committee has failed to allege that they engaged in grossly negligent conduct. Meltzer and Herring note that the Committee's allegations largely support a conclusion that the Board Members endeavored to inform themselves before deciding not to rebuild the boiler and before the First Distribution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   Setting aside the Board Members' initial decision to accept a cash insurance settlement and to make the First Distribution, the Committee alleges that when the Board Members were considering the Second Distribution, Herring asked Van Scotter and Wissmann to provide updated financial projections for the Debtor to support those distributions. VSW Compl. \u00b6 44. The Committee further alleges that Van Scotter and Wissmann did not provide those materials but that Van Scotter, Wissmann, and Fisher nevertheless went forward with the vote on that distribution. VSW Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 45-46. In light of the Debtor's purportedly tenuous financial condition, this alleged failure to obtain or to consider updated projections before making the Second Distribution is enough to suggest gross negligence and to support a claim for breach of the duty of care.\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   The critical question becomes, then, whether this lapse can be imputed to Meltzer and Herring.

Judge Cary, who ruled a day after the hearing, did not refer back specifically to the comments of Committee counsel in making his order, and the claim of judicial \"acceptance\" is wobbly at best. Accordingly, I conclude that the Committee is not judicially estopped from raising a bad-faith based claim at this juncture.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"18\">\n   <p id=\"p-121\">\n    Unlike the duty of loyalty, the duty of care is process-based.
