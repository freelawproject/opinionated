To Mr. DeFreze's apparent surprise, on January 28, 2018, the New York State Department of Taxation and Finance (\"NYSDTF\") mailed to him a \"notice of adjusted assessment.\" (ECF No. 23, Ex. F). Despite the chapter 7 discharge, NYSDTF demanded that Mr. DeFreze pay $16,970.85 for tax year 2008. (\n  <em>\n   Id.\n  </em>\n  ). In response, Mr. DeFreze filed a motion seeking a determination that the tax obligation owed to NYSDTF was discharged.\n  <footnotemark>\n   1\n  </footnotemark>\n  NYSDTF countered by arguing that\n  <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20523\">\n   11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523\n  </extracted-citation>\n  (a)(1)(B)(i) or (ii) operate to make Mr. DeFreze's 2008 New York State taxes nondischargeable.\n </attorneys>\n <attorneys id=\"p-9\">\n  Because Mr. DeFreze's New York State Form IT-201 filed in 2008 was not a \"return\" for bankruptcy purposes and because he filed this bankruptcy case less than 2 years after he late-filed his amended 2008 New York State tax return, the unpaid income taxes due for tax year 2008 were not discharged in bankruptcy by operation of\n  <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20523\">\n   11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523\n  </extracted-citation>\n  (a)(1)(B)(i) or (ii).

W.D.N.Y. 2018) (Warren, J.). As tempting as it is to simply deny the motion because of its many procedural flaws, NYSDTF is entitled to have the Court make a determination, to end this saga and prevent further litigation. At oral argument, NYSDTF consented to jurisdiction. (ECF No. 34). NYSDTF also moved to have the motion treated as a complaint and the reply treated as an answer. NYSDTF then moved for a judgment on the pleadings, under Rule 12(c) FRCP.\n  </p>\n </footnote>\n <opinion type=\"majority\">\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    JURISDICTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The Court has jurisdiction under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20157\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 157\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), 157(b)(1), and 1334(b).

The plain language of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20523\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) (*), added by BAPCPA to define the term tax \"return\" for bankruptcy discharge purposes, coupled with the substantial body of circuit court case law interpreting the BAPCPA definition of tax \"return\" for purposes of dischargeability-or nondischargeability-of taxes under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20523\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1)(B), provides the short answer: No.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    III.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Mr. DeFreze was required to file his 2008 New York State income tax return by April 15, 2009. (ECF No. 30, Affirmation, \u00b6 3). He did not mail that return until June 18, 2009, according to the postmark. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 4). The late-filed return was not signed or dated, which defect was corrected by Mr. DeFreze on July 6, 2009. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 5-6). As Mr. DeFreze sees things, that's the end of the story for purposes of the two-year reach-back under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20523\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1)(B)(ii). (ECF No. 23, \u00b6\u00b6 33-37). But there is a little more to the story, of course.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The IRS eventually audited Mr. DeFreze's 2008 federal tax return and discovered that he had underreported his gross income by quite a sizeable amount. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 10). Mr. DeFreze took an appeal of the IRS determination to the United States Tax Court. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 12). On July 14, 2015, the Tax Court entered a Decision and Order finding that Mr. DeFreze had underreported his 2008 gross income by $108,377. (ECF No. 23, \u00b6 12 &amp; Ex. C; ECF No. 30, Affirmation, \u00b6 7). Under New York law, Mr. DeFreze was required to file an amended state tax return within 90 days of entry of the Tax Court Order. (ECF No. 30, \u00b6 34; NY Tax Law \u00a7 659 ). Mr. DeFreze failed to file an amended state tax return with NYSDTF for tax year 2008 within the time required by state law. (ECF No. 30, \u00b6\u00b6 34-37).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On October 28, 2015, Mr. DeFreze late-filed his amended 2008 New York State income tax return, reporting-for the first time-his 2008 gross income as determined by the IRS. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , Affirmation, \u00b6 9). As a result, NYSDTF issued a notice assessing $18,544.60 in additional income taxes for tax year 2008. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , Affirmation, \u00b6\u00b6 10-12 &amp; Ex. A). One year and eleven months later, on September 30, 2017, Mr. DeFreze filed this chapter 7 case. (ECF No. 1). Puzzlingly-and troublingly-Mr. DeFreze did not mention the 2008 tax obligation on Schedule E/F (or anywhere else in his bankruptcy schedules), although he did schedule a small tax debt owed to\n   NYSDTF for his 2015 state income taxes.

If not, the 2008 Form IT-201 was not a \"return\" for purposes of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20523\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1)(B) and the taxes would be nondischargeable under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20523\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1)(B)(i).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   There is no dispute here that Mr. DeFreze filed the 2008 New York tax return months after its statutory due date, not signed under penalty of perjury, and under-disclosing his gross income by over $100,000. It was only after an audit by the IRS in 2014-culminating in a July 14, 2015 Tax Court determination that Mr. DeFreze had failed to report $108,377 in gross income for 2008-that Mr. DeFreze undertook to file an amended return for tax year 2008 with NYSDTF. (ECF No. 23, \u00b6\u00b6 10, 12-16). And, under New York Tax Law \u00a7 659, Mr. DeFreze filed his amended return after the statutory deadline. (ECF No. 30, \u00b6\u00b6 35-37). But, Mr. DeFreze argues that the Court should disregard the amended return and focus only on the 2008 IT-201, filed in July 2009, for purposes of measuring the two-year nondischargeability period under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20523\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1)(B)(ii). (ECF No. 23, \u00b6\u00b6 34-37). In other words, Mr. DeFreze argues that as long as he filed the right New York\n   <em>\n    tax form\n   </em>\n   , it matters not what information that form contained or, more to the point, what information that form failed to provide. As Mr. DeFreze sees it, as of July 2009, he had filed a \"return,\" so the October 2015 amended return was of no consequence for purposes of the two-year look-back under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20523\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1)(B)(ii).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Mr. DeFreze's position has been rejected by the majority of circuit courts. The majority of circuits have held that, in assessing the honesty and reasonableness of the taxpayer's actions under the fourth\n   <em>\n    Beard\n   </em>\n   factor, \"the relevant time frame is the entire time frame of the taxpayer's action (and inaction), which of course includes the time from the taxpayer's delinquency through the time when the belated return is filed.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Justice\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4259964,6812077\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/817/738/\">\n    817 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   744-45 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Giacchi\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12270640,12276693\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/856/244/\">\n    856 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   248 n.17 (collecting supporting authorities). \"Forms filed after their due dates and after an IRS assessment rarely, if ever, qualify as an honest or reasonable attempt to satisfy the tax law.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Giacchi\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12270640,12276693\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/856/244/\">\n    856 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   248 (citing\n   <em>\n    In re Moroney\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9066248,9298362\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/352/902/\">\n    352 F.3d 902\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 905-06 (4th Cir. 2003) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Here, it was not until October 28, 2015 that Mr. DeFreze filed a New York IT-201-X, disclosing for the first time, his true and correct gross income for tax year 2008. (ECF No. 30, Affirmation, \u00b6 9). That \"amended\" IT-201-X, disclosing over $108,000 of previously undisclosed gross income, was filed by Mr. DeFreze only after the IRS had performed an audit and only after the Tax Court had issued a decision for tax year 2008. And, under New York Tax Law \u00a7 659, Mr. DeFreze filed that amended IT-201-X beyond the statutorily mandated due date. The report required by New York Tax Law \u00a7 659 was neither filed nor given within the time required by New York law. Mr. DeFreze did not make an honest and reasonable effort to satisfy the requirements of New York Tax Law. Under the fourth prong of the\n   <em>\n    Beard\n   </em>\n   test, Mr. DeFreze's late-filed 2008 New York State Form IT-201-X was not a \"return\" for purposes of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20523\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1)(B). The taxes due NYSDTF for 2008 are nondischargeable under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20523\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1)(B)(i).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Alternatively and additionally, under the facts at hand, the Court finds that\n   <extracted-citation index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20523\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1)(B)(ii) is an impediment to discharge of Mr. DeFreze's 2008 New York State tax debt. Mr. DeFreze's late-filed \"amended\" New York State Form IT-201-X for tax year 2008 was \"a return,\n   <em>\n    or equivalent report or notice\n   </em>\n   \" required by New York law that was \"\n   <em>\n    filed or given after the due date\n   </em>\n   \" and within two years of the filing of the bankruptcy case.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20523\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1)(B)(ii). The late-filing of that required \"equivalent report or notice\" would also serve as a basis to find that Mr. DeFreze's 2008 tax obligation to NYSDTF was not discharged under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20523\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1)(B)(ii), because this bankruptcy case was filed less than two years after the amended return was filed-and only after the IRS had made an assessment and only after the Tax Court had entered its order. And there is more here to convince the Court that Mr. DeFreze did not make an honest and reasonable effort to comply with the tax law, under the fourth prong of the\n   <em>\n    Beard\n   </em>\n   test. The original New York State Form IT-201 for tax year 2008 was filed two months late, it was not signed by the taxpayers, and critically, it failed to disclose all of Mr. DeFreze's gross income-omitting mention of over $108,000 in gross income. Those serious shortcomings are compounded by the fact that Mr. DeFreze did not mention those same 2008 New York State personal income taxes in the bankruptcy petition filed with this Court. The Court holds that, by operation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20523\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1)(B)(i) or, alternatively,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20523\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1)(B)(ii), Mr. DeFreze's 2008 tax obligation to NYSDTF is nondischargeable in bankruptcy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   As a last-ditch effort, Mr. DeFreze argues that injuries he sustained in a 2005 motorcycle crash were the cause of his forgetting to disclose his correct gross income\n   in 2008. (ECF No. 23, \u00b6 5-6, 38). But, Mr. DeFreze admits that he continued to work after recovering from his injuries. He was working during 2008 and continued to do so until he retired. (ECF No. 23, \u00b6 7). Mr. DeFreze does not claim that the injuries he sustained in 2005 prevented him from continuing his business affairs. \"[A] taxpayer's illness or incapacity generally does not prevent the taxpayer from filing returns where the taxpayer is able to continue his business affairs despite the illness or incapacity.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Selbst\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5886773\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/544/289/#p296\">\n    544 B.R. 289\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 296 (Bankr.
