Hill (\"Ms. Hill,\" collectively, the \"Debtors\"), against the defendant, LG Funding LLC (\"LG Funding\"), to recover alleged preferential and constructively fraudulent transfers pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20547\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 547\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b) and 548(a)(1)(B), and to disallow claims against the bankruptcy estate filed by LG Funding pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20502\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 502\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d). For the reasons that follow, judgment is granted in favor of LG Funding on all three counts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The following facts are derived from the parties' Joint List of Stipulated Facts and Documents [Dkt. 50] and the evidence heard at trial on May 24, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Network Salon was a distributor of beauty products founded in 2004 by Ms. Hill's husband, Brian Hill; it was located in Chicago, Illinois. While Mr. Hill managed the business and its financial affairs, Ms. Hill performed warehouse and shipping work for the business. At that time, Ms. Hill neither owned nor managed any part of the business. Until 2010, Network Salon struggled financially, which required Mr. Hill to work elsewhere to keep the company and his family afloat.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In 2011, Ms. Hill took over the operation of Network Salon following the brief illness and subsequent death of Mr. Hill. Ms. Hill had no business or financial training or experience prior to taking over the business. At first Ms. Hill was able to effectively run the business. However, it ran into problems accessing products and selling them profitably. She soon became overwhelmed by the financial issues that both her family and Network Salon were experiencing and could not obtain traditional loans through various lenders.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   She received a solicitation from Merchant Capital Advance, a merchant cash advance firm, telling her she could access $250,000 by submitting bank records. That deal went through; $250,000 was transferred into the business' bank account and $1090 payments were taken out of the business' account on a daily basis pursuant to that transaction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   LG Funding is a New York commercial finance company engaged in the merchant cash advance (\"MCA\") business. The MCA industry provides working capital to businesses, particularly small businesses who suffered financially as a result of the 2008 financial crisis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In an MCA transaction, the merchant sells its accounts receivable for a discounted amount that is paid by the MCA company up-front. The MCA company, as purchaser, recovers the receivables by taking a pre-determined percentage of the merchant's receipts until the MCA company is paid in full.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Network Salon and LG Funding entered into two MCA transactions within two years prior to the date that Network Salon and Ms. Hill filed their chapter 7 bankruptcy petitions on May 20, 2016, (\"the Petition Date\"). The first contract is dated November 3, 2015 (the \"First Agreement\"); the second is dated January 8, 2016 (the \"Second Agreement,\" collectively, the \"Agreements\"). Each agreement was made using LG Funding's standard form contract; each agreement was signed by Ms. Hill as owner of Network Salon. Ms. Hill also signed personal guaranties in connection with each transaction. Each agreement contains the following terms describing the nature of the transactions:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   Merchant hereby sells, assigns, and transfers to LG (making LG the absolute owner) in consideration of the funds provided (\"Purchase Price\") specified below, all of Merchant's future accounts, contract rights and other obligations arising from or relating to the payment of monies from Merchant's customers' [sic] and/or third party payors (the \"Receipts\" defined as all payments made by cash, check, credit or debit card, electronic transfer or other form of monetary payment in the ordinary course of the merchant's business), for the payment of Merchant's sale of goods or services until the amount specified below (the \"Purchased Amount\") has been delivered by Merchant to LG.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   The Purchased Amount shall be paid to LG by Merchant's irrevocably authorizing only one depositing account acceptable to LG (the \"Account\") to remit the percentage specified below (the \"Specified Percentage\") of the Merchant's settlement amounts due from each transaction, until such time as LG receives payment in full of the Purchased Amount.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   1.9 Sale of Receipts. Merchant and LG agree that the Purchase Price under this Agreement is in exchange for the Purchased Amount and that such Purchase Price\n   <strong>\n    is not intended to be, nor shall it be construed as a loan from LG to Merchant.\n   </strong>\n   Merchant agrees that the Purchase Price is in exchange for the Receipts pursuant to this Agreement equals the fair market value of such Receipts.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Trustee's Exs. 18 and 28 (emphasis added). Each agreement contains a choice of law provision which selects New York law as the governing law of the contract.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Paragraph 4.5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   In total, LG Funding paid Network Salon $125,000 to purchase an interest in a percentage of Network Salon's receivables; in return, Network Salon became obligated to pay LG Funding $176,432. Network Salon granted LG Funding access to a specific bank account, from which LG Funding could, pursuant to the Agreements, make debits to obtain funds due it. LG Funding was also allowed access to Network Salon's operating account. Transcript, p. 14. Under the First Agreement, LG Funding could debit no more than $3,999 from Network Salon's bank account each week. After debiting a $1,500 administrative fee from Network Salon's account on November 9, 2015, LG Funding debited $3,999 from the account each week from November 16, 2015 through March 28, 2016. Under the Second Agreement, LG Funding debited an additional $2,500 from Network Salon's account each week. Thus, from January 19,\n   2016 through March 28, 2016, LG Funding was debiting a total of $6,499 each week from Network Salon's account. During the ninety days preceding the Petition Date, LG Funding debited $38,994 from the account (the \"Transfers\"). Overall, Network Salon remitted $112,979 to LG Funding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Overall, Ms. Hill entered into MCA agreements with at least thirteen MCA businesses, including LG Funding, in order to continue operation of Network Salon and to support her family from January 2013 until the Petition Date. In the six months prior to filing the instant bankruptcy case, Network Salon owed money to at least seven different MCA companies pursuant to multiple agreements. As of November 3, 2015, there were eleven UCC-1 financing statements filed against Network Salon in the office of the Illinois Secretary of State.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   By March 2016, Network Salon was paying MCA providers over $30,000 each business day out of fourteen different bank accounts maintained by Network Salon. The capital that Network Salon obtained under the MCA transactions was often used to pay off other MCA transactions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   On May 20, 2016, the Petition Date, Network Salon and Ms. Hill filed petitions under chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code; an order was entered for joint administration of the estates. The Trustee was appointed to administer the estates. This adversary proceeding was commenced by the Trustee against LG Funding to recover funds transferred by Network Salon to LG Funding pursuant to the Agreements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    II. JURISDICTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The federal district courts have original and exclusive jurisdiction of all cases under the Bankruptcy Code, title 11 of the U.S. Code.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201334\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1334\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a).

Count I - Preferential Transfer\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   In Count I of the adversary complaint, the Trustee alleges that the payments that Network Salon made to LG Funding under the agreements constituted\n   preferential transfers within the meaning of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20547\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 547\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b). \"The provision for recovering preferences is integrally bound up in the overall scheme for ensuring equitable distribution among creditors....

This statutory provision provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   (b) Except as provided in subsections (c) and (i) of this section, the trustee may avoid any transfer of an interest of the debtor in property-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   (1) to or for the benefit of a creditor;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   (2) for or on account of an antecedent debt owed by the debtor before such transfer was made;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   (3) made while the debtor was insolvent;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   (4) made-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   (A) on or within 90 days before the date of the filing of the petition; or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   (B) between ninety days and one year before the date of the filing of the petition, if such creditor at the time of such transfer was an insider; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   (5) that enables such creditor to receive more than such creditor would receive if-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   (A) the case were a case under chapter 7 of this title;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   (B) the transfer has not been made; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   (C) such creditor received payment of such debt to the extent provided by the provisions of this title.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20547\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 547\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   The Trustee asserts that the alleged preferential transfers were made within ninety days prior to the Petition Date, pursuant to \u00a7 547(b)(4)(A). Certain seemingly preferential transactions are excluded from avoidance under \u00a7 547(b), however, as codified in subsection (c). Specifically, LG Funding pursues the defense found in subsection (c)(2), which provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   (c) The trustee may not avoid under this section any transfer-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   (2) to the extent that such transfer was in payment of a debt incurred by the debtor in the ordinary course of business or financial affairs of the debtor and the transferee, and such transfer was-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   (A) made in the ordinary course of business or financial affairs of the debtor and the transferee; or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   (B) made according to ordinary business terms[.]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20547\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 547\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(2)(A) and (B).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   As a threshold matter, LG Funding argues that it was not a creditor, and that the payments were not received from Network Salon due to an antecedent debt. LG Funding asserts that under New York law, MCA contracts represent the sale of accounts receivable; they are not considered to be loans. In turn, the Trustee argues that the transactions constituted criminally usurious loans, due to the high interest rates of the transactions, and further that LG Funding has admitted that the transactions were loans during this litigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   There are many cases which support the proposition that the agreements between LG Funding and Network Salon are not loans.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   <em>\n    Wilkinson Floor Covering, Inc., v.

In fact, in litigation in which LG Funding has been involved, New York courts describe the money owed by a merchant in a cash advance transaction as a debt.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    LG Funding, LLC v.

July 15, 2015) (\"Along with FTI, Cartaya has not paid the debt owed by FTI and thus has breached that guaranty.\") Further, the Bankruptcy Code defines a debt as a liability on a claim.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20101\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (12). A \"claim\" within the meaning of the Bankruptcy Code is either a \"right to payment, whether or not such right is reduced to judgment, liquidated, unliquidated, fixed, contingent, matured, unmatured, disputed, undisputed, legal, equitable, secured or unsecured\" or a \"right to an equitable remedy for breach of performance if such breach gives rise to a right to payment[.]\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20101\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (5). LG Funding does not argue that it had no right to payment, and, in fact, argues the opposite-- that it had the right to debit Network Salon's account under the Agreements. Thus, while New York law does not define the Agreements as loans, the transactions created a debt that Network Salon owed to LG Funding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   The Trustee's assertion that the Debtors' transactions with LG are usurious and for that reason are either fraudulent or not ordinary is mistaken. The Agreements state that New York law governs their enforcement and interpretation. New York law provides that a person is guilty of the fraud crime of criminal usury in the second degree, a class E felony when:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n   not being authorized or permitted by law to do so, he knowingly charges, takes or receives any money or other property as interest on the loan or forbearance of any money or other property, at a rate exceeding twenty-five per centum per annum or the equivalent rate for a longer or shorter period.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.Y.%20PENAL%20LAW%20%C2%A7%20190.40\">\n    N.Y.

In fact, no evidence was presented to show that LG Funding engaged in any other type of financing. LG Funding purchased a portion of Network Salon's future receivables.

The Trustee argues that it was not in the ordinary course of business for Network Salon to enter into this type of debt because the business was struggling financially and that its desperation for capital caused it to enter into these agreements. Network Salon began entering into merchant cash advance transactions with other MCAs in January of 2013, nearly two years before Network Salon entered into the Agreements with LG Funding. Throughout that period, Network Salon regularly did business with other MCA companies; in fact, Network Salon entered into MCA transactions with fourteen different MCA companies; Network Salon had fourteen bank accounts.

Due to the length of time and the consistency of Network Salon entering into these kinds of transactions, the court finds that entering into these types of transactions became a normal, ordinary part of Network Salon's business. Thus, the Agreements were entered into within the ordinary course of business from the perspective of both parties. The first element of the ordinary course of business defense has been satisfied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   When LG Funding entered into the Agreements Network Salon was the subject of 11 UCC-1 filings by other entities. According to New York law, \"[A] transferee of funds from a deposit account takes the funds free of a security interest in the deposit account unless the transferee acts in collusion with the debtor in violating the rights of the secured party.\" N.Y.U.C.C.

The Trustee's position is that under the Agreements, LG Funding could take only funds which Network Salon had received \"for the payment of Merchant's sale of goods or services.\" Paragraph 1.9 - Sale of Receipts term of Agreements. Trustee's Exs. 18 and 28. The Trustee contends that the funds LG Funding debited from Network Salon's account were derived from other lenders and MCA companies when the Agreements state that \"Payments made to LG in respect to the full amount of the Receipts shall be conditioned upon Merchant's sale of products and services and the payment therefore by Merchant's customers in the manner provided in Section 1.1.\" Paragraph 1.1 provides that the Merchant shall appoint a bank to obtain electronic fund transfer services and allow LG Funding to deduct amounts owed it from settlement amounts otherwise due to the Merchant from electronic transactions, to pay LG Funding by allowing it to withdraw funds by debiting the account.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   In response to the Trustee's argument, LG Funding asserts that the argument should be rejected as the Trustee did not assert this theory until shortly before trial, after the close of discovery. At trial, LG Funding argued the theory on its merits, stating that money is fungible and, therefore, as long as Network Salon was receiving income from its goods and services, LG Funding could debit the account that it was given access to, regardless of where the funds in that particular account originated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   Both Network Salon and LG Funding deviated from the contract term allowing LG Funding access to certain funds. Network Salon deposited funds from other MCAs into the account LG Funding had access to and LG took those other funds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   The Trustee argues that this is similar to cases where courts have ruled that transactions based on fraud are not ordinary and for that reason creditors can not stand on the ordinary course defense.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Computer World Solution, Inc. v.

The court notes that the Trustee has not presented legal authority regarding whether deviations from contract terms in this manner vitiates the defense. Both Network Salon and LG Funding benefitted from this.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   This court agrees with well-settled precedent that money is fungible.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Boyer v.

Neither the creditors nor Network Salon were prejudiced by how the payments were made. In addition, the evidence shows that the MCA entities that Network Salon dealt with regularly funded each others' payments and agreements when Ms. Hill deposited funds into accounts dedicated to other MCAs. This satisfies the \"term of the industry element\" in section 547(c)(2)(B). The Debtors were able to stay in business and support Ms. Hill's family from 2013 to 2016 using MCAs. Their dire circumstances were unfortunate, however, the transactions did not amount to fraud on the part of Debtors or LG Funding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   Since the court agrees with LG Funding on the merits, it will not reach the issue of whether the Trustee's argument on this issue was raised in a timely manner.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   LG Funding provided capital in the amount of $125,000 to Network Salon. In return, Network Salon granted LG Funding an interest in a percentage of its receivables. The terms of the Agreements provided that Network Salon would remit payment of the receivables \"until the amount specified below (the \"Purchased Amount\") has been delivered by Merchant to LG.\" In order for LG Funding to collect this amount, the contract also dictated the method of payment: \"The Purchased Amount shall be paid to LG by Merchant's irrevocably authorizing only one depositing account acceptable to LG ... to remit the percentage specified below ... of the Merchant's settlement amounts due from each transaction, until such time as LG receives payment in full of the Purchased Amount.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Trustee's Exs. 18 and 28.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   Pursuant to these terms, LG Funding debited money from Network Salon's bank account to recover the purchased receivables up to the specified amount under the Agreements. The parties in this matter were engaged in MCA transactions for nearly five months, from November 9, 2015 through March 28, 2016, during which time Network Salon remitted funds to satisfy its obligations under the terms of the Agreements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   LG Funding operates in the MCA industry, entering into MCA agreements on a regular basis. Network Salon, through Ms. Hill, began obtaining capital through MCA agreements nearly two years prior to entering into the agreements with LG Funding. Once the Agreements were signed, they were performed, in large part, according to their terms over the span of a few months. The court finds that the transfers to LG Funding were made in the ordinary course of business of the Network\n   Salon and LG Funding; the second element of this defense has been satisfied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   The Trustee's \u00a7 547(b) claim under Count I must be denied because the transfers were made in the ordinary course of the parties' business and financial affairs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   <strong>\n    C.

LG Funding could debit up to 15% of Network Salon's receivables until the total amount of $176,432 was paid. Pursuant to the Agreements, Network Salon transferred $112,979 in total to LG Funding. This amount was transferred to LG Funding through automatic debits by LG Funding of Network Salon's account(s). The debits occurred approximately once a week from November 9, 2015 through March 28, 2016.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def's Ex. 2. Overall, Network Salon received $125,000 from LG Funding, but only gave value of $112,979 in return.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   The Agreements provide that LG Funding paid fair market value for Network Salon's receivables. They state that: \"Merchant agrees that the Purchase Price is in exchange for the Receipts pursuant to this Agreement equals the fair market value of such Receipts.\" Trustee's Exs. 18 and 28, \u00b6\u00b6 1.9 in each Agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   The court finds that each Agreement was formed in good faith. LG Funding assumed the risk of non-payment; if Network Salon ceased producing income, LG Funding could not have been paid. LG Funding did not order or require the Debtors to put the proceeds of other MCA transactions into the accounts LG Funding had access to.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   Based on the evidence presented, the court finds that Network Salon received reasonably equivalent value under the Agreements.
