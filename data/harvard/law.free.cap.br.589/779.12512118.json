Dow, Jr., United States District Judge\n   This case is on appeal from the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of Illinois, Eastern Division, Case No. 17-11668. Appellant Glenn Stearns, Chapter 13 Trustee (\"Trustee\"), appeals from the Bankruptcy Court's order and memorandum opinion dated December 27, 2017, denying the Trustee's motion to dismiss the case of Christopher V. Pratola (\"Debtor\") pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201307\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1307\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   For the reasons set forth below, the Bankruptcy Court's order denying the Trustee's motion is reversed, and this matter is remanded to the Bankruptcy Court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On April 13, 2017, Debtor filed a voluntary petition in the bankruptcy court under Chapter 13 of the Bankruptcy Code. See N.D. Ill. Bankr. Case No. 17-11668, Docket Entry 1. According to \u00a7 109(e) of the Bankruptcy Code, which defines who is eligible to file bankruptcy under Chapter 13, \"[o]nly an individual with regular income that owes, on the date of the filing of the petition, noncontingent, liquidated, unsecured debts of less than $394,725\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   and noncontingent, liquidated, secured debts of less than $1,184,200 * * * may be a debtor under chapter 13 of this title.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The Debtor's original Schedule E/F filed with the petition listed $217,115 in general unsecured debt. N.D. Ill. Bankr. Case No. 17-11668, Docket Entry 1, at 27. This debt consisted of $194,563 in student loan debt owed to \"Aes/Chase Bank\" and \"Aes/Nct\" as well as $22,552 in credit card debt owed to various creditors.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201307\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , at 20-27. Debtor then filed an amended Schedule E/F that same day which added to Debtor's general unsecured debt $374,108 in federal student loans.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201307\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , Docket Entry 8, at 6. This debt is serviced by Federal Loan Servicing, and Debtor is repaying it pursuant to an Income Based Repayment (\"IBR\") agreement with Federal Student Aid. Under this agreement, Debtor makes monthly payments on the debt equal to 10% of his discretionary income for a term of twenty-five years. Upon completion of these payments, any remaining balance on the loans will be forgiven. However, if Debtor defaults, the entire remaining balance will become due.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201307\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , Docket Entry 23, at 4. Debtor designated this federal student loan debt as both contingent and disputed in his amended Schedule E/F.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201307\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , Docket Entry 8, at 6. Debtor's amended Schedule E/F thus listed $374,108 in disputed and contingent unsecured debt and $217,115 in undisputed, noncontingent, unsecured debt, for a total of $591,223.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On April 20, 2017, the Trustee moved to dismiss Debtor's case pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20109\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 109\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e) and 1307(c). See N.D. Ill. Bankr. Case No. 17-11668, Docket Entry 17. Specifically, the Trustee argued that Debtor was ineligible for Chapter 13 relief because he owed unsecured debts in excess of \u00a7 109(e)'s $394,725 unsecured debt limit. According to the Trustee, owing debt in excess of the statutory limit warrants dismissal\n   for cause under \u00a7\u00a7 109(e) and 1307(c) of the Bankruptcy Code. Debtor filed a response to the motion, arguing that his $374,108 in federal student loan debt was contingent because it is subject to IBR repayment and could be forgiven before he has to pay the full amount. See\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20109\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , Docket Entry 23. Only noncontingent debt is considered in determining a debtor's eligibility based on \u00a7 109(e)'s unsecured debt limit. \u00a7 109(e). Therefore, Debtor argued, this debt should not be included in a determination of his Chapter 13 eligibility. Without this federal student loan, Debtor's unsecured debt would be well below \u00a7 109(e)'s limits. Debtor made no other arguments in response to the Trustee's motion, and he conceded that if his federal student loan debt were considered noncontingent, he would be ineligible for Chapter 13 relief. See\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20109\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20109\">\n    at 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The Bankruptcy Court issued an order on December 27, 2017, denying the Trustee's motion to dismiss \"for lack of cause under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201307\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1307\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c).\" See N.D. Ill. Bankr. Case No. 17-11668, Docket Entry 39. In its accompanying memorandum opinion, the Bankruptcy Court first determined that the Debtor's student loan debt subject to an IBR agreement was noncontingent because he has a current duty to pay back this debt, notwithstanding the possibility of forgiveness that the IBR payment plan may offer in the future. Docket Entry 38, at 4-6. The Bankruptcy Court then turned to the issue of whether \u00a7 1307(c), which provides that a Chapter 13 case may be converted or dismissed for cause, requires dismissal of a Chapter 13 case if the inclusion of educational debt causes a debtor to exceed the \u00a7 109(e) unsecured debt limit. The Bankruptcy Court held that it does not.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201307\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201307\">\n    at 6-13\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   After noting that ineligibility under \u00a7 109(e) is usually cause for dismissal or conversion of a Chapter 13 case but is not an absolute bar, the Bankruptcy Court concluded that it was without clear direction from either the Bankruptcy Code or case law as to whether cause for dismissal under \u00a7 1307(c) exists in this situation.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201307\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201307\">\n    at 7\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Based on this perceived ambiguity, the Bankruptcy Court turned to legislative history and policy considerations regarding educational debt to determine whether Debtor's case should be dismissed. The Bankruptcy Court concluded that based on the history surrounding the debt limits' enactment, Congress could not have intended to exclude someone like Debtor, an otherwise eligible individual exceeding \u00a7 109(e)'s unsecured debt limit solely because of educational debt, from Chapter 13 relief. The Bankruptcy Court also noted that the failure of the unsecured debt limit to account for the changing nature and increasing amount of educational debt in the United States creates an absurd situation for individuals like Debtor, who could be ineligible for Chapter 13 relief despite being best suited for it.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201307\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201307\">\n    at 9-12\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Based on these considerations, the Bankruptcy Court held that there was no cause for dismissal of Debtor's Chapter 13 case under \u00a7 1307(c). The Bankruptcy Court specifically noted that \"[d]ismissing [Debtor's] case would not advance the Congressional intent behind the debt limits, and doing so would hinder the principal purpose of the Bankruptcy Code-to grant a 'fresh start' to the honest but unfortunate debtor.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201307\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201307\">\n    at 12\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citation omitted). The Bankruptcy Court determined that its decision declining to dismiss the case advanced the best interests of the creditors and the estate because Debtor would be able to continue making payments on his educational debt and pay other general unsecured creditors a percentage of their claims; dismissal or conversion to Chapter 7 or Chapter 11 would not necessarily lead to that same outcome.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201307\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201307\">\n    at 13\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The Trustee filed this appeal on January 11, 2018, [see 1], and filed his brief on March 22, 2018, [see 9].

The parties filed a separate notice of appeal from the confirmation order, and that related appeal has been stayed pending the resolution of this one. Even if the original dismissal order was not final for purposes of appeal, a premature notice of appeal takes effect when the final judgment is entered. See Fed. R. Bankr.

The Bankruptcy Court's Order and Memorandum Opinion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   No party has questioned the Bankruptcy Court's determination that Debtor's educational debt is noncontingent. Therefore, the parties do not dispute that all $591,223 of the unsecured debt listed on Debtor's Schedule E/F is noncontingent and liquidated, including Debtor's educational debt subject to an IBR plan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The only issue on appeal relates to whether the Bankruptcy Court abused its discretion in concluding that the existence of educational debt in excess of \u00a7 109(e)'s limit is not cause for dismissal or conversion under \u00a7 1307(c). Because there are no factual or evidentiary issues associated with this decision, whether the Bankruptcy Court abused its discretion turns on the Court's legal determination that Debtor could proceed under Chapter 13 despite the amount of his unsecured debt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The Trustee argues that the Bankruptcy Court abused its discretion in denying its motion to dismiss on that basis. According to the Trustee, if a debtor exceeds \u00a7 109(e)'s unsecured debt limit, he cannot proceed under Chapter 13-regardless of the substantive nature of the debt-and his case must be dismissed or converted to another chapter under \u00a7 1307(c). [9, at 6-7.] The United States Trustee, as\n   <em>\n    amicus curiae\n   </em>\n   , agrees that a debtor who cannot satisfy \u00a7 109(e) cannot seek relief under Chapter 13. [10, at 6-8.] Debtor argues that the Bankruptcy Court's order should be affirmed, as the Bankruptcy Court has discretion to carve out an exception to \u00a7 109(e)'s debt limits for those debtors who exceed those limits solely due to educational debt. [12, at 5-7.] Therefore, according to Debtor, the Bankruptcy Court did not abuse its discretion by doing so in his case.

The Bankruptcy Court first looked to the text of \u00a7 1307(c) and noted that, while \"cause\" is not defined in the statute, courts agree that ineligibility based on exceeding the statutory debt limit is usually cause for either dismissal or conversion. See N.D. Ill. Bankr.

Cal. 1989) ). The Bankruptcy Court next concluded that neither \u00a7 1307(c) nor \u00a7 109(e) expressly required dismissal of a case where educational debt alone causes a debtor to exceed \u00a7 109(e)'s unsecured debt limit. The Court thus turned to the legislative history of \u00a7 109(e)'s debt limits, along with the practical realities of Debtor's situation, in order to reach its decision that no cause exists to dismiss or convert Debtor's Chapter 13 case.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6500280\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/99/995/#p995\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The Court respectfully disagrees with the Bankruptcy Court's conclusion that \u00a7 109(e) and \u00a7 1307(c) are ambiguous. To the contrary, the text of \u00a7 109(e)'s eligibility requirement plainly bars Debtor from proceeding under Chapter 13, and under \u00a7 1307(c) his case must either be dismissed or converted. Because the Bankruptcy Court's decision is premised on the incorrect legal principle that Debtor may proceed under Chapter 13 despite his ineligibility, the Bankruptcy Court abused its discretion in denying the Trustee's motion to dismiss.

Although the decisions of these courts are not binding, the Court is persuaded that their approach to \u00a7 109(e) comports with the text of the statute and the Seventh Circuit cases cited above; a debtor whose debt exceeds the unsecured or secured debt limit cannot proceed under Chapter 13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   The Bankruptcy Court here took a different approach because it concluded that \"Congress simply could not have intended to exclude otherwise eligible individuals from being chapter 13 debtors solely because of educational debt that exceeds the limit.\" N.D. Ill. Bankr. Case No. 17-11668, Docket Entry 38, at 10. Specifically, the Bankruptcy Court noted that Congress enacted the debt limits in \u00a7 109(e)\"in order to prevent sole proprietors with large businesses from abusing creditors by avoiding chapter 11.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6526632\" index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/10/118/#p120\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 9 (citing Report of the Committee on the Judiciary). The Bankruptcy Court reasoned that individuals with large amounts of educational debt are not the types of debtors Congress intended to exclude from Chapter 13, since creditor protection concerns do not apply to such individuals in the same way that they\n   would with sole proprietors of large businesses.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6526632\" index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/10/118/#p120\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   The Bankruptcy Court also reasoned that Congress treats educational debt differently in other contexts within the Bankruptcy Code: such debt is generally nondischargeable, for example, and some courts hold that a Chapter 13 plan can classify such debt separately from other general unsecured debt in some circumstances. N.D. Ill. Bankr. Case No. 17-11668, Docket Entry 38, at 11. The Bankruptcy Court further noted that the Chapter 13 debt limits have only increased gradually since they were enacted, while at the same time educational costs and debts in the United States have skyrocketed. This \"creates an absurd situation\" in which \"an individual with modest income and an immense amount of educational debt is best suited for chapter 13 bankruptcy but exceeds the \u00a7 109(e) unsecured debt limit.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11-12. The Trustee argues that because the statute is clear, these considerations regarding educational debt are irrelevant and should not affect Debtor's eligibility. [9, at 9-13.] Debtor, however, argues that courts routinely carve out exceptions to statutes, as the Bankruptcy Court did here, and therefore consideration of these issues was an appropriate use of discretion. [12, at 15-17.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   The Court is not unsympathetic to the policy concerns raised by the Bankruptcy Court and highlighted by Debtor in his opposition brief regarding individuals with large amounts of educational debt, but the power to create such an exception to \u00a7 109(e) lies with Congress rather than the courts.

In this case, however, the Trustee filed his motion to dismiss Debtor's case for ineligibility within a week of the petition date and well before confirmation. See N.D. Ill. Bankr. Case No. 17-11668, Docket Entry 17. Therefore, there is no res judicata problem in assessing the Trustee's motion to dismiss Debtor's Chapter 13 case. Moreover, the fact that the eligibility requirements of \u00a7 109(e) may be subject to preclusion arguments does not mean that courts \"can or should, as a matter of substantive bankruptcy law, ignore the plain terms of section 109(e).\"\n   <em>\n    Bailey-Pfeiffer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"128\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%201896307\">\n    2018 WL 1896307\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2. As discussed above, the plain language of \u00a7 109(e)'s eligibility limits forecloses any effort to distinguish certain types of noncontingent, liquidated, unsecured debts from others in determining whether Debtor may file under Chapter 13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Debtor argues that the Bankruptcy Court did not abuse its discretion in declining to find cause to dismiss his Chapter 13 petition under \u00a7 1307(c) because the decision to convert or dismiss must be made in \"the best interests of the creditors and the estate,\" and the Bankruptcy Court would have abused its discretion if it did not engage in this analysis. [12, at 9-12.] While \u00a7 1307(c) does provide for discretion on the part of the bankruptcy court in deciding whether to dismiss or convert a Chapter 13 case for cause, the exercise of this discretion cannot contravene the plain language of a statute. Under \u00a7 109(e)'s plain terms, Debtor is ineligible for Chapter 13 relief. This comports with the Seventh Circuit's holdings in\n   <em>\n    Knight\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Day\n   </em>\n   that a debtor who exceeds \u00a7 109(e)'s debt limit \"cannot obtain relief under Chapter 13\" separate and apart from any discussion of \u00a7 1307(c).\n   <em>\n    Day\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"644235,6561047\" index=\"129\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/747/405/\">\n    747 F.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   407 ; see also\n   <em>\n    Cannon\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4310120\" index=\"130\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/521/686/\">\n    521 B.R. at 692\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Congress intended to limit the availability of Chapter 13.

M.D. Fla. 2011) (\" Section 109(e) plainly indicates a congressional intent to limit those eligible for the benefits of Chapter 13.\"). Therefore, the Bankruptcy Court has discretion under \u00a7 1307(c) to convert Debtor's case to Chapter 7 or Chapter 11, rather than dismissing it, if doing so is in the estate's and creditors' best interests. But the Bankruptcy Court does not have discretion to ignore Debtor's ineligibility for relief under \u00a7 109(e)'s plain terms and allow him to proceed with his Chapter 13 case based on a finding that doing so is in the best interests of the estate and creditors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   In sum, the Court concludes that the Bankruptcy Court abused its discretion in denying the Trustee's motion to dismiss. Under the plain language of \u00a7 109(e), Debtor is ineligible to proceed under Chapter 13, and Debtor's ineligibility provides \"cause\" to dismiss or convert the case under \u00a7 1307(c). The Trustee argues that, because the only option before this Court is its motion to dismiss, the Court must not only reverse the Bankruptcy Court's order but must also dismiss Debtor's case. [See 9, at 14.] However, under \u00a7 1307(c), the Bankruptcy Court may either convert the case or dismiss it, \"whichever is in the best interests of creditors and the estate.\" The Bankruptcy Court felt that the best interests of the creditors and the estate would be best served by keeping Debtor in Chapter 13, but this result is foreclosed by Debtor's inability to satisfy the eligibility requirements in \u00a7 109(e). If conversion to another chapter (one other than Chapter 13) would better serve these interests, the Bankruptcy Court has the discretion to convert the case rather than dismiss it despite the Trustee's request for dismissal. The Bankruptcy Court's order denying the Trustee's motion to dismiss is reversed, and the case is remanded to the Bankruptcy Court to make this determination after taking into account the views of the parties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.
