In the case in judgment the gift was to the \u201cTrustees of the Presbyterian Home for Old Ladies, situated in Richmond, Va.\u201d There was no such institution, but the evidence clearly shows that the \u201cRichmond Home \u2022 for Ladies,\u201d a corporation in the city of Richmond, chartered for the purpose of providing a home and gratuitous support for indigent and infirm women, and especially those connected with the Methodist Church, South, and the Presbyterian Church, was the object of the testator\u2019s bounty, and it will be permitted to. take.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b750-12\">2. <em>Wills\u2014Richmond Home for Ladies\u2014Circuit Court Charter\u2014Powers. </em>The \u201cRichmond Home for Ladies\u201d is a benevolent business corporation, incorporated in 1883 by the Circuit Court of the city of Richmond, and its charter confers upon it ample power to administer the trust imposed upon it by the will in controversy. At that time the Legislature had power to create such a corporation, or to delegate its authority .to the courts, and it did so delegate it by Acts 1866-\u201967, chapter 129, carried into the Code of 1887 as section 1145. A prior act authorized the chartering of \u201corphan asylums,\u201d \u201chospitals,\u201d and the like, and the later act was intended to be even m&lt;jre comprehensive, and was not restricted to strictly business corporations. Franchises granted thus indirectly by the state are the same in effect as if granted directly by the Legislature.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b750-15\">3. <em>W\u2019ills-\u2014Construction\u2014Life Estate After a Life Estate\u2014Qift </em>Over\u2014 <em>Death of Second Life Tenant During Life of </em>First.-\u2014-Where specific legacies are given to A and B for life, with remainder in each case to C for life (he being the residuary legatee of the whole estate for life), and after the death of C the whole estate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>is given absolutely to X, if a dies in the lifetime of A and B, lthe whole state passes at once to X, subject to the life estajes in favor of A and B.

That there -were no such persons as the \u2018Trustees of the Presbyterian Home for Old Ladies, situated in Richmond, Va./ but that the testatrix by that description meant the \u2018Richmond Home for Ladies/ which is a corporation chartered by the Circuit Court of the city of Richmond.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b753-8\">\u201c2. That the \u2018Richmond Home for. Ladies\u2019 is capable of taking the bequest made in the will, and that the bequest to it is legal and valid.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b753-9\">\u201c3. That there was no intestacy resulting from the death of J. C.

That the bequest of fifty dollars a year, perpetually, to the trustee of Cedar Hill Cemetery for the general improvement of the cemetery is valid. But that there is an intestacy as to the bequest of $150, to be expended annually to keep testatrix\u2019s section in the cemetery in good order and repair; and that \u2018the $150 <em>per annum, </em>being a portion of the residuum of the testatrix\u2019s estate\u2019 would go to her next of kin.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b753-11\">By the decree under review the Chancery Court overruled exceptions of the appellants to the report of the master on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>first, second and third findings and sustained the exception of the.Richmond Home for Ladies to. so much of the, fourth finding as declares . that' the bequest ,qf,.,$f50 <em>per annum,, </em>in perpetuity, goes to testatrix\u2019s next, of kin. The-court was of opinion that the bequest was invalid and void; but, with the exception- of the accumulation therefrom prior to the death of J. C, Petty (as to which no' decision was made), that the .income after his death passed to the Richmond Home for Ladies as residuary legatee..</p>\n<p id=\"b754-5\">The appellants assign as error the rulings of the court in the-particulars indicated. \u25a0 ' .</p>\n<p id=\"b754-6\">Upon the first assignment we have, no difiiculty in agreeing with, the Chancery Court that the bequest, \u201cto the trustees of the Presbyterian Home, for Old Ladies, situated in Richmond, Va., was intended by the testatrix to be made to the defendant, the \u2018Richmond Home for Ladies,\u2019,, an institution incorporated in due form, of law by an order.. of the Circuit Court of the-city- of\u25a0 Richmond, entered on the 28th day of February, 1883.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b754-7\">The well-established. rule that-parol evidence is admissible- to identify the object of a testator\u2019s bounty is succinctly stated in the case of Roy v. Rowzie, 25 Gratt. 604, 605, as follows: \u201cParol evidence, is- always; admissible .and even necessary to lead, us to the.-person or object and.Subject referred to in a bequestf Phei.court of.-construction, with.,the testator\u2019s will, in hand, looks' fof the object of his bounty and.-the thing intended to be -given,&lt;: and expects them to answer precisely the terms of description-given: .of them in- the will. Generally they do, and there is no difficulty! Often they do 'not; and sometimes there .are two; or more objects or subjects which answer precisely or equally, thp, description'contained -in the will. In .such cases resort must) be had to\u2019parol- evidence and. -the surrounding circumstances to show; what the testator intended :by the - expressions which he: used; and, almost always,'his intention is-.-tfius ascertained with; sufficient, if-not'unerring,\u2019 certainty. If it cannot be, the bequest mustivthen fail of- .effieqty.b.nt the court.-is always-reluctant so to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>declare.. It.-will, not require that .the object or subject shall have every ear-mark given to it by the testator. Hay, it may in some respect have'different ear-marks,, and yet the descrip-, tion contained in .the bequest, may be sufficient to give it effect. \u25a0 <em>Falso demonsiratio .non nocei cum de corpor.e constat </em>is a maxim which expresses a rule of construction to which the court. has frequent recourse in such cases.\u201d .</p>\n<p id=\"b755-4\">So also the Court of Appeals of New York declared, in the, ease of Lefevre v. Lefevre, 59 N. Y. 440, 442: <em>\u201cA </em>corporation may-be designated by its corporate name, by the name by which it:is usually or popularly called and known, by a name by which; it-was known and called by-the testator, or by any other name' or description by which it can be distinguished from every other corporation; and when any but the corporate name is used the. circumstances .to enable the court to apply the name or description to a particular corporation and identify it as-the body.intended,- and-, to distinguish it from all others and bring it within'the term^.-.of the will, may, in all;cases, be-proved- by parol.\u201d \" . \u2022 \u25a0 -.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-5\">\u25a0 \u00a1Tested.by- these \u25a0 recognized .canons in the- interpretation of-' \"wills the evidence and surrounding circumstances show-beyond a reasonable doubt'that the \u25a0 Richmond \u25a0 Home for Radies was-intended-as.the ehief object of'testatrix\u2019s bounty. It appears that her' only relatives were: collateral kindred, most of* whom -were strangers to her; and, by'fair implication from-the-Ian-; guage of\u2022 the will, her relations' with such .of them as were' known to' her were not cordial, for she assigns as a reason for' excluding them from participation-in her' estate,' that\u2022 she had' left her property to those who were kind to her \"in her bereave-, nient. It also appears that she was m devoted Presbyterian; and her disposition to\" make a home in the-city \u25a0 of Richmond for' ladies of that- coUmiunion the chief- .object of her bounty is' placed beyond question by the testimony of an intelligent law' yer -whom she consulted' three .years after -the- date of the will: in controversy, with the view, of having him.-redraft'her will-; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>so as to make certain changes in'the original instrument. Accordingly, in the draft of a will prepared by him at her request, a clause was incorporated carrying out that intention, and a blank space was left for the insertion of the corporate name of the institution\u2014a precaution rendered necessary by the fact that Mrs. McClung was not certain about the name, and was advised of the importance of accuracy in that regard. The draft of the new will was written in the summer of 1896, but Mrs. McClung died the following spring without having executed it. It thus appears that three years after the date of .the original will and within less than a year before her death the testatrix manifested an abiding purpose to make the previously designated beneficiary her residuary legatee. The evidence is equally clear that the Richmond Home for Ladies is the only institution in the city of Richmond where Presbyterian ladies are cared for.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-5\">The force of the argument, that testatrix could not have intended that institution as the object of her solicitude and bounty because Methodist ladies are likewise within the provisions of the charter and cared for by the Richmond Home for Ladies, is impaired by the facts that the language of the will in that particular is not exclusive, and it is not shown that the testatrix was not apprised of the scope of the charity. Hor can that circumstance be controlling on the question of identification, when it distinctly appears that the institution, in addition to providing a home for Methodist ladies, also furnishes a home (indeed, the only home in the city of Richmond) where Presbyterian ladies, the express objects, of testatrix\u2019s benefaction, are cared for.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-6\">In the case of <em>McDonough </em>v. Murdock, 15 Howard 564, 14 L. Ed. 732, a legacy -was given to the city of Baltimore to be dedicated to a special use, yet the court (at page 728 of 15 \u2019 How. 14, L. Ed. 732), said:. \u201cHor can we perceive why'the designation of the particular use, if within the general objects of the corporation, can affect the result.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b757-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number>In the case of <em>Roy </em>v. <em>Rowzie, supra, </em>the bequest was to the \u201cBaptist Theological Seminary.\u201d It was shown that there was a chartered institution under the name of the \u201cSouthern Baptist Theological Seminary,\u201d which was the only Baptist Theological Seminary in South Carolina, and the bequest was sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-5\">So, in <em>Trustees </em>v. <em>Guthrie, </em>86 Va. 125, 10 S. E. 318, 6 L. R. A. 321, a bequest to the Secretary of the Board of Foreign Missions of the Presbyterian Church in the United States, and known as the Southern Presbyterian Church, was held to be sufficiently identified by proof of the fact that there was a chartered institution in Forth Carolina under the name of the Trustees of the General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church in the United States, with power to receive and administer such funds as were contributed by the Church for foreign and domestic missions, and the education of ministers and the support of aged and infirm ministers.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-6\">Having reached the conclusion that the Richmond Home for Ladies has been identified as the object of the testatrix\u2019s charity we are next confronted with the question of the capacity in law of that corporation to take the bequest.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-7\">The learned commissioner<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> has submitted with his report a valuable and instructive historical narrative of the constitutional provisions and legislative\" enactments on the subjects of \u201cReligion,\u201d \u201cChurches,\u201d \u201cCharities\u201d and \u201cSchools,\u201d together with a discriminating discussion of decisions of this court in point, from the foundation of the Commonwealth to the present time.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-8\">His review includes, among others, the leading cases of <em>Gallego\u2019s Ex\u2019ors </em>v. <em>Attorney-General, </em>3 Leigh 487 (decided in 1832), where it was held that a bequest to the Roman Catholic congregation at Richmond was void for uncertainty; <em>Protestant Episcopal Education Society of Virginia </em>v. <em>Churchman\u2019s Representatives, </em>80 Va. 718 (decided in 1885), sustaining a bequest <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>to the trustees of the \u201cProtestant Episcopal Society of Virginia,\" incorporated, to be used exclusively for educating poor young men for the Episcopal' ministry; <em>Trustees, etc., </em>v. <em>Guthrie, </em>86 Va. 125,10 S. E. 318, 6 L. R. A. 321 (decided in 1889;), upholding a bequest\u2019to \u201cthe Secretary of 'the Board of Foreign Missions of the presbyterian Church in the United \"States\"; and, lastly, <em>Fifield </em>v. <em>Van Wyck, </em>94 <em>Va. </em>557, 27 S.E. 446,. 64 Am. St. Rep. 745 (decided in 1897), holding a devise \u201cto two 'trustees, or to the survivor of them . in trust for\u2018the benefit of the New Jerusalem Church\u201d (Swedenborgian), the vague and indefinite to be enforced by a court of equity. In 'the latter case the court disapproves the <em>dicta </em>in the <em>Churchman case </em>and in <em>Trustee </em>v. <em>Guthrie, supra, </em>adverse to the decision in <em>Gallego </em>v. <em>Attorney-General, </em>and recognizes and reiterates the 'principles Of that c\u00e1se \u00e1nd the cases which have followed it on the subject of indefinite charities.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-13\">We shall confin\u00e9' .our observations to a discussion of the concrete question presented by- the record, premising only that, in our view of the subject, the purposes for which the Richmond Home for Ladies was incorporated do not bear such relation tb /any church or religious sect or denomination as to contravene either the letter or spirit of sections 14 and 17 of. Article V of the Virginia Constitution of\u2019 1869. It is a benevolent business corporation, with a capital stock of not less than $10,000 nor more than $200,000, chartered for the purpose of \u201cestablishing and maintaining in the city of Richmond an institution in which indigent and infirm women of respectable character, especially such as are connected with the Methodist Episcopal Church, South, and the Presbyterian Church of the United States, of the said city, may he provided with a comfortable home and support gratuitously, or on such charges as maybe prescribed. But aged and infirm women not connected, with either of those churches, or with any other church, may he admitted. . . . The chief business to he transacted is the providing and maintaining of a home for such women as may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number>be admitted into thfe' institution.\u201d- ' -Thfe' charter 'also provides for \u00a1making a constitution and by-laws, the ap'pointnient of \u00e1 board of directors:, with,povVfer to declare- and-fill\u00bb vacancies in their board, and also'to-appoint managers'-and-other-officers.- \u2022 In this connection counsel-for the app\u00e9llants mak\u00e9-'the'-following concession in their brief': irWe- have never 'denied 'that such powfers \u2022as are claimed for the--\u2019Richmond Home for'Ladies1 could'have 'been granted' in-Virginia by- legislative charter:; :aiid every Virginia case relied upon by'them-is a case of1'a-bequest to a corporation incorporated by an act of the state legislature, which vested the corporation with' power to take and'administer the bequest. Our contention is-that no such powers were ever conferred-by law upon this appellee, and that rio stich authority was ever granted to' thfe courts tb grant' \u00e1 charter' 'conferring 'any such powers.\u201d ,' -</p>\n<p id=\"b759-4\">If It can be maintained that it was within the competency of the Circuit Court of the city of Richmond to grant the charter in question there will be no impediment in the way of sustaining the validity of the gift; for the bequest is in furtherance of the express purposes of the corporation, and ample power is conferred upon it to administer the trust, and the amount of the donation is not in excess of the maximum capital allowed by the chartfer.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-5\">A summary of the legislation on the subject of court charters in Virginia will tend to elucidate the state of the law when the Richmond Home for Ladies was incorporated in 1883. \u25a0 '</p>\n<p id=\"b759-6\">The original statute conferring power upon courts to grant charters of incorporation was passed March 3, 1851, and was limited to charters for mining and manufacturing purposes. On March 11, 1856, the act was so amended as to permit'\u201cfive or more persons, who shall be desirous to form a company for the purpose of mining and manufacturing, the establishment of a hotel, cemetery, gas-light, water, springs and telegraph companies, orphan asylums, hospitals, academies, libraries, literary and building associations,\u201d to apply to the Circuit Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>of the county in which the operations of the company are proposed to he conducted for a charter. By Acts of 1866-\u201967, chapter 129, the statute was again amended, discontinuing the enumeration of subjects, but still further enlarging the power of the courts, by permitting them to grant charters \u201cfor the conduct of any enterprize or business which might be lawfully conducted by an individual or by a body politic or corporate, except to construct a turnpike to be constructed beyond the limits of the county, or a railroad or canal, or to establish a bank of circulation.\u201d As indicative of the legislative policy with respect to such charters we quote from the same enactment: \u201cAnd it shall not be lawful for the General Assembly to grant relief, or to incorporate any company, or to alter or amend the charter of any corporation, provision for which is made in this section, unless application shall first have been made to such . . . court, or to the judge thereof in vacation, and refused.\u201d See <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Crighton, </em>33 Gratt. 696; where the legislation: on this subject is traced and its validity upheld.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-7\">As observed the act of March 11, 1856, authorized the courts to grant charters to orphan ayslums and other specified eleemosynary institutions; and, as we have seen, in 1883, when the Richmond Home for Ladies was incorporated, the scope of the enactment had been so enlarged by amendment as to include all enterprises or businesses which might be lawfully conducted by an individual or by a body politic or corporate, with the four exceptions mentioned in the statute. This enactment was carried into section 1145 of the Code of 1887, and that it is sufficiently comprehensive to embrace the Richmond Home for Ladies is conclusively shown by section 1148 of the same chapter of the Code, which declares that \u201cThe minimum capital of every such company (except a cemetery company, or a company whose object is purely benevolent, which may have only a nominal capital) shall not be less than $500.\u201d But the Richmond Home for Ladies is not only a benevolent institution, but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>a business enterprise also, as will clearly appear from an inspection of the charter.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-5\">We shall notice briefly the remaining contention in this regard, namely, the denial of the power of the Legislature to confer upon courts authority to grant such charters.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-6\">In the recent case of <em>Button </em>v. <em>State Corporation Commission of </em>Virginia, 105 Va. 634, 54 S. E. 769, this court in discussing the power of the legislative department, observes: \u201cIn a government, such as ours, of reserved powers, it is said the legislative department acknowledges no superiors except the Federal and state constitutions, and its authority to enact laws, unless forbidden by one or the other of those instruments in express terms or by necessary implication, is paramount.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b761-7\">\u201cFranchises granted indirectly by the state through instrumentalities provided by general laws are the same in effect as if the power conferring the same had been exercised directly by the state itself.\u201d <em>Mason </em>v. <em>Harper\u2019s Ferry </em>Bridge; 17 W. Va. 396. See also <em>Henrico County </em>v. <em>City of Richmond, </em>ante, p. 282, 55 S. E. <em>682; </em>1 Thompson on Corp., sections 36, 110.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-8\">Our conclusions that the Richmond Home for Ladies has been identified as the residuary legatee under Mrs. McOlung\u2019s will, and that its charter of incorporation is valid, constitute a decisive answer to the next assignment of error, that the bequest is too indefinite to be enforced by a court of equity.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-9\">The cases of <em>Churchman </em>v. <em>Churchman\u2019s Representatives, </em>and <em>Trustees </em>v. <em>Guthrie, supra, </em>fully sustain that proposition. The criticism of those cases in <em>Fifield </em>v. <em>Van Wyck </em>is, not that they were not rightly decided, but that the opinions contain <em>dicta </em>contrary to the decisions in <em>Gallego\u2019s Ex\u2019ors </em>v. <em>Attorney-General, </em>and other Virginia cases. The court in referring to those decisions observes: \u201cThe records in each case show, in the opinion of the court, that the bequest was to a corporation and for purposes within the scope of its corporate powers and duties, and distinctly defined.\u201d In <em>Fifield </em>v. <em>Van Wyck </em>the court held that the evidence was insufficient to connect the-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>corporation known as the \u201cGeneral Convention of the Hew Jerusalem in the United States of America\u201d with the object named in the testator\u2019s will, and that the devise was, therefore, void for vagueness and uncertainty.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-5\">In <em>Roy </em>v. Rowzie, <em>supra, </em>Judge Moncure, at page 611, says: \u201cA bequest to'a corporation, for general purpose of its incorporation, is not indefinite or uncertain in any respect.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b762-6\">Numerous authorities sustaining similar bequests are assembled and reviewed by Judge Burks in his able brief in the <em>Churchman </em>Case, 80 Va. 720.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-7\">We shall next consider the question of alleged partial intestacy with respect to the income from the trust estate resulting from the death of J. C. Petty previous to that of Georgia Kenney and Margaret Davis.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-8\">While that was a contingency which the testatrix did not anticipate, or, at least, did not provide against, it constitutes only a minor incident in the general testamentary plan, and cannot be allowed to thwart the more important design of the testatrix in the disposition of her estate. The prior death of Petty does not affect in any manner the provision made for Georgia Kenney and Margaret Davis; each will receive the annuity given her until marriage or death, and that was what the testatrix wished to effect. As the commissioner justly observes: \u201cTo interpret the will so as to make the remainder to the \u2018Home\u2019 not to vest in possession till the death of Georgia Kenney and Margaret Davis, or the survivor of them . would be to put a construction upon it that would certainly not carry into effect any meaning that she had in making it. . . . Petty was the life-tenant of the total residuum, which, and in addition the two annuities to Georgia Kenney and Margaret Davis, is given to the Home.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b762-10\">In 2 Lomax on Ex\u2019ors, page 12, section 10, it is said: \u201cWhere there are words in a will which have no meaning, or which are contrary to the general meaning of the testator, they will be rejected; and, on -the other hand, words omitted by mistake, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>and which are absolutely necessary to effectuate the general intention, will be supplied.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AQB\">\u201cIn order to fulfill the manifest general intention of the testator the court will supply such words as, from the general complexion of the will, compared with the situation of the testator, and of the legatees and objects of his bounty, are absolutely necessary to effectuate the purposes and dispositions intended by him.\u201d Idem, section 13. See also Schouler on Wills, section 477.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-6\">In <em>Meade </em>v. <em>Collidge, </em>179 N. Y. 386, 72 N. E. 314, a,case very similar in its facts to this, the court held: \u201cWhen death \u2022of <em>cestui que trust </em>(son) before that of beneficiaries of other trusts (brother and sister), the principal of which was directed to be added upon their (brother and sister) death to his (son), fund does not result in failure to dispose of it although the testator did not expressly provide for such a contingency.\u201d The court said: \u201cIt is true, of course, that the particular event which has happened is not described in the will, and that we may infer that the testator did not suppose that the son would fail to survive the older lives; but that will not suffice to defeat the evident testamentary scheme.\u201d And again: \u201cThe condition that they (brother\u2019s and sister\u2019s trust fund) should severally be added to the son\u2019s estate became impossible of performance, and as in itself it was not one essential to, but merely suspensive \u2022of, the vesting of the gift, it should be disregarded. If a minor part of the testamentary plan, as I think it to be, it must be subordinated to the effectuation of that plan. We might hold, from the irresistible evidence of the testator\u2019s intention, that there was a gift by implication of the trust estates as they fell in; or, perhaps more correctly, that the direction in the \u2022seventh and ninth clauses was not an essential condition of a right in the next of kin to take, and that the prior death of the son merely accelerated the vesting of the estates in the members of that class.\u201d The next of kin were made residuary \u2022devisees.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>As was said in <em>Wright </em>v. <em>Oldham, </em>8 Leigh 306, \u201cThe will furnishes another among the innumerable instances in which unskilled draughtsmen have used one set of words to provide for many shifting contingencies, and have welded together what ought to have been kept separate and distinct.\u201d See also <em>Hurt </em>v. <em>Brooks, </em>89 Va. 600, 16 S. E. 358; 2 Red. Wills, 116,. section 5; 2 Williams on Ex\u2019or s, 514 (1087) n.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-5\">These authorities sustain the conclusion reached by the commissioner and trial court that Petty\u2019s death anterior to that of Georgia Kenney and Margaret Davis did not result in a partial intestacy.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-6\">We have already incidentally referred to the \u201cHome\u201d named in the will as the residuary legatee, a fact admitted in the answers of appellants, but denied in their petition for appeal. We are of opinion that the language of the will admits of no-other construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-7\">In <em>Prison Asso. </em>v. <em>Russell, </em>103 Va. 567, 49 S. E. 968, the court says: \u201cHo particular form of words is necessary to constitute a residuary legatee; any expression is sufficient from-which the testator\u2019s intention is discernible that the person designated shall take the surplus. Hor is it of controlling consequence that the clause is not the last of the disposing provisions, though such is the usual position. Woerner\u2019s American Law of Administration (2d Ed.), section 462.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-9\">\u201cThe residue is that part of a testator\u2019s estate not otherwise-disposed of, hence a general residuary bequest carries with it everything not in terms disposed of, and with such exceptions as are pointed out in connection with the subject of lapsed and void legacies, everything not effectually or well disposed of, as well as lapsed legacies, unless a contrary intent clearly appear from the will. <em>Idem.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b764-10\">\u201cSuch words as \u2018rest,\u2019 residue,\u2019 \u2018remainder,\u2019 are not indispensable to a residuary bequest of personal estate; but in various instances words and expressions quite informal have beem <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number>given this effect, ont of regard to the testator\u2019s obvious intention. Schouler on Wills (8d Ed.), section 522.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b765-5\">It follows from these views that the Chancery Court did not err in sustaining the exception taken by the Richmond Home for Ladies to so much of the finding of the commissioner as holds that after the death of J. C. Petty the bequest of $150 <em>per annum </em>in perpetuity should go to the heirs at law and next of kin of the testatrix.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-6\">It was stated at bar that in the event this court should affirm the decree of the Chancery Court in that particular a satisfactory composition of the respective claims of the trustees of the cemetery and the Richmond Home for Ladies to the fund in \u25a0dispute would he made. Further consideration of that phase of the case is, therefore, unnecessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-7\">For these reasons the decree of .the Chancery Court is affirmed. .</p>\n<p id=\"b765-8\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b757-9\">Mr. Jackson Guy.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
