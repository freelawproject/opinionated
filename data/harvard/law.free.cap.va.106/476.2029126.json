We do not think that this additional allegation in the plea alters the case or differentiates it from the case just disposed of; and for the reasons given in the opinion referred to the judgment complained of in this case must be reversed, the verdict of the jury set aside and a new trial granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-4\">\n<em>Reversed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
