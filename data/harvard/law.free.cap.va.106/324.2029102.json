In the case at bar the council of the city of Richmond passed such an ordinance, but the charter of the city contains no general welfare clause, the power is not conferred expressly, and it is not covered by the provision of the charter giving the council the control and management of the fiscal and municipal affairs of the city, nor in any other way by implication.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"ACc6\">3.

(Article II, section 31.) Membership of a standing committee of a political party is not prohibited by the section referred to; and, the constitution having dealt with the subject, it is not within the competency of the city, by ordinance, to add other inhibitions to those therein enumerated.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>The governing principle in such case is thus stated: \u201cWhen the constitution defines the qualifications of an office it is not in the power of the Legislature to change or superadd to them, unless the power to do so is expressly, or hy necessary implication, conferred by the Constitution itself.\u201d Cooley on Constitutional Limitations, 79. See also Throop on Public Offices, section 73; <em>Black </em>v. <em>Trower, </em>79 Va. 123; <em>Louthan </em>v. <em>Com\u2019th, </em>79 Va. 196, 52 Am. Rep. 626; <em>Gallalee </em>v. <em>Calvert, </em>1 Va. Dec. 561.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">But there is still another reason why the provision' of -the ordinance under consideration is invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-6\">\u201cIt is,\u201d says Judge Dillon in his work on Municipal Corporations, \u201ca general and undisputed proposition of law that <em>a municipal corporation possesses and can exercise the following powers, </em>and no others: Pirst, those granted in <em>express words; </em>second, those <em>necessarily </em>or <em>fairly implied </em>in or <em>incident </em>to the powers expressly granted; third, those <em>essential </em>to the declared objects and purposes of the corporation, not simply convenient, but indispensable. Any fair, reasonable doubt concerning the existence of power is resolved by the courts against the corporation, and the power is denied.\u201d 1 Dillon on Mun. Corp. (4th Ed.), section 89.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-7\">This admirable exposition of the rule is fully sustained by authority, and is conclusive of the case. The charter of the city will be searched in vain for authority, either express or implied, to ingraft such a limitation on municipal offices. It contains no general welfare clause, in common acceptation of that term; and the restrictive language of section 19, invoked as warrant for the enactment, is wholly inadequate for that purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-8\">The remaining assignment of: error that the validity of the ordinance cannot be drawn in question by motion to quash the summons is answered by the case of <em>Adkins </em>v. <em>City of Richmond, </em>98 Va. 91, 34 S. E. 967, 47 L. R. A. 583, 81 Am. St. Rep. 705.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-9\">The judgment of the Hustings Court is plainly right, and must be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"AlL\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
