BROWN, Chief Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b1280-5\">Schnaiderman was convicted of making a false statement to a government official in violation of 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1001<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (Count I) and of willfully failing to file a report that he was transporting into the United States more than $5,000 required by the Bank Secrecy Act, 31 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1101<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>, and 31 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 103.23(a), 103.25(b), in violation of 31 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1058<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> (Count II). For the reasons discussed below, we reverse the conviction on both counts and remand with instructions to enter a judgment of acquittal.</p>\n<p id=\"A4J\">Schnaiderman, a Venezuelan resident, arrived at Miami International Airport from Caracas and entered the customs line. When he attempted to present his customs declaration form (Form 6059-B), Customs Inspector Randall told Schnaiderman that he had to claim all his luggage prior to entering the inspection line. Also noticing that Schnaiderman had neither signed nor completed the customs declaration, Randall informed him that it would be necessary to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b1280-7\">When Schnaiderman reappeared in the line, Randall inquired in Spanish if he was carrying more than $5,000. Schnaiderman replied, \u201cNo.\u201d On completed Form 6059-B which Schnaiderman gave to Randall, \u201cNo\u201d was checked in answer to the question (in Spanish) whether he was carrying over $5,000 in cash or negotiable instruments.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> After questioning the traveler about a ring in his possession, Randall passed him on to Customs Officer Deely for a second examination. Deely, observing Schnaiderman\u2019s bulging pockets and nervousness, asked that he empty his pockets. The bulge comprised $8,086. At some point Deely asked Schnaiderman if he understood U.S. currency laws. Appellant responded that he was aware of those laws but that he was not going to spend the money in the United States. He was going to Aruba in two days to gamble.</p>\n<p id=\"b1280-16\">Schnaiderman asserts that there is insufficient evidence as a matter of law to prove an intentional violation of 31 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 1101 and 1058. He also urges that his negative response to Randall\u2019s question falls within the \u201cexculpatory \u2018no\u2019 \u201d exception to 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1001. Since we agree with these contentions, we do not reach the other issues raised on this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1280-17\">\n<em>Count II</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1280-18\"><em>United States v. Granda, </em>5 Cir., 1978, 565 F.2d 922 [1978] is dispositive of Schnaiderman\u2019s appeal from the 31 U.S. C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 1101, 1058 conviction. The facts in <em>Granda </em>are strikingly similar to those be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1211\">*1211</page-number>fore us now. Mrs. Granda\u2019s customs declaration Form 6059-B contained a \u201cNo\u201d answer to the question whether she was carrying over $5,000. Examination of her purse revealed a total of $10,000. She claimed to be unaware of the reporting requirements of 31 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1101.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1281-5\">This Court, following the lead of the Second Circuit,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> held that since 31 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1101 requires \u201cknowing\u201d transportation and since \u00a7 1058<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> requires a \u201cwillful\u201d violation, there must be proof of the defendant\u2019s knowledge of the reporting requirement and his specific intent to commit the crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b1281-6\">There were two bases for reversal. First, the trial court failed properly to instruct the jury on specific intent and such failure was held to be plainly erroneous.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Second, as a matter of law, it was impossible to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Mrs. Granda acted with knowledge of the reporting requirements. Responding to the government\u2019s argument, also made in the present case, that the question on Form 6059-B put the traveler on notice that he must file the report of Form 4790, the Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1281-7\">. The failure of the government to make known the requirements of the statute is fatal to their case. The isolated act of bringing money in excess of $5,000 into the country is not illegal or even immoral. What is required is merely a filing of the proper form. Proof of the requisite knowledge and willfulness, therefore, is almost impossible unless affirmative steps are taken by the government to make the laws\u2019 requirements known. The government argues that the defendant was made aware of the reporting requirement by the question on the customs declaration form asking whether the defendant was carrying more than $5,000. We do not agree. The effect, if any, of this question is merely to cause the traveler to think that it is illegal to carry a large amount of money into the country. The question in no way tells the traveler it is perfectly legal to enter or leave the country with more than $5,000 but that a form reporting this fact must be completed. Nor does the untruthful answer of the question by the defendant prove beyond a reasonable doubt that she knew she was supposed to fill out a form. An untruthful answer could very easily be prompted by the question on the form which might cause the traveler who enters the country with more than $5,000 to think that his or her possession is by itself illegal, and who therefore answers untruthfully in order to attempt to avoid being caught breaking the law. We do not accept the government\u2019s contention that the defendant\u2019s falsification of her declaration forms proves that she was aware of the separate reporting requirement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1281-14\"><em>Id. </em>at 926.</p>\n<p id=\"b1281-15\">While Deely stated <em>on </em>direct that Schnaiderman admitted an awareness of U.S. currency laws, testimony elicited on cross indicates that Schnaiderman was not told specifically of the reporting requirements as mandated by <em>Granda :</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1281-16\">Q And when you said he was familiar with the U.S. currency laws, what are the U.S. currency laws?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1282-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1212\">*1212</page-number>A Any person entering or leaving the United States is required to report over $5,000.00 if they are carrying it on themselves.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1282-4\">Q You didn\u2019t ask him that question. You just asked him if he understood the U.S. currency laws; is that right? You didn\u2019t explain to him what the U.S. currency laws were, did you Officer?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1282-5\">A At that particular time, no, I didn\u2019t.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AU3\">Tr. 59-60.</p>\n<p id=\"b1282-6\">As pointed out by Judge Fay in <em>Granda, </em>it would be a simple matter for the government to notify travelers, either by way of modification of customs declaration Form 6059-B, or verbal advice and proffering Form 4790,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> that if they are transporting more than $5,000 they are required to fill out Form 4790. None of these steps was taken to inform Schnaiderman of the reporting requirements and there is no evidence in the record from which the jury could conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that Schnaiderman had willfully failed to file a report knowing that such report was required. An acknowledged awareness of \u201cU.S. currency laws\u201d is too vague and unspecific to satisfy the <em>Granda </em>standards. Therefore, his conviction on this count must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1282-7\">\n<em>Count I</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1282-8\">As to Count I, Schnaiderman contends that his oral denial to Randall falls within the \u201cexculpatory \u2018no\u2019 \u201d exception to 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1001 which was first established in this Circuit in <em>Paternostro v. United States, </em>5 Cir., 1962, 311 F.2d 298. In that case the appellant had given negative answers'to a special agent of the Internal Revenue Service asking, <em>inter alia, </em>whether Paternostro had received graft money. After reviewing the legislative history of \u00a7 1001<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and cases prosecuted under that statute, the Court held that \u00a7 1001 did not cover negative exculpatory responses to questions propounded by an investigating agent<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> during a conference not initiated by the interviewee. <em>Id. </em>at 305.</p>\n<p id=\"b1282-12\">This interpretation of \u00a7 1001\u2019s scope was based on a consideration of the evils this statute was designed to eliminate.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Paternostro had made no statement relating to any claim on his behalf against the United States or an agency thereof. He was not seeking to obtain or retain any official position or employment in any agency or department of the government. Rather, he was sought out by a government investigative agent to determine what Paternostro knew or had done with respect to a system of organized graft in the police department. Finally, he did not aggressively and deliberately initiate any positive or affirmative statement calculated to pervert the legitimate functions of government. <em>Id. </em>This last factor has been critical in the Fifth Circuit cases since <em>Paternostro </em>in which the \u201cexculpatory \u2018no\u2019 \u201d exception has been asserted. See <em>United States v. Bush, </em>1974, 503 F.2d 813, 818 (\u201cexculpatory \u2018no\u2019 \u201d exception applicable); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>5 Cir., 1976, 530 F.2d 52, 55 (\u201cexculpatory \u2018no\u2019 \u201d exception inapplicable). <em>Cf. United States v. Lambert, </em>5 Cir., 1974, 501 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1213\">*1213</page-number>F.2d 943, 946 (en banc) (\u00a7 1001 applicable to false statement which prompted FBI to conduct investigation); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Krause, </em>5 Cir., 1975, 507 F.2d 113, 118 (\u00a7 1001 applicable to false statements made during NLRB hearing where record showed aggressive action by defendant to impair functions of NLRB).</p>\n<p id=\"b1283-5\">We have concluded that 18 U.S. C.A. \u00a7 1001 was not intended to cover Schnaiderman\u2019s negative oral answer to Agent Randall and that the \u201cexculpatory \u2018no\u2019 \u201d exception applies under the circumstances of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1283-6\">First, Schnaiderman was not making a claim against the United States, nor was he seeking employment with the government. More important, there is simply no evidence that Schnaiderman \u201caggressively and deliberately initiate[d] any positive or affirmative statement calculated to pervert the legitimate functions of government.\u201d <em>Paternostro, </em>311 F.2d at 305. As to this prong of the <em>Paternostro </em>test, the government contends that Schnaiderman was the initiator because he sought permission to enter the United States. We disagree. Agent Randall clearly initiated the questioning. Schnaiderman did not walk up to Agent Randall and volunteer the statement, \u201cI am not transporting more than $5,000\u201d in order to prevent the agent from doing his duty. \u201cPerversion of a governmental body\u2019s function is the hallmark of a \u00a7 1001 offense.\u201d <em>Lambert, supra, </em>501 F.2d at 946. The \u201cfunction\u201d of the customs agents at issue here is to ensure that the transportation of more than $5,000 into the United States is reported. We cannot say Schnaiderman attempted to pervert something he may not even have known about and as to which we now have twice held, he was entitled to affirmative advice that such a report was required.</p>\n<p id=\"b1283-8\">Our conclusion also fits the mold of possible self-incrimination at least in the minds of travelers who probably think it is illegal to bring more than $5,000 in currency into this country. See <em>Granda, </em>565 F.2d at 926 quoted <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1283-9\">The relationship between Counts I and II is critical here. We have previously held that there is insufficient evidence as a matter of law to establish beyond a reasonable doubt that Schnaiderman willfully violated 31 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 1101 and 1058 because the government took no steps to bring the reporting requirements to his attention and there is no indication that he actually knew of the reporting requirements. We agree with Judge Dooling that \u00a7 1001 \u201cmust in each instance of its application derive the substance of its prohibition from the circumstances in which the statement is used. The statute here underlying \u00a7 1001, 31 U.S.C. 1101(b), is not one concerned with oral statements to investigators, but with written reports on the international transportation of monetary instruments.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Gomez Londono, </em>S.D.N.Y., 1976, 422 F.Supp. 519, 525, <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>2 Cir., 1977, 553 F.2d 805.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> For Schnaiderman\u2019s statement to have come within the scope of \u00a7 1001 as defined in <em>Lambert, </em>the <em>government </em>would have to demonstrate a knowing and willful intent to pervert the purpose of the Bank Secrecy Act. On the record before us, there is simply no evidence that he had such an intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b1283-10\">Here customs officials asked Schnaiderman a question without informing him of the. simple consequences of an affirmative answer. They did not tell him that it was legal to bring more than $5,000 into the country so long as he filled out Form 4790. Thus, Schnaiderman stands convicted by his own word in a situation where the governmental function with which Congress was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1214\">*1214</page-number>concerned was the filing of a proper, obviously written report. As Judge Fay pointed out in <em>Granda, </em>asking a traveler whether he is carrying more than $5,000 inspires the belief that it is illegal to bring large sums of money into the United States. When customs officials do not disabuse travelers of that belief, an exculpatory \u201cno\u201d response to the question is outside the scope of 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1001.</p>\n<p id=\"b1284-4\">REVERSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1280-8\">. \u00a7 1001.

It bears emphasis that the basis of Count I is Schnaiderman\u2019s initial oral denial to Randall that he was carrying more than $5,000, not the written denial on the customs declaration Form 6059-B. We assume, without deciding, that the statute (see note 2, supra) which speaks specifically in terms of the duty to \u201cfile a report or reports\u201d is violated by a knowing false oral statement.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1281-8\">.

In a case such as this, the proper instruction would include some discussion of the defendant\u2019s ignorance of the law since the defendant\u2019s alleged ignorance of the reporting requirements goes to the heart of his or her denial of the specific intent necessary to commit the crime. <em>See United States v. Schilleci, </em>545 F.2d 519, 524 (5th Cir. 1977). Failure of the defendant to have the benefit of this instruction was plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b1281-18\"><em>Id. </em>at 926. We point out in passing that the instruction given at the Schnaiderman trial did not include a discussion of defendant\u2019s ignorance of the law and suffers from the same defect which constituted plain error in <em>Granda. </em>However, since defense counsel did not object to the instruction given on specific intent nor is it challenged on this appeal, we do not base our reversal on this ground.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b1282-9\">.
