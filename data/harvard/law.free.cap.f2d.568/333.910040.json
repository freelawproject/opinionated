The Secretary cross-appeals from a final order of the District Court granting summary judgment in favor of one blind plaintiff, Lillian Carney.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-23\">At issue in both appeals is the proper interpretation of \u00a7 1611(h) of the Social Security Act Amendments of 1972, Pub.L. No. 92-603, tit. Ill, \u00a7 301, which provides that, in determining the amount of Supplemental Security Income benefits for blind persons, there shall be disregarded the greater of either the amount that could have been disregarded under the former state plan or the amount which would be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>disregarded under the relevant provisions of the Supplemental Security Income program. The District Court agreed with the plaintiffs that in addition to those forms of income specifically directed to be disregarded under the prior Pennsylvania plan, \u00a7 1611(h) mandates that the Secretary disregard income which, because of the state plan\u2019s assessment of basic, special, and spousal needs, would have been excluded from the computation of benefits under the state plan. However, the District Court declined to order that this interpretation be applied to all Pennsylvania blind recipients of Supplemental Security Income benefits because, except for Carney, the plaintiffs had not, when the suit was filed, exhausted administrative remedies. Liberty Alliance contends that, although the precise computation of benefits would vary among the individual claimants, the legal issue of the interpretation of \u00a7 1611(h) is common to all blind claimants in Pennsylvania and, thus, the Court should have afforded class action relief in order to obviate the necessity for multiple administrative and judicial proceedings litigating the identical issue. The Secretary urges, first, that the District Court misconstrued \u00a7 1611(h) in Carney\u2019s case and, second, that even if the Court\u2019s construction is accepted, that ruling cannot benefit any other claimant because the rule requiring exhaustion of administrative remedies bars class relief even as to a question of law. We affirm the District Court\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 1611(h), but reverse its decision that the failure of each individual claimant to exhaust administrative remedies barred class relief. Therefore, we remand the case to the District Court for a determination of the appropriateness of permitting the case to proceed as a class action.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-4\">I. THE SECRETARY\u2019S APPEAL IN LILLIAN CARNEY\u2019S CASE</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">Under Title X of the Social Security Act of 1935<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the Federal Government assumed responsibility for helping the states to provide public assistance payments to the needy blind by providing matching funds for approved assistance plans. The Act required the states, in determining the need for assistance, to consider the income and resources of the claimants. Because some states, including Pennsylvania, rendered assistance to blind persons who already had some minimum income and resources, these states did not initially qualify for federal matching funds. In a major revision of the Act, the Social Security Act Amendments of 1950,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Congress addressed that issue. Senate Report No. 1669<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> on the bill which became the 1950 Amendments Act states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AH_\">Under title X of the Social Security Act the States are required, in determining the need for assistance, to take into consideration the income and resources of claimants of aid to the blind. Your committee believes this requirement stifles incentive and discourages the needy blind from becoming self-supporting and that therefore it should be replaced by a requirement that would assist blind individuals in becoming useful and productive members of their communities. Accordingly, the committee-approved bill would require all States administering federally approved aid to the blind programs to disregard earned income up to $50 per month of claimants of aid to the blind beginning July 1, 1952. The exemption of earnings would be discretionary with each State prior to that date so the State legislatures will be afforded an opportunity to make any necessary changes in their aid to the blind laws to conform to the new requirement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-11\">Aid to the needy blind, in the judgment of your committee, is not in the same category with assistance programs for other needy individuals. Opportunities for gainful employment for blind individuals are limited and their necessary ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>penditures are increased by the need for special books, for special medical treatment in some cases, and for guide service and readers. As with concessions and special provisions for the blind in other laws, the exemption of earnings up to $50 per month is not regarded by your committee as a precedent for similar treatment for individuals who are not blind.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A7k\">In recognition of blind persons\u2019 special needs, the 1950 Amendments Act embodied the policy of treating them differently from other public assistance beneficiaries. The Act qualified the standard requirement \u201cthat the State agency shall, in determining need, take into consideration any other income and resources of the individual claiming aid\u201d with the proviso \u201cexcept that, in making such determination, the State agency shall disregard the first $50 per month of earned income.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Thus the concept of disregarding income and resources of blind persons, which did not appear in other public assistance programs, was introduced into the Social Security Act. The formula for such disregards was changed over the years. Its last version appears in 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1202(a)(8).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b407-5\">(a) A state plan for aid to the blind must ... (8) provide that the State Agency shall, in determining need, take into consideration any other income and resources of the individual claiming aid to the blind, as well as any expenses reasonably attributable to the earning of any such income, except that, in making such determination, the State Agency (A) shall disregard the first $85 per month of earned income, plus one-half of earned income in excess of $85 per month, (B) shall, for a period not in excess of twelve months, and may, for a period not in excess of thirty-six months, disregard such additional amounts of other income and resources, in the ease of an individual who has a plan for achieving self-support approved by the State Agency, as may be necessary for the fulfillment of such plan, and (C) may, before disregarding the amounts referred to in clauses (A) and (B), disregard not more than $7.50\u2019of any income .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b407-9\">As this statutory subsection indicates, in the years 1972-1974 the Title X public assistance program for blind persons recognized both mandatory and optional disregards of income and resources.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-10\">When, in 1950, Congress was considering the concept of special disregards of income and resources of publicly assisted blind persons, Pennsylvania was not a participant in the Title X program. Senate Report No. 1669 discusses the Pennsylvania problem:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Auo\">Pennsylvania has been negotiating for some time with the Social Security Administration to arrive at a basis by which it could develop a plan for aid to the blind that could be approved as conforming to the requirements of the Social Security Act. To help in solving the issue which has stood in the way of accepting the plan proposed by Pennsylvania and to facilitate formulation of acceptable plans by other States that do not at the present time have approved plans, the bill would amend title X. The bill would provide that, for an interim period, the Federal Security Administrator shall approve a plan of such State for aid to the blind, even though it does not meet the requirement in title X of the act, as amended, relating to the determination of need and consideration of resources, if the plan meets all other requirements. The amendment would provide, however, that Federal participation shall be available only with respect to expenditures which would be approvable under the requirements of title X, clause (8), section 1002(a) of the act, as amended by the bill. This amendment would be effective only for the period October 1,1950, to June 30, 1953. Your committee believes that this period of time will enable the States concerned to amend their laws and develop' <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>aid-to-blind plans that conform in all respects with the requirements of title X.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b408-4\">The source of Pennsylvania\u2019s problem apparently was that its plan was more generous in disregarding income and resources of blind persons than was the Federal Government\u2019s. Section 344(a) of Pub.L. No. 81\u2014 734, ch. 809, 64 Stat. 554, provided for Pennsylvania\u2019s program and for states with similar plans:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-5\">In the case of any State which did not have on January 1, 1949, a State plan for aid to the blind approved under title X of the Social Security Act, the Administrator shall approve a plan of such State for aid to the blind for the purposes of such title X, even though it does not meet the requirements of clause (8) of section 1002(a) of the Social Security Act, if it meets all other requirements of such title X for an approved plan for aid to the blind; but payments under section 1003 of the Social Security Act shall be made, in the case of any such plan, only with respect to expenditures thereunder which would be included as expenditures for the purposes of such section under a plan approved under such title X without regard to the provisions of this Section.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b408-6\">This provision of \u00a7 344 is codified in the last sentence of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1202. The authority to approve a plan not in conformity with clause (8) of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1202(a) was limited by \u00a7 344(b) to a period of five years. However, this limitation was not included in the codified version, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1202(a) &amp; (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b408-7\">The record before us does not disclose when Pennsylvania\u2019s plan for public assistance to the blind was approved, whether that plan was approved as conforming to clause (8), or whether it was approved pursuant to the special exception to clause (8) present in \u00a7 344(b). But it is undisputed that Pennsylvania had, in 1972 and 1973, an approved plan, the terms of which are set forth in the Pennsylvania Department of Welfare, Office of Income Maintenance, Public Assistance Manual \u00a7\u00a7 3410-3420.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-8\">In 1972 Congress enacted a major revision of the Social Security Act. Germane to blind persons was the congressional decision to repeal Title X of the 1935 Social Security Act and to substitute for federal matching grants to the states a new program which would be administered and funded federally. The bill, which became the Social Security Amendments of 1972,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> was H.R. 1 in the second session of the Ninety-second Congress, Title III of which dealt with the new federal program for the aged, blind, and disabled. H.R. 1 set forth federal standards, including income and resource limitations, for the determination of benefits. These proposed federal income and resource standards were not identical either with the disregard provisions of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1202(a)(8) or with the provisions of Pennsylvania\u2019s approved plan. H.R. 1 was eventually enacted, with the new Supplemental Security Income benefits replacing the former federal-state assistance program, effective January 1, 1974. As enacted, however, Pub.L. No.' 92-603 contained two provisions (among others not relevant here) which did not appear in the original bill. These provisions were subsections (g) and (h) of \u00a7 1611, the section of the new title dealing with the eligibility of blind persons for benefits:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-9\">Certain Individuals Deemed to Meet Resources Test</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-10\">(g) In the case of any individual or any individual and his spouse (as the case may be) who for the month of December 1973 was a recipient of aid or assistance under a State plan approved under title I, X, XIV, or XVI, the resources of such individual or such individual and his spouse shall be deemed not to exceed the amount specified in sections 1611(a)(1)(B) and 1611(a)(2)(B) during any period that the resources of such individual or individual and his spouse (as the case may be) does not exceed the maximum amount of resources, as specified in the State plan (above referred to, and as in effect in October 1972) under which he or they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>were entitled to aid or assistance for the month of December 1972.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-5\">Certain Individuals Deemed to Meet Income Test</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-6\">(h) In determining eligibility for, and the amount of, benefits payable under this section in the case of any individual or any individual and his spouse (as the case may be) who is blind (as that term is defined under a State plan approved under title X or XVI as in effect in October 1972) and who for the month of December 1973 was a recipient of aid or assistance under a State plan approved under title X or XVI, there shall be disregarded an amount equal to the greater of the amounts determined as follows\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-7\">(1) the maximum amount of any earned or unearned income which could have been disregarded under the State plan (above referred to, and as in effect in October 1972), or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-8\">(2) the amount which would be required to be disregarded under section 1612 without application of this subsection.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b409-9\">42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1382(g) &amp; (h).</p>\n<p id=\"b409-10\">These so-called grandfather clauses, particularly subsection (h), produced the instant lawsuit. Mrs. Carney contends that while the overall intention of the 1972 Amendments may have been to substitute a uniform federal Supplemental Security Income program for the former state public assistance programs, in which net benefits varied from state to state, the purpose of the grandfather clauses was to prevent any diminution in net benefits in those states whose programs were more generous than the new federal program. The Secretary contends that this is only partly true. He concedes that \u00a7 1611(g), the grandfather clause dealing with the disregard of re<em>sources, </em>cross-references to the state plan under which the claimant was receiving benefits prior to the effective date of the new program. But he urges that the <em>income </em>disregards grandfather clause of \u00a7 1611(h) does not cross-reference to those Pennsylvania plan provisions which, because of spousal and other special needs, did not include certain amounts of income in the claimant\u2019s need determination, but rather to other provisions which only disregarded specific types, and very small amounts, of income. The Secretary reasons that the variance in wording between the two subsections of \u00a7 1611 suggests that Congress intended a single federal income definition.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In effect, the Secretary argues that Congress intended a uniform federal standard for income disregards. He refers us to no legislative history which bolsters that interpretation, however, and neither counsel has even traced the origins of the amendments to H.R. 1 which resulted in the two statutory subsections.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-14\">Our research discloses that the Senate Finance Committee would initially have continued state administration of public assistance to the aged, blind, and disabled, with federal standards for income disregards, but with the states remaining free to be more generous in certain respects.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The Senate eventually agreed to the House of Representatives version transferring the program to the Social Security Administration. The grandfather clause respecting the disregard of resources originated in the Senate as a floor amendment by Senator Cranston.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> We have been unable to determine when or how the income disregards grandfather clause made its way into the bill. We do know, however, that that clause was in the bill by October 17, 1972, for the Summary of Social Security Amendments of 1972 as approved by the Conferees contains the following language:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b410-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>\n<em>Earned Income Disregard</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A4_\">In addition to a monthly disregard of $20 of social security or other income, there would be an additional disregard of $65 of earned income plus one-half of any earnings above $65. This will enable those aged, blind, and disabled individuals who are able to do some work to do so and in the process given them a higher income in addition to supplemental security income.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Akz\">In addition, as under present law, any income necessary for the fulfillment of a plan for achieving self-support would be disregarded for persons qualifying on the basis of blindness. <em>A savings clause would </em>assure <em>that blind persons would not receive any reduction in benefits due to those </em>provisions.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"A4Hs\">(Emphasis supplied.)</p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">If, as stated above, the purpose of the savings clause was to assure that blind persons would not \u201creceive any reductions in benefits,\u201d it would seem that the Secretary\u2019s construction of \u00a7 1611(h) is incorrect, for under that construction some blind persons could suffer reductions in benefits. Moreover, despite the slight variation in wording between \u00a7 1611(g) and \u00a7 1611(h), they both are patently aimed at the same problem \u2014 a state plan which was more generous in disregarding resources and income than the succeeding federal plan. We think that taken together subsections (g) and (h) must be read as cross-references to the state plan\u2019s complete provisions for disregarding resources and income as they actually operated through December 31, 1973.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-11\">Complicating the picture further, however, is an uncodified statute, Title II of Pub.L. No. 93-66, which became law on July 9, 1973, prior to the effective date of the provisions of the 1972 amendments relating to the blind. Title I of Pub.L. No. 93-66 is a one sentence extender of the Renegotiation Act of 1951, which has nothing to do with the Social Security Act. Title II contains provisions relating to the Social Security Act, including amendments to \u00a7 1611(a) and (b), the federal income disregards provisions. The statute amends \u00a7 1611(g) in a manner not here relevant, but does not deal .with \u00a7 1611(h). The Secretary contends, however, that \u00a7 212 of Pub.L. No. 93-66 operates as an additional grandfather clause which must be read in pari materia with \u00a7 1611(g). That statute appears to condition a state\u2019s eligibility for federal assistance in some programs on the state\u2019s implementation of a supplementary payments plan. Section 212 of Pub.L. No. 93-66 is a model of obscurity.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The Secretary says:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b411-10\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>(ii) the amount of the income of such individual (other than the aid or assistance described in clause (i)) received by such individual in December 1973, minus any such income which did not result, but which if properly reported would have resulted in a reduction in the amount of such aid or assistance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>This statute provides for mandatory state payments in supplement to the Federal SSI payments to the extent that a recipient\u2019s SSI benefit plus other current income is less than his state grant amount plus other income as of December 1973.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Au9\">Appellee\u2019s Brief, at 4. He would have us read \u00a7 212 and \u00a7 1611(h) together to mean that the federal standard for income disregards applies, but that where a \u25a0 former state plan used different terminology, such as \u201cspecial needs,\u201d in determining the level of. benefits, the state, not the federal government, would be obliged to continue such payments.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The record does not disclose whether Pennsylvania has in effect an agreement with the Secretary pursuant to \u00a7 212, but the briefs seem to assume so.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-4\">Mrs. Carney interprets \u00a7 212 as establishing a separate \u201cminimum income level\u201d floor on benefits for grandfathered Supplemental Security Income recipients. She contends that this statute has nothing to do with the question which \u00a7\u00a7 1611(g) and (h) addressed-namely, whether a blind person would continue to receive the equivalent total package of benefits, including potential disregards of income and resources which were available under the state plan. She urges that the language in \u00a7 1611(h)(1) \u201cwhich could have been disregarded under the State plan (above referred to, and as in effect in October 1972)\u201d must be read as a reference to the entire income calculating mechanism of the state plans. The District Court accepted this interpretation, albeit without addressing the possible effect of \u00a7 212 of Pub.L. No. 93-66. In Mrs. Carney\u2019s case this led to a result at variance with the decision of the administrative agency, because under the Pennsylvania plan more of her spouse\u2019s income was disregarded in calculating her benefits than under the federal statute and regulations. The Social Security hearing examiner had held, and the appeals council had agreed, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>that the Pennsylvania provisions for disregarding spousal income did not apply to Mrs. Carney. The agency did not address the applicability of Pub.L. No. 93-66.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-5\">Not without doubt, and with discomfort over the level of assistance we have received from the parties with respect to the legislative history of these ambiguous statutes, we conclude, as did the District Court, that Mrs. Carney\u2019s construction of \u00a7 1611(h) is the more likely congressional intention. We reach this conclusion for several reasons. We note, first, that the Secretary conceded that \u00a7 1611(g) adopted a nonuniform standard for grandfathered resource disregards. Nothing in the language of \u00a7 1611(h) suggests an intention to depart from that policy decision favoring non-uniformity with respect to income disregards. Secondly, since 1950 federal policy has tolerated departures from uniformity with respect to income disregards, at least for Pennsylvania blind recipients of public assistance. Moreover, because Pub.L. No. 93-66 does not, in so many words, amend \u00a7 1611(h), we think that Pub.L. No. 93-66 should be read, as Mrs. Carney suggests, to create a separate guaranteed minimum income level. As a matter of statutory interpretation, repeals by implication are usually not recognized. <em>See Silver v. New York Stock Exch., </em>373 U.S. 341, 357, 83 S.Ct. 1246, 10 L.Ed.2d 389 (1963), <em>quoting United States v. Borden Co., </em>308 U.S. 188, 198, 60 S.Ct. 182, 84 L.Ed. 181 (1939).</p>\n<p id=\"b413-6\">We recognize the force of the Secretary\u2019s argument that Mrs. Carney\u2019s interpretation grandfathers the entire Pennsylvania state plan with respect to earned, unearned, or spousal income disregards and that the result may be a calculation of assistance payments more favorable to blind recipients with significant amounts of such income than to recipients with little or no outside support. But the policy judgment that blind persons should be treated differently in order to encourage them to be more self-sufficient was made in 1950. In addition, the disparity in treatment between blind persons with income and those without it was a feature of the Pennsylvania plan in effect in 1972. If, as the Secretary urges, it was Congress\u2019 intent to provide for a uniform needs level and to eliminate the vagaries of individual state plans, Congress would not have enacted \u00a7 1611(g) or (h). Apparently blind persons receiving benefits under the former program had an effective advocate in Congress who succeeded in excepting them from the general rule of uniformity.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-9\">This interpretation of \u00a7 1611(h) leads us to affirm the order of the District Court remanding Mrs. Carney\u2019s case to the Secretary for a redetermination of the benefits due her.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-10\">II. THE APPEAL OF LIBERTY ALLIANCE AND THE OTHER CLAIMANTS</p>\n<p id=\"b413-11\">The District Court dismissed the complaint of the remaining nine individuals for lack of jurisdiction on the ground that they had not exhausted administrative remedies and the complaint of Liberty Alliance for lack of standing. The Court denied class action certification because it concluded that there would be no jurisdiction over the members of the alleged class since they had not exhausted administrative remedies, although each member of the class had filed a claim with the Secretary. The effect of the ruling is an interpretation of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g) which precludes the court from requiring the Secretary to apply the legal ruling on \u00a7 1611(h) in favor of claimants whose claims present the identical legal issue. The potential for the multiplication of administrative and judicial review proceedings, and thus for the waste of administrative and judicial resources, is obvious. That prospect suggests that we should give rather strict scrutiny to a statute which, it is claimed, mandates such a result.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b414-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>In <em>Weinberger v. Salfi, </em>422 U.S. 749, 95 S.Ct. 2457, 45 L.Ed.2d 522 (1975), the Supreme Court held that 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g) provides the sole means for obtaining judicial review of the Secretary\u2019s decisions under the Social Security Act. Section 405(g), which is made applicable to the Supplemental Security Income program by virtue of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1383(c)(3), provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b414-4\">(g) Any individual, after any final decision of the Secretary made after a hearing to which he was a party, . may obtain a review of such decision by a civil action commenced within sixty days after the mailing to him of notice of such decision . . . . The court shall have power to enter, upon the pleadings and transcript of the record, a judgment affirming, modifying, or reversing the decision of the Secretary, with or without remanding the cause for a rehearing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AY9\">Section 405(g) does not expressly preclude class relief and, since judicial review is by a civil action, presumably the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, including Rule 23, apply to that action. In <em>Salfi, </em>Justice Rehnquist addressed the class relief problem:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b414-6\">As to class members, however, the complaint is deficient in that it contains no allegations that they have even filed an application with the Secretary, much less that he has rendered any decision, final or otherwise, review of which is sought. The class thus cannot satisfy the requirements for jurisdiction under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b414-7\">422 U.S. at 764, 95 S.Ct. at 2466. In the instant case the class members have filed claims with the Secretary and, although he has not finally passed on each of those claims, he has taken a final position in one of them, Mrs. Carney\u2019s case, at the highest administrative level, on a legal issue common to all the class members.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-8\">In order for a district court properly to entertain an action under \u00a7 405(g), two conditions must be satisfied. First, a claim for benefits must have been presented to the Secretary. Second, there must have been a final decision after a hearing. The Supreme Court has held, however, that only the first condition is a mandatory requirement. The second \u2014 the requirement that the claimant exhaust his administrative remedies \u2014 can be waived either by the Secretary, <em>Mathews </em>v. <em>Diaz, </em>426 U.S. 67, 76, 96 S.Ct. 1883, 48 L.Ed.2d 478 (1976), or, under certain circumstances, by the court on its own determination, <em>Mathews v. Eldridge, </em>424 U.S. 319, 328, 96 S.Ct. 893, 47 L.Ed.2d 18 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b414-10\">The first, non-waivable condition is easily satisfied in this case, with respect to both the individual plaintiffs and the unnamed members of the plaintiff class. In <em>Mathews v. Eldridge, supra, </em>the plaintiff contended that due process required an evidentiary hearing prior to the termination of his Social Security disability benefits. The Supreme Court found that the plaintiff had presented his claim to the Secretary in his answers to a state agency questionnaire and in his letters in response to the tentative determination that his disability had ceased. 424 U.S. at 329, 96 S.Ct. 893. The Court distinguished <em>Salfi </em>on the ground that there the unnamed plaintiffs\u2019 complaints were jurisdictionally deficient since they had not even filed applications with the Secretary. <em>Id. </em>at 328, 96 S.Ct. 893. The instant case is controlled by <em>Eldridge. </em>With the exception of Liberty Alliance, all the plaintiffs are Supplemental Security Income recipients whose benefits have been reduced or terminated. Moreover, the instant suit was not filed until a year and a half of negotiations between Liberty Alliance and the Social Security Administration over the proper interpretation of \u00a7 1611(h) had proven fruitless. This combination of circumstances clearly satisfies the requirement that the claims for benefits be presented to the Secretary.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-11\">It was the finality requirement that formed the basis for the District Court\u2019s decision below, however. In <em>Salfi, </em>Justice Rehnquist, considering the claim of the individual plaintiffs, observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b414-12\">Exhaustion is generally required as a matter of preventing premature interference with agency processes, so that the agency may function efficiently and so <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>that it may have an opportunity to correct its own errors, to afford the parties and the courts the benefits of its experience and expertise, and to compile a record which is adequate for judicial review. Plainly these purposes have been served once the Secretary has satisfied himself that the only issue is the constitutionality of a statutory requirement, a matter which is beyond his jurisdiction to determine, and that the claim is neither otherwise invalid nor cognizable under a different section of the Act. <em>Once </em>a <em>benefit applicant has presented his or her claim at a sufficiently high level of review to satisfy the Secretary\u2019s needs, further exhaustion would not merely be futile for the applicant, but would also be a commitment of administrative resources unsupported by an administrative or judicial interest.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b415-6\">422 U.S. at 765-66, 95 S.Ct. at 2467 (emphasis supplied). Justice Rehnquist\u2019s reasoning about the inutility of exhausting administrative remedies on a legal issue on which the Secretary has had ample opportunity to take a definitive position, and indeed has done so, applies equally to multiple claimants presenting an identical legal issue. Requiring multiple exhaustion on the same issue would involve the same \u201ccommitment of administrative resources unsupported by any administrative or judicial interest\u201d that Justice Rehnquist so aptly condemned in <em>Salfi. </em>Resolution of the issue in a single judicial review proceeding conserves both administrative and judicial resources.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-7\">As mentioned earlier, the finality requirement under \u00a7 405(g) has been described by the Supreme Court as \u201cwaivable.\u201d Although we recognize that the determination of administrative finality ordinarily rests with the Secretary, we believe that the instant case belongs to that category of cases \u201cwhere a claimant\u2019s interest in having a particular issue resolved promptly is so great that deference to the agency\u2019s judgment is inappropriate.\u201d <em>Mathews v. Eldridge, </em>424 U.S. 319, 330, 96 S.Ct. 893, 900 (1976). In <em>Eldridge, </em>Justice Powell, writing for the Court, interpreted \u00a7 405(g) to permit a reviewing court, under some circumstances, to make its own judgment as to whether the needs of the administrative process had been satisfied. There the plaintiff\u2019s constitutional challenge was collateral to his substantive claim of entitlement. Most importantly, the plaintiff had raised \u201cat least a colorable claim that because of his physical condition and dependency upon the disability benefits, an erroneous termination would damage him in a way not recompensable through retroactive payments.\u201d 424 U.S. at 331, 96 S.Ct. at 901. Like Eldridge, the plaintiffs here are largely dependent upon public assistance payments. An erroneous termination or substantial reduction of this assistance would severely burden their subsistence. Requiring each plaintiff fully to exhaust his administrative remedies, especially where, as here, such exhaustion would be futile, would increase this burden. Moreover, in the exercise of its statutory authority recognized in <em>Eldridge, </em>a reviewing court certainly can take into consideration its own interest in preventing multiple judicial review proceedings in cases presenting a legal issue upon which the Secretary has had a full opportunity to make, and has made, an informed, final judgment.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b415-10\">The only facial difference between <em>Eldridge </em>and the instant case is that in <em>Eldridge </em>the plaintiff\u2019s challenge was a constitutional one, while here it is statutory. <em>Salfi </em>teaches us that if the legal issue is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>constitutional, since the administrative agency cannot decide that issue, no exhaustion is required. 422 U.S. at 765, 95 S.Ct. 2457. Cf. <em>Johnson v. Robison, </em>415 U.S. 361, 366, 94 S.Ct. 1160, 39 L.Ed.2d 389 (1974); <em>Leedom v. Kyne, </em>358 U.S. 184, 79 S.Ct. 180, 3 L.Ed.2d 210 (1958). Where the legal issue is statutory, however, the agency does have authority to decide it, subject of course to judicial review. The test for exhaustion of a statutory issue in an individual case, we believe, should be whether the Secretary has taken a final position on that issue. In the class context the test should be no different. In the instant case that test has been met. In negotiations with Liberty Alliance, the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare has stated its position that the Secretary\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 1611(h) is firm and that this interpretation will not be modified except as dictated by legislative action or by the courts.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> That firm position has been confirmed in this lawsuit, in which one plaintiff, Mrs. Carney, has fully exhausted all available administrative review. No interest of the agency requires the multiple exhaustion of the same issue by blind class members, who are obviously in strained circumstances and unusually dependent upon the benefits in question. The plaintiffs\u2019 interest in prompt resolution of the legal issue is clear. The judiciary\u2019s interest in avoiding multiple applications for review is equally clear.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-4\">Even if this were not a case governed by the <em>Eldridge </em>principle, we believe that the Secretary has waived any objections to the failure of the individual plaintiffs and of the class members to exhaust their administrative remedies. In <em>Mathews v. Diaz, </em>426 U.S. 67, 75-77, 96 S.Ct. 1883 (1976), the Supreme Court held that a court can independently determine whether the Secretary has waived the exhaustion requirement, even if the Secretary has moved to dismiss the action on the ground that the plaintiff did not exhaust administrative remedies. In concluding that the Secretary had waived the exhaustion requirement, the Court in <em>Diaz </em>reasoned that there were no facts in dispute, that the Secretary had filed a motion for summary judgment, and that the only issue was a constitutional one. As in <em>Diaz, </em>the Secretary here filed a motion for summary judgment, thus suggesting that the case was appropriate for judicial resolution. In addition, although the computation of each claimant\u2019s benefits turns on the intricacies of each case, these intricacies are not in dispute here. The only issue in dispute is the proper interpretation of \u00a7 1611(h). Finally, for the same reasons as discussed earlier, since the Secretary has taken a final position on the statutory interpretation issue, the fact that the issue here is statutory, while the issue in <em>Diaz </em>was constitutional, is not a controlling distinction.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-7\">The sensible construction of \u00a7 405(g) in <em>Salfi, Eldridge, </em>and <em>Diaz </em>accommodates the sometimes competing needs of the administrative process for time in which to arrive at a mature judgment on often complex legal issues, of the judicial process for the avoidance of multiple applications for judicial review, and of similarly situated benefit applicants for the avoidance of futile administrative delays in the determination of their benefits. That construction does not preclude, and indeed can accommodate, class relief for identifiable benefits claimants on whose behalf claims have been or will be filed. <em>See Jimenez v. Weinberger, </em>523 F.2d 689 (7th Cir. 1975) (Stevens, Circuit Judge), <em>cert. denied, </em>427 U.S. 916, 96 S.Ct. 3200, 49 L.Ed.2d 1204 (1976) (holding that class action relief is available to enforce claims arising under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g) and that such an action tolls the statute of limitations for class members who later file claims).</p>\n<p id=\"b416-8\">The Secretary argues that despite the common legal issue \u2014 the interpretation of \u00a7 1611(h) \u2014 class relief is nevertheless inappropriate because the mathematical calculation of benefits, even under the Pennsylvania formula, will vary from claimant to claimant. The sterility of that conten<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>tion is best illustrated by the relief which the District Court ordered in Mrs. Carney\u2019s individual case. The Court did not make the calculation of her benefits. Instead, it afforded judicial review of the Secretary\u2019s statutory interpretation and, as \u00a7 405(g) expressly provides, remanded for a rehearing at the agency level, where the benefits could be redetermined. Once either interpretation of the statute \u2014 the Secretary\u2019s or Liberty Alliance\u2019s \u2014 was accepted, the individual calculations could be made by the agency.. The need for such calculations is no reason for barring class relief with respect to the common legal issue which will determine the formula under which these calculations will be made. <em>See generally </em>Chayes, <em>The Role of the Judge in Public Law Litigation, </em>89 Harv.L.Rev. 1281 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">Thus the District Court erred in concluding that \u00a7 405(g) proscribed class relief. The issues which the Court should have focused on are (1) whether an identifiable class of claimants had filed with the Secretary claims which presented a common legal issue on which the administrative agency had taken a final position and (2) whether the party seeking judicial review is an adequate representative for that class of blind claimants. In this case Mrs. Carney, at least, would appear to qualify as an adequate class representative. Moreover, there is no immediately apparent reason why \u00a7 405(g) should not be interpreted, like \u00a7 10 of the Administrative Procedure Act, to permit an organization like Liberty Alliance, whose members are claimants aggrieved by the Secretary\u2019s action, to seek judicial review on behalf of those of its members for whom claims have been filed. <em>See, e. g., Sierra Club </em>v. <em>Morton, </em>405 U.S. 727, 735, 92 S.Ct. 1361, 31 L.Ed.2d 636 (1972). Liberty Alliance also urges that as an organization it suffered injury .in fact from the agency\u2019s action by virtue of the loss of credibility it suffered due to its prior advice to its members about the meaning of \u00a7 1611(h). We express no view as to whether such an injury would confer standing on Liberty Alliance to seek judicial review within the meaning of \u00a7 405(g), since it seems unlikely that in determining the class action motion the District Court will have to reach the issue. In addition, since a class action determination involves the exercise of discretion in several respects and since authority for its exercise is conferred by Rule 23 on the district court in the first instance, we do not hold that a class action must be entertained. We hold only that the District Court erred in concluding that class relief was proscribed by \u00a7 405(g) and that class certification must be reconsidered. But certainly on the record before us no reason appears why such certification should be denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-7\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b417-8\">The order remanding Mrs. Carney\u2019s case to the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare will be affirmed. The order dismissing the complaint of the remaining plaintiffs and denying the motion for class action certification will be vacated and the case remanded to the District Court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b406-6\">.

The Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in <em>Mathews v. Diaz, </em>426 U.S. 67, 75-76, 96 S.Ct. 1883 (1976), confirms that the only non-waivable requirement of \u00a7 405(g) is the claim-filing requirement and that informalities in the method of filing may be disregarded so long as the claim is presented to the agency in a manner which affords it the opportunity to act. In <em>Diaz </em>the Court held that the Secretary had waived the exhaustion requirement. In reaching this decision, the Court gave no indication that it was retreating from the <em>Eldridge </em>position that in some instances the court could make its own decision as to the appropriateness of further administrative consideration of a legal issue.
