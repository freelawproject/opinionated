A jury found the appellants guilty on five counts of making extortionate extensions of credit in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 892, and with four counts of violating 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 894. The court entered a judgment notwithstanding the verdict on those counts charging the making of extortionate extensions of credit.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-18\">The appellants raise two issues on appeal. The first raises the question whether conviction is barred if all the Government\u2019s witnesses deny at trial that any threats were made, or that they were ever put in fear; the second, whether the trial court\u2019s ruling permitting the introduction of evidence showing collection practices was improper hearsay and prejudicial to the appellants.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-19\">We conclude that there was sufficient evidence to support the jury\u2019s verdict relating to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 894, and that the court\u2019s ruling admitting Mr. Hastings\u2019 testimony concerning the appellants\u2019 collection practices in the community was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-20\">The statute under which the appellants were convicted prohibits knowing participation in the use of extortionate means to attempt the collection of a debt. \u201cExtortionate means\u201d is defined as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b870-21\">\u201c. . . [A]ny means which involves the use, or an express or implicit threat of use, of violence or other criminal means to cause harm to the person, reputation, or property of any person.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 891(7).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b870-23\">The Government\u2019s evidence consisted primarily of testimony from persons who had borrowed money from May Jordan; the testimony of several special agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation who had analyzed the interest rates appellants charged on some of these accounts, and who interviewed witnesses before trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-24\">The evidence in substance showed that appellant, May Jordan, was in the business of loaning money, and examples of loans were testified to. For example, she loaned $80.00 to Arizona Jackson, and the loan agreement required the borrower to pay back $120.00 in thirty days. When she was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"801\">*801</page-number>unable to pay, the appellant raised that amount from $120.00 to $180.00, which was to be paid out at $20.00 per month. Another example, Myrtle Hastings borrowed $50.00 from appellant, and was to repay $100.00 in one month. Linda Blaine borrowed money from May Jordan, and testified that the appellant would \u201cwhip\u201d her if she didn\u2019t pay her debt. She also testified that she had seen May Jordan carry a gun, but that since she paid her debts, there was no reason to be frightened. Donald Hastings borrowed money, and was unable to make payment as agreed upon. He testified that May Jordan said Mr. Hastings could not outrun appellant, or that he could not \u201cwhip\u201d her. Mary Allen also borrowed money from the appellants, but was unable to repay it as agreed. Eddie Jordan called upon Miss Allen at her home. She testified that he came inside carrying a shotgun, sat down, placed the shotgun on his lap, and said that he was going to get the money he was owed one way or another.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-5\">Of those who borrowed money from May Jordan, only Miss Allen testified at the trial that appellants\u2019 reputation in the community was that they \u201cclimbed on people,\u201d frightening them about receiving their money. With this exception, all witnesses indicated at trial that neither May Jordan nor her brother, Eddie Jordan, ever used extortionate means to collect a debt. Arizona Jackson\u2019s testimony was indicative, direct, and to the point:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b871-6\">\u201cQ. Now, you are not telling us that May ever came over and threatened you, did she?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b871-7\">\u201cA. May never threatened me nary a time. I said that in the beginning and I will say it again in the ending, she have never threatened me.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b871-8\">The jury had also the testimony of special agent Errol Myers:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b871-9\">\u201cQ. Mr. Myers, as the agent in charge of this case, you personally went out and took the statements from, I think, every one of the witnesses that testified for the Government, did you not?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b871-10\">\u201cA. I did, with the exception of Linda Blaine, I, I, uh, didn\u2019t take that statement myself. Mr. Anderson did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b871-11\">\u201cQ. Okay. The statements that you did take from every witness but Linda Blaine, did the people give you \u2014 when you talked to them, did they tell you the same story as to what occurred as they have testified to here in court?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b871-12\">\u201cA. Yes, they did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b871-13\">\u201cQ. Were there any changes made at all that you noticed?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b871-14\">\u201cA. They had indicated that they were, that they were in fear at the time that they \u2014 borrowing the money, at the time \u2014 The only change is that they sort of backed out on us on some of the things that they had originally told us when they got on the stand, as far as actual threats being made to them and actually being in fear and that type of statement, yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b871-15\">\u201cQ. Who specifically did these people tell you originally that they were afraid of?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b871-16\">\u201cA. Well, May, Eddie \u2014 May and Eddie mostly. . . . \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b871-17\">The appellants claim that the evidence the Government produced was insufficient as a matter of law because \u201csome testimony-in-chief from, an alleged victim was essential to prove the necessary element of the crime, the use of extortionate means.\u201d There is no controlling authority in the Tenth Circuit on this question. In <em>United States v. DeLutro, </em>435 F.2d 255 (2d Cir.), the court held that a defendant who used extortionate means to collect his debt could still be convicted, even where his victim denied at trial that any threats were made, or that he was ever put in fear. We agree with <em>DeLutro </em>and must reject the notion that the silencing of a victim at trial can absolutely eliminate the possibility of a conviction. <em>See generally United States v. Quintana, </em>457 F.2d 874 (10th Cir.). The evidence summarized does not show, with one exception, that any threats of violence for failure to pay debts were made directly to those who borrowed money from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"802\">*802</page-number>appellants. The threat of violent consequences comes from the general nature of all the loan and collection transactions, and from defendants\u2019 reputation in the community. The testimony of Myrtle Hastings is characteristic:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b872-4\">\u201cQ. Has May ever threatened you personally?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b872-5\">\u201cA. No, she hasn\u2019t threatened me at all.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b872-6\">\u201cQ. Has she ever made threats to you about your children and them not paying their debts to her?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b872-7\">\u201cA. She talked about whipping Linda.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b872-8\">\u201cQ. Well, what exactly, who are you talking about now, May?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b872-9\">\u201cA. May, yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b872-10\">\u201cQ. What did May say?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b872-11\">\u201cA. Well, she just said she would whip Linda.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b872-12\">\u201cQ. Did she say she would whip Linda?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b872-13\">\u201cA. She said she would whip Linda, she didn\u2019t mention Eddie.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b872-14\">\u201cQ. All right. Now, you said that she would whip Linda if what?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b872-15\">\u201cA. If she didn\u2019t pay it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b872-16\">\u201cQ. Under what circumstances was she going to whip Linda? What would have to happen if she was going to whip Linda?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b872-17\">\u201cA. If Linda didn\u2019t pay her her money, that she was going to whip Linda.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b872-18\">\u201cQ. Have you ever known May to carry a gun?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b872-19\">\u201cQ. I seen ... I haven\u2019t seen May with a gun but once.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b872-20\">From all the evidence presented below we conclude there was sufficient evidence from which a jury could find that extortionate means were used in an attempt to collect an extension of credit.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-21\">The defendants contend also that the trial court erred in permitting Mr. Hastings to testify concerning general debt collection practices of the appellants. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 894(c) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b872-22\">\u201cIn any prosecution under this section . the court may in its discretion allow evidence to be introduced tending to show the reputation of the defendant in any community of which the person against whom the alleged threat was made was a member at the time of the collection or attempt at collection.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b872-24\">Mr. Hastings was questioned concerning the appellants:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b872-25\">\u201cQ. Tell me this, what is the reputation in the community as to their collection practices? People who don\u2019t pay them, what happens to them?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b872-26\">\u201cA. Well, I heard, you know, from what I heard on the streets, you know, that if you borrow anything from them, that you\u2019d better pay it or they will come get you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b872-27\">\u201cQ. Okay. Who\u2019s the \u2018they\u2019 that\u2019s going to come get you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b872-28\">\u201cA. Well, once, I heard that Jessie would be one.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b872-29\">\u201cQ. Jessie? Who\u2019s Jessie?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b872-30\">\u201cA. This one right here.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b872-31\">\u201cQ. Oh, Jessie sitting right back here in the green\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b872-32\">\u201cA. Shirt.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b872-33\">\u201cQ. \u2014vest, is that him?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b872-34\">\u201cA. Yes-</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b872-35\">\u201cQ. Who is Jessie?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b872-36\">\u201cA. Her brother, I think.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b872-37\">\u201cQ. That\u2019s May\u2019s brother?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b872-38\">\u201cA. May\u2019s brother.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b872-39\">\u201cQ. Right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b872-40\">\u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b872-41\">\u201cQ. What\u2019s the word on the street Jessie is going to do to you if you don\u2019t pay your \u2014 pay the money to May and Eddie?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b872-42\">\u201cA. Whip the head, I guess, whip your _ <em>1)</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b872-43\">Appellants urge us to find that admission of such testimony was error. It is, however, our conclusion that the admission of such testimony is well within the confines of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 894(c). It is apparent that there has been no abuse of discretion in applying this standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-44\">The judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
