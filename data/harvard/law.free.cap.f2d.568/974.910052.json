KAUFMAN, Chief Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b1045-12\">The seemingly narrow issue before us \u2014 the scope of protection afforded by the First Amendment to the compelled disclosure of the editorial process \u2014 has broad implications. Called upon to decide whether, and to what extent, a public figure bringing a libel action may inquire into a journalist\u2019s thoughts, opinions and conclusions in preparing a broadcast, we must address initially the fundamental relationship between the First Amendment guarantee of a free press and the teaching of <em>New York Times v. Sullivan, </em>376 U.S. 254, 84 S.Ct. 710, 11 L.Ed.2d 686 (1964). In accommodating both these interests within our constitutional scheme, we find that due regard to the First Amendment requires that we afford a privilege to disclosure of a journalist\u2019s exercise of editorial control and judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1045-13\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b1045-14\">Almost two centuries ago, James Madison decried the Sedition Act of 1798 as a basic departure from our nation\u2019s commitment to a free and untrammeled press. He wrote,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AJO\">Among those principles deemed sacred in America, among those sacred rights considered as forming the bulwark of their liberty, which the government contemplates with awful reverence and would approach only with the most cautious circumspection, there is no one of which the importance is more deeply impressed on the public mind than the liberty of the press.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1045-15\">The force of his words has not diminished over time. We still recognize that an unrestrained press plays a vital role in the marketplace of ideas and that, without active trade in that marketplace, democracy cannot survive. Cf. <em>Garrison v. Louisiana, </em>379 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"976\">*976</page-number>U.S. 64-75, 85 S.Ct. 209, 13 L.Ed.2d 125 (1964).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1046-4\">Invoking the broad words of the First Amendment, the Supreme Court has never hesitated to forge specific safeguards to insure the continued vitality of the press. It has repeatedly recognized the essentially tripartite aspect of the press\u2019s work and function in: (1) acquiring information,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> (2) \u2018processing\u2019 that information and (3) disseminating the information. The Supreme Court was aware that if any link in that chain were broken, the free flow of information inevitably ceases.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1046-5\">The dissemination of news has long been accorded constitutional protection.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In <em>Near v. Minnesota, </em>283 U.S. 697, 51 S.Ct. 625, 75 L.Ed. 1357 (1931), Chief Justice Hughes, writing for the Court, struck down a Minnesota statute which allowed the state to enjoin the publication of newspapers containing \u201cmalicious, scandalous, and defamatory\u201d matter. The Chief Justice noted that prior restraints on the press were impermissible, notwithstanding the possibility that the information suppressed was libelous. In particular, the fundamental obligation of the press to act as a fourth branch in disclosing official misconduct was stressed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1046-12\">The administration of government has become more complex, the opportunities for malfeasance and corruption have multiplied, crime has grown to most serious proportions, and the danger of its protection by unfaithful officials . . . emphasizes the primary need of a vigilant and courageous press. <em>Id., </em>283 U.S. at 719-20, 51 S.Ct. at 632.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1046-14\">The tenet expressed in <em>Near </em>that prior restraints on publication will not lightly be tolerated has, time and time again, been reiterated under circumstances which accentuate Chief Justice Hughes\u2019s concerns. See, e. g., <em>New York Times v. United States, </em>403 U.S. 713, 91 S.Ct. 2140, 29 L.Ed.2d 822 (1971).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1046-15\">Such anticipatory censorship is not even justified by the presence of a countervailing constitutional interest such as an individual\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"977\">*977</page-number>fair trial.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Before imposing a gag order, the judges have been admonished that they must carefully consider alternative methods to mitigate the effects of pre-trial publicity. Change of venue and other procedures have been suggested. <em>Nebraska Press Association v. Stuart, </em>427 U.S. 539, 562, 96 S.Ct. 2791, 49 L.Ed.2d 683 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b1047-5\">Nor has the Supreme Court shown any hesitation to invalidate restraints on the press which do not follow conventional patterns where it finds the free flow of information imperiled. In <em>Grosjean v. American Press Co., </em>297 U.S. 233, 56 S.Ct. 444, 80 L.Ed. 660 (1936), the Court struck down a tax imposed by the State of Louisiana on newspaper advertisements because it was graduated to reflect circulation levels.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The Court opined that such a tax would lower advertising revenues and restrict circulation. <em>Id. </em>at 244-5, 56 S.Ct. 444.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Even the one governmental control \u2014 antitrust legislation \u2014 that has long been applied to the press and does not contravene the First Amendment has been justified by its instrumental role in insuring the broad distribution of news:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1047-6\">The First Amendment, far from providing an argument against application of the Sherman Act, here provides powerful reasons to the contrary. That Amendment rests on the assumption that the widest possible dissemination of information from diverse and antagonistic sources is essential to the welfare of the public, that a free press is a condition of a free society. <em>Associated Press v. United States, </em>326 U.S. 1, 20, 65 S.Ct. 1416, 1424, 89 L.Ed. 2013 (1945).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1047-13\">The acquisition of newsworthy material stands at the other pole of the press\u2019s function. Freedom to cull information is logically antecedent and necessary to any effective exercise of the right to distribute news. Indeed, the latter prerogative cannot be given full meaning unless the former right is recognized. See Note, <em>The Right of The Press to Gather Information, </em>71 Col.L. Rev. 838 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b1047-14\">The Supreme Court has acknowledged this compelling need.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> In <em>Branzburg </em>v. <em>Hayes, </em>408 U.S. 655, 92 S.Ct. 2646, 33 L.Ed.2d 626 (1972), the Court recognized the right of the press to gather information, since \u201cwithout some protection for seeking out the news, freedom of the press could be eviscerated.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 681, 92 S.Ct. at 2656. Justice Powell, in a concurring opinion, articulated the principle that news gathering is afforded constitutional protection even in the rare case where a reporter was directed to disclose his sources to a grand jury. He noted that a reporter would not be required to furnish information to a grand jury bearing only a remote and tenuous relationship to the subject matter of its investigation. <em>Id. </em>at 711, 92 S.Ct. 2646. See also Goodale, <em>Branzburg v. Hayes and the Developing Privilege for Newsmen, </em>26 Hastings L.J. 709 (1975).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1048-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"978\">*978</page-number>This court has elaborated on the privilege established by <em>Branzburg. </em>In <em>Baker v. F &amp; F Investment, </em>470 F.2d 778, 782-3 (2d Cir. 1972), <em>cert. denied, </em>411 U.S. 966, 93 S.Ct. 2147, 36 L.Ed.2d 686 (1973), we held that a reporter did not have to disclose the source of an article he had written about blockbusting in Chicago, although subpoenaed to do so in a class action charging racial discrimination. We noted that \u201cthere are circumstances ... in which the public interest in non-disclosure of a journalist\u2019s confidential sources outweighs the public and private interest in compelled testimony.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 782. The nature of that public interest was clear: the stream of information would rapidly run dry if confidential sources, fearing the disclosure of their identities, remained silent.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1048-4\">The constitutional protections afforded the dissemination and acquisition of information has inevitably led the Supreme Court to recognize that the editorial process must equally be safeguarded. The media is not a conduit which receives information and, senselessly, spews it forth. The active exercise of human judgment must transform the raw data of reportage into a finished product. The Supreme Court cases which grant protection to the editor so shaping the news are unequivocal in their terms. In <em>Miami Herald Publishing Co. v. Tornillo, </em>418 U.S. 241, 94 S.Ct. 2831, 41 L.Ed.2d 730 (1974), the Court unanimously held that a newspaper could not be compelled by the state to accept editorial replies. The Court recognized that the treatment of public issues and officials \u2014 whether fair or unfair \u2014 constituted the exercise of editorial control and judgment, and that the existence of a right of reply statute would unconstitutionally burden an editor\u2019s exercise of judgment in choosing whether or not to print newsworthy material. <em>Id. </em>at 257, 94 S.Ct. 2831.</p>\n<p id=\"b1048-8\">The Court in <em>Columbia Broadcasting System v. Democratic National Committee, </em>412 U.S. 94, 93 S.Ct. 2080, 36 L.Ed.2d 772 (1973) had, a year earlier, presaged the unqualified statement of <em>Tornillo.</em><footnotemark><em>13</em></footnotemark><em> </em>In holding that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"979\">*979</page-number>broadcasters were not required by the First Amendment to accept paid political advertisements, the Court observed: \u201c . For better or worse, editing is what editors are for; and editing is selection and choice of material.\u201d Specifically, in addressing the issue of whether broadcaster\u2019s decisions constituted state action, Chief Justice Burger noted,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1049-5\">. it would be anomalous for us to hold, in the name of promoting the constitutional guarantees of free expression, that the day-to-day editorial decisions of broadcast licensees are subject to the kind of restraints urged by respondents. To do so in the name of the First Amendment would be a contradiction. <em>Id., </em>412 U.S. at 120-1, 93 S.Ct. at 2095.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1049-6\">It is clear from what we have said that newsgathering and dissemination can be subverted by indirect, as well as direct, restraints. It is equally manifest that the vitality of the editorial process can be sapped too if we are not vigilant. The unambiguous wisdom of <em>Tornillo </em>and <em>CBS </em>is that we must encourage, and protect against encroachment, full and candid discussion within the newsroom itself. In the light of these constitutional imperatives, the issue presented by this case is whether, and to what extent, inquiry into the editorial process, conducted during discovery in a <em>New York Times v. Sullivan </em>type libel action, impermissibly burdens the work of reporters and broadcasters.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1049-13\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1049-14\"><em>New York Times v. Sullivan, </em>applying constitutional principles to the common law of libel, empowered a public figure to vindicate his reputation in an action if he could establish that the statements at issue were knowingly false, or made in reckless disregard of the truth. <em>New York Times v. Sullivan, </em>376 U.S. at 279-80, 84 S.Ct. 710 (1964); <em>Curtis Publishing Co. v. Butts, </em>388 U.S. 130 at 162-5, 170-2, 87 S.Ct. 1975, 18 L.Ed.2d 1094 (1967); <em>Gertz v. Robert Welch, </em>418 U.S. 323, 335 n.6, 94 S.Ct. 2997, 41 L.Ed.2d 789 (1974); <em>Goldwater v. Ginzburg, </em>414 F.2d 324 (2d Cir. 1969), <em>cert. denied, </em>396 U.S. 1049, 90 S.Ct. 701, 24 L.Ed.2d 695 (1970). Later decisions instructed that the <em>Sullivan </em>standard required a subjective inquiry into the defendant\u2019s state of mind. <em>St. Amant v. Thompson, </em>390 U.S. 727, 731, 88 S.Ct. 1323, 20 L.Ed.2d 262 (1968).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1049-15\">While <em>Sullivan </em>left a narrow area for public figures to maintain a libel action, limiting decisions have further refined <em>Sullivan </em>when viewed in the context of the First Amendment.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The opinions applying these additional constraints do so in recognition of the constitutional safeguards cloaking the press, and the need to protect editors and broadcasters. They speak with the same voice as do <em>CBS </em>and <em>Tornillo.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1050-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"980\">*980</page-number>For example, in <em>Buckley v. Littell, </em>539 F.2d 882 (2d Cir. 1976), cert. <em>denied, </em>429 U.S. 1062, 97 S.Ct. 785, 50 L.Ed.2d 777 (1977), we held that statements of opinion could not afford a basis for recovery in a libel case. The reason for this circumscription of libel was clear: the expression of personal opinions and views was fundamental to the need for vigorous debate. Indeed, it is part and parcel of the paramount function of the press \u2014 the dissemination of information. And, just last term, in <em>Edwards v. New York Times Co., </em>556 F.2d 113 (2d Cir. 1977), we held that a newspaper could not libel an individual when the reporter engaged in the neutral reportage of newsworthy material. Our concern there, too, was that the press be unhampered in bringing news to the public.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1050-4\">These reciprocal developments in the law of libel and in freedom of the press narrowly define our task: we must permit only those procedures in libel actions which least conflict with the principle that debate on public issues should be robust and uninhibited. If we were to allow selective disclosure of how a journalist formulated his judgments on what to print or not to print, we would be condoning judicial review of the editor\u2019s thought processes. Such an inquiry, which on its face would be virtually boundless, endangers a constitutionally protected realm, and unquestionably puts a freeze on the free interchange of ideas within the newsroom. A reporter or editor, aware that his thoughts might have to be justified in a court of law, would often be discouraged and dissuaded from the creative verbal testing, probing, and discussion of hypotheses and alternatives which are the <em>sine qua non </em>of responsible journalism. Indeed, the <em>ratio decidendi </em>for <em>Sullivan\u2019s </em>restraints on libel suits is the concern that the exercise of editorial judgment would be chilled.</p>\n<p id=\"b1050-7\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b1050-8\">With these principles set forth, we proceed to traverse the facts before us in some detail. In March 1971, Colonel Anthony Herbert achieved national importance when he formally charged his superior officers, Brigadier General John W. Barnes and Colonel J. Ross Franklin, with covering up war crimes in Vietnam. Herbert claimed, in documents filed with the U.S. Army Criminal Investigation Division (CID), that he had witnessed numerous atrocities while commanding a battalion of the 173rd Airborne Brigade. The most horrifying involved the murder of four prisoners of war by South Vietnamese police in the presence of an American advisor, who callously failed to intervene. Since those killings allegedly occurred on February 14, 1969, Herbert dubbed them the \u201cSt. Valentine\u2019s Day Massacre.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1050-9\">Herbert claimed to have reported all atrocities immediately to Colonel Franklin, deputy commander of the 173rd Airborne, at Brigade Headquarters in Vietnam, and to have brought several to the attention of the Brigade\u2019s commander, General Barnes. But, Herbert alleged, neither was interested in investigating the incidents. When Herbert persisted in pressing his charges, he said that he was abruptly relieved of his command, a determination that was subsequently affirmed by a military appeals tribunal. His removal as battalion commander was attributed to a poor efficiency report authored by Colonel Franklin, which accused Herbert of having \u201cno ambition, integrity, loyalty or will for self-improvement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1050-10\">Herbert\u2019s sudden fall from grace surprised many observers. His long career in the military had been exemplary, under his strong leadership, the second battalion had exhibited extraordinary prowess in battle. His military acumen had earned Herbert <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"981\">*981</page-number>one Silver and three Bronze stars, and he had recently been recommended to receive the Distinguished Service Cross.</p>\n<p id=\"b1051-5\">Herbert\u2019s story fascinated an American public that was increasingly becoming disenchanted with the Vietnam War. In July 1971, he was interviewed by Life Magazine; that September, James Wooten of the New York Times wrote an article favorable to Herbert titled \u201cHow a Supersoldier Was Fired From His Command.\u201d Interviews with the television personality Dick Cavett followed which, according to Cavett, elicited a level of viewer response unmatched by any other single program. In October 1971, Congress became embroiled in the \u201cHerbert affair\u201d when Rep. F. Edward Heber, Chairman of the Armed Services Committee, convinced the Army to remove Herbert\u2019s poor efficiency report from his military record.</p>\n<p id=\"b1051-6\">The Army also thoroughly investigated Herbert's charges of war crimes and, in October 1971, exonerated General Barnes. Armed with this new information, reporters began for the first time to critically examine the veracity of Herbert\u2019s story. During this period of intense public interest, Herbert announced his retirement from the service. He cited, as the reason for his decision, incessant harassment by the military because of his disclosures.</p>\n<p id=\"b1051-7\">\u25a0Barry Lando, an associated producer of the CBS Weekend News, was one of the many individuals interested in the Herbert story. He interviewed Herbert in June 1971 and later produced a laudatory report which was televised on July 4,1971 over the CBS network. A year later, Lando had become a producer for CBS\u2019s documentary news program, \u201c60 Minutes.\u201d He decided to investigate both Herbert\u2019s military career and his charges of cover-up for a comprehensive broadcast on the ensuing controversy. Lando interviewed not only Herbert, Franklin and Barnes, but questioned others, both in and out of the military, who could corroborate Herbert\u2019s claims that he had reported war crimes, and that the military had engaged in a systematic whitewash. Indeed, some of the leads which Lando pursued may have been supplied by Herbert himself during their repeated and extensive conversations. Lando focused on particular allegations. He spent some time in attempting to assay whether Herbert had, in fact, reported the St. Valentine\u2019s Day Massacre to Franklin in Vietnam on February 14, 1969. Since Franklin protested that he was returning from Hawaii on that date, Lando concentrated on this point. Lando obtained Franklin\u2019s hotel bill and a cancelled check in payment of that bill, and interviewed others who could verify Franklin\u2019s activities on the crucial days. Lando also questioned Captain Bill Hill, upon whom Herbert relied to substantiate his story. When Hill recalled that Herbert reported war crimes to someone, he could not say with total certainty that Franklin was the individual.</p>\n<p id=\"b1051-9\">Other allegations were also considered. Lando investigated Herbert\u2019s activities during the eighteen-month period between his relief from command and the filing of formal war crimes charges to determine whether Herbert had apprised other officers in Vietnam of his accusations. In particular, Lando interviewed the highest ranking military lawyer and judge in Vietnam at the time, Colonel John Douglass, who emphatically controverted Herbert\u2019s assertion that war crimes had been brought to his attention. Lando also elicited from Kenneth Rosenbloom, the military attorney and investigator who conducted the Army\u2019s inquiry into Herbert\u2019s allegations, the view that the military\u2019s handling of the charges was beyond reproach.</p>\n<p id=\"b1051-10\">Lando also questioned soldiers who had served under Herbert to determine his qualities as commander. One of these, Sergeant Bruce Potter, reported occasions upon which Herbert had countenanced the commission of war crimes. Potter recounted, for example, an incident in which Herbert had thrown a sand bag out of a helicopter to frighten a war prisoner on the ground into thinking it was a fellow prisoner who had been ejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b1051-11\">During this period, Lando received an uncorrected proof of \u201cSoldier,\u201d a book written by Herbert in collaboration with James <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"982\">*982</page-number>Wooten of the New York Times. Although several of those interviewed by Lando attested to the verity of many of Herbert\u2019s reports, others did not. Thus, Herbert wrote that Captain James Grimshaw had once attempted to drive certain Viet Cong soldiers from a cave without injuring female civilians and children by valiantly entering their hiding place alone. Grimshaw, however, denied the incident had occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b1052-4\">Lando\u2019s research culminated in the telecast of \u201cThe Selling of Colonel Herbert\u201d on February 4,1973. That evening, the American people were presented with a fallen hero. The presentation on the air initially juxtaposed Herbert\u2019s claims and the denials of Franklin and Barnes that Herbert ever reported war crimes, and then considered in detail five aspects of the Herbert affair:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1052-5\">(1) Lando\u2019s doubts that Franklin was even present in Vietnam to hear of the St. Valentine\u2019s Day Massacre;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1052-6\">(2) Colonel Douglass\u2019s adamant denial that war crimes had been reported to him;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1052-7\">(3) Kenneth Rosenbloom\u2019s defense of the Army\u2019s investigation;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1052-8\">(4) Bruce Potter\u2019s recount of the helicopter incident; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1052-9\">(5) James Grimshaw\u2019s flat contradiction of his alleged heroism in the cave.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1052-10\">While the existence of information corroborative of Herbert\u2019s claims was alluded to on the broadcast, the program as a whole clearly cast doubt upon all of Herbert\u2019s allegations. The telecast concluded with a plea that the Army make its records public to the end of conclusively settling the imbroglio.</p>\n<p id=\"b1052-11\">Lando subsequently recounted his research in an Atlantic Monthly article titled \u201cThe Herbert Affair.\u201d The article, like the broadcast, cast serious doubts upon Herbert\u2019s veracity and concluded that the American press had been deluded by Herbert\u2019s story.</p>\n<p id=\"b1052-16\">Herbert responded to the CBS broadcast and Lando\u2019s article by instituting a defamation action against CBS, Barry Lando, Mike Wallace, the correspondent for the program, and Atlantic magazine, alleging $44,-725,000 in damages for injury to his reputation and impairment of his book \u201cSoldier\u201d as a literary property. Herbert contended that Lando deliberately distorted the record through selective investigation, \u201cskillful\u201d editing, and one-sided interviewing, and that he was deliberately depicted as evasive in the interview. In addition, Herbert claimed Atlantic republished Lando\u2019s statements knowing that they were false. Lando, Wallace and CBS countered that the publications represented a fair and accurate report of public proceedings, broadcast in good faith without malice\u00a1 and, in addition, that the program and article were protected by the First and Fourteenth Amendments.</p>\n<p id=\"b1052-17\">Once the issue was joined, Herbert commenced discovery of Lando, Wallace and CBS. The deposition of Lando required twenty-six sessions and lasted for over a year. The sheer volume of the transcript\u2014 2903 pages and 240 exhibits \u2014 is staggering. Lando answered innumerable questions about what he knew, or had seen; whom he interviewed; intimate details of his discussions with interviewees; and the form and frequency of his communications with sources.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> The exhibits produced included transcripts of his interviews; volumes of reporters notes; videotapes of interviews; and a series of drafts of the \u201c60 Minutes\u201d telecast. Herbert also discovered the contents of pre-telecast conversations between Lando and Wallace as well as reactions to documents considered by both. In fact, our close examination of the twenty-six volumes of Lando\u2019s testimony reveals a degree of helpfulness and cooperation between the parties and counsel that is to be commended in a day when procedural skirmishing is the norm. Lando, however, balked when asked a small number of questions relating to his beliefs, opinions, intent and conclusions in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"983\">*983</page-number>preparing the program.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> He claimed that any response would be inconsistent with the protections afforded the editorial process by the First Amendment. These assertedly objectionable inquiries can be grouped into five categories:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1053-5\">1.

Lando\u2019s intentions as manifested by his decision to include or exclude certain material.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1053-10\">Faced with Lando\u2019s claim that the constitution immunized his mental process from discovery, Herbert sought an order, pursuant to Rule 37(a)(2) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, compelling Lando to respond to his inquiries.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Judge Haight, after observing that the case was one of first impression, concluded that Herbert\u2019s discovery of the journalist\u2019s state of mind should be broad and unrestricted. He reasoned that a public figure bore a heavy burden of proving that an alleged libeler acted with actual malice or in reckless disregard of the truth, and that the necessarily subjective nature of the libel standard fully justified inquiry into Lando\u2019s thought processes.</p>\n<p id=\"b1053-19\">Judge Haight dismissed Lando\u2019s contention that the machinations of the editorial mind were constitutionally sacrosanct and immune from the probing of a libel plaintiff<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> The critical importance of the issue, whether the First Amendment erects any barriers to discovery of the editorial process, compelled this court to permit the instant interlocutory appeal, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(b), of the district court\u2019s order that Lando answer Herbert\u2019s inquiries.</p>\n<p id=\"b1053-20\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b1053-21\">We have undertaken this extensive review of the facts to underscore that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"984\">*984</page-number>lifeblood of the editorial process is human judgment. The journalist must constantly probe and investigate; he must formulate his views and, at every step, question his conclusions, tentative or otherwise. This is the process in which Barry Lando was engaged and his efforts suggest the nature and scope of the reporter\u2019s task in shaping and refining a mass of facts into a finished product.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1054-4\">Herbert seeks to scrutinize this very process. Of course, he has already discovered what Lando knew, saw, said and wrote during his investigation. As we noted before, the deposition of Lando produced a massive transcript documenting in minute detail the course of Lando\u2019s research. The jury is free to infer from Lando\u2019s use and application of the extensive materials discovered and, equally important, from the failure to heed certain contradictory information. If it chooses to do so (and as we have indicated in footnote 22, we express no views on the merits of the controversy), it can find that Lando acted with actual malice or in reckless disregard of the truth.</p>\n<p id=\"b1054-5\">Now, Herbert wishes to probe further and inquire into Lando\u2019s thoughts, opinions and conclusions. The answers he seeks strike to the heart of the vital human component of the editorial process. Faced with the possibility of such an inquisition, reporters and journalists would be reluctant to express their doubts. Indeed, they would be chilled in the very process of thought. As we expressed above, the tendency would be to follow the safe course of avoiding contention and controversy \u2014 the antithesis of the values fostered by the First Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1054-6\">We cannot permit inquiry into Lando\u2019s thoughts, opinions and conclusions to consume the very values which the <em>Sullivan </em>landmark decision sought to safeguard.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> It cannot be gainsaid that were a legislative body to require a journalist to justify his decisions in this matter, such an intrusion would not be condoned. That this invasion on First Amendment rights is about to be effected by an allegedly libelled plaintiff does not reduce the grave implications for the vitality of the editorial process which the Supreme Court and this court have recognized must be guarded zealously. It makes little sense to afford protection with one hand and take it away with the other. Accordingly, we remand to the district court for an evaluation of the interrogatories in light of the principles articulated in this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1045-16\">.

The restriction urged on us specifically is thaf matters of \u201ceditorial process\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> should not be discoverable at all or only under certain limitations. The exact relief requested remains somewhat unclear since appellant\u2019s brief would have us remand to the district court \u201cwith instructions for that Court to redetermine the issues raised by the motions [pursuant to Rule 37 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure], giving due regard to First Amendment considerations as set forth by this Court.\u201d Brief for Appellant at 8, 32-33. Within these broad parameters we are invited in this extraordinary though not unique interlocutory appeal on a discovery order,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> to set some limits in <em>Sullivan </em>cases on the untrammeled, roving discovery that has become so prevalent in other types of litigation in today\u2019s legal world. Not without the doubt that any venture on untrod paths may bring, I am willing to join in accepting the invitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1056-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"986\">*986</page-number>At the outset, there are familiar landmarks. There is, for example, no necessary internal inconsistency between a First Amendment limitation on compelled discovery in <em>Sullivan </em>cases on the one hand and liberal rules of civil procedure on the other.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The rules of civil procedure expressly contemplate limitations in at least two areas. First, where discovery would result in \u201coppression\u201d of or \u201cundue burden\u201d on a person whose deposition is being taken, a court may limit or even forbid discovery.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Certainly, therefore, a plaintiff\u2019s attempt to prove actual malice may be restrained where the discovery he seeks satisfies the oppression standard of Rule 26(c). And second, Rule 26(b)(1) excepts privileged matters from compelled discovery.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Not surprisingly, a privilege insulating journalists\u2019 confidential sources from compelled discovery in civil litigation has been recognized by this court and others. <em>Baker v. F &amp; F Investment, </em>470 F.2d 778 (2d Cir. 1972) (civil rights litigation), <em>cert. denied, </em>411 U.S. 966, 93 S.Ct. 2147, 36 L.Ed.2d 686 (1973); <em>Cervantes v.

Superior Court, </em>364 Mass. 317, 303 N.E.2d 847 (1973). The limitation on discovery of journalists\u2019 sources suggests by analogy that other First Amendment limitations on discovery in <em>Sullivan </em>cases may be similarly appropriate. The focus of inquiry thus becomes whether the First Amendment protects matters which constitute the editorial process from compelled discovery and, if so, the extent of that protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b1056-11\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1056-12\">I agree with the Chief Judge that compelled discovery of the editorial selection process implicates the First Amendment. \u2022 I arrive at this position not on First Amendment grounds generally but in light of what seems to be the Supreme Court\u2019s evolving recognition of the special status of the press<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> in our governmental system and the concomitant special recognition of the Free Press clause of the First Amendment. Mr. Justice Stewart, in a seminal speech at the Yale Law School, has characterized this trend as a structural, institutional differentiation between freedom of speech and freedom of press.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The trend has found expression that is both developmental and fundamental in <em>Miami Herald Publishing Co. v. Tornillo, </em>418 U.S. 241, 94 S.Ct. 2831, 41 L.Ed.2d 730 (1974).

While this notion may be appealing initially, the principle enunciated in these cases\u2014 that the editorial process of the <em>press </em>is entitled to special protection \u2014 has, I think, not just pertinent, but altogether controlling ramifications.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> As Mr. Justice Stewart has pointed out, \u201cthe Free Press guarantee is, in essence, a <em>structural </em>provision of the Constitution.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> He continues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1057-16\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"987\">*987</page-number>[Njothing in our holding allows government at any level to forbid Pittsburgh Press to publish and distribute advertisements commenting on the Ordinance, the enforcement practices of the Commission, or the propriety of sex preference in employment.

Rather it is at the core of the construct, vital to the tensile integrity of our government. <em>See New York Times Co. </em>v. <em>United States, </em>403 U.S. 713, 717, 91 S.Ct. 2140, 29 L.Ed.2d 822 (1971) (Black, J., concurring); <em>United States v. National Committee for Impeachment, </em>469 F.2d 1135, 1142 (2d Cir. 1972). To the extent that the independent exercise of editorial functions is threatened by governmental action, the very foundations of the architectural masterpiece that is our form of government are shaken, the supporting columns weakened.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1058-14\"><em>Tornillo </em>and <em>Columbia Broadcasting </em>recognize the inviolability of the editorial function. As such they reflect a keen judicial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"989\">*989</page-number>recognition of the role of the press in American society and its need for protection, a trend that has been evidenced by practically solid judicial response in favor of protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b1059-4\">The doctrine of prior restraint, prohibiting government from censoring publications in advance, is of the highest constitutional magnitude.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> This presumption<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> against the constitutional validity of prior restraints is particularly strong when the intrusion affects the communication of news or commentary on current events. See <em>Nebraska Press Association v. Stuart, </em>427 U.S. 539, 559, 96 S.Ct. 2791, 49 L.Ed.2d 683 (1976); <em>Near </em>v. <em>Minnesota ex rel. Olson, </em>283 U.S. 697, 717, 51 S.Ct. 625, 75 L.Ed. 1357 (1931).</p>\n<p id=\"b1059-10\">Further solidifying judicial recognition of the compelling institutional need for an independent press, again in a test that has been nothing less than momentous, is the decision that notwithstanding the Sixth Amendment guarantee to a fair trial by an impartial jury, judicial restraints on the publication of information concerning criminal trials will be tolerated only when less drastic methods of avoiding the effects of pretrial publicity are useless.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> <em>Nebraska </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"990\">*990</page-number><em>Press Association v. Stuart, supra, </em>427 U.S. at 562, 96 S.Ct. 2791. The Freedom of Press guarantee against governmental intrusions on the editorial process is surely at least as strong when, as here, other constitutional rights are not at stake.</p>\n<p id=\"b1060-4\">In short, the principles underlying the access and prior restraint cases apply in this situation even though the government is neither ordering the content of a publication nor directly restraining publication. The critical question is whether government is impermissibly impeding the editorial function of the press; the time<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> at which this intrusion occurs should not \u2014 it cannot \u2014matter.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Because broad discovery orders compelling disclosure of the editorial selection process can result in a chilling of \u201cthe free interchange of ideas within the news room,\u201d <em>ante </em>at 980, the \u201ccrucial process\u201d of \u201ceditorial control and judgment\u201d protected by the Freedom of Press clause. <em>Miami Herald Publishing Co. v. Tornillo, supra, </em>418 U.S. at 258, 94 S.Ct. 2831, is in as much jeopardy as if the court had restrained publication <em>ab initio. </em>For self-censorship in the future resulting from the prior judicial order is a foreseeable, perhaps a likely, result. \u201cThe special vice of a prior restraint is that communication will be suppressed, either directly or by inducing excessive caution in the speaker, before an adequate determination that it is unprotected by the First Amendment.\u201d <em>Pittsburgh Press Co. v. Pittsburgh Commission on Human Relations, </em>413 U.S. 376, 390, 93 S.Ct. 2553, 2561, 37 L.Ed.2d 669 (1973). This is a concern directed at the \u201cinstitutional viability\u201d of the press. <em>Id. </em>at 382, 93 S.Ct. 2553. Uninhibited discovery into the motivations of the editor in a libel action poses precisely the danger sought to be avoided by the landmark cases which have established the prior restraint doctrine as hornbook constitutional law. Accordingly, the principles underlying the doctrine necessitate the application of the Free Press guarantee to protect the independence of the press against such discovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b1060-7\">This is by no means the first instance in which First Amendment considerations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"991\">*991</page-number>have dictated special procedural rules.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> It is not even the first situation in which a court has held that the First Amendment extends protection in a libel case beyond the standards for liability established in <em>Sullivan </em>in order to prevent undue chilling from the litigation process itself.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1061-9\">By recognizing that <em>Tornillo </em>and <em>Columbia Broadcasting </em>require a constriction of the normal discovery rules to protect the editorial selection process of the press from compelled scrutiny, we simply add an additional procedural rule in the interest of ensuring an independent, institutional freedom of the press.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Only the level of protection remains to be determined.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1062-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"992\">*992</page-number>III</p>\n<p id=\"b1062-4\">In selecting the appropriate level of protection for the editorial process, we are faced with three theoretical possibilities. First, we might conclude as did the lower court that <em>Sullivan </em>has struck the ultimate appropriate balance so that the libel plaintiff must be permitted a level of discovery coterminous with the substantive law of constitutional libel. If so, then the plaintiff would be permitted to inquire into every aspect of the defendant\u2019s state of mind at the discovery stage with little or no inhibition. Second, we might decide that while <em>Sullivan </em>has generally struck the substantive balance, it does not preclude restraint on compelled discovery, specifically where First Amendment values are unnecessarily threatened by the nonconstitutional interest in liberal discovery. We could adapt the test developed in the disclosure of confidential source cases: evidence of the editorial process is discoverable only when it is <em>direct </em>evidence of a <em>highly </em>relevant matter which cannot otherwise be obtained.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> And finally, we might opt for the conclusion that the editorial process, is subject to constitutional privilege and that actual malice must be proved by evidence other than that obtained through compelled disclosure of matters at the heart of the editorial process.</p>\n<p id=\"b1062-10\">The answer is not free of doubt. Strict logic leading to the selection of option one has surface appeal. Approach number two seems like a reasonable compromise at first blush. But in the delicate area of precious First Amendment liberty, <em>see Baker v. F &amp; F Investment, supra, </em>470 F.2d at 785, a subtly discerning eye is necessary. Hard cases make for hard choices; vision must not only be acute, it must also be peripheral.</p>\n<p id=\"b1062-11\">The argument of strict logic \u2014 that the <em>Sullivan </em>test of knowing-or-reckless-falsity assumes open-ended discovery for the purpose of proving actual malice \u2014 is deficient in several respects. First, the <em>Sullivan </em>Court in no way indicates that it is doing anything more than setting forth substantive rules. It does not deal with the method of proving actual malice.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> Actual malice can be proved in a number of ways. Logical inferences from the inconsistency, say, between a television program\u2019s content and contrary facts which a plaintiff might independently establish would provide an obvious starting point for such proof.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"993\">*993</page-number>Moreover, a plaintiff might adduce circumstantial evidence from participants or interviewees on the television program. In this case, for example, documents furnished under the Freedom of Information Act indicate that Lando\u2019s state of mind may be provable without directly impinging on the editorial process.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> While I offer no opinion on the admissibility or adequacy of this evidence to prove actual malice, it is clear that an editor\u2019s state of mind can be examined without discovering facts at the heart of the editorial process. Limiting discovery to those matters and persons not at the heart of the editorial process does not transform the <em>Sullivan </em>rule into a nullity for putatively libeled public figures. They <em>can </em>prove actual malice without endangering the editorial process which <em>Tornillo </em>held to be protected by the First Amendment.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1063-8\">Second, the <em>Sullivan </em>balance, by permitting plaintiffs the opportunity to prove actual malice, deems a certain level of chilling-effect fallout to be consistent with the First Amendment.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> However, permitting compelled discovery of the editorial process would indubitably increase the level of chilling effect in a way ostensibly not contemplated by <em>Sullivan. </em>Thus, it is one thing to tell the press that its end product is subject to the actual malice standard and that a plaintiff is entitled to prove actual malice; it is quite another to say that the editorial process which produced the end product in question is itself discoverable. Such an inquiry chills not simply the material published but the relationship among editors. Ideas expressed in conversations, memoranda, handwritten notes and the like, if discoverable, would in the future \u201clikely\u201d<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> lead to a more muted, less vigorous <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"994\">*994</page-number>and creative give-and-take in the editorial room. This incremental chilling effect exceeds the level of chilling effect contemplated by the <em>Sullivan </em>balance.</p>\n<p id=\"b1064-4\">Finally, the fatal flaw of the strict logic position is its failure even to consider <em>Tor</em>nillo\u2019s and <em>Columbia Broadcasting\u2019s </em>ramifications. It ignores the special status which the Free Press guarantee accords to the editorial process.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1064-5\">The compromise position is similarly defective. While taking account of Tornillo\u2019s mandates, it falls short of the protection required by <em>Sullivan </em>and <em>Tornillo. </em>Admittedly, the compromise test accounts for the argument advanced above that evidence of actual malice is obtainable from sources other than compelled discovery of editors\u2019 state of mind because the compromise test itself requires that the evidence be not otherwise obtainable.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> However, the incremental chilling effect engendered by this test, while not as great as in the case of uninhibited discovery, is still significant. First, the editorial relationship may be chilled if its dynamics are subject to forced scrutiny. The knowledge that in a certain number of cases the editorial process will be discoverable is itself likely to chill that process, because no editor can visualize when a court will consider relevancy to be \u201chigh\u201d or evidence to be \u201cdirect\u201d or \u201cotherwise unobtainable.\u201d Beyond this, the compromise test is vague, difficult of application, and hence likely to be the subject of constant litigation.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> In effect, the discovery process itself, and the resulting litigation over the \u201cdirectly-related,\u201d \u201chighly-relevant\u201d and \u201cotherwise-unobtainable\u201d standards, are not merely likely to make editors more cautious, but inevitably will require them to be. The chilling effect of the compromise test is, therefore, of a greater degree than that tolerated by <em>Sullivan </em>with the gloss of <em>Tornillo </em>and <em>Columbia Broadcasting.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1064-10\">There is an additional reason for rejecting the compromise position: it developed in a very different context from that at issue here. <em>Baker v. F &amp; F Investment, supra, </em>470 F.2d at 783-84, in its discussion of <em>Garland v. Torre, </em>259 F.2d 545 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>358 U.S. 910, 79 S.Ct. 237, 3 L.Ed.2d 231 (1958), indicates that the appropriate standard for compelled disclosure of journalists\u2019 sources in civil litigation is that the evidence is closely related to the very essence of the plaintiff\u2019s case and that the information is not obtainable from other sources.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> However, in <em>Baker </em>and <em>Garland </em>very different First Amendment interests were at stake from those at issue here. In those cases, the information sought to be disclosed, whether or not vital to the plaintiff\u2019s case, was far removed from the editorial process. In this case, the plaintiffs do <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"995\">*995</page-number>not seek discovery on the periphery of the editorial process. That they have already done, as Chief Judge Kaufman notes, to the tune of 2,903 pages in deposition testimony and of 240 exhibits. Rather, plaintiffs now seek to discover the very heart of the editorial process. This they may not do consistently with Tornillo\u2019s and <em>Columbia Broadcasting\u2019s </em>solicitude for the editorial process. I, therefore, would conclude that <em>Tornillo, Columbia Broadcasting </em>and <em>Sullivan </em>mandate full protection of the editorial process from compelled disclosure. This is true because as soon as facts are set in their context there is editorial selection; as soon as that process is subject to scrutiny, there is a suppression effect; and as soon as there is such an effect, the freedom of the press has evaporated.</p>\n<p id=\"b1065-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b1065-6\">I pass then to when editorial process immunity from compelled disclosure is properly invoked. The parameters of the editorial process concept will become more definite in the context of future cases. The obvious starting point, however, is the Chief Justice\u2019s delineation in <em>Tornillo : </em>\u201c[t]he choice of material\u201d to go into the broadcast, \u201cthe decisions made\u201d on the duration and \u201ccontent\u201d of the broadcast, and \u201ctreatment of public issues and public officials \u2014 whether fair or unfair \u2014 constitute the exercise of editorial control and judgment.\u201d 418 U.S. at 258, 94 S.Ct. at 2840. Thus, <em>Tornillo </em>mandates that the mental processes of the press regarding \u201cchoice of material,\u201d duration, and \u201ccontent\u201d of the broadcast are to be protected from scrutiny.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1065-7\">At this stage of the proceedings we are not capable of determining which discovery demands fall within the editorial process privilege. I agree with the Chief Judge that at least five of the broad categories into which the district court grouped plaintiff\u2019s questions seemingly fall within the privilege. Each area of dispute relates to Lando\u2019s conclusions, opinions, intentions, or conversations concerning people or leads to be pursued, the veracity of persons interviewed, and Lando\u2019s reasons for the inclusion or exclusion of certain material. By permitting interrogation into these areas of editorial selection, the judiciary improperly intrudes upon freedom of the press just as the Florida legislature did in <em>Tornillo. </em>Whether the intrusion is judicial or legislative, the result is an unconstitutional suppression effect. There may, however, be individual questions inappropriately grouped within the protected categories. I think it is open to the district judge to determine in specific instances that Lando was not engaged in the process of editorial selection. With these caveats I concur in the general answer to the certified question and in the remand to the district court for a determination of the nature of each question in dispute.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1054-14\">. <em>See Restatement (Second) of Torts, </em>Special Note at 3 (Tent.

City of Chicago, </em>365 U.S. 43, 53, 81 S.Ct. 391, 5 L.Ed.2d 403 (1961) (Warren, C. J., dissenting). The precise parameters of the prior restraint doctrine have never been delineated. <em>Near v. Minnesota ex rel. Olson, </em>283 U.S. 697, 51 S.Ct. 625, 75 L.Ed. 1357 (1931), expanded the classic English definition of prohibiting publication without advance approval of the government to preclude an injunction against publication of malicious and scandalous matter enforced by a <em>subsequent </em>contempt order. The later threat of an injunction was viewed as a prior restraint; while the metaphor of \u201cchilling effect\u201d had not yet been devised it was already operational. The broad scope of the doctrine is apparent from the holding in <em>Grosjean v. American Press Co., </em>297 U.S. 233, 56 S.Ct. 444, 80 L.Ed. 660 (1936), where a tax imposed on newspapers publishing advertisements and measured by the amount of circulation was found to be an unconstitutional prior restraint because the tax lowered advertising revenues and restricted circulation. <em>Id. </em>at 244-45, 56 S.Ct. 444. Justice Sutherland explained the scope of the prior restraint doctrine as enunciated in <em>Near:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1059-7\">The conclusion there stated is that the object of the constitutional provisions was to prevent previous restraints on publication; and the court was careful not to limit the protection of the right to any particular way of abridging it. .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1059-8\">Judge Cooley has laid dotvn the test to be applied \u2014 \u201cThe evils to be prevented were not the censorship of the press merely, but any action of the government by means of which it might prevent such free and general discussion of public matters as seems absolutely essential to prepare the people for an intelligent exercise of their rights as citizens.\u201d 2 Cooley\u2019s Constitutional Limitations, 8th ed., p. 886.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1059-13\"><em>Id. </em>at 249-50, 56 S.Ct. at 449.</p>\n<p id=\"b1059-14\">The broad discovery order in this case operates <em>after </em>publication to deter free editorial choice concerning <em>subsequent </em>publications. Because the order operates as a prior restraint, as did the tax in <em>Grosjean, </em>it should be presumed invalid. <em>See </em>T. Emerson, <em>The System of Freedom of Expression </em>503-12 (1970). Furthermore, the order impinges on the most sensitive functions of the press, the motivations behind and thought processes involved in editorial decisions; thus, the presumption should be given all the more force. The prior restraint cases, as well as <em>Tornillo </em>and <em>Columbia Broadcasting, </em>appear to be directed against the danger of self-censorship by the press arising from concern with subsequent executive, legislative or judicial scrutiny. It is the protection these cases afford that truly gives rise to the concept of the press as a Fourth Estate, coequal in our democratic republic in constitutional respect, even though not incorporated formally into our governmental system as a structuralized entity.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b1059-15\">. <em>New York Times Co. v.

As Mr. Justice Black explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1061-13\">\u201cMalice,\u201d even as defined by the Court, is an elusive, abstract concept, hard to prove and hard to disprove.

This does not mean that the chilling effect in the editorial room would be concomitantly reduced. The fear of such discovery and of the full scale utilization of the litigation process as permitted by the compromise test is likely to stifle the flow of ideas in the editorial room.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"36\">\n<p id=\"b1064-12\">. <em>See New York Times Co. v.

In this action, Anthony Herbert alleges that he has been libeled by Barry Lando, Mike Wallace, C.B.S. and Atlantic Monthly. Under <em>New York Times v. Sullivan, </em>376 U.S. 254, 84 S.Ct. 710, 11 L.Ed.2d 686 (1964), he may prevail if he proves that the defendants acted with \u201cactual malice,\u201d that is, knowing or reckless disregard of the truth. The major purpose of this lawsuit, therefore, is to expose the defendants\u2019 subjective state of mind \u2014 their thoughts, beliefs, opinions, intentions, motives and conclusions \u2014 to the light of judicial review. Obviously, such a review has a \u201cchilling\u201d or deterrent effect. It is supposed to. The publication of lies should be discouraged. The discovery by a libel plaintiff of an editor\u2019s state of mind will not chill First Amendment activity to any greater extent than it is already being <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"996\">*996</page-number>chilled as a result of the very review permitted by <em>New York Times v. Sullivan. </em>The majority\u2019s attempt to eliminate or reduce that chill is supportable in neither precedent nor logic.</p>\n<p id=\"b1066-4\">The plaintiff in a libel action bears the heavy burden of proving actual malice by clear and convincing proof. The notion that a plaintiff carrying such a burden should be denied the right to ask what the defendant\u2019s mental state was is remarkable on its face. In my view Judge Haight was quite right to apply the normal rules of discovery and to permit inquiry into the defendants\u2019 mental state.</p>\n<p id=\"b1066-5\">Chief Judge Kaufman finds a basis for creating a new editorial privilege in \u201cthe privilege established by <em>Branzburg [v. Hayes, </em>408 U.S. 665, 92 S.Ct. 2646, 33 L.Ed.2d 626 (1972)],\u201d <em>ante </em>at 227, and in the Supreme Court\u2019s decisions in <em>Miami Herald Publishing Co. v. Tornillo, </em>418 U.S. 241, 94 S.Ct. 2831, 41 L.Ed.2d 730 (1974) (right of reply statute), and <em>C.B.S., Inc. v. Democratic National Committee, </em>412 U.S. 94, 93 S.Ct. 2080, 36 L.Ed.2d 772 (1973) (editorial advertising), which deal generally with the protections afforded to \u201cthe exercise of editorial control and judgment.\u201d 418 U.S. at 258, 94 S.Ct. at 2840. By combining the <em>Branzburg </em>privilege with the <em>Tornillo </em>and <em>C.B.S. </em>protections for editing, the Chief Judge creates an editorial privilege. Judge Oakes adopts a somewhat different approach. He too relies on <em>Branzburg, Tornillo </em>and <em>C.B.S., </em>but he goes further and, relying primarily on a speech given by Mr. Justice Stewart at the Yale Law School, extracts from the free press clause a doctrine which appears to convert the fourth estate into an institution not unlike an unofficial fourth branch of government. This fourth branch is' given a special privilege presumably for the same reasons that the three official branches are given executive, congressional and judicial privileges.</p>\n<p id=\"b1066-6\">I find neither approach persuasive. Contrary to the suggestions of my colleagues, there is presently no constitutional privilege against disclosure of a journalist\u2019s confidential sources, either in the criminal context, <em>Branzburg v. Hayes, supra, </em>or in the civil context, <em>Garland v. Torre, </em>259 F.2d 545 (2d Cir.) (Stewart, <em>J.) </em>(libel action), <em>cert. denied, </em>358 U.S. 910, 79 S.Ct. 237, 3 L.Ed.2d 231 (1958). <em>Baker v. F &amp; F Investment, </em>470 F.2d 778 (2d Cir. 1972), <em>cert. denied, </em>411 U.S. 966, 93 S.Ct. 2147, 36 L.Ed.2d 686 (1973), which is cited by the majority as supporting such a privilege, merely held that a district judge in a civil case did not abuse his discretion in denying a motion to compel a non-party journalist to disclose the identity of a confidential news source where the identity of the source was of questionable materiality to the plaintiff\u2019s cause of action and could be obtained by other means. The Court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ABd\">Although it is safe to conclude, particularly after the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Branzburg . . </em>. that federal law does not recognize an absolute or conditional journalist\u2019s testimonial \u201cprivilege\u201d, neither does federal law require disclosure of confidential sources in each and every case, both civil and criminal, in which the issue is raised.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1066-9\">470 F.2d at 781. The decision stands for the proposition, with which I wholeheartedly agree, that the public interest reflected in the First Amendment and in State \u201cnewsman\u2019s privilege\u201d statutes is entitled to be considered when a district judge exercises discretion with regard to discovery matters. The decision recognized no privilege. In view of <em>Branzburg </em>and <em>Garland </em>it could not have. <em>See also Caldero </em>v. <em>Tribune Publishing Co., </em>98 Idaho 288, 562 P.2d 791, <em>cert. </em>denied, - U.S. -, 98 S.Ct. 418, 54 L.Ed.2d 291 (1977); <em>Carey v. Hume, </em>160 U.S.App.D.C. 365, 492 F.2d 631, <em>cert. dismissed, </em>417 U.S. 938, 94 S.Ct. 2654, 41 L.Ed.2d 661 (1974). Thus, to the extent that the majority relies on \u201cthe privilege established by <em>Branzburg\u201d </em>and its elaboration in <em>Baker, </em>today\u2019s decision is without precedential foundation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1066-12\">The <em>Tornillo </em>and <em>C.B.S. </em>decisions also provide little support for the privilege created by the majority. Those cases establish that when the government tries to control what is published or broadcast the courts may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"997\">*997</page-number>find an unconstitutional \u201cintrusion into the function of editors.\u201d 418 U.S. at 258, 94 S.Ct. at 2839. Neither decision supports the unqualified \u201cproposition that the First Amendment will not tolerate intrusion into the decisionmaking function of editors.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 987 (Oakes, <em>J., </em>concurring). Some intrusions, such as those which occur when the press is required to publish or broadcast views with which it disagrees, are prohibited. Other intrusions, such as the intrusion inherent in all libel actions, are permitted. <em>See generally Branzburg v. Hayes, supra, </em>408 U.S. at 681-85, 92 S.Ct. 2646. The intrusion against which the majority seeks to protect editors is the chilling effect that \u201cjudicial review of the editor\u2019s thought processes,\u201d <em>ante </em>at 980, will have on the \u201cexercise of editorial judgment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 980; 990-991 (Oakes, <em>J., </em>concurring). After <em>New York Times v. Sullivan, </em>however, judicial review of the editor\u2019s thought process is what a libel action is all about. The mere existence of a libel cause of action chills the exercise of editorial judgment. That is the whole idea. It is exactly this kind of chill that <em>New York Times v. Sullivan </em>condones.</p>\n<p id=\"b1067-7\">Judge Oakes\u2019 argument based on the \u201cstructural or institutional aspect of the Free Press guarantee,\u201d <em>ante </em>at 988, is troubling for two reasons. First, I doubt whether it can be considered to add anything to the Chief Judge\u2019s arguments based on <em>Branzburg, Tornillo </em>and <em>C.B.S. </em>Second, before the Court can recognize any special, preferred position for the press as an institution, it must necessarily recognize a distinction between personal rights on the one hand and institutional rights on the other. \u201cFreedom of the press is a \u2018fundamental personal right\u2019 \u201d which encompasses \u201cthe right of the lonely pamphleteer who uses carbon paper or a mimeograph\u201d as well as that of \u201cthe large metropolitan publisher who utilizes the latest photocomposition methods.\u201d <em>Branzburg v. Hayes, supra, </em>408 U.S. at 704, 92 S.Ct. at 2668, <em>quoting, Lovell v. Griffin, </em>303 U.S. 444, 450, 58 S.Ct. 666, 82 L.Ed. 1242 (1938). If we distinguish between institutional and personal rights to liberty of the press and place the former in a preferred position, then we necessarily place the latter in a subordinate position. The First Amendment interest of the public in having access to the truth is not necessarily better served by an institution than an individual. I would recognize such a distinction only with the greatest reluctance, and I would certainly not do so on the basis of a single speech, even one given by Mr. Justice Stewart. <em>Compare Saxbe v. Washington Post Co., </em>417 U.S. 843, 94 S.Ct. 2811, 41 L.Ed.2d 514 (1974), in which the Supreme Court, per Mr. Justice Stewart, held that journalists have no special access to information not available to the public generally.</p>\n<p id=\"b1067-9\">It makes no sense at all for us to construct a privilege designed to eliminate or reduce a chill on expressive activity which is already generated by the libel action itself. I do recognize, however, that some of the discovery sought by Herbert, particularly the conversations sought in the fourth of the five categories of assertedly objectionable inquiries, <em>ante </em>at 983, has a potential for what Judge Oakes refers to as an \u201cincremental\u201d chilling effect, <em>ante </em>at 993-994, over and above that contemplated by <em>New York Times v. Sullivan. </em>The discovery of communications between editors and journalists, as distinguished from subjective mental states, may well have the effect of inhibiting \u201cthe free interchange of ideas within the news room.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 980, 990 (Oakes, <em>J., </em>concurring). If the press were forced to disclose all of the ideas and theories that are explored during the editorial process, then intellectual exploration itself would be discouraged \u2014 without necessarily, or even probably, deterring irresponsible journalism. By thus discouraging \u201cthe creative verbal testing, probing, and discussion of hypotheses and alternatives which are the <em>sine qua non </em>of responsible journalism,\u201d <em>ante </em>at 980; <em>see </em>993-994 (Oakes, J., concurring), discovery of the communications sought under category four could have an incremental chilling effect not built into the <em>New York Times v. Sullivan </em>libel action. The operation of this incremental chill is actually rather conven<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"998\">*998</page-number>tional in nature. It is the same sort of chill that forms the basis for most privileges: a chill on the expression of ideas or the communication of information in the context of certain special, lawful, confidential relationships. However, a moment\u2019s reflection will reveal that a privilege sufficient to eliminate this incremental chill would have to be exceedingly broad. All confidential communications, whether oral or written and whether made in the newsroom or elsewhere, would have to be covered. It seems to me that if such a privilege were really necessary to protect the editorial function, we would have heard about it long before now. Like the Supreme Court in <em>Branzburg, </em>I would be \u201cunwilling to embark the judiciary on a long and difficult journey to such an uncertain destination.\u201d 408 U.S. at 703, 92 S.Ct. at 2668. The Supreme Court has shown no enthusiasm for the creation of new constitutional privileges, particularly where, as here, they are based on claims of chilling effect that depend on the imaginations of judges rather than proof supplied by the parties. <em>Compare Branzburg </em>v. <em>Hayes, supra, </em>408 U.S. at 693-95, 92 S.Ct. 2646, <em>with N.A.A.C.P. v. Alabama ex rel. Patterson, </em>357 U.S. 449, 462, 78 S.Ct. 1163, 2 L.Ed.2d 1488 (1958) (in support of its claim of a privilege against disclosure of the identity of its rank-and-file membership, the NAACP made an \u201cuncontroverted showing\u201d that exposure had in the past led to harassment of its membership).</p>\n<p id=\"b1068-4\">I would affirm Judge Haight\u2019s order compelling discovery.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
