Industries, Inc. (MSP), seeks review and modification of an order of the National Labor Relations Board, reported at 222 NLRB No. 29, which found MSP had committed unfair labor practices within the meaning of \u00a7\u00a7 8(a)(1) and (3) of the National Labor Relations Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 158(a)(1) and (3) (1970) (interfering with, restraining or coercing employees in the exercise of rights guaranteed by \u00a7 7 of the Act; discrimination in regard to hire, tenure or any term or condition of employment to encourage or discourage union membership). The Board ordered MSP to offer reinstatement to two discharged employees and awarded those employees, as well as three others, back pay. It also ordered MSP to cease and desist from the unlawful practices and to post the usual notices.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">Graphic Arts International Union, Local No. 276, AFL-CIO (the Union), intervened with respect to MSP\u2019s petition and also cross-petitioned for review of that part of the Board\u2019s decision which declined to issue an order requiring MSP to bargain with the Union. The Board filed a cross-application for enforcement of its order pursuant to \u00a7 10(e) of the Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 160(e) (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b239-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b239-8\">\n<em>The Factual Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b239-9\">MSP, a Colorado corporation, maintains its place of business in Denver, Colorado, where it is engaged in general commercial printing as \u201cThe Larimer Press.\u201d MSP\u2019s highest managerial official is Ray Scott who operates as an advisor to the Board of Directors, but has no official title. (R. 25). Roger Johnson, the general manager, reports directly to Scott. Benjamin Ewing is the plant superintendent. It is conceded that all these persons were supervisors within the meaning of Section 2(11) of the Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 152(11) (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b239-10\">MSP\u2019s production operations are organized into departments. Copy delivered by a customer is processed into a \u201ccamera-ready\u201d form in the Art Department. From the Art Department work proceeds to the Preparatory Department which has three basic functions: first, negatives are produced by the camera; second, the negatives are \u201cstripped\u201d into proper position on a mask; third, the negatives are used in the preparation of plates for use on the presses. These plates are then taken to the Press Department where they are put on one of the company\u2019s five presses to produce the desired numbers of the printed product. Printed materials are then sent to the Bindery and Delivery Department where production is completed and the finished product delivered to the customer.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-13\">The facts stated above are undisputed. In our discussion which follows some of the facts are in sharp dispute. We state them as found by the administrative law judge and the Board or as indicated by some record evidence tending to support the findings. We note the major conflicts in the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-14\">The Union filed a representation petition on September 17, 1974, and on October 15, 1974, the parties entered into a Stipulation for Certification upon Consent Election, with the election scheduled for November 15, 1974. Thereafter, MSP held a series of preelection meetings with its employees during which Scott or Johnson told the employees that there had never been a layoff or a reduction in hours of work at MSP, even when production work was not available.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On November 7, a week before the election, Scott sent a letter to the company\u2019s employees in which he re-emphasized MSP\u2019s no-layoff policy (R. 40-41):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b239-15\">Your work at the Larimer Press is steady. There has NEVER been a layoff in the history of the Company \u2014 over 7 years! Ask any member of the Union whether they have been kept on the payroll full time. When we have been short of work in the plant, rather than lay off, pressmen have worked in the bindery, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>employees from all departments have been given fill work \u2014 sometimes painting, etc., so they would receive a full week\u2019s pay at no reduction in their regular rate of pay! <em>The union will not permit this!</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b240-4\">(R. 1693, G.C.Ex. 24) (Emphasis in original). Scott reaffirmed this no-layoff policy in various discussions with individual employees prior to the election. (R. 110-11, 562-63).</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">The election was held at the company between 4:00 and 5:00 p. m. on November 15. There were 15 votes in favor of the Union and 6 against, with 8 ballots challenged.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> (R. 16-17). Shortly after the election was over and the results announced, at about 5:15 or 5:30 p. m. the same day, Scott called a meeting of the company\u2019s management and decided<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> to lay off some employees on Monday, November 18. (R. 1008, 1037).</p>\n<p id=\"b240-6\">On Monday morning, the first regular working day after the election, Scott, accompanied by Johnson and Ewing, ordered each employee arriving at work to proceed directly to the employee\u2019s work station. (R. 302, 530, 565).</p>\n<p id=\"b240-7\">Soon afterwards, Scott, Johnson and Ewing went to each work station where Scott, using a document prepared by Johnson after the election, told each employee that: (1) they would not be permitted to leave their work stations, except in connection with their duties; (2) they were not to engage in personal conversation among themselves unrelated to their work; (3) they would be required to eat their lunches in the company lunchroom; (4) the lunch period would thereafter be staggered; (5) they would be required to punch out on completing the last job of the day and call in each day to ascertain whether there would be work for them the following day; and (6) the company was discontinuing its policy of providing free coffee for employees.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Scott also said that violation of any of these rules would subject the employee to dismissal. After this announcement Scott and Ewing placed Gonzalo Botello, John Filben, Henry Erlacher, Rafael Gonzalez and Rodney Olguin on an intermittent layoff status, stating that they would be notified or should call in to find out when work was available.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-13\">Botello, a stripper in the Preparatory Department, was informed by Ewing that he was being \u201ctemporarily laid off.\u201d (R. 386). Since Botello did not have a telephone at this time, Ewing instructed him to call in each day to see whether there was work for him. Botello testified that in a conversation with Scott later in the day, Botello was told: \u201c. . . you brought this upon yourself.\u201d (R. 387); that when Botello asked how he had done this, Scott responded: \u201cYou voted for the Union.\u201d (R. 387); that Botello denied voting for the Union but Scott stated that he didn\u2019t believe him. (R. 387). Scott contradicted this testimony.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Botello remained out of work until <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>November 21. He worked 16 hours in the week ending November 29 but was permanently laid off on December 2. (R. 388). On February 7,1975, Johnson called Botello to offer him work but he declined the offer. (R. 389-90).</p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">Filben, the company\u2019s only platemaker, was told to confine his work exclusively to platemaking, even though normally he also performed other tasks. He was also told to punch out when there was no such work to be done. (R. 114-15). Filben continued working part-time from November 18 to December 2, when Ewing notified him that MSP had no further need for a full-time platemaker and that his job was being eliminated. (R. 118-19).</p>\n<p id=\"b241-6\">Erlacher, MSP\u2019s only cameraman, was escorted by Scott to his work station when he reported for work and was ordered not to leave the work area and to refrain from conversations with other employees on pain of discharge. (R. 242-43). About an hour and a half later, Ewing ordered Erlacher to clock out and told him to call the plant every evening thereafter to ascertain whether there would be work for him the following day. Between November 18,1974 and late February, 1975, Erlacher worked intermittently for the company. (R. 1652, G.C.Ex. 10). Since February 18, 1975, by arrangement with Johnson, Erlacher has not been required to call in on a daily basis and has been working at least forty hours a week. (R. 261).</p>\n<p id=\"b241-7\">When Gonzalez, a stripper, reported for work on the evening shift on November 18, Ewing told him that the night shift had been eliminated and that he should return to work the next day on the day shift. (R. 420-21). Meanwhile, another stripper who had previously tendered his resignation changed his mind. When Gonzalez reported for work on November 19 as ordered, Ewing informed him that there was no work for him since the other stripper was not leaving. (R. 421). Ewing did suggest that he call in each evening to inquire whether work would be available for him the following day. Gonzalez complied with this request but it was not until the first week of February, 1975, that Johnson told him that there was work available. (R. 42A-26).</p>\n<p id=\"b241-11\">During the morning of November 18, Olguin, a pressman, told Ewing that the announcement by Scott was \u201call wrong\u201d. A few minutes later, Scott approached Olguin and asked him what was wrong with the working conditions and asked Olguin: \u201cwhy did they vote the union in?\u201d. (R. 305-06). Olguin insisted that the changes in the working conditions were wrong and suggested that the Union won the election \u201cmaybe because the people wanted more money.\u201d (R. 305-06). Olguin testified that Scott then cited some examples of the company\u2019s wage levels and told Olguin: \u201cDo you know that your wages aren\u2019t going up \u2014 that they\u2019re going down?\u201d (R. 306); that when Olguin asked Scott if that was a threat, Scott replied: \u201cNo, but your wages aren't going up \u2014 they\u2019re going down\u201d (R. 306); and that Scott then asked Olguin: \u201cDo you think I\u2019ll negotiate with the Union?\u201d (R. 306); and that when Olguin replied: \u201cProbably not,\u201d Scott said: \u201cRight.\u201d (R. 306). Scott denied these statements.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b241-12\">On December 3 Ewing notified Olguin that he was being laid off for lack of work and that the company intended to use other personnel to operate his press. (R. 310). He worked approximately 15 hours a week in December, somewhat less in January, 1975, not at all from January 25 to February 22, 1975, and intermittently from that time to the date of the hearing. (R. 1675-78; G.C.Ex. 17).</p>\n<p id=\"b241-13\">All of these laid off employees<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> had attended the company\u2019s preelection meetings <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>and Filben, Erlacher and Olguin had spoken out at the meetings. Further, in a letter from the Union to all employees dated November 20, 1974, Filben, Erlacher and Olguin were named along with three other employees as members of the Union Committee which was to represent the Union in its negotiations with MSP. Scott admitted seeing a copy of this letter on his desk, but he testified that it first came to his attention on December 3 or 4, after the layoffs of Filben and Olguin. (R. 783).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b242-4\">On the basis of such evidence, the Board found that MSP had violated \u00a7 8(a)(1) of the Act by certain statements of Scott to the employees during the preelection campaign and after the election and by instituting changes in the working conditions of its employees on November 18, 1974.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The Board also found that MSP had violated \u00a7\u00a7 8(a)(1) and (3) by reducing the hours of employees Filben, Erlacher, Olguin, Botello and Gonzalez; by requiring them to call in on a daily basis to determine if work was available for them; by laying these men off and discharging Filben because of their Union activities; and by refusing to grant a wage increase to another employee, Douglas Halter, because of his union activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">The Board\u2019s order required MSP to cease and desist from the unfair labor practices found and to post the usual notices. It also ordered MSP to offer immediate and full reinstatement to employees Filben and Olguin and to make them, as well as Erlacher, Botello and Gonzalez, whole for any loss of earnings they may have suffered as a result of the discrimination against them. The Board refused to issue a bargaining order because it concluded that such an order, although otherwise justified by MSP\u2019s unfair labor practices, was not warranted since the Union had won the election and had been certified by the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-13\">MSP\u2019s petition challenges the Board\u2019s findings with respect to the reduction in hours and layoffs of the five employees and the denial of a wage increase to Halter and attacks the propriety of the reinstatement and back pay provisions in the order. The Union\u2019s petition is concerned with the Board\u2019s refusal to grant a bargaining order. The Board argues in support of its findings and asks enforcement of its order.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-14\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b242-15\"><em>Review of the Board\u2019s findings of unfair labor </em>practices<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b242-16\">The administrative law judge found that MSP:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-17\">. changed its policy of avoiding layoffs by providing make-work tasks, and resorted to reduction in hours of work, call-in requirements and layoffs, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>whole or substantial part, in retaliation against its employees for designating the Union as their bargaining agent. (Decision, 33-34; R. 2323-24).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">MSP essentially argues that this finding, adopted by the Board, is erroneous because (1) the Board applied an incorrect legal standard in evaluating MSP\u2019s defense of economic necessity, and (2) the finding is not supported by substantial evidence. We cannot agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b243-7\">I. <em>MSP\u2019s defense of economic necessity</em></p>\n<p id=\"b243-8\">In the hearings before the administrative law judge, MSP argued that the layoffs and reduction in hours policy instituted on November 18 were the result of economic necessity. The crux of petitioner\u2019s defense was that during the three months prior to the discharges the company had suffered net operating losses even though its net sales were increasing and were the highest in the company\u2019s history in October of 1974. MSP attributed this declining profitability to a relatively large increase in the number of its employees during this period.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-9\">The judge addressed MSP's contentions as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-10\">While the statistical data introduced by respondent may not be conclusive, the evidence is sufficient to warrant a finding that Respondent\u2019s action may have been economically justified. The issue, however, is whether, in changing its long-established policy of retaining employees during slack periods by assigning them to make-work tasks, Respondent was motivated solely by reason of economic necessity or, in whole or material part, by a purpose to retaliate against the employees for electing the Union as their bargaining agent. (Decision, 31; R. 2320).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b243-12\">The judge went on to find that MSP had been motivated, in whole or substantial part, by a purpose to retaliate against its employees for designating the Union as their bargaining agent, in disregard of MSP\u2019s exhortations and admonitions. (Decision, 34-35; R. 2323-24).</p>\n<p id=\"b243-13\">MSP argues that the administrative law judge and the Board erred in treatment of the economic necessity defense,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> that the effect of the Board\u2019s decision is to hold that once union organizational activity has commenced, an employer has lost in perpetuity the right to respond to economic compulsion, and that the ruling runs counter to several cases dealing with such a defense, citing <em>inter alia, Bill\u2019s Coal Co. </em>v. <em>NLRB, </em>493 F.2d 243 (10th Cir.); <em>NLRB v. Beech Aircraft Corp., </em>483 F.2d 51 (10th Cir.); and <em>Cain\u2019s Coffee Co. v. NLRB, </em>404 F.2d 1172 (10th Cir.). (Brief for Petitioner, 21-24, <em>et </em>seq.) Relying on <em>Beech Aircraft, </em>MSP says that where a business justification for a layoff is established, the fact that the employer welcomed the opportunity to lay off a particular employee does not make the layoff discriminatory or unlawful. (Id. at 24).</p>\n<p id=\"b243-14\">Essentially MSP's argument is that if an economic justification is established, it constitutes a <em>per se </em>defense to such a charge by the Board, despite a showing of unfair labor practices. We feel that proof of a business justification does not have such an immunizing effect. Instead, when the employer has come forward with evidence of a legitimate motive for a dismissal, the effect is then to make it incumbent on the General Counsel to demonstrate explicitly that an improper motive \u201ccontributed to the discharge.\u201d <em>Cain\u2019s Coffee Co. v. NLRB, supra, </em>404 F.2d at 1175-76. If it is established that an unlawful discrimination against those active in union affairs was a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>partial motive for a discharge, there is a violation. <em>NLRB v. Montgomery Ward &amp; Co., </em>554 F.2d 996, 1002 (10th Cir.); <em>S. </em>A. <em>Healy Co. v. NLRB, </em>435 F.2d 314, 316 (10th Cir.); <em>Betts Baking Co. </em>v. <em>NLRB, </em>380 F.2d 199, 203 (10th Cir.).</p>\n<p id=\"b244-4\">MSP says that the Board and the Union rely on the untenable proposition that \u201cany indication\u201d of anti-union animus is sufficient for a finding of a violation. (Reply Brief of Petitioner, 6). We do not feel that .the opinions of the Board and the administrative law judge evince such a view. The judge\u2019s view, implicitly adopted by the Board, was that the question is whether:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-5\">. in changing its long-established policy of retaining employees during slack periods by assigning them to make-work tasks, Respondent was motivated solely by reason of economic necessity or, <em>in whole or material part, </em>by a purpose to retaliate against the employees for electing the Union as their bargaining agent. (Decision, 31; R. 2320) (Emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">We feel that the test applied \u2014 whether there was improper motivation \u201cin whole or material part\u201d \u2014 is proper and not unreasonable. See <em>NLRB </em>v. <em>Associated Naval Architects, Inc., </em>355 F.2d 788, 792 (4th Cir.).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b244-7\">Cases such as <em>Bill\u2019s Coal Co., Inc. </em>v. <em>NLRB, supra, </em>493 F.2d 243, <em>NLRB v. Beech Aircraft Corp., supra, </em>483 F.2d 51, and <em>Cain\u2019s Coffee Co. </em>v. <em>NLRB, supra, </em>404 F.2d 1172, do not support MSP\u2019s position or call for rejection of the test applied by the administrative law judge. In <em>Bill\u2019s Coal Co., </em>where an economic justification for layoffs was demonstrated, we rejected the evidence that the discharges were discriminatory and said the circumstances must do more than create just a suspicion or surmise of discrimination and must amount to substantial evidence from which an inference of discrimination may be drawn. 493 F.2d at 247. In that case we examined the evidence as to whether a discriminatory layoff was established and did not treat the admitted economic justification as a <em>per se </em>defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-10\">MSP also relies on <em>Cain\u2019s Coffee Co. v. NLRB, supra, </em>404 F.2d 1172, as supporting its position on its economic justification defense. However, there we stated (id. at 1175-76):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-11\">. when the employer has come forward with evidence to establish a legitimate motive for the dismissal, <em>it is incumbent upon the General Counsel to then explicitly demonstrate that an improper motivation contributed to the discharge. Failing this, </em>the presence of legitimate business reasons underlying the dismissal is sufficient to preclude a finding of discrimination. (Emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AXe\">Again the showing of an economic justification was not treated as conclusive, but as making it incumbent on the General Counsel to demonstrate that the improper motivation \u201ccontributed to the discharge.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b244-12\"><em>NLRB v. Beech Aircraft Corp., supra, </em>483 F.2d 51, probably comes closer to supporting MSP\u2019s position than the other cases. There, in a case of undisputed economic necessity of a layoff, we said that if the discharge made was required by the seniority rule it simply could not be found that it resulted from displeasure over the employee\u2019s union activities, and the fact that Beech welcomed the opportunity to discharge the employee did not make the layoff discriminatory or unlawful. Id. at 55. However, \u201cwelcoming\u201d the opportunity to discharge an employee and being motivated in whole or substantial part by a discriminatory purpose, as was found here, are not the same. Moreover, these circumstances in the <em>Beech </em>case are not easily compared to those of MSP where there was a history of avoiding layoffs by the policy of assigning workers to make-work tasks <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>during slack periods,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> and where it was found that this policy was changed, in whole or substantial part, in retaliation against the employees for designating the Union as their bargaining agent.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-6\">In sum, we see no error in the test applied by the administrative law judge and the Board, namely, whether the employer was motivated in the change of policy solely by economic necessity or, in whole or material part, by a purpose to retaliate against the employees for electing the Union as their bargaining agent.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-7\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b245-8\">\n<em>The sufficiency of the evidence to support the Board\u2019s findings</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b245-9\">This brings us to the question whether the Board\u2019s findings against MSP are supported by substantial evidence as contained in the record in its entirety. <em>Universal Camera Corp. v. NLRB, </em>340 U.S. 474, 488, 71 S.Ct. 456, 95 L.Ed. 456.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-10\">1. <em>The layoffs of Filben, Erlacher and Olguin</em></p>\n<p id=\"b245-11\">MSP principally relies upon a defense of economic necessity to justify the layoffs of employees Filben, Erlacher and Olguin. As we have noted, the Board accepted the view of the administrative law judge that the evidence was sufficient to warrant a finding that MSP\u2019s action may have been economically justified. However, after weighing all the evidence the judge concluded, in findings adopted by the Board, that MSP \u201cchanged its policy of avoiding layoffs by providing make-work tasks, and resorted to reduction in hours of work, call-in requirements and layoffs, in whole or substantial part, in retaliation against its employees by designating the Union as their bargaining agent, in disregard of Respondent\u2019s exhortations and admonitions.\u201d (R. 2323-24).</p>\n<p id=\"AU\">The company\u2019s no-layoff policy was clearly established in the record, and this policy was repeatedly stressed to the employees during the pre-election period. Despite this policy, once the results of the election were announced an immediate decision was made to layoff employees and to institute reductions in hours for some employees. (R. 1008, 1037)<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b245-16\">Furthermore, the Board\u2019s characterization of the layoffs as retaliation for union activities is also amply supported in the record. For example, Filben, Erlacher and Olguin were known union supporters and had attended and spoken out at the company\u2019s pre-election meetings. At one such meeting, Filben challenged Scott\u2019s explanation of MSP\u2019s profit sharing plan and gave his own version of it to assembled employees. At another, Erlacher commented that MSP pressroom conditions were unacceptable and would not have been tolerated in his native Germany. Additionally, after the election but prior to December 2, 1974, Filben, Erlacher and Olguin were named in a letter from the Union to all employees as members of the union committee which was to represent the Union in its negotiations with MSP. (R. 1626). The administrative law judge concluded that it was \u201chighly improbable\u201d that this letter could have escaped the company\u2019s attention. (R. 2301).</p>\n<p id=\"b245-17\">When the change in lay-off policy, the timing of the layoffs, the outspoken union support of Filben, Erlacher and Olguin, and the coercive statements by MSP management are weighed together, there is substantial support for the Board\u2019s findings. MSP\u2019s challenge to these findings and its argument that selection of employees for layoff was made in a non-discriminatory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>manner and in a company-wide action<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> do not persuade us that the finding as to these employees was error.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-4\">2. <em>The layoffs of Botello and Gonzalez</em></p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">MSP argues that the Board\u2019s conclusion that employees Botello and Gonzalez were laid off for discriminatory reasons is unsupported since the record contains no evidence linking Botello and Gonzalez with the Union or showing that MSP\u2019s supervisory personnel were aware of any union activities on their part.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-6\">It is true that generally an employer\u2019s knowledge of his employee\u2019s union activity is a prerequisite to establishment of a discriminatory layoff or discharge. <em>Bill\u2019s Coal Co., Inc. v. NLRB, supra, </em>493 F.2d at 246-47. However, circumstances may be such that a violation can be shown without proof of the employer\u2019s awareness of the opinions of individual employees. For instance, a power display in the form of a mass layoff, where made for an unlawful purpose to discourage union membership, may establish a violation \u201ceven if some white sheep suffer along with the black.\u201d <em>Majestic Molded Products Inc. </em>v. <em>NLRB, </em>330 F.2d 603, 606 (2d Cir.); see also <em>NLRB v. Brown-Dunkin Co., </em>287 F.2d 17, 19, 20 (10th Cir.).</p>\n<p id=\"b246-7\">A finding based on reasoning similar to that in the <em>Majestic Molded Products </em>case was made here by the administrative law judge and adopted by the Board without comment. (See note 15, <em>supra). </em>In view of that finding and the substantial evidence of anti-union animus already discussed, we are satisfied that the findings with respect to Botello<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> and Gonzalez are amply supported.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-10\">3. <em>The denial of a wage increase to Douglas Halter</em></p>\n<p id=\"b246-11\">The administrative law judge found that MSP \u201chad not discriminated in regard to the hire and tenure of employment of Douglas Halter.\u201d (R. 2329). The Board partially reversed this finding and found that Halter had been discriminatorily denied a wage increase on or about the end of November, 1974, in violation of \u00a7\u00a7 8(a)(1) and (3). MSP argues that the Board\u2019s conclusion is not supported by substantial evidence. We must agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-12\">Halter, a typesetter by vocation, was hired on October 31, 1974, to work in the bindery at a starting rate of $4.25 an hour. Halter testified that Ewing told him that his wage rate would be reviewed in two weeks, while Ewing testified that he merely told Halter that under company policy his wages would be reviewed in three months.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-13\">Late in November or early in December, Halter met with Scott, Johnson and Ewing for the first time to review his wages. Halter testified that during the discussion, Scott commented on the fact that Halter had worked exclusively in union shops and declared \u201cLet the [expletive deleted] union get your raise.\u201d (R. 450); that when Halter protested that he was being discriminated against because of his union background, Scott countered that the company could not grant him a raise because it was involved in a union organizational campaign; and that in the ensuing discussion about the pros and cons of unionism, Scott maintained that Halter\u2019s previous employer had been forced into bankruptcy because it was a union shop and stated that if the Union were successful at MSP, employees like James Bentley, a friend of Halter\u2019s who had recommended that MSP hire Halter, would end up losing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>money because he would be unable to qualify as a journeyman pressman. (R. 451-52).</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">All three management officials denied that Scott made the remark attributed to him by Halter about letting the Union obtain his raise, but did not deny Scott\u2019s remaining remarks. (R. 852, 1215-16, 1312). Johnson did, however, acknowledge that Scott had stated that if the union were certified, future raises would be negotiated by the Union and not individual employees. (R. 1193).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b247-6\">The administrative law judge found that: It is found that Scott did, in fact, make the statements attributed to him by Halter, which were consistent with Scott\u2019s attitude on unionism as manifested in his statements to employees both before and after the election. Scott\u2019s remarks to Halter on the occasion in question, while manifesting his displeasure with the efforts at self-organization of the employees, contained no threat of reprisal or promise of benefit, and, therefore, were not violative of Section 8(a)(1) of the Act.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AM\">* * % * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b247-8\">The preponderance of the credible evidence fails to establish that, at the time Halter was hired, Ewing told him that he would receive a wage review, much less a wage increase, after 2 weeks.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b247-9\">* * * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b247-10\">As to Scott\u2019s remark about letting the Union get him a raise, while it may indicate the measure of Scott's antipathy toward unions, it is insufficient to establish that Halter was denied a raise because of his staunch union adherence. Moreover, the fact that Scott did, in fact, grant Halter a raise of 25 cents an hour in January, albeit as a reward for working the late shift on [a large] Government contract, negates a discriminatory motive in denying him the raise in November. (R. 2313, 2315, 2316).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b247-12\">The Board disagreed with the judge and found that Scott\u2019s statement to Halter did constitute a threat of reprisal and thus violated \u00a7 8(a)(1) of the Act. (R. 2350-51). The Board, despite the language quoted above, also asserted that the judge \u201cdid not specifically conclude whether Ewing had in fact promised Halter that he would be reviewed within 2 weeks\u201d and went on to find that \u201cEwing did in fact promise to review Halter\u2019s wages.\u201d (R. 2350). It then coupled this promise with Scott\u2019s statement and concluded that Halter was discriminatorily denied a wage increase.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-13\">It is clear from the administrative law judge\u2019s opinion that he did find that it had not been established that Ewing had promised Halter a wage review in two weeks and that this finding was based on his assessment of the credibility of Ewing and Halter. In view of these circumstances and the absence of other substantial evidence to support the Board\u2019s finding,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> we hold that the Board\u2019s finding that Ewing had promised Halter a wage review in two weeks is unsupported by substantial evidence. <em>Universal Camera Corp. v. NLRB, supra, </em>340 U.S. at 496-97, 71 S.Ct. 456. On the other hand, we hold that the Board\u2019s finding that Scott\u2019s statement constituted a threat of reprisal was not error for it is the Board\u2019s duty to make the final determination as to whether the Act has been violated. <em>Groendyke Transport, Inc. v. NLRB, </em>530 F.2d 137, 139 (10th Cir.).</p>\n<p id=\"b247-14\">The Board\u2019s finding that Halter was discriminatorily denied a wage increase rests largely on the weight given to Scott\u2019s remark. Though we sustain the Board\u2019s finding that this remark did constitute a threat of reprisal within the meaning of \u00a7 8(a)(1), we cannot agree that the remark alone is also sufficient to support the conclusion that Halter was discriminatorily denied a wage increase. The Board\u2019s analysis does not deal with the bulk of the evidence with respect to the relations between Halter and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>the MSP management (Scott, Johnson and Ewing) which was explored at length in the administrative law judge\u2019s opinion (R. 2312-16). Furthermore, there is no other substantial evidence of anti-union animus directed at Halter.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-4\">In circumstances such as these, where there is insubstantial support for the Board\u2019s inference that anti-union animus motivated the employer\u2019s action, we must accord respect to the contrary inference drawn by the administrative law judge. <em>Cain\u2019s Coffee Co., supra, </em>404 F.2d at 1176; see <em>Universal Camera Corp., supra, </em>340 U.S. at 496-97, 71 S.Ct. 456. Accordingly, we hold that the Board\u2019s conclusion that Halter was discriminatorily denied a wage increase is not supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b248-6\">\n<em>The revocation of the subpoena to NLRB field examiner John Sayre</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b248-7\">During the hearing, Olguin testified to the following conversation with Scott:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-8\">[Scott] said: \u2018Do you think I\u2019ll negotiate with the Union,\u2019 and I said \u2018Probably not,\u2019 and he said \u2018Right\u2019. (R. 306).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b248-9\">This statement does not appear in 01-guin\u2019s pre-hearing Board affidavit which had been taken by John Sayre, a board agent. (R. 2200-02). However on cross examination, Olguin stated that he had told Sayre of these statements \u201cthree or four times\u201d but Sayre had failed to include them in the affidavit. (R. 332-34).</p>\n<p id=\"b248-10\">MSP then caused a subpoena <em>ad testificandum </em>to be issued to Sayre and, pursuant to the procedures mandated in 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 102.118(a) (July 1, 1975),<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> requested the General Counsel\u2019s permission so that Sayre could testify. This permission was denied and the subpoena was revoked. (R. 2186). MSP contends that the only procedure by which MSP could obtain a fair and reasonable opportunity to verify the accuracy of Olguin\u2019s testimony was by examination of Sayre, that granting the request for such testimony was essential to fairness and due process, and that a narrow exception to the governmental privilege was therefore essential since the statement by Mr. Scott in question was a critical part of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-19\">In his telegram refusing to grant permission for the board agent to testify and in his petition to revoke the subpoena, the General Counsel sought to invoke a privilege based on a policy that the investigating agent\u2019s role would be impaired by the likelihood of becoming a material ness.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> See <em>Stephens Produce Co., Inc. v. NLRB, </em>515 F.2d 1373, 1377 (8th Cir.). However, the mere incantation of such a privilege is not conclusive, as the <em>Stephens Produce </em>opinion states. Id. at 1377. And the hearing tribunal and the courts, not the adversary General Counsel, have the responsibility for deciding whether such a privilege is available. <em>NLRB v. Capitol Fish Co., </em>294 F.2d 868, 876 (5th Cir.). In this case, however, we have considered the claim of error and have decided, for reasons that are stated below, that in any event there was no prejudice shown in connection with the revocation of the subpoena. Hence, we need not decide the scope or availability of such a privilege.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>It is true that the judge found that Scott made the statement attributed to him by Olguin and he found also that Olguin\u2019s testimony was not successfully impeached by the absence of the conversation from the pretrial affidavit. (R. 2307). Thus a further challenge to Olguin\u2019s testimony (i. e. that he had told the agent several times about Scott\u2019s statement) by any testimony from the agent that Olguin did not relate such statements by Scott would have likely aided MSP. Nevertheless, this anti-union statement of Scott was not found individually to constitute a violation of \u00a7 8(a)(1). This statement was similar to the one attributed to Scott by Bentley, (R. 2307), and it was one of several statements tending to establish anti-union animus. Thus, we are satisfied that disbelief of this one statement having been made would not have had any substantial effect on the judge\u2019s conclusion, which the Board accepted, that Scott\u2019s \u201cnumerous statements . . . interfered with, restrained and coerced employees in the exercise of rights guaranteed by the Act, thereby violating Section 8(a)(1) of the Act.\u201d (R. 2326, 2346, 2353).</p>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">We conclude that no prejudicial error in the ruling on the subpoena is demonstrated.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-7\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b249-8\">\n<em>Remedies</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b249-9\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b249-10\">\n<em>The order for reinstatement and back pay</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b249-11\">MSP challenges the appropriateness of the Board\u2019s order that Filben and Olguin be reinstated and that they, along with Erlacher, Botello and Gonzalez,<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> be made whole for any loss in pay suffered as a result of the unfair labor practices found. MSP argues it would be inappropriate to grant these remedies since to do so would be a punitive action against MSP without giving proper weight to its economic difficulties. (Brief of Petitioner, 36). And MSP further contends that these remedies are improper because, irrespective of any discriminatory intent, it is clear that Filben, Erlacher, Olguin, Botello and Gonzalez would have been laid off in November, 1974, due to the company\u2019s economic problems. (Id. at 37).</p>\n<p id=\"b249-15\">MSP presses this argument based on its economic difficulties as a complete bar to any reinstatement or back pay remedies. (See Brief for Petitioner, 33 <em>et seq.). </em>However, the finding of an unfair labor practice and discriminatory discharge is presumptive proof that some back pay is owed by the employer. See <em>Albemarle Paper Co. v. Moody, 422 </em>U.S. 405, 420 n.12, 95 S.Ct. 2362, 45 L.Ed.2d 280; <em>NLRB v. Mastro Plastics Corp., </em>354 F.2d 170, 178 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 384 U.S. 972, 86 S.Ct. 1862, 16 L.Ed.2d 682. Furthermore there is significant evidence in the record weighing against MSP\u2019s argument that its economic difficulties serve as a complete bar to any remedial order for reinstatement and back pay. There is proof that not only was work available for laid off and discharged employees, but also that in some instances, new employees were hired during the period of \u201csubstantial economic difficulties,\u201d (Brief for Petitioner, 36), to do work formerly done by discharged employees. See <em>NLRB v. Armcor Industries, </em>535 F.2d 239, 243 (3d Cir.). These circumstances, and the fact that there had never been a layoff in the company\u2019s history, tend to support the Board\u2019s order for reinstatement and back pay. Although the case is close as to Filben,<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> we are persuaded that the record as a whole supports the Board\u2019s order for rein<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>statement of Filben and Olguin and for back pay for those two employees and for Erlacher, Botello and Gonzalez. The order should stand since it is not shown that it is a patent attempt to achieve ends other than those which can fairly be said to effectuate the policies of the Act. <em>NLRB v. J. H. Rutter-Rex Mfg. Co., </em>396 U.S. 258, 263, 90 S.Ct. 417, 24 L.Ed.2d 405.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-4\">For these reasons we cannot agree that MSP\u2019s economic difficulties would serve as a complete bar to the remedial order for reinstatement and back pay. However this does not end the matter. With respect to back pay there will be determinations of the proper amounts to award in accordance with the Board\u2019s procedures. See 29 CFR \u00a7 102.52, <em>et seq. </em>In the compliance proceeding the company has the right to present evidence that jobs were not available for the discriminatees during the back pay period. Back pay is awarded only for the period during which the worker would have worked in the absence of discrimination. See <em>Phelps Dodge Corp. v. NLRB, </em>313 U.S. 177, 199 n.7, 61 S.Ct. 845, 85 L.Ed. 1271; <em>NLRB v. Mastro Plastics Corp., supra, </em>354 F.2d at 175. The burden will be on the company to establish that it would not have had work available for the discriminatees due to factors unrelated to the discriminatory discharges,<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> or that the discriminatees incurred any willful loss of earnings. <em>NLRB v. Mastro Plastics Corp., supra, </em>354 F.2d at 174.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">In connection with the compliance proceeding we note one apparent problem. The Board\u2019s order requires MSP to make the five employees \u201cwhole for any loss of earnings they may have suffered by reason of the discrimination against them, in the manner set forth in the section of the Administrative Law Judge\u2019s Decision entitled \u2018The Remedy.\u2019 \u201d (Board Order, 10; R. 2354). The Order thus adopted the Administrative Law Judge\u2019s Decision, (p. 38, R. 2327), which stated that the \u201cperiods of back pay for which each of said employees shall be made whole is as follows . . \u201d, then giving specified periods for each employee. This provision appears to preclude proof by MSP that jobs were unavailable in the given periods.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-9\">The Board\u2019s order should stand, we feel, as to reinstatement and as to granting back pay, in principle, as a remedy. But we feel we should modify the Order and the Judge\u2019s Decision it adopts to state that in the compliance proceeding back pay will be considered and determined with respect to the periods specified in the Judge\u2019s Decision, the employer being entitled however to present proof of unavailability of work, willful loss of earnings and similar defensive proof in accordance with the Board\u2019s usual procedure. See <em>NLRB v. Mastro Plastics Corp., supra, </em>354 F.2d at 174-75.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-10\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b250-11\">\n<em>The bargaining order issue</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b250-12\">The Union argues that the Board erred in refusing to issue an order, as recommended by the administrative law judge, requiring MSP to bargain with the Union.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-13\">The Union sought a bargaining order under <em>NLRB v. Gissel Packing Co., </em>395 U.S. 575, 89 S.Ct. 1918, 23 L.Ed.2d 547. The judge noted that this case differs from <em>Gissel </em>in th\u00e1t here the unfair labor practices occurred after, rather than before, the election. Furthermore, here, unlike <em>Gissel, </em>the Union won and was already certified. The judge nonetheless felt that the \u201cpervasive\u201d nature of the unfair labor practices justified a \u201clogical extension of the <em>Gissel </em>holding\u201d and recommended a bargaining order. The Board agreed that the practices were sufficiently pervasive to justify a bargaining order but found, with one member dissenting, that the order was unnecessary since the Union had been certified.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-14\">The Union argues that MSP\u2019s pervasive discriminatory practices require such an order, and that it is anomalous to give a lesser remedy where the Union succeeded in win<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>ning the election, despite the illegal conduct. It further argues that such an order is appropriate where the Union has had its strength diminished through layoff of its key support, thus denying it the opportunity to bargain effectively, from a position of full strength, during the year following its certification.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b251-5\">We cannot agree. The Board is vested with considerable discretion in deciding whether such an order is appropriate and we are not at liberty to substitute our judgment for that of the Board, even if our appraisal of the matter differs. <em>Ann Lee Sportswear, Inc. v. NLRB, </em>543 F.2d 739, 743 (10th Cir.). If there has been a refusal to bargain in good faith, it may be reasonable and proper to extend the certification year. <em>NLRB v. Burnett Construction Co., </em>350 F.2d 57, 60 (10th Cir.). We feel the Board was within the bounds of its discretion in not entering a <em>Gissel </em>bargaining order since certification and a duty to bargain already exist.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-6\">Accordingly, the Board\u2019s order will be modified by setting aside the findings and relief granted as to the denial of a wage increase to Douglas Halter; the order will be modified as noted with respect to permitting the employer to present proof of unavailability of work and other defensive matter in the compliance proceeding; otherwise the findings and order of the Board are sustained and enforcement of the order as modified will be granted.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b239-11\">. The \u201cEmployees\u2019 Handbook\u201d, which is distributed to all employees, states in pertinent part: \u201cIt should be noted that no one has been laid off in the history of the Company for lack of work\u201d. (R. 1639, G.C.Ex. 3 at 11).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b240-8\">. Since the challenged ballots could not affect the outcome of the election, the challenges were not resolved. Thereafter, the company filed timely objections to conduct affecting the, results of the election. The Regional Director, after conducting an investigation, issued his report which recommended that the objections be overruled. (R. 97-98). The company filed exceptions to the report. These objections were overruled when the Board issued its Decision and Certification of Representative, adopting the Regional Director\u2019s findings and recommendations, and certifying the Union as the exclusive representative of MSP\u2019s employees. (R. 2294).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b240-9\">. The actual decision to lay off and the selection of the affected employees appears to have been made on November 15, though it had apparently been decided earlier in the week that if additional work was not received, \u201cthere would have to be some redistribution in the work force.\u201d (R. 1005-07).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b240-16\">.

The administrative law judge had found that the rules announced by Scott on the morning of November 18 were not \u201cchanged working conditions.\u201d (R. 2294-99). The Board disagreed and instead found that the (1) ban on unnecessary talking and visiting, (2) the staggering of lunch periods and (3) the discontinuance of free coffee were violations of \u00a7 8(a)(1). (R. 2352).</p>\n<p id=\"b242-11\">MSP has chosen not to seek review of this aspect of the Board\u2019s order so as to \u201csimplify and focus the issues before this Court.\u201d Brief for Petitioner, 4. The Union evinces some concern that this concession on the part of MSP will in some way limit our review of the Board\u2019s order and calls upon this Court to review the entire record. Brief of Intervenor, 5-6. We believe this concern to be unfounded for it is well settled that our determination as to whether the Board\u2019s findings are supported by substantial evidence is made with respect to the record as a whole. <em>Universal Camera Corp. v.

As discussed previously, note 8, <em>supra, </em>MSP has not petitioned for review of the Board\u2019s findings of unfair labor practices with respect to the changes in working conditions. MSP has also apparently decided not to seek review of the Board\u2019s findings that certain statements by Scott to Olguin, Botello and another employee, James Bentley, constituted violations of \u00a7 8(a)(1). Thus the Board\u2019s treatment of these issues is unnecessary. (See Brief for the National Labor Relations Board, 21-23).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b243-11\">.

Such a history of neither laying off employees nor cutting back work in lean months is relevant. See <em>NLRB v. Lively Service Co., </em>290 F.2d 205, 207 (10th Cir.).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b245-20\">. Timing is an important factor in determining the validity of an inference of discrimination. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number><em>NLRB v. Montgomery Ward &amp; Co., Inc., supra, </em>554 F.2d at 1002.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b246-9\">. The administrative law judge found that MSP was not so much concerned with individual activities of employees as with the fact that a majority of the employees voted for the Union and that it was determined to punish them for exercising their right of self-determination. (Decision, 36).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b246-14\">. Actually, in the case of Botello the record shows some management awareness of Botello favoring the Union. There were findings that MSP\u2019s chief management officer, Mr. Scott, made statements about Botello having \u201cvoted for the union.\u201d (Decision, 21, 34). The record supports these findings. (R. 386-90). This portion of the judge\u2019s findings was adopted by the Board without comment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b247-11\">. The Board did not disagree with the judge\u2019s other findings that Halter had been hired only as a temporary employee and had not been discriminated against with respect to his eventual layoff.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b247-15\">. The only other evidence offered in support of its finding is the fact that a wage review did occur about a month after Halter started work.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b248-11\">. 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 102.118(a) (July 1, 1975) provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-12\">. . . no . . field examiner . . shall . . . testify in behalf of any party to any cause pending in any court or before the Board, . . . with respect to any information, facts or other matter coming to his knowledge in his official capacity . . , whether in answer to a subpoena or otherwise, without the written permission of the . . general counsel . . .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b248-17\">Though dated July 1, 1975, these regulations were in effect during the hearings in April of 1975.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b248-20\">. The petition and the telegram from the General Counsel referred to a policy that ordinarily permission is not granted for Board investigating agents to testify. It said the reason for the policy is that the highly sensitive and delicate role of the agent would be impaired if a real likelihood existed that the agent would be enmeshed as a material witness, and that this request for the testimony showed no basis for departure from the policy. (R. 2185-86).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b249-12\">. Erlacher and Gonzalez had returned to full-time work as of the date of the hearing while Botello had refused an offer of reinstatement. (R. 2305, 2310-11).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b249-13\">. We must agree the case is close as to Filben because elimination of the full-time platemaking position he held was being considered before the start of the union campaign and was recommended in an efficiency study. However, as the administrative law judge noted, the validity of the study was open to some question. (See R. 2318-23). We note too that other employees, including one recently hired, engaged in platemaking after Filben\u2019s layoff and discharge, (R. 261-62, 276, 429-30, 518, 520-21, 578-81, 596, 1161-63), and there had never been a layoff at the company before. We feel the record as a whole does support the reinstatement and back pay order as to Filben.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b250-6\">. A finding of discriminatory discharge carries with it the implication that suitable employment was available and the employer has the burden to overcome such a prima facie case. See <em>NLRB v. Flora Construction Co., </em>354 F.2d 107, 108 (10th Cir.).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b251-8\">. The Union says it will have lost the advantage of the conclusive presumption of majority status which expired one year after the certification on May 21, 1975, before compliance is achieved.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
