The Board\u2019s order is reported at 223 NLRB No. 93 and is based in part on findings made in a representation proceeding under Section 9 of the Act. See 216 NLRB No. 131. The issue is whether the \u201claboratory conditions\u201d were destroyed by assertions by the union during the campaign relating to its intentions in the event it won the election. The Board, with one member dissenting, found in the representation proceeding that the statements made by the union were not misrepresentations within the meaning of <em>Hollywood Ceramics Company, Inc., </em>140 NLRB 221 (1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b76-23\">In this court the employer contends that the case is not controlled by <em>Hollywood Ceramics, </em>supra, since the nature of the statements made by the union were such as to constitute an abuse of Board process. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>Though the facts in this case are somewhat different from those in any case cited by the parties, upon consideration of the entire record together with the briefs and oral arguments of counsel the court concludes that the Board did not err in its treatment of the issues in the case. '</p>\n<p id=\"b77-5\">The order of the Board is enforced.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
