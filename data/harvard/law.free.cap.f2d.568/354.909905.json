The EEOC sought prohibitory and mandatory injunctive relief against sexual and/or racial discrimination, and back pay. Appalachian Power moved to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction asserting that the Commissioner\u2019s charge which commenced the proceedings prior to the federal suit was not given under oath or affirmation as was required by Section 706(b) of the Act, as amended, in 1972, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">Following a hearing, the district court agreed with Appalachian. Judge Dalton held that since the underlying \u201ccharge\u201d by the EEOC was not under \u201coath or affirmation,\u201d then it was not a valid charge. Accordingly, since the EEOC had no jurisdiction to proceed with its investigation, then neither did the district court. The EEOC appeals, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">We have carefully considered the oral arguments in this case, the briefs, and the record. We affirm for the reasons set forth by the district court in its opinion and judgment entered September 10, 1976, as supplemented by its order and judgment entered September 30, 1976, <em>Equal Employment Opportunity Commission v. Appalachian Power Company, et al., </em>Civil Action No. 76-0019(R), Western District of Virginia, Roanoke Division.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-7\">Like the court below, we note that Section 706(b) of the Act, as amended, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(b) is cast in mandatory terms requiring that \u201c[cjharges [including those instituted by EEOC itself] shall be in writing under oath of affirmation . . .\u201d We have previously held the requirements of \u00a7 706(b) of the Act to be mandatory, <em>Patterson v. American Tobacco Co., </em>535 F.2d 257, 271-272 (4th Cir. 1976), and see no reason to ignore the plain language that Congress has enacted.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-9\">The judgment of the district court is</p>\n<p id=\"b425-10\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
