Sufficiency Of The Evidence</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b484-6\">The United States Attorney for the Southern District of Florida had been conducting an investigation into various allegations stemming from insurance claims filed by the law offices of James A. Davis for numerous clients who had received medical treatment from Dr. M. S. Fox<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> or Westchester Hospital or both. Settlement of accident cases following negotiations with insurance companies or trial would be made by Davis\u2019 office. The insurance company would pay claims to Davis who, in turn, would disburse the proceeds to his clients, the accident victims, after deducting attorneys\u2019 fees, medical expenses, court costs, investigative fees, and other related costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-7\">Abrams, who worked as a secretary and bookkeeper in Davis\u2019 office, was subpoenaed by the grand jury in 1976 and was ultimately granted use immunity. She made three appearances before the grand jury; Counts II and III arose out of her July 26, 1976 appearance.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b484-8\">\n<em>A. Count II: The Yva Henry Case</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"Av0\">\n<em>1. Documentary Evidence</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AiZ\">The false statements which formed the basis of this count involved a cost breakdown which had been prepared for Yva Henry, a client of Davis. Henry had written a letter dated March 12, 1974 to Paul Gross of the Florida Bar complaining about the amount she was to receive in settlement of her claim for an accident which had occurred in April 1973.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Gross forwarded this complaint to Davis on March 15, 1974 and requested a written response.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> By letter dated April 1, 1974, signed for Davis by Abrams, the latter forwarded to the Florida Bar a \u201cclosing statement\u201d on the Henry case,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> containing a $231.50 charge for \u201cCosts.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b484-9\">On April 2, 1974, Gross called Davis\u2019 office to request a breakdown of the $231.50 in costs as shown by the following telephone message directed to \u201cAnita:\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b484-10\">Yva Henry\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b484-11\">(cost 231.50 wants</p>\n<p id=\"b484-12\">5564 Case NoJ<footnotemark>9</footnotemark>l breakdown?)</p>\n<p id=\"b484-13\">That same day, Abrams signed a letter to the Florida Bar on behalf of Davis, enclos<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>ing a breakdown she prepared which listed these items:<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-6\">CHARGE SHEET ON YVA HENRY CASE NO. 5564</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A1_\">[ 1 ] Conference with Dr. M.

The third portion of Gov\u2019t Ex. 14 comprises an exact duplicate of an undated typed bill to Davis for the two office conferences in April and June 1973 which appears in the Henry file in Davis\u2019 office.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b485-42\">Item [3] on the breakdown, relating to $107.50 for investigation and photography, was ostensibly covered by a May 17, 1973 typed invoice in duplicate on the billhead of Worldwide Detective Agency.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> This bill charged $100 for investigative services and $7.50 for \u201cauto.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b485-43\">With regard to item [4] covering $35 for photographs, the Henry file contained two critical documents: a photography shop invoice for film and a film developing envelope, <em>both </em>dated April 2, 1974, the same day on which the Florida Bar telephone inquiry and the Abrams breakdown were made.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The photographs of the location of the Henry accident which were placed in the Henry file could not have been taken any time before March 1974.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b486-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>The most significant document in Davis\u2019 Henry file is a slip of paper comprising part of Gov\u2019t Ex. 7.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The first four lines of this slip, listing the four items, are in Davis\u2019 handwriting.

The Grand Jury Testimony</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b486-31\">The testimony which formed Count II of the indictment fills nine legal-size pages. So that we do not further lengthen this opinion, that testimony is attached as an appendix. The questions and answers are numbered for easy reference and the statements which we believe the jury could reasonably have concluded were false are italicized.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-32\">Abrams maintained throughout her grand jury testimony<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> that the $231.50 figure was based on bills actually in the file prior to the settlement of the Henry case, on the cost sheet she prepared as the Henry case progressed, or on cost cards which the accountant had.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Indeed, she effectively <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>denied fabricating the costs.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> We believe that the evidence overwhelmingly supported a jury conclusion beyond a reasonable doubt that she gave false testimony.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Our view is that the jury could have reasonably concluded that actual events proceeded along the following lines and that Abrams must have known about and remembered those events when she testified before the grand jury: When the Florida Bar request for the $231.50 cost breakdown was made, Abrams \u2014 or someone in Davis\u2019 office with Abrams\u2019 knowledge \u2014 arranged to have the photographs taken (item [4], $35), Davis listed minor amounts to be charged for perfunctory reports made in almost every accident case (items [5] \u2014 [7], $14), and Abrams\u2014 or someone in Davis\u2019 office with Abrams\u2019 knowledge \u2014 arranged with someone in Dr. Fox\u2019s office to bill Davis for $75 of those costs (items [1] and [2]). And when Abrams totaled those costs and arrived at only $124, she subtracted the subtotal from $231.50, got $107.50, and she \u2014 or someone in Davis\u2019 office with her knowledge \u2014 fabricated an invoice on Worldwide Detective Agency billhead (item [3]) to justify the $107.50 difference. This view is based on the following.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">First, it is clear from the documentary evidence that the Fox conferences were not billed in the ordinary course (see notes 12 and 23, supra). Second, the Fox bill is not dated as is the other Fox invoice for $475 (see notes 8 and 12, supra). Third, it is also clear that the Davis office requested that these conferences be billed in response to the Florida Bar inquiry. Thus, as to the Fox conferences, there was sufficient evidence for the jury to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that Abrams violated \u00a7 1623 when she denied knowing the circumstances under which the undated Fox bill was prepared.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b487-18\">There was also sufficient evidence to support a conclusion beyond a reasonable doubt that Abrams gave perjured testimony concerning item [3], the $107.50 invoice from Worldwide Detective Agency for investigation and photography. Weigel, owner of Worldwide, stated that a search of his records disclosed no investigation having been conducted on the Yva Henry case. Moreover, when Weigel billed clients, he never submitted the original and the copy as ostensibly was done in the Henry case.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> Hallen, a Worldwide employee who did investigative work for Davis on Weigel\u2019s license, also found no record of investigative or photographic work done in behalf of Henry. Hallen would bill Davis by submitting to Abrams handwritten slips containing case numbers and the plaintiff\u2019s name; he never typed invoices. Abrams paid Hallen directly by check. Hallen unequivocally denied submitting the typed $107.50 invoice of Gov\u2019t Ex. 10.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> Furthermore, sometime in 1973, Hallen, with Weigel\u2019s permission, had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>given blank Worldwide billheads to Joe Moore, Davis\u2019 office manager.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b488-4\">Based on this uncontradicted testimony, the jury was justified in finding that Abrams made false statements when she named Hallen as the source of the $107.50 figure<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> and when she said that the bill was prepared by the investigator,<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> and submitted.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> In addition, Abrams\u2019 asserted failure to remember and denial of knowledge as to what she was doing when she performed the mathematical calculation of Gov\u2019t Ex. 7<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> could reasonably have been considered perjured.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b488-5\">Similarly, there was abundant evidence to support a beyond-a-reasonable-doubt conclusion that Abrams\u2019 testimony concerning the $35.00 for photographs was false. The invoice for film and the film envelope were both dated April 2,1974, the same day on which the Florida Bar telephone inquiry was made when the Henry case was, for all intents and purposes, closed.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> Hallen never performed any photographic work on the Henry case and did not submit the invoice for photography services. And at least one of the photographs in the Henry file establish that the pictures were not taken until at least eleven months after Mrs. Henry\u2019s April 1973 mishap.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> No sensible explanation was forthcoming as to why photography costs need have been incurred in connection with a closed case, and the grand jury gave Abrams every opportunity to offer one.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b488-16\">Thus, we think a jury could justifiably find that Abrams committed perjury when she (i) told the grand jury that the bills were Dave Hallen\u2019s,<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> (ii) denied knowing the circumstances under which the photographic bills were obtained,<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> and (iii) denied that the bills were obtained the day after receiving the Florida Bar letter to justify the costs.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b488-17\">Lastly, based on all the evidence relating to the four items on the breakdown, we believe that a jury could conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that Abrams\u2019 statements that the $231.50 in costs came from cost sheets and cost cards,<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> and her denial of attempts to justify the costs<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> were false.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-18\">Appellant\u2019s sufficiency challenge is multi-pronged. Abrams argues first that she responded to questions by describing the office routine she normally \u201cwould\u201d use, instead of stating what she actually \u201cdid\u201d with respect to a particular item. We agree with this argument as to certain answers,<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> but believe it conveniently over-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>looks many others.<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> This argument also ignores the settled principle that every answer set forth in a single count does not have to be false to sustain a conviction. <em>United States v. Bonacorsa, </em>2 Cir., 1976, 528 F.2d 1218, 1221-22; <em>Stassi v. United States, </em>5 Cir., 1963, 401 F.2d 259, 262, <em>vacated on other grounds sub nom. Giordano v. United States, </em>1968, 394 U.S. 310, 89 S.Ct. 1163, 22 L.Ed.2d 297.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">Second, appellant contends that there was no evidence introduced to show that she willfully and knowingly lied to the grand jury, that is, that she knew the charges were not incurred and remembered that fact. In this connection we are asked to ponder the thousands of cases which passed through, and the thousands of transactions taking place in, this busy, disorganized law office, all of which made it unreasonable for Abrams to remember the details of the Henry cost breakdown. There are several answers to this contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-6\">Abrams typed and signed on Davis\u2019 behalf the letters to the Florida Bar, and she \u2014 according to her grand jury testimony \u2014 prepared the cost breakdown. This office work was necessary only because a very serious complaint about Davis had been lodged with the Bar. Abrams was an employee in a law office where such complaints should not have been an everyday occurrence and should not have been treated routinely or cavalierly. All the more so because Abrams was well aware in April 1974 that Davis had been the target of a recent investigation. Indeed, that investigation prompted a meeting of Davis\u2019 staff which Abrams attended and during which Davis instructed the staff to take certain actions.<footnotemark>45</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b489-9\">In light of this background, the jury could have reasonably concluded that the Henry cost breakdown was not as forgettable as appellant contends and that Abrams knew full well that certain of her answers were false. This is especially so in light of the overwhelming evidence which could lead a jury to conclude that Abrams must have known or recalled that the $107.50 cost for investigation and photography was <em>never </em>incurred and that the $75 for conferences with Dr. Fox and the $35 for photographs were somehow fabricated in response to the Florida Bar inquiry.<footnotemark>46</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b489-10\">A similar argument was raised in <em>United States v. Chapin, </em>1975, 169 U.S.App.D.C. 303, 515 F.2d 1274, 1284. In rejecting the sufficiency attack, the Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-11\">[I]n the absence of a statement by the defendant, the falsity of an \u201cI don\u2019t recall\u201d answer must be proven by circumstantial evidence. This does not mean that proof is impossible. As another court has stated, \u201cThe jury must infer the state of a man\u2019s mind from the things he says and does. Such an inference may come from proof of the objective falsity itself, from proof of a motive to lie, and from other facts tending to show that the defendant really knew the things he claimed not to know\u201d or recall. [Citations omitted.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b489-12\"><em>Id., </em>169 U.S.App.D.C. at 313, at. 515 F.2d 1284. In applying these principles, there was abundant proof \u2014 already detailed at length \u2014 of objective falsity and other facts tending to show that Abrams really knew or recalled that which she denied knowing or recalling. As to motive, the jury knew that Abrams was employed by Davis when she appeared before the grand jury and it was at liberty to draw reasonable inferences concerning motive from the employer-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>employee relationship, as well as from the grant of use immunity.<footnotemark>47</footnotemark> The jury, properly instructed, resolved this issue against Abrams and we see no reason to disturb its verdict here.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-4\">The third prong of Abrams\u2019 sufficiency attack relates to materiality. She urges that even if we hold her answers to be perjurious, they were not \u201ccapable of influencing the grand jury on the issue it was investigating; namely, whether Attorney James Davis was using the United States Mails to defraud insurance companies by \u2018ambulance chasing,\u2019 cooperating with doctors to increase medical bills to \u2018get over\u2019 Florida\u2019s Uninsured Motorist Statute threshold amounts and similar conduct.\u201d Appellant\u2019s brief at 50.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">The test for materiality, as Abrams correctly concedes, is whether the false testimony was capable of influencing the tribunal on the issue before it. <em>E. g., United States </em>v. <em>Brumley, </em>5 Cir., 1977, 560 F.2d 1268; <em>United States v. Damato, </em>5 Cir., 1977, 554 F.2d 1371; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Parr, </em>5 Cir., 1975, 516 F.2d 458. However, the statements need not be material to any <em>particular </em>issue but may be material to any proper matter of inquiry. <em>Damato, supra; United States v. Makris, </em>5 Cir., 1973, 483 F.2d 1082; <em>United States v. Gremillion, </em>5 Cir., 1972, 464 F.2d 901; <em>Barnes v. United States, </em>5 Cir., 1967, 378 F.2d 646.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-10\">The grand jury was investigating various allegations stemming from insurance claims. That body has substantial leeway in conducting its investigation. This Court has approved the following language from <em>United States v. Stone, </em>2 Cir., 1970, 429 F.2d 138, 140:<footnotemark>48</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-11\">A grand jury\u2019s investigation is not fully carried out until every available clue has been run down and all witnesses examined in every proper way to find if a crime has been committed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b490-12\">The questions seeking to determine whether costs deducted from Davis\u2019 clients\u2019 payments were actually incurred was * a proper subject of grand jury inquiry which resulted in the indictment of Davis and Fox for use of the mails to execute a fraudulent scheme. Abrams argues that Davis\u2019 clients were not the victims or complainants, that the insurance companies were, ergo, no materiality. Appellant\u2019s brief at 51. We are totally at a loss to understand this argument. Not only were the insurance companies victimized, but so were Davis\u2019 clients and the Florida Bar as well.<footnotemark>49</footnotemark> If the fabri<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>cation and inflation of medical and other costs were part and parcel of an illegal scheme to obtain money and property by false representations, the grand jury was authorized to explore every aspect of that scheme in an effort to determine whether a federal crime had been committed.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">A subpart of the materiality argument is that Abrams\u2019 answers in no way \u201cdeterred, misled or otherwise influenced the grand jury from conducting and completing its investigation.\u201d Appellant\u2019s brief at 50. This contention misperceives the legal requirements regarding materiality. The government need not show that because of the perjured testimony, the grand jury threw in the towel. Actual impediment of the investigation is not required. <em>E. g., United States v. Makris, supra; United States v. Gremillion, supra. </em>Such a ridiculous rule would mean that the grand jury believed the witness and placed so much importance on his testimony that further inquiry was useless. Grand jurors are capable of judging credibility and they are free to disbelieve a witness and persevere in an investigation without immunizing a perjurer. All the law requires is that the witness\u2019 answers were capable of influencing the tribunal on the issue before it, including any matters collateral thereto. The answers analyzed above easily passed that test and the Trial Court\u2019s finding and instruction on materiality were proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-6\">Finally, Abrams complains that the government failed to place before the jury evidence of materiality. This complaint is frivolous. One way in which the government can meet its burden on this score is by introducing the transcript of the prior proceeding. <em>See Damato, supra, </em>554 F.2d at 1373 and cases cited in note 3. To paraphrase what one Court stated, the best way to know what the grand jury deems material is by reading what it asked about. <em>United States v. Sweig, </em>S.D.N.Y., 1970, 316 F.Supp. 1148, 1164. Not only was the entire transcript of all three Abrams\u2019 grand jury appearances introduced at trial, but the jury additionally had before it the Abrams indictment which set forth the factual basis<footnotemark>50</footnotemark> for the Trial Judge\u2019s finding and instruction on materiality as required in this Circuit. See <em>Brumley </em>and <em>Damato, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b491-10\">\n<em>B.

Jones. </em>Apparently neither of these two depositions had anything to do with the Valdez case.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-4\">The following Abrams testimony is the subject of count III:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-5\">Q.l Now, looking at Grand Jury Exhibit No. 2, do you recognize the handwriting?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-6\">A.1 Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-7\">Q.2 Whose handwriting is that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-8\">A.2 Mine.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-9\">Q.3 All that handwriting?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-10\">A.3 Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-11\">Q.4 You have depositions listed there.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-12\">A.4 Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-13\">Q.5 That\u2019s your handwriting, also?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-14\">A.5 Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-15\">Q.6 In cases when you charge for a deposition like that did the particular client have a deposition taken?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-16\">\u25a0 A.6 Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-17\">Q.7 And they would be \u2014 would you have somebody, a court reporter there to take down what they said?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-18\">A.7 I wouldn\u2019t be aware \u2014 -I wouldn\u2019t .be there when the court reporter was there.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-19\">Q.8 But there would be a cost?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-20\">A.8 Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-21\">Q.9 Who would give you that cost?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-22\">How would you know what to charge for a particular item like that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-23\">A.9 I would get a bill.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-24\">Q.10 From whom?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-25\">A.10 From the court reporter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-26\">Q.11 Then you\u2019d take that bill.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-27\">On the bill would it say the deposition or the particular work that was done on that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-28\">A.11 Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-29\">Count III alleges the following violation:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-30\">The aforesaid testimony of Anita Abrams as she then and there well knew and believed, was false in that she had prepared the charge sheet in case number 5469 on Eduardo Valdez which reflects that check number 1897 dated May 19, 1975 in the amount of $80.00 was paid to Jack Besoner and Associates for court reporter costs which she knew did not accurately reflect the costs; all in violation of Title 18, United States Code, Section 1623.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b492-33\">While it is undoubtedly true that the Valdez'charge sheet did not accurately reflect the costs, it is clear that Abrams was never asked whether and never stated that the charge sheet did accurately reflect the costs. Indeed, careful scrutiny of these answers in light of <em>Bronston v. United States, </em>1973, 409 U.S. 352, 93 S.Ct. 595, 34 L.Ed.2d 568 reveals that none of these answers is literally false. <em>Bronston </em>stands for the proposition that the federal perjury statute, 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1621, is not violated when a witness gives an evasive, nonresponsive but literally true answer, even if the answer is intentionally misleading and arguably false by negative implication.<footnotemark>54</footnotemark> Moreover, <em>Bronston </em>expressly places on the questioner the burden of pinning the witness down to the specific object of the inquiry. Chief Justice Burger wrote, \u201cPrecise questioning is imperative as a predicate for the offense of perjury.\u201d 409 U.S. at 362, 93 S.Ct. at 602, 34 L.Ed.2d at 576.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-34\">As to the specific answers contained in Count III, there is no indication in the record that answers 1-5 are false. Questions and answers 7-11 are framed in terms of what Abrams \u201cwould do\u201d as a matter of normal office routine and there is insufficient evidence in the record to support a conclusion beyond a reasonable doubt that these answers are false. None of questions 7-11 asks specifically what Abrams actually did with respect to the Valdez case. The only question which comes even close to asking directly about Valdez, by use of the verb \u201cdid\u201d instead of \u201cwould,\u201d is No. 6: <em>\u201cIn cases </em>when you charge for a deposition <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number><em>like that </em>did the particular client have a deposition taken?\u201d (Emphasis added.) This question suffers an infirmity similar to those in questions 7-11, namely, it inquires about cases (plural) \u201clike that\u201d, <em>not </em>about the Valdez case in particular.<footnotemark>55</footnotemark> There is insufficient evidence in the record to support a conclusion beyond a reasonable doubt that Abrams\u2019 affirmative response to question No. 6, indicating that in cases like that a deposition was taken, is false. Because the questioner failed, for whatever reason, to pin Abrams down on these charges and asked instead general hypothetical questions,<footnotemark>56</footnotemark> Abrams\u2019 conviction on Count III must be reversed. Since there is no way at this point for the government to cure the questions\u2019 defects, a judgment of acquittal must be entered on Count III. <em>Brumley, supra, </em>560 F.2d at 1277.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">\n<em>II. Fair Trial</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">Abrams contends that her Fifth Amendment due process right to a fair and impartial trial and her Sixth Amendment right to effective assistance of counsel were violated by the Trial Judge\u2019s conduct which prejudiced the defense in the eyes of the jury. As examples of a biased attitude against the defense, appellant cites nine incidents in the presence of the jury and six in its absence. These incidents fall generally into four categories: (i) interjection into the examination of witnesses; (ii) unjustified criticisms and rebukes of defense counsel; (iii) challenging defense questions without the government interposing an objection; and (iv) generally hostile remarks to defense counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-15\">Appellant relies primarily on this Court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Candelaria-Gonzalez, </em>5 Cir., 1977, 547 F.2d 291, in which disparagement, correction, and interruption of defense counsel was one factor which led to reversal of the conviction.<footnotemark>57</footnotemark> The record does indicate that the trial court exhibited some irritation with defense counsel. But under the standards carefully laid down by Judge Simpson in <em>Candelaria-Gonzalez,</em><footnotemark><em>58</em></footnotemark><em> </em>we are convinced that conduct of the trial did not rise to the level of a constitutional violation of Abrams\u2019 rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-16\">First, the most questionable instances occurred out of the presence of the jury,<footnotemark>59</footnotemark> and the challenged actions before the jury, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>viewed as a whole, simply do not amount to intervention which could have led the jury to a predisposition of guilt by improperly confusing the functions of judge and prosecutor. <em>United States v. Gomez-Rojas, 5 </em>Cir., 1975, 507 F.2d 1213, 1223-24.<footnotemark>60</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>Second, the Court instructed the jury that (i) it was not to assume from his questioning of a witness that he had any opinion on the matter to which the questions related; (ii) it was not to draw any inference against the side to whom an admonition may have been addressed; (iii) it should disregard any opinion of his as to the facts; and (iv) it was the sole judge of Davis\u2019 credibility despite the court\u2019s remarks aimed at putting a stop to repetitious testimony by Davis.<footnotemark>61</footnotemark> Third, defense counsel conceded at oral argument that the Judge\u2019s behavior did not prevent him from conducting the defense as he ordinarily would have. Fourth, the defense was not the sole target of the Judge\u2019s dissatisfaction; the Court demonstrated some pique toward the government as well. <em>See United States v. Bridges, </em>5 Cir., 1977, 551 F.2d 651; <em>Duran v. United States, </em>9 Cir., 1969, 413 F.2d 596, 600. Fifth, and most significant, the acquittal of Abrams on Count I further negates any claim that the jury was affected by the Judge\u2019s allegedly biased attitude. <em>United States v. Bridges, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b495-7\">While we do not condone a Trial Judge\u2019s disparagement of the advocates appearing before him, in the final analysis, the question whether prejudicial trial court conduct reaches constitutional magnitude is a matter of degree. In light of all the factors enumerated above, we do not believe that, standing alone, the court\u2019s handling of the trial so prejudiced the defense in the eyes of the jury as to warrant reversal on Fifth or Sixth Amendment grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-23\">\n<em>III. Failure To Grant Mistrial</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b495-24\">The government called as a witness Sgt. Paul Janowski who had assisted in executing the search warrant of Davis\u2019 office.<footnotemark>62</footnotemark> When asked by whom he was employed, Janowski responded, \u201cDade County Organized Crime Bureau.\u201d Defense counsel immediately objected and moved for a mistrial, stating that the answer was prejudicial. The motion was summarily denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-25\">Abrams urges that this answer improperly permitted the jury to infer that she was in some way linked to organized crime or the Mafia, resulting in prejudice that requires reversal. Alternatively, appellant contends that the trial court\u2019s conduct, taken together with the denial of the mistrial motion, should result in reversal as in <em>Candelaria-Gonzalez, supra.</em><footnotemark><em>63</em></footnotemark><em> </em>We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-26\">Defense counsel conceded at oral argument before us that Janowski in fact worked for the Dade County Organized Crime Bureau. The answer was therefore <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>truthful. Appellant also concedes that it is customary to have witnesses state where they are employed. In addition, we are compelled to ask one question: if the answer had in fact infected the jury in the manner suggested, why would it have acquitted Abrams on Count I? Moreover, the jury was instructed more than once that the <em>sole issue </em>before it was whether Abrams deliberately lied to the grand jury and that nothing she did in Davis\u2019 office by way of over- or undercharging a client was relevant. Another factor negating likely prejudice is the jury\u2019s possession during its deliberation of all Abrams\u2019 grand jury testimony in which there was not one shred of evidence linking Abrams or the Davis office to the Mafia or organized crime. The possibility that this one isolated answer \u2014 given in the context of the whole trial where there was not another word to show any connection to the syndicate \u2014 could cause a reasonable juror to jump to the conclusion that Abrams had any such connection is farfetched. We refuse to credit jurors with such active imaginations and so little common sense.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-4\">The Trial Judge did not abuse his discretion in denying the motion for a mistrial and the record, taken as a whole, fails to demonstrate that Abrams was denied a fair and impartial trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">The conviction and sentence on Count II is affirmed. The conviction on Count III is reversed and a judgment of acquittal is to be entered on that count.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-6\">AFFIRMED IN PART and REVERSED IN PART.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-7\">APPENDIX <footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b496-8\">JULY 26, 1976 GRAND JURY TESTIMONY OF ANITA ABRAMS SET FORTH IN COUNT II OF THE INDICTMENT</p>\n<p id=\"b496-9\">Q.l The message, according to the notation, says \u201cAnita space Eva Henry costs space $231.50 space wants breakdown,\u201d and gives the case number.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-10\">Now, after you received this telephone message, did you obtain a breakdown of these costs?</p>\n<p id=\"b496-11\">A.l Yes, I did.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-12\">Q.2 Where did you get that from?</p>\n<p id=\"b496-13\">A.2 <em>From our cost sheet and the cards that the accountant would have.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b496-14\">Q.3 Now, what has been marked as page two of this item, which is a letter dated April 1, 1974, do you recognize that?</p>\n<p id=\"b496-15\">A.3 Yes, I do.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-16\">Q.4 Do your initials appear as the typist on this?</p>\n<p id=\"b496-17\">A.4 Yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-18\">Q.5 Attached to that is a breakdown of the costs on Eva Henry, is that correct?</p>\n<p id=\"b496-19\">A.5 Yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-20\">Q.6 Now, on this charge sheet, on Eva Henry, as attached to this letter to the Florida Bar list is, first of all, well it lists a number of minor charges such as $3 for accident report, $6 Westchester General Hospital medical records, Jackson Memorial Hospital medical records, I believe that\u2019s a total of $14 right there.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-21\">Then there\u2019s also a charge here for $35 for photographs.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-22\">Now, this request came in and this letter was sent out on April 1, 1974.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-23\">Do you recognize this copy of a bill which appeared in the Eva Henry file which is page number three of that exhibit which is a bill for film?</p>\n<p id=\"b496-24\">A.6 Yes, I do.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-25\">Q.7 Dated April 2, 1974.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-26\">Do you recognize that?</p>\n<p id=\"b496-27\">A.7 Yes, I do.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-28\">Q.8 Do you recall the circumstances under which that bill was obtained?</p>\n<p id=\"b496-29\">A.8 I know that the investigator, Dave Hallen, would take photographs and bill us for that.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-30\">Q.9 After the case was closed?</p>\n<p id=\"b496-31\">A.9 Well, sometimes a bill is not submitted until after the case is closed.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>Q.10 But this is not a bill from Mr. Hallen.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">This is a bill for film.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-6\">A.10 He would have paid that bill himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-7\">Q.ll He wouldn\u2019t have paid it until like a year after the case was closed?</p>\n<p id=\"b497-8\">A.11 No.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-9\">What I\u2019m saying is he would pay it out of his own pocket and collect it from the office.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-10\">Q.12 When would he pay it?</p>\n<p id=\"b497-11\">A.12 When he gets it.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-12\">Q.13 Why he would be getting a bill for film on the Eva Henry case the day after the letter from the Florida Bar comes in asking for a breakdown on costs?</p>\n<p id=\"b497-13\">A.13 I wouldn\u2019t know what he would do.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-14\">All I know is that sometimes, before the case is \u2014 he would pay a bill before and submit it to us after.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-15\">Q.14 Now, this amount that you have here, $35 for photographs, which, apparently, is based on a bill for film and a copy of a cover envelope from the developing company also dated April 2, 1974, now these two amounts, which constitute the bill for $35 on photographs, where you would have gotten the bill for film or a bill for photographs prior to receiving these two items?</p>\n<p id=\"b497-16\">A.14 From Dave Hallen.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-17\">* * * * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b497-18\">Q.15 Isn\u2019t it true, Miss Abrams, that after you received a letter from the Florida Bar or a note from the Florida Bar asking for a breakdown of costs, that these items, the bill for film and the bill for photographs, were obtained the day after so that you would have something in your file to justify that cost?</p>\n<p id=\"b497-19\">A.15 <em>Not to my knowledge.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b497-20\">Q.16 All right.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-21\">You said you did type up this letter to the Florida Bar, right?</p>\n<p id=\"b497-22\">A.16 Yes, I did.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-23\">Q.17 You did type up this charge sheet on Eva Henry?</p>\n<p id=\"b497-24\">A.17 Yes, I did.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-25\">Q.18 Where did you get the figures from this that appear on the charge sheet?</p>\n<p id=\"b497-26\">A. 18 <em>From what I have on my own charge sheets on what was on the charge cards.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b497-27\">Q.19 You didn\u2019t use the journal entries, then?</p>\n<p id=\"b497-28\">A.19 Not for the charge cards.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-29\">Q.20 No.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-30\">I didn\u2019t ask for the charge cards.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-31\">I asked for this letter.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-32\">I asked, what records did you use to prepare this charge sheet which was submitted to the Florida Bar on Eva Henry?</p>\n<p id=\"b497-33\">A.20 Well, I would get it from a charge sheet, like the one that\u2019s here on Valdez, and if there was a charge card that the accountant would have.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-34\">Q.21 Now, listed on this charge sheet of Eva Henry is a charge of $107.50 for investigation in photography.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-35\">Now, where would you have gotten that amount from?</p>\n<p id=\"b497-36\">A.21 From Dave Hallen.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-37\">Q.22 Okay.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-38\">You didn\u2019t get it from Dave Hallen when the Florida Bar asked for a breakdown, did you?</p>\n<p id=\"b497-39\">A.22 Probably did.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-40\">I don\u2019t recall exactly when I got it from him.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-41\">Q.23 Your case was closed by then, right?</p>\n<p id=\"b497-42\">A.23 I don\u2019t remember exactly when it was closed and when there was a letter from the Florida Bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-43\">Q.24 This charge \u2014 closing statement that you referred to before has a listed cost on here of $231.50 and part of that cost is, supposedly, made up by this charge of Mr. Hallen for a hundred and seven dollars, is that right?</p>\n<p id=\"b497-44\">A.24 Yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>Q.25 Now, when you prepared this, which was prepared prior to the time that Miss Henry made her request to the Florida Bar, where did you get the figure of a hundred and seven dollars from for investigative services?</p>\n<p id=\"b498-4\">A.25 <em>Dave Hallen.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\">******</p>\n<p id=\"b498-6\">Q.26 . . . Now this thing on Yva Henry here, on what has been marked as Government\u2019s Exhibit No. 9, which, first of all, contains a message of a phone call to you that we\u2019ve gone over before, saying \u201cAnita, Yva Henry, costs, $231.50, want breakdown,\u201d gives the case number is there a little notation off to the side here saying, \u201cPhotographs, ten at $3.50, $35 AR\u201d which I assume is accident report, \u201c$3, WR,\u201d which I assume is Westchester report, \u201c$6, JMH,\u201d which I assume is Jackson Memorial Hospital, \u201c$5.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b498-8\">Giving us a total of $49.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-9\">Then underneath that is another entry for $75 giving us a total entry of $124.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-10\">Then underneath that, Miss Abrams, is another entry wherein you put down the amount of costs, $231.50 and you subtract that amount you have up here, $124 to arrive at another figure.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-11\">Could you please tell me what you were doing there?</p>\n<p id=\"b498-12\">A.26 It looks like I was subtracting $124 from $231.50.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-13\">Q.27 Why would you be doing that?</p>\n<p id=\"b498-14\">You testified, when you made up the amount of costs, you would just go to these various places and get all the costs and add them up and arrive at a cost.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-15\">. Why would you be subtracting $124 from what the total cost is listed on the sheet?</p>\n<p id=\"b498-16\">Why wouldn\u2019t you be adding up all the costs?</p>\n<p id=\"b498-17\">A.27 Well, <em>I don\u2019t remember.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b498-18\">\n<em>I don\u2019t know what I was doing.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b498-19\">\n<em>I can\u2019t remember what I was doing there.</em>\n</p>\n<p

explain this?</p>\n<p id=\"b498-23\">A.28 I know I did subtract it.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-24\">Q.29 You\u2019re the bookkeeper.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-25\">Can you think of any reason you would be doing it that way?</p>\n<p id=\"b498-26\">A.29 <em>I really don\u2019t remember.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b498-27\">I know I was subtracting it but\u2014 ******</p>\n<p id=\"b498-28\">Q.30 (By Ms. Lyons) So you\u2019re saying Mr. Hallen brought this bill into your office; is that right?</p>\n<p id=\"b498-29\">A.30 <em>I think he did.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b498-30\">******</p>\n<p id=\"b498-31\">Q.31 Now, this is a bill for services dated May 17, 1973.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-32\">Now it\u2019s listed in the name of Worldwide Detective Agency.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-33\">Who would the check have been made to?</p>\n<p id=\"b498-34\">A.31 Dave Hallen.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-35\">Q.32 Were all bills from Worldwide Detective Agency paid to Dave Hallen directly?</p>\n<p id=\"b498-36\">A.32 Yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-37\">******</p>\n<p id=\"b498-38\">Q.33 (By Ms. Lyons) Miss Abrams, when you got this request from the Florida Bar for a breakdown on the Yva Henry case, isn\u2019t it true that you went back through your books to try and find the check that had been written to someone in an amount you could fill in the blanks on this and thus justify the cost of $131.50?</p>\n<p id=\"b498-39\">A.33 <em>No, I did not.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b498-40\">******</p>\n<p id=\"b498-41\">Q.34 When you figured out the cost, how did you figure out this entry, or whatever it is, in this book, or in this book, that $107.50 of that was attributable to investigation and Yva Henry when it doesn\u2019t say $107.50 is for Dave Hallen?</p>\n<p id=\"b498-42\">A.34 Because his sheet would have it.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-43\">Dave Hallen has always \u2014 almost always supplies bills for his services and he would have cases on that sheet.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-44\">I would post it accordingly as such.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>Q.35 Post it where?</p>\n<p id=\"b499-4\">A.35 On the chart sheet.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">Q.36 So you\u2019re saying that you prepared this amount for the Florida Bar based upon your charge sheet in the Yva Henry case?</p>\n<p id=\"b499-6\">A.36 <em>Yes.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b499-7\">******</p>\n<p id=\"b499-8\">Q.37 Why wouldn\u2019t you have these bills in your file until April 2, 1974 and why wouldn\u2019t the cost be incurred until April 2, 1974 if his investigation was allegedly done in May of 1973?</p>\n<p id=\"b499-9\">Didn\u2019t you direct to have these photographs prepared at that time when this inquiry from the Florida Bar come about?</p>\n<p id=\"b499-10\">A.37 I didn\u2019t.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-11\">I never directed Dave Hallen to do anything, the attorneys would.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-12\">Q.38 Did the attorney do that in this case?</p>\n<p id=\"b499-13\">A.38 Not to my knowledge, no.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-14\">Q.39 Didn\u2019t these bills just appear in the file after that call from the Florida Bar?</p>\n<p id=\"b499-15\">A.39 <em>I know that the bills were Dave

We have, however, gleaned from the record that at the time when Abrams took over \u00abs Davis\u2019 bookkeeper, Davis\u2019 accountant was keeping tabs on costs disbursed in behalf of clients through the use of cost cards which he personally maintained. From these cost cards, Abrams would prepare closing statements, pay bills, etc. She ultimately instituted a system of \u201ccharge\u201d or \u201ccost\u201d sheets on which she (as opposed to the accountant) would enter various costs for each client as they were incurred. According to Davis, charge sheets were kept separate from the file. The cost sheet for the Henry case was missing during the grand jury hearing and at trial and nothing in the record explains its unavailability.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-34\">The grand jury testimony given to the jury additionally disclosed one other method of keeping track of costs chargeable to clients. The accountant maintained a journal on which Davis checks made out by Abrams in payment of each client\u2019s bills for costs were entered by the accountant. The journal sheet for Yva Henry, not made an exhibit at the Abrams trial, showed $150, not $231.50, in costs. This $150 amount did not include checks issued to Dr. Fox for the two conferences as the following grand jury testimony demonstrates:</p>\n<p id=\"b486-35\">Q. When such conferences are billed to a client, would Dr. Fox be paid for such a conference?</p>\n<p id=\"b486-36\">A. Yes, he would.</p>\n<p id=\"AMi\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>Q. How would he be paid?</p>\n<p id=\"Ahh\">A. By check.</p>\n<p id=\"ABb\">Q.

Because this contention was made in the briefs and pressed so earnestly at oral argument, we checked the trial record in the Davis-Fox case, now on appeal in this Circuit. The indictment alleges a scheme and artifice to defraud and for obtaining money and property by means of false and fraudulent pretenses, representations and promises, from various insurance carriers, <em>accident victims, and the Florida Bar. </em>The alleged objects of the scheme were to (a) induce accident victims to institute claims against insurance carriers and to induce the carriers to pay claims to the defendants and their clients by submitting false and inflated medical bills; (b) <em>reduce payments to accident victims by deducting false and inflated medical bills and costs from the total amount of their </em>settlements; and (c) <em>defraud the Florida Bar from conducting legitimate inquiries into matters raised by clients of Davis by preparing and submitting to the Florida Bar false and inf\u00edated justifications for cost. </em>Two of the false and fraudulent statements and representations cited in Count I of the Davis-Fox indictment were the breakdown submitted to the Florida Bar (Count III of the Abrams indictment) and the court reporter charges listed in the Eduardo Valdez case (Count II of the Abrams indictment, Section I-B infra). Counsel for Abrams stated, <em>inter alia, </em>at oral argument, \u201cIn fact, Counts II and III which we\u2019re here on really didn\u2019t deal with the same issues that the grand jury was investigating. . . . The statements and the questions and the answers which the government has alleged to be perjurious are not material, were not material to the grand jury\u2019s investigation because they really didn\u2019t deal with the issue of insurance fraud per se but rather it was a separate matter involving the client and the attorney.\u201d Any doubts as to materiality that we may have entertained because of these arguments and our ignorance of the true facts have been completely dispelled by our study of the Davis-Fox indictment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"50\">\n<p id=\"b491-7\">.

We have had three other hearings. J urged you <em>all of the time to give me the cases upon which you rely so I can make an investigation. You spring a thing like this on me at the last moment. </em>The motion is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"ABU\">At two o\u2019clock, start putting on your case. MR. HIRSCHHORN: If I might, Judge, with all due respect\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"Af_\">THE COURT: <em>With all due respect to this court, it seems to me that you ought to abide by the rulings of the court and when I asked you to give me your decisions and your authorities, you ought to do it. That would really give your client a break because then if you have a good point, I would have been able to check it. </em>MR. HIRSCHHORN: Judge, as a practical matter, with all due respect, there is a tactical decision I have made in this case on the point I was about to argue. I don\u2019t car.e to give the government the benefit of my theory of the defense. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m required to under the Fifth Amendment. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m required to\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"AV0\">THE COURT: The motion is denied, Mr. Hirschhorn. You will be here at two o\u2019clock.</p>\n<p id=\"AsqR\">Who are you going to call as your witnesses?</p>\n<p id=\"AIc\">MR. HIRSCHHORN: Your Honor may I just give the court one case to read?</p>\n<p id=\"A3bu\">THE COURT: I\u2019m not going to be able to read it now, Mr. Hirschhorn. I have to eat. I have to work on the case.</p>\n<p id=\"A-G\">MR. HIRSCHHORN: I\u2019m going to work on the case too. I\u2019m not going to eat.</p>\n<p id=\"AIk\">THE COURT: Tell me who your first witness is going to be?</p>\n<p id=\"AXs\">MR. HIRSCHHORN: I\u2019m not certain.</p>\n<p id=\"Aqx\">THE COURT: <em>You are not going to call any witnesses are you?</em></p>\n<p id=\"AJD\">MR. HIRSCHHORN: I\u2019m not certain whether I will or not.</p>\n<p id=\"A0v\">THE COURT: Two o\u2019clock.</p>\n<p id=\"A7\">MR. HIRSCHHORN: If the court please, may I give the case to your clerk?</p>\n<p id=\"AT5\">THE COURT: <em>Yes. I don\u2019t like to be kidded, Mr. Hirschhorn. I didn\u2019t believe you were going to put on your witnesses in the first place. You put down Mr. Davis. You are not going to call him.</em></p>\n<p id=\"Arq\">MR. HIRSCHHORN: He\u2019s been subpoenaed, Your Honor.</p>\n<p id=\"Ayp\">THE COURT: The court will be in recess until 2:00 p. m.</p>\n<p id=\"AUsO\">Tr. 123-25 (emphasis added). Davis, as noted earlier, did testify for the defense.</p>\n<p id=\"AN2\">This colloquy took place after the jury retired:</p>\n<p id=\"AOi\">MR. HIRSCHHORN: Your Honor, I have a couple of matters in anticipation of an adverse verdict. First, I respectfully request the maximum time allowable within which to file a motion for new trial and renew motions under 29(c).</p>\n<p id=\"A4eb\">THE COURT: <em>She will be in jaii anyway. </em>It wouldn\u2019t make any difference. You can have as much time as you want.</p>\n<p id=\"Aiq\">MR. HIRSCHHORN: The second issue, Judge, in the event there is a guilty verdict, will the court remand her at that time?</p>\n<p id=\"A52\">THE COURT: I think so.</p>\n<p id=\"AZy\">MR. HIRSCHHORN: Well, there is no risk of flight here.</p>\n<p id=\"AN7\">THE COURT: I don\u2019t know whether there is or not. What does the government say? I think there is.</p>\n<p id=\"A8o\">MR. HIRSCHHORN: I might say, Judge, it will be the second time in six years of my Federal criminal cases I have had a defendant remanded pending a presentence.</p>\n<p id=\"Ar5\">THE COURT: <em>Mr. Hirschhorn, you\u2019re not running this court.</em></p>\n<p id=\"AWX\">MR. HIRSCHHORN: I know.</p>\n<p id=\"AOE\">THE COURT: I just want to let you know that.</p>\n<p id=\"Aat\">MR. HIRSCHHORN: I\u2019m well aware of that.</p>\n<p id=\"AY-\">THE COURT: <em>Apparently you have been trying to all of the time.</em></p>\n<p id=\"ARe\">MR. HIRSCHHORN: Well, I am well aware of that. That\u2019s why I asked the government first. In fact, I told the government you would probably remand her. But I would like to have a hearing on the issue of whether remand is really necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"AMm\">THE COURT: We will have it in the next few days. <em>I will order the defendant taken into custody right now pending the return of the verdict. I don\u2019t want you to start trying to push me around. I don\u2019t like that, Mr. Hirschhorn.</em></p>\n<p id=\"Aqp\">Tr. 222-24 (emphasis added).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"60\">\n<p id=\"b494-43\">. The following are typical examples.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-44\">(1) When defense counsel asked for a short recess to discuss a stipulation (at that time the parties were awaiting the arrival of government witnesses), the Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-45\">Remember I asked you to do that in advance of the trial. There are twelve people here waiting. We are going to take a recess. This is the last time we are going to do it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ab8\">Tr. 20.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-48\">(2) When defense counsel asked for Jencks material, the court stated, \u201cYou were supposed to be here at seven o\u2019clock this morning and pick that up.\u201d Tr. 57. Apparently the Court was unaware that counsel had arranged to meet and exchange this material at a more ordinary hour the day before, at which time <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>some documents had inadvertently been omitted.</p>\n<p id=\"AyP\">(3) This exchange occurred during the examination of Mr. Gross of the Florida Bar:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AR0\">Q You said it is not unusual to get hundreds of these complaints?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AnL\">A I get hundreds of complaints.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AER\">Q From clients who think it is unfair that lawyers\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AK2\">A That\u2019s right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A8R\">Q Who handle their cases on a contingency basis and wind up getting as much or more than they do?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AAE\">A Well, I don\u2019t know.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AfK\">THE COURT: How is that going to prove or disprove any issue in this case? What is the relevancy of that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AY4\">MR. HIRSCHHORN: I didn\u2019t hear the government object.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AzQr\">THE COURT: That doesn\u2019t give you the privilege of asking irrelevant questions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ADf\">MR. HIRSCHHORN: I have a theory in the case. I believe it is relevant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A3x\">THE COURT: Tell me the theory of the case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A0a\">MR. HIRSCHHORN: Judge, I believe that the government \u2014 the jury is entitled to know, this is not an isolated incident involving one particular lawyer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AqpX\">THE COURT: That doesn\u2019t make any difference. That has absolutely no relevancy on whether this woman committed perjury or not. This is what we are here to determine, whether she was asked certain questions and whether she wilfully told falsehoods. That is the issue in this case. It is not the question of whether the lawyers or doctors overcharged or whether they engaged in ambulance chasing or anything else. The question here is whether this woman committed perjury.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ApX\">Tr. 68-69.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"61\">\n<p id=\"b495-30\">. <em>Candelaria-Gonzalez </em>is silent as to whether such curative instructions were given.
