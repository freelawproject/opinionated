The appellant paid a portion of the assessment and brought suit in the District Court for a refund of that amount and an abatement of the remainder of the assessment. The government asserted a counterclaim for the unpaid balance.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-8\">The deficiency assessment was based upon the Commissioner\u2019s determination that the drivers of the vans qualified as the taxpayer\u2019s employees under the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954. The taxpayer argued below, as before this court, that the two long distance drivers were independent contractors, not employees, and therefore, that he is not liable for federal employment taxes. The District Court found in favor of the government, and the taxpayer appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-9\">Because the District Court\u2019s judgment turns upon an issue of fact, the standard of review to be applied by this court is one of clear error. The issue presented on appeal, therefore, is whether the District Court clearly erred in its determination that the two drivers were, in fact, the appellant\u2019s employees. We find that it did not.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-10\">The trial court recognized that the determination of an individual\u2019s status as employee or independent contractor for tax purposes is based on \u201cthe usual common law rules applicable in determining the employer-employee relationship.\u201d 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3121(d)(2) (Internal Revenue Code). Thereupon, it applied accepted common law factors considered relevant to a determination of an employment relationship to the facts of the case. <em>See Avis Rent-A-Car System, Inc. v. United States, </em>503 F.2d 423 (2nd Cir. 1974). This court, recognizing the trial court\u2019s primary responsibility to make such a factual determination, finds and concludes that there was no clear error in this analysis, and the judgment of the District Court is therefore affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
