The class IWA sought to represent included all black persons presently employed at appellee\u2019s Crossett facilities, as well as those black persons who might gain or seek such employment in the future.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-19\">Shortly before IWA filed its complaint, several of its black members filed a class action under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981 and 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e <em>et seq. </em>on behalf of those black persons who were employed, had been employed, had sought employment, or might seek employment at Georgia-Pacific\u2019s Crossett facilities. Both Georgia-Pacific and IWA were named as defendants and charged with engaging in racially discriminatory employment practices. Before the time for a responsive pleading had elapsed, IWA was voluntarily dismissed as a defendant. The two actions were then consolidated.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-20\">Subsequently, Georgia-Pacific moved for a determination that the class be limited to those who were employed, had been employed, had sought employment, and might seek employment at Georgia-Pacific\u2019s <em>plywood </em>operation in Crossett.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The motion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>for class determination was supported by an affidavit. IWA opposed the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-4\">In an unpublished memorandum opinion and order the district court found that IWA could not fairly and adequately represent the class because it had been a defendant in the early stages of the litigation. The district court then limited the class in accordance with Georgia-Pacific\u2019s motion for class determination and named the individual plaintiffs as the class representatives. IWA\u2019s complaint was dismissed on the ground that the class would be better represented by the individual plaintiffs. The district court then \u201crealigned\u201d IWA as a party defendant because of the possible effect that a grant of relief could have on the Georgia-Pacific/IWA collective bargaining agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">IWA has appealed from the judgment entered on the district court\u2019s order of dismissal. The primary issue on appeal is whether IWA has standing to maintain an action against Georgia-Pacific seeking remedies for discrimination against the employees IWA represents at Georgia-Pacific\u2019s plywood, chemical, and forestry facilities in Crossett, Arkansas. A subsidiary, but important, question is whether the district court was justified in dismissing IWA\u2019s class claim without taking any evidence regarding the right and capacity of IWA to serve as a Rule 23 class representative. We \u25a0vacate the order dismissing IWA\u2019s complaint and remand the cause for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b136-7\">Provided the court has jurisdiction, a litigant\u2019s individual claim survives the determination that he cannot maintain his action as the representative of a class under Fed.R.Civ.P. 23. <em>See Harris v. Palm Springs Alpine Estates, </em>329 F.2d 909, 913 (9th Cir. 1964); 3B Moore\u2019s Federal Practice \u00b6 23.97, at 1951 (2d ed. 1977). In the case at bar, the district court determined that IWA could not fairly and adequately represent the class and then dismissed IWA\u2019s action. But regardless of the requirements of Fed.R.Civ.P. 23,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> unless IWA had no standing to sue in its representative capacity, the district court erred in dismissing IWA\u2019s complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-11\">The question of whether an unincorporated association such as IWA has standing to sue as the representative of its members was settled by the Supreme Court in <em>Warth v. Seldin, </em>422 U.S. 490, 511, 95 S.Ct. 2197, 2211-12, 45 L.Ed.2d 343 (1975):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b136-12\">Even in the absence of injury to itself, an association may have standing solely as the representative of its members. . The association must allege that its members, or any one of them, are suffering immediate or threatened injury as a result of the challenged action of the sort that would make out a justiciable case had the members themselves brought suit, (citations omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b136-14\">Absent the assignment of the damages claims of its members or the allegation of monetary injury to itself, an association may only seek injunctive or declaratory relief, however. <em>Id. </em>at 515-16, 95 S.Ct. 2197.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-15\">The complaint filed by IWA alleges sufficient facts to indicate that its members working in Georgia-Pacific\u2019s plywood, chemical, and forestry facilities have been harmed by the company\u2019s racially discriminatory policies. It is clear that, under <em>Warth, </em>IWA has standing to sue in its representational capacity.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-16\">In addition, it appears that there are no legislative limitations on IWA\u2019s standing. Under Title VII, a suit alleging discrimination can be brought by any \u201cperson claiming to be aggrieved.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(a), (e). Labor unions are expressly included in the definition of \u201cperson.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e(a). The EEOC has determined that labor unions may be \u201cpersons aggrieved\u201d under the statute and that determination <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>has received judicial recognition. <em>International Chemical Workers Union </em>v. <em>Planters Manufacturing Co., </em>259 F.Supp. 365, 366-68 (N.D.Miss.1966). Moreover, the legislative history of the 1972 amendments to Title VII indicates Congress\u2019 intent that unions have standing to sue as \u201cpersons aggrieved.\u201d S.Rep.No.92-A15, 92nd Cong., 1st Sess. 27 n.16, <em>reprinted in </em>U.S. Senate Committee on Labor and Public Welfare, Legislative History of the Equal Employment Opportunity Act of 1972, at 436 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">Finally, policy considerations weigh strongly in favor of affording standing to unions which file suit to end discriminatory employment practices. The financial backing and legal expertise that unions can provide would materially advance the type of private enforcement essential to the effectiveness of Title VII. <em>Local 194, Retail, Wholesale &amp; Department Store Union </em>v. <em>Standard Brands, </em>540 F.2d 864, 866 (7th Cir. 1976); <em>see IUE v. Westinghouse Electric Corp., </em>73 F.R.D. 57, 59 (W.D.N.Y.1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b137-6\">We conclude that IWA has standing to sue as the representative of its members employed in the forestry, plywood, and chemical facilities of Georgia-Pacific at Crossett, Arkansas, at least insofar as injunctive relief is sought. Therefore, it was error for the district court to dismiss IWA\u2019s complaint since IWA\u2019s representational claim survived the determination that its class action could not proceed.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b137-8\">Our resolution of the standing question requires reversal of the district court\u2019s order dismissing IWA\u2019s action. There remains the question of whether the district court properly determined that IWA could not fairly and adequately represent the class of persons who are employed, have been employed, have sought employment, or might seek employment at Georgia-Pacific\u2019s plywood facility in Crossett, Arkansas.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-9\">The district court\u2019s determination of IWA\u2019s inadequacy as a class representative was premised solely on IWA\u2019s brief tenure as a defendant in the early stages of the litigation, despite the voluntary dismissal of the claim against IWA prior to a responsive pleading. The district court acted without holding a hearing or taking evidence regarding any of the factors normally requisite to a determination of the fairness and adequacy of class representation. <em>See </em>3B Moore\u2019s Federal Practice \u00b6 23.07[1], at 23-352-53 (2d ed. 1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b137-11\">We cannot countenance the district court\u2019s procedure in this case. As this court recently noted in a similar context:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-12\">The propriety of class action status can seldom be determined .on the basis of the pleadings alone. . . . The District Court must have before it \u201csufficient material ... to determine the nature of the allegations, and rule on compliance with the Rule\u2019s requirements . . . .\u201d Securing this material does not always require a formal evidentiary hearing. . Where, however, the pleadings themselves do not conclusively show whether the Rule 23 requirements are met, the parties must be afforded the opportunity to discover and present documentary evidence on the issue, (citations omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b137-16\"><em>Walker v. World Tire Corp., </em>563 F.2d 918, 921 (8th Cir., 1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b137-17\">Georgia-Pacific contends that IWA can never adequately represent the class because of a supposedly inherent conflict of interest between the white members of IWA and the alleged discriminatees. In effect, Georgia-Pacific urges that we hold, as a matter of law, that a racially-mixed union cannot be an adequate representative of the class of its black members. This we decline to do.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-18\">We recognize that certain difficulties may arise when a union seeks to represent a class consisting of only some of its members. <em>See, e. g., Local 194, Retail, Wholesale &amp; Department Store Union v. Standard Brands, supra; Air Line Stewards &amp; Stewardesses Ass\u2019n, Local 550 v. American Air Lines, Inc., </em>490 F.2d 636 (7th Cir. 1973); <em>Compare Lynch v. Sperry Rand Corp., </em>62 F.R.D. 78 (S.D.N.Y.1973) <em>with Thompson v. Board of Education, </em>71 F.R.D. 398 (W.D. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>Mich.1976). On remand, IWA may encounter such difficulties and find them insurmountable. But on the meager record before this court, it would be imprudent for us to address and attempt to resolve the potential problems of the present litigation. Therefore, we hold only that the district court failed to properly consider IWA\u2019s request to represent the class herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-4\">The order of the district court dismissing IWA\u2019s action must be, and is, reversed. The cause is remanded with directions to reinstate IWA\u2019s action and allow IWA to maintain its representational claims on behalf of its members employed in Georgia-Pacific\u2019s plywood, forestry, and chemical facilities at Crossett, Arkansas.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The court shall also take evidence and grant the parties an opportunity to be heard on whether IWA can fairly and adequately represent the class determined by the district court, and afford such relief as may be just and proper.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b135-21\">. Georgia-Pacific\u2019s Crossett facilities include plywood, chemical, forestry, particleboard, panelboard, tissue, pulp, bag, extrusion, kraft paper, and foodboard operations.</p>\n<p id=\"AoH\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>IWA represents workers in the plywood, chemical, and forestry operations.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b136-9\">. It was unnecessary for IWA to meet the requirements of Fed.R.Civ.P. 23 in order to sue representationally. <em>Local 194, Retail, Wholesale &amp; Department Store Union v. Standard Brands, </em>540 F.2d 864, 867 (7th Cir. 1976).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b138-10\">. Inasmuch as IWA has alleged and is claiming that Georgia-Pacific is engaging in discriminatory conduct against its black employees, represented by IWA, at the forestry and chemical facilities in Crossett, Arkansas, logic and judicial economy dictate that this charge should be litigated and fully ventilated along with the action focused on the claimed discrimination at Georgia-Pacific\u2019s plywood operation.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"rehearing\">\n<p id=\"b138-5\">ON PETITION FOR REHEARING OR MODIFICATION</p>\n<author id=\"b138-6\">PER CURIAM.</author>\n<p id=\"b138-7\">Georgia-Pacific Corporation has filed a petition for \u201crehearing or a modification of a portion\u201d of our opinion filed on December 16, 1977.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-8\">Georgia-Pacific has apparently read our opinion as a mandate to the district court to consolidate the claims of IWA that discrimination is being practiced in the forestry and chemical operations of Georgia-Pacific, as well as at its plywood operation in Crossett, Arkansas.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-9\">Careful consideration of that portion of our opinion dealing with the right of IWA to represent its members at the three operations refutes the apparent view of Georgia-Pacific. The district court, in its discretion, may order a separate trial of the claim of alleged discrimination at the plywood operation, and our opinion should not be interpreted as an absolute mandate that the issue of discrimination at all three operations must be tried together. <em>See </em>Fed.R. Civ.P. 42(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b138-12\">The petition for rehearing or modification is denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
