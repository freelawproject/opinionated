One of the obligations imposed sales performance levels or quotas on plaintiff \u201cconditioned upon the [defendant\u2019s] prompt shipment of goods based on orders submitted by the [plaintiff] distributor to the [defendant] company.\u201d Plaintiff alleged that during the months of October, November and December 1971 defendant did not promptly ship goods to plaintiff as required by the agreement and yet terminated the agreement on January 25, 1972, for the reason that plaintiff had failed to meet its quotas. In Count I, plaintiff sought $2,500,000 in damages for breach of contract under Wisconsin law.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1220-4\">Count II was brought under Section 1 of the Sherman Act (15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1). Plaintiff alleged that defendant had violated that statute by limiting its wholesale distributors\u2019 sales of defendant\u2019s wines and brandies to prescribed geographical sales territories. Defendant assertedly terminated plaintiff on January 25,1972, because plaintiff refused to confine its sales to its prescribed territories. Plaintiff claimed damages of $2,575,000 (before trebling) under Count II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1220-5\">Count III of the amended complaint was brought to vindicate defendant\u2019s alleged violations of Sections 2(d) and 2(e) of the Robinson-Patman Act (15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 13(d) and 13(e)). According to this Count, from August 1971 to January 1972 the defendant shipped goods more promptly to plaintiff\u2019s competitors than to plaintiff and granted them promotional allowances and services and facilities not available to plaintiff. For these violations of the Robinson-Patman Act plaintiff sought $2,500,000 (before trebling).</p>\n<p id=\"b1220-7\">In its answer to Count I of the amended complaint, defendant denied that it breached the October 1, 1970, agreement with plaintiff, on the ground that said agreement provided for termination of plaintiff for its failure to meet quotas set by that agreement. As to Count II, defendant denied that it had imposed geographical sales territories on plaintiff and its competitors. As an affirmative defense to Count II, defendant charged that (1) plaintiff was <em>in pari delicto ; (2) </em>plaintiff was estopped because it had realized and accepted the benefits of the restrictions; and (3) plaintiff\u2019s claim was barred by the four-year statute of limitations (15 U.S.C. \u00a7 15b). With respect to Count III, defendant denied that it violated Sections 2(d) and 2(e) of the Robinson-Patman Act and reiterated the <em>in pari delicto, </em>estoppel and statute of limitations defenses asserted in Count II. Defendant also filed a counterclaim consisting of five causes of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b1220-8\">In June 1975, the district judge denied plaintiff's motion to strike defendant\u2019s affirmative defenses and denied plaintiff\u2019s motion to dismiss defendant\u2019s second, third, fourth and fifth counterclaims.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On July 29, 1976, plaintiff sought to file a proposed second amended complaint<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> but leave was denied a month later because of \u201cno need to amend.\u201d The jury trial commenced three weeks thereafter.</p>\n<p id=\"b1220-9\">Although the district judge initially indicated that he would grant plaintiff\u2019s motion for a directed verdict on \u201cthat part of Count III which alleges * * * discriminatory promotional allowances\u201d (Tr. 925) and that he would grant a motion for a directed verdict ,for the plaintiff on what appears to be only the issue of the territorial restrictions in Count II (Tr. 929-933), he eventually declined to grant those motions; we agree with that ultimate resolution.

This judgment consisted of the $500,000 jury verdict for plaintiff, trebled pursuant to 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 15 to $1,500,-000. This amount was reduced by $156,-062.48 pursuant to the jury verdict for defendant on its first counterclaim, plus interest, for a total of $192,598.25. Subsequently, the district judge awarded plaintiff costs of $3,394.50 and attorneys\u2019 fees of $127,-564.98. We reverse and remand for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"AkV-\">1. <em>The Instructions on Territorial Restrictions</em></p>\n<p id=\"AEg\">About eight months after the conclusion of the jury trial, the Supreme Court handed down <em>Continental T.V., Inc. </em>v. <em>GTE Sylvania, Inc., </em>433 U.S. 36, 97 S.Ct. 2549, 53 L.Ed.2d 568 holding that territorial restrictions are not illegal <em>per se </em>under the Sherman Act, thus overruling <em>United States </em>v. <em>Arnold Schwinn &amp; Company, </em>388 U.S. 365, 87 S.Ct. 1856, 18 L.Ed.2d 1249. We are of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1152\">*1152</page-number>course required to decide this case on the basis of existing law rather than according to the law that existed at the time of the decision below. <em>United States v. Schooner Peggy, </em>5 U.S. (1 Cranch.) 103, 109, 2 L.Ed. 49; <em>Bradley v. Richmond School Board, </em>416 U.S. 696, 94 S.Ct. 2006, 40 L.Ed.2d 476; <em>Hamling v. United States, </em>418 U.S. 87, 102, 94 S.Ct. 2887, 41 L.Ed.2d 590.</p>\n<p id=\"b1222-4\">In the court below, the case was tried and the jury was instructed based on the law in <em>Schwinn. </em>Count II of the amended complaint asserted that defendant\u2019s territorial restrictions violated Section 1 of the Sherman Act, and during the trial plaintiff introduced substantial evidence to prove that defendant attempted to impose territorial restrictions and that the distributorship termination resulted from plaintiff\u2019s refusal to accede to such. During the course of the litigation, plaintiff\u2019s theory was that these territorial restrictions were unlawful <em>per se </em>under <em>Schwinn.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1222-5\">One of the district judge\u2019s instructions to the jury was a <em>Schwinn </em>-type instruction that \u201cterritorial limitations * * * are per se violations of the antitrust laws.\u201d Subsequently he charged the jurors in accord with <em>Schwinn </em>as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1222-6\">\u201cIn this regard, it is unlawful for a producer to terminate one of its distributors for the reason that the distributor objected to or departed from a plan by the producer to allocate or to restrict the territories in which its products could be sold.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1222-7\">Immediately thereafter, the district judge correctly told the jury it is unlawful for a producer to terminate a distributor because of its objections to or departures from the producer\u2019s plan to fix or maintain retail prices and incorrectly told the jury that it would also be unlawful for a producer to terminate a distributor for distributing the products of a competing producer.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Then came the following instruction:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AZ1\">\u201cTermination for any one <em>or </em>more of these [three] reasons is unlawful.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1222-10\">Thus it is seen that the jury may have found defendant guilty of violating the Sherman Act because of territorial restrictions alone, now permissible under the <em>Continental T.V. </em>case unless they violate the long-time rule of reason. To avoid a retrial, plaintiff argues first that defendant cannot challenge the <em>Schwinn </em>instructions because no objection was made to them at trial and, second, that even if a proper objection had been made the instructions should be upheld because <em>Continental T.V. </em>is distinguishable from the facts of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1222-11\">The argument that in order to receive the benefit of a change in the law on appeal a party must have objected to the old law at trial would give effect to the Supreme Court\u2019s now firm principle that an appellate court should apply the law in existence at the time of appeal only in those rare cases in which counsel had the foresight to predict the change. Cf. <em>Carpenter v. Wabash Ry. Co., </em>309 U.S. 23, 29, 60 S.Ct. 416, 84 L.Ed. 558. Not only would plaintiff\u2019s argument thus undermine the clear intention of the Supreme Court but it would also exceed the purposes of requiring an objection at trial: objections are required so that the .trial judge can correct any errors, but given the applicable law at the time he gave the instruction the district judge here committed no error and in fact would have been wrong to instruct that <em>Schwinn </em>was not the law.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Even if, as plaintiff suggests, the appropriate standard is whether defendant\u2019s counsel can be faulted for failing to predict the change in the laws, we decline to find fault on the facts of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1153\">*1153</page-number>this case because of the infrequency with which recent Supreme Court decisions are overruled even when, as here, they have been criticized by some commentators and courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b1223-4\">Plaintiff\u2019s more substantial contention is its attempt to distinguish <em>Continental T.V. </em>on two grounds. First, citing <em>Pitchford Scientific Instruments Corp. v. Pepi, Inc., </em>435 F.Supp. 685 (W.D.Pa.1977), plaintiff argues that <em>Continental T.V. </em>is not controlling because it did not change the rule that vertical territorial restrictions are <em>per se </em>illegal when they are part of a price-fixing scheme. See <em>United States v. Bausch &amp; Lomb Optical Co., </em>321 U.S. 707, 64 S.Ct. 805, 88 L.Ed. 1024. Although this argument may be a fair reading of <em>Continental T.V., </em>it is inapplicable here. Unlike <em>Pitchford, </em>in which the Third Circuit already had found that the evidence in the ease supported a finding of price fixing<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and the district judge found that defendant\u2019s territorial restrictions \u201cwere part and parcel of a comprehensive price-fixing policy,\u201d 435 F.Supp. at 689, this case was not tried on a theory that the restraints \u201cwere ancillary to an illegal price fixing scheme\u201d <em>(Copper Liquor, Inc. v. Adolph Coors Co., </em>506 F.2d 934, 948 (5th Cir. 1975)) and the record is insufficient to support our making such a finding. See Part III, <em>infra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1223-5\">Also based on <em>Pitchford, </em>plaintiff\u2019s second argument is that <em>Continental T.V. </em>is not controlling because it deals only with a \u201c \u2018location\u2019 clause\u201d \u2014 a restriction barring a vendor from selling products from locations other than those specified in the agreements \u2014 and not with an arguably more anti-competitive restriction (such as here) barring the vendor from selling to buyers in certain locations. Judge Dumbauld offered this distinction in <em>Pitchford </em>because Justice Powell, the author of the <em>Continental T.V. </em>opinion, spoke at the beginning only of the location clause and then went on \u201cto say that the <em>Continental T.V. </em>case \u2018presents important questions concerning . . . <em>these </em>restrictions\u2019 [Italics supplied].\u201d 435 F.Supp. at 688, quoting <em>Continental T.V. Inc. v. GTE Sylvania, Inc., supra, </em>433 U.S. at 37, 97 S.Ct. at 2551. However, Justice Powell\u2019s own express limitation of the Court\u2019s holding later in the opinion was not so narrow but rather stated that \u201cwe are concerned here only with non-price vertical restrictions,\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 51 n.18, 97 S. Ct. at 2558 n.18 and the prohibition in <em>Schwinn </em>that was overruled by <em>Continental T. V. </em>was described as \u201cattempting to restrict a \u2018retailer\u2019s freedom as to where <em>and to whom </em>it will resell the products\u2019 \u201d (emphasis added). <em>Id. </em>at 46, 97 S.Ct. at 2555. Still later in the opinion, Justice Powell expressly rejected the distinction that plaintiff asks us to draw: \u201cThe fact that one restriction was addressed to territory and the other to customers is irrelevant to functional antitrust analysis * * * \u201d <em>Ibid.; </em>see also <em>Id. </em>at 58 n.29, 97 S.Ct. at 2562, n.29. That <em>Continental T.V. </em>intended to change the law relating to more than merely location clauses<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> is also clear from the conclusion of the opinion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1223-13\">\u201c[W]e conclude that the <em>per se </em>rule stated in <em>Schwinn </em>must be overruled. In so holding we do not foreclose the possibility that particular applications of vertical restrictions might justify <em>per se </em>prohibition under <em>Northern Pac. R. Co. </em>But we do make clear that departure from the rule of reason standard must be based upon demonstrable economic effect rather than \u2014 as in <em>Schwinn </em>\u2014 upon formalistic line drawing.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 58, 97 S.Ct. at 2562.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1224-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1154\">*1154</page-number>Applying this standard, on the record presented below <em>Continental T.V. </em>mandates that the rule of reason initially apply to the vertical restriction at issue here. The trial court\u2019s instruction therefore was erroneous and constitutes reversible (though unavoidable) error because a territorial restriction was one of the three grounds listed in the instructions as permitting a verdict for plaintiff under Counts II and III. Because this defect in the instructions affects the substantial rights of the defendant, it cannot be considered harmless error under Rule 61 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. On remand, however, plaintiff should be afforded the opportunity to prove that this particular type of vertical restriction justifies <em>per se </em>prohibition \u201cbased upon demonstrable economic effect.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 59, 97 S.Ct. at 2562.</p>\n<p id=\"b1224-4\">II. <em>The Instruction on Termination</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1224-5\">Defendant also contends that the district judge\u2019s attempt to instruct the jury on the duplication of damages resulted in an instruction that improperly allowed the jury to find that the termination of plaintiff\u2019s contract occurred for anti-competitive purposes if defendant was guilty of any antitrust violation. Initially, during an in-chambers conference, in response to the district judge\u2019s concern that the jury might award plaintiff damages both for breach of contract and for termination in violation of the Sherman Act, plaintiff tendered to the court an instruction which is substantially identical to part of the instruction eventually given. As finally given, the instruction read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1224-6\">\u201cNow if you find that the defendant has violated the antitrust laws, if you do find that, then, in effect, you have found that the termination of the plaintiff\u2019s contract occurred for anticompetitive purposes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1224-7\">* * * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1224-8\">\u201cTo put it another way, if the antitrust laws are violated, then it is implied that that contract was breached for anticompetitive purposes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1224-9\">Despite his participation at the conference in formulating the instruction, just before the jury retired defense counsel first objected to this instruction for its failure to tell the jurors that \u201cbefore you determine that the termination of the distributorship contract was in violation of the antitrust laws, you must find that the intended effect of such termination has created unreasonable restraint of trade\u201d (Tr. 1193-1194; see also Tr. 1196).</p>\n<p id=\"b1224-11\">In the opinion accompanying the order denying defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial, the trial court held that defendant had waived this objection by failing to raise it properly under Rule 49(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. However, the waiver provision of Rule 49(a) is inapplicable here because it applies when, in submitting the issues to the jury, the court \u201comits any issue of fact raised by the pleadings or by the evidence.\u201d Defendant\u2019s objection did not request the introduction of a new factual question or even the alteration of the verdict form but rather requested a clarifying instruction about the form and is therefore governed by Rule 51. Cf. <em>McDonnell v. Timmerman, </em>269 F.2d 54, 58 (8th Cir. 1959). Indeed plaintiff recognizes ' that Rule 51 governs (Br. 45, 47) and does not attempt to justify the district judge\u2019s ruling under Rule 49(a) (cf. Br. 39, 48).</p>\n<p id=\"b1224-12\">Under Rule 51 there is no argument that defendant\u2019s objection was not timely, but plaintiff does argue that the defendant is bound by the instruction because the defendant participated in the conference where it was formulated. This argument, however, was rejected by the Fifth Circuit in <em>Alabama Great Southern Railroad Co. v. Johnson, </em>140 F.2d 968, 972 (5th Cir. 1944), and the result reached in that case has been accepted by the principal commentators. See 9 Wright and Miller, <em>Federal Practice and Procedure </em>\u00a7 2558; 5A Moore\u2019s <em>Federal Practice </em>\u00b6 51.05. Plaintiff further argues that when read in context the instruction could not be interpreted by the jury to require a finding of anti-competitive termination if they found defendant guilty of any antitrust violation. If the challenged instruction were in the middle of several contrary instructions this argument <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1155\">*1155</page-number>might have merit, but since this instruction came at the tail-end of the court\u2019s charge, it cannot be said that it was cured by prior correct instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1225-5\">Even plaintiff does not argue that the instruction as given properly states the law. As defendant\u2019s counsel put it, the basis for the objection is that under such an instruction, \u201cthe jury could find under the evidence that a violation of the antitrust laws occurred without also finding that the contract was terminated for anti-competitive reasons\u201d (Defendant\u2019s App. 53). The trial court conceded this interpretation was possible in its decision denying defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial (Defendant\u2019s App. 22; Plaintiff\u2019s Br. 39). Although improper purpose need not be proven if the specific offense charged is <em>per se </em>illegal, when the specific offense is not illegal <em>per se </em>we have been presented with no authority for conclusively implying improper purpose only from the fact that possibly <em>per se </em>offenses are also charged. See <em>Copper Liquor, Inc. </em>v. <em>Adolph Coors Co., supra. </em>At the next trial, such an instruction must be omitted and the verdict form should be redrawn to avoid the problem.</p>\n<p id=\"b1225-6\">III. <em>Miscellaneous Contentions of Parties</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1225-7\">Despite the fact that it never moved at trial for a directed verdict on all its claims, apparently recognizing the errors in the jury instructions discussed <em>supra, </em>plaintiff argues that the jury verdict is unnecessary to support the judgment because plaintiff was entitled to a directed verdict that the defendant violated the antitrust laws on each of the following issues: defendant\u2019s resale price restrictions, defendant\u2019s termination of plaintiff and defendant\u2019s discriminatory price allowances.</p>\n<p id=\"b1225-8\">[\u00b6] Given the strict standards that must be met before a case can be taken away from the jury (see <em>Hohmann v. Packard Instrument Company, Inc., </em>471 F.2d 815, 819 (7th Cir. 1973)), a directed verdict on the resale price restrictions issue would have been improper if requested because plaintiff\u2019s case (apart from evidence that must be viewed as barred by an October 1, 1970, release, at least in the absence of a contrary finding below) is based not on defendant\u2019s insistence upon any specific prices but rather on inferences that a jury might draw from language in generalized pricing discussions and from certain possibly unrelated actions by the defendant such as the monitoring of advertisements and invoices. Such inferences cannot support a directed Sherman Act verdict on a resale price maintenance theory.</p>\n<p id=\"b1225-10\">Nor would a directed verdict have been proper if requested on the question whether the termination of plaintiff violated Section 1 of the Sherman Act. A jury reasonably could have found that the termination was in response to a declining sales record even though plaintiff remained defendant\u2019s largest single distributor, or in response to plaintiff\u2019s selling brands of competing suppliers. Because the purpose of the termination is unclear and because plaintiff\u2019s evidence of the effect of defendant\u2019s conduct on an individual distributor is not conclusive on the issue of anti-competitive effect (see <em>Brown Shoe Co. v. United States, </em>370 U.S. 294, 320, 82 S.Ct. 1502, 8 L.Ed.2d 510), the termination issue was properly left to the jury. We also agree with the district judge\u2019s decision not to grant a directed verdict on the RobinsonPatman Act issues because certain defenses are available under Sections 2(d) and 2(e) thereof and plaintiff would still have to show damages and causal connection.</p>\n<p id=\"b1225-11\">Defendant asserts that the instructions did not discuss anti-competitive purpose, causal connection and conduct tainted by a contract and conspiracy, but our study of the court\u2019s charge indicates that it was replete as to each such subject. We imply no view on contentions of the parties not expressly discussed in this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1225-12\">Plaintiff did not cross-appeal as to the $192,598.25 judgment against it on defendant\u2019s first counterclaim, so that said judgment must stand. The judgment for plaintiff is reversed and remanded for new trial.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1220-6\">.

Probably because of <em>Tampa Electric Co. v. Nashville Coal Co., </em>365 U.S. 320, 81 S.Ct. 623, 5 L.Ed.2d 580, plaintiff concedes that this instruction was overly broad (Br. 49), but since defendant gave no ground for its objection to this instruction as required by Rule 51 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, we will not consider this as reversible error. However, it should be cured on remand.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1222-12\">. Although <em>GTE Sylvania v. Continental T.V., Inc., </em>537 F.2d 980 (9th Cir. 1976; <em>en banc), </em>was decided (with four dissenting judges) six months before this trial, <em>Schwinn </em>was still the law in the Seventh Circuit and in all the other federal circuits.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b1223-6\">. <em>Pitchford </em>v. <em>Pepi, </em>531 F.2d 92, 98 (3d Cir. 1976).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b1223-7\">. Justice White\u2019s concurring opinion as well as the opinion of the Ninth Circuit in note 7 <em>supra </em>both indicate that this reading of Justice Powell\u2019s majority opinion is correct. The concurrence attacks the majority opinion for failing to distinguish <em>Continental T.V. </em>from <em>Schwinn </em>as the Ninth Circuit did on the ground that the location clause in <em>Continental T.V. </em>was less intrusive than the \u201csystem of vertical restraints\u201d in <em>Schwinn. </em>433 U.S. at 58-59, 97 S.Ct. 2562-2563 (White, J., concurring). The majority, however, found no \u201cprincipled basis for distinguishing <em>Schwinn </em>* * <em>Id. </em>at 46, 97 S.Ct. at 2556. Put simply, if the majority had intended that location clauses were to be viewed differently from other systems of vertical restraints, it could have distinguished <em>Schwinn </em>instead of overruling it.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
