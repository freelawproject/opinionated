He charged violations of his civil rights under Title VII, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e <em>et seq., </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981, and, as to the union only, violation of the National Labor Relations Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 151 <em>et seq. </em>After a non-jury trial the district court dismissed the complaint. We affirm for the reasons set forth by the district court in its memorandum opinion, reported at 411 F.Supp. 1167, 1976 N.D.Tex.</p>\n<p id=\"b1168-27\">We think it helpful to add a few words to the district court\u2019s discussion of the National Labor Relations Act contention. Franklin alleged that the union violated the duty of fair representation which it owed him. To constitute such a violation, the union\u2019s actions-must have been arbitrary, discriminatory, or in bad faith. <em>Vaca v. Sipes, </em>1967, 386 U.S. 171, 190, 86 S.Ct. 1863, 16 L.Ed.2d 680. The district court construed the collective bargaining agree<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1099\">*1099</page-number>ment to require a discharged employee to request written reasons for his discharge within 72 hours. Because Franklin failed to do this, the court ruled that the union could not have pressed his grievance under the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b1169-5\">Although the effect of the district court\u2019s construction of the collective bargaining agreement was harsh, in the circumstances of this case we agree with the court\u2019s disposition of the appellant\u2019s argument. Franklin did not complain to the union about his discharge until 43 days after he was fired. The union then discussed his case with the employer. The employer, not the union, cited the 72-hour rule as a bar to consideration of Franklin\u2019s complaint. Both the 43-day delay and the actions undertaken by the union on Franklin\u2019s behalf show that the union\u2019s response was not arbitrary, discriminatory, or in bad faith.</p>\n<p id=\"b1169-6\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
