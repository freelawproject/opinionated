BROWN, Chief Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b1179-25\">A jury convicted Bobby Ray Allen in Texas state court of robbery by assault. Under the Texas habitual offenders statute <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> his sentence was enhanced to life imprisonment. After exhausting state remedies, Allen petitioned the United States District Court for a writ of habeas corpus, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254. On November 9, 1976, with<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1110\">*1110</page-number>out holding an evidentiary hearing, the District Court entered an order denying the writ. On appeal Allen contends (i) that a pretrial showup confrontation was so suggestive as to cause a misidentification in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s due process clause, and (ii) that prior convictions were unconstitutionally used to enhance his sentence. We affirm the District Court\u2019s denial of habeas relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b1180-4\">Shortly after 11:00 p.m. on March 13, 1973, two men entered a motel in Abilene, Texas and at gunpoint robbed the motel clerk, Charles C. Burke, taking his watch, wallet, television set, and money from the cash register. The robbers forced Burke into an adjoining room, threatened to kill him, and bound him with tape. Within minutes Burke managed to free himself and to observe his assailants fleeing in a red Thunderbird automobile. Burke then telephoned the police, providing a general description of the robbers, the stolen property, the escape vehicle, and the direction in which the men had fled. A patrol cruiser almost immediately intercepted a car matching Burke\u2019s description, discovered a television set in the back seat, arrested Allen and a companion, and transported the two men to the station house where they were confined in separate cells. The police then notified Burke that they had recovered his stolen merchandise and requested that he come to the station to identify the suspects.</p>\n<p id=\"b1180-5\">Within an hour after the robbery, Burke entered the station house. Inside the station Burke saw his television sitting on a counter. He was taken to the detectives\u2019 quarters where he apparently remained for 15 to 30 minutes. An officer then led Burke downstairs into a restricted hall for the stated purpose of identifying the suspects. Once downstairs it is unclear exactly what transpired.</p>\n<p id=\"b1180-9\">The suspects were apparently removed from their cells and, without being told anything, were taken for one suspect lineups (showups) in the hallway. The officer in charge of the investigation admitted that the police had no intention whatsoever of constructing a lineup. Allen was escorted by a policeman into the hall where he confronted Burke. According to Burke, the suspects were brought separately into the hallway. The officer in charge asked Burke whether he recognized anyone in the hall and Burke responded on each occasion by identifying both men as his assailants. While it is unclear exactly how many persons were in the hallway at the time, it is known that only authorized police personnel were permitted in this area.</p>\n<p id=\"b1180-10\">In his pretrial Motion to Suppress In-Court Identification, Allen complained that \u201cany In-Court Identification made by the complaining party, Charles Burke, is and would be impermissibly suggested to the complaining party by this out of court confrontation and therefore would not be admissible as an In-Court Identification even if the complaining party should testify that this were an independent recollection because of the impermissibly suggestive lineup and one on one confrontation.\u201d In accord with the practices established within this Circuit,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the state trial judge held a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1111\">*1111</page-number>suppression hearing immediately prior to trial with no jury present. The purpose of the hearing was to determine whether or not, in the wake of the suggestive showup confrontation, a substantial likelihood of irreparable misidentification existed which would warrant exclusion of any identification made by Burke at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1181-5\">At the suppression hearing Burke was asked to identify his assailants. In an apparent effort to secure a positive response from Burke, the prosecutor stood behind Allen, who was seated at the defense table, and asked Burke whether he recognized Allen as his assailant. Burke then identified Allen stating that his identification was not enhanced by the pretrial confrontation and that he \u201cwouldn\u2019t forget either [suspect] in a hundred years.\u201d Upon further examination Burke stated that he recognized Allen as a hotel guest from the previous night. Burke also testified that upon entering the office at the time of the robbery Allen stated, \u201cI told you I would be back, your beds were so comfortable.\u201d The trial judge concluded that an in-court identification would be admissible as an independent identification untainted by the station house confrontation. At trial Burke made the in-court identification here challenged and the pretrial identification was never admitted before the jury. On direct appeal in an unpublished opinion the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed Allen\u2019s conviction.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Subsequently, under application for habeas relief, the District Court found no due process violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1181-12\">\n<em>The Pretrial Confrontation</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1181-13\">The Supreme Court established the due process standard against which police identification procedures are to be measured in <em>Stovall v. Denno, </em>1967, 388 U.S. 293, 87 S.Ct. 1967, 18 L.Ed.2d 1199. A violation of due process occurs when, under \u201cthe totality of the circumstances,\u201d a confrontation procedure is \u201cunnecessarily suggestive and conducive to irreparable mistaken identification.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Within this Court the due process standard has developed into a bipartite inquiry.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>United States v. Smith, </em>5 Cir., 1977, 546 F.2d 1275; <em>Blood-</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1112\">*1112</page-number><em>worth v. Hopper, </em>5 Cir., 1976, 539 F.2d 1382; <em>United States v. Gidley, </em>5 Cir., 1976, 527 F.2d 1345. First, as a threshold inquiry, the Court must decide whether the identification procedure was unnecessarily suggestive. A finding of impermissible suggestiveness raises concern over the reliability of identification and triggers closer scrutiny by the Court to determine whether such a procedure created a substantial risk of misidentification. <em>United States v. Smith, supra </em>at 1279; <em>United States v. Gidley, supra </em>at 1350.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1182-4\">Undoubtedly, the confrontation procedure utilized by the police in this case was inherently suggestive. As pointed out by the Supreme Court in <em>Stovall,</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1182-5\">\u201c[t]he practice of showing suspects singly to persons for the purpose of identification, and not as part of a lineup, has been widely condemned.\u201d 388 U.S. at 302, 87 S.Ct. at 1972.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1182-6\">This Court, along with other Circuits,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> has shown reluctance to encourage the use of showups. <em>United States v. Abshire, </em>5 Cir., 1972, 471 F.2d 116, 120 (Judge Godbold specially concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b1182-7\">We seek to encourage police activity which will minimize and not aggravate the suggestiveness of identification procedures. Here, as must always be the case, the police should have made an effort to construct a lineup or explain why a lineup could not be constructed. Similarly, the police should avoid unduly influencing witnesses. In the present case Burke was first allowed to see his stolen property. The police also made comments which could only increase Burke\u2019s expectation of seeing his assailant.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Finally, the police could have avoided arranging a showup confrontation deep within the police building where the suspect would be surrounded only by law enforcement personnel.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Considered together as they occurred, these police practices heightened the suggestiveness of the confrontation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1182-13\">The record offers some indication, however, that the confrontation was <em>not unnecessarily </em>suggestive. Exigent circumstances may afford some justification for the use of suggestive procedures. <em>United States v. Abshire, </em>5 Cir., 1972, 471 F.2d 116, 120 (Judge Godbold specially concurring). <em>See also United States ex rel. Kirby v. Sturges, </em>7 Cir., 1975, 510 F.2d 397, 403-04. Although on appeal the State offered no justification for the procedure utilized, at trial the officer in charge of the investigation indicated that \u201cwe wanted to make sure we had the right men.\u201d It has been recognized that showups prompted by the need for immediate identification may \u201cpromote fairness by enhancing reliability of the identifications and permit expeditious release of innocent subjects.\u201d <em>United States v. Wilson, </em>1970, 140 U.S.App.D.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1113\">*1113</page-number>331, 332-33, 435 F.2d 403, 404-405.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Additionally, where the innocent have been mistakenly apprehended, prompt identification allows the police to realize their error and to continue their search while the criminal is still within easy reach.</p>\n<p id=\"b1183-4\">In the present case, the showup occurred within one and one-half hours after the crime. Consequently, some justification for the procedure utilized derives from the interests served by rapid crime solution. Although we fully commend prompt police action which leads to the quick and certain apprehension of the guilty,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> under the circumstances of this case due process considerations compel us to examine the reliability of the identification. Having concluded that the procedure used in this case was closer to the mark as unnecessarily suggestive, which we assume without deciding, we turn now to determine the reliability of the identification.</p>\n<p id=\"b1183-5\">\n<em>The Reliability Of The Identification</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1183-6\">In <em>Manson v. Brathwaite, </em>1977, 432 U.S. 98, 97 S.Ct. 2243, 53 L.Ed.2d 140, the Supreme Court emphasized that \u201creliability is the linchpin in determining the admissibility of identification testimony . . .\u201d 432 U.S. at 114, 97 S.Ct. at 2253. Unquestionably, Supreme Court jurisprudence attaches overriding importance to the reliability factor in appraising the totality of the circumstances.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> <em>Brathwaite </em>reaffirms that the reliability determination rests upon evaluation of the factors enumerated in <em>Neil v. Biggers, </em>1972, 409 U.S. 188, 93 S.Ct. 375, 34 L.Ed.2d 401. The factors considered include \u201cthe opportunity of the witness to view the criminal at the time of the crime, the witness\u2019 degree of attention, the accuracy of his prior description of the criminal, the level of certainty demonstrated at the confrontation, and the time between the crime and the confrontation.\u201d 409 U.S. at 199-200, 93 S.Ct. at 382. See also <em>Manson v. Brathwaite, </em>1977, 432 U.S. at 114, 97 S.Ct. at 2253.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Then \u201c[ajgainst these factors is to be weighed the corrupting effect of the suggestive identification itself\u201d in deciding whether due process has been observed. <em>Manson v. Brathwaite, </em>1977, 432 U.S. at 114, 97 S.Ct. at 2253.</p>\n<p id=\"b1183-13\">An examination of these factors in this case leads us to conclude that the District Court could properly hold that Burke\u2019s identification of Allen was sufficiently reliable so as to outweigh the corruptive effect of the asserted suggestive confrontation. Burke had an adequate opportunity to view <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1114\">*1114</page-number>Allen at close range under good lighting for several minutes before he was bound with tape. Burke was attentive to Allen because he recognized him as one who had rented a room on the previous night. Also, Burke\u2019s description of his assailants was given to police within minutes after the robbery, thereby enhancing its accuracy. In addition, Burke provided even more relevant information regarding the color and make of the car in which his assailants fled.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> At the pretrial suppression hearing Burke expressed a high level of certainty as to his identification of Allen, testifying that he \u201cwouldn\u2019t forget either [suspect] in a hundred years.\u201d Finally, the showup occurred within one and one-half hours after the crime. We do not have here the passage of a substantial amount of time which could affect the reliability of the identification. Consequently, although the showup confrontation was suggestive and should be viewed with doubts, these indicators of Burke\u2019s ability to make an accurate identification are not outweighed by the corrupting effect of the supposed unnecessarily suggestive showup.</p>\n<p id=\"b1184-4\">Prior to <em>Brathwaite, </em>several Circuits <footnotemark>15</footnotemark> had adopted a rule whereby testimony resulting from an unnecessarily suggestive pretrial identification would automatically be excluded from trial. Such a per se approach, however, did permit the admission of a subsequent in-court identification if that identification was determined to be reliable.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The Supreme Court in <em>Brathwaite </em>rejected the per se approach in favor of a totality of the circumstances approach. 432 U.S. at 112, 97 S.Ct. at 2252. Under the totality approach the admissibility of pretrial and in-court identification alike are governed by a single due process standard which accepts the reliability of the identification as the principal ingredient to be evaluated.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Therefore, under the totality approach a determination that the challenged identification is reliable means that testimony as to it and any identification in its wake is admissible.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1184-9\">In the present case only an in-court identification was introduced. While no error was committed by admitting such evidence due to its exceeding reliability, we cannot resist pointing out some questionable practices in the suppression hearing, such as viewing Allen at the counsel table, the prosecutor standing behind him, etc. Notwithstanding such actions the state trial judge made no objections to the prosecution\u2019s actions and ruled that an in-court identification would be admissible. The same conclusion was implicit in the federal District Judge\u2019s holding that the identification was reliable.</p>\n<p id=\"b1184-10\">\n<em>The Enhancement</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1184-11\">Allen also contends that he was denied due process and equal protection when a prior conviction was used to enhance his punishment under the Texas habitual of<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1115\">*1115</page-number>fenders statute. In <em>Nichols v. Estelle, </em>5 Cir., 1977, 556 F.2d 1330, Allen\u2019s co-defendant raised the identical argument and this Court found that such a contention failed to present a basis for habeas corpus relief. We find the reasoning and disposition of that case controlling. See also <em>Bradly v. Beto, </em>5 Cir., 1973, 473 F.2d 1039; <em>Willeford v. Estelle, </em>5 Cir., 1976, 538 F.2d 1194.</p>\n<p id=\"b1185-5\">In relation to his second contention, Allen\u2019s reply brief raised new allegations. Allen alleges that he was originally indicted for the offense of robbery by firearms but was offered 15 years in exchange for a plea of guilty. Accordingly to Allen, he was warned that if he did not plead guilty he would be reindicted and that an enhancement count would be included in the indictment. Allen claims he refused to enter a plea of guilty, was reindicted, and received a life sentence. On appeal to this Court Allen argues for the first time that his reindictment and life sentence resulted from vindictiveness on the part of the state because he exercised his right of trial by jury. This claim is not asserted directly or indirectly in the habeas petition no matter how liberally read. Because Allen has failed to exhaust available state court remedies with respect to this aspect of his second contention we express no opinion as to its merits. The decision of the District Court was correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b1185-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1179-26\">. Tex.Penal Code Ann. \u00a7 12.42 (1974).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1180-6\">. In <em>Simmons v. United States, </em>1968, 390 U.S. 377, 88 S.Ct. 967, 19 L.Ed.2d 1247, a pretrial photo identification procedure was challenged as violative of due process. Addressing the problems created in the trial courts by the wake of <em>Simmons, </em>this Court suggested adoption of the following practice which is equally applicable to all genre of identification techniques.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1180-7\">With the hope that it might prove of assistance to the District Judges of this Circuit in developing a uniform approach to the trial of cases in which a <em>Simmons </em>issue is present, we offer the following suggested procedure. Prior to offering the in-court identification before the jury, the trial judge should be accorded an opportunity out of the presence of the jury to determine if the picture spread in the particular case was impermissibly suggestive either in the photographs used or the manner or number of times they are displayed. If the judge makes such a determination, he then should determine if the impermissibly suggestive picture spread gives rise to a \u201clikelihood of irreparable misidentification.\u201d If both elements are found, <em>Simmons </em>prohibits the use of the in-court identification. However, if the judge does not find as a matter of law both that the picture spread was impermissibly suggestive <em>and </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1111\">*1111</page-number>that there is a substantial likelihood of irreparable misidentification, the in-court identification may be put before the jury. In such a case the defendant may use the facts of the picture spread for cross-examination purposes to attack the credibility of the identifying witness. The foregoing procedure will not only have the salutary effect of avoiding situations in which the District Judge must solemnly instruct the jury to disregard vital and unforgettable evidence, but will also save the defendant, the Hobson\u2019s choice of whether to attack the in-court identification by attacking a prior photographic identification that might wind up being upheld thereby reinforcing the identification of the defendant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1181-7\"><em>United States </em>v. <em>Sutherland, </em>5 Cir., 1970, 428 F.2d 1152, 1155 (footnote omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1181-8\">. Allen\u2019s codefendant, Rush O. Nichols, similarly pursued habeas relief. This Court earlier affirmed the denial of Nichols\u2019 writ in <em>Nichols v. Estelle, </em>5 Cir., 1977, 556 F.2d 1330.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1181-9\">. In <em>Simmons v. United States, </em>1968, 390 U.S. 377, 88 S.Ct. 967, 19 L.Ed.2d 1247, involving a pretrial photo identification, the Court phrased the test as whether the identification procedure \u201cwas so impermissibly suggestive as to give rise to a very substantial likelihood of irreparable misidentification.\u201d 390 U.S. at 384, 88 S.Ct. at 971. The <em>Stovall </em>phraseology was subsequently repeated in <em>Foster v. California, </em>1967, 394 U.S. 440, 442, 89 S.Ct. 1127, 22 L.Ed.2d 402. Both formulations are used in <em>Neil v. Biggers, </em>1972, 409 U.S. 188, 93 S.Ct. 375, 34 L.Ed.2d 401 and are referred to in <em>Manson v. Brathwaite, </em>432 U.S. 98, 97 S.Ct. 2243, 53 L.Ed.2d 140. Although this Circuit has utilized the <em>Simmons </em>formulation more often, the two phrasings represent different articulations of the same standard and we will use the original <em>Stovall </em>language. The <em>Stovall </em>formulation of <em>\u201cunnecessarily </em>suggestive\u201d seems to imply a duty on the part of the police to minimize suggestiveness. <em>United States v. Jones, </em>1975, 170 U.S.App.D.C. 362, 366, 517 F.2d 176, 180.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1181-15\">. Although this two-tier formulation has developed exclusively within the context of photographic identifications, it is equally applicable to situations, such as the present, where other types of confrontation procedures have been utilized since it is the procedure itself which is being evaluated. The Supreme Court has clearly developed a single due process standard for evaluating different types of procedures. See the cases cited in <em>Neil v. Biggers, </em>1972, 409 U.S. 188, 93 S.Ct. 375, 34 L.Ed.2d 401 and <em>Manson v. Brathwaite, </em>432 U.S. 98, 97 S.Ct. 2243, 53 L.Ed.2d 140.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1182-8\">. In the absence of suggestive procedure, the reliability of an identification may be challenged in the traditional manner before a jury in the courtroom by attacking the credibility of the witnesses. As we said recently, \u201c[o]nly when the eye witness identification is unreliable because of suggestive lineup procedures should a Court rule that the evidence is constitutionally inadmissible as a matter of law.\u201d Caver v. <em>Alabama, </em>5 Cir., 1976, 537 F.2d 1333, 1335.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1182-9\">. For example, the D.C. Circuit has recognized that \u201cconfrontations in which a single suspect is viewed in the custody of the police are highly suggestive,\u201d <em>United States v. Jones, </em>1975, 170 U.S.App.D.C. 362, 365, 517 F.2d 176, 179 <em>quoting Russell v. United States, </em>1969, 133 U.S.App. D.C. 77, 81, 408 F.2d 1280, 1284. The Seventh Circuit has accepted the proposition that \u201csignificant suggestion is inherent in the use of any showup . . . \u201d, <em>United States ex rel. Kirby v. Sturges, </em>7 Cir., 1975, 510 F.2d 397, 403. Similarly, the Eighth Circuit has warned that \u201cshowing only a single suspect to the witness is \u2018the most suggestive and, therefore, the most objectionable method of pretrial identification\u2019.\u201d <em>Sanchell v. Parratt, </em>8 Cir., 1976, 530 F.2d 286, 294 <em>quoting United States v. Dailey, </em>8 Cir., 1975, 524 F.2d 911, 914.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b1182-16\">. In another confrontation case this Court, in evaluating the suggestiveness of a police procedure, considered it relevant that the witness had not been told that the police had any suspects. <em>United States v. Henderson, </em>5 Cir., 1973, 489 F.2d 802, 804-05.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b1182-17\">. See <em>Stanley v.

United States, </em>1968, 132 U.S. App.D.C. 36, 405 F.2d 1104, then Judge Burger stated that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1183-10\">\u201c[t]here is no prohibition against a viewing of a suspect alone in what is called a \u2018one-man showup\u2019 when this occurs near the time of the alleged criminal act; such a course does not tend to bring about misidentification but rather tends under some circumstances to insure accuracy.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1183-11\"><em>Id. </em>132 U.S.App.D.C. at 38, 405 F.2d at 1106.

Other exigent circumstances which may afford some justification for the utilization of a showup include a <em>Stovall </em>type situation where the witness is unable to participate in a lineup, a situation as in <em>Simmons v. United States, supra, </em>where the suspect\u2019s unusual physical characteristics contributed to the impossibility of constructing a lineup with reasonably comparable subjects, and the case of the contumacious suspect whose rebellious action in a lineup would focus undue attention on him.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b1183-14\">. In a similar case where speed of police action was emphasized, <em>Marden v.

Smith, </em>5 Cir., 1977, 546 F.2d 1275, 1282; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Gidley, </em>5 Cir., 1976, 527 F.2d 1345, 1351.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b1184-5\">. This information, just as a description of a criminal\u2019s clothes or other distinguishing characteristics, is pertinent to the accuracy of the description. Burke apparently told police that his assailants \u201cwere driving a red Thunderbird, headed east, two white men, past middle age.\u201d Also, no claim has been made that Allen did not possess the physical characteristics described.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b1184-6\">. E. g., <em>United States v. Jones, </em>1975, 170 U.S. App.D.C. 362, 517 F.2d 178; <em>Brathwaite v. Manson, </em>2 Cir., 1975, 527 F.2d 363, <em>rev'd, </em>1977, 432 U.S. 98, 97 S.Ct. 2243, 53 L.Ed.2d 140.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b1184-7\">. Our cases appear to have implicitly followed the per se approach although this is unclear because only in-court identifications are questioned in those cases. Language from our opinions, however, strongly suggests that pretrial identifications would be excluded, e. g., <em>Bloodworth v. Hopper, </em>5 Cir., 1976, 539 F.2d 1382, 1383; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Sutherland, </em>5 Cir., 1970, 428 F.2d 1152, 1155, while in-court identifications could be admitted if found to be independent of the confrontation's s.uggestiveness. <em>United States v. Gidley, </em>5 Cir., 1976, 527 F.2d 1345, 1350; <em>Kelley v. Estelle, </em>5 Cir., 1975, 521 F.2d 238, 240. Our cases which discuss the admissibility of in-court identifications with independent sources of reliability clearly apply the <em>Biggers </em>criteria and, consequently, suggest that we had adopted the per se approach.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b1184-13\">. <em>Manson v.
