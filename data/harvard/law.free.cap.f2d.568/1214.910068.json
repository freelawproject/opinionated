Both appellants were sentenced to two years incarceration with the execution of their sentences suspended and were placed on probation for three years. In addition to the substantive counts, Littrell and Wasson were found guilty by the jury of conspiracy to possess the same Radio Shack calculators. 18 .U.S.C. \u00a7 371. After the verdict was returned, the trial court granted both appellant\u2019s motions for judgment of acquittal on the conspiracy count.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1285-16\">Appellants raise numerous issues on appeal. Of particular importance was whether the trial court should have granted severances from their co-defendants and each other due to misjoinder or, in the alternative, prejudicial joinder. For the following reasons, we reverse the judgments of conviction and remand for separate new trials.</p>\n<p id=\"b1285-17\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b1285-18\">On August 15, 1975, General Instruments of Canada shipped twenty-four cases of electronic calculators from Ontario, Canada, to Radio Shack in Fort Worth, Texas. Each case contained twenty-four calculators. This was the first shipment of this type of calculators to Radio Shack, and each calculator was marked with a particular serial number. Although the exact serial numbers could not be determined, based on production records, an approximate range for the serial numbers was C-100000 to C-101265. Several calculators obtained <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1216\">*1216</page-number>from Wasson, Littrell and other defendants were identified by a representative from General Instruments as being part of the August 15th shipment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1286-4\">Eastern Airlines\u2019 records from the Dallas-Fort Worth Regional Airport indicated that the 24 cases were received by Eastern in two separate shipments. Twenty-one cases were received by the airline on August 21, 1975, and were turned over to Regional Air Cargo that day at 2:00 P.M. Because this was not the complete shipment, Eastern prepared a \u201cdummy\u201d air bill to cover it. Eastern\u2019s records also reflect that they received the remaining three cases at the same airport and turned them over to Regional Air Cargo for delivery to Radio Shack at 6:30 A.M. the next morning. Signatures on both the \u201cdummy\u201d air bill and the original air bill indicated that all twenty-four cases were delivered to Regional Air Cargo by Eastern.</p>\n<p id=\"b1286-5\">The terminal manager for Regional testified that Regional normally kept their own records of shipments from the various airlines but that upon searching for them was unable to locate the records for August 21st or 22nd of 1975. He indicated it was easy for the records to be lost, and, therefore, placed no particular significance on their loss.</p>\n<p id=\"b1286-6\">The delivery of the calculators was made by Clarence Smith, an employee of Regional. He recalled that although both the \u201cdummy\u201d and the original air bill were signed by Radio Shack employees indicating receipt of all twenty-four cases, he did not remember making a delivery of the twenty-one cases to the Radio Shack warehouse but did remember delivering the three cases. Smith also indicated he knew one of the co-defendants, Joseph Weldon Kennedy, and had on occasion visited his place of business, Kennedy Sausage, in Weather-ford, Texas.</p>\n<p id=\"b1286-7\">The receiving clerk at the Radio Shack warehouse, Michael James, testified that his signature was on both air bills, again reflecting receipt of twenty-four cases of calculators on August 22, 1975. However, he also testified that he had no independent recollection of receiving them. On cross-examination by defense counsel, the witness admitted it would be possible for him to sign for portions of shipments not actually received. It was customary, however, when shipments were received at the Radio Shack warehouse that the employees, in addition to signing air bills indicating receipt, would also fill out a daily receiving summary and a daily receiving report both of which would indicate what was actually received through an actual count of the merchandise. This information was later transferred to another report called a \u201cKeyrec\u201d for the computer records. These records of the pertinent dates were introduced at trial, and they indicated Radio Shack received the three cases but not the twenty-one cases of calculators.</p>\n<p id=\"b1286-9\">David Johnson, office manager of the Radio Shack warehouse, testified that on September 5, 1975, he personally conducted a physical search in the warehouse for the twenty-one cases but was not able to find them. He also indicated that due to security precautions taken by Radio Shack it was extremely unlikely that twenty-one cases of calculators could be removed from inside the warehouse. The cost to Radio Shack of the calculators was established at $25.80 each with a retail price of $59.95 per calculator.</p>\n<p id=\"b1286-10\">The government\u2019s next witness, Gary Reader, testified that he saw Radio Shack calculators of the type introduced at trial at Kennedy Sausage Company in Weather-ford, Texas, in August or September, 1975. Reader also testified that he recognized the calculators as those from Radio Shack and subsequently telephoned Charles Tandy, President and Chairman of the Board of the Tandy Corporation which owns Radio Shack, to report what he saw. Tandy\u2019s testimony indicated he received a telephone call in September, 1975,&gt; which prompted him to contact his security chief with regards to the alleged missing calculators.</p>\n<p id=\"b1286-11\">Jay Miller, Special Agent with the Federal Bureau of Investigation, learned that appellant Wasson carried Radio Shack calculators at her place of business, the Coloni<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1217\">*1217</page-number>al Steak House, in Weatherford, Texas. Miller went to the Steak House in an undercover capacity on October 22, 1975. There, he observed Radio Shack calculators in a display case near the cash register priced at $19.95. Posing as a traveling salesman, Miller spoke with Wasson who told him the calculators were \u201ca very good deal\u201d because they normally sold for $59.95. Miller asked Wasson where she got the calculator to which she replied that one had to know the right people. She also stated that she had already sold many calculators and she could get more. At the time of this first meeting Wasson sold Miller the two Radio Shack calculators she had in stock and provided Miller with the requested sales receipt showing a price of $19.95 plus $1.00 state sales tax per calculator. Miller also asked if he could purchase thirty more calculators for his boss to distribute as Christmas gifts. Wasson gave Miller her name and telephone number and told him to contact her the next day.</p>\n<p id=\"b1287-5\">The next morning when Miller contacted Wasson, she told him she could probably have the calculators later that day. He called back later that day and Wasson informed him she only obtained four but could get twenty-six more within a few days. Miller went to the restaurant that day and purchased the four calculators for the same price and again obtained a sales receipt. Wasson also calculated for him the price of the additional twenty-six calculators and gave Miller her calculations. Miller asked if she would take a cheek but she indicated she would prefer cash.</p>\n<p id=\"b1287-6\">On October 27,1975, Miller called Wasson twice and both conversations were recorded and played for the jury at trial. The first, in pertinent part was as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1287-7\">WASSON: Colonial</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1287-8\">MILLER: Miss Wasson?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1287-9\">WASSON: Uh huh.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1287-10\">MILLER: This is Jay Miller. How you doing?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1287-11\">WASSON: Fine.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1287-12\">MILLER: Hey, I just came back in through Fort Worth here going over to Dallas.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1287-13\">WASSON: Oh, you . . . Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1287-14\">MILLER: How\u2019d you make out?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1287-15\">WASSON: I\u2019ve got 17.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1287-16\">MILLER: 17?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1287-17\">WASSON: Uh huh. And think I can have the rest of \u2019em for you by tomorrow but I\u2019m not sure about it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1287-18\">MILLER: Okay. Well, listen, will it be all right if I held off till, today being Monday, how about if I came by about Wednesday, would that be all right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1287-19\">WASSON: Yeah, be fine.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1287-20\">MILLER: Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1287-21\">MILLER: Okay. But you\u2019ve got 17 now and you think you can get what?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1287-22\">WASSON: I\u2019ll get, what is it, what, 9, 9 more?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1287-23\">MILLER: Well, he said get a total of 30 altogether, and we got four so, if you got 26 that would do it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1287-24\">WASSON: Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1287-25\">MILLER: Listen. Let me ask you this. You got \u2019em out there now?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1287-26\">WASSON: Yeah. I got \u2019em right now.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1287-27\">MILLER: Well . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1287-28\">WASSON: Be good if you could get \u2019em now so I could get a check covered.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1287-29\">MILLER: Well, I could, that\u2019s my problem. If you can take a check I can give you a check.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1287-30\">WASSON: What is it, a business check?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1287-31\">MILLER: Yeah. Well, listen, I\u2019ll tell you what. Let me, uh what time is it now?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1287-32\">WASSON: It\u2019s uh five after eleven.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1287-33\">MILLER: Could I call you back in a little bit and I may be able to just scratch out going to Dallas for a couple of hours and come on over. If not, I\u2019ll just wait until Wednesday and come on over and pick up the whole thing and I\u2019ll just make it later on in the day.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1287-34\">WASSON: Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1287-35\">MILLER: Is that all right with you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1287-36\">WASSON: Yes. Just fine.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1287-37\">MILLER: Let me call you back. I\u2019ll holler back within 15, 20, 30 minutes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1287-38\">WASSON: Okay, well, I\u2019ll be here.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1288-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1218\">*1218</page-number>MILLER: Okey dokey. Thank you.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1288-4\">(TR. 507-509).</p>\n<p id=\"b1288-5\">The second call, placed within an hour, proceeded, in pertinent part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1288-6\">WASSON: Colonial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1288-7\">MILLER: Garnette?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1288-8\">WASSON: Uh huh.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1288-9\">MILLER: Jay Miller.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1288-10\">WASSON: Uh huh.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1288-11\">MILLER: Hey, would it be okay with you if I came on by on Wednesday. I really, if I don\u2019t make, get down the road here a little bit I\u2019m going to have some problems.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1288-12\">WASSON: Yeah. That\u2019s be fine.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1288-13\"><em>% </em>* * <em>* </em>* <em>*</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1288-14\">MILLER: Yeah. Listen, you\u2019re going to have them all in the box again, right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1288-15\">WASSON: Yeah. Uh huh.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1288-16\">MILLER: Yeah, you know we want, he\u2019s going to give them as Christmas presents and he wants the calculators to be boxed so he can just wrap them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1288-17\">WASSON: Yeah.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1288-18\">MILLER: Is that the way they\u2019ll be?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1288-19\">WASSON: Yeah. Uh huh.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1288-20\">MILLER: Okay, well listen. Let me call you Wednesday morning or Wednesday after 1 o\u2019clock. If you don\u2019t hear from me right then, don\u2019t you go, don\u2019t go sellin\u2019 \u2019em on me now.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1288-21\">WASSON: Well, well I wouldn\u2019t. I\u2019m not buyin\u2019. I wouldn\u2019t buy that many unless I knew that I had a place to sell \u2019em.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1288-22\">MILLER: Yeah. Well listen, if he wants some more for Christmas presents how many more could you get him?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1288-23\">WASSON: I don\u2019t think too many.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1288-24\">MILLER: Not too many more?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1288-25\">WASSON: From all indications. If he does, you need to let me know in a hurry though so I can get whatever I can get.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1288-26\">MILLER: Well, damn, I should have asked him when I talked to him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1288-27\">WASSON: All. I know that\u2019s available now is just 12 more.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1288-28\">MILLER: Besides the 17?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1288-29\">WASSON: Beside, no there\u2019s another case available besides the 17.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1288-30\">MILLER: Oh, you got one more case available besides the 17.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1288-31\">WASSON: Urn hum.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1288-32\">MILLER: Hmm, damn. Could you pick \u2019em up for me and I\u2019m almost positive he\u2019ll take \u2019em, and I\u2019ll pay you cash for \u2019em then, that way instead.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1288-34\">WASSON: I\u2019d have to have cash.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1288-35\">MILLER: Yeah. But I\u2019d pay you cash for \u2019em. You can just pick. I just hate not to, you know, get in on \u2019em while we got \u2019em.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1288-36\">WASSON: Yeah. Well, it\u2019s a good deal.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1288-37\">MILLER: I know. I know. That\u2019s what I said, I was amazed \u2019cause you know</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1288-38\">WASSON: Have you compared \u2019em with other calculators yet?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1288-39\">MILLER: No, why?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1288-40\">WASSON: Well, I just wanted you to know that you did have a good deal.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1288-41\">MILLER: Well, I don\u2019t know how you can do it, but that\u2019s your business.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1288-42\">WASSON: Well, listen, do you want me to go ahead and get the case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1288-43\">MILLER: Get the case and he wanted 30, but then he said he\u2019ll send \u2019em out for Christmas presents on his own, too, and uh, you know he\u2019s going to give them to the guys at work, but then he\u2019ll just use them for his own too, so, well and he could rid of probably ten or twelve more. Well, I\u2019ve got 4 and that\u2019d make 44. Uh. Could you come up with, could you come up with like maybe 40 altogether.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1288-44\">WASSON: Uh, what\u2019s 24 and 17?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1288-45\">MILLER: 24 and 17.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1288-46\">WASSON: Yes, that\u2019s how many I can come up with.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1288-47\">MILLER: All right. Uh, that\u2019s 41. That\u2019s perfect. I\u2019ll take 41.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1288-49\">WASSON: Okay.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1288-50\">On October 30, 1975, Miller again met Wasson at the Colonial Steak House and purchased seventeen Radio Shack calculators from her. She again provided him with a receipt for the calculators. Miller <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1219\">*1219</page-number>identified at trial both the carton and the calculators he received on this occasion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1289-5\">On November 6, 1975, Miller called Was-son again and the following conversation took place:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1289-6\">WASSON: Hello.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1289-7\">MILLER: Garnett?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1289-8\">WASSON: Uh huh.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1289-9\">MILLER: Jay Miller. How ya doin?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1289-10\">WASSON: Doin fine.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1289-11\">MILLER: Get any more of those items.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1289-12\">WASSON: No, sure didn\u2019t. Hadn\u2019t seen anybody.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1289-13\">MILLER: Oh me. Okay. So I guess that\u2019s it then huh.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1289-14\">WASSON: As far as I know.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1289-15\">MILLER: Okay. Hey listen. I had a question on one of \u2019em. One of the darn things doesn\u2019t work. Can we just exchange that with you or how do we do it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1289-16\">WASSON: Well I, all I can do it just give you your money back on it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1289-17\">MILLER: Can I exchange it at Radio Shack do you think?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1289-18\">WASSON: I don\u2019t think so. I don\u2019t know.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1289-19\">MILLER: I mean, you know if I just took it down to the store and just told \u2019em it didn\u2019t work would they uh just swap one out?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1289-20\">WASSON: They could possibly.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1289-21\">MILLER: Okay, let me try to do that. All rightie. Uh well. I\u2019m probably going to be coming on through in a couple of days. Maybe I\u2019ll stop by and have lunch.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1289-22\">WASSON: All right, do it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1289-23\">MILLER: All rightie.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1289-24\">WASSON: Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1289-25\">MILLER: Good deal. Listen, sure appreciate everything you did on that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1289-26\">WASSON: All right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1289-27\">MILLER: Thank you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1289-28\">WASSON: Bye. Bye.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1289-29\">Perry Cole, Special Agent with the F.B.I., interviewed Wasson on November 11, 1975. After identifying himself as an agent and advising Wasson of her rights, Wasson told him she had been approached five or six weeks before by an individual she did not know who offered to sell her some Radio Shack calculators. She agreed to purchase twenty for $12.00 apiece. Thereafter she sold the calculators to her customers in the restaurant for $19.95 each plus tax. She also admitted knowing Joe Pina but stated he did not sell her the calculators. Wasson told Cole she purchased a total of forty-one calculators and admitted, upon learning later they were valued at $59.95, that she suspected the calculators were stolen.</p>\n<p id=\"b1289-31\">Agent Cole then requested permission to search Wasson\u2019s home and car which was granted by Wasson. Arrangements were made to conduct the search that afternoon.</p>\n<p id=\"b1289-32\">When Agent Cole and other agents returned to the restaurant, Wasson indicated she wished to change one part of her story. Everything she told them previously was true except it was Joe Pina who had sold her the calculators. Wasson also provided the agents with a cancelled check payable from the account of Colonial Steak House to Joe Pina in the amount of $120.00, dated September 1, 1975, and signed by Garnette Wasson as payment for the first group of calculators she purchased. The check was endorsed by Joe Pina and then Joseph Weldon Kennedy. The search turned up no other evidence. Wasson then signed a statement for the agents reiterating the above facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b1289-33\">Another Special Agent for the F.B.I., Fred Daulton, handled the interview with the other appellant, Littrell. This interview took place on the morning of November 11, 1975. Littrell first purchased one Radio Shack calculator <em>from Joe </em>Pina in September, 1975, for $25.00. Later that same month he purchased a total of thirty to fifty more at $12.50 per calculator. Pina, on one occasion, obtained a case of calculators from the trunk of his car to sell to Littrell. The trunk contained several other cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b1289-34\">For one of his purchases, Littrell paid Pina with a check which was returned by the bank for insufficient funds. Pina then came to see Littrell and collected the money in cash. Littrell tore up the check.</p>\n<p id=\"b1290-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1220\">*1220</page-number>Littrell also revealed to Daulton that Pina had said the calculators were from the factory. Littrell stated he knew that his then girlfriend, Garnette Wasson, had also bought some calculators from Pina during the same period of time.</p>\n<p id=\"b1290-4\">Several weeks prior to the F.B.I. interview and when Littrell still had five calculators in his possession, he found out the calculators retailed for approximately $65.00. His signed statement read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1290-5\">About two weeks ago I began to wonder about the calculators, after I saw an ad in the paper showing similar calculators for $65.00.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1290-6\">Littrell sold or gave away most of the calculators he had purchased from Pina. At the time of his interview, however, he returned five of the remaining calculators to the F.B.I. agents.</p>\n<p id=\"b1290-7\">Co-defendant, Joe Pina, testified for the government during the period he was awaiting sentencing. He testified he purchased the calculators from Kennedy for $10.00 each. Pina asked Kennedy twice if the calculators were stolen and was told they were not. However, Pina was suspicious and felt they might have been stolen. Pina sold an entire case and part of another to Wasson, and he sold part of a case to Littrell. Pina repeated Littrell\u2019s story of the bad check, revealed Kennedy had originally cashed it for him, and thereafter went to Littrell to get the money to repay Kennedy when the check was returned.</p>\n<p id=\"b1290-11\">Pina testified he saw one of the calculators displayed by the cash register in Was-son\u2019s restaurant and told her it should not be on display like that. At no time did either Littrell or Wasson question where Pina had obtained the calculators; however, Pina did advise them the calculators retailed for $59.95.</p>\n<p id=\"b1290-12\">Co-indictee, Ronald Williams, while awaiting sentencing, also testified for the government at the trial. His testimony was mainly concerned with his own purchase of calculators. Williams had never met Wasson until the arraignment in this case and had never discussed this case with Littrell.</p>\n<p id=\"b1290-13\">Written statements of Burkhart and Kennedy were also put in evidence. Burk-hart admitted purchasing a case of calculators from Kennedy but denied knowing they were stolen. Kennedy stated he purchased only twelve calculators for $16.00 each from a black man who came to his place of business. He denied ever reselling a single calculator although he admitted giving them to various employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b1290-14\">LITTRELL</p>\n<p id=\"b1290-15\">George Littrell raises three points of error for consideration by this court. He first contends the trial court should have granted his motion for severance on grounds of misjoinder under Fed.R.Crim.P. 8(b).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Littrell argues that Count I of the indictment<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1221\">*1221</page-number>does not allege one conspiracy but five distinct and unrelated conspiracies, and, therefore, he was improperly joined with the other defendants pursuant to this court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Levine, </em>546 F.2d 658 (5th Cir. 1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b1291-5\">The <em>Levine </em>Court provided that \u201c[i]n the absence of an argument of prosecutorial bad faith . . . allegations of an indictment will be accepted as true in deciding a Rule 8(b) motion.\u201d Id. at 663. No bad faith has been alleged in our case so we must decide as did the <em>Levine </em>Court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AQQN\">[Wjhether or not the conspiracy count as it stands was sufficient to satisfy rule 8(b)\u2019s requirement that the defendants \u2018have participated in the same act or transaction or in the same series of acts or transactions constituting an offense or offenses.\u2019 [Citations omitted]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1291-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 664.</p>\n<p id=\"b1291-8\">We find that it was sufficient. In <em>Levine, </em>the court found the face of the conspiracy count clearly pointed to the existence of two separate conspiracies with a common defendant. The government\u2019s support for charging only one conspiracy was \u201cthe false legal premise that proof of proximate or simultaneous conspiracies with one common conspirator was sufficient to establish the existence of a single conspiracy.\u201d Id. at 665. There is no such reliance by the government here. The government believed it could prove the existence of a single conspiracy wherein the six defendants charged conspired to acquire and possess stolen calculators with the intention to resell for profit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1291-18\">Littrell argued to the court on his motion for severance that the evidence was not sufficient to connect the \u201cspokes\u201d of this alleged \u201cwheel\u201d conspiracy. His argument was only factual in nature. A claim of misjoinder under Rule 8 is reviewable on appeal as a question of law. <em>United States v. Levine, </em>546 F.2d 658, 661 (5th Cir. 1977); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Park, </em>531 F.2d 754, 760 (5th Cir. 1976); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Marion</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1222\">*1222</page-number><em>neaux, </em>514 F.2d 1244, 1248 (5th Cir. 1975); <em>Tillman </em>v. <em>United States, </em>406 F.2d 930, 933 n. 5 (5th Cir. 1969), <em>vacated on other grounds, </em>395 U.S. 830, 89 S.Ct. 2143, 23 L.Ed.2d 742. Although the trial court\u2019s subsequent granting of the motion for judgment of acquittal on the conspiracy count indicates that on the facts Littrell was correct, it does not support the issue of an improper legal interpretation of conspiracy law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1292-4\">Since we find that joinder was authorized under Rule 8(b), we now must consider Littrell\u2019s assignment of error to the trial court\u2019s denial of his motion for severance which raised the existence of prejudice during trial under Fed.R.Crim.P. 14.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1292-5\">The Supreme Court in <em>Schaffer v. United States, </em>362 U.S. 511, 80 S.Ct. 945, 4 L.Ed.2d 921 (1960), stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1292-6\">We do emphasize, however, that . the trial judge has a continuing duty at all stages of the trial to grant a severance if prejudice does appear. And where, as here, the charge which originally justified joinder turns out to lack the support of sufficient evidence, a trial judge should be particularly sensitive to the possibility of such prejudice.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1292-7\">Id. at 516, 80 S.Ct. at 948. <em>See also United States v. Clark, </em>480 F.2d 1249, 1252 (5th Cir. 1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b1292-8\">The weighing of the prejudice shown against the interests of judicial economy is committed to the sound discretion of the trial judge and an appellate court will not substitute its own judgment for that of the trial judge without an affirmative showing that the trial court abused its discretion. <em>United States </em>v. <em>McLaurin, </em>557 F.2d 1064, 1074-1075 (5th Cir. 1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b1292-9\">The existence of prejudice turns upon the facts of each case and the test this court uses states:*</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1292-11\">[Wjhether under all the circumstances of the particular case, as a practical matter, it is within the capacity of the jurors to follow the court\u2019s admonitory instructions and accordingly to collate and appraise the independent evidence against each defendant solely upon that defendant\u2019s own acts, statements and conduct. In sum, can the jury keep separate the evidence that is relevant to each defendant and render a fair and impartial verdict as to him? If so, though the task be difficult, severance should not be granted.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ao2S\"><em>Tillman v. United States, </em>406 F.2d 930, 935 (5th Cir. 1969), <em>vacated in part </em>395 U.S. 830, 89 S.Ct. 2143, 23 L.Ed.2d 742 (1969). In <em>Tillman </em>this court also stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1292-12\">In determining on appeal whether the jury was in fact confused, the court will look to the verdict. Convictions will invariably be sustained if it may be inferred from the verdict that the jury \u2018meticulously sifted the evidence\u2019, as where it acquits on certain counts.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1292-13\">406 F.2d at 936, <em>citing </em>8 Moore, Federal Practice \u00b6 14.04[1], p. 19 (2d ed. 1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b1292-14\">Here, the government stated in its closing argument:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1292-15\">As regard the conspiracy, ladies and gentlemen, I submit to you that the facts and evidence show that the conspiracy existed between Joe Pina and Weldon Kennedy and that the conspiracy did <em>not </em>exist between Littrell and Wasson. [Emphasis added]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1292-16\">(TR. 865). The jury thereafter found Kennedy, Wasson and Littrell guilty of conspiracy.</p>\n<p id=\"b1292-17\">The government\u2019s statements alone indicate that they did not prove Littrell was part of the conspiracy. The jury\u2019s action in convicting Littrell makes it apparent that the jury was confused, and that this confusion was prejudicial to Littrell\u2019s case. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1223\">*1223</page-number>However, the trial court then granted Littrell\u2019s motion for judgment of acquittal as to the conspiracy count. This action by the trial court remedied the prejudice which was caused by trial with defendants whose guilt was supported by substantial evidence, but we must now decide whether that prejudice spilled over into the jury\u2019s consideration of the substantive count charged against Littrell. In this case, we are not prepared to say that Littrell was not prejudiced. Although the evidence was sufficient to support the verdict on the substantive count, it was not so overwhelming that the obvious guilt of Kennedy did not tip the scales against Littrell. Therefore, we find the trial court abused its discretion in failing to grant a severance, and we remand this case to the trial court for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1293-5\">Littrell\u2019s last point on appeal was based on an alleged comment by the government in closing argument on Kennedy\u2019s failure to testify which in turn was prejudicial to him. Although we doubt this comment had such an effect, because we are remanding for a new trial where it is unlikely to recur, we find it unnecessary to discuss this point.</p>\n<p id=\"b1293-6\">WASSON</p>\n<p id=\"b1293-7\">Wasson raises on appeal, as did Littrell, the failure of the trial court to grant a severance pursuant to Rules 8(b) or 14 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. Wasson claims that although she did not file her own motion prior to or during the trial, she was joined by the court in Littrell\u2019s motion for severance. As an alternative, she suggests that even if the court finds she did not join in Littrell\u2019s motion, there was sufficient cause to find relief from waiver under Fed.R.Crim.P. 12(f).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1293-8\">Upon reviewing the record where Wasson claims the trial judge joined her in the motion of Littrell, we conclude the judge was clearly referring to the motions for judgment of acquittal filed at the close of the government\u2019s case in chief, not Littrell\u2019s pretrial motion for severance. Wasson, therefore, was not joined in the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1293-13\">Next, we consider defendant Was-son\u2019s alternative argument. For the reasons discussed above with respect to Littrell, we found prejudice existed arising from the trial court\u2019s failure to sever his case from that of the other defendants. That same prejudice existed for Wasson. This Circuit has held where a defendant does \u201cnot either before or during trial move for a severance, to prevail on this issue now, [he] must demonstrate actual prejudice resulting from the failure to sever his trial from that of his co-defendant[s].\u201d <em>United States v. Washington, </em>550 F.2d 320, 328 (5th Cir. 1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b1293-14\">Under the circumstances of this case, co-defendant Littrell brought to the trial court\u2019s attention the possibility of prejudice by his motion for severance and the trial court denied that motion as it would have Wasson\u2019s. Because the trial court has a continuing duty to be on the lookout for possible prejudice, and the jury\u2019s verdict in this case made the existence of actual prejudice apparent, we find that in the interests of justice, Wasson\u2019s judgment of conviction should be reversed and her case remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1293-15\">Again, because we are returning her case to the district court for a new trial, we find it unnecessary to consider Wasson\u2019s fourth argument that she was prejudiced by certain actions of the government\u2019s attorney. It is extremely unlikely this alleged error will recur during a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1293-16\">Finally, Wasson suggests there was insufficient evidence to sustain her conviction. In evaluating the evidence, we have viewed it in the light most favorable to the government, <em>Glasser v. United States, </em>315 U.S. 60, 80, 62 S.Ct. 457, 469, 86 L.Ed. 680 (1942), and find that there was sufficient <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1224\">*1224</page-number>evidence to support a conviction.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> However, in reversing her conviction for prejudicial joinder (as well as Littrell\u2019s) we do not foreclose the possibility that a non-prejudiced jury may take a different view of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1294-4\">For the foregoing reasons, we reverse the judgments of conviction and remand them for separate new trials.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1285-12\">. Other defendants on trial with Garnette Was-son and George Littrell were Joseph Kennedy and Steve Burkhart. Co-indictees included Ronald Williams and Joseph Alfred Pina who both plead guilty, after plea bargaining, to one substantive count of possession of goods stolen while being transported interstate. Williams and Pina testified at trial against the other four. Kennedy was convicted on both conspiracy and one substantive count. Burkhart, charged only under the conspiracy count, was granted a judgment of acquittal at the close of the government\u2019s case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1290-8\">.
