The accident occurred at Brady-Hamilton\u2019s facility at the Port of Longview, Washington. Herron filed a claim under the Longshoremen\u2019s and Harbor Workers\u2019 Compensation Act (Act), 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 901 <em>et seq. </em>(1970 &amp; Supp. V 1975). Brady-Hamilton contested the claim, alleging that Herron\u2019s injury was not covered by the Act. The administrative law judge held that the Act did cover Herron\u2019s injury and awarded compensation. The Benefits Review Board (Board) affirmed the award, and Brady-Hamilton filed for review of the Board\u2019s order in this court pursuant to 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 921(c) (Supp. V 1975).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-10\">Brady-Hamilton is a contract stevedore which loads and unloads vessels using its own equipment. The equipment is stored and repaired in a building owned by Brady-Hamilton and known as a gear locker. The gear locker is located approximately 2,600 feet north of the edge of the Columbia River and 2,050 feet outside of the entrance gate of the Port of Longview. Two other stevedore companies maintain gear lockers adjacent to Brady-Hamilton\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-11\">Nine days before his injury, Herron had been hired by Brady-Hamilton from the longshoremen\u2019s union hiring hall. He worked on a daily basis as a gear locker-man, responsible for repairing, maintaining, refueling, and inspecting the equipment. housed in the gear locker, and for transporting it between the locker and the pier. These tasks required Herron to be aboard ships from time to time. When injured he was unloading steel plates from a pickup truck parked at the gear locker. The administrative law judge found that these plates were to be installed on a vessel in such a way that logs loaded on the vessel could be securely fastened to the plates.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-12\">The portions of the Act which determine the outcome of this case were significantly amended in 1972. Longshoremen\u2019s and Harbor Workers\u2019 Compensation Act Amendments of 1972, Pub.L.No.92-576, \u00a7 2, 86 Stat. 1251 (1972). The Act now provides coverage to \u201cemployees\u201d injured \u201cupon the navigable waters of the United States,\u201d as those terms and phrases are specially defined. The relevant portions of the Act provide:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-15\">The term \u201cemployee\u201d means any person engaged in maritime employment, including any longshoreman or other person engaged in longshoring operations, and any harborworker including a ship repairman, shipbuilder, and shipbreaker, but such term does not include a master or member of a crew of any vessel, or any person engaged by the master to load or unload or repair any small vessel under eighteen tons net.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b209-16\">33 U.S.C. \u00a7 902(3) (Supp. V 1975).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-17\">Compensation shall be payable under this chapter in respect of disability or death of an employee, but only if the disability or death results from an injury occurring upon the navigable waters of the United States (including any adjoining pier, wharf, dry dock, terminal, building way, marine railway, or other adjoining area customarily used by an employer in loading, unloading, repairing, or building a vessel). .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b209-18\"><em>Id. </em>\u00a7 903(a). The requirements for coverage set forth in the two paragraphs quoted are commonly called the status and situs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>requirements, respectively. Brady-Hamilton argues that neither requirement was satisfied in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-4\">\n<em>Status</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">Brady-Hamilton claims that Herron was not engaged in maritime employment when he was injured and that therefore he has not met the status requirement. The Company attacks the findings of the administrative law judge as to the intended use of the steel plates which Herron was unloading, urging that the plates did not relate to maritime employment. - Conflicting testimony as to the intended use of the steel plates was presented at trial and we would be reluctant to overturn the findings of the administrative law judge.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We need not decide the question, however, since the argument made by Brady-Hamilton rests upon a misperception of the meaning of the status requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-6\">In <em>Northeast Marine Terminal Co. v. Caputo, </em>432 U.S. 249, 97 S.Ct. 2348, 53 L.Ed.2d 320 (1977), the Supreme Court held that one \u201cwhose employment is such that [he] spendfs] at least some of [his] time in indisputably longshoring operations\u201d is a statutory employee. <em>Id. </em>at 273, 97 S.Ct. at 2362. The Court held that the text and the history of the 1972 amendments \u201cdemonstrate a desire to provide continuous coverage throughout their employment to these amphibious workers [longshoremen] who, without the amendments, would be covered only for part of their activity.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b210-7\">Brady-Hamilton apparently concedes that Herron was engaged in longshoring activity during at least a portion of his working day. Moreover, the Board\u2019s conclusion that a gear lockerman\u2019s function is an \u201cintegral and essential part of the overall longshoring operations\u201d (Record, vol. I, at 128) is supported by evidence in the record that Herron was required at times to work aboard ship and even in the hold at tasks directly related to loading and unloading cargo. To exclude Herron from coverage in the instant case would be to reinstate the same degree of \u201cshifting and fortuitous coverage that Congress intended to eliminate.\u201d 432 U.S. at 274, 97 S.Ct. at 2363. We are directed by <em>Northeast Marine Terminal </em>to give effect to the remedial purpose of the Act by adopting a broad construction of the status requirement. Satisfaction of the status requirement does not depend upon the task which the employee was performing at the moment of injury. For these reasons we conclude that Herron meets the status test for coverage under the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-11\">\n<em>Situs</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b210-12\">Situs and status must coincide before coverage will attach. Each test acts as a control upon the other so as to diminish the potential for undue expansion of coverage. Admittedly, neither test is precise, and cases will often arise which present questions of coverage that are difficult to resolve. But by operating coordinately, the status and situs tests fix coverage within somewhat more certain bounds than would be the case under either test alone. With these observations, we turn to the situs test as it applies to Herron\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-13\">In order to satisfy the situs test, Herron\u2019s injury must have occurred upon the navigable waters of the United States, which are defined in the Act to include any \u201cadjoining area customarily used by an employer in loading, unloading, repairing, or building a vessel.\u201d 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 903(a) (Supp. V 1975). Brady-Hamilton argues that the situs of Herron\u2019s injury did not adjoin navigable waters since its gear locker was not contiguous with the Columbia River.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-14\">While <em>Northeast Marine Terminal </em>is not dispositive of the situs question, the approach of the Court in interpreting the Act is instructive. The Court found that the 1972 amendments were motivated by two congressional purposes: (1) to recog<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>nize that modern cargo handling techniques have moved much of a longshoreman\u2019s work onto land, and (2) to provide continuous coverage to workers who would otherwise be covered for only part of their activities. 432 U.S. at 249, 97 S.Ct. 2348. We do not think that by adverting to specific changes in the nature of cargo-handling operations Congress intended to refuse coverage to those maritime workers who for reasons other than changes in cargo-handling techniques work farther away from the water\u2019s edge than they formerly did. In order to further Congress\u2019 goal of uniform coverage, the phrase \u201cadjoining area\u201d should be read to describe a functional relationship that does not in all cases depend upon physical contiguity. Consideration should be given to the following factors, among others, in determining whether or not a site, is an \"adjoining area\u201d under section 903(a): the particular suitability of the site for the maritime uses referred to in the statute; whether adjoining properties are devoted primarily to uses in maritime commerce; the proximity of the site to the waterway; and whether the site is as close to the waterway as is feasible given all of the circumstances in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">All of the machinery and equipment in the Brady-Hamilton gear locker was used exclusively for loading and unloading vessels at the Port of Longview. Adjacent buildings were used as gear lockers by other companies. The administrative law judge found that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b211-6\">Expediency requires that a stevedore company\u2019s gear locker be located as close as possible to the dock area where the loading and unloading activities occur . . The land area abutting the water's edge can only accommodate a limited number of warehouses and other docking facilities that must of necessity be located as close as possible to the ships being loaded and unloaded. Bearing this in mind, I find that Brady-Hamilton\u2019s gear locker was located in as close proximity to the dock loading area as was feasible and as circumstances permitted.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b211-7\">(Record, vol. I, at 33). The facility here was used as an integral part of longshoring operations. Based on all of the foregoing, we hold that the injury occurred at a place within the situs requirements of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-8\">The Fifth Circuit reached a like conclusion in a similar case. <em>Texports Stevedore Co. </em>v. <em>Winchester, </em>554 F.2d 245 (5th Cir. 1977) (per curiam). There a gear locker-man was injured in a gear locker located five blocks from the water\u2019s edge. The court held that the claimant met both the status and the situs requirements of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-9\">Brady-Hamilton finally urges that coverage of Herron under the Act would exceed the power of Congress under the Constitution. Such contention is without merit. Congress has \u201cparamount power to determine the maritime law which shall prevail throughout the country,\u201d <em>Detroit Trust Co. </em>v. <em>The Thomas Barlum, </em>293 U.S. 21, 43, 55 S.Ct. 31, 38, 79 L.Ed. 176 (1934), including authority over maritime contracts. <em>Id. </em>at 48. The Supreme Court has suggested that Congress, if it so desired, could extend the Act\u2019s coverage to all longshoremen by exercising its power over maritime contracts. <em>Nacirema Operating Co. v. Johnson, </em>396 U.S. 212, 215, 90 S.Ct. 347, 24 L.Ed.2d 371 (1969). <em>See Victory Carriers, Inc. v. Law, </em>404 U.S. 202, 216, 92 S.Ct. 418, 30 L.Ed.2d 383 (1971). The facts of this case, however, do not require us to examine the outermost limits of Congress\u2019 legislative authority under its admiralty and maritime jurisdiction. We hold that coverage of Herron under the Act is within that jurisdiction by reason of the longshoring character of the work performed and the extent to which choice of the site was governed by considerations of the maritime economy.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-10\">The petition is denied; the order below is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"Az5\">.
