We find no basis to question that decision. Appeals from rulings by three-judge courts are .governed by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1253 which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-27\">Except as otherwise provided by law, any party may appeal to the Supreme Court from an order granting or denying, after notice and hearing, an interlocutory or permanent injunction in any civil action, suit or proceeding required by any Act of Congress to be heard and determined by a district court of three judges.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b526-28\">Therefore, because it is not provided otherwise, we find this court to be wrong forum for appeal and dismiss this appeal for lack of jurisdiction.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>See Carter </em>v. <em>Stanton, </em>405 U.S. 669, 92 S.Ct. 1232, 31 L.Ed.2d 569 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>(1972); <em>Oldroyd v.

Thompson, </em>415 U.S. 452, 94 S.Ct. 1209, 39 L.Ed.2d 505 (1974) to support his position that this court has jurisdiction. The appellant in <em>Steffel </em>did not appeal the denial of injunctive relief by the single judge therefore the Circuit Court of Appeals had jurisdiction. However, in n. 7 in <em>Steffel </em>the Supreme Court states the original suit for injunctive relief should have been before a three-judge panel and concludes the Court of Appeals would not have had jurisdiction.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
