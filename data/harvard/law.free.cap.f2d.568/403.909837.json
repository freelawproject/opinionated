On appeal, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission argues that this litigation was not \u201cfrivolous or vexatiously brought,\u201d and the award of attorney\u2019s fees should be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-13\">Subsequent to the district court\u2019s decision, the standard for awarding fees to a prevailing defendant has undergone much judicial scrutiny. In <em>Bolton v. Murray Envelope Corp., </em>553 F.2d 881, 884 n.2 (5th Cir. 1977), this Court seemed to indicate in a footnote that a defendant could recover only when the suit was \u201cvexatious or frivolous.\u201d While we were holding this case for Supreme Court resolution of the issue on the grant of certiorari from <em>EEOC v. Christiansburg Garment Co., </em>550 F.2d 949 (4th Cir. 1977), <em>cert. granted, </em>432 U.S. 905, 97 S.Ct. 2948, 53 L.Ed.2d 1077 (1977), another panel determined, without reference to <em>Bolton </em>or <em>Christiansburg, </em>that defendants could recover attorney\u2019s fees under the same standard which applies to plaintiffs. <em>United States v. Allegheny-Ludlum Industries, Inc., </em>558 F.2d 742, 744 (5th Cir. 1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b474-15\">The Supreme Court has now unanimously determined that a prevailing defendant can recover attorney\u2019s fees from a plaintiff only if the claim was \u201cfrivolous, unreasonable, or groundless, or . the plaintiff continued to litigate after it clearly became so.\u201d <em>Christiansburg Garment Co. v. EEOC, </em>- U.S. -, -, 98 S.Ct. 694, 701, 54 L.Ed.2d 648 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b474-19\">We remand this case for reconsideration in light of <em>Christiansburg </em>for two reasons. First, the district court did not indicate the legal test it applied in awarding attorney\u2019s fees to Eastex and is entitled to review the application for attorney\u2019s fees anew under the <em>Christiansburg </em>standard. Second, the district court\u2019s order does not contain sufficient facts to resolve the legal contention of either party on this appeal. It is presumed the district court will make findings of fact to support any decision that it makes under the <em>Christiansburg </em>standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-20\">We note that there were no findings of fact to support the amount of attorney\u2019s fees awarded. This Court has repeatedly stressed the need for factual findings to support an award of attorney\u2019s fees. <em>See Cook v. Oschsner Foundation Hospital, </em>559 F.2d 270, 273 (5th Cir. 1977); <em>Wolf v. Frank, </em>555 F.2d 1213, 1218-1219 (5th Cir. 1977) (collecting cases); <em>Johnson v. Georgia Highway Express Co., </em>488 F.2d 714 (5th Cir. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>1974). In the event of an award on remand, a new order can remedy this defect. We, of course, do not indicate in any way the outcome that should ensue under <em>Christiansburg.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b475-4\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
