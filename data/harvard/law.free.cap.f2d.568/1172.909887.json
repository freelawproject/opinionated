The appellant suffered a considerable degree of hearing loss in both ears, thereby rendering her unable to continue her work as a registered nurse. She filed an application for disability insurance benefits, claiming that her deafness constituted a disability as defined in the Social Security Act.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Secretary of Health, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1173\">*1173</page-number>Education and Welfare denied the appellant disability benefits on the ground that she was not disabled within the meaning of the Social Security Act. The district court upheld the Secretary\u2019s decision, finding that the decision was supported by substantial evidence on the record as a whole. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1243-4\">The appellant was examined by several experts in the field of hearing and hearing disability. Dr. Joel P. Smith, an otorhinolaryngologist, examined the appellant on two occasions. He testified that the appellant could function moderately well in most average situations when the proper environment was maintained. He further testified that the appellant should be able to perform quite well in occupations for which \u201csocial hearing\u201d is not as necessary as for a registered nurse. Dr. Stewart, a vocational expert, testified that the appellant is capable of performing industrial and non-industrial jobs, and he described many such jobs.</p>\n<p id=\"b1243-5\">The appellant contends, however, that she is unable to engage in any \u201csubstantial gainful work\u201d pursuant to \u00a7 423(d)(2)(A). The appellant alleges that she must work in a \u201ccontrolled environment\u201d and that the evidence shows that the types of jobs she can perform are not available in a \u201ccontrolled environment.\u201d As Dr. Smith testified, the \u201ccontrolled environment\u201d necessary for productive work by the appellant is an environment in which \u201csocial hearing is not so necessary.\u201d There is substantial evidence in the record to support the Secretary\u2019s finding that the working environment of several jobs, such as file clerk, desk clerk, marker, industrial inspector, tester, and quality control checker, constitute the \u201ccontrolled environment\u201d referred to by the Administrative Law Judge and the witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b1243-6\">In reviewing the Secretary\u2019s findings, this court performs a strictly limited function. The court may only determine whether there is substantial evidence in the record to support the Secretary\u2019s decision. <em>Williams v. Finch, </em>440 F.2d 613, 615 (5th Cir. 1971); <em>Staples v. Gardner, </em>357 F.2d 922, 923 (5th Cir. 1966). In the case on appeal, the appellant did not carry her burden of proving that she was disabled within the meaning of the Social Security Act. The decision of the Secretary and the judgment of the district court were amply supported by competent evidence in the record. The judgment from which this appeal is taken is AFFIEMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1242-15\">. The Social Security Act defines \u201cdisability\u201d as an \u201cinability to engage in any substantial gainful activity by reason of any medically determinable physical or mental impairment which can be expected to result in death or which has lasted or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than 12 months.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 423(d)(1)(A). Section 423(d)(2)(A) of the Act further provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1242-27\">[A]n individual . . . shall be determined to be under a disability only if his physical or mental impairment or impairments are of such severity that he is not only unable to do his previous work but cannot, considering his age, education, and work experience, engage in any other kind of substantial gainful work which exists in the national economy, regardless of whether such work exists in the immediate area in which he lives, or whether a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1173\">*1173</page-number>specific job vacancy exists for him, or whether he would be hired if he applied for work. For purposes of the preceding sentence.(with respect to an individual), \u201cwork which exists in the national economy\u201d means work which exists in significant numbers either in the region where such individual lives or in several regions of the country.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
