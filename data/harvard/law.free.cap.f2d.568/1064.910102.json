The principal question for review is whether there was presented at trial sufficient evidence to sustain these convictions. We affirm the convictions of George and Honeycutt but reverse the conviction of Barr.</p>\n<p id=\"b1136-19\">The government\u2019s primary evidence at trial consisted of tapes of the court authorized wire interceptions of conversations conducted between December 19, 1975 and January 5, 1976 on three telephones located in the residence of Fred Orr Snider, a bookmaker in Gastonia, North Carolina. Agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation identified the voices that had been recorded.</p>\n<p id=\"b1136-20\">Gambling records and paraphernalia seized at George\u2019s residence in Rock Hill, South Carolina, and a tape of 14 telephone conversations between George and Snider were introduced into evidence against George, who for purposes of this appeal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1067\">*1067</page-number>admits to being a bookmaker. Although no bets were made or discussed during these conversations, all of which were initiated by George over a period of 18 days, Snider provided \u201cline information\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> to George upon request. In the course of two such conversations, the following exchanges took place:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1137-5\">George: \u201cNumber 7?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1137-6\">Snider: I got Miami 4V2. Better make Miami of Ohio 4V2.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1137-7\">George: They played South Carolina (unintelligible).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1137-8\">Snider: 4 then. Yeah.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1137-9\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1137-10\">George: \u201cHow about that LA? Any changes?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1137-11\">Snider: \u201cNo. It\u2019s 6. Are they playing on St. Louis?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1137-12\">George: \u201cPlaying on St. Louis. A fellow here has got it 5, and another fellow has got it scratched.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1137-13\">Snider: \u201cHe has? Make it 5V2 then.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1137-14\">George: \u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019ll do (unintelligible).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1137-15\">On numerous occasions in September and October of 1975, government agents undertook surveillance of Louyn Summerford, an associate of Snider\u2019s. During this period Summerford established a pattern of making telephone calls at public stations in different locations in Charlotte, North Carolina. The telephone toll records introduced at trial showed that Summerford regularly made calls to Lowell Miller, a bookmaker and linesetter in Cullman, Alabama, followed by calls to Snider in Gastonia and to George in Rock Hill. On December 6 and 8, 1975, Snider was under surveillance in Gastonia. On each of these dates he was observed making a telephone call from a public telephone near his home, and both of these calls were billed to a number listed to Patricia Ridenhour in Charlotte. Toll records introduced at trial indicated that, during November and December, 1975, constant, almost daily calls were made from public telephones in Gastonia to Miller in Alabama and billed to the Riddenhour number.</p>\n<p id=\"b1137-25\">With regard to appellant Honeycutt, the evidence introduced at trial showed that, during the period of the wire intercept, he made 13 telephone calls to Snider from his residence in Albemarle, North Carolina. In the course of these conversations, Snider <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1068\">*1068</page-number>provided line information to Honeycutt, and on two occasions Honeycutt placed bets with Snider. No search was made of Honeycutt\u2019s residence and the government was therefore unable to produce any documentary evidence that might show Honeycutt to be a bookmaker. However, the government argues that the identity of Honeycutt as a bookmaker and \u201clay-off\u201d bettor<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> rather than as a mere bettor was established by terminology in two intercepted telephone conversations as explained by the government expert witness on gambling. Following is an excerpt of one conversation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1138-4\">Snider: \u201cYeah. I pick up 6, and I got some action on the other side, and I bet on it myself. I give 3V2 4, trying to steal something myself.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1138-5\">Honeycutt: \u201cHell, I wouldn\u2019t take a chance getting hit in the crack, by God. I got 6 and held it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1138-6\">In interpreting Honeycutt\u2019s statement about not wanting to \u201ctake a chance getting hit in the crack,\u201d the government witness testified that this refers to \u201csome problem a bookmaker has in varying his line and taking bets that he doesn\u2019t get into a situation referred to as middling, where he gets bets at too widely varied lines and he can end up losing both bets.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1138-7\">A second conversation contained the following exchange:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1138-8\">Snider: \u201cMiami 131/2. Scratch Pittsburgh. Miami 4.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1138-10\">Honeycutt: \u201cOK. Goddamn I\u2019m going to get killed. .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1138-11\">Snider: \u201cWhy?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1138-12\">Honeycutt: \u201cI\u2019m loaded like a bear.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1138-13\">Snider: \u201cOn what?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1138-14\">Honeycutt: \u201cOn Pittsburgh.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1138-15\">Snider: \u201cWhy? Don\u2019t make no difference.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1138-16\">Honeycutt: \u201cI might win anyway, mightn\u2019t I?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1138-18\">Snider: \u201cYeah. They\u2019ll probably put it back up on anyway. I\u2019ll probably have it up after awhile anyway.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1138-19\">Honeycutt: \u201cLet me give you a number. If you put it on, call me and I\u2019ll give you some action.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1138-20\">Snider: \u201cAll right:\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1138-21\">In analyzing the above exchange, the Government expert witness testified as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1138-22\">\u201cAs I recall the game, there were several calls talking about this one particular game, Pittsburgh against Los Angeles, and Los Angeles, I think supposedly had three of their running backs * * * injured. And for that reason, when there is a rather outstanding injury like that in a game, it\u2019s impossible to handicap that type of thing once the betting has taken place, so therefore they scratch the game or take it off the board; that is, the (sic) just allow no more betting. All the betting that has taken place at that time stays in effect, but the (sic) just don\u2019t dare let the betting continue because obviously most of the bettors would bet on the team that doesn\u2019t have the injuries, in this case, Pittsburgh. So the only thing they can do is scratch the game or take it off the board. What this individual is indicating is that he is .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1138-23\">* * * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1138-24\">\u201cHe is saying he\u2019s loaded like a bear, I think the expression was, meaning he has a lot of bets on the game. Theoretically they would be bets, well, they could be bets on either side, but .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1138-25\">* <em>* </em># * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1138-26\">\u201cMost likely there would be a predominance of bets on Los Angeles, but at any rate, once the thing is off the board, that means if he doesn\u2019t take any more bets on it, he can\u2019t tend to even back up or get some kind of balance he wants to be in, and then they conclude, well, maybe they\u2019ll put the game back on the board and start taking bets on it and then maybe you can even it up, or maybe Los Angeles will win it anyway.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1138-27\">The evidence against appellant Barr, a resident of Kannapolis, North Carolina, consisted of gambling records and parapherna<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1069\">*1069</page-number>lia and of tapes of seven telephone calls from Barr to Snider wherein Snider provided Barr with \u201cline information\u201d at the latter\u2019s request. No bets were made or discussed during these calls. For purposes of this appeal, Barr admits to being a bookmaker.</p>\n<p id=\"b1139-5\">Each of the appellants contends that the evidence introduced at trial was insufficient to sustain a jury finding that he was conducting an illegal gambling business within the meaning of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1955.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence upon an appeal from a jury verdict of guilty, we of course examine the evidence in the light most favorable to the government. <em>Glasser v. United States </em>(1942) 315 U.S. 60, 62 S.Ct. 457, 86 L.Ed. 680; <em>United States v. Sherman </em>(4th Cir. 1970) 421 F.2d 198, 199, <em>cert. denied </em>398 U.S. 914, 90 S.Ct. 1717, 26 L.Ed.2d 78. It is also settled, in this Circuit, that circumstantial evidence may support a verdict of guilty, even though it does not exclude every reasonable hypothesis consistent with innocence. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Bobo </em>(4th Cir. 1973) 477 F.2d 974, 989, <em>cert. denied </em>421 U.S. 909, 95 S.Ct. 1557, 43 L.Ed.2d 774; <em>United States v. Chappell </em>(4th Cir. 1965) 353 F.2d 83, 84.</p>\n<p id=\"b1139-8\">Appellant George placed no bets with Snider during the period of the wire intercept. He was, however, constantly acquiring \u201cline information\u201d from Snider; during the eighteen days of electronic surveillance, George called Snider fourteen times about the \u201cline\u201d. The transcripts of two of these conversations (the relevant portions of which are set forth above) readily support the inference that George was routinely following Snider\u2019s instructions in setting his own \u201cline\u201d. In each instance a discussion of the \u201cline\u201d regarding a certain football contest was followed by an instruction from Snider to George with respect to how George should set his \u201cline\u201d. The second conversation, in particular, illustrates the extent to which George followed the \u201cline\u201d given to him by Snider; there, in response to Snider\u2019s instruction to \u201c[m]ake it [the line] 5V2 then,\u201d George replied, \u201c[tjhat\u2019s what I\u2019ll do.\u201d On the basis of such language the jury could reasonably infer that George regularly followed the \u201cline\u201d given to him by Snider.</p>\n<p id=\"b1139-9\">By complying with the Snider \u201cline\u201d, George helped to enhance the Snider risk-minimizing function; where the \u201clines\u201d set by two bookmakers are identical, or nearly so, the bettors are unable to play off one \u201cline\u201d against the other to the disadvantage of the bookmakers involved.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Thus, evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1070\">*1070</page-number>dence that George regularly acceded to the \u201cline\u201d which was constantly transmitted to him by Snider formed a sufficient basis upon which the jury could properly conclude that George was helping Snider to conduct an illegal gambling business within the meaning of \u00a7 1955<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1140-4\">It should be noted, however, that the government also presented other evidence tending to implicate George in the conduct of Snider\u2019s gambling operation. A combination of physical surveillance evidence and toll records during September and October of 1975 showed that Summerford, one of Snider\u2019s gambling associates, established a pattern of calling Miller, a linesetter in Alabama, followed immediately by calls to Snider and George. This pattern of calls supports the inference that George had a priority greater than that of other bookmakers involved with the Snider operation in that he alone was privileged with an immediate notification by Summerford of the current status of the \u201cline\u201d. The inference that these calls to Miller were in fact for the purpose of obtaining \u201cline information\u201d is strengthened by the fact that when Summerford discontinued his calls to Miller (allegedly because he became surveillance-conscious), Snider began making the calls.</p>\n<p id=\"b1140-5\">Thus, there was sufficient evidence to support a jury finding that George would regularly accede to the \u201cline\u201d set by the Snider operation, one of whose principal operatives regarded George\u2019s position in the organization as sufficiently important to warrant the immediate transmittal to him of \u201cline information\u201d gained from a linesetter in Alabama. Surely, then, the jury was justified in finding that George was one of those conducting an illegal gambling operation within the meaning of \u00a7 1955.</p>\n<p id=\"b1140-8\">The evidence presented at trial against Honeycutt also was clearly sufficient to support a guilty verdict under \u00a7 1955. The tapes of certain telephone conversations between Honeycutt and Snider, together with the expert testimony analyzing those conversations, provided a sound evidentiary basis upon which the jury could properly conclude that Honeycutt was a bookmaker who placed \u201clay-off\u201d bets with the Snider operation. First, there was Honeycutt\u2019s statement to Snider that \u201cI wouldn\u2019t take a chance getting hit in the crack * * *. I got 6 and held it.\u201d This statement, coming in response to Snider\u2019s remark in reference to his own point spread on a particular football contest, was sufficient to support the inference that Honeycutt was a bookmaker referring to the point spread at which he accepted bets on a particular game. The expert testimony analyzing this conversation as one dealing with a problem peculiar to bookmaking only confirmed what was already obvious; Honeycutt was a bookmaker.</p>\n<p id=\"b1140-9\">The second conversation tended to show not only that Honeycutt was a bookmaker, but also that he was in the practice of \u201claying off\u201d bets with the Snider operation in an effort to balance his books.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In analyzing this conversation, the government\u2019s expert witness testified that the \u201cscratching\u201d of a game by a bookmaker (i. a, his refusal to take any more bets on that game) leaves a bookmaker who has taken most of his bets on one team in a position where he cannot lay off these bets to the \u201cscratching\u201d bookmaker so as to even up his bets and minimize his risk on the outcome of the game; that in the instant case, Honeycutt\u2019s statement that \u201cI\u2019m going to get killed\u201d because \u201cI\u2019m loaded like a bear . on Pittsburgh,\u201d indicated that, \u201cmost likely,\u201d he had made \u201ca predominance of bets <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1071\">*1071</page-number>on Los Angeles\u201d (the team whose numerous injuries had led to the scratching of the game). The words of this telephone conversation, in conjunction with the expert testimony, support, if they do not command, the inference that Honeycutt was a bookmaker with a heavier than desired emphasis of bets on one side of a particular athletic contest and that he was attempting to lay off these bets with the Snider operation. Honeycutt actually made two bets with the Snider operation during the following ten days. Although the terse language surrounding these transactions provides no indication whether they were \u201clay-off bets,\u201d the fact that Honeycutt had earlier attempted to lay off a bet with Snider may be sufficient to support the inference that these bets were \u201clay-off\u201d bets. Even without the presence of these two bets, however, the \u201cloaded bear\u201d conversation provided a sufficient basis for concluding that Honeycutt was in the practice of laying off bets with Snider.</p>\n<p id=\"b1141-4\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1955 applies to \u201c[w]hoever conducts, ... all or part of an illegal gambling business\u201d which \u201cinvolves five or more persons.\u201d The section \u201cdoes not include the player in an illegal game of chance, nor the person who participates in an illegal gambling activity by placing a bet.\u201d 1970 U.S.Code Cong. and Admin.News, p. 4029. In <em>United States v. McHale </em>(7th Cir. 1974) 495 F.2d 15, the Court was presented with a situation similar to the one presently before this Court. There, the defendant contended that, although he was a \u201clay-off\u201d bettor and although bets of this kind are made between bookmakers, he was not \u201cconducting\u201d a gambling operation nor was he part of a five-person business. The Court disagreed, stating at p. 18:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1141-5\">\u201cThe only exclusions intended by Congress were the individual player or bettor and not the professional bookmaker who also in the course of his business bets.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1141-8\">\u201c \u2018Thus Congress\u2019 intent was to include all those who participate in the operation of a gambling business, regardless [of] how minor their roles and whether or not they [are] labelled agents, runners, independent contractors or the like, and to exclude only customers of the business.\u2019 <em>United States v. Becker, </em>461 F.2d 230, 232 (2d Cir. 1972). \u2018As the House Committee Report stated, the term \u201cconducts\u201d is broad enough to include both \u201chigh level bosses and street level employees.\u201d \u2019 <em>United States v. Hunter, </em>478 F.2d 1019, 1022 (7th Cir. 1973) (includes runners, telephone clerks, salesmen and a watchman as \u2018conducting\u2019 a gambling operation).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1141-9\">\u201cCertainly the lay off-bettor is a more obvious target of \u00a7 1955 than runners, salesmen, clerks, or watchmen.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1141-10\">Although this Court does not suggest that any bet between bookmakers is sufficient to bring them within \u00a7 1955, or that the laying-off of bets between a bookmaker and a non-bookmaker necessarily brings the latter within this section,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> we are of the opinion that when a bookmaker lays off his own bets with another bookmaker, he comes within the scope of \u00a7 1955.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Accordingly, we hold that there was sufficient evidence to support Honeycutt\u2019s \u00a7 1955 conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1141-11\">The evidence presented at trial against Barr tended to show that Barr was a bookmaker, which he admits for purposes of this appeal. However, with respect to Barr, unlike George, there is no inference to be drawn from the tapes of his telephone conversation with Snider that he was regularly, or even occasionally, acquiescing in the line set by Snider; the tapes show only that, on seven occasions, Snider provided Barr with \u201cline information\u201d upon request. Nor does the evidence suggest that Barr laid off bets with the Snider operation; indeed, no bets of any kind were made or discussed. The case against Barr, there<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1072\">*1072</page-number>fore, consists basically of evidence showing that Barr was a bookmaker who sometimes received \u201cline information\u201d from Snider. The government argues, in effect, that the mere fact that the opportunity for \u201clay-off\u201d betting is present may be used as a basis for a \u00a7 1955 conviction of someone in Barr\u2019s position. We disagree. Were the government\u2019s position adopted, a bookmaker might be found to be conducting an illegal gambling operation under \u00a7 1955 in combination with any and all bookmakers with whom he communicated,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> for the opportunity for \u201clay-off\u201d betting presumably exists as between any two bookmakers. We have found no case where the occasional acquisition of \u201cline information\u201d by one bookmaker from another has been held sufficient to bring the former within the scope of \u00a7 1955, and we decline to so hold now. Accordingly, Barr\u2019s \u00a7 1955 conviction is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1142-4\">The appellants also argue that the evidence presented at trial was insufficient to support their convictions for conspiracy to conduct an illegal gambling business in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371. With respect to George and Honeycutt, the same evidence presented by the government in support of the substantive counts of the indictment was also sufficient to meet the conspiracy standard as set forth in the unchallenged instructions of the trial judge: \u201c[I]n order to establish proof that a conspiracy existed [the government must show] that the members in some way or manner * * *, positively or tacitly came to a mutual understanding to try to accomplish a common and unlawful agreement\u201d (/. e., to operate an illegal gambling business). George\u2019s cooperation with Snider in setting the line and Honeycutt\u2019s \u201clay-off\u201d bets bring these appellants within the scope of the conspiracy statute as it applies to \u00a7 1955.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1142-6\">Barr\u2019s conspiracy conviction, on the other hand, must be reversed. The government showed no intent on the part of Barr to accomplish anything other than what he did. As the thing actually done (occasionally requesting and receiving \u201cline information\u201d), standing alone, does not constitute a \u00a7 1955 violation, the agreement to do that thing cannot be said to be an illegal conspiracy in contravention of \u00a7 371.</p>\n<p id=\"b1142-10\">Appellant Honeycutt argues that he should have been granted a new trial,, or at least an evidentiary hearing with respect thereto, pursuant to Rule 33, Fed.R.Crim.P. He argues that an expert witness in the area of gambling had agreed to testify for him to the effect that the comments made by Honeycutt to Snider in the two intercepted conversations as to which the government expert witness testified were fairly susceptible of various other interpretations consistent with innocence. There was no such expert testimony on Honeycutt\u2019s behalf at trial, he claims, because he was surprised by the content of the government expert witness\u2019 testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b1142-11\">Whether to grant a motion for a new trial is within the discretion of the trial judge, and there is not even a hint of an abuse of that discretion in the present case. Honeycutt had an opportunity at trial to bring in his own expert witness to provide alternative interpretations of the intercepted conversations and to refute the interpretation offered by the government, but he failed to do so. And the fact that the government witness had been called to testify in similar trials on similar matters of interpretation should have put Honeycutt on notice as to what might develop at trial. Finally, although he now claims surprise, Honeycutt made no motion for a continuance at the time of the government expert witness\u2019 -testimony or thereafter, and there is nothing in the record which indicates any effort by Honeycutt to secure attendance of an expert witness at trial who might have rebutted the government witness\u2019 interpretation of the evidence in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b1143-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1073\">*1073</page-number>We find without merit Barr\u2019s contention that a reversal of his conviction in the present case calls for a reversal of the Trial Court\u2019s revocation of his probation and activation of a suspended sentence under a prior conviction in 1974.</p>\n<p id=\"b1143-5\">Finally, the issue of requisite plurality need not be addressed, as this Court\u2019s affirmation of the convictions of two of the three appellants increases the total number of participants in the illegal gambling operation, by the appellants\u2019 own count, to the five person minimum.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1143-6\">The convictions of the appellants George and Honeycutt are affirmed; the conviction of the appellant Barr is reversed but the revocation of his probation and activation of a suspended sentence under a prior conviction is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1136-13\">.

Ideally, a bookmaker has an equal amount wagered on both sides of each event with the result that he has a ten percent profit, less expenses, and, ideally, loses nothing. In truth, betting is rarely equal on both sides and bookmakers <em>may </em>lose money, even to the point of their businesses being destroyed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1137-23\">\u201cTo protect against losses, a bookmaker normally engages in \u2018lay off betting whereby he passes on to another bookmaker the amount of bets by which his own \u2018book\u2019 is unbalanced; thus to the extent he loses to his own customers, he wins back from the other bookmaker, or vice versa. The \u2018lay off bet is therefore, in effect, bookmaker\u2019s insurance or reinsurance. Bookmakers, however, can place personal wagers with one another which are not \u2018lay off\u2019 bets.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AC8\">\u201cThe \u2018line\u2019 constitutes the \u2018odds\u2019 or \u2018handicaps\u2019 or \u2018point spreads\u2019 on the wagered contests. This is a list of the teams and events with a certain number of points attributed to the nonfavored team. To win a bet on the favored team, therefore, that team must win by a score exceeding the point spread given to the nonfavored team. The \u2018line\u2019 is subject to change as a given event approaches and a bookmaker may alter the \u2018line\u2019 on a particular event in order to try and even out the money wagered on each side.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AtJP\">\u201cBookmakers may cooperate with one another by keeping their \u2018lines\u2019 consistent in order to avoid \u2018middling,\u2019 whereby a bettor, because there are two different point spreads on a single event, may bet and win on both competing teams * * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ARZC\">For an excellent discussion of the various aspects of a bookmaking operation, <em>see United States </em>v. <em>Box </em>(5th Cir. 1976) 530 F.2d 1258, 1260-62 and cases cited therein.

Although the term \u201cconduct\u201d is not defined by the statute, the authors of simultaneously-enacted 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1511, which was to parallel \u00a7 1955, intended \u201cconduct\u201d to mean any participation in the operation of a gambling business. H.R.Rep. No. 91-1549, 91st Cong. 2d Sess. (1970), 1970 U.S.Code, Cong. &amp; Admin.News, pp. 4029-30. <em>See United States v. Ceraso </em>(3d Cir. 1972) 467 F.2d 653, 656; <em>United States v.

To illustrate: A bookmaker who set his \u201cline\u201d on a professional football game as favoring the Dallas Cowboys by 6'A points over the Washington Redskins would desire that other bookmakers in the same general betting area set their \u201clines\u201d similarly. If, instead, another bookmaker set his \u201cline\u201d at Dallas by 9'A points over Washington, a bettor could take advantage of the variation by betting on Dallas with the first bookmaker (giving away 6\u2018A points to Washington) and on Washington with the second bookmaker (taking 9\u2018A points from Dallas). The bettor would then be in a no-loss situation (assuming, of course, that the two bets were of equal amounts). If Dallas wins by seven to nine points, the bettor wins both bets, while if Dallas wins by more than nine points or if Dallas fails to win by more than six points, the bettor splits the bets and breaks even.</p>\n<p id=\"ARN9\">This calculation, obviously, does not take into account the 10% of the amount of the bet which the bettor must surrender to a bookmaker in the event of a losing bet. Nevertheless, the playing off of varying \u201clines\u201d against one another presents bookmakers with the dual dilemma of a bettor possibly winning two bets without the chance of losing both, and of heavy betting on one\u2019s own \u201cline\u201d which cannot then safely be laid off on the other \u201cline\u201d to even the bets (as the bookmaker laying off bets is then in the position of losing both bets if the result of the contest falls in the middle of the two spreads \u2014 in the above case, if Dallas wins by seven to nine points).</p>\n<p id=\"AGV\">For other discussions of the varied line situation and the importance to bookmakers of not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1070\">*1070</page-number>allowing any larger variations than necessary, <em>see United States </em>v. <em>Bobo, </em>supra, 477 F.2d at 977, 990; <em>United States v.

McCoy, supra, </em>where the Court reversed a \u00a7 1955 conviction, stating that the defendant \u201cwas not shown to have regularly accepted and used McCoy\u2019s [the head of the gambling operation] line information, nor is there any evidence suggesting that [the defendant] would regularly accede to McCoy\u2019s line when given that information.\u201d 539 F.2d at 1062.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b1140-11\">.

Sacco </em>(9th Cir. 1974) 491 F.2d 995, the Court reached a similar conclusion, holding that the placement by the uefendant bookmaker of $6,570 in \u201clay-off\u201d bets with an illegal gambling operation constituted sufficient evidence to sustain his \u00a7 1955 conviction as a conductor of that operation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b1142-7\">.

Indeed, George concedes on appeal that \u201c[i]f those calls for line information were proof that George conducted part of Snider\u2019s operation, it would follow that those calls were also acts in furtherance of a conspiracy to conduct such business and George\u2019s convictions of both the substantive offenses and the conspiracy should be affirmed.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b1143-18\">. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1955(b)(1)(a). All three appellants conceded in their briefs that there were three participants in the illegal gambling operation. On oral argument, George admitted that there were four such participants, so that the affirmation of convictions in the present case brings his count of participants to six.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
