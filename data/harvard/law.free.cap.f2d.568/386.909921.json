Anderson and his wife<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> from the United States Tax Court\u2019s decision presents the issue of when a cash basis taxpayer may deduct prepaid interest. After moving to California in June 1968, Anderson, a successful real estate builder and investor, was approached by Lytton Savings and Loan Association of Northern California (Lytton) about the possibility of purchasing Adobe Wells Motor Home Park. Several months of negotiations followed. On August 2, 1968, the parties signed a Letter of Intent for the purchase. According to that document, Lytton intended to sell the property for $2,700,000 financed by a twenty-year loan which required prepayment of approximately $500,000, representing interest for approximately thirty months. A more formal agreement was to be executed within twenty-five days during which time the property would not be sold to anyone else. Nonetheless, a contract for Anderson\u2019s purchase of the property was not completed until December 27,1968. During this interim, a second potential buyer made a higher offer for the property and the cost of completing the trailer park also increased. As a result, the price finally agreed upon with Anderson increased from $2,700,000 to $2,995,000. The closing of the transaction and prepayment of interest finally occurred on December 30, 1968.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-6\">In 1968 Anderson had income of $652,-894.36. Anderson, a cash basis taxpayer, deducted the entire amount of prepaid interest in the Adobe Wells deal, the sum of $500,000, in that year. Along with other deductions, this resulted in his having a $28,491 net loss for tax purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-12\">An IRS audit of Anderson\u2019s return resulted in a disallowance of taxpayer\u2019s deduction of the entire $500,000 of prepaid interest in 1968 and required Anderson to allocate the prepayment over the taxable years involved in the loan. The result was a tax deficiency for 1968. The IRS determination was in accordance with its Revenue Ruling 68-643, 1968-2 C.B. 76, issued on November 26, 1968. Taxpayer\u2019s petition to the Tax Court resulted in an adverse decision and Anderson appealed to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-13\">Anderson is, of course, entitled to a deduction for the $500,000 interest paid on money borrowed to purchase the trailer park since \u201c[t]here shall be allowed as a deduction all interest paid on accrued within the taxable year on indebtedness.\u201d I.R.C. \u00a7 163(a). However, the dispute here involves the year or years in which the deduction may be taken. The solution depends on the accounting method used. A cash basis taxpayer would normally be able to deduct interest only in the year paid while an accrual basis taxpayer would be able to deduct interest only when he received the benefits of the prepayment. <em>See </em>I.R.C. \u00a7 461(a).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Usually a taxpayer may apply his regular accounting method for computing his taxable income and his allowable deductions. <em>See </em>I.R.C. \u00a7\u00a7 446(a), 461(a). However, a different method may be compelled if his accounting method does not \u201cclearly reflect income.\u201d <em>See </em>I.R.C. \u00a7 446(b).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b458-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>The Internal Revenue Service initially resisted efforts by cash basis taxpayers to deduct the entire prepayment of interest in the year of payment. However, after the decisions in <em>Fackler v. Commissioner, </em>39 B.T.C. 395 (1939), <em>a cq. </em>1939-1 C.B. 11, <em>acq. withdrawn </em>1968-3 C.B. 3, and <em>Court Holding Company v. Commissioner, </em>2 T.C. 531 (1943), <em>a cq. </em>1943 C.B. 5, <em>acq. withdrawn </em>1968-2 C.B. 3, the Commissioner accepted the position that for interest paid for less than five years in advance, a cash basis taxpayer would have an allowable deduction for the year in which the amount was paid. In 1968, however, the Commissioner changed his policy in this regard and issued a Revenue Ruling which required a cash basis taxpayer to deduct the interest over the period for which it was paid. By its terms the ruling was made effective for prepaid interest payments for a period not in excess of five years made on or after November 26, 1968.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b458-11\">We find the Commissioner\u2019s position in Revenue Ruling 68-643 valid as applied to this transaction. This change can be justified on several grounds. Requiring the taxpayer to accrue the prepayment to interest is consistent with the treatment of other prepayments such as prepaid insurance or rent. <em>See </em>Asimow, Principle and Prepaid Interest, 16 U.C.L.A.L.Rev. 36, 74-84 (1968). In addition, prepaid interest, particularly in real estate transactions, was becoming a major form of tax avoidance. <em>See id. </em>at 37-38. Finally, while the earlier cases had been concerned about the fairness of requiring a taxpayer to change his accounting method with respect to a single item, <em>see, e. g., Fackler v. Commissioner, supra, </em>later versions of the Internal Revenue Code explicitly authorized hybrid methods of accounting. <em>See </em>I.R.C. \u00a7 446(c)(4). Other circuits which have considered the Commissioner\u2019s current stance on the deductibility of prepaid interest by a cash basis taxpayer have approved singling out prepaid interest <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>for separate accounting treatment. <em>See Resnik v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, </em>7 Cir., 1977, 555 F.2d 634; <em>Sandor v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, </em>9 Cir., 1976, 536 F.2d 874; <em>Burck v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 2 </em>Cir., 1976, 533 F.2d 768.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-5\">Further, we find that the validity of Revenue Ruling 68-643 is unimpaired by recent legislation requiring a cash basis taxpayer to treat any prepayment of interest as paid in the period to which the interest is allocable. <em>See </em>I.R.C. \u00a7 461(g).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> While conflicting legislative history can be cited, most of the statements in the committee reports accompanying the legislation indicate that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Anp\">no inference should be drawn concerning the deductibility of prepaid interest paid before the effective dates of the new rule. It is expected that deductions for such prepayments will be determined according to the criteria of present law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A1\">S.Rep.No.94-938, 94th Cong., 2d Sess. 105 (1976), U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News 1976, p. 3541. Moreover, the taxpayer is incorrect in his contention that the amendment would be unnecessary if Revenue Ruling 68-643 properly interpreted the then existing law. While this legislation controls transactions within the scope of that Ruling, the amended legislation also requires accrual of the interest deductions in situations not covered by Revenue Ruling 68-643. That Revenue Ruling treated prepayments for less than twelve months in advance on a case by case basis. In addition, cases under that Revenue Ruling required a showing that the prepayment of interest materially distorted the taxpayer\u2019s income. <em>See Burck </em>v. <em>Commissioner, supra, </em>at 773-74. The amended section 461 now automatically disallows a deduction for any prepayment of interest, even those for less than twelve months, which is properly allocable to another taxable year and without any necessity of showing that income was distorted. Since this new subsection 461(g) extends to transactions beyond the reach of Revenue Ruling 68-643, the validity of that Ruling would not reduce the need for this legislation.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-12\">The Tax Court correctly applied Revenue Ruling 68-643 to the facts presented here. Only two days of the approximately thirty months for which the interest was paid occurred in the 1968 taxable year. The amount of the prepayment was substantial, $500,000. In fact, if deductible, this prepayment, along with other deductions, would enable the taxpayer to claim a net loss in a year in which he received more than $650,000 of income. \u201cThe Commissioner has broad powers in determining whether accounting methods used by a taxpayer clearly reflect income . .\u201d <em>Commissioner v. Hansen, </em>360 U.S. 446, 467, 79 S.Ct. 1270, 1282, 3 L.Ed.2d 1360 (1952). Under this standard, the Tax Court\u2019s determination that taking the entire deduction in 1968 under these circumstances had the effect of materially distorting income was correct and should not be upset.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-14\">The only remaining point is Anderson\u2019s allegation that the agreement to purchase the property and to prepay the interest was a binding contract prior to Novem<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>ber 27, 1968 and thus was not covered by Revenue Ruling 68-643. While the parties engaged in negotiations before November 27, the record does not support a finding that a contract was reached prior to December 27, 1968. The only basis for such a finding would be the Letter of Intent dated August 2, 1968.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> But under California law this document is insufficient for a contract.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ACs\">There is no meeting of the minds of the' parties while they are merely negotiating as to the terms of the agreement to be entered into. To be final the agreement must extend to all the terms which the parties intend to introduce, and material terms cannot be left for future settlement .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b460-4\"><em>Dillingham v. Dahlgren, </em>52 Cal.App. 322, 329, 198 P. 832, 835 (1921). In particular, a binding contract for the sale of property must specify \u201cthe seller, the buyer, the price to be paid, the time and means of payment, and the property to be transferred . . . <em>King v. Stanley, </em>1948, 32 Cal.2d 584, 197 P.2d 321 <em>(en banc).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b460-6\">The Letter of Intent fails to comply with these standards. The purchase price, a critical item in a contract, was increased by almost $300,000 between the signing of the Letter and the signing of a final contract. While Anderson contends that the parties agreed that the final price would depend on the costs of completing the project, the Letter of Intent provided no method for determining the price and instead left the matter to future negotiations. The Letter also failed to state any time for the transaction to occur. From the record it does not appear that Lytton could compel Anderson to pay interest for any time prior to the signing of the promissory note in December. Finally, the Letter clearly contemplated the possibility that the transaction would not be consummated since it stated that the Letter was null and void if a later written agreement was not reached and only prohibited the sale of the property to third parties for a period of twenty-five days. The record does not include sufficient evidence of any prior oral contract to support a conclusion that the Tax Court erred in its decision that no contract existed prior to November 27, 1968. Hence, taxation of this transaction is governed by Revenue Ruling 68-643 and the deficiency was properly assessed.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b457-7\">.

In relevant part Revenue Ruling 68-643 reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-10\">In view of certain abuses which have arisen with respect to prepayment of interest by taxpayers using the cash receipts and disbursements method of accounting, the Service has reexamined its position in I.T. 3740. The Service now concludes that the deduction of prepaid interest in the year of payment by a taxpayer employing the cash receipts and disbursements method of accounting may not result in a clear reflection of income for the taxable year of payment. A deduction for interest paid in advance on each indebtedness for a period not in excess of 12 months of the taxable year immediately following the taxable year in which the prepayment is made will be considered on a case by case basis to determine whether a material distortion of income has resulted. Some of the factors to be considered in determining whether the deduction of prepaid interest gives rise to a material distortion of income include but are not limited to the amount of income in the taxable year of payment, the income of previous taxable years, the amount of prepaid interest, the time of payment, the reason for prepayment, and the existence of a varying rate of interest over the term of the loan. If interest is prepaid for a period extending more than 12 months beyond the end of the current taxable year, the deduction of such prepaid interest in the taxable year of payment will be considered as materially distorting income. Where a material distortion of income has been found to result from the deduction of prepaid interest, the Service will require the taxpayer to change his method of accounting with respect to such prepaid interest in order to allocate it over the taxable years involved.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-13\">In view of the foregoing, I.T. 3740 is revoked. However, pursuant to the authority contained in section 7805(b) of the Code, this Revenue Ruling will be applied without retroactive effect to interest prepayments for periods not in excess of five years made prior to November 26, 1968 by taxpayers employing the cash receipts and disbursements method of accounting. This Revenue Ruling also will be applied without retroactive effect to an interest prepayment for a period not in excess of five years made on or after November 26, 1968, by a taxpayer employing the cash receipts and disbursements method of accounting, pursuant to a legal obligation incurred prior to such date to make such prepayment.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b459-6\">.
