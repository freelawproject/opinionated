Act No. 189, September 15, 1961, Sp.Sess., particularly \u00a7 3(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b492-4\">A petty jury, September 21, 1965, found him guilty and imposed a $100 fine, to which the trial judge added six months in the county jail.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">September 15, 1964, two detectives <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> arrested Early, presumably an Alabama resident, ostensibly for driving a motor car with a Mississippi tag. Code 1940, T. 51, \u00a7 693, as amended. Coy Rathel, riding on the front seat, right hand side, of the car, pushed a paper bag under the front seat.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-6\">One officer questioned Early, the other Rathel.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-7\">After he had analyzed them, Nelson Grubbs, State Toxicologist, stationed at Mobile, identified the contents of the paper bag as being tablets of amphetamine salt, There were some 4,000 tablets of which the witness ground up ten for testing. He considered them representative of the bulk, although he took his ten tablets from <em>only </em>one of three bottles which the detectives had sequestered.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-9\">The only link in the evidence to connect Early with the amphetamine tablets came from a confession made at the Mobile Police Station.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-10\">We quote in part from the testimony of Mr. J. M. Romagnano:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-11\">\u201cHow long did you keep the defendant John Early in the room interrogating him?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-12\">\u201cA. Oh, we didn\u2019t keep him long, 8 or 10 minutes, something like that, 5 or 10 minutes, \u2014 it wasn\u2019t long.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-13\">\u201cQ. Before you started asking him questions he had been placed under arrest, had he not?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-14\">\u201cA. Yes sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-15\">\u201cQ. All right sir, at that time when you started asking him questions, did you advise him that any statements that he might make could be used against him ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-16\">\u201cA. No sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-17\">\u201cQ. Did you advise him that he had a right to an attorney before he made any statements ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-18\">\u201cA. No, \u2014 to be honest with you, at that time we didn\u2019t know that those things were in effect.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-19\">\u201cQ. Then you did not advise him that he had a constitutional right not to make any statement?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-20\">\u201cA. I did not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-21\">\u201cQ. And if he did, they could be used against him in a court of law ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-22\">\u201cA. I did not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-23\">\u201cMR. COLEMAN: Thank you, that\u2019s all.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-24\">\u201cMR. COLEMAN: Judge, I further object to any statements that might have been made by Mr. Early. It has been the law of this land long before the recent Supreme Court cases that the defendant had to at least be apprised of the fact that any thing he might say could be used against him. In this case, they didn\u2019t even advise him of his most basic elementary constitutional rights.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-25\">\u201cTHE COURT: Overruled. MR. COLEMAN: Exception.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-27\">\u201c(Jury returned to the Jury Box)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-28\">\u201cA. Mr. Romagnano, the last question I asked you I think referred to what was said by the defendant, under those circumstances, and in the room, and under the conditions you have testified about?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-29\">\u201cA. I asked him how much he paid for the pills \u2014 -</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-30\">\u201cMR. COLEMAN: I\u2019m going to obj ect on the grounds that it is incompetent, irrelevant, immaterial, improper predicate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>has been laid, and there is no showing that the defendant was apprised of his constitutional rights not to make a statement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-5\">\u201cTHE COURT: Overruled. MR. COLEMAN: Exception.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-7\">\u201cA. He said $25.00 a bottle.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-8\">\u201cQ. Anything else?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-9\">\u201cA. I asked him who he was going to sell them to, and he said he was going to sell them to Coy Rathel.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-10\">\u201cQ. That was the companion he had?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ajq\">\u201cA. Yes sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-11\">\u201cQ. Was Coy Rathel in the room at that time?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-12\">\u201cA. No, he was in the other room.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-13\">\u201cQ. But this man [defendant] did admit that he had paid $25.00 a bottle for them ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-14\">\u201cA. Yes sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-15\">\u201cQ. I\u2019ll ask you if you found attached to that bottle a prescription from anyone who purported to be a doctor of medicine, or anything like that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-16\">\u201cA. There was no prescription label on the bottle.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-17\">\u201cQ. No prescription label, \u2014 are you certain of that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-18\">\u201cA. Yes sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-19\">\u201cQ. You looked for it on the bottle?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A2a\">\u201cA. Yes sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-20\">\u201cQ. Did the defendant produce, or offer to produce any prescription, or copy of a prescription, or any authorization of any type from a medical doctor?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-21\">\u201cA. No sir, he did not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-22\">\u201cQ. Did he refer to any doctor, or refer to any prescription in his conversation with you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-23\">\u201cA. No sir, he did not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-24\">\u201cQ. And as far as you personally know, Dr. Grubbs still has the evidence about which you testified, the bottles of pills, is that right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-26\">\u201cA. Yes sir.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b493-27\"> The Supreme Court of Alabama\u2019s decision in Mathis v. State, Ala., 189 So.2d 564, was to the effect that in trials had before June 13, 1966, Escobedo v. State of Illinois, 378 U.S. 478, 84 S.Ct. 1758, 12 L. Ed.2d 977, will not be applied unless it is shown that the defendant requested counsel before being interrogated. Here no such request appears of record. See also, Philpot v. State, ante p. 326, 190 So.2d 293.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-28\">Rathel, by pushing the sack of tablets back under his seat, was prima facie in possession of them. Hence, any defect in the warrant to search Early\u2019s person was immaterial.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-29\">The judgment below is due to be</p>\n<p id=\"A1o\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b492-31\">.
