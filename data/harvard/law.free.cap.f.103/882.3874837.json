The charter was for 24 months at $1,000 per month, with an option to purchase at a stipulated price. The Earwell was built for a freighter on the Lakes, and it was the intention of the charterer to overhaul her so that she would be flt to run with other steamers on a coastwise line which it expected to establish from New York to Southern ports. The charterer was to bear all expenses, including alterations, repairs, and addition, and agreed to keep her free and clear of all liens, incumbrances, and debts. The vessel was delivered to the charterer at Buffalo, was brought through the canals and 'St. Lawrence river, and reached the foot of Twenty-Fifth street, South Brooklyn, considerably damaged by sea perils encountered on the voyage. Upon her arrival at South Brooklyn parts of her engines and other machinery were taken down and removed from the vessel, and she went out of commission. Her supply of coal was taken out, in order that changes might be made in her bunkers, and that new bulkheads might be put in. In this condition she was towed from South Brooklyn to East Fourth, borough of Manhattan, and while at the foot of East Fourth street she was further dismantled. Her system of iron piping was removed, to be replaced with copper. While she was in this condition, and while this work was going on, the claims of the libelants accrued. All of the work claimed for and all of the supplies and materials were furnished (except the supplies furnished by Fieman) while the steamship was lying at the foot of East Fourth street.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-4\">The following propositions seem to be established by authority:</p>\n<p id=\"b895-5\">(1) The charterer of a vessel becomes the owner pro hac vice to such an extent that he may bind the ship for repairs and supplies, when there is nothing in the charter restricting him in that particular.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-6\">(2) \u201cFeither reason nor public policy forbids the owner and the charterer from making\u201d an-agreement that the charterer shall supply such things, and keep the ship free of liens therefor. The Kate, 164 U. S. 465.17 Sup. Ct. 138, 41 L. Ed. 516.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-7\">(3) If the person furnishing the labor or supplies knows the terms of eh a charter, he cannot have a maritime lien upon a foreign vessel w.mn he furnishes such labor and supplies upon the order of the charterer or the charterer\u2019s servants, even though he charges them to the vessel. The Kate, supra. '</p>\n<p id=\"b895-8\">(4) The same rule will apply even if the person so furnishing labor and supplies has no knowledge of the contents of the charter-party, \u201cIf the circumstances attending the transaction put him on inquiry as to the existence and terms of such charter party, but he failed to make inquiry, and chose to act on a mere belief that the vessel would be liable for his claim.\u201d The Valencia v. Ziegler, 165 U. S. 264, 17 Sup. Ct. 323, 41 L. Ed. 710.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-9\">(5) Where supplies and repairs are ordered in a foreign port, not by the master, but by the owner, there must be some affirmative evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"884\">*884</page-number>to show that the credit of the ship was pledged as security for payment.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-4\">These propositions dispose of all the questions raised on these appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-5\">The Philip Claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-6\">The superintendent of the Manhattan Steamship Company, the charterer, went to libelant\u2019s shop, and said there was some work to be done on the steamer George Far well. Libelant asked him for whom the work was to be done. He said the Manhattan Steamship Company owned the boats. The libelant, having had some previous trouble in collecting bills, replied that he did not wish to do anything for the Manhattan Steamship Company, whereupon the superintendent said, \u201cDo it on the credit of the vessel.\u201d Hi re we have no question of the libelant being put on inquiry. He'did, in fact, inquire, and was informed by a person who ought to have known, and who was one of the charterer\u2019s agents, that there was no charter restriction. We \u00f1nd no authority which would seem even to imply that the libelant, under such circumstances, was bound to make any further inquiry, or to search the documentary title to the ship. If the result is a hardship for the owners, they, rather than the libelant, should suffer, because they turned over the possession of their ship to a charterer who allowed its agents to misrepresent the situation. We are further of the opinion that libelant was entitled to rely on Schley\u2019s direction to give credit to the ship. He was not a mere subordinate employ\u00e9, but the chief engineer and superintendent of the particular department concerned with work of the sort furnished. The claim of this libelant is, therefore, sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-7\">The Hoffmire Claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-8\">In this case the weight of evidence is to the effect that Newcomb, the general manager of the steamship company, told libelant that \u201che\u201d (meaning the company) had bought the ship, and that the work was don\u00e9 upon an express understanding with him that \u201cthe ship was good for it.\u201d The claim of this libelant is therefore sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-9\">The Pollock Claim</p>\n<p id=\"b896-10\">The supplies in this case were furnished upon the order of the purchasing agent of the Manhattan Steamship Company, who stated that the steamship company owned the George Farwell. Nothing was said between the libelant and the purchasing agent, or any person representing the steamship company, in respect to a pledge of the vessel, and there are no circumstances in the case from which an understanding that the vessel was to be pledged for the supplies can be implied. The case is exactly as though the supplies had been ordered by the owner in person, and the presumption is that they were furnished upon the owner\u2019s credit, and not upon the credit of the vessel. They were charged to the steamer and owners. The libelant never saw the steamer, and did not know whether she was a domestic or foreign vessel. The case is merely one where the libelant, as was its usual custom, charged the supplies to the steamer and her owner. The decree in this case must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"885\">*885</page-number>The Tregarthen Claim. \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"b897-4\">The repairs were made pursuant to an agreement with Newcomb, tine manager of the Manhattan Steamship Company, or with the port captain. Tlie libelants did not concern themselves to find out whether the vessel was foreign or domestic, did not know whether the Manhattan Steamship Company was a foreign or domestic corporation, and supposed that New York was the home port of the vessel, and that she was owned either by a New York corporation, or by an individual resident of New York. They knew that she was being generally overhauled. The supplies were charged <em>to </em>the steamer. This case, like the Pollock case, is one where the sup \u00a1dies were furnished without, any agreement for a lien, express or implied, and upon the supposition that they were ordered by the owner in person at the home port of the vessel. The decree should be; reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-5\">The Nieman Claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-6\">The libelant sold meats and groceries to the vessel on the order of the steward. He knew the home port; of the vessel was Cleveland. He made no inquiries as to whether she was chartered, or on what terms. There is no other evidence as to this claim, which is not established by proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-7\">The decrees of the district court, iu the Pollock, Tregarthen and Nieman claims are reversed, and causes remitted to that court:, with instructions to decree in accordance with this opinion. Costs to appellants. The decree in the Philip and Hoffmire claims are affirmed, with interest and costs.</p>\n<author id=\"b897-8\">SHIPMAN, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"AxWe\">I agree with the conclusions expressed by Judge LACOMKE in all the cases except in the Tregarthen claim, in regard to which I think that the facts require an affirmance of the decree; of the district court. Tregarthen is a member of a firm of shipwrights, and was told, through Hoffmire, another libelant, and whose lien upon the steamship has been established, that the owners of the ship wanted work done upon her. Tregarthen\u2019s testimony is thereafter as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b897-9\">\u201cI then went to the steamer, and saw the captain, and said I heard the owners wished some work done on the ship. He said, \u2018Yes, wanted some new guards on,\u2019 and so forth, and sent me to the port captain. I saw him, and he said that the new guards were wanted around the ship. I asked about the owner. He said, \u2018Manhattan Steamship Company.\u2019 He said, \u2018Why, the ship is good enough for your bill.' That was Captain Holton, port captain, who said that. I gave an estimate, and the next day he agreed to it, and we started work. Newcomb, superintendent, or something, said we should get pay as soon as the, work was done: said, We have brought a few other vessels here.\u2019 Contract price was $250.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b897-10\">Holton, the port captain, had charge; of the repairs on the deck of the vessel, and to him the captain was subordinate. The captain said that the owners wanted deck repairs; sent Tregarthen to Holton for information, who said that the Manhattan Steamship Company was the owner, and \u201cthe ship is good enough for your bill\u201d; agreed to Tregarihen\u2019s estimate; and, after an interview with Newcomb, the superintendent, who made promises in regard to the time of payment, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"886\">*886</page-number>the work was started. It is true that Tregarthen thought that the vessel was owned by a New York corporation, of whose pecuniary character or responsibility he was ignorant, and it is evident to me from his conversation with Holton, who was in immediate charge of the repairs, and to whom he was sent by the captain for information, that the work was done upon the credit of the vessel, and that the libelants supposed that they had a'lien upon her under the New York statute. Tregarthen made all the necessary inquiries in regard to the own\u00e9rship of the vessel, and was not bound to make further search for documentary title; and, in my opinion, did the work with as much reliance upon the credit of the vessel, and as adequate a right to rely upon her, as did either Philip or Hoffmire, although he did not obtain from the general manager a confirmation of Holton\u2019s declaration that the vessel was liable.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
