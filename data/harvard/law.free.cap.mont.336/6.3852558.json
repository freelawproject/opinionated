Archambault now appeals his two assault convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-10\">\u00b62 The sole issue raised in this appeal is whether the District Court committed reversible error by refusing to give Archambault\u2019s proposed jury instruction regarding the issue of justifiable use of force.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-11\">\u00b63 We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-12\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b31-13\">\u00b64 The two felony assault convictions at issue stem from Archambault\u2019s admitted act of firing a .22 caliber handgun toward Luella Roberts (\u201cRoberts\u201d) and Billie Miller (\u201cMiller\u201d). Prior to this incident, Archambault testified, he had purchased methamphetamine from Roberts on a regular basis for over six months until a dispute arose from one of these transactions. According to Archambault, Roberts provided him with an ounce of poor quality methamphetamine, which he refused to pay for, and she subsequently began to threaten and harass him, at one point calling him \u201ca walking dead man.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b31-14\">\u00b65 On August 10, 2002, Archambault drove his minivan to Roberts\u2019 residence located at the end of Old Blue Creek Road, a gravel road which runs for roughly 1.5 miles along the Yellowstone River south of River Front Park in Billings. At trial Archambault testified that he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>made this trip in order to inform Roberts that he was moving out o\u00ed Billings \u201cand just to see if there was anything I could do to patch things up.\u201d Archambault further testified that he brought along the two passengers in his van, Paul Underwood (\u201cUnderwood\u201d) and Amber White Bear (\u201cWhite Bear\u201d), in order to \u201chave some kind of witnesses in case something happened.\u201d The group arrived at Roberts\u2019 residence at approximately 10:45 a.m., at which time Roberts and Miller were inside the home taking a break from their jobs at a nearby hotel.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-4\">\u00b66 Upon arrival, Archambault positioned his van closely behind Roberts\u2019 vehicle, a half-ton pickup truck, which was parked in front of the home\u2019s garage. Miller and Roberts then emerged from the house and entered the truck. Roberts demanded that Archambault move his van, which he did after she began to back up towards him. Archambault then drove away from the residence. Roberts claimed she followed him because Old Blue Creek Road is the only road leading from her residence back into Billings, and she and Miller needed to return to work at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-5\">\u00b67 As to the subsequent events, trial testimony was inconsistent. Roberts testified that she collided with the rear end of Archambault\u2019s van after he slowed to a stop at a point where she could not drive around it. Roberts also testified that only one collision occurred and that she caused it intentionally because she was angry with Archambault and was late for work. As for the force of the impact, Roberts testified that it was \u201c[n]ot real hard, just enough to, you know, kind of wake him up a little bit and tell him to get out of the way because he had stopped his van.\u201d Further, Roberts testified that Archambault fired three shots toward her truck after the collision. She stated that he fired the first shot while sitting in the driver\u2019s seat of the van, and that he fired the next two shots while facing toward her with his upper body out of the driver\u2019s side window as the van was still proceeding along Old Blue Creek Road.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-6\">\u00b68 Archambault testified that Roberts collided with his van twice; that these collisions occurred while the van was moving forward; that the second collision occurred while he was driving at over forty miles per hour; and that the second collision was of such force that it caused him to temporarily lose control of the vehicle. As for his use of the gun, Archambault testified that he did not at any time shoot directly at Roberts or Miller. He testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b32-7\">And then right after she hit me [the second time] I got [the van] back under control. ... I held my arm out the window to let her see I was armed. . . . And she just kept coming. She didn\u2019t <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>want to back off at all. She got in right behind me again real close. So at that time I didn\u2019t think she was taking me seriously so I aimed it in the air and fired off a shot.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b33-4\">Archambault further testified that after he fired this shot, Roberts \u201cwas still trying to come at me again, so at that point I leaned out the window, and I just figured my next move would be one [shot] above her head, so I pointed [the gun] in her direction.\u201d Additionally, Archambault stated that he had directed Underwood to take control of the steering wheel as he attempted to fire a second shot while leaning out the window. However, Archambault asserted, the gun misfired on this second attempt.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-5\">\u00b69 Miller, the passenger riding in Roberts\u2019 truck, corroborated Roberts\u2019 testimony that Archambault fired three shots. Underwood and White Bear, the passengers riding in Archambault\u2019s van, both testified that Archambault fired two shots. Miller, Underwood, and White Bear all corroborated Roberts\u2019 testimony that the truck collided with the van only once.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-6\">\u00b610 After Archambault fired bis gun toward Roberts and Miller, Roberts turned her truck around and proceeded back to her residence where she called 9-1-1 and reported Archambault\u2019s conduct. When law enforcement officers located Archambault shortly thereafter, he fled in his van briefly before surrendering.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-7\">\u00b611 The State charged Archambault with one misdemeanor count of eluding a peace officer, one felony count of assault with a weapon as to Roberts, and one felony count of assault with a weapon as to Miller. A three-day trial was held in April of 2003 and, as noted above, Archambault was convicted on all counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-8\">\u00b612 The District Court sentenced Archambault to a term of six months imprisonment pursuant to his conviction for eluding a peace officer, and two terms of twenty years imprisonment pursuant to his two convictions for assault with a weapon, with all terms to run concurrently. In doing so, the court noted Archambault\u2019s history of violent conduct, his involvement with the drug trade, his six prior felony convictions, and his nineteen prior misdemeanor convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"As\">\u00b613 On appeal, Archambault seeks a new trial, claiming that the District Court erred in instructing the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-9\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b33-10\">\u00b614 In considering whether a district court has erred in instructing the jury, we determine whether the instructions, taken as a whole, fully and fairly instruct the jury regarding the applicable law. <em>State v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number><em>Courville, </em>2002 MT 330, \u00b6 15, 313 Mont. 218, \u00b6 15, 61 P.3d 749, \u00b6 15. If the district court has rendered instructions that are erroneous in some aspect, the mistake must prejudicially affect the defendant\u2019s substantial rights in order to constitute a reversible error. <em>Courville, </em>\u00b6 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b34-5\">\u00b615 The defense theory of \u201cjustifiable use of force\u201d is an affirmative defense. Section 45-3-115, MCA. The elements of this defense are delineated in \u00a7 45-3-102, MCA, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b34-6\">Use of force in defense of person. A person is justified in the use of force or threat to use force against another when and to the extent that he reasonably believes that such conduct is necessary to defend himself or another against such other\u2019s imminent use of unlawful force. However, he is justified in the use of force likely to cause death or serious bodily harm only if he reasonably believes that such force is necessary to prevent imminent death or serious bodily harm to himself or another or to prevent the commission of a forcible felony.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b34-7\">The phrase \u201cforce likely to cause death or serious bodily harm\u201d used in this statute includes, but is not limited to, \u201cthe firing of a firearm in the direction of a person, even though no purpose exists to kill or inflict serious bodily harm\u201d and \u201cthe firing of a firearm at a vehicle in which a person is riding.\u201d Section 45-3-101(1), MCA. As we observed in <em>State </em>v. <em>Stone, </em>266 Mont. 345, 347, 880 P.2d 1296, 1298 (1994), \u00a7 45-3-102, MCA, \u201callows a person to use force to defend himself or herself in a degree commensurate with the threat of harm the person faces.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b34-8\">\u00b616 At trial, Archambault relied on the \u201cjustifiable use of force\u201d defense. Among other things, he testified that his van \u201cwould have rolled\u201d had he not been able to regain control after Roberts intentionally \u201crammed\u201d into it. He also testified that he believed Roberts was going to hit his van a third time and he \u201crealized that there was no way of getting away.\u201d Accordingly, Archambault stated, he acted out of fear when he used his gun to \u201cdefend\u201d himself and his passengers. Further, defense counsel argued in closing that Archambault \u2018believed [his use of the gun] was the only way that he could back [Roberts] off.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b34-9\">\u00b617 The District Court submitted two instructions to the jury regarding Archambault\u2019s defense theory. The first, Instruction No. 10, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b34-10\">Justifiable Use of Force as a Defense</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b35-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>The defense of justifiable use of force is an affirmative defense and the defendant has the burden of producing sufficient evidence on the issue to raise a reasonable doubt of his guilt.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b35-4\">If you find that he was justified in the use of force, you must find him not guilty on the assault counts.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b35-5\">The second, Instruction No. 11, was nearly a verbatim recitation of \u00a7 45-3-102, MCA. It stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b35-6\">Use of Force in Defense of a Person</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b35-7\">A person is justified in the use of force or threat to use force when and to the extent that he reasonably believes that such conduct is necessary to defend himself against the imminent use of unlawful force.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b35-8\">However, a person is justified in the use of force which is intended or likely to cause death or serious bodily harm only if he reasonably believes that such force is necessary to prevent imminent death or serious bodily harm.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b35-9\">\u00b618 During the settling of instructions, Archambault\u2019s counsel argued that the language of the statute would be \u201cless than clear to jurors\u201d and should therefore be restated as \u201can issue-type of instruction.\u201d Counsel proposed that the following instruction be submitted to the jury:<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b35-10\">The defendant has pleaded justification in the use of force in this case. The defendant has the burden of producing sufficient evidence of justification in the use of force to raise a reasonable doubt of his guilt. You are to consider the following requirements of the law in determining whether the use of force claimed by defendant was justified:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b35-11\">1) The defendant must not be the aggressor;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b35-12\">2) The danger of harm to the defendant must be a present one[;]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b35-13\">3) The force threatened against the defendant must be unlawful;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b35-14\">4) The defendant must actually believe that the danger exists, that is, use of force by him is necessary to avert the danger and that the kind and amount of force which defendant uses is necessary;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b35-15\">5) The defendant\u2019s belief, in each of the aspects described, is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>reasonable even if it is mistaken.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b36-4\">You are further advised that even if you determine the use of force by defendant was not justified, the state still has the duty to prove each of the elements of the crime charged beyond a reasonable doubt.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b36-5\">\u00b619 The District Court refused to give this instruction. In doing so, the court concluded that the language of given Instruction No. 11, which essentially recited \u00a7 45-3-102, MCA, was not confusing. Additionally, the court concluded that Archambault\u2019s proposed instruction was \u201cinconsistent with the law.\u201d In explaining this conclusion, the court stated that the proposed instruction \u201cwould grant the defendant more leeway than he actually has under the law\u201d because it \u201callows the defendant to act on his belief that he might be entitled to use deadly force against a threat that was less than deadly, and simply unlawful.\u201d Further, despite concluding that Archambault\u2019s proposed instruction was \u201cinconsistent with the law,\u201d the District Court also concluded, paradoxically, that the contents of that instruction were covered in Instructions No. 10 and 11 which the court had already decided to submit to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-6\">\u00b620 Archambault now argues that the District Court erred by refusing to submit his proposed instruction to the jury. In support of this argument, Archambault states that this instruction is a verbatim recitation of Montana Criminal Jury Instruction (\u201cMCJI\u201d) No. 3-110, which this Court has explicitly approved. Further, Archambault contends that the given Instruction No. 11 did not fully and fairly instruct the jury because it merely recited the \u201cabstract\u201d language of \u00a7 45-3-102, MCA, rather than setting out a list of the elements of justifiable use of force. Therefore, Archambault contends, the omission of the five elements contained in his proposed instruction limited his ability to present a defense based on the theory of justifiable use of force. Upon these contentions, Archambault seeks a new trial with MCJI No. 3-110 to be submitted to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-7\">\u00b621 Archambault\u2019s proposed instruction was, in all consequential aspects, a verbatim recitation of MCJI No. 3-110. This instruction is based on language that Justice Sheehy proposed in his concurrence in <em>State v. Graves, </em>191 Mont. 81, 96-97, 622 P.2d 203, 211-12 (1981).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>Justice Sheehy reasoned that merely instructing a jury with the language of \u00a7 45-3-102, MCA, provides the jury with</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b37-4\">an abstract statement which is of little use in its determinations. In cases where the use of justified force is claimed by the defendant, the jury, at least where the evidence supports it, should be given an Instruction that sets out the elements which are to be considered in determining whether the force was justified.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b37-5\"><em>Graves, </em>191 Mont. at 96, 622 P.2d at 211. Following this statement, Justice Sheehy listed five elements which he derived from \u00a7 45-3-102, MCA. <em>Graves, </em>191 Mont. at 96, 622 P.2d at 211-12. Those elements, with minor revisions, are now contained in MCJI No. 3-110.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-6\">\u00b622  In <em>Stone </em>we held that MCJI No. 3-110, which we referred to as \u201cthe <em>Graves </em>instruction,\u201d supplements the \u201cbare\u201d language of \u00a7 45-3-102, MCA, and constitutes an accurate representation of the law of justifiable use of force. <em>Stone, </em>266 Mont. at 348-50, 880 P.2d at 1298-99. Subsequently, in <em>State v. Claric, </em>271 Mont. 141, 146, 894 P.2d 946, 949-50 (1995),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> we noted this holding in <em>Stone </em>and reiterated that the <em>Graves </em>instruction constitutes an accurate statement of law. Therefore, the District Court erroneously concluded that Archambault\u2019s proposed instruction was inconsistent with the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-7\">\u00b623 However, while <em>Stone </em>holds that the <em>Graves </em>instruction accurately represents the law, <em>Stone </em>does not mandate that this particular formulation of the elements of justifiable use of force must be utilized when instructing a jury. Nor does <em>Stone </em>hold that the <em>Graves </em>instruction adds anything substantive to the statutory language which would be necessary to properly guide a jury. Indeed, this Court is not at liberty to introduce additional elements to the statute. Section 1-2-101, MCA (courts may not insert what has been omitted from statutes or omit what has been inserted). Rather, the recitation of elements contained in the <em>Graves </em>instruction simply constitutes a restatement of \u00a7 45-3-102, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-8\">\u00b624 Moreover, in <em>State v. White, </em>202 Mont. 491, 498, 658 P.2d 1111, 1115 (1983), we held that the same basic language as was used in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>Instruction No. 11 in this case, which essentially recites \u00a7 45-3-102, MCA, \u201csets forth in full the requisite elements\u201d of justifiable use of force \u201cin a sufficient manner to guide the jury.\u201d Although <em>Stone </em>was decided subsequently, it did not overrule this holding in <em>White. </em>Thus, pursuant to <em>Stone </em>and <em>White, </em>both the <em>Graves </em>instruction and the language of \u00a7 45-3-102, MCA, provide adequate guidance to a jury regarding the elements of justifiable use of force. And, while the <em>Graves </em>instruction may arguably be more comprehensible for a jury, we have not required district courts to utilize it when instructing a jury regarding a defendant\u2019s claim that his or her use of force was justified.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-4\">\u00b625  As we have held, district courts are accorded broad discretion in formulating jury instructions. <em>State v. Hall, </em>1999 MT 297, \u00b6 39, 297 Mont. 111, \u00b6 39, 991 P.2d 929, \u00b6 39. This broad discretion is reflected in various rules we have developed over the years, including the following: (1) while district courts must instruct the jury on each theory which is supported by the record, the defendant is not entitled to have the jury instructed on every nuance of his or her theory of the case, <em>Claric, 271 </em>Mont. at 145, 894 P.2d at 949; (2) the fact that one instruction, standing alone, was not as complete or accurate as it could have been is not reversible error, <em>Stone, </em>266 Mont. at 350, 880 P.2d at 1299; and (3) district courts may refuse to give a requested instruction if its contents are adequately covered by the given instructions-i.e., it is not necessary to give repetitive instructions, <em>State v. DuBray, </em>2003 MT 255, \u00b6 92, 317 Mont. 377, \u00b6 92, 77 P.3d 247, \u00b6 92. Yet, while the district courts\u2019 discretion is broad, it is ultimately restricted by the overriding principle that jury instructions must fully and fairly instruct the jury regarding the applicable law. <em>Hall, </em>\u00b6 39.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-5\">\u00b626 With this rule as our touchstone, we note that Archambault does not claim the given Instruction No. 11 was inaccurate in any way. In fact, he fails to address our decision in <em>White. </em>Instead, Archambault relies on Justice Sheehy\u2019s argument that the \u201cabstract\u201d language of \u00a7 45-3-102, MCA, should be fashioned into a list of elements in order to assist the jury in its determination. Archambault\u2019s argument is not without merit. Indeed, we have stated that \u201cwhere our criminal code uses language which is not common to every day usage it becomes necessary to add explanation so the jurors will understand the law under which they are to decide the case.\u201d <em>State v. Campbell, </em>160 Mont. 111, 114, 500 P.2d 801, 803 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b38-6\">\u00b627 However, to merely demonstrate that the <em>Graves </em>instruction might be more comprehensible to a jury than the statutory language, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>as Archambault attempts to do here, is to skirt the pertinent issue. Our task on review is not to determine whether the District Court chose the better of two legally proper instructions. Nor is our task to determine whether the court formulated the instructions in the best possible way. Rather, as noted above, we must simply consider whether the given instructions fully and fairly instructed the jury regarding the applicable law. <em>Courville, </em>\u00b6 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-4\">\u00b628  In summary, <em>White </em>holds that the language of given Instruction No. 11 fully sets forth the requisite elements of justifiable use of force in a manner sufficient to guide the jury, and <em>Stone </em>did not overrule <em>White </em>despite approving the <em>Graves </em>instruction. Further, Archambault has failed to demonstrate that our decision in <em>White </em>was erroneous. Accordingly, we conclude that the District Court did not err in instructing the jury because Instruction No. 11 folly and fairly set forth the applicable elements of Archambault\u2019s affirmative defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b39-6\">\u00b629 Having concluded that the District Court did not err in instructing the jury, we affirm Archambault\u2019s two assault convictions.</p>\n<judges id=\"b39-7\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES WARNER and RICE concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b31-15\"> The pre-sentence investigation report in this case states that Archambault is also known as Marlon Villagecenter.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b35-16\"> Pursuant to <em>State </em>v. <em>Grimes, </em>1999 MT 145, \u00b6\u00b6 37-39, 295 Mont. 22, \u00b6\u00b6 37-39, 982 P.2d 1037, \u00b6\u00b6 37-39, the proposal of this instruction adequately preserved Archambault\u2019s opportunity to argue the issue he has presented for review on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b36-8\"> Our decision in <em>State v.

While I believe that the <em>Graves </em>instruction better explains the \u201cjustifiable use of force\u201d defense, I would not find reversible error in the trial court\u2019s discretionary refusal to give the instruction in this case. On the facts here, the other self-defense instructions that were given adequately instructed on Archambault\u2019s theory of defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-10\">\u00b631 That said, I suggest that it is a mistake not to provide the trial courts with some guidance as to when it is appropriate to give the <em>Graves </em>instruction and when it is not necessary. I suspect that there is, and will continue to be, a constant tension between accused persons-who will invariably want the instruction-and prosecutors-who will invariably not want the instruction. I also believe that trial courts are more inclined to give minimum instructional guidance to the jury, rather than more, with the result that the <em>Graves </em>instruction will remain on the books as good law, but, as here, with little practical import for the defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-11\">\u00b632 For example, it may be appropriate to require the <em>Graves </em>instruction in cases where there is a factual dispute over whether the accused or the victim was the aggressor, or where there is a factual dispute involving the imminence of the danger or threat against which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>the accused is defending himself or herself. Similarly, it may be appropriate to require the instruction where, there is a factual dispute involving the accused\u2019s objective or subjective belief about the danger being defended against.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-4\">\u00b633 To be sure, the statutory <em>(White) </em>instruction and the <em>Graves </em>instruction do not contain identical information-i.e., where the giving of one would simply be cumulative of the other. The <em>Graves </em>instruction actually provides the jury more information than does the <em>White </em>instruction and, in my view, better focuses the jury\u2019s attention on the elements of the defense. Certainly judges and lawyers are proficient at reading through a statute-e.g., the <em>White </em>instruction-and picking out elements or facts that need to be proven. Most lay jurors are not so adept, and, especially in complicated cases involving self-defense, it may be critical that the jurors be instructed in the more informative and \u201ccook-book\u201d fashion that the <em>Graves </em>instruction provides. In those cases, the <em>Graves </em>instruction should be required.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-5\">\u00b634 Given that we have not provided this guidance to the district courts, it will be up to defense counsel to not only offer the <em>Graves </em>instruction, but to also make an on-the-record showing of why the instruction is required, by reference to specific factual disputes necessitating the instruction. Only then will the accused have a reasonable chance of receiving the benefit of the instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-6\">\u00b635 With that caveat, I concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
