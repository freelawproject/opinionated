Dutton appeals and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-24\">\u00b62 The issue on appeal is whether the application for a search <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>warrant established probable cause for the Justice Court to issue the search warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-4\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b217-5\">\u00b63 On December 1, 2004, Lincoln County Sheriffs Office detective Shane Hight asked the Lincoln County Justice Court to issue a warrant to search property owned by Douglas Dutton. Hight\u2019s application for a search warrant began by outlining his eight years of experience as a peace officer and over 100 hours of training in the area of dangerous drugs. The application stated Hight had been specifically assigned to investigate and enforce Montana\u2019s dangerous drug laws since July of 2004. It then set forth the following facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-6\">\u00b64 In March of 2004, Crime Stoppers received an anonymous letter describing a clandestine drug lab run by Dutton at his home, for which the writer provided the street address. In July of 2004, Hight and another detective inquired at a local convenience store where a store clerk told them a man named Doug came in and bought bottles of HEET and two or three boxes of matches at a time. The clerk gave the detectives a vehicle license number which they determined was registered to Dutton. On November 20, 2004, a Troy, Montana, police officer filed a report stating Dutton had purchased-at three different stores on the same day-precursors needed to manufacture methamphetamine: two boxes of pseudoephedrine, hydrogen peroxide, 4 boxes of matches and a bottle of HEET.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-7\">\u00b65 Several days after receiving that report, Hight researched property ownership records in Lincoln County and obtained the address of reed property and a trailer owned by Dutton, which was the same address contained in the anonymous letter to Crime Stoppers. Two days later, Hight was contacted by another officer who told him Dutton had purchased two boxes of matches and a bottle of HEET at an area convenience store. On November 26, 2004, Hight observed Dutton go into the local IGA store, where he purchased nasal decongestant and matches. Four days later, another detective collected a receipt from a local hardware store where Dutton had purchased Red Devil lye, paper towels, and a box of pseudoephedrine tablets. Finally, Hight stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b217-8\">Through training and experience, your Affiant has reason to believe that Dutton is operating a clandestine lab in which he is manufacturing methamphetamine. The amount of pseudoephedrine hydrochloride, HEET, matches, Lye and other essential items are well beyond the amount consistent with normal household consumption.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b218-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>Hight attached to his application for a search warrant a brochure prepared by the Montana Department of Justice, which identified matches, engine starter, Red Devil lye, and pseudoephedrine tablets as substances frequently found at methamphetamine lab sites.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-4\">\u00b66 The Justice Court issued a search warrant for the premises, curtilage, outbuildings and vehicles at Dutton\u2019s address. Based on items found during the search, the State of Montana charged Dutton by Information filed in the District Court with criminal production or manufacture of dangerous drugs, operating an unlawful clandestine laboratory, criminal possession of precursors to dangerous drugs, felony and misdemeanor criminal possession of dangerous drugs, and use or possession of property subject to criminal forfeiture.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">\u00b67 Dutton moved to suppress the evidence seized in the search, arguing that the pre-November of2004 events set forth in the warrant application were stale and that the remainder of the application did not constitute sufficient probable cause to invade his right to privacy. The District Court rejected Dutton\u2019s staleness argument and ruled that, under the totality of the circumstances, the Justice Court did not err in concluding the application for a search warrant established probable cause to believe evidence of a crime would be discovered at Dutton\u2019s property.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-6\">\u00b68 Dutton and the State entered into an agreement pursuant to which Dutton pled guilty to the manufacture or production of dangerous drugs and the State agreed to dismiss the remaining charges against him. The District Court entered judgment, and Dutton appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-7\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b218-8\">\u00b69 Courts review the issuance of a search warrant to insure that the issuing judicial officer had a substantial basis to determine that probable cause existed. <em>State v. Barnaby, </em>2006 MT 203, \u00b6 30, 333 Mont. 220, \u00b6 30, 142 P.3d 809, \u00b6 30 (citation omitted). In other words, district courts reviewing the issuance of search warrants by justice courts utilize the same standard as this Court uses in reviewing search warrants issued by district courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-9\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b218-10\">\u00b610 Did the application for a search warrant establish probable cause for the Justice Court to issue the search warrant?</p>\n<p id=\"b218-11\">\u00b611 The Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Article II, Section 11 of the Montana Constitution allow a judge or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>magistrate to issue a warrant to search a person or that person\u2019s home, papers or effects only upon a showing of probable cause. We use the \u201ctotality of the circumstances\u201d test set forth in <em>Illinois v. Gates, </em>462 U.S. 213, 103 S.Ct. 2317 (1983), to determine whether probable cause exists. <em>See Barnaby, </em>\u00b6 29. Under that test, the issuing judicial officer must make a practical, common-sense decision, given all the circumstances set forth in the affidavit, including the veracity and basis of knowledge of persons supplying hearsay information, of whether there is a fair probability that contraband or evidence of a crime will be found in the place described in the affidavit. <em>Barnaby, </em>\u00b6 29, <em>citing Gates, </em>462 U.S. at 238, 103 S.Ct. at 2332.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-4\">\u00b612 Dutton claims the application for a search warrant in this case was defective in two respects. He first argues that the information in the Crime Stoppers tip from March of2004 was stale, advancing <em>State v. Anderson, </em>1999 MT 60, 293 Mont. 490, 977 P.2d 983.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">\u00b613 In <em>Anderson, </em>our discussion of staleness related to an informant\u2019s tip that the defendant had been arrested on two prior occasions-five years earlier, and again seven months earlier-for possession of marijuana with intent to sell. We concluded the information about the prior arrests was not stale when considered together with the discovery of methamphetamine, moments before the search of the defendant\u2019s person, pursuant to a warrant to search the trailer where the defendant was living. <em>Anderson, </em>\u00b6 15. We noted that a determination of whether information is too stale to be considered in establishing probable cause depends largely on the nature of the activity at issue. We further noted that, where information reveals that the possession and distribution of dangerous drugs by a person is a protracted and continuing activity, the passage of time between the conduct and the probable cause determination becomes less significant. <em>Anderson, </em>\u00b6 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-6\">\u00b614 The staleness discussion in <em>Anderson </em>does not support Dutton\u2019s arguments. Indeed, it establishes that the issuing Justice Court properly considered the Crime Stopper tip from March of 2004. Here, the Crime Stopper tip was received nine months before the search warrant was issued. In addition to that incident, the application for a search warrant also included information about an incident five months before the warrant was issued and considerable information that was only days or weeks old at the time of the warrant application. We conclude the District Court correctly rejected Dutton\u2019s staleness argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-7\">\u00b615 Dutton also claims the warrant application is \u201crife with speculation,\u201d citing <em>State v. Reesman, </em>2000 MT 243, 301 Mont. 408, 10 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>P.3d 83, <em>overruled in part, Barnaby, </em>\u00b6 42, for the principle that a tip from an anonymous source must be independently corroborated through other sources. Dutton states that \u201c[o]ther than [ ] conclusory allegation[s] based on Hight\u2019s personal opinion, there is nothing to connect Dutton\u2019s purchases to anything of a criminal nature whatsoever.\u201d Dutton apparently refers to Hight\u2019s assertion in the search warrant application that he believed Dutton was purchasing various items as precursors to manufacture of methamphetamine. \u00b616 In <em>Reesman, </em>a search warrant was issued based on information provided by a confidential informant and corroborated by an anonymous citizen. We ruled that a confidential informant\u2019s information to law enforcement officers, corroborated only by anonymous citizens, did not provide a substantial basis for a conclusion that probable cause existed to issue a search warrant. <em>Reesman, \u00b6 46 </em>(citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b220-4\">\u00b617 Dutton has not referenced anything in <em>Reesman </em>which supports his argument that the observations and opinions of Hight-an identified, trained law enforcement officer rather than a confidential informant-were an inadequate basis for issuing the search warrant. Indeed, independent police corroboration \u201crepresents a key element in determining whether probable cause exists\u201d to issue a search warrant. <em>Barnaby, </em>\u00b6 42. Here, the bulk of the information in the application for a search warrant concerned Hight\u2019s and other law enforcement officers\u2019 observations of and investigations concerning Dutton\u2019s purchases of quantities of precursors needed to manufacture methamphetamine, escalating to nearly daily observations in the days just before Hight applied for the search warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">\u00b618  The key question when evaluating probable cause is whether the application as a whole supports a determination of probable cause. <em>Barnaby, </em>\u00b6 39 (citation omitted). In reviewing the issuance of the search warrant and denying Dutton\u2019s motion to suppress, the District Court stated that \u201c[w]hen each piece of evidence in this case is viewed in conjunction with every other piece of evidence, it is disingenuous to describe Dutton\u2019s purchasing activity as consistent with the \u2018average consumer.\u2019\u201d We agree. Viewing the facts presented in the search warrant application in a practical, common-sense manner, we conclude the Justice Court had a substantial basis for determining that probable cause existed to search Dutton\u2019s address. We hold, therefore, that the District Court properly denied Dutton\u2019s motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">\u00b619 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b220-7\">JUSTICES COTTER, LEAPHART, RICE and WARNER concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
