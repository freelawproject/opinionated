Wing (Wing) appeals from an order of the Fourth Judicial District, Missoula County, granting summary judgment in favor of the State of Montana (State). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-9\">\u00b62 Wing presents two issues for review:</p>\n<p id=\"b448-10\">\u00b63 1. Whether \u00a7 2-9-301, MCA, is unconstitutionally vague.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-11\">\u00b64 2. Whether the District Court properly applied the three-year statute of limitations in granting the State\u2019s motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-12\">PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b448-13\">\u00b65 Wing was involved in a car accident on Highway 200 in Missoula County on April 27,2001. Wing sent a claim by mail on April 23,2004, to the Department of Administration (the Department), alleging that the State was responsible for the injuries that she suffered as a result of the crash. The Department received Wing\u2019s claim on April 26,2004. The Department effectively denied Wing\u2019s claim by failing to make a final disposition of the claim in writing within 120 days of Wing\u2019s presentment of her claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-14\">\u00b66 Wing filed a complaint in District Court against the State on August 26, 2004, alleging that the State\u2019s contractor failed to sign adequately a road construction zone on Highway 200 and that the lack of warning caused her car to collide with another vehicle. Wing seeks damages that she claims resulted from the crash, including medical expenses, future medical expenses, loss of earnings, future loss of earnings and earning capacity, emotional distress, pain and suffering, and the loss of established course of life.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-15\">\u00b67 The State filed an answer on September 17, 2004, denying the allegations in Wing\u2019s complaint. The State also raised an affirmative defense that the statute of limitations barred Wing\u2019s claim. The State <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>filed a motion for summary judgment on September 16,2005, arguing that Wing\u2019s untimely complaint under \u00a7 27-2-204, MCA, and \u00a7 2-9-301, MCA, warranted dismissal of her claims as a matter of law. Wing countered that she timely filed her complaint under the applicable statutes. Wing also argued that \u00a7 2-9-301, MCA, was unconstitutionally vague on its face, and thereby violated her constitutional right to due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-4\">\u00b68 The District Court granted the State\u2019s motion for summary judgment. The court determined that Wing\u2019s complaint was subject to \u00a7 27-2-204, MCA, the statute prescribing a three-year period for the filing of tort actions, and \u00a7 2-9-301, MCA, the statute that tolls the statute of limitations for a period of 120 days when the claimant provides notice to the State of the claim. The court applied the two statutes using the method provided in M. R. Civ. P. 6. The court determined that Wing\u2019s cause of action expired on August 25, 2004, just one day before Wing filed her complaint. The court also ruled that \u00a7 2-9-301, MCA, was not unconstitutionally vague. Wing appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b449-6\">\u00b69 We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment. <em>Gulf Insurance Co. v. Clark, </em>2001 MT 45, \u00b6 12, 304 Mont. 264, \u00b6 12, 20 P.3d 780, \u00b6 12. We apply the same standard used by the district court as set forth in M. R. Civ. P. 56. <em>Gulf Insurance Co., </em>\u00b6 12. We review for correctness the district court\u2019s application of the statute of limitations. <em>Gulf Insurance </em>Co., \u00b6 13. We exercise plenary review of constitutional questions. <em>In re Custody and Parental Rights of D.S., </em>2005 MT 275, \u00b6 15, 329 Mont. 180, \u00b6 15, 122 P.3d 1239, \u00b6 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b449-8\">\u00b610 <em>Whether \u00a7 2-9-301, MCA, is unconstitutionally vague.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b449-9\">\u00b611 Wing argues that \u00a7 2-9-301, MCA, is unconstitutionally vague in that it first directs a claimant to \u201cpresent\u201d a claim to the Department and then tolls the statute of limitations upon the Department\u2019s \u201creceipt\u201d of such claim. Wing contends that a person of ordinary intelligence would not know whether the statute of limitations tolls from the time the claim was presented to the Department or when the Department actually received the claim. Wing further argues that the Department\u2019s failure to provide notice of its receipt of a claim makes it impossible for a person of ordinary intelligence to calculate when the tolling period begins.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>\u00b612  Statutes carry a presumption of constitutionality. <em>In re Custody and Parental Rights of D.S., </em>\u00b6 15. The party challenging the statute carries the burden of proving the statute\u2019s unconstitutionality beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>In re Custody and Parental Rights of D.S., </em>\u00b6 15. A non-criminal statute is unconstitutionally vague if a person of common intelligence must guess at its meaning. <em>Montana Media, Inc. v. Flathead County, </em>2003 MT 23, \u00b6 58, 314 Mont. 121, \u00b6 58, 63 P.3d 1129, \u00b6 58. We presume that a person of average intelligence can comprehend a term of common usage contained in a statute. <em>State v. Trull, </em>2006 MT 119, \u00b6 33, 332 Mont. 233, \u00b6 33, 136 P.3d 551, \u00b6 33.</p>\n<p id=\"Ask\">\u00b613 Section 2-9-301(2), MCA, prohibits a claimant from filing an action against the State in district court without first presenting the claim to the Department. The statute tolls the applicable statute of limitations for 120 days. The tolling period begins upon the Department\u2019s <em>\u201creceipt </em>of the claim.\u201d Section 2-9-301, MCA (emphasis added). \u201cReceipt\u201d constitutes a term of common usage that does not connote an obscure or incomprehensible meaning. We presume that a person of average intelligence could comprehend that the term \u201creceipt\u201d as used in \u00a7 2-9-301, MCA, means that the statute of limitations tolls when the Department actually receives the claim. <em>See The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language </em>1458 (4th ed., Houghton Mifflin Company 2000); <em>Trull, </em>\u00b6 33. The plain language of the statute sets forth a clear time for when the tolling of the statute of limitations begins.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-4\">\u00b614 We recognize that the Department\u2019s \u201creceipt\u201d of a claim could vary, however, depending on whether the claimant chose to hand deliver the claim or to deliver the claim by mail. We do not require \u201cperfect clarity and precise guidance\u201d to uphold a statute\u2019s constitutionality. <em>In re Custody and Parental Rights of D.S., </em>\u00b6 17. We deem a statute to be unconstitutionally vague if it specifies \u201c\u2018no standard of conduct\u2019\u201d at all. <em>In re Custody and Parental Rights of D.S., </em>\u00b6 16 (quoting <em>State v. Martel, </em>273 Mont. 143, 151, 902 P.2d 14, 19 (1995)).</p>\n<p id=\"b450-5\">\u00b615  A claimant readily could determine the precise date of the Department\u2019s receipt of the claim and, thus, the commencement of the tolling period under \u00a7 2-9-301, MCA, in a number of ways. For instance, a claimant could hand deliver the claim to the Department, ensuring the exact date of the Department\u2019s receipt and the beginning of the tolling of the statute of limitations. A claimant who chooses to send the claim by mail, such as Wing, could request a return receipt from the post office to determine the exact date of the Department\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>receipt of the claim. A claimant also could contact the Department by telephone, letter, or email to inquire about the Department\u2019s receipt of the claim. Nothing in \u00a7 2-9-301, MCA, requires Wing or any other person of common intelligence to guess at when the 120-day tolling period commences under the statute. We conclude that \u00a7 2-9-301, MCA, is not unconstitutionally vague.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-4\">\u00b616 <em>Whether the District Court properly applied the three-year statute of limitations in granting the State\u2019s motion for summary judgment.</em></p>\n<p id=\"AFr\">\u00b617 Wing argues that the District Court erred in two ways in calculating the 120-day tolling period. Wing argues first that the court improperly applied M. R. Civ. P. 6(a) to calculate the 120-day tolling period. She contends that the calculation method -under M. R. Civ. P. 6(a) should not be used to reduce any days remaining under the statute of limitations. Wing next sirgues that the court should have started the tolling period from the day that she mailed the claim rather than the day that the Department received the claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">\u00b618 The parties agree that the three-year time limit provided for in \u00a7 27-2-204, MCA, applies to Wing\u2019s complaint, and that the statute of limitations governing her action would have expired on April 27,2004. The parties also agree that \u00a7 2-9-301, MCA, tolled the statute of limitations for a period of 120 days once the Department received Wing\u2019s claim. We review for correctness, therefore, the court\u2019s legal conclusion that the statute of limitations barred Wing\u2019s claim against the State. <em>Gulf Insurance </em>Co., \u00b6 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-6\">\u00b619 Wing sent notice of her claim to the Department on April 23,2004. The Department received the claim on April 26, 2004, thereby triggering the 120-day tolling period under \u00a7 2-9-301, MCA. <em>See also Gomez v. State, </em>1999 MT 67, \u00b6 12, 293 Mont. 531, \u00b6 12, 975 P.2d 1258, \u00b6 12. M. R. Civ. P. 6(a) provides the proper method for computing any period of time prescribed by \u201cany applicable statute.\u201d We do not count \u201cthe day of the act, event, or default\u201d after which the time period begins to run. M. R. Civ. P. 6(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b451-7\">\u00b620 The Department\u2019s receipt of Wing\u2019s claim on April 26, 2004, constituted the day of the act after which the 120-day tolling period began to run. The first day of the 120-day tolling period began on April 27,2004-the same day that the three-year statute of limitations would have expired in Wing\u2019s action. The 120-day tolling period lasted through August 24, 2004. We count August 24, 2004, as being within the tolling period. M. R. Civ. P. 6(a). The statute of limitations period resumed, therefore, on August 25, 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>\u00b621  The statute of limitations expired at the end of August 25, 2004, because Wing had only one day left on the three-year statute of limitations when the Department received her claim. The Department\u2019s receipt of Wing\u2019s claim triggered the 120-day tolling period. Wing filed her complaint in District Court one day too late, on August 26, 2004. We conclude that the District Court\u2019s determination that the three-year statute of limitations barred Wing\u2019s complaint was legally correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-4\">\u00b622 We turn now to Wing\u2019s claim that the tolling period should have started on the day that she mailed her claim rather than the day that the Department received her claim. As stated above, the plain language of \u00a7 2-9-301, MCA, compels the court to start the tolling period from the time that the Department receives the claim. <em>See also Gomez, </em>\u00b6 12 (applying the 120-day tolling period from the date the Department receives the claim). Moreover, applying the tolling period from the date Wing mailed the claim would not change the outcome in this case. The calculation method would have produced the same result-that the statute of limitations expired on August 25, 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">\u00b623 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b452-6\">JUSTICES WARNER, COTTER, LEAPHART and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
