We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-12\">\u00b62 The dispositive issue on appeal is whether the District Court correctly determined that evidence was obtained as a result of a private search and thus appropriately denied the motions to suppress evidence obtained during and as a result of that search.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-13\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b244-14\">\u00b63 At the time of the incidents described herein, Bryan Malkuch and Jackie Malkuch (the Malkuchs) were residents of Baker, Montana, and had two teenage children living with them, a sixteen-year-old son, D.M., and a thirteen-year-old daughter, J.M. In April of 2004, Jackie Malkuch called law enforcement officers to have D.M. removed from the family home following an argument. D.M. went to stay at Annie Thompson\u2019s home. Thompson, an adult, was a former babysitter and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>friend of the family.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-4\">\u00b64 A couple of days later, Thompson and D.M. approached a law enforcement officer, Michael Stanhope, outside a convenience store. Thompson told Officer Stanhope that Jackie was doing drugs, and asked if the police could do anything about it. Officer Stanhope told them the police would need evidence before they could do anything.</p>\n<p id=\"ATS\">\u00b65 Although D.M. had been instructed not to return to the home, Thompson and D.M. left the convenience store and went to the Malkuch home. D.M. and Thompson went through a window into the house. They searched the house, including Jackie\u2019s bedroom, and found a vial containing a white residue in Jackie\u2019s dresser drawer. Using a clean washcloth, they picked up the vial and returned to the convenience store about fifteen minutes after they left it. Officer Stanhope was still there and they gave him the vial, much to his surprise. Officer Stanhope delivered the vial to the Baker police station where the residue tested positive for methamphetamine.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">\u00b66 The next morning, Chief Randy Ketterling of the Baker Police Department and Fallon County Sheriff Tim Barkley interviewed D.M. and Thompson. D.M. told the officers that his mother spent a lot of time in her bedroom and that she had recently lost a lot of weight. He told them where he found the vial and that he also saw a butane torch in the drawer. He also stated that Bryan had recently removed a bag full of items that D.M. believed contained drug paraphernalia, but that he could not locate the bag in the search of the house or garage.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-6\">\u00b67 Thompson told the officers that D.M.\u2019s younger sister, J.M., had called her a couple months before and told her that she had seen Jackie snorting white powder with a straw off a white platter. Thompson stated that at her insistence, J.M. had then searched the house and found the empty platter with a razor blade nearby, as well as straws that were melted on one end. Thompson also stated that D.M. had told her he had found three homemade pipes in Jackie\u2019s bedroom. Thompson stated that she was concerned for the children\u2019s safety. When Chief Ketterling asked if Officer Stanhope asked her to search the dresser, she replied:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-7\">[Thompson]: No. All he said is before they can ever do anything, they need evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-9\">Chief Ketterling: Evidence, ok,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-10\">[Thompson]: Cause they just can\u2019t walk right in there...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-11\">Chief Ketterling: Right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-12\">[Thompson]: and just say ok, we need this and that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-13\">Chief Ketterling: So you guys decided to find, to get him some</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b246-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>evidence basically?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b246-4\">[Thompson]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">\u00b68 Based on the vial containing methamphetamine and Thompson\u2019s and D.M.\u2019s statements, the District Court issued a search warrant for the Malkuch residence. A drug task force officer executed the search warrant and found other drug paraphernalia in the house. The Malkuchs were charged with criminal possession of dangerous drugs, a felony, criminal possession of drug paraphernalia, and endangering the welfare of children, both misdemeanors.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-6\">\u00b69 The Malkuchs both filed motions to suppress the evidence of the methamphetamine in the vial because the officers obtained the vial without a warrant. They argued that the police officer directed Thompson and D.M. to search the house and bring him evidence, or at least that the officer cooperated with them in the search. They also argued that the application for the search warrant did not establish probable cause to believe drugs or drug paraphernalia were in the house because it was based on hearsay and stale information. The District Court denied their motions to suppress. The State dropped the child endangerment charge, and Bryan and Jackie pled nolo contendere to the drug charges and reserved their right to bring this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-7\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b246-8\">\u00b610 The standard of review of a district court\u2019s denial of a motion to suppress evidence is whether the court\u2019s findings are clearly erroneous and whether the court\u2019s interpretation and application of the law are correct. This Court\u2019s review is plenary as to whether the district court correctly interpreted and applied the law. <em>State v. </em>Wetzel, 2005 MT 154, \u00b6 10, 327 Mont. 413, \u00b6 10, 114 P.3d 269, \u00b6 10 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b246-9\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b246-10\">\u00b611 ISSUE: Did the District Court correctly deny a motion to suppress evidence obtained as a result of a private search?</p>\n<p id=\"b246-11\">\u00b612  The federal and state constitutions protect Montana citizens from unreasonable searches and seizures. U. S. Const. Amend. IV; Mont. Const, art. II, \u00a7 11. The Montana Constitution provides a greater right of privacy them the United States Constitution, and therefore \u201cprovides broader protection than the Fourth Amendment in cases involving searches of private property.\u201d <em>State v. Elison, </em>2000 MT 288, \u00b6 46, 302 Mont. 228, \u00b6 46, 14 P.3d 456, \u00b6 46. However, the privacy section of the Montana Constitution applies to state action only. <em>State </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number><em>v. Long, </em>216 Mont. 65, 71, 700 P.2d 153, 157 (1985). A search of a home conducted by private individuals does not violate a defendant\u2019s right of privacy. <em>Long, </em>216 Mont. at 71, 700 P.2d at 157. Since a private search does not infringe a right of the defendant, a warrant is not required. Section 46-5-103, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-4\">\u00b613  In <em>Long, </em>this Court held that the exclusionary rule does not apply to private searches. <em>Long, </em>216 Mont. at 71, 700 P.2d at 157. The purpose of the exclusionary rule is to \u201cdeter illegal police conduct and to preserve judicial integrity.\u201d <em>Long, </em>216 Mont. at 71, 700 P.2d at 157. When private individuals act, they are likely unaware of the exclusionary rule and its application. Accordingly, the exclusionary rule does not serve to deter private individuals from engaging in searches that would be illegal if conducted by police. <em>Long, </em>216 Mont. at 71, 700 P.2d at 157. Thus, the exclusionary rule \u201cdoes not apply to evidence resulting from the conduct of private individuals, even if felonious, unless that conduct involves state action.\u201d <em>State v. Christensen, </em>244 Mont. 312, 319, 797 P.2d 893, 897 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">\u00b614  In determining whether a private person was acting as a government agent in conducting a search, two critical factors are examined: (1) whether the government knew of and acquiesced in the intrusive conduct, and (2) whether the party performing the search intended to assist law enforcement efforts or to further his own ends. <em>U.S. v. Miller, </em>688 F.2d 652, 657 (9th Cir. 1982) (citing <em>U.S. v. Walther, </em>652 F.2d 788, 791-92 (9th Cir. 1981)).</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">\u00b615 The Malkuchs argue that the vial containing the methamphetamine was obtained illegally because Thompson and D.M. were working as agents of the police in searching the Malkuch home. They draw this conclusion from Thompson\u2019s statement that since Officer Stanhope told her the police needed evidence to do anything about Jackie\u2019s alleged drug use, she subsequently searched the house for evidence and brought it back to the officer. In response, the State points out the District Court\u2019s conclusion that there was insufficient state involvement to justify excluding the evidence. The District Court looked at the critical factors enumerated in <em>Miller, </em>and concluded that the police did not request Thompson and D.M. to do a search of the Malkuch home, nor were they aware that Thompson and D.M. were going to search the home. Thus, the police did not know of or acquiesce in the search until after it occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-7\">\u00b616  With regard to the second factor, whether the party performing the search intended to assist law enforcement efforts or to further his own ends, the court found that Thompson and D.M. carried <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>out the search because Thompson was concerned for the welfare and safety of the children. At the time Thompson and D.M. conducted the search, the police had not made any effort to investigate the Malkuchs. <em>See Miller, </em>688 F.2d at 658 (police officers invited private party to assist them in their ongoing investigative efforts). Even if D.M. and Thompson had intended to assist law enforcement efforts, they did not satisfy the first critical factor. The District Court correctly concluded that the search by Thompson and D.M. was a private search neither requested nor agreed to by the police, and therefore the evidence obtained was not subject to the exclusionary rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-4\">\u00b617 On appeal, the Malkuchs also argue that the testing of the vial without first obtaining a search warrant was an illegal search and seizure by the government. This argument was not presented to the District Court. This Court will not consider new issues or a change in legal theory for the first time on appeal, thus we decline to address this argument. <em>Wetzel, </em>\u00b6 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">\u00b618 The Malkuchs\u2019 final argument is that since the vial was obtained in an illegal search, and then relied upon to obtain the search warrant, the evidence obtained pursuant to the search warrant must be suppressed. However, because we have concluded that the vial was obtained in a private search not subject to the exclusionary rule, this argument has no merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-6\">\u00b619  The District Court\u2019s findings of fact were not clearly erroneous and it interpreted and applied the law correctly. Thus, we affirm the District Court\u2019s denial of the Malkuchs\u2019 motions to suppress evidence.</p>\n<judges id=\"b248-7\">JUSTICES COTTER, RICE, MORRIS and WARNER concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
