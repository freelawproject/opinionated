Dane\u2019s parents and brother asserted violations of Montana\u2019s Unfair Trade Practices Act by the insurer of the day care facility for misrepresenting the applicable liability limit of the insurance policy. They appeal from the judgment entered by the Thirteenth Judicial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>District Court, Yellowstone County, on its order granting summary judgment to the insurer. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-4\">\u00b62 We address the following issues:</p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">\u00b63 1. Did the District Court abuse its discretion in denying the Heggems' motion to conduct discovery on issues relating to interpretation of the insurance policy?</p>\n<p id=\"b455-7\">\u00b64 2. Did the District Court err in determining that the policy\u2019s provisions relating to the coverage available were unambiguous as a matter of law and the available policy limit was $300,000 as represented by the insurer, and in granting the insurer\u2019s motion for summary judgment on those bases?</p>\n<p id=\"b455-8\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b455-9\">\u00b65 Sabine Bieber and Denise Smith operated Tiny Tots group day care facility in Laurel, Montana. On the afternoon of January 31,2003, Bieber discovered that Dane Heggem had failed to awaken from his midday nap at Tiny Tots. Dane was airlifted to St. Vincent's Hospital in Billings, Montana, where he was pronounced dead. Dane\u2019s death certificate described the cause of death as diphenhydramine (generic Benadryl\u00ae), and indicated the death occurred by Dane being given a toxic dose of that liquid allergy and cold medicine. The autopsy report indicated the cause of death as \u201cmost likely an overdose of diphenhydramine.\u201d Investigators for the State of Montana learned that, during the previous year, Tiny Tots had purchased enough diphenhydramine to supply more than eleven doses of the medicine per day, and that no directions to Tiny Tots from the Heggems or parents of other children explained the use of the medicine in that amount.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-10\">\u00b66 On March 18,2003, Travis and Calista Heggem-Dane's father and mother-filed an action against Bieber and Tiny Tots which requested, in pertinent part, compensatory damages \u201cin all categories available under Montana law\u201d for Bieber\u2019s and Tiny Tots\u2019 negligent administration of Benadryl\u00ae which caused Dane\u2019s \u201clast illness, suffering, and death.\u201d Discovery ensued in that action. In the spring of 2003, Bieber responded to an interrogatory by identifying Capitol as her insurer and the policy\u2019s liability limit as $300,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-11\">\u00b67 In mid-July of 2003, the Heggems\u2019 attorney made a demand on Capitol for settlement of the $300,000 policy limit in the action against Bieber and Tiny Tots. Capitol responded that it would pay the demand. Within a week, the Heggems withdrew that demand and demanded $600,000. Capitol refused the demand.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>\u00b68 On July 25,2003, the Heggems filed a complaint asserting Unfair Trade Practices Act (UTPA) violations and misrepresentation against Bieber and Capitol. In quick succession, they filed a first amended complaint and a second amended complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-4\">\u00b69 The second amended complaint named Capitol as the only defendant. It alleged that the State had filed criminal charges against Bieber in July of2003 in connection with Dane\u2019s death and-along the same lines as its action against Bieber and Tiny Tots-that Bieber had given Dane the lethal dose of diphenhydramine which caused his death. The Heggems further alleged that, since Bieber\u2019s liability was reasonably clear by that time, Capitol\u2019s obligation was to honestly represent the insurance coverage available. They asserted that Capitol violated the UTPA, \u00a7\u00a7 33-18-101 through -1006, MCA, by misrepresenting the maximum amount of liability insurance available when it offered the Heggems $300,000 as the available policy limit in the action against Bieber and Tiny Tots. The Heggems alleged entitlement under their third-party rights to twice the policy limit under an Aggregate Limits provision in the Capitol policy for \u201call \u2018occurrences\u2019 \u201d during a policy period, referencing the claims very broadly alleged in the separate action against Bieber and Tiny Tots. In the latter regard, the Heggems alleged these claims \u201ctriggered the multiple aggregate claims provisions\u201d in Capitol\u2019s policy. Finally, the second amended complaint alleged a first-party claim, based upon a written assignment to them by Bieber of her first-party rights, claiming that Capitol breached its obligations to Bieber under the UTPA by failing to settle the underlying suit within the alleged $600,000 policy limit and failing to obtain a release for Bieber.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">\u00b610 Capitol answered the second amended complaint in September of 2003, denying the allegation it had violated the UTPA. It also moved to dismiss the third-party claims in this UTPA action pursuant to \u00a7 33-18-242(6)(b), MCA, which provides that a third-party claimant may not file an action until after the underlying claim has been settled or judgment entered for the claimant. The Heggems promptly opposed the motion to dismiss, primarily on the basis that the question presented under their third-party claims is the same as that presented under their first-party claims, which may be filed prior to a settlement or judgment on the underlying claim. <em>See </em>\u00a7 33-18-242(6)(a), MCA. Briefing on Capitol\u2019s motion to dismiss was completed.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-6\">\u00b611 Capitol also moved for summary judgment on the entirety of the UTPA action on the basis that its maximum liability to the Heggems under the policy is $300,000. It argued that the policy language at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>issue was unambiguous and sought a determination as a matter of law that the term \u201coccurrence\u201d used in the policy limits its liability to $300,000. Capitol asserted that, even assuming the truth of the Heggems\u2019 allegation of entitlement to damages in the separate action against Bieber and Tiny Tots, it is liable for only one \u201coccurrence\u2019-Dane\u2019s death-as defined in the insurance policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-4\">\u00b612 On the same day it filed its motion for summary judgment, Capitol moved for a protective order with regard to answering discovery requests from the Heggems. It asked the District Court to stay factual discovery until the court had rendered a legal determination interpreting the liability policy at issue. The Heggems responded in opposition and moved for discovery pursuant to M. R. Civ. P. 56(f) for purposes of addressing the summary judgment motion. They stated the discovery sought related to \u201cthe pertinent facts behind [Capitol\u2019s] drafting, underwriting, sale, and use of its Aggregate Limits provision.\u201d The parties agreed to suspend further briefing on the motion for summary judgment pending a ruling on the discovery motion. The District Court later granted Capitol\u2019s motion for protective order, stayed further activities in this case (and in the earlier action against Bieber and Tiny Tots) and, in December of 2003, denied the Heggems\u2019 motion for discovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">\u00b613 In January of 2004, after the Heggems filed a negligence action against Smith, they filed their brief-and numerous exhibits-in opposition to summary judgment in the present action. Capitol replied.</p>\n<p id=\"AK6\">\u00b614 In March of2004, the District Court granted summary judgment to Capitol, concluding the Heggems\u2019 claims were based on a single occurrence during a single policy period, and determining Capitol's liability to the Heggems cannot exceed $300,000. Then, without ruling on Capitol\u2019s motion to dismiss, the court entered judgment in favor of Capitol on the policy interpretation, and Capitol filed notice of entry of judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-6\">\u00b615 The District Court having failed to rule directly on Capitol's motion to dismiss the Heggems\u2019 third-party claims, the Heggems moved for certification of the judgment as final for purposes of appeal pursuant to M. R. Civ. P. 54(b). They later withdrew that motion, however, upon the parties' agreement that certification was \u201cneither necessary nor appropriate\u201d and the judgment was ripe for appeal. The District Court entered an order agreeing with the parties, stating, \u201cthe Court\u2019s Judgment entered March 26,2004 is stipulated by the parties (and the Court agrees) as final and dispositive of all issues in the [UTPA] action.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b458-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>\u00b616 The Heggems appeal from the judgment entered by the District Court on its order granting summary judgment to Capitol. They raise the two issues set forth above and resolved below.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-4\">STANDARDS OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">\u00b617 We review a district court's discovery rulings for abuse of discretion. <em>Spooner Constr. &amp; Tree Service, Inc. v. Maner, </em>2000 MT 161, \u00b6 24, 300 Mont. 268, \u00b6 24, 3 P.3d 641, \u00b6 24 (citation omitted). Under M. R. Civ. P. 56(c), summary judgment is proper when no genuine issues of material fact exist and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Overall, we review a summary judgment decision <em>de novo. Wages v. First Nat. Ins. Co. of America, </em>2003 MT 309, \u00b6 9, 318 Mont. 232, \u00b6 9, 79 P.3d 1095, \u00b6 9 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b458-6\">ISSUE 1</p>\n<p id=\"b458-7\">\u00b618 Diet the District Court abuse its discretion in denying the Heggems\u2019 motion to conduct discovery on issues relating to interpretation of the insurance policy?</p>\n<p id=\"b458-8\">\u00b619 In responding to Capitol\u2019s motion for summary judgment, the Heggems also moved for discovery under M. R. Civ. P. 56(f), seeking factual information relating to Capitol\u2019s interpretation of the Aggregate Limits provision of its insurance policies in other cases. The District Court denied the motion, determining the Heggems had not met the requirements of M. R. Civ. P. 56(f) and, since Capitol\u2019s motion for summary judgment sought a legal interpretation that the policy was clear and not ambiguous, the discovery requested would be irrelevant at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-9\">\u00b620  M. R. Civ. P. 56(f) provides that, if it appears from affidavits filed by a party opposing a summary judgment motion that the party cannot timely present facts necessary to justify its opposition to the motion, a district court may deny the motion for summary judgment or continue the proceedings. Here, the Heggems did not file the affidavit required by M. R. Civ. P. 56(f) in conjunction with their Rule 56(f) motion. Therefore, we conclude the District Court did not abuse its discretion in denying the Heggems\u2019 M. R. Civ. P. 56(f) motion for failure to meet the requirements of the rule. Consequently, we need not address the District Court\u2019s second rationale for denying the Heggems\u2019 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>ISSUE 2</p>\n<p id=\"b459-4\">\u00b621 Did the District Court err in determining that the policy\u2019s provisions relating to the coverage available were unambiguous as a matter of law and the available policy limit was $300,000 as represented by the insurer, and in granting the insurer\u2019s motion for summary judgment on those bases?</p>\n<p id=\"b459-5\">\u00b622  The language of a contract governs its interpretation if that language is clear and explicit. Section 28-3-401, MCA. Interpretation of an insurance contract is a question of law. <em>Augustine v. Simonson, </em>283 Mont. 259, 263, 940 P.2d 116, 118 (1997) (citation omitted). Courts must look at an insurance contract as a whole and attempt to reconcile the various parts to give each meaning and effect. <em>Farmers Alliance Mut. Ins. Co. v. Holeman, </em>1998 MT 155, \u00b6 25, 289 Mont. 312, \u00b6 25, 961 P.2d 114, \u00b6 25 (citation omitted). An ambiguity exists when an insurance contract, taken as a whole, is reasonably subject to two or more different interpretations. <em>Holeman, </em>\u00b6 25 (citation omitted). However, a court may not create an ambiguity where none exists, nor may a court rewrite an insurance policy by ignoring clear and unambiguous language to accomplish a \u201cgood purpose.\u201d <em>See Stillwater Condominium Ass\u2019n v. American Home Assur. Co., </em>508 F. Supp. 1075, 1080 (D. Mont. 1981), <em>aff'd </em>688 F.2d 848 (9th Cir. 1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b459-6\">\u00b623 Capitol\u2019s motion for summary judgment sought an interpretation, as a matter of law, that it did not misrepresent its express and unambiguous policy language, which set the liability limit for any one occurrence at $300,000. Capitol\u2019s motion and brief-interpreting the \u201cone occurrence\u201d provision in the policy-were based on the allegations set forth in the Heggems\u2019 earlier action against Bieber and Tiny Tots and their second amended UTPA complaint: primarily, that Bieber gave Dane the lethal dose of diphenhydramine which caused his death, and that-pursuant to the \u201call occurrences\u201d policy language-the various claims in their separate action against Bieber and Tiny Tots \u201ctriggered the multiple, aggregate claims provision\u201d in Capitol\u2019s policy. The Heggems\u2019 response brief and exhibits, submitted after they filed a separate action against Smith, relied to a large extent on a theory that the aggregate limits of the policy applied because multiple persons have multiple claims caused by two tortfeasors, Bieber and Smith. In other words, they relied on a \u201cmultiple occurrences\u201d theory. The Heggems argued summary judgment was improper because there had been more than one \u201coccurrence\u201d in this case, thereby invoking the $600,000 Aggregate Limits provision of the policy. Capitol replied, pointing out-among other things-this shift away from the allegations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>in the UTPA second amended complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-4\">\u00b624 The policy at issue states Capitol will pay sums the insured becomes legally obligated to pay as damages because of bodily injury. \u201cBodily injury\u201d is defined as \u201cbodily injury, sickness or disease sustained by a person, including death resulting from any of these at any time.\u201d The \u201cLimits of Insurance\u201d provision states \u201c[t]he most we will pay for loss or damage in any one occurrence is the applicable [$300,000] Limit of Insurance shown in the Declarations,\u201d regardless of the number of insureds, claims made, suits brought or persons or organizations making claims or bringing suits. \u201cOccurrence\u201d is defined as \u201can accident, including continuous or repeated exposure to substantially the same general harmful conditions.\u201d The policy\u2019s aggregate limit, which is twice the $300,000 limit, is triggered only when there is more than one \u201coccurrence\u201d during a policy period.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">\u00b625 The District Court concluded the Capitol policy language was clear and unambiguous and the Aggregate Limits provision of the policy was not invoked under the circumstances presented here. It determined the number of occurrences is determined by the number of causes, not the number of effects, rejecting the Heggems\u2019 contention that each person who brought a claim of injury as a result of Dane\u2019s death represents a separate \u201coccurrence\u201d under the Capitol policy. The court also rejected the Heggems\u2019 claim that alleged prior administrations of diphenhydramine to Dane were additional \u201coccurrences\u201d under the insurance policy. The court determined as a matter of law that the applicable policy limit was $300,000 and that Capitol had not violated the UTPA by misrepresenting that limit. It granted summary judgment to Capitol.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-6\">\u00b626 The District Court relied primarily on the policy language and analysis in <em>Greaves v. State Farm Ins. Co., </em>984 F. Supp. 12 (D.D.C. 1997), <em>aff'd, </em>172 F.3d 919 (C.A.D.C. 1998), in reaching its conclusion that Capitol is liable to the Heggems for one \u201coccurrence.\u201d <em>Greaves </em>was a declaratory judgment action brought against a landlord\u2019s insurer by the plaintiffs in an underlying negligence suit against the landlord for injuries and a death related to an apartment building fire. On cross-motions for summary judgment in the declaratory action, both parties asserted the policy language was clear, and the plaintiffs suggested alternatively that their interpretation \u201cevinces... a profound ambiguity in the policy\u2019s coverage limitations.\u201d <em>Greaves, </em>984 F. Supp. at 14. The plaintiffs argued the applicable policy limit of the owner\u2019s liability insurance was $2 million under an aggregate provision \u201cfor all occurrences during the policy\u2019s coverage period.\u201d <em>Greaves, </em>984 F. Supp. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>at 14. They contended each person who suffered a bodily injury represented a separate occurrence under the policy. <em>Greaves, </em>984 F. Supp. at 15. The insurer argued there was only one occurrence, with an available policy limit of $1 million. <em>Greaves, </em>984 F. Supp. at 14.</p>\n<p id=\"Akm\">\u00b627 Observing that disagreement over the meaning of an insurance provision does not render the policy ambiguous, the federal district court determined one fire caused the injuries and, thus, there was only one occurrence. Further noting that the vast majority of jurisdictions construe the term \u201coccurrence\u201d as used in insurance policies to refer to the cause or causes of the injury rather than the number of injuries, the court also rejected the plaintiffs\u2019 argument that each negligent act or omission which led to the fire constituted a separate occurrence. <em>Greaves, </em>984 F. Supp. at 17 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b461-4\">\u00b628 The District Court also relied on <em>Scottsdale Ins. Co. v. Robertson, 788 </em>N.E.2d 279 (App. Ct. Ill. 2003). There, several tenants injured by carbon monoxide poisoning in an apartment building had brought a negligence suit against the building owners. In <em>Scottsdale, </em>the building owners\u2019 insurer sought a declaratory judgment that it was liable for only one \u201coccurrence.\u201d The Illinois court observed the well-settled law that the number of occurrences is determined by the number of causes and not the number of effects, and affirmed a trial court ruling that the insurance policy unambiguously established a limit per occurrence which applied regardless of the number of people who sustained injuries. <em>Scottsdale Ins., 788 </em>N.E.2d at 282.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">\u00b629 On appeal in the present case, the Heggems contend the Capitol policy does not adequately describe what constitutes an \u201coccurrence,\u201d creating an ambiguity in which the language used is reasonably subject to two or more different interpretations. Capitol responds that this argument is raised for the first time on appeal and, for that reason, we should not address it. Capitol is correct that we do not address issues raised or new theories presented on appeal. <em>See, e.g., City of Billings v. Peterson, </em>2004 MT 232, \u00b6 21, 322 Mont. 444, \u00b6 21, 97 P.3d 532, \u00b6 21 (citation omitted). Here, however, we will discuss the Heggems\u2019 contention because it is sufficiently intertwined with arguments considered by the District Court in its determination that Capitol\u2019s policy is clear and unambiguous as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-6\">\u00b630 The Heggems properly rely on <em>Leibrand v. National Farmers Union Property and Cas. Co., </em>272 Mont. 1, 6, 898 P.2d 1220, 1223 (1995) (citation omitted), for the proposition that, when an ambiguity exists, Montana courts construe an insurance policy provision against the insurer. However, a mere disagreement over the meaning of an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>insurance provision does not render the provision ambiguous. <em>See Greaves, </em>984 F. Supp. at 17. Here, we conclude that none of the Heggems\u2019 proposed interpretations of \u201coccurrence\u201d under the Capitol policy are reasonable; nor are they supported by the case law upon which the Heggems rely.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-4\">\u00b631 In interpreting the term \u201coccurrence\u201d as used in liability policies which limit the insurer\u2019s liability to a specified amount per \u201coccurrence,\u201d the vast majority of courts view it from the perspective of causation-referring to the cause or causes of the damage or injury-and not the number of injuries or claims. <em>CSX Transp., Inc. et al. v. Continental Ins. Co., </em>680 A.2d 1082, 1091 (Md. 1996) (citations omitted). <em>See also Michigan Chemical Corp. v. Am. Home Assur. Co., </em>728 F.2d 374, 379 (6th Cir. 1984); Michael P. Sullivan, <em>What Constitutes Single Accident or Occurrence Within Liability Policy Limiting Insurer\u2019s Liability to a Specified Amount Per Accident or Occurrence, </em>64 A.L.R. 4th 668 (2005). We adopt this \u201ccause\u201d theory for interpreting the term \u201coccurrence\u201d in an insurance liability policy that limits the insurer\u2019s liability to a specified amount per \u201coccurrence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">\u00b632 Under the Heggems\u2019 first proposed interpretation, they are eligible for coverage under the Capitol policy for four different \u201coccurrences.\u201d As argued, those occurrences are Bieber's administration of a toxic dose of diphenhydramine to Dane; Smith\u2019s negligent failure to prevent Bieber\u2019s act; the family\u2019s learning of the facts concerning Dane's death (which they contend caused them emotional damage); and their learning of the facts concerning Smith\u2019s failure to prevent Bieber\u2019s act (which they contend also caused them emotional damages).</p>\n<p id=\"b462-6\">\u00b633 The Heggems rely on <em>Arizona Property and Cas. Ins. Guar. Fund v. Helme, </em>735 P.2d 451 (Ariz. 1987), in support of this interpretation. <em>Helme </em>arose from an underlying action in which an accident victim\u2019s survivors claimed two physicians had negligently failed to look at x-rays of the victim\u2019s spine in connection with consultation and surgery following the accident. During the litigation, each doctor stipulated to his own negligence in failing to either review the x-rays or to recognize the problem revealed by those x-rays. <em>Helme, </em>735 P.2d at 455. The doctors\u2019 insurer then brought <em>Helme, </em>a declaratory judgment action, to limit its obligation to pay claims to the policy limit for one \u201coccurrence.\u201d The Supreme Court of Arizona determined that, because the first doctor did nothing to cause the second doctor to fail to examine the x-rays, the two failures constituted separate, unrelated causal acts which resulted in the injury and, consequently, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>complaint alleged two separate occurrences. As a result, the survivors could recover for claims against both doctors under the liability policy. Helme, 735 P.2d at 458.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-4\">\u00b634 Here, the policy definition of an \u201coccurrence\u201d is somewhat similar to the policy language in <em>Helme </em>in that it encompasses an \u201caccident\u201d caused by \u201ccontinuous or repeated exposure to substantially the same general harmful conditions.\u201d However, unlike in <em>Helme, </em>no facts of record in the underlying case against Bieber and Tiny Tots are before us. Moreover, both the earlier action and the UTPA second amended complaint at issue here allege only one cause: Bieber\u2019s lethal dose of diphenhydramine. That is the only cause alleged at the times Bieber and Capitol represented the available policy limit as $300,000. The allegation that Smith failed to stop Bieber\u2019s administration of the medicine-assuming the Heggems could establish she had an opportunity or authority to stop it-had not been made at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"Arn\">\u00b635 The other two \u201coccurrences\u201d claimed by the Heggems under this interpretation are the family\u2019s learning of the cause of Dane\u2019s death and their learning of Smith\u2019s failure to prevent it. However, neither the family\u2019s learning of the cause of death nor the \u2018learning of Smith\u2019s failure\u201d to prevent the death had been alleged as an occurrence at the times the policy limit was represented as $300,000. In any event, both of these two alleged occurrences focus on results, not acts or omissions, and cannot reasonably be termed \u201ccausal acts.\u201d As aresult, <em>Helme </em>does not support interpreting these \u201cresults\u201d as separate \u201coccurrences\u201d under the Capitol policy at issue here.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">\u00b636 Under the Heggems\u2019 second proposed interpretation, each alleged dose of diphenhydramine given to Dane at Tiny Tots and each alleged failure of Smith to warn the Heggems that Dane was being medicated constituted an \u201coccurrence.\u201d Under this interpretation, the Heggems contend Capitol is liable for the aggregate limits of the policy for two separate years, because they claim some doses were given to Dane in the policy year prior to the one in which he died. They rely on <em>New Hampshire Ins. Co. v. RLI Ins. Co., 807 </em>So.2d 171 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 2002), and <em>American Indem. Co. v. McQuaig, </em>435 So.2d 414 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 1983), but neither case supports the Heggems\u2019 second proposed interpretation or their contention that the term \u201coccurrence\u201d is ambiguous in the Capitol policy. Before discussing the cases, it is important to again observe that neither of the allegations raised in this second proposed interpretation had been asserted at the times the policy limit representations were made in the spring and summer of 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>\u00b637 In <em>New Hampshire Ins., </em>the Florida District Court of Appeal-applying the \u201ccause\u201d theory-held that three gunshots fired by a condominium resident, each of which injured a different person, constituted three occurrences under the condominium association's insurance policy. <em>New Hampshire Ins., </em>807 So.2d at 172. Similarly, in <em>McQuaig, </em>the court determined that each of three shotgun blasts fired at deputy sheriffs by a mentally ill homeowner was a separate occurrence under the homeowner's insurance policy, resulting in insurer liability for three separate \u201coccurrences.\u201d The court determined each act caused bodily injury independent of any other act. <em>McQuaig, </em>435 So.2d at 416.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-4\">\u00b638 Here, based on the record before us and the time frame during which the available policy limit was represented, the insured\u2019s liability was premised on Dane\u2019s death from the overdose of diphenhydramine, the \u201cbodily injury\u201d as defined in Capitol's policy. No bodily injury to Dane was alleged regarding prior doses of the medication at that time. Unlike in <em>New Hampshire Ins. </em>or <em>McQuaig, </em>liability was incurred and the bodily injury to Dane arose from one alleged act-the overdose which caused Dane\u2019s death. As a result, neither <em>New Hampshire Ins. </em>nor <em>McQuaig, </em>which both rest on the \u201ccause\u201d interpretation we adopted above, supports the Heggems\u2019 theory as to multiple \u201coccurrences.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AAU\">\u00b639 Under the Heggems\u2019 third proposed interpretation, there were four occurrences: the loss of Dane\u2019s life, and the resulting emotional distress to the three surviving family members. They rely on <em>U.E. Texas One-Barrington, Ltd. v. General Star Indem. Co., </em>332 F.3d 274 (5th Cir. 2003), in support of an \u201ceffects\u201d interpretation of \u201coccurrence.\u201d <em>U.E. Texas, </em>however, focused on cause, not effects.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">\u00b640 In <em>U.E. Texas, </em>the owner of 19 apartment buildings sought recovery from its insurer for water damages to the buildings from leaking pipes. The Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed a federal district court ruling that the water damage constituted 19 separate \u201coccurrences;\u201d as a result, the owner was required to pay 19 insurance deductibles. The Fifth Circuit Court deemed it significant that, although the pipes were all installed as part of a single plumbing system, different leaks were responsible for damage to each building. <em>U.E. Texas, </em>332 F.3d at 278. The court stated that, under Texas law, the proper focus in interpreting \u201coccurrence\u201d is on the events that cause the injury and give rise to the insured's liability, rather than on the number of injurious effects. <em>U.E. Texas, </em>332 F.3d at 277. The court then stated, \u201ctjhe parties have stipulated that a different leak was responsible for the damage to each building, and as such we agree with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>the district court that each leak constitutes a separate occurrence as a matter of law.\u201d <em>U.E. Texas, </em>332 F.3d at 278. The separate leaks were the causes of damages or injury; they were not the damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-4\">\u00b641 Here, in contrast to the 19 leaky pipes in <em>U.E. Texas, </em>the only alleged cause of Dane\u2019s death raised at the time of the policy limit representations was Bieber\u2019s lethal dose of diphenhydramine. <em>U.E. Texas, </em>a \u201ccause\u201d interpretation case, does not support the Heggems\u2019 third theory.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">\u00b642  Contract terms are not ambiguous just because the parties disagree over their proper interpretation. <em>Michigan Chemical Corp., </em>728 F.2d at 378; <em>Greaves, </em>984 F. Supp. at 15. Because none of the Heggems\u2019 proposed interpretations of \u201coccurrence\u201d is reasonable in the somewhat unique context of this case, the Heggems have not shown that \u201coccurrence,\u201d as defined in the Capitol policy, is reasonably subject to two or more different interpretations. As a result, we conclude the Heggems have not established that the term \u201coccurrence\u201d as used in the Capitol policy is ambiguous. <em>See Holeman, </em>\u00b6 25.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-6\">\u00b643 Finally, the Heggems contend the law on negligent infliction of emotional distress allows separate claims for each of them, citing <em>Treichel v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., </em>280 Mont. 443, 930 P.2d 661 (1997), and <em>Sacco v. High Country Independent Press, Inc., </em>271 Mont. 209, 896 P.2d 411 (1995). In those cases, we recognized an independent cause of action for negligent infliction of emotional distress. <em>See Treichel, </em>280 Mont. at 448, 930 P.2d at 665; <em>Sacco, </em>271 Mont. at 220, 896 P.2d at 417-18.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-7\">\u00b644 Here, the Heggems\u2019 claims concerning negligent infliction of emotional distress were not alleged separately in the action against Bieber and Tiny Tots and had not been raised at the time representations of available policy limits were made in the spring and summer of 2003. In any event, those asserted claims do not relate to the number of occurrences for which Capitol is liable under its policy because of the policy language limiting coverage \u201cregardless of the number of... claims made ... or persons making claims.\u201d Moreover, the emotional distress claims are effects, not causes.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-8\">\u00b645  No ambiguity exists unless the language is reasonably susceptible to more than one interpretation. <em>See Michigan Chemical Corp., </em>728 F.2d at 378. We conclude that none of the alternative interpretations advanced by the Heggems is reasonable in light of the clear language of the Capitol policy, the cases advanced by the Heggems in support of their alternative interpretations, or the cause interpretation of an \u201coccurrence\u201d provision utilized by the vast <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>majority of jurisdictions, which we have now adopted. Finally, and importantly, no ambiguity exists because at the time the representations of available policy hmits-specifically at issue in this UTPA action-were made, the only alleged cause of Dane\u2019s death was Bieber\u2019s lethal dose of diphenhydramine.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-4\">\u00b646 Before closing, it is appropriate to address the Special Concurrence. The Special Concurrence is correct with regard to the manner in which this UTPA action should have proceeded and been resolved in the District Court. The case did not proceed in that fashion, however, and it is not this Court\u2019s job to \u201cremake\u201d the case presented to the District Court. Nevertheless, the Special Concurrence provides valuable guidance to practitioners and district courts in future cases.</p>\n<p id=\"AQq\">\u00b647  In summary, we hold that the District Court did not err in determining that the policy provisions relating to the coverage available were unambiguous as a matter of law and that the available policy limit was $300,000 as represented by Capitol. Therefore, we further hold that the District Court did not err in granting summary judgment to Capitol.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">\u00b648 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b466-6\">JUSTICES LEAPHART, WARNER, MORRIS and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b466-7\">JUSTICE NELSON,</author>\n<p id=\"AoQ\">specially concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-8\">\u00b649 I agree with the Court that the District Court did not err in granting Capitol\u2019s motion for summary judgment, and I agree with much of the Court\u2019s analysis. However, I do not believe that the dispositive issue in this case and its proper resolution are made sufficiently clear in the Court\u2019s Opinion. Thus, I write separately to clarify that issue and why summary judgment was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-9\">\u00b650 The parties have expended a great deal of effort in the District Court and in this Court arguing about whether Dane\u2019s death, in fact, involved more than one \u201coccurrence\u201d and whether the limit of Capitol\u2019s liability arising out of Dane\u2019s death is, in fact, $300,000.00. As a result, this case has taken on the appearance of a declaratory judgment action concerning the amount for which Capitol is liable in the Heggems\u2019 separate actions against Bieber and Smith.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> However, the questions of whether Dane\u2019s death <em>actually </em>constitutes just one \u201coccurrence\u201d and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>whether Capitol <em>actually </em>is liable for more than $300,000.00 are completely irrelevant in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-4\">\u00b651 The Heggems brought this action under the Unfair Trade Practices Act (Title 33, Chapter 18, MCA; hereinafter, \u201cUTPA\u201d). Section 33-18-242(1), MCA, establishes a cause of action by an insured or a third-party claimant against an insurer for actual damages caused by the insurer\u2019s violation of subsection (1), (4), (5), (6), (9), or (13) of \u00a7 33-18-201, MCA. Although the Heggems did not reference a specific subsection of \u00a7 33-18-201 in any of the three versions of their complaint, it is apparent from their pleadings that they were proceeding under subsection (1), which prohibits an insurer from \u201cmisrepresenting] pertinent facts or insurance policy provisions relating to coverages at issue.\u201d Section 33-18-201(1), MCA. Indeed, they cite \u00a7 33-18-201(1) in their Response and Objection to Capitol Indemnity\u2019s Motion for Summary Judgment.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">\u00b652 As we recently explained in <em>Redies v. Attorneys Liability Protect. Soc., </em>2007 MT 9, 335 Mont. 233, 150 P.3d 930 (2007), a claim brought under the UTPA must be analyzed based on what the insurer knew at the time it allegedly violated the UTPA. <em>See Redies, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 29, 40; <em>see also Graf v. Continental Western Ins.

Thus, a proper resolution of Capitol\u2019s motion for summary judgment requires analysis of the following questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-6\">1. When did Capitol allegedly violate \u00a7 33-18-201(1)?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-7\">2.

Is Capitol entitled to summary judgment on the Heggems\u2019 UTPA misrepresentation <em>claim?</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b468-4\">If the answer to any of the first four of these questions implicates a genuine issue as to a material fact, then summary judgment was improper. M. R. Civ. P. 56(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">\u00b653 1. When did Capitol allegedly violate \u00a7 33-18-201(1)? Capitol allegedly misrepresented policy provisions during mid-2003, in the context of the Heggems\u2019 negligence action against Bieber and Tiny Tots, which was filed on or about March 18, 2003. In particular, the Heggems identified in their Second Amended Complaint (with corresponding documentation attached to the complaint) three occasions on which Capitol had allegedly misrepresented policy provisions. First, the Heggems referenced an April 22,2003 letter from Capitol\u2019s counsel to the Heggems\u2019 counsel, in which Capitol\u2019s counsel stated: \u201cPlease note that the business policy declarations indicate that $300,000.00 of limits exist for liability.\u201d Second, the Heggems\u2019 referenced Interrogatory No. 2 in their action against Bieber and Tiny Tots, which requested from Bieber and Tiny Tots \u201cthe limits of liability\u201d for any \u201cpolicy (policies) of insurance that you contend covered you on the dates described in the Complaint against the type of risk involved here.\u201d Bieber\u2019s April 30, 2003 response (which the Heggems alleged was made at the direction of Capitol) was that \u201cthe limits of liability\u2019 were \u201c$300,000.00.\u201d Third, the Heggems referenced a July 25,2003 telephone conversation between Capitol\u2019s counsel and the Heggems\u2019 counsel, which Capitol\u2019s counsel memorialized in a letter (dated that same day) as follows: \u201c[Capitol] [was] prepared to and have asked me, on behalf of Sabine Bieber, to tender to you the sum of $300,000.00 which they believe is the total policy limit available on this case for liability and med pay.\u201d (The Heggems initiated the instant UTPA action that same day, i.e., on July 25, 2003.)</p>\n<p id=\"b468-6\">\u00b654 2. What did Capitol know (related to the coverages at issue) during mid-2003? When it responded to Interrogatory No. 2, and at the time of the communications between counsel for the Heggems and counsel for Capitol, Capitol had been presented with the Heggems\u2019 negligence claims against Bieber and Tiny Tots. In their complaint, the Heggems had alleged as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-7\">1. To the defendant business, and owner, they trusted and entrusted, for day care, their beloved young son, Dane.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-8\">2. While in that care, in January, 2003, Dane, on those premises and under defendants\u2019 care, became unresponsive; was airlifted to St. Vincent Hospital, and then died, on January 31, 2003.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b469-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>3. The State of Montana, and Yellowstone County authorities, after autopsy and investigation, have determined and written on Dane\u2019s death certificate that his death was \u201chomicide.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b469-4\">4. The defendant business and owner, and each of them, had administered, negligently, and without the consent of Travis and Calista [Heggem], quantities of Benadryl to Dane, which Benadryl quantity caused his last illness, suffering, and death.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b469-5\">5. State of Montana authorities have determined and reported other children at Defendants\u2019 day care were also given quantities of Benadryl, without the consent or knowledge of those children\u2019s parents.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b469-6\">6. The negligent acts, as stated, of defendant day care and its owner, not only took Dane from Travis and Calista, as well as Dane\u2019s entire family structure, but the circumstances are of such character as to also require the imposition, upon defendants, and both of them, of substantial punitive damages, to punish, and more importantly, deter any such other tragic breaches of duties owed to Parents, and their children, when entrusted to day care.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b469-7\">The Heggems requested compensatory damages \u201cin all categories available under Montana law ... as a result of the circumstances surrounding the loss of their son, Dane\u201d; punitive damages; and \u201c[s]uch other relief as the Court deems just and proper.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b469-8\">\u00b655 3. What did Capitol represent during mid-2003 as the limits of liability under the coverages at issue? $300,000.00.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-9\">\u00b656 4. Did this constitute a misrepresentation of pertinent facts or insurance policy provisions relating to the coverages at issue? No; for the reasons which follow, the Heggems have not shown that there is a genuine issue of material fact with respect to this question.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-10\">\u00b657 The policy states that the most Capitol will pay for loss or damage in any one \u201coccurrence\u201d is the applicable Limit of Insurance shown in the Declarations: $300,000.00. The most Capitol will pay for injury or damage arising from all \u201coccurrences\u201d during the policy period is twice this limit (i.e., $600,000.00). Under the \u201ccause\u201d theory of interpreting the term \u201coccurrence\u201d in an insurance liability policy that limits the insurer\u2019s liability to a specified amount per \u201coccurrence,\u201d that term refers to the cause or causes of the damage or injury. <em>See </em>Opinion, \u00b6 31. At the time of the alleged misrepresentations, Capitol had been presented with only one cause of Dane\u2019s death: Bieber\u2019s act of negligently administering diphenhydramine (Benadryl) to Dane. Thus, under the coverages then at issue, the limits of liability were $300,000.00.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>\u00b658 The Heggems subsequently alleged that Smith\u2019s failure to act to protect Dane was a separate cause of Dane\u2019s death. <em>See, e.g., Northwestern Nat. Cas. Co. v. Phalen, </em>182 Mont. 448, 455, 597 P.2d 720, 724 (1979) (\u201c[T]he word \u2018occurrence\u2019 is in fact broader than the word \u2018accident\u2019 and is so intended by the insurer. In such case, the intent of the policy is to insure the acts <em>or omissions </em>of the insured.\u201d (emphasis added)). However, the UTPA action is based on Capitol\u2019s representations in mid-2003, <em>before </em>the Heggems alleged Smith as a separate cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-4\">\u00b659 In addition, the Heggems subsequently proffered a number of interpretations of \u201coccurrence\u201d in support of their position. These interpretations reflected several different theories of relief based on multiple alleged administrations of diphenhydramine by Bieber and multiple alleged failures of Smith to act to protect Dane, all over multiple policy periods. <em>See </em>Opinion, \u00b6\u00b6 23, 32, 36, 39, 43. However, the complaint against Bieber and Tiny Tots contains no alleged prior acts of negligence and corresponding injuries to Dane.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> And there is nothing in the record of the communications in mid-2003 leading up to the filing of this UTPA action to suggest that the Heggems presented Capitol with such claims. To the contrary, the record discloses that these claims were articulated <em>after </em>the UTPA action had been filed.</p>\n<p id=\"Agq\">\u00b660 The Heggems argued in their Response and Objection to Capitol Indemnity\u2019s Motion for Summary Judgment that Capitol had misrepresented pertinent policy provisions by \u201cmiserably fail[ing] to identify at all the aggregate limit set forth in the policy.\u201d Further, they accused Capitol and its counsel of \u201ccarefully isolating and exploiting the declarations page.\u201d They acknowledged that the statement of Capitol\u2019s counsel in the April 22,2003 letter-specifically, \u201c[pjlease note that the business policy <em>declarations </em>indicate that $300,000.00 of limits exist for liability\u201d (emphasis added)-was \u201ctechnically true,\u201d but they claimed that this statement \u201cconceals the critical aggregate policy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>provision and is therefore untrue at best.\u201d The Heggems\u2019 assertions overlook two critical facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-4\">\u00b661 First, the Heggems had full access to the insurance policy, which was provided to them with the letter from Capitol\u2019s counsel dated April 22,2003. There is no indication in the record that Capitol withheld or \u201cconcealed]\u201d pertinent provisions of the policy. Rather, the record and the allegations set forth in the Heggems\u2019 Second Amended Complaint reveal that the Heggems simply did not bother to \u201cscour[] the policy\u201d until July 21 or 22, 2003.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">\u00b662 Second, and more importantly, \u00a7 33-18-201(1) prohibits an insurer from misrepresenting \u201cpertinent\u201d insurance policy provisions \u201crelating to coverages <em>at issue\u201d </em>(emphasis added). It does not require the insurer to recite, in response to an interrogatory requesting \u201cthe limits of liability,\u201d every limit set forth in the policy; indeed, a statement that the Aggregate Limits amount is the limit of liability could be a misrepresentation if that coverage is not \u201cat issue.\u201d And while \u00a7 33-18-201(4) requires the insurer to conduct \u201ca reasonable investigation based upon all available information\u201d before refusing to pay a claim, \u00a7 33-18-201(1) does not require the insurer, when responding to the claimant\u2019s inquiry as to the limits of liability, to conceive of every possible theory of relief the claimant may have, but has not yet articulated, and base its response on coverages that <em>could </em>be, but are not presently, at issue. Rather, \u00a7 33-18-201(1) requires the insurer to be forthcoming, truthful, and accurate with respect to \u201cpertinent\u201d insurance policy provisions relating to coverages \u201cat issue.\u201d <em>Cf. Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>1016 (Bryan A. Garner ed., 7th ed., West 1999) (defining \u201cmisrepresentation\u201d as \u201ca false or misleading statement about something\u201d or \u201can assertion that does not accord with the facts\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"AB6\">\u00b663 In this regard, six months after Capitol made the alleged misrepresentations, the Heggems stated in their January 13, 2004 Response and Objection to Capitol Indemnity\u2019s Motion for Summary Judgment that \u201cthe Heggems have just begun to piece together what happened to Dane over many months at Tiny Tots. Those facts must drive application of insurance nolicv language.\u201d This latter statement is certainly trae. It would be unreasonable, then, to expect Capitol to base its answer to Interrogatory No. 2 on facts that were neither <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>presented to it nor implicated by the Heggems\u2019 allegations and claims against Bieber and Tiny Tots. To be sure, Capitol itself could have ascertained-indeed, it may have done so-that Smith\u2019s supposed failure to protect Dane was a separate cause of Dane\u2019s death. <em>See, e.g., Ariz. Prop. &amp; Cas. Ins. Guar. Fund v. Helme, </em>735 P.2d 451, 458 (Ariz. 1987). But \u00a7 33-18-201(1) does not require an insurer, when responding to a \u201climits of liability\u201d interrogatory in a negligence action, to formulate its response based on potential tortfeasors who are not named as defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-4\">\u00b664 5. Is Capitol entitled to summary judgment on the Heggems\u2019 UTPA misrepresentation claim? The only remaining question is whether summary judgment in favor of Capitol was proper. As just explained, during the period in which the alleged misrepresentations were made, Capitol\u2019s liability under the policy was premised on only one cause of Dane\u2019s death: Bieber\u2019s act of negligently administering diphenhydramine to Dane on January 31, 2003. Under the \u201ccause\u201d theory of interpreting the term \u201coccurrence,\u201d this one cause constitutes one \u201coccurrence.\u201d Therefore, Capitol\u2019s statements that the limits of liability were $300,000.00 under the coverages then at issue were not misrepresentations. Accordingly, because there is no genuine issue as to any material fact on the question of whether \u201c$300,000.00\u201d constitutes a misrepresentation of the policy provisions by Capitol, and because Capitol is entitled to judgment as a matter of law on the Heggems\u2019 UTPA misrepresentation claim, summary judgment for Capitol on that claim was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">\u00b665 In granting summary judgment to Capitol, the District Court concluded as follows: \u201cThis Court concludes that the Aggregate Limits provision of the policy is not invoked under the circumstances and Capitol Indemnity is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d In reaching this conclusion, the court reasoned that \u201c[caselaw] supports Capitol Indemnity\u2019s position that Dane\u2019s death was the result of a single cause constituting a single occurrence and that such occurrence gave rise to all damages regardless of the number of claims made or suits brought.\u201d Further, the court reasoned that \u201c[t]he Heggems have not shown that more than one occurrence has taken place under the circumstances for purposes of avoiding summary judgment.\u201d However, the questions of whether Dane\u2019s death <em>actually </em>was the result of a single cause, whether Capitol <em>actually </em>was liable for only one \u201coccurrence,\u201d and whether the Heggems\u2019 various claims against Bieber, Tiny Tots, and Smith <em>actually </em>trigger the Aggregate Limits provision <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>are completely irrelevant-and are not capable of being resolved-in this UTPA action.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-4\">\u00b666 For one thing, at the time the District Court entered its order on March 15, 2004, a verdict had not been handed down in either of the negligence actions arising out of Dane\u2019s death. Thus, the District Court could not state at this juncture that Bieber\u2019s administration of the diphenhydramine was, in fact, the \u201ccause\u201d of Dane\u2019s death. That is an element of the tort claim against Bieber, which had yet to be proven. Furthermore, there may have been another cause of Dane\u2019s death, as alleged in the Heggems\u2019 negligence action against Smith for her failure to act to protect Dane. The District Court\u2019s suggestion that Dime\u2019s death was the result of a \u201csingle\u201d cause, therefore, was inappropriate. Lastly, the Heggems did not need to show in this UTPA case that more than one \u201coccurrence\u201d had taken place under the circumstances of Dane\u2019s death. Rather, they needed to show that at the time of Capitol\u2019s alleged misrepresentations, they had presented Capitol with facts or allegations implicating more than one occurrence. They did not make this showing.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">\u00b667 Accordingly, to the extent the District Court purported to issue a ruling in favor of Capitol\u2019s position \u201cthat Dane\u2019s death was the result of a single cause constituting a single occurrence and that such occurrence gave rise to all damages regardless of the number of claims made or suits brought,\u201d the court erred. However, because summary judgment was proper in this case-because Capitol did not, during the communications at issue here, misrepresent the limits of liability under the coverages then at issue as $300,000.00-the District Court reached the correct result.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-6\">\u00b668 On this basis, I concur in this Court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<judges id=\"b473-7\">JUSTICE COTTER joins in the special concurrence of JUSTICE NELSON.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b466-10\"> In this regard, the Heggems asserted in their Second Amended Complaint that \u201cthis is not an action for a \u2018declaratory judgment\u2019 regarding policy language.\u201d Yet, on appeal, they \u201cask this Court for a determination that the Capitol policies at issue afford coverage for the Heggems\u2019 claims in the amount of $1,200,000.00, as a matter of law.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b467-10\"> The Heggems also asserted in their Second Amended Complaint that \u201c[t]he totality of the circumstances that [Capitol] has created in this case ... also violates the Montana Consumer Protection Act, \u00a7 30-14-101 et seq., MCA, and constitutes unlawful and deceptive practices under \u00a7 30-14-103, MCA.\u201d Section 30-14-133(1), MCA, establishes a private cause of action for violation of the Consumer Protection Act. However, in their Response and Objection to Capitol Indemnity\u2019s Motion for Summary Judgment, the Heggems characterized the instant action as one brought under the UTPA; and on appeal, they neither mention the Consumer Protection Act nor raise a challenge pertaining to their allegations under that Act. Thus, we need not address it.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b470-5\"> In their Second Amended Complaint in the instant action, the Heggems allege that their complaint against Bieber and Tiny Tots in the negligence action was \u201cplead in broad terms so as to fully invoke all available claims under Montana law.\u201d Yet, while plaintiffs are generally not subject to any technical pleading requirements and complaints must be construed broadly in the plaintiffs favor, <em>Zempel v. Liberty, </em>2006 MT 220, \u00b6\u00b6 16, 17, 333 Mont. 417, \u00b6\u00b6 16, 17, 143 P.3d 123, \u00b6\u00b6 16, 17, the Heggems\u2019 complaint against Bieber and Tiny Tots only references the administration of diphenhydramine on January 31,2003, which caused Dane\u2019s \u201clast illness, suffering, and death\u201d (emphasis added), and requests compensatory damages \u201cas a result of the circumstances surrounding <em>the loss </em>of their son, Dane\u201d (emphasis added). This cannot fairly be read to raise claims arising out of Bieber\u2019s actions (and Smith\u2019s omissions) in 2002.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b471-6\"> In a letter from the Heggems\u2019 counsel to Capitol\u2019s counsel, dated July 22, 2003, the Heggems\u2019 counsel states that he is \u201cmore than a bit taken aback at what we have discovered, during the past 24 hours\u2019-namely, \u201cthat the true policy coverage for this tragic incident, and life-scarring event, is $600,000\u201d (based on the Aggregate Limits provision).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
