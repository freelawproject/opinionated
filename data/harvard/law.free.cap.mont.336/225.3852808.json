The Plaintiff, W. Steve Seltzer (\u201cSeltzer\u201d), filed suit against Steve Morton (\u201cMorton\u201d), Dennis A. Gladwell (\u201cGladwell\u201d), and Gibson, Dunn &amp; Crutcher, L.L.P., (\u201cGDC\u201d) (collectively \u201cDefendants\u201d), claiming that they had committed the torts of malicious prosecution and abuse of process. In the first phase of trial, the jury found in favor of Seltzer and awarded $1.1 million in compensatory damages. At this time, the jury also determined that the Defendants should be subjected to a punitive sanction. In the second phase of trial, the jury assessed punitive damages in the amount of $100,000.00 against Morton, $150,000.00 against Gladwell, and $20 million against GDC. The District Court reviewed the punitive damages verdicts, pursuant to both Montana statutory law and federal caselaw, and issued an order reducing the sanction against GDC to $9.9 million.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-11\">\u00b62 Seltzer has filed an appeal, arguing that the District Court erred in reducing the punitive damages verdict. The Defendants have filed a cross-appeal, arguing that the court erred by not further reducing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>the punitive damages verdict. Additionally, the Defendants have presented numerous other cross-appeal issues that were raised during trial and in post-verdict motions. We will address these various cross-appeal issues before considering the propriety of the District Court\u2019s decision regarding punitive damages. Specifically, in this order, we consider:</p>\n<p id=\"b253-4\">\u00b63 (1) Did the District Court err in instructing the jury regarding Seltzer\u2019s two theories of liability?</p>\n<p id=\"b253-5\">\u00b64 (2) Are the Defendants entitled to judgment as a matter of law on Seltzer\u2019s abuse-of-process claim?</p>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">\u00b65 (3) Are the Defendants entitled to a new trial based on the District Court\u2019s evidentiary rulings?</p>\n<p id=\"b253-7\">\u00b66 (4) Are the Defendants entitled to a new trial or remittitur based on Seltzer\u2019s closing argument?</p>\n<p id=\"b253-8\">\u00b67 (5) Is the jury\u2019s award of compensatory damages supported by substantial credible evidence?</p>\n<p id=\"b253-9\">\u00b68 (6) Did the District Court err in not applying the current statutory cap on punitive damages?</p>\n<p id=\"b253-10\">\u00b69 (7) Did the District Court err in following Montana statutory law regarding evidence of a defendant\u2019s financial condition?</p>\n<p id=\"b253-11\">\u00b610 (8) Is GDC entitled to judgment as a matter of law on the punitive damages verdict?</p>\n<p id=\"b253-12\">\u00b611 (9) Did the District Court err in applying federal due process law to the jury\u2019s punitive damages award?</p>\n<p id=\"b253-13\">\u00b612 We affirm in all respects.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-14\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b253-15\">\u00b613 Seltzer is, among other things, a professional appraiser and authenticator of Western American artwork (\u2018Western art\u201d). In late 2000 or early 2001, at the request of an art auction house, he rendered his opinion as to the authenticity of a watercolor painting that Morton owned. Morton subsequently demanded that Seltzer recant his opinion. When he refused to do so, GDC filed a multi-count lawsuit against Seltzer. That lawsuit, which was eventually dismissed with prejudice, is the subject of this litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-16\">\u00b614 Morton\u2019s painting, which was at the center of the underlying suit against Seltzer, bears a signature indicating that it is the work of Charles M. Russell (\u201cRussell\u201d). However, Seltzer and a number of other art experts believe the painting is actually the work of Seltzer\u2019s grandfather, Olaf Carl Seltzer (\u201cO. C. Seltzer\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b253-17\">\u00b615 Russell and O. C. Seltzer were renowned Western artists who <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>were contemporaries and friends. They both lived and produced Western art in the area of Great Falls, Montana, beginning in the late 1890\u2019s.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> O. C. Seltzer was a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Russell and they both painted similar types of old west cowboy scenes common in Montana. However, they had distinctly different painting styles and color palettes. O. C. Seltzer\u2019s work generally manifested more distinct lines and detail and a more subtle use of color. In contrast, Russell\u2019s work generally manifested a more vivid use of color and less distinct, suggested, lines and detail. These differences are often most notable by comparison of the sage brush and the motion of the figures depicted. Although both Russell and O. C. Seltzer are recognized as fine Western artists, Russell\u2019s work is more widely known and significantly more valuable.</p>\n<p id=\"As7\">\u00b616 Morton\u2019s painting, which is known as \u201cLassoing a Longhorn,\u201d depicts action and figures similar to that of other works by both Russell and O. C. Seltzer. Specifically, it depicts two cowboys, mounted on horseback, roping a longhorn steer. This action takes place on open prairie land against the backdrop of a distant cattle herd and another cowboy approaching on horseback. The steer, bearing a brand in the middle of its left side, is positioned near the center of the painting. The two cowboys featured in the foreground are positioned to the left and right of the steer. The cowboy to the left has secured a rope around the steer\u2019s horns, while the cowboy to the right is in the process of throwing a large loop towards the steer\u2019s hind feet. The overall color scheme is generally subtle, while the lines and details therein are generally distinct. In its lower left corner, the painting bears a signature, a bison skull marking, and a date, all in heavy black ink, purporting that the painting is a 1913 work by Russell. The signature style is similar to that used by Russell in 1913. Additionally, a bison skull insignia resembling that in the painting is a hallmark accompaniment to Russell\u2019s signatures. The painting currently measures <em>I6V2 </em>by 22% inches.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-4\">\u00b617 There is no record or known information regarding the painting<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>s origin, ownership, or whereabouts from 1913 to 1939. In November of 1939, the Newhouse Galleries in New York, New York, sold the painting to Amon Carter of Fort Worth Texas. The Amon Carter Museum\u2019s records listed the dimensions of the painting in 1939 as 20% by 26% inches-approximately 4 inches wider and 4 inches longer than the current dimensions of the painting. These same dimensions were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>cited in a 1966 book, discussed below, which catalogued the Museum\u2019s collection of Russell works. There is no evidence that the Amon Carter Museum ever authenticated or obtained independent authentication of the painting as a work of Russell.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-4\">\u00b618 In February of 1972, the Amon Carter Museum sold the painting to the Kennedy Galleries of New York, New York. In March of 1972, the Kennedy Quarterly, a publication featuring Western art then owned by the Kennedy Galleries, featured a print of the painting and listed its dimensions as I6V2 by 22% inches-the same as the current dimensions. There is no evidence that the Kennedy Galleries ever authenticated or obtained independent authentication of the painting as a work of Russell.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-5\">\u00b619 Morton and his brother, Frank, purchased the painting from the Kennedy Galleries in May of1972 for $38,000.00. Other than obtaining verbal assurances from officials of the Kennedy Galleries, the Mortons neither requested nor obtained any proof or independent verification that the painting was an authentic Russell.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-6\">\u00b620 In 1998, Morton contacted Bob Drummond (\u201cDrummond\u201d), the Director of the Coeur d\u2019Alene Art Auction, inquiring about the possibility of selling the painting at the Auction\u2019s annual Western art auction. Drummond advised Morton that the Coeur d\u2019Alene Art Auction could sell the \u201cchoice C. M. Russell painting\u201d at a \u201cvery good price.\u201d In August of 2000, Drummond notified Morton that the painting would likely \u201cfetch a record price\u201d at auction. Later that month, at Morton\u2019s request, Drummond appraised the fair market value of the painting as $650,000.00. Drummond is an experienced art appraiser familiar with the works of Russell. However, his aforementioned statements to Morton and his appraisal were premised on the assumption that the painting was an authentic Russell. He had not authenticated or obtained independent authentication of the painting as a Russell.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-7\">\u00b621 In late 2000 or early 2001, Morton decided to proceed with the sale of the painting by way of auction. However, Drummond\u2019s partner in the Coeur d\u2019Alene Art Auction, Stuart Johnson, suspected that the painting was a work of O. C. Seltzer. Accordingly, Johnson recommended that Drummond consult with Seltzer before attempting to sell the painting as an authentic Russell.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-8\">\u00b622 Seltzer resides in Great Falls, Montana, which is the home of the C. M. Russell Art Museum. He is the world\u2019s foremost expert on the works of O. C. Seltzer, and to a lesser extent, an expert on the works of C. M. Russell. As noted above, Seltzer is a professional authenticator <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>and appraiser of Western artwork. Particularly, he has long been engaged, upon request, in the business of authenticating the works of O. C. Seltzer throughout the country. In addition, Seltzer is a highly accomplished artist, having received numerous honors and awards at the prestigious C. M. Russell Art Auction held annually in Great Falls. !</p>\n<p id=\"A5f\">\u00b623 When Seltzer was contacted by Drummond, he expressed his opinion that, given the style and technique of the painting, it was clearly and obviously not an authentic Russell. Seltzer had seen a photograph of the painting in a 1979 edition of Horizon Magazine and had immediately determined that it was a work of O. C. Seltzer. In Seltzer\u2019s opinion, the distinguishing characteristics of the painting, as shown in the photograph, were obvious to a knowledgeable eye and there was therefore no need to inspect the painting itself prior to rendering his opinion. Viewing the original painting at trial in the instant suit, Seltzer pointed out what he had seen clearly in the photograph-i.e., that the color features and finely detailed sagebrush, action figures, and other details, were characteristic of O. C. Seltzer\u2019s work and uncharacteristic of Russell\u2019s work around 1913. In conjunction with this testimony, Seltzer also presented four O. C. Seltzer works which contain a steer that is virtually identical to that portrayed in \u201cLassoing a Longhorn.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b256-4\">\u00b624 To gather further information regarding the painting\u2019s authenticity, Stuart Johnson recommended that Drummond also contact Ginger Renner, who is the premier expert on the works of Russell, and to a lesser extent, the works of O. C. Seltzer. Ms. Renner is the widow of Frederic Renner, who was previously considered the premier expert on Russell\u2019s artwork. She was significantly involved in her late husband\u2019s work and she has carried on that work in the field of Russell art and Western art in general. In accordance with her expertise, she is considered a reliable authenticator of C. M. Russell art.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">\u00b625 Throughout his life, Mr. Renner studied, documented, catalogued, and collected many Russell works and related information. Among other endeavors, he provided authentication services to Western art collectors, including the Montana Historical Society, and also provided forgery detection assistance to the Federal Bureau of Investigation. In 1956, Montana Magazine published an article by Mr. Renner, based on a speech he had given at a Western art forum in Chicago that year, which chronicled the thriving trade in forgeries of Russell\u2019s artwork. It states, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-6\">A dozen or more [forgeries of Russell\u2019s artwork] have been offered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>to the Historical Society of Montana.... [A]ll of Russell\u2019s admirers and collectors should know some of the information that is available about this dishonest business. It needs publicity if it is to be stamped out. In general there are five categories of \u201cfake\u201d Russells.... The third category includes paintings by other artists, with the original signature painted out and Russell\u2019s substituted. A few of these are fine paintings but the style of the artist is usually so foreign to Russell\u2019s that it is immediately evident what they are.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-4\">... A number of years ago, three oils, painted and signed by [O. C.] Seltzer, the fine Montana artist who still lives in Great Falls, were offered for sale in New York. A few months later, the same paintings were seen in other galleries; but by this time Seltzer\u2019s name had been painted out and Russell\u2019s substituted, undoubtedly without Seltzer\u2019s knowledge. One of these paintings was unsold for several years. Finally, a leading New York dealer made a comment about it that reveals a good deal of the philosophy about forgeries held by some individuals. He said, \u201cit\u2019s too bad the_Gallery is trying to sell that Seltzer painting as a Russell; but if they are going to do it, they ought to make it convincing and put the price up around $7,000. Trying to sell it for a measly $3,500 merely spoils the Russell business for the rest of us.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-7\">Another thing to look at is the Russell signature on the painting.... What many do not know is that Russell experimented with his signature, just as he did with the rest of his painting and that he used five distinct styles of signatures; each during a definite and known period of his career.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b257-8\">Frederic G. Renner, <em>Bad Pennies: A Study of Forgeries of Charles M. Russell Art, </em>Montana Magazine, Vol. 6, No. 2, Spring 1956.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-9\">\u00b626 In 1966, Mr. Renner published a book entitled <em>Charles M. Russell: Paintings, Drawings, and Sculpture in theAmon G. Carter Collection. </em>This book featured a print of \u201cLassoing a Longhorn\u201d and, as noted above, listed its dimensions as 20% by 2694 inches-approximately 4 inches wider and 4 inches longer than the current dimensions of the painting. As indicated by the title page, Mr. Renner published the book for the Amon Carter Museum as a catalogue of Russell works then in the museum\u2019s collection. At that time, he assumed that \u201cLassoing a Longhorn\u201d was an authentic Russell, and thus a print of the painting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>was included in the book. However, this publication was merely a catalogue of the Amon Carter collection and the text of the book did not assert that the painting was actually an authentic Russell.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-4\">\u00b627 As noted above, Ginger Renner is known in the art world as the premier expert on the works of Russell, and to a lesser extent, the works of O. C. Seltzer, and she is known as a reliable authenticator of C. M. Russell art. Thus, at Drummond\u2019s request in late 2000 or early 2001, she examined a transparency reproduction of the painting. She then rendered her opinion that it was plainly the work of O. C. Seltzer and that the signature had been altered in some manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">\u00b628 Given the expert opinions of Seltzer and Ginger Renner regarding \u201cLassoing a Longhorn,\u201d Drummond contacted Morton in January of 2001 and told him that the Coeur d\u2019Alene Art Auction would not attempt to sell the painting as an authentic Russell because it was apparently a work of O. C. Seltzer. Later that month, Morton called Seltzer to discuss the issue. Seltzer generally explained the bases of his opinion regarding the painting\u2019s authenticity. Shortly thereafter, Seltzer sent Morton a letter following up on their conversation. In this correspondence, Seltzer told Morton that other O. C. Seltzer paintings depict a steer very similar to the steer in \u201cLassoing a Longhorn.\u201d Seltzer further recommended that Morton examine \u201ca C. M. Russell book and compare a 1913 C.M.R. watercolor with the one you have,\u201d and stated \u201c[you will] be able to see the differences.\u201d In closing, Seltzer offered to \u201cbe of further help\u201d on request.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-6\">\u00b629 On January 30, 2001, Morton took the painting from his home in California to Ginger Renner\u2019s home in Arizona. Ms. Renner examined the painting and immediately told Morton that, given the palette and style, it was unquestionably the work of O. C. Seltzer. The next day, Morton sent Ms. Renner a handwritten letter expressing his thanks and his \u201cstate of shock\u201d upon learning her opinion of the painting\u2019s authenticity. In this letter, Morton also requested that she provide him a letter formally expressing her professional opinion in order to help him determine a course of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-7\">\u00b630 The Defendants did not disclose this letter during discovery proceedings in the underlying suit against Seltzer or in the instant suit. When Seltzer eventually moved for sanctions in the instant action to address this conduct, the District Court found that the letter was \u201cunquestionably within the scope\u201d of Seltzer\u2019s requests for production in the underlying suit, his requests for production in the instant suit, and the court\u2019s Order to Compel in the instant suit. The court also found that the letter \u201cunquestionably goes to the heart of the claims <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>and defenses at issue in this case\u201d and that the Defendants\u2019 failure to disclose it was \u201cthe second incidence in this action of a failure to produce a highly relevant document adverse to their defense.\u201d Further, the court found that the letter \u201cplainly indicates that Morton recognized [Renner\u2019s] opinion as credible.\u201d Finally, the court found that the failure to disclose \u201cimpaired Seltzer\u2019s ability to depose key witnesses ... [and] impaired his ability to meaningfully follow up and investigate.\u201d Consequently, the court adjudicated the following facts as a discovery sanction:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-4\">[Following his consultation with Ms. Renner,] Steve Morton at all times knew and believed that Ginger Renner was a recognized and credible expert on the works of both C. M. Russell and O. C. Seltzer. Steve Morton thereafter had no reason to believe that Ginger Renner\u2019s analysis or opinion was premature, flawed, or otherwise insufficient in anyway. Consequently, as of January 31, 2001, Steve Morton knew that Ginger Renner\u2019s opinion created a serious and credible question as to whether the subject painting was in fact an authentic work of C. M. Russell.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">The Defendants have not appealed the court\u2019s findings or the sanction imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-6\">\u00b631 In February of 2001, at a cost of $200.00 to Morton, Ginger Renner sent him a formal letter stating in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-7\">In my opinion [\u201cLassoing a Longhorn\u201d] is a painting by the Montana artist, Olaf C. Seltzer. In every aspect, the palette, the draftsmanship is typical of the work of Seltzer. In light of the years of my experience with the work of Charles M. Russell there is nothing about this watercolor that would lead me to believe it was the work of C. M. Russell.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b259-8\">As an attachment to this letter, Ms. Renner included a writing by her late husband from a series of accounts which he entitled \u201cExperiences of a Russell Collector.\u201d She stated that it \u201creveals some of the practices of some of the dealers handling Western American art in the New York art market in the 30\u2019s and 40\u2019s.\u201d Similar to the above-noted account in Frederic Renner\u2019s 1956 Montana Magazine article, this account described an incident early in his career where Clyde Newhouse of the Newhouse Galleries, the first known possessor of \u201cLassoing a Longhorn,\u201d admitted to Mr. Renner that the Newhouse Galleries was then knowingly trying to pass off and sell an O. C. Seltzer painting, with a forged Russell signature, as an authentic work of Russell.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-9\">\u00b632 Also in February of2001, upon Morton\u2019s request, the Amon Carter Museum sent him information regarding the provenance of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>painting.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> This information included: (1) the Amon Carter Museum\u2019s record listing the dimensions of the painting as 20% by 26% inches in 1939; and (2) the Kennedy Galleries\u2019 publication listing the dimensions of the painting as <em>I6V2 </em>by 22% inches in 1972.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-4\">\u00b633 In March of 2001, Morton\u2019s attorney, Joshua Rievman of New York, wrote a letter to the Kennedy Galleries stating, inter alia:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-5\">In the past month the Mortons have been shocked to learn that the painting is not a work by Russell. Rather, two recognized experts on Western Art have concluded that the painting is obviously a work by an artist named Olaf Seltzer and that this must have been clear to any reputable dealer in the 1970\u2019s. As a result, the Painting, which was projected to fetch approximately $700,000 at auction, is likely worth, at best, only a tenth of this amount.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-6\">The Mortons consider Kennedy Galleries\u2019 fraudulent (or, at the very least, negligent) misrepresentations to be an extremely serious matter and intend to hold Kennedy Galleries liable for the damages they have suffered.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b260-7\">During discovery proceedings in the underlying suit against Seltzer and the instant suit, the Defendants failed to disclose this letter. Seltzer moved for sanctions in this case and the District Court found that this letter was highly relevant and adverse to the defense. As a sanction for the Defendants\u2019 failure to disclose this letter, in addition to other discovery abuses that impeded Seltzer\u2019s ability to depose witnesses, the District Court ordered GDC to pay court reporting costs and reasonable attorney fees incurred by Seltzer in moving for discovery sanctions. The Defendants have not appealed the court\u2019s findings or the sanction imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-8\">\u00b634 Later in March of 2001, in a written response to this letter, the Kennedy Galleries, through its attorney, asserted its belief that the painting was an authentic Russell. It further asserted that the painting\u2019s \u201cprovenance\u201d was \u201cunassailable\u201d because it had been purchased from the Amon Carter Museum and because Frederic Renner\u2019s 1966 book had listed the painting in the catalogue of Russell works then owned by the Amon Carter Museum. However, the Kennedy Galleries provided no proof of authenticity, authentication <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>analysis, or refutation of the credentials or opinions of Ginger Renner and Seltzer. In response later that March, Morton\u2019s counsel sent another letter to the Kennedy Galleries noting that the painting\u2019s current dimensions were substantially different than those on record when it was owned by the Amon Carter Museum. The letter concluded: \u201cThis size discrepancy is another of the factors that has caused the Mortons to question the work\u2019s authenticity.\u201d There is no evidence either that the Kennedy Galleries explained the size discrepancy or that the Mortons ever resolved it.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-4\">\u00b635 Thereafter, despite having admitted his knowledge that the painting was not an authentic Russell, Morton twice attempted to sell the painting as an authentic Russell. First, in June of 2001, he requested that the Kennedy Galleries sell the painting on his behalf. Despite its previous assertions regarding the painting\u2019s authenticity, the Kennedy Galleries notified Morton that it would not attempt to sell \u201cLassoing a Longhorn\u201d as an authentic Russell. Second, in July of 2001, Morton consigned the painting to Christie\u2019s Auction House in Los Angeles, California, for sale. Christie\u2019s returned the painting to Morton and notified him in writing that \u201cthis is not a work we can offer for sale.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b261-5\">\u00b636 By correspondence in July of 2001, Morton\u2019s counsel notified Seltzer, Ginger Renner, and Bob Drummond that the Mortons had \u201cconducted a very thorough search for and analysis of relevant authorities\u201d regarding the painting. This letter described the provenance of the painting from 1939 to 2001 and also noted that Frederic Renner had included the painting in his 1966 catalogue of works then owned by the Amon Carter Museum. In conclusion, the letter summarily stated: \u201cIt is clear that the results of our investigation... conclusively establish the authenticity of the painting. With this issue now behind us, the Mortons are moving forward to sell the painting with a renewed confidence in its authenticity.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b261-6\">\u00b637 Although asserting this \u201crenewed confidence,\u201d the Mortons had discovered no new information indicating that the painting was an authentic Russell; no new information refuting the acknowledged expert opinions of Ginger Renner and Seltzer; and no new information explaining or resolving the acknowledged discrepancy with the painting\u2019s dimensions. Consequently, Seltzer sent a letter to the Mortons\u2019 attorney stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-7\">In regard to the \u201cRussell painting\u201d owned by Steve Morton, you have most definitely not established the authenticity. Your provenance only goes back to 1939, which leaves 13 years <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>unaccounted for (Russell died in 1926). At best you have established the possible existence of a forgery prior to 1939.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-4\">More importantly, the work must stand on its own merits. I saw a reproduction of this painting in a magazine 15 or 20 years ago and knew instantly that it was an O. C. Seltzer painting with a C. M. Russell signature. In a discussion with Fred Renner a short time later, he agreed with me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-5\">... I can assure you as the grandson of O. C. Seltzer and as a professional artist, my opinion is a highly qualified one. No two artists paint the same way even though doing similar subject matter. O. C. Seltzer\u2019s way of handling paint is slightly different than Russell\u2019s and it is obvious to someone like myself who has made a study of both their works.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-6\">I certainly have no ax to grind with Steve Morton and in fact am sympathetic to his situation. However, to represent and sell this painting as an authentic C. M. Russell work is the wrong decision and will perpetuate the problem. Sooner or later the new owner is going to come looking for his money back.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b262-7\">\u00b638 Thereafter, Morton secured new counsel-Dennis Gladwell of GDC. In September of 2001, Gladwell sent Seltzer a correspondence resembling a formal litigation interrogatory seeking responses to ten pointed questions regarding the basis of Seltzer\u2019s opinion of the painting. The GDC letterhead on which this correspondence was written indicated that GDC was a large international law firm with offices in Irvine, Los Angeles, Century City, San Francisco, and Palo Alto, California; Dallas, Texas; Denver, Colorado; New York, New York; Washington, D.C.; Paris, France; and London, England.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-8\">\u00b639 In response, Seltzer sent a letter referring Gladwell back to Seltzer\u2019s original letter in which he had stated his qualifications and his opinion. Seltzer also stated: \u2018You keep referring back to Fred Renner\u2019s book and his opinion, etc. He made a mistake and realized that he had some years later.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b262-9\">\u00b640 Thereafter, Morton submitted the painting to a paper conservator, Margot Healey of Los Angeles, California, for analysis. She found:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aqf\">Examination using ultraviolet radiation did not reveal any irregularities or inconsistencies in the media or the paper that would indicate alteration or repair .... Based on visual examination using both ultraviolet illumination and microscopic aids, there is no evidence to suggest any alteration whatsoever has occurred. Specifically, I observed nothing to suggest that a signature had been removed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b263-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>As Ms. Healey merely examined the painting to determine whether it had been physically altered, her analysis did not constitute an authentication of the painting as a Russell. Nevertheless, Gladwell then sent a letter to Seltzer, Ginger Renner, the Kennedy Galleries, and the Amon Carter Museum, stating that \u201cthe opinions of Ms. Renner and Mr. Seltzer were found to be unsubstantiated\u201d by the paper conservator\u2019s report.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-4\">\u00b641 Then, in April of 2002, Gladwell sent a demand letter to Ginger Renner and Seltzer, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-5\">1. Each of you will draft a letter to our specifications completely recanting and withdrawing any statement you have previously made regarding the authenticity of the painting currently owned by Mr. Morton.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-6\">2. In the letter, among other admissions you will make, you will admit that you did not perform a detailed examination of the painting and that your \u201copinion\u201d was merely conjecture on your part.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-7\">3. You will agree to compensate Mr. Morton for the difference between what the painting sells for today, after we have tried to remove the cloud from its provenance, and what it could have sold for two years ago prior to your defamatory remarks about its authenticity.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-8\">4. Independently, you will reimburse Mr. Morton for the time, expense, embarrassment, grief and anxiety he has expended in trying to recover from your actions. The price: an additional $50,000 beyond the loss in value of the painting.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-9\">Mr. Morton gave you every chance to withdraw your damaging comments over the better part of eight months during last year. Each of you elected to ignore his pleas or simply dismissed them. You will not have that luxury this time around. We expect immediate cooperation on the drafting of your \u201cwithdrawal of opinion\u201d or litigation will be filed without any further discussion. And, given the opportunity afforded you to rectify this wrong, and your refusal to do so, punitive damages will be requested.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b263-10\">Seltzer did not respond.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-11\">\u00b642 Thereafter, Gladwell sent an email to William Claster, a partner in GDC, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-12\">We may need to open a new matter to pursue this painting issue I discussed. Erin [Alexander] has agreed to help.... The nature of the action will be injunctive relief, defamation of title, declaratory relief.... You and I will be the partners. I plan to bill very little <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>time. But all billing will be through the firm as per normal protocol. We will probably put in less than 20-30 hours. You will recall that Steve [Morton] is President of the Bob Hope Desert Classic so I want to do it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b264-4\">Gladwell was acquainted with Morton through prior representation. At the time of this email, Gladwell was a retired former partner on \u201cof counsel\u201d status with GDC. Consequently, pursuant to GDC\u2019s internal policy, Gladwell was required to obtain the permission of a partner who would be formally assigned to and ultimately responsible to the firm for the case. Claster was a partner authorized to grant Gladwell permission to proceed with the matter. Erin Alexander, referenced in the aforementioned email, was an associate member of GDC. Claster ultimately authorized Gladwell to proceed with the proposed litigation on behalf of GDC.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">\u00b643 In May of 2002, Gladwell sent a letter to Seltzer and Ginger Renner again threatening litigation. Gladwell attached a proposed declaration for Seltzer and Ms. Renner to sign, which stated, inter alia:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-6\">3. Although I did not inspect the original, I offered the view that this painting may actually be a Seltzer and that the Russell signature could have been forged.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-7\">4. By this statement, which was made only casually in conversation, I did not intend to imply that the painting was a fake, a duplicate, a forgery or copy or a Seltzer with an altered signature. It was simply a statement of \u201cpossibility\u201d that could apply to any painting including a Russell.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-8\">5.1 am in no position either to authenticate the provenance of Mr. Morton\u2019s painting as an original Russell or to deny its provenance. That would require a careful examination of the painting, and perhaps other ink, paper and brush-stroke tests, none of which I performed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-9\">6. It is unfortunate that my statement has been misinterpreted. I declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the States of (Arizona or Montana) that the foregoing is true and correct and that I executed this Declaration on</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-10\">_, 2002, at_.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b264-11\">Again, Seltzer did not respond.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-12\">\u00b644 On July 16,2002, William Claster, Gladwell, and Erin Alexander, under the caption and authority of GDC, along with Montana attorney Oliver Goe of the law firm Browning, Kaleczyc, Berry &amp; Hoven, P.C., filed a Complaint against Seltzer, on behalf of Morton and his brother Frank, in the United Stated District Court for the Montana District, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>Great Falls Division. The Complaint asserted the following separately pled claims against Seltzer: (1) Defamation, by knowingly publishing false statements \u201cwith an intent to damage the Mortons\u201d and \u201cwith the intent to defame the painting and the Mortons\u2019 reputation for honesty and fair dealing\u201d; (2) Declaratory Relief, for judgment that the painting is an authentic Russell; (3) Injunctive Relief, for judgment enjoining him from publicly asserting that the painting is not an authentic Russell; (4) Intentional Interference With Business Relations and Prospective Economic Advantage, by falsely claiming that the painting was not an authentic Russell and making this claim \u201cwith the intent to damage the Mortons\u2019 ability to sell the painting and to damage the relationship between the Mortons and the Coeur d\u2019Alene Art Auction\u201d; (5) Negligence, by recklessly or carelessly \u201cchallenging the authenticity and provenance of the painting\u201d and by \u201crefusing to recant or withdraw his statements when presented with evidence that the signature on the painting was not forged\u201d; and (6) Punitive Damages, for engaging in the aforementioned conduct thus manifesting that he is \u201cguilty of actual fraud and/or actual malice,\u201d and because his statements \u201cwere made in bad faith\u201d and \u201chis actions were wanton, malicious, and designed specifically to harm and injure the Mortons.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AFT\">\u00b645 The Complaint requested relief in the form of declaratory relief, injunctive relief, general damages, special damages, punitive damages, costs, and attorney fees. As for compensatory damages sought, the Complaint alleged that Seltzer\u2019s stated opinion had caused the painting\u2019s value to be reduced \u201cfrom the range of $650,000.00 to $800,000.00\u201d down to \u201csomething under $50,000.00.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b265-4\">\u00b646 As noted above, GDC sued Seltzer on behalf of both Morton and his brother Frank. However, Frank Morton never authorized GDC to file suit on his behalf. He testified on this subject prior to trial in the instant case, and the parties stipulated that his testimony was true and required no proof. Consequently, the District Court recounted this undisputed testimony in the Final Pre-Trial Order, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-5\">Frank Morton, Steve Morton\u2019s brother ... has already testified in this case by way of deposition and his testimony is as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-6\">a. When the instant lawsuit [referring to the underlying suit against Seltzer] was filed, I was unaware that it had been filed or initiated but was told sometime later by my brother, Steve Morton, that it had been filed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-7\">b. I never authorized Gibson, Dunn &amp; Crutcher LLP (\u201cGDC\u201d) to file the instant lawsuit on my behalf and name me as a plaintiff.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-8\">c. I never met nor spoke with an attorney from GDC until two <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>days before my deposition in this lawsuit.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-4\">d. I never spoke with Dennis Gladwell or any other member of GDC before the instant lawsuit was filed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">Frank Morton\u2019s deposition referenced above was taken on January 29, 2004, roughly 18 months after GDC filed suit purportedly on his behalf.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-6\">\u00b647 Seltzer retained counsel and served formal discovery requests seeking disclosure and production of all non-privileged documents concerning the authenticity of the painting. The Defendants responded that they had produced all such information. However, they did not disclose two non-privileged letters-i.e., the correspondence from Morton to Ginger Renner and the correspondence that Morton\u2019s former counsel, Joshua Rievman, had sent to the Kennedy Galleries. As noted above, the latter correspondence contained key admissions, including: (1) \u201cthe Mortons have been shocked to learn that the painting is not a work by Russell. Rather, two recognized experts on Western Art have concluded that the painting is obviously a work by an artist named Olaf Seltzer\u201d; and (2) \u201cThe Mortons consider Kennedy Galleries\u2019 fraudulent (or, at the very least, negligent) misrepresentations to be an extremely serious matter and intend to hold Kennedy Galleries liable for the damages they have suffered.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b266-7\">\u00b648 Thereafter, Seltzer filed a Motion for Summary Judgment. In support of this Motion, he obtained and filed affidavits of 10 individuals (including himself and Ginger Renner) who had expertise regarding the works of Russell and O. C. Seltzer. Each of these affidavits expressed the opinion that the painting was not an authentic Russell. Shortly thereafter, the Mortons and their attorneys admitted, in a letter to the Kennedy Galleries, that they had not yet secured \u201ca first class expert on Russell who can testify confidently\u201d that the painting was is an authentic Russell. They also admitted that unless they could do so soon, \u201cthe law suit is probably over.\u201d Later that December, Gladwell acknowledged in an internal GDC email that \u201cthe Mortons may be ... unable to pursue the current litigation... since we have no trial expert and as yet, have been unable to establish a complete provenance ... and we are quickly running out of time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b266-8\">\u00b649 On January 8, 2003, Gladwell sent a demand letter to the Kennedy Galleries and the Amon Carter Museum, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-9\">[T]en declarations have been filed by Mr. Seltzer claiming that the painting is a forgery. Despite repeated requests, neither of [you] have produced an expert who can testify that the painting is a genuine C. M. Russell....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>Accordingly, demand is hereby made that you provide the Mortons with an authentic C. M. Russell whose value, at today\u2019s auction prices, would sell for $650,000. The Mortons will tender Lassoing a Longhorn to the Museum or the Galleries, as soon as a new Russell has been selected.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b267-4\">Nearly one month later, on February 6, the U.S. District Court dismissed the suit against Seltzer with prejudice pursuant to an unconditional stipulation of the parties necessitated by Morton\u2019s and Gladwell\u2019s acknowledged awareness that they could not prevail on the merits. In defending himself against this lawsuit, Seltzer incurred over $45,000.00 in legal fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-5\">\u00b650 Seltzer subsequently filed suit against the Mortons, Gladwell, GDC associate Erin Alexander, GDC, and Oliver Goe, alleging malicious prosecution and abuse of process. Frank Morton was dismissed, pursuant to a stipulation by the parties, following his deposition wherein he testified that he had never spoken with Gladwell before the suit against Seltzer was filed; that he had never spoken with any other GDC attorney before the suit against Seltzer was filed; and, most importantly, that he had never authorized GDC to file suit against Seltzer on his behalf. Additionally, the District Court granted summary judgment in favor of Erin Alexander and Oliver Goe and thus dismissed them from the suit.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In the first phase of trial, the jury found in favor of Seltzer on both his asserted causes of action, awarding $1.1 million in compensatory damages. In the second phase of trial, the jury awarded punitive damages in the amount of $100,000.00 against Morton, $150,000.00 against Gladwell, and $20 million against GDC.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b267-6\">\u00b651 The District Court issued an order reviewing the punitive damages verdicts pursuant to Montana statutory law, \u00a7 27-l-221(7)(c), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>MCA, and federal caselaw, <em>State Farm Mutual Auto. Ins. Co. v. Campbell, </em>538 U.S. 408, 123 S.Ct. 1513 (2003). This order, wherein the trial judge thoroughly and meticulously analyzed the factual and legal issues, contains numerous findings of fact which we refer to extensively hereinafter. In applying Montana law, the court determined that the punitive verdicts were not excessive. The court further determined that Montana\u2019s current statutory punitive damages cap, \u00a7 27-1-220(3), MCA, does not apply to this case. In applying federal due process jurisprudence, the court concluded that the punitive verdicts against Morton and Gladwell were not constitutionally excessive, but also concluded that the verdict against GDC did not comport with due process and therefore had to be reduced to $9.9 million. Seltzer then filed an appeal with this Court, after which the Defendants filed a cross-appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-4\">\u00b652 The Montana Trial Lawyers Association and the Montana Defense Trial Lawyers, Inc., have filed amicus curiae briefs addressing the punitive damages issues, for which we are appreciative. The parties presented oral arguments regarding the punitive damages issues in June of 2006, and we thereafter took this case under advisement. We now consider the nine issues previously referred to.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b268-6\">\u00b653 (1) Did the District Court err in instructing the jury regarding Seltzer\u2019s two theories of liability?</p>\n<p id=\"b268-7\">\u00b654 The Defendants challenge the jury instruction given by the District Court regarding Seltzer\u2019s abuse-of-process claim. However, the Defendants did not object to this instruction in the proceedings below. In fact, the Defendants\u2019 trial counsel explicitly stated, during the settling of instructions, that the Defendants had no objection to this particular instruction. We have held that failure to object to a jury instruction at trial constitutes a waiver of the opportunity to raise the objection on appeal. <em>Geiger v. Sherrodd, Inc., </em>262 Mont. 505, 508, 866 P.2d 1106, 1108 (1993). Accordingly, we do not address the Defendants\u2019 argument regarding the abuse-of-process instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-8\">\u00b655 Defendants also assert that the District Court erred in instructing the jury regarding Seltzer\u2019s malicious prosecution claim. It is well settled that \u201c[a] showing of prejudice is required to reverse a verdict because of an alleged improper instruction.\u201d <em>Stockman Bank of Montana v. Potts, </em>2006 MT 64, \u00b6 80, 331 Mont. 381, \u00b6 80, 132 P.3d 546, \u00b6 80; <em>Wilhelm v. City of Great Falls, </em>225 Mont. 251, 262, 732 P.2d 1315, 1322 (1987) (stating that a judgment will not be reversed based on an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>erroneous jury instruction unless the error prejudiced the complaining party). Here, although the Defendants make a substantive argument alleging instructional error, they present no explanation as to how they may have been prejudiced. Moreover, this Court is not obligated to develop such an argument on behalf of the Defendants. <em>In re Estate of Bayers, </em>1999 MT 154, \u00b6 19, 295 Mont. 89, \u00b6 19, 983 P.2d 339, \u00b6 19. Because the Defendants have failed in this regard, they cannot establish that any instructional error constitutes a basis upon which we should reverse the District Court. Accordingly, we do not address the Defendants\u2019 deficient argument regarding the malicious prosecution instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-4\">\u00b656 (2) Are the Defendants entitled to judgment as a matter of law on Seltzer\u2019s abuse-of-process claim?</p>\n<p id=\"b269-5\">\u00b657 In <em>Brault v. Smith, </em>209 Mont. 21, 28-29, 679 P.2d 236, 240 (1984), this Court held: \u201cEssential to proof of abuse of process is (1) an ulterior purpose and (2) a willful act in the use of the process not proper in the regular conduct of the proceeding.\u201d <em>Brault </em>also indicated that an abuse of process entails \u201can attempt by the plaintiff to use process to coerce the defendant to do some collateral thing which he could not be legally and regularly compelled to do.\u201d <em>Brault, </em>209 Mont. at 29, 679 P.2d at 240. Here, the Defendants moved the District Court for judgment as a matter of law on Seltzer\u2019s abuse-of-process claim. The court denied this motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-6\">\u00b658 On appeal, the Defendants present two arguments in seeking judgment on Seltzer\u2019s abuse-of-process claim. First, the Defendants contend that they are entitled to judgment because Seltzer \u201cbased his abuse-of-process claim <em>solely </em>on the filing of the complaint\u201d in the underlying suit, and the mere filing of an unfounded lawsuit cannot, as a matter of law, establish an abuse of process. (Emphasis supplied by Defendants.) We must reject the factual assertion contained in this argument because it is contrary to the record before us. The record clearly establishes that Seltzer did not base his abuse-of-process claim on the isolated fact that the Defendants filed a lawsuit against him. He based his claim on the Defendants\u2019 purpose in bringing the suit, as well as their conduct of utilizing the suit as an instrument of coercion, rather than a legitimate means to resolve a genuine dispute. Indeed, Seltzer\u2019s Complaint in this suit explicitly specified an alleged \u201culterior motive\u201d and Defendants\u2019 <em>use </em>of the lawsuit as the basis for the abuse-of-process claim-i.e., Seltzer alleged that the Defendants used the lawsuit \u201cto attempt to force Seltzer to untruthfully recant his opinion.\u201d This use of litigation, Seltzer further alleged, was \u201ca use <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>perverted beyond the legal and intended purpose of judicial process.\u201d Additionally, the District Court\u2019s Final Pre-Trial Order reiterated these allegations as the basis for Seltzer\u2019s abuse-of-process claim. This Order also identified more specific grounds for this particular claim-i.e., it stated that Seltzer contended the Defendants had no intention of taking the underlying case to trial and that they simply utilized the lawsuit as a means to force Seltzer to recant his opinion so as to enable them to sell the painting as an authentic Russell to an unsuspecting buyer.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-4\">\u00b659 Furthermore, Seltzer presented evidence and argument at trial demonstrating that it was the Defendants\u2019 ulterior purpose and their intentional <em>use </em>of the underlying lawsuit-not merely the filing of the Complaint-which formed the basis for his abuse-of-process claim. Among other things, Seltzer presented the letters he received from GDC prior to the instigation of the lawsuit, wherein the Defendants threatened to file suit and seek punitive damages if he did not recant, under oath, his professional opinion regarding the authenticity of the painting. Seltzer utilized this evidence to demonstrate that the Defendants\u2019 subsequent instigation of legal process was one element of an ongoing course of intimidating and coercive conduct; that the lawsuit was in fact intentionally employed as a coercive device; and that the Defendants\u2019 conduct was therefore an abuse of process.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">\u00b660 Seltzer also presented evidence and argument that the Defendants, while in the course of leveraging the underlying suit against him for nearly seven months, further abused legal process when they undermined the discovery proceedings by intentionally withholding pertinent documents, thereby impairing Seltzer\u2019s ability to defend himself. Specifically, Seltzer presented evidence that the Defendants deliberately withheld the Mortons\u2019 letter to the Kennedy Galleries wherein they acknowledged that the painting was not an authentic Russell, accusing the Kennedy Galleries of misrepresenting the authenticity of the painting and stating that \u201cthe Mortons have been shocked to learn that the painting is not a work by Russell.\u201d Additionally, Seltzer demonstrated that the Defendants withheld a letter Steve Morton sent to Ginger Renner wherein he similarly expressed his \u201cstate of shock\u201d over Ms. Renner\u2019s opinion that the painting was not an authentic work of Russell, and requested that she provide him a letter formally expressing her professional opinion in order to help him determine a course of action. Seltzer also used these documents to demonstrate that the Defendants had proceeded with an ulterior purpose. In short, the record directly refutes the Defendants\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>premise that Seltzer \u201cbased his abuse-of-process claim <em>solely </em>on the filing of the complaint\u201d in the underlying suit. Accordingly, we reject the Defendants\u2019 argument that they are entitled to judgment on Seltzer\u2019s abuse-of-process claim on this basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-4\">\u00b661 Second, the Defendants argue that they are entitled to judgment as a matter of law on Seltzer\u2019s abuse-of-process claim pursuant to this Court\u2019s statement in <em>Brault </em>that an abuse of process entails \u201can attempt by the plaintiff to use process to coerce the defendant to do some collateral thing which he could not be legally and regularly compelled to do.\u201d <em>Brault, </em>209 Mont. at 29, 679 P.2d at 240. Here, Defendants assert, Seltzer failed to present proof that they attempted to make him perform some \u201ccollateral\u201d act. Again, we find this assertion contrary to the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">\u00b662 Seltzer\u2019s testimony demonstrated that he genuinely believed the painting was not an authentic Russell and that his statements were specifically intended to convey that opinion. Seltzer also presented the Defendants\u2019 letters wherein they explicitly threatened to file suit against him if he did not profess, under oath, that his statements were \u201cnot intend[ed] to imply that the painting was a fake, a duplicate, a forgery or copy or a Seltzer with an altered signature.\u201d In short, Seltzer presented evidence that the Defendants invoked legal process in order to coerce him to lie about his professional opinion under oath. Yet, the stated purpose for which the Defendants invoked legal process was not to obtain this sworn declaration from Seltzer. Rather, the Defendants\u2019 Complaint, which Seltzer also presented as evidence in this case, professed to seek adjudication on the merits of the conflict so as to obtain an injunction, a declaratory judgment, and damages for loss allegedly caused by Seltzer\u2019s statements regarding the painting. Thus, the record demonstrates that Seltzer did in fact present proof that the Defendants used legal process \u201cto coerce [him] to do some collateral thing which he could not be legally and regularly compelled to do.\u201d <em>Brault, </em>209 Mont. at 29, 679 P.2d at 240.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Moreover, the District <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>Court, in reviewing the punitive damages award, found that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b272-4\">the manifest and acknowledged objective of the lawsuit was not to obtain an adjudication of the merits of the asserted claims, but rather to threaten Seltzer and force a negotiated retraction and disavowal of his opinion thereby enabling the Mortons to sell the painting at full market value as an authentic Russell.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AI4\">Accordingly, having found the Defendants\u2019 underlying assertion contrary to the record, we reject the argument that they are entitled to judgment as a matter of law on Seltzer\u2019s abuse-of-process claim.</p>\n<p id=\"AYk\">\u00b663 (3) Are the Defendants entitled to a new trial based on the District Court\u2019s evidentiary rulings?</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">\u00b664 The Defendants identify a number of evidentiary rulings which they contend were erroneous. Upon these contentions, Defendants seek a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">\u00b665 District courts are vested with broad discretion in controlling the admission of evidence at trial. <em>Lopez v. Josephson, </em>2001 MT 133, \u00b6 14, 305 Mont. 446, \u00b6 14, 30 P.3d 326, \u00b6 14. When reviewing a district court\u2019s evidentiary rulings we do not determine whether this Court would have made the same ruling. <em>Lopez, </em>\u00b6 14. Rather, we determine whether the district court abused its discretion. <em>Lopez, </em>\u00b6 14. In order to establish that the court abused its discretion, the appellant must demonstrate that \u201cthe district court acted arbitrarily without conscientious judgment or exceeded the bounds of reason.\u201d <em>Lopez, </em>\u00b6 14. Our analysis does not end, however, if an appellant demonstrates that a district court has abused its broad discretion in rendering an evidentiary ruling. <em>In re A.N., </em>2000 MT 35, \u00b6 55, 298 Mont. 237, \u00b6 55, 995 P.2d 427, \u00b6 55. We must then determine whether the demonstrated abuse of discretion constitutes a reversible error. <em>In re A.N., </em>\u00b6 55. As we have held, no reversible error occurs unless a substantial right of the appellant is effected, nor does reversible error occur unless the evidence in question was of such character as to have affected the outcome of the trial. <em>In re A.N., </em>\u00b6 55.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-7\">\u00b666 With these principles in mind, we address the District Court\u2019s contested evidentiary rulings regarding a deposition, several affidavits, expert testimony, and the cumulative impact of these rulings.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>Deposition</p>\n<p id=\"b273-4\">\u00b667 Following briefing by the parties, the District Court entered its Order to Compel and Protective Order which, among other things, set parameters for discovery in accordance with the attorney-client privilege and the work-product privilege. Then, after the court sanctioned the Defendants for withholding the letter sent to the Kennedy Galleries by Joshua Rievman on Morton\u2019s behalf, Seltzer attempted to depose Rievman. Following this deposition, Seltzer filed a motion <em>in limine </em>seeking an order prohibiting the Defendants from calling Rievman as a witness or reading his deposition at trial. In support of this request, Seltzer argued that the Defendants had improperly thwarted his questioning and violated the court\u2019s aforementioned Order during the deposition by objecting and instructing Rievman not to answer on the basis of attorney-client privilege thirty-three times.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">\u00b668 The District Court refused to bar the Defendants from calling Rievman to testify at trial. However, the court did prohibit the Defendants from presenting Rievman\u2019s deposition at trial. In reaching this decision, the District Court determined that the use of Rievman\u2019s deposition posed a \u201cpotential for confusion and misunderstanding of Rievman\u2019s testimony.\u201d The Court further reasoned that these potential problems created a \u201cheightened need for precise examination at trial,\u201d given the nature of the attorney-client privilege and \u201cthe heightened significance of the privilege in the context of the claims and facts at issue.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">\u00b669 M. R. Civ. P. 32(a) governs the use of depositions at trial. One subsection of that rule provides that a witness\u2019s deposition may be used at trial if the court finds that \u201cthe witness is at a greater distance than 100 miles from the place of trial or hearing, or is out of the United States, unless it appears that the absence of the witness was procured by the party offering the deposition.\u201d M. R. Civ. P. 32(a)(3)(B). The Defendants now argue that the District Court erred in prohibiting the use of Rievman\u2019s deposition because Rievman was more than 100 miles from the courthouse during trial and the defense did not procure his absence. In support of this argument the Defendants rely on <em>Rocky Mountain Enterprises v. Pierce Flooring, </em>286 Mont. 282, 292-93, 951 P.2d 1326, 1332-33 (1997), wherein this Court held, pursuant to M. R. Civ. P. 32(a)(3)(B), that the district court erred in prohibiting the use of a party\u2019s deposition where that party was living in California and there was no evidence the party\u2019s absence was procured by the litigant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>offering the deposition.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The Defendants present the holding of <em>Rocky Mountain Enterprises </em>as a categorical rule by which the District Court in the instant action was required to admit Rievman\u2019s deposition at trial. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-4\">\u00b670 First, the deposition at issue in <em>Rocky Mountain Enterprises </em>was not excluded based on its content, as was Rievman\u2019s deposition in the instant case. More importantly, M. R. Civ. P. 32(a) outlines circumstances in which depositions may be admissible at trial, but also specifies that the use of such depositions is proper only \u201cso far as admissible under the rules of evidence applied as though the witness were then present and testifying.\u201d Thus, the fact that a deposition qualifies for admission under one of the several provisions of M. R. Civ. P. 32(a) does not negate the applicability of other evidentiary rules. In other words, M. R. Civ. P. 32(a) does not trump other evidentiary rules which may justify excluding a deposition when its contents are irrelevant, unfairly prejudicial, or objectionable on any other grounds. Simply put, the Defendants\u2019 interpretation of our decision in <em>Rocky Mountain Enterprises </em>is inconsistent with M. R. Civ. P. 32(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">\u00b671 The Defendants do not argue that the District Court abused its discretion, nor do they challenge the court\u2019s determination that Rievman\u2019s deposition posed a \u201cpotential for confusion and misunderstanding\u201d which heightened the \u201cneed for precise examination at trial.\u201d Thus, because the Defendants\u2019 reliance on <em>Rocky Mountain Enterprises </em>is inconsistent with M. R. Civ. P. 32(a), and because they do not actually challenge the basis for the District Court\u2019s ruling, we conclude that the Defendants have failed to demonstrate that the court abused its discretion in excluding Rievman\u2019s deposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">Affidavits</p>\n<p id=\"b274-7\">\u00b672 One of the central issues to be determined in a malicious prosecution claim is whether the party that instigated the underlying lawsuit lacked probable cause for doing so. <em>Plouffe v. Mont. DPHHS, </em>2002 MT 64, \u00b6 20, 309 Mont. 184, \u00b6 20, 45 P.3d 10, \u00b6 20. As we indicated in <em>Plouffe, </em>this determination turns on the facts known to the suing party at the time the lawsuit was filed. <em>Plouffe, </em>\u00b6 18. Relying on <em>Plouffe, </em>the District Court instructed the jury to make the probable cause determination based on the facts known to the Defendants when they sued Seltzer. The District Court also instructed the jury that in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>making this determination \u201cyou may consider whether defendant could or should have made further inquiry or investigation as an ordinarily prudent person would have made in the same circumstances before initiating such a lawsuit.\u201d In rendering this portion of the instructions, the District Court relied on <em>Rickman v. Safeway Stores, Inc., </em>124 Mont. 451, 458-59, 227 P.2d 607, 611 (1951), a malicious prosecution case wherein this Court indicated that instigating a legal proceeding without first making a reasonable inquiry or investigation is grounds for finding a lack of probable cause. Consideration of the suing party\u2019s investigation prior to filing suit is consistent with our holding in <em>Plouffe </em>that a determination of probable cause must take into account the totality of the circumstances. <em>Plouffe, </em>\u00b6 19. The Defendants do not challenge these instructions on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-4\">\u00b673 At trial, in accordance with <em>Plouffe, </em>the District Court precluded the Defendants from presenting information they obtained <em>after </em>suit was filed as a means of establishing probable cause. The Defendants were, of course, allowed to present the evidence they had <em>at the time </em>the suit was filed in arguing that probable cause existed. Seltzer, in turn, argued that this evidence was insufficient to establish probable cause. Seltzer also presented evidence to demonstrate that the Defendants did not conduct a reasonable investigation regarding the painting\u2019s authenticity and, that if they had done so, they would have discovered readily available information supporting Seltzer\u2019s opinion that it was not an authentic Russell.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">\u00b674 For example, upon questioning by Seltzer\u2019s counsel, the Defendants admitted that they had not established a complete provenance for the paintingbefore suing Seltzer. Morton admitted that he had not even made an effort to discover the provenance from 1913 to 1939 before filing the lawsuit. The Defendants also admitted that, despite their knowledge of the Montana Historical Society and the C. M. Russell Museum, they did not bother to contact these institutions to obtain relevant information before suing Seltzer. Further, the Defendants admitted that, other than their communications with Seltzer and Ginger Renner, they did not take any steps to have the painting authenticated by a Russell expert before suing Seltzer. Seltzer\u2019s counsel also solicited testimony from an experienced trial attorney, Tom Lewis, indicating that the Defendants\u2019 failure, before filing the lawsuit, to obtain an expert willing to testify that the painting was a Russell, constituted a significant deficiency in their investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">\u00b675 Seltzer testified that the Defendants could have obtained relevant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>information from the C. M. Russell Museum and the Montana Historical Society, both of which contain an abundant amount of information regarding Russell and his work. Seltzer also testified that these institutions would have directed the Defendants to individuals with expert knowledge regarding Russell artwork, such as Robert Morgan, formerly the Curator of Collections at the Montana Historical Society for fifteen years. Morgan has appraised the work of Western artists throughout his lengthy career in the art world, including the work of O. C. Seltzer, and he is an acknowledged authority on Russell\u2019s work, having appraised and authenticated several hundred Russell pieces over the last forty years.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-4\">\u00b676 Additionally, Seltzer presented Morgan\u2019s affidavit, which Seltzer had obtained while defending himself in the underlying suit, wherein Morgan stated his opinion that the painting was not an authentic Russell. Seltzer also presented the eight other affidavits he had obtained in the underlying suit, including affidavits of experts closely associated with the Montana Historical Society and the C. M. Russell Museum, as well as the affidavits of Ginger Renner, and Bob Drummond, all of whom opined that the painting was not an authentic Russell.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">\u00b677 The Defendants argue that the District Court erred in admitting the affidavits. Specifically, the Defendants argue that the affidavits were irrelevant to the probable cause inquiry because they were acquired after the lawsuit was filed and, pursuant to <em>Plouffe, </em>the probable cause inquiry turns on information known by the suing party at the time suit was filed. Additionally, the Defendants argue that the admission of the affidavits was particularly unfair in light of the fact that Defendants were not allowed to present evidence they had acquired after filing suit as a means to establish probable cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">\u00b678 Defendants rely on the fact that Seltzer acquired these affidavits after the underlying lawsuit was filed. However, Defendants do not claim that they were unaware of the information contained in these affidavits when the suit was filed. In fact, the record demonstrates that the Defendants <em>were </em>aware of the opinions of Ginger Renner and Bob Drummond as expressed in these affidavits. Thus, Defendants\u2019 complaint about these particular affidavits is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-7\">\u00b679 As for the remaining affidavits, even assuming that the Defendants were not aware of the information contained therein, no error is apparent here. Seltzer presented the affidavits as part of the evidence regarding the adequacy of Defendants\u2019 investigation prior to filing suit. As evidence of information that was readily available, these <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>affidavits were relevant to the issue of whether Defendants conducted a reasonable investigation before filing suit. <em>Rickman, </em>124 Mont. at 458-59, 227 P.2d at 611; <em>Plouffe, </em>\u00b6 19. The Defendants do not dispute that Seltzer was entitled to present evidence regarding the reasonableness of their investigation underlying the lawsuit. Further, the Defendants do not dispute that Seltzer was entitled to demonstrate that numerous individuals could have provided Defendants with expert opinions regarding the authenticity of the painting had the Defendants actually sought such information. The affidavits simply showed (assuming the information contained therein was not known by the Defendants) what specific information the Defendants could have obtained with minimal investigative effort prior to filing suit against Seltzer. Thus, we perceive no error in the District Court\u2019s decision to admit the affidavits, and there certainly is no indication that the court \u201cacted arbitrarily without conscientious judgment or exceeded the bounds of reason\u201d in doing so. <em>See Lopez, </em>\u00b6 14. Accordingly, we conclude that the Defendants have failed to demonstrate that the District Court abused its discretion in admitting the affidavits.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-4\">Expert Testimony</p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">\u00b680 Prior to trial, the parties disputed the propriety of expert testimony on various subjects. Accordingly, the District Court entered its Omnibus Order which, inter alia, set parameters for the testimony of Duane Chartier, an expert in art conservation, and the testimony of Tom Lewis, an expert trial attorney. At trial, Chartier testified regarding, inter alia, the reputation of the Amon Carter Museum and the Kennedy Galleries, the significance of a gap in a painting\u2019s provenance, and the kind of analysis and methodology that is reasonably relied upon by knowledgeable people in the art world in determining whether artwork has been altered. Lewis testified regarding, inter alia, the nature and implications of the claims asserted in the underlying suit against Seltzer, and the responsibility that attorneys have, prior to filing a lawsuit, to verify that a factual basis exists to support the suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">\u00b681 The Defendants now challenge the District Court\u2019s decision requiring that they submit in writing, for pre-approval, the questions they intended to ask Chartier. The Defendants also argue that the District Court erred in allowing Lewis\u2019s testimony, claiming that he testified on subjects outside his area of expertise and invaded the province of the jury by offering legal conclusions and applying the law to the facts of the case. We determine that these arguments are flawed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>by virtue of inadequacy.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-4\">\u00b682 As noted above, when considering a district court\u2019s evidentiary rulings, we do not merely determine whether the rulings constitute an abuse of discretion; we must also determine whether the impact of a demonstrated abuse of discretion warrants reversal. <em>In re </em>A.N., \u00b6 55. Here, although the Defendants contest the District Court\u2019s evidentiary rulings, they present no explanation as to how these alleged errors could have affected their substantial rights or affected the outcome of the trial. Without providing such an explanation, the Defendants cannot demonstrate that a reversible error has occurred here. Moreover, we are not obligated to develop such an argument on behalf of an appellant. <em>In re Estate of Bayers, </em>1999 MT 154, \u00b6 19, 295 Mont. 89, \u00b6 19, 983 P.2d 339, \u00b6 19. Accordingly, we will not address these inadequate contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">Cumulative Impact</p>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">\u00b683 Finally, the Defendants assert, with no supporting analysis, that the \u201ccumulative impact\u201d of the District Court\u2019s evidentiary rulings \u201cpreordained the outcome\u201d of the trial.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> As for the District Court\u2019s decision to preclude the use of Rievman\u2019s deposition in favor of live testimony, the Defendants have failed to demonstrate that the court abused its discretion in any way. Similarly, as for the District Court\u2019s decision to admit the affidavits as evidence of information the Defendants could have obtained with minimal investigative effort prior to filing suit against Seltzer, the Defendants have failed to demonstrate that the court abused its discretion in any way. And as for the court\u2019s decisions regarding expert testimony, the Defendants have failed to present any explanation as to how the alleged error could have affected their substantial rights or affected the outcome of the trial. Accordingly, we will not reverse the District Court based on the \u201ccumulative impact\u201d of its evidentiary rulings.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-7\">\u00b684 (4) Are the Defendants entitled to a new trial or remittitur based on Seltzer\u2019s closing argument?</p>\n<p id=\"b278-8\">\u00b685 The Defendants argue that Seltzer\u2019s counsel made improper <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>closing arguments that caused the jury to act with passion and prejudice in rendering the punitive damages award. The Defendants characterize these remarks as \u201cappeals to local sympathies\u201d which were intended to foster prejudice against them. Upon these contentions, the Defendants argue that they are entitled to \u201ca new trial or significant remittitur.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b279-4\">\u00b686 In support of this argument, the Defendants specify the following remarks as improper. First, Seltzer\u2019s counsel stated that Seltzer was \u201cbom and raised here in Great Falls\u201d and had \u201c[m]ade this his home.\u201d The transcript reveals that this statement was made as a part of counsel\u2019s argument that Seltzer\u2019s reputation had been damaged by the Defendants\u2019 allegations of intentional wrongdoing. Given that this statement was merely a recitation of facts that were previously presented during trial without objection, and given the evidence indicating that Seltzer suffered reputational harm in the Great Falls community, we find nothing inappropriate in counsel's observation regarding Seltzer\u2019s history and residence in Great Falls.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">\u00b687 Second, Seltzer\u2019s counsel referred to GDC in one instance as a \u201cgreat law firm from Los Angeles.\u201d As was the former statement, this remark was grounded in the evidence ofrecord-i.e., the facts regarding GDC\u2019s size and location were presented to the jury during trial. Moreover, it is undisputed that the evidence of GDC\u2019s size and location was properly admitted. Thus, we find nothing inappropriate in this statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">\u00b688 Third, counsel argued that GDC had sought to \u201cuse their power and their prestige and their situation as this 800 person law firm to wreak terror and harm on Steve Seltzer.\u201d One of the jury\u2019s primary tasks was to determine the Defendants\u2019 purpose in suing Seltzer. The transcript reveals that counsel prefaced this comment by stating that it was a conclusion supported by the evidence. Defendants present no authority indicating counsel was not entitled to argue that the evidence supported particular conclusions. Further, counsel\u2019s reference here to GDC\u2019s size was merely reflective of evidence that was presented at trial, the admission of which has not been appealed. Thus, we find nothing inappropriate in counsel\u2019s remark. Moreover, we note that immediately prior to counsel\u2019s argument the District Court provided appropriate context by instructing the jury: \u201cYou are not to regard arguments, statements and remarks of attorneys as evidence, and you should disregard them if they are not supported by evidence properly presented and received.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b279-7\">\u00b689 Finally, counsel stated: \u201cThey sued [Seltzer]. Because they figured <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>[he] was not going to be able to defend himself up here in old Great Falls, Montana.\u201d Again, one of the jury\u2019s primary tasks was to determine the Defendants\u2019 purpose in filing the underlying suit. The transcript reveals that counsel made this remark in questioning the Defendants\u2019 motives for suing Seltzer rather than the Kennedy Galleries, which sold the painting to the Mortons, or Stuart Johnson of the Coeur d\u2019Alene Art Auction, who initially questioned the authenticity of the painting when Morton first sought to sell it. Thus, we find nothing inappropriate in counsel\u2019s remark to the extent that it addresses the issue of intent. To the extent this remark may have suggested to the jury that Defendants took a dim view of Great Falls or saw the city as a favorable location in which to sue Seltzer, we find this shade of meaning insufficient to establish any significant level of prejudice. Further, we note again that the District Court provided appropriate context for counsel\u2019s remarks by instructing the jury members, immediately beforehand, that they were not to regard counsel\u2019s arguments as evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-4\">\u00b690 Of course, it would have been improper for counsel to suggest that the jury determine compensatory or punitive liability based on Seltzer\u2019s status as an individual Montanan and GDC\u2019s status as a large, out-of-state law firm. However, there is nothing inappropriate in mentioning the relative size, position, and attributes of the litigants in a closing argument when those facts were presented during the trial. Indeed, the Defendants have not appealed the District Court\u2019s ruling <em>in limine </em>that evidence regarding GDC\u2019s \u201cinstitutional reputation, size, published hourly rates, and marketed scope of work are highly relevant and admissible evidence as to Seltzer\u2019s claimed emotional distress\u201d and other aspects of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">\u00b691 The Defendants cite no authority to support their assertion that counsel\u2019s remarks were improper. Rather, they merely rely on their characterization of these remarks in asserting that the jury acted with passion and prejudice in rendering the punitive verdict. We note that the District Court guarded against such an outcome by instructing the jury, immediately prior to closing arguments, to \u201cweigh and consider this case without sympathy, passion or prejudice for or against any party or person.\u201d We also note that the challenged remarks represent a very small portion of counsel\u2019s closing argument, which takes up more than twenty-two pages in the trial transcript.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-6\">\u00b692 Moreover, none of the challenged remarks were made during counsel\u2019s arguments in the punitive damages proceedings, which were held after the jury rendered its first verdict awarding compensatory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>damages. In the subsequent punitive damages proceedings, Seltzer\u2019s counsel offered only a few comments to the jury and did not argue for any particular amount of punitive damages against GDC, instead stating: \u2018You can determine what the appropriate amount is. And the idea is, obviously, not to bankrupt this company. That\u2019s not the idea at all. The idea is to assess an amount that you think will deter them and that you think will punish them appropriately.\u201d Finally, counsel made each of the challenged remarks in different contexts and at different stages in his argument, and we will not view them out of context as they are presented by the Defendants here. Accordingly, having considered the challenged remarks both individually and collectively in the context of counsel's entire closing argument, we reject the Defendants\u2019 argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-4\">\u00b693 (5) Is the jury\u2019s award of compensatory damages supported by substantial credible evidence?</p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">\u00b694 The jury\u2019s function is to weigh and resolve conflicts in the evidence, to judge the credibility of the witnesses, and to make the factual determinations necessary to render a verdict, including the determination of compensatory damages to be awarded. <em>Sandman v. Farmers Ins. Exchange, </em>1998 MT 286, \u00b6 45, 291 Mont. 456, \u00b6 45, 969 P.2d 277, \u00b6 45; <em>Onstad v. Payless Shoesource, </em>2000 MT 230, \u00b6 50, 301 Mont. 259, \u00b6 50, 9 P.3d 38, \u00b6 50 (overruled in part on other grounds in <em>Johnson v. Costco Wholesale, </em>2007 MT 43, \u00b6 21, 336 Mont. 105, \u00b6 21, 152 P.3d 727, \u00b6 21). This Court \u201cmust exercise the greatest self-restraint in interfering with the constitutionally mandated processes ofjury decision.\u201d <em>Kneeland v. Luzenac America Inc., </em>1998 MT 136, \u00b6 53, 289 Mont. 201, \u00b6 53, 961 P.2d 725, \u00b6 53. Accordingly, the scope of our review of a jury verdict in a civil case is \u201cnecessarily very limited.\u201d <em>Kneeland, </em>\u00b6 45. We do not substitute our judgment for that of the jury-i.e., we do not repeat the jury\u2019s tasks so as to determine whether we would have rendered the same verdict had we been in the jury\u2019s position. <em>Onstad, </em>\u00b6 50; <em>French v. Ralph E. Moore, Inc., </em>203 Mont. 327, 336, 661 P.2d 844, 849 (1983). Rather, this Court defers to the jury\u2019s constitutionally sanctioned decisional role, Article II, \u00a7 26, as it is not our role to retry a case or reweigh evidence on appeal, <em>Smith v. General Mills, Inc., </em>1998 MT 280, \u00b6 19, 291 Mont. 426, \u00b6 19, 968 P.2d 723, \u00b6 19. Thus, our task on review is simply to determine whether the verdict is supported by substantial credible evidence, which is defined as evidence that a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion. <em>Satterfield v. Medlin, </em>2002 MT 260, \u00b6 23, 312 Mont. 234, \u00b6 23, 59 P.3d 33, \u00b6 23. In making this determination, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the prevailing party. <em>Satterfield, </em>\u00b6 13. Moreover, as we have held, the prevailing party is entitled to any reasonable Inference that can be drawn from the facts. <em>Sandman, </em>\u00b6 41. As it is the jury\u2019s function to determine the weight and credibility of the evidence, this Court has held that evidence will be considered substantial even if we view it as \u201cinherently weak and conflicting\u201d and \u201csomewhat less than a preponderance\u201d; however, it must consist of \u201cmore than a mere scintilla of evidence\u201d and it must rise above the level of \u201ctrifling or frivolous.\u201d <em>Sandman, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 40, 41.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-4\">\u00b695 As noted above, the jury awarded Seltzer $1.1 million in compensatory damages. The Defendants argue that this award is excessive and is not supported by the evidence. In support of this argument, the Defendants characterize the jury\u2019s compensatory verdict solely as an \u201cemotional distress award\u201d and claim that it is larger than any \u201cemotional distress award\u201d ever upheld on appeal in Montana\u2019s history. The Defendants also present a chart summarizing emotional distress awards upheld on appeal in Montana, and suggest that we should evaluate the compensatory award here in light of the smaller awards in these other cases and thus set aside or significantly reduce the jury\u2019s compensatory award.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">\u00b696  We note that the Defendants cite no authority for the notion that we may meddle with a jury\u2019s compensatory verdict in one case based on the size of a compensatory verdict rendered in another case. More to the point, we have already rejected this approach. In <em>Onstad, </em>where we considered whether a substantial compensatory award was \u201cexcessive and unsupported by the evidence,\u201d the appellants suggested that we consider the size of awards in other cases in rendering our decision. <em>Onstad, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 1, 48, 49. We declined to do so and, instead, made our decision based solely on the facts in the case before us. <em>Onstad, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 50-52. Similarly here, we reject the notion that a compensatory award for emotional distress upheld in one case is in any way relevant to the propriety or size of an emotional distress award in another case. Indeed, two victims of the same tortious conduct may be impacted in dramatically different ways. Moreover, the proper measure of compensatory damages must be determined solely based on the facts of each case, <em>French, </em>203 Mont. at 336, 661 P.2d at 849, and juries have wide latitude in this regard, <em>Gibson v. Western Fire Ins. </em>Co., 210 Mont. 267, 290, 682 P.2d 725, 738 (1984). Thus, one jury may legitimately render a compensatory award that is significantly different from an equally legitimate compensatory award rendered by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>another jury upon substantially similar facts. It simply is not our role to ensure any level of uniformity among compensatory awards in different cases-even cases with similar factual scenarios.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Rather, as noted above, we must exercise \u201cthe greatest self-restraint in interfering with the constitutionally mandated processes of jury decision,\u201d <em>Kneeland, </em>\u00b6 53, and recognize that it is the jury\u2019s function to weigh and resolve conflicts in the evidence, to judge the credibility of the witnesses, and to make the factual determinations necessary to render a verdict, <em>Sandman, </em>\u00b6 45. Thus, we will not consider compensatory awards rendered and upheld in other cases in determining the propriety of the compensatory award at issue here.</p>\n<p id=\"A-X\">\u00b697  Moreover, we reject the Defendants\u2019 assertion that the award here simply represents compensation for emotional distress. As discussed below, Seltzer not only presented evidence of emotional distress resulting from Defendants\u2019 acts, he also presented evidence that his personal and professional reputation was harmed and that he incurred substantial expense in defending himself. Consistent with this evidence, the instructions given by the District Court directed the jury to determine compensatory damages, if finding for Seltzer on the question of liability, upon consideration of \u201cthe following elements of damages: (1) reasonable attorney fees incurred in defending against the underlying lawsuit; (2) injury to plaintiffs reputation resulting from defendants\u2019 acts; (3) emotional distress resulting from defendants\u2019 acts.\u201d The jury\u2019s verdict did not designate a separate amount of compensation awarded for each of these three elements of damage; it merely listed one amount rendered for all compensatory damages.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Thus, it is impossible to know how the jury apportioned the compensatory award with respect to the three elements of damage, and we certainly will not speculate in this regard. Accordingly, we reject the Defendants\u2019 assertion that the compensatory award represents compensation solely for emotional distress. Similarly, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>also reject Seltzer\u2019s assertion that \u201cthe compensatory damages were comprised mainly of the extensive damages to Seltzer\u2019s reputation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Aph\">\u00b698 The Defendants also assert that the compensatory award was not \u201cbased on the actual harm Plaintiff claimed to have suffered, but rather was based on the amount of money Plaintiff could potentially have lost if Defendants had won the underlying lawsuit.\u201d We find this assertion purely speculative and unsupported by the record. As noted above, the instructions given by the District Court directed the jury to determine compensatory damages, if finding for Seltzer on the question of liability, simply upon consideration of reasonable attorney fees incurred by Seltzer in defending against the underlying lawsuit, injury to Seltzer\u2019s reputation resulting from Defendants\u2019 acts, and emotional distress resulting from Defendants\u2019 acts. The instructions did not allow the jury to award compensatory damages based on any other factors, and we will not assume that the jury disregarded the given instructions by rendering a verdict based on Seltzer\u2019s potential loss in the underlying suit. Thus, we reject the Defendants\u2019 assertion.</p>\n<p id=\"Agx\">\u00b699 Additionally, the Defendants assert that the jury\u2019s compensatory award \u201cwas not intended to compensate Plaintiff for his actual losses\u201d but \u201cwas intended to punish Defendants.\u201d Again, we find this assertion purely speculative and unsupported by the record. Defendants provide no analysis to support this assertion. Rather, they merely cite to a portion of <em>State Farm Mutual Auto. Ins. Co. v. Campbell, </em>538 U.S. 408, 123 S.Ct. 1513 (2003), wherein the United States Supreme Court, in discussing a compensatory damages award for emotional distress and a punitive damages award, stated that the compensatory damages assessed \u201clikely were based on a component which was duplicated in the punitive award.\u201d <em>Campbell, </em>538 U.S. at 426, 123 S.Ct. at 1525. The Supreme Court then noted: \u201cMuch of the distress was caused by the outrage and humiliation the Campbells suffered at the actions of their insurer; and it is a major role of punitive damages to condemn such conduct.\u201d <em>Campbell, </em>538 U.S. at 426, 123 S.Ct. at 1525.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-4\">\u00b6100 However, the <em>Campbell </em>Court was discussing a compensatory award rendered simply for emotional distress damages, <em>Campbell, </em>538 U.S. at 426, 123 S.Ct. at 1524, whereas the compensatory award at issue here, as noted above, cannot be characterized purely as compensation for emotional distress.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">\u00b6101 Nothing in the record suggests that the jury \u201cintended to punish Defendants\u201d with the compensatory award rather than simply compensating Seltzer for his actual losses, and it certainly is not appropriate for this Court to engage in the rank speculation necessary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>to reach such a conclusion. First, the instructions cautioned the jury against acting on such an improper impulse, stating: \u201cyou must weigh and consider this case without sympathy, passion or prejudice for or against any party or person.\u201d Second, the instructions did not allow the jury to award compensatory damages as a means of punishing the Defendants. Rather, as noted above, the instructions clearly delineated three distinct factors for the jury\u2019s consideration in rendering a compensatory award-attorney fees, reputational harm, and emotional distress-and we will not assume that the jury members violated their oath of service by disregarding the given instructions. Thus, we reject the Defendants\u2019 assertion.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-4\">\u00b6102 Finally, having reviewed the record in light of the applicable standards noted above, we disagree with the Defendants\u2019 primary argument that the evidence is insufficient to justify the jury\u2019s award of compensatory damages. As noted above, Seltzer presented evidence supporting three types of damage he sustained as a result of the Defendants\u2019 conduct. First, Seltzer presented evidence demonstrating that he incurred over $45,000.00 in attorney fees in defending himself in the underlying lawsuit. In conjunction with this proof, Seltzer presented evidence demonstrating that the defense work performed by his counsel in the underlying suit was reasonable and necessary under the circumstances. Accordingly, the District Court concluded: \u201cas a result of Defendants\u2019 tortious conduct, Seltzer reasonably incurred substantial attorney fees and costs in his defense of the underlying lawsuit.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">\u00b6103 Second, Seltzer presented evidence demonstrating that he suffered serious damage to his personal and professional reputation as a result of the Defendants\u2019 conduct. It is undisputed that prior to the underlying lawsuit Seltzer maintained a sterling reputation in both the local and national Western art community which he had developed over the course of forty years. Seltzer testified: \u201cI\u2019d worked hard all my life to become an expert and competent [as an authenticator and appraiser] and a great painter. And I\u2019d taken every opportunity to become involved in authentication work regarding O. C. Seltzer and I\u2019d just made a lifelong study of it.\u201d His reputation was such that he was often called upon by individuals, art galleries, and auction houses throughout the United States, including prominent auction houses such as Sotheby\u2019s and Christie\u2019s, to perform authentication and appraisal work. Additionally, Seltzer had sold his own paintings in virtually every state in the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-6\">\u00b6104 After the Defendants filed the underlying suit, news of their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>accusations against Seltzer spread throughout the local community at large, as well as the local and national art community. True West Magazine and the Main Antique Digest both ran articles regarding the lawsuit, as did the leading newspaper in Seltzer\u2019s hometown, the Great Falls Tribune. Further, news of Defendants\u2019 accusations against Seltzer circulated, inter alia, among local community groups in Great Falls, the C. M. Russell Museum\u2019s National Advisory Board, and museums and galleries throughout the United States-institutions that had direct contact with potential customers of Seltzer\u2019s authentication and appraisal services and his own artwork.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-4\">\u00b6105 Seltzer testified that the amount of authentication work he receives is a function of his reputation in the art world, and that while he had performed hundreds of authentications in the years prior to the underlying lawsuit, he had received only one authentication request in the subsequent three years. Randy Gray, the former President of the Board of C. M. Russell Museum, testified, based on his involvement in the annual C. M. Russell Art Auction and discussions with art collectors and members of the museum\u2019s National Advisory Board, that Seltzer\u2019s reputation had been tainted as a result of the allegations made in the underlying lawsuit. Similarly, Seltzer\u2019s wife testified, based on her communications with many individuals in various groups in the Great Falls community and at the C. M. Russell Art Auction, that the lawsuit had damaged Seltzer\u2019s reputation because it caused these people to question his integrity and honesty.</p>\n<p id=\"AmD\">\u00b6106 Consistent with the aforementioned evidence, as well as other evidence presented at trial, the District Court found:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b286-5\">Over his lifetime, Steve Seltzer developed, in the Great Falls community and in the western art community locally and nationally, an impeccable and highly respected reputation for general honesty, as a quality commercial artist, as the foremost expert and authenticator of O. C. Seltzer art, and in relation to his association with the prestigious C. M. Russell Art Auction. As a result of a few publications and word of mouth in the western art world and in the local community, word of the Mortons\u2019 lawsuit damaged Steve Seltzer\u2019s reputation in western art circles and in the local community.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b286-6\">The court ultimately found that the harm Defendants caused Seltzer was \u201cserious damage to his personal and professional reputation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AiQ\">\u00b6107 Third, Seltzer presented evidence demonstrating that the Defendants\u2019 conduct caused him emotional distress and resultant physical complications. Among other things, Seltzer presented the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>letter he received from the Defendants in April of 2002 which threatened litigation and stated \u201cyou will draft a letter to our specifications completely recanting and withdrawing any statement you have previously made regarding the authenticity of the painting.\u201d The letter also stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b287-4\">2. In the letter, among other admissions you will make, you will admit that you did not perform a detailed examination of the painting and that your \u201copinion\u201d was merely conjecture on your part.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b287-5\">3. You will agree to compensate Mr. Morton for the difference between what the painting sells for today, after we have tried to remove the cloud from its provenance, and what it could have sold for two years ago prior to your defamatory remarks about its authenticity.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b287-6\">4. Independently, you will reimburse Mr. Morton for the time, expense, embarrassment, grief and anxiety he has expended in trying to recover from your actions. The price: an additional $50,000 beyond the loss in value of the painting.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b287-7\">In conclusion, the letter stated: \u201cWe expect immediate cooperation on the drafting of your \u2018withdrawal of opinion\u2019 or litigation will be filed without any further discussion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b287-8\">\u00b6108 Following receipt of this letter, Seltzer sought and obtained information regarding GDC on the internet. As he testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b287-9\">I discovered that they were a very big firm. The main office was in Southern California, but they had offices all over the world. There was in the neighborhood of 800 attorneys in this firm. And they touted themselves as being a pretty big, powerful and influential firm.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b287-10\">At this point, Seltzer testified, he began experiencing anxiety.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-11\">\u00b6109 Seltzer also presented the Defendants\u2019 second threatening letter, which he received roughly two months later, and the Summons and Complaint which was served on him in July of2002. Upon reading the Complaint, Seltzer testified, he realized that the Defendants were formally seeking recovery in excess of $700,000.00 as compensation for the alleged loss. As for the Defendants\u2019 additional claim for punitive damages, Seltzer testified that he understood the nature of punitive damages and knew that punitive awards \u201ccan amount to millions of dollars.\u201d As for the Defendants\u2019 additional claim for attorney fees and costs, Seltzer testified: \u201cI knew that if I had to pay attorney\u2019s fees, I knew that was going to be a huge sum of money because this-as big as this firm was, I was pretty sure that they charged a whole lot of money <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>for their services.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b288-4\">\u00b6110 At this point, Seltzer testified, he experienced <em>\u201ca </em>state of panic\u201d as a result of the financial implications posed by the lawsuit, as well as the potential impact on his reputation in the art community. He testified: \u201cI was fearful of losing everything that I had. Everything that my wife and I had worked for 37 years to accumulate. I mean, my home, my art studios, my cars. All my personal belongings.\u201d Seltzer further testified: \u201cI was being wrongfully sued here and I was facing the prospect of financial disaster. Bankruptcy.\u201d Additionally, Seltzer testified: \u201cWith the comments they were making and the allegations here [in the Complaint], I felt that it was clearly gonna be a real problem for my reputation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b288-6\">\u00b6111 Seltzer then sought to protect himself. Having resolved to maintain his professional integrity and not recant his opinion, Seltzer testified, he contacted a bankruptcy attorney in August of 2002 to determine whether he could protect some of his assets in the event of an adverse judgment. Following a consultation with this attorney, Seltzer filed a \u201cDeclaration of Homestead\u201d with the Clerk and Recorder so as to protect a portion of the equity he had built up in his home. As for the prospect of defending himself, Seltzer testified that he could not afford the expense of legal representation and he hoped Safeco Insurance would cover this cost through his homeowner\u2019s insurance policy. Accordingly, he wrote a letter to his Safeco insurance agent, enclosing a copy of the Summons and Complaint. With this letter, Seltzer asked the agent to contact Safeco to determine whether the homeowner\u2019s policy would provide coverage for defense costs. Safeco responded with a letter denying any coverage. In securing legal representation, Seltzer and his counsel in the underlying suit executed an agreement which obligated Seltzer to pay the costs and attorney fees incurred in the litigation, but also expressly acknowledged that he did not have sufficient funds to pay the hourly attorney fees at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-7\">\u00b6112 As noted, Seltzer testified that when he was served with the Summons and Complaint he initially experienced <em>\u201ca </em>state of panic.\u201d Thereafter, Seltzer testified, he experienced a \u201chigh level of anxiety\u201d which was accompanied by physical complications including irregular bowel function, perpetual upset stomach, and sleeplessness. He stated that he \u201cwas in a constant state of diarrhea or constipation\u201d and further stated: \u201cit was an all-consuming sort of a thing. I couldn\u2019t sleep at night. I lay awake til all hours of the night-thinking of this disaster that I\u2019d got myself into and-my stomach was always upset.\u201d Seltzer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>also testified: \u201cI think you can\u2019t appreciate what-just how debilitating this-this anxiety can be, unless you really experience it. Now-it saps your energy level, it saps your vitality. I was tired all the time.\u201d Additionally, Seltzer testified that although he was absolutely confident the painting was an O. C. Seltzer, he feared that the Defendants might be able to manipulate the legal system to cause a failure of justice and bring financial ruin upon himself and his wife. Particularly, he feared that the Defendants might \u201ccome up with some bogus expert from somewhere that\u2019ll back them up in this claim that this is a Russell... I couldn\u2019t see any other way that they could possibly prosecute this case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b289-4\">\u00b6113 Seltzer\u2019s wife testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b289-5\">He was absolutely a nervous wreck. Totally stressed out. We were being faced with bankruptcy. Financial ruin. He had extreme stomach problems. He couldn\u2019t sleep at night. He became very tense and irritable. He was consumed by this. Every minute he was consumed ... he was confident he could prove that this was his grandfather\u2019s work. He never wavered on that. But there was a huge amount of pressure on him. And he became physically ill as a result of that.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b289-6\">She further testified that, as a result of his physical condition during the progression of the lawsuit, Seltzer had to use the bathroom at least four to five times per night on a regular basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-7\">\u00b6114 In August of2002, Seltzer\u2019s wife prompted him to consult with Dr. John T. Molloy, a physician in Great Falls who specializes in internal medicine and gastroenterology. Seltzer described his symptoms to Dr. Molloy and also explained the circumstances of the lawsuit. Dr. Molloy testified at trial that Seltzer \u201cwas lucid, and he was not suicidal at all, but he was under tremendous distress.\u201d Consequently, Dr. Molloy instructed Seltzer to take Paxil, a drug which Molloy stated is \u201ca type of anti-depressant medication, but it has some features that are very helpful in anxiety disorders.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b289-8\">\u00b6115 Seltzer took the Paxil for roughly three weeks; however, as he and his wife testified, it did not ameliorate his anxiety or his physical symptoms. Thereafter, Seltzer and his wife testified, his condition did not improve as the lawsuit progressed. Eventually, Seltzer\u2019s wife became concerned that Seltzer\u2019s physical problems could be caused by something more serious than the stress of the lawsuit, and she again prompted him to consult with Dr. Molloy. At an appointment in December of 2002, Seltzer described his continuing anxiety and physical symptoms, and explained how the lawsuit had progressed. At <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>this point, as Dr. Molloy testified, he believed that Seltzer\u2019s irregular bowel function and other physical problems were caused by the stress of the lawsuit. However, Molloy nonetheless advised Seltzer to undergo a colonoscopy in order to rule out the possibility that his complications were a result of a physical disorder such as cancer or inflammatory bowel disease. In January of2003, Dr. Molloy performed the procedure which revealed that Seltzer\u2019s colon was normal. Consequently, Dr. Molloy concluded that the stress resulting from the lawsuit, rather than any physical disorder, was the sole cause of Seltzer\u2019s symptoms.</p>\n<p id=\"As9\">\u00b6116 At trial, Dr. Molloy testified that, in his opinion, Seltzer had experienced a serious and severe level of stress that caused his gastrointestinal complications. In explaining the basis for his opinion, Dr. Molloy testified that, through a neurologic mechanism, serious emotional distress can cause gastrointestinal problems such as those experienced by Seltzer. Molloy further explained, among other things, that the human intestinal tract reacts to stress by way of receptors in the brain which \u201ccan activate bowel function at an inappropriate time and in an inappropriate way. And so ... stress, through activity in the brain, causes the intestinal symptom.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b290-4\">\u00b6117 Consistent with the aforementioned evidence, as well as other evidence presented at trial, the District Court found:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b290-5\">Prior to receiving threatening demands from the Mortons\u2019 attorney and becoming the subject of their lawsuit, Steve Seltzer was a healthy and well-adjusted person both physically and mentally. However, due to the nature of the factual and legal allegations asserted against him by the Mortons\u2019 lawsuit, the potential financial rain, the potential professional and social disgrace, his awareness of the size, prominence, and resource advantages of the large and internationally prominent law firm prosecuting him, and his awareness of his own relative lack of resources to defend himself, Steve Seltzer suffered serious and severe emotional distress as a result of the Mortons\u2019 lawsuit against him. Seltzer also suffered from physical complications of his emotional distress, including but not limited to intestinal and bowel problems requiring medical care.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b290-6\">On appeal, the Defendants provide no explanation as to why the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>evidence noted above, or any other evidence presented at trial, is not substantial and credible-i.e., why a reasonable mind could not accept this evidence as adequate to support the jury\u2019s determination of the extent of damage Seltzer suffered. Rather, the Defendants simply assert that the award is \u201cgrossly excessive\u201d because it is larger than awards upheld in other cases. As noted above, we reject this reasoning because each case must be decided on its own merits and because it is not our job to ensure conformity among compensatory verdicts in different cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-4\">\u00b6118 Asa remedy, Defendants request that the compensatory award be \u201cset aside or significantly reduced.\u201d Yet, the Defendants offer no authority or other guidance as to how this Court could legitimately determine a reduction of the award. Nor do the Defendants\u2019 speculative assertions noted above-i.e., that the compensatory award was meant to punish the Defendants and was not based on the actual harm to Seltzer-provide any justification for this Court to take the extraordinary step of setting aside the award altogether. In fact, reducing or setting aside the compensatory award would require us to usurp the jury\u2019s role-in other words, we would have to weigh all the evidence presented at trial, resolve any conflicts in the evidence, judge the credibility of the witnesses based on the cold transcripts, and ultimately make factual findings. However, doing so would be entirely inconsistent with the limited scope of proper appellate review, as these tasks are properly left to the jury. <em>Satterfield, </em>\u00b6 23; <em>Onstad, </em>\u00b6 50; <em>Smith, </em>\u00b6 19; <em>Kneeland, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 45, 53; <em>Sandman, </em>\u00b6 45.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">\u00b6119  Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to Seltzer and drawing all reasonable inferences in his favor, as we must, we conclude that a reasonable juror could accept this evidence as adequately establishing that Seltzer reasonably incurred over $45,000.00 in legal expenses while defending himself; that he suffered serious damage to his personal and professional reputation; and that he suffered serious and severe emotional distress<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> which manifested itself through significant physical complications requiring medical <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>care. We also conclude that a reasonable juror could accept this evidence of legal expenses, reputational damage, and emotional distress, as adequate to establish damages in the amount of $1.1 million resulting from the Defendants\u2019 conduct. Accordingly, we hold that the jury\u2019s award of compensatory damages is supported by substantial credible evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-4\">\u00b6120  In analyzing the compensatory award in its post-verdict order, beyond the findings noted above, the District Court concluded in summary:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-6\">In this case, as a result of Defendants\u2019 tortious conduct, Seltzer reasonably incurred substantial attorney fees and costs in his defense of the underlying lawsuit. Seltzer also suffered serious or severe emotional distress and damage to his personal and professional reputation for integrity and competence as a result of Defendants\u2019 conduct. Substantial credible evidence supports the jury\u2019s compensatory damages award of $1.1 million for reputation damages, emotional distress damages, and economic damages (attorney fees and costs) incurred as a result of Defendants\u2019 commencement and prosecution of the underlying lawsuit. The jury\u2019s compensatory damages award fully and fairly compensated Seltzer for all damages suffered as a result of Defendants\u2019 tortious conduct.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b292-7\">We hold that the court\u2019s conclusion is consistent with the evidence of record and we will therefore not interfere with the jury\u2019s award of compensatory damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-8\">\u00b6121 (6) Did the District Court err in not applying the current statutory cap on punitive damages?</p>\n<p id=\"b292-10\">\u00b6122 The Montana Legislature has limited punitive damages awards by enacting \u00a7 27-1-220(3), MCA, which provides: \u201cAn award for punitive damages may not exceed $10 million or <em>3% </em>of a defendant\u2019s net worth, whichever is less. This subsection does not limit punitive damages that may be awarded in class action lawsuits.\u201d This statute became effective on October 1,2003, nearly eight months after Seltzer filed the instant lawsuit. After the jury rendered its punitive damages verdict, the Defendants argued that \u00a7 27-1-220(3), MCA, requires a reduction of the award. The District Court concluded that this statutory cap is not applicable to Seltzer\u2019s case. We review this conclusion de novo to determine whether the District Court properly interpreted the law. <em>Gomez v. State, </em>1999 MT 67, \u00b6 7, 293 Mont. 531, \u00b6 7, 975 P.2d 1258, \u00b6 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-11\">\u00b6123 In <em>Dvorak v. Huntley Project Irrigation District, </em>196 Mont. 167, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>639 P.2d 62, (1981), the plaintiffs filed a lawsuit seeking compensatory and punitive damages against a government entity, as well as two of its employees, after losing farm crops because the defendants failed to provide water to the plaintiffs\u2019 farm. <em>Dvorak, </em>196 Mont. at 168-69, 639 P.2d at 63. Following trial, \u201cthe jury returned a verdict for plaintiffs in the amount of $5,000 compensatory damages and $40,000 punitive damages against each of the three defendants.\u201d <em>Dvorak, </em>196 Mont. at 169, 639 P.2d at 63. On appeal, this Court considered whether a statute prohibiting punitive damages awards against government entities was applicable to a cause of action that arose before the statute was enacted. <em>Dvorak, </em>196 Mont. at 174-75, 639 P.2d at 66. Article II, Section 18, of the 1972 Montana Constitution provides: \u201cThe state, counties, cities, towns, and all other local governmental entities shall have no immunity from suit for injury to a person or property, except as may be specifically provided by law by a 2/3 vote of each house of the legislature.\u201d Pursuant to Section 18, the Legislature enacted \u00a7 2-9-105, MCA, which provides: \u201cThe state and other governmental entities are immune from exemplary and punitive damages.\u201d In resolving the appeal, this Court observed that the plaintiffs\u2019 cause of action arose in 1974, while \u00a7 2-9-105, MCA, was not enacted until 1977. <em>Dvorak, </em>196 Mont. at 174, 639 P.2d at 66. Even though \u00a7 2-9-105, MCA, was in effect when the jury rendered its verdict in 1980, this Court held that the statute was not applicable to the case because it was enacted after the plaintiffs\u2019 cause of action arose. <em>Dvorak, </em>196 Mont. at 169, 174-75, 639 P.2d at 63, 66.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-4\">\u00b6124 The propriety of this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Dvorak </em>is reflected in <em>Pacific Mutual Life Ins. Co. v. Haslip, </em>499 U.S. 1, 111 S.Ct. 1032 (1991), where the United States Supreme Court reviewed the decision of the Alabama Supreme Court, <em>Pacific Mutual Life Ins. Co. v. Haslip, </em>553 So.2d 537 (Ala. 1989), that affirmed a jury verdict of $200,000.00 in compensatory damages and $840,000.00 in punitive damages.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> In that case, the plaintiff filed suit in 1982, <em>Haslip, </em>499 U.S. at 5, 111 S.Ct. at 1036, and following trial the jury rendered its verdict on August 7, 1987, <em>Haslip, </em>553 So.2d at 539. Nearly two months before the verdict was rendered, on June 11,1987, a statutory cap on punitive damages went into effect in Alabama. <em>Haslip, </em>499 U.S. at 20, n.9, 111 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>S.Ct. at 1044, n.9. In its decision, the United States Supreme Court recognized that \u201c[t]he Alabama Legislature recently enacted a statute that places a $250,000 limit on punitive damages in most cases.\u201d <em>Haslip, </em>499 U.S. at 20, n.9, 111 S.Ct. at 1044, n.9. However, the Supreme Court conducted its analysis of the punitive damages award without regard to this statutory cap, stating: \u201cThe legislation, however, became effective ... after the cause of action in the present case arose and the complaint was filed.\u201d <em>Haslip, </em>499 U.S. at 20, n.9, 111 S.Ct. at 1044, n.9.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-4\">\u00b6125 Here, in its post-verdict order reviewing the punitive damages awards, the District Court relied on <em>Dvorak </em>in concluding that \u201cexcept as otherwise expressly provided by the Legislature, a new law limiting recovery of punitive damages does not apply to punitive damages awarded on a claim that accrued prior to the effective date of the statute.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Thus, observing that Seltzer\u2019s tort claims accrued prior to the effective date of \u00a7 27-1-220(3), MCA, the District Court determined that the statutory cap does not require a reduction of the jury\u2019s punitive damages awards against the Defendants. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">\u00b6126  After initiating their tortious conduct in 2002, the Defendants finally agreed to dismissal of the underlying suit with prejudice on February 6,2003. Thus, Seltzer\u2019s cause of action accrued well before the effective date of \u00a7 27-1-220(3), MCA, i.e., October 1, 2003. <em>Gomez, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 9,10 (pursuant to \u00a7 27-2-102(l)(a), MCA, a tort claim or cause of action accrues when all elements of the claim or cause exist or have occurred, the right to maintain an action on the claim or cause is complete, and a court or other agency is authorized to accept jurisdiction of the action); <em>Plouffe, </em>\u00b6 16 (before an action for malicious prosecution may be maintained, the lawsuit alleged to have been improper must be terminated). Accordingly, just as this Court held in <em>Dvorak </em>that the 1977 statute prohibiting punitive damages against government entities was not applicable to a cause of action that arose <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>in 1974, we also hold that \u00a7 27-1-220(3), MCA, which went into effect on October 1, 2003, is not applicable to this case because Seltzer\u2019s cause of action accrued before that date. Thus, we hold that the District Court did not err, and that \u00a7 27-1-220(3), MCA, does not require a reduction of the jury\u2019s punitive damages award against the Defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-4\">\u00b6127 (7) Did the District Court err in following Montana statutory law regarding evidence of a defendant\u2019s financial condition?</p>\n<p id=\"b295-6\">\u00b6128 Montana statutory law prohibits the admission of evidence of a defendant\u2019s \u201cfinancial affairs, financial condition, and net worth\u201d (hereinafter \u201cfinancial condition\u201d) at trial for the purpose of determining whether the defendant is liable for punitive damages. Section 27-l-221(7)(a), MCA. However, the same statute also provides that evidence of a defendant\u2019s financial condition must be considered during subsequent proceedings wherein the jury determines the appropriate amount of punitive damages to assess. Section 27-l-221(7)(a), MCA. Specifically, this statute provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-7\">Evidence regarding a defendant\u2019s financial affairs, financial condition, and net worth is not admissible in a trial to determine whether a defendant is liable for punitive damages. When the jury returns a verdict finding a defendant liable for punitive damages, the amount of punitive damages must then be determined by the jury in an immediate, separate proceeding and be submitted to the judge for review as provided in subsection (7)(c). In the separate proceeding to determine the amount of punitive damages to be awarded, the defendant\u2019s financial affairs, financial condition, and net worth <em>must </em>be considered.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b295-8\">Section 27-l-221(7)(a), MCA (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b295-9\">\u00b6129 The District Court followed the statutory mandate by allowing evidence of the Defendants\u2019 financial condition only during the punitive damages proceedings, and by instructing the jury to consider this evidence as one factor in assessing the amount of punitive damages. Yet, the Defendants argue that the District Court \u201cerred by admitting evidence of Defendants\u2019 wealth and by instructing the jury to consider wealth in determining the amount of punitive damages.\u201d In support of this argument, Defendants suggest that the final sentence of \u00a7 27-l-221(7)(a), MCA, which requires consideration of the defendant\u2019s financial condition, conflicts with the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>State Farm Mutual Auto. Ins. Co. v. Campbell, </em>538 U.S. 408, 123 S.Ct. 1513 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b296-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>\u00b6130 However, <em>Campbell </em>does not hold that juries may not consider a defendant\u2019s financial condition as a factor in determining an appropriate amount of punitive damages. Rather, the decision criticizes the Utah Supreme Court\u2019s reliance on several factors, including out-of-state conduct and \u201cState Farm\u2019s enormous wealth,\u201d as justification for a punitive award that was presumptively disproportionate given the facts of the case. <em>Campbell, </em>538 U.S. at 426-27, 123 S.Ct. at 1524-25. Particularly, the Supreme Court stated that \u201c[i]n the context of this case\u201d-i.e., where the harm arose from a transaction in the economic realm, the compensatory award was \u201csubstantial,\u201d the victims were not subjected to physical injury, and the victims suffered only minor economic injuries-there must be a presumption against a punitive award that is 145 times larger than the compensatory award. <em>Campbell, </em>538 U.S. at 426, 123 S.Ct. at 1524-25. Having identified this presumption, the Supreme Court rejected the Utah Supreme Court\u2019s reliance on several factors, including \u201cState Farm\u2019s enormous wealth,\u201d as justification for the punitive verdict, stating: \u201cThe wealth of a defendant cannot justify an otherwise unconstitutional punitive damages award.\u201d <em>Campbell, </em>538 U.S. at 427, 123 S.Ct. at 1525.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">\u00b6131 The <em>Campbell </em>decision then notes that consideration of a defendant\u2019s wealth as a factor in determining the amount of punitive damages is not \u201cunlawful or inappropriate.\u201d <em>Campbell, </em>538 U.S. at 427-28, 123 S.Ct. at 1525.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Simply put, <em>Campbell </em>does not support the Defendants\u2019 argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-7\">\u00b6132 Of course, a defendant\u2019s financial condition cannot be a rational basis for determining whether punitive damages should be assessed in the first place, nor can it rationally be the sole basis for determining the amount of punitive damages. However, a defendant\u2019s financial condition is logically one of the essential factors to consider in determining an amount of punitive damages that will appropriately accomplish the goals of punishment and deterrence. A punitive sanction of $1,000.00 for reprehensible conduct may be sufficient to deter an individual of modest means from subsequently engaging in similar conduct, while that sanction could be utterly ineffective to deter an individual with vast financial resources from engaging in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>same conduct. Similarly, a punitive sanction of $1,000.00 may constitute a significant level of punishment for an individual of modest means, but it could amount to an inconsequential penalty for an individual with vast financial resources.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Conversely, a $100,000.00 punitive sanction may sufficiently punish and deter a wealthy individual who has engaged in reprehensible conduct; yet, if that same sanction would bankrupt an individual of modest means who has engaged in the same conduct, it could therefore constitute an excessive penalty.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-4\">\u00b6133 As the California Supreme Court has observed, in conjunction with its holding that \u201cthe defendant\u2019s financial condition is an essential factor in fixing an amount\u201d that serves the goals of punitive damages:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-5\">Obviously, the function of deterrence will not be served if the wealth of the defendant allows him to absorb the award with little or no discomfort. Punitive damage awards should not be a routine cost of doing business that an industry can simply pass on to its customers through price increases, while continuing the conduct the law proscribes. On the other hand, the purpose of punitive damages is not served by financially destroying a defendant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AKO\"><em>Simon v. San Paolo U.S. Holding Co., Inc., </em>113 P.3d 63, 78-79 (Cal. 2005) (citations, internal quotation marks, and alterations omitted).<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AV4\">\u00b6134  The purpose of a punitive damages verdict is to have an impact on the defendant in the form of punishment and deterrence. <em>Campbell, </em>538 U.S. at 416, 123 S.Ct. at 1519. Without knowledge of the defendant\u2019s financial condition, the jury cannot know what impact any particular punitive damages verdict will have. Needless to say, this would seriously hinder the jury\u2019s ability to tailor a punitive verdict to a particular defendant. In this scenario, speculation regarding the defendant\u2019s financial condition would be required to determine an amount of punitive damages that would appropriately punish and provide a sufficient deterrent effect. Engaging in such speculation, a jury might make erroneous assumptions based on evidence at trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>that may or may not have any relation to the defendant\u2019s actual financial condition. And, believing that the defendant has vast financial resources, the jury might render a substantial punitive verdict when in fact the defendant is of modest means and would be appropriately punished and sufficiently deterred by a relatively minor penalty. Indeed, in some punitive damages cases the defendants have complained to this Court that evidence of their financial condition was <em>not </em>presented at trial, thus emphasizing the fact that such evidence actually serves to protect defendants from unnecessarily high awards by allowing the jury to know what impact a particular punitive award will have on the defendant\u2019s finances. <em>See Cartwright v. Equitable Life Assurance, </em>276 Mont. 1, 37, 914 P.2d 976, 998 (1996); <em>Gurnsey v. Conklin Co., Inc., </em>230 Mont. 42, 54-55, 751 P.2d 151, 158 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b298-4\">\u00b6135 While Defendants here disapprove of the fact that evidence of a tortfeasor\u2019s financial condition can lead to large punitive verdicts, they apparently do not recognize the critical role that such evidence plays in <em>constraining </em>punitive verdicts. As we have observed, a defendant\u2019s financial condition may be the primary reason <em>precluding </em>a substantial punitive damages verdict. <em>Cartwright, </em>276 Mont. at 44, 914 P.2d at 1002. Nonetheless, the Defendants here would have juries render punitive damages verdicts without reference to the specific financial impact on the culpable party. The speculation that would be engendered by this approach would create a substantial risk of unjust results in the form of punitive damages verdicts that are either inappropriately small or unjustifiably large. As such, the logic and practicality of considering the defendant\u2019s financial condition is clearly evident-it is, in fact, the only way to make an informed decision which ensures that the punitive damages award is properly tailored so as not to be too harsh or too lenient.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">\u00b6136  We see nothing in <em>Campbell </em>that invalidates \u00a7 27-l-221(7)(a), MCA. The California Supreme Court has reached the same conclusion, determining that subsequent to the <em>Campbell </em>decision \u201cthe defendant\u2019s financial condition remains a legitimate consideration in setting punitive damages.\u201d <em>Simon, </em>113 P.3d at 79 (citing <em>Campbell, </em>538 U.S. at 427-28, 123 S.Ct. at 1525, for its statement that consideration of a defendant\u2019s wealth is not unlawful or inappropriate). Accordingly, we reject the Defendants\u2019 argument and hold that the District Court did not err by admitting evidence of the Defendants\u2019 financial condition during the punitive damages proceedings and instructing the jury to consider that evidence in determining the amount of punitive damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>\u00b6137 (8) Is GDC entitled to judgment as a matter of law on the punitive damages verdict?</p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">\u00b6138 GDC argues that it is entitled to judgment as a matter of law on the punitive damages verdict because Seltzer failed to present evidence sufficient to demonstrate that GDC could be held hable for Gladwell\u2019s actions. In support of this argument, GDC asserts that Seltzer failed to demonstrate that a GDC managing partner knew of Gladwell\u2019s allegedly malicious conduct and intended to ratify it.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Yet, GDC does not dispute that it was properly held liable for compensatory damages based on the conduct of its attorneys.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-6\">\u00b6139 GDC designated Gladwell as its corporate representative at trial. Accordingly, the District Court instructed the jury that GDC \u201chas authorized Dennis Gladwell to testify on its behalf, and thus, the testimony of Dennis Gladwell is the testimony of Defendant Gibson, Dunn &amp; Crutcher, LLP.\u201d During the settling of instructions, GDC expressly stated to the District Court that it had no objection to this instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-7\">\u00b6 140 Gladwell testified that because he occupied \u201cof counsel\u201d status with GDC, as a former partner, the firm\u2019s internal policy required him to obtain approval from a GDC partner to file suit against Seltzer. Gladwell then testified that he obtained approval from GDC partner William Claster to file the suit under the banner of GDC. Yet, Gladwell also testified that while he technically occupied \u201cof counsel\u201d status, he \u201cwas still acting in the capacity of a partner.\u201d Additionally, in accordance with the Defendants\u2019 insistence at trial that the suit against Seltzer was proper, Gladwell freely admitted that GDC \u201ctotally approved all of [his] conduct\u201d prior to the filing of the Complaint and up to the dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-8\">\u00b6141 Seltzer presented the \u201cNew Matter Memorandum\u201d which GDC generated, in accordance with its internal protocol, in initiating the suit against Seltzer. This document explicitly states that William Claster, as a GDC partner, was the \u201cpartner in charge\u201d of the case and that he approved the \u201cengagement.\u201d It also specifies Erin Alexander as a GDC attorney assigned to work on the case and states that the firm intended to seek \u201can injunction and damages\u201d against Seltzer. Further, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>this document indicates that GDC conducted a review of its records to ensure that no conflicts of interest existed.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-4\">\u00b6142 Seltzer also presented an email correspondence between Gladwell and Claster wherein Gladwell stated that the lawsuit would include, inter alia, a defamation claim, and that \u201call billing will be through the firm as per normal protocol.\u201d Gladwell also noted in the email that Erin Alexander would be assisting with the case. Further, Seltzer presented evidence that Jeffery Thomas, the managing partner of GDC\u2019s office in Irvine, California, knew of and was involved in the case. Not only did Gladwell testify that Thomas \u201cwas aware of the lawsuit,\u201d but Seltzer presented an email correspondence between Thomas and Erin Alexander wherein Thomas stated: \u201cthis is a regular firm case, despite Dennis\u2019 [i.e., Dennis Gladwell\u2019s] involvement. My secretary has the currently pending letter; please come get it and send it out.\u201d Finally, Seltzer presented the Complaint GDC filed in the underlying suit, which lists William Claster, Erin Alexander, and Gladwell as GDC counsel of record in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">\u00b6143 All of the foregoing evidence was admitted at trial and went uncontroverted by GDC. As the District Court stated in its post-verdict order reviewing punitive damages, GDC \u201cpresented no evidence at trial that Dennis Gladwell was not its authorized agent at all times pertinent.\u201d Further, the evidence at trial was consistent with the District Court\u2019s conclusions, stated in its post-verdict order: (1) \u201cthe evidence established unequivocally that GD&amp;C, by and through William Claster, expressly authorized Gladwell to prosecute the underlying lawsuit against Seltzer on behalf of and under the colors of GD&amp;C\u201d; and (2) GDC \u201cby and through its authorized agents William Claster and Erin Alexander, also voluntarily provided substantial assistance or encouragement to Gladwell and Morton through the initial authorization by Mr. Claster, the litigation support of Erin Alexander, and the authorized use of the GD&amp;C corporate name, resources, and prestige.\u201d Notwithstanding this overwhelming and uncontroverted evidence, GDC now argues that Seltzer failed to present evidence sufficient to demonstrate that GDC could be held liable for Gladwell\u2019s actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-6\">\u00b6144 The District Court instructed the jury that in certain circumstances corporate entities are liable to third parties for wrongful acts committed by its agents or employees. The court further instructed the jury that GDC was liable for the actions of Gladwell and Erin Alexander. During the settling of instructions, the Defendants expressly stated to the court that they had no objection to these <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>particular instructions. \u201cWe have long adhered to the rule that an instruction given without an objection becomes the law of the case.\u201d <em>DeBruycker v. Guaranty Natl. Ins. Co., </em>266 Mont. 294, 301, 880 P.2d 819, 823 (1994) <em>(citing Nicholson v. United Pacific Ins. Co., </em>219 Mont. 32, 38, 710 P.2d 1342, 1346 (1985)) (internal quotation marks omitted). Thus, because GDC expressly acquiesced to the instruction which stated that the firm was liable for Gladwell\u2019s actions, that instruction became the law of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-4\">\u00b6 145 \u201c[T]he Due Process Clause prohibits a State from punishing an individual without first providing that individual with an opportunity to present every available defense.\u201d <em>Philip Morris USA v. Williams, </em>No. 05-1256, slip op. at 5 (U.S. Feb. 20, 2007) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). At trial, GDC had the opportunity to argue that it should not be held liable for the actions of its attorneys. However, GDC instead argued that the suit against Seltzer was proper and expressly acquiesced to the giving of an instruction that the firm was hable for the actions of its attorneys. As such, this Court will not now consider GDC\u2019s argument that Seltzer failed to present evidence sufficient to demonstrate that the firm could be held hable for Gladwell\u2019s actions because that contention contradicts the law of the case. Accordingly, we conclude that GDC is not entitled to judgment as a matter of law on the punitive damages verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">\u00b6146 (9) Did the District Court err in applying federal due process law to the jury\u2019s punitive damages award?</p>\n<p id=\"b301-7\">\u00b6147 As noted above, the jury assessed punitive damages in the amount of $100,000.00 against Morton, $150,000.00 against Gladwell, and $20 million against GDC. In reviewing the jury\u2019s assessments pursuant to federal due process law, the District Court concluded that the verdicts against Morton and Gladwell were not excessive, and that the verdict against GDC must be reduced to $9.9 million. Both Seltzer and GDC challenge the latter determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-8\">\u00b6148 The imposition of punitive damages has \u201c \u2018long been a part of traditional state tort law.\u2019 \u201d <em>Haslip, </em>499 U.S. at 15, 111 S.Ct. at 1041. \u201cPunitive damages may properly be imposed to further a State\u2019s legitimate interests in punishing unlawful conduct and deterring its <em>repetition.\u201d BMW of North America, Inc. v.

Ins. Co. v. Campbell, </em>538 U.S. 408, 416, 123 S.Ct. 1513, 1519 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b302-4\">\u00b6149  The states possess \u201cbroad discretion\u201d regarding the imposition of punitive damages. <em>Cooper Industries, Inc. v. Leatherman Tool Group, Inc., </em>532 U.S. 424, 433, 121 S.Ct. 1678, 1683 (2001). However, \u201cthere are procedural and substantive constitutional limitations on these awards. The Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment prohibits the imposition of grossly excessive or arbitrary punishments on a tortfeasor.\u201d <em>Campbell, </em>538 U.S. at 416, 123 S.Ct. at 1519-20 (internal citations omitted). When an award of punitive damages can fairly be categorized as \u201cgrossly excessive\u201d in relation to a state\u2019s interests in punishment and deterrence, it enters \u201cthe zone of arbitrariness that violates the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\u201d <em>Gore, </em>517 U.S. at 568, 116 S.Ct. at 1595. \u201cTo the extent an award is grossly excessive, it furthers no legitimate purpose and constitutes an arbitrary deprivation of property.\u201d <em>Campbell, </em>538 U.S. at 417, 123 S.Ct. at 1520.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-6\">\u00b6150 The exact meaning of the concept of \u201cgross excessiveness,\u201d as with the concepts of \u201creasonable suspicion\u201d and \u201cprobable cause,\u201d \u201ccannot be articulated with precision; they are \u2018fluid concepts that take their substantive content from the particular contexts in which the standards are being assessed.\u2019 \u201d <em>Cooper Industries, </em>532 U.S. at 436, 121 S.Ct. at 1685. Thus, as a substantive limit on the amount of punitive damages that may be imposed, \u201cthe relevant constitutional line is inherently imprecise, rather than one marked by a simple mathematical formula.\u201d <em>Cooper Industries, </em>532 U.S. at 434-35, 121 S.Ct. at 1684 (internal citations and quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b302-7\">\u00b6151  In determining whether that line has been crossed, we must consider three \u201cguideposts\u201d which the United States Supreme Court announced in Gore: (1) the degree of reprehensibility of the defendant\u2019s misconduct; (2) the disparity, or ratio, between the actual or potential harm suffered by the plaintiff and the punitive damages award; and (3) the difference between the punitive damages awarded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>by the jury and the civil penalties authorized or imposed in comparable cases. <em>Campbell, </em>538 U.S. at 418, 123 S.Ct. at 1520.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AAq\">\u00b6152 We must conduct de novo review of the District Court\u2019s application of the <em>Gore </em>guideposts to the jury\u2019s punitive damages verdict. <em>Cooper Industries, </em>532 U.S. at 436, 121 S.Ct. at 1685-86.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> As for the resolution of factual issues, we defer to the District Court\u2019s findings of fact unless they are clearly erroneous. <em>Cooper Industries, </em>532 U.S. at 440, n.14, 121 S.Ct. at 1688, n.14. Here, pursuant to \u00a7 27-l-221(7)(c), MCA, the District Court issued extensive and detailed findings of fact in reviewing the verdict. On appeal, no litigant argues that any of these findings are clearly erroneous. Thus, we defer to the District Court\u2019s factual findings, which are entirely consistent with the jury\u2019s verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-4\">\u00b6153 As for the application of federal due process jurisprudence, Seltzer argues that the <em>Gore </em>guideposts do not require reducing the jury\u2019s punitive verdict against GDC, while GDC argues these guideposts mandate that the punitive verdict not exceed the amount of compensatory damages. Before reaching the federal due process issue, however, we address several preliminary arguments and note relevant aspects of Montana law.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">Preliminary Arguments</p>\n<p id=\"b303-6\">\u00b6154  First, Seltzer argues that the Defendants have waived their opportunity to challenge the punitive damages verdict on federal constitutional grounds because they failed to raise this issue before the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>jury rendered its decision. In support of this argument, Seltzer cites <em>Jerome v. Jerome, </em>175 Mont. 429, 431, 574 P.2d 997, 998 (1978), wherein this Court stated: \u201cConstitutional issues are waived if not raised at the earliest opportunity.\u201d We do not find <em>Jerome </em>applicable here. As the Second Circuit Court of Appeals has noted, the propriety of the size of a punitive damages verdict is an issue that becomes ripe after the verdict is entered. <em>Local Union No. 38 v. Pelella, </em>350 F.3d 73, 89 (2nd Cir. 2003). Accordingly, a constitutional challenge regarding the size of a punitive verdict may be raised by way of post-verdict motion, just as the Defendants did here. Thus, we reject Seltzer\u2019s argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-4\">\u00b6155 Second, Seltzer contends that this Court should not review the jury\u2019s punitive damages verdict against GDC pursuant to the <em>Gore </em>guideposts. The record indicates that GDC maintains an insurance policy with Lloyd\u2019s of London which provides $160 million in coverage for punitive damages liability. As the substantive due process analysis is premised on an actual deprivation of property, Seltzer argues, that analysis is not applicable here because GDC\u2019s punitive damages insurance policy guarantees that the firm will not suffer any deprivation of its property.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-6\">\u00b6156 We note that the United States Supreme Court\u2019s due process jurisprudence in this area speaks of both the \u201cimposition\u201d of punitive damages and the \u201cdeprivation\u201d of property. <em>See Campbell, </em>538 U.S. at 416-17, 123 S.Ct. at 1519-20 (the Due Process Clause \u201cprohibits the <em>imposition </em>of grossly excessive or arbitrary punishments on a tortfeasor\u201d; \u201cThis constitutional concern, itself harkening back to the Magna Carta, arises out of the basic unfairness of <em>depriving </em>citizens of life, liberty, or property, through the application, not of law and legal processes, but of arbitrary coercion.\u201d) (emphases added) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b304-7\">\u00b6157 Seltzer cites no authority directly holding that punitive damages insurance coverage renders the due process analysis inapplicable. He does, however, analyze various United States Supreme Court precedents that can be read to support this conclusion. Seltzer\u2019s argument is not without merit, as there appears to be a legitimate distinction between the \u201cimposition\u201d of a punitive damages verdict and the \u201cdeprivation\u201d of property-i.e., where the defendant lacks insurance coverage for punitive damages, the imposition of a punitive damages sanction translates directly into a deprivation of property; conversely, as Seltzer appropriately observes, the defendant suffers no deprivation of property when its insurer covers the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>obligation to pay punitive damages. Yet, while it is true that GDC will not be deprived of its property i/Xloyd\u2019s of London covers the punitive damages obligation in this case, we cannot conclude that the absence of a \u201cdeprivation\u201d of property dispels the constitutional concern with the \u201cimposition\u201d of the punitive damages verdict against GDC. Because the United States Supreme Court\u2019s current jurisprudence appears to be equally concerned with the \u201cimposition\u201d of a punitive damages verdict and the \u201cdeprivation\u201d of property, we conclude that the <em>Gore </em>analysis is triggered whenever a punitive damages verdict is challenged as unconstitutionally excessive. Accordingly, until we are presented with persuasive arguments to the contrary, or until the Supreme Court holds otherwise, we will apply the due process guideposts of <em>Gore </em>despite the existence of punitive damages insurance.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-4\">\u00b6158 Finally, the Defendants\u2019 briefing focuses almost exclusively on the amount of punitive damages assessed against GDC, presenting virtually no argument regarding the amount of punitive damages assessed separately against Morton and Gladwell. Defendants simply claim that these latter two punitive verdicts are unconstitutionally excessive because Morton and Gladwell did not engage in violent conduct and because there is no evidence that they have previously engaged in conduct similar to that at issue here. Other than stating these two facts, which constitute only a minor portion of the circumstances here, the Defendants provide no analysis regarding <em>Gore\u2019s </em>reprehensibility guidepost. Moreover, Defendants utterly fail to address the other two <em>Gore </em>guideposts with respect to these two punitive verdicts. Although our review of a trial court\u2019s application of these guideposts is de novo, <em>Cooper Industries, </em>532 U.S. at 436, 121 S.Ct. at 1685-86, we only conduct that review when the issue is properly presented on appeal. We are not obligated to develop legal analysis that may lend support to a party\u2019s position. <em>In re Estate of Bayers, </em>1999 MT 154, \u00b6 19, 295 Mont. 89, \u00b6 19, 983 P.2d 339, \u00b6 19. Accordingly, because of the Defendants\u2019 failure to provide analysis in challenging the amount of the punitive damages verdicts against Morton and Gladwell, as is required by M. R. App. P. 23(a)(4), we will not consider the issue, <em>State v. Ferguson, </em>2005 MT 343, \u00b6 38, 330 Mont. 103, \u00b6 38, 126 P.3d 463, \u00b6 38, and we simply affirm those awards.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">Montana Statutory Framework</p>\n<p id=\"At6\">\u00b6159 As a final step before analyzing the <em>Gore </em>guideposts, we note aspects of Montana\u2019s legal framework which governed the trial in this case. Our statutory law addresses punitive damages claims in detail, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>providing both procedural and substantive requirements. For example, while a claim for compensatory damages must be proven by a preponderance of the evidence, <em>Holenstein v. Andrews, </em>166 Mont. 60, 64, 530 P.2d 476, 478 (1975), the standard of proof governing a claim for punitive damages is more stringent under our statutory law:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b306-4\">All elements of [a] claim for punitive damages must be proved by clear and convincing evidence. Clear and convincing evidence means evidence in which there is no serious or substantial doubt about the correctness of the conclusions drawn from the evidence. It is more than a preponderance of evidence but less than beyond a reasonable doubt.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">Section 27-1-221(5), MCA. <em>InHaslip, </em>the United States Supreme Court concluded that the Due Process Clause does not require that punitive damages claims be proven by a standard higher than \u201cpreponderance of the evidence,\u201d such as \u201cclear and convincing evidence\u201d or \u201cbeyond a reasonable <em>doubt.\u201d </em>Haslip, 499 U.S. at 23, n.11, 111 S.Ct. at 1046, n.11. Thus, Montana\u2019s standard of proof affords defendants with a level of protection that actually exceeds the federal constitutional requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"AUd\">\u00b6160 By statute, punitive damages may only be awarded \u201cwhen the defendant has been found guilty of actual fraud or actual malice.\u201d Section 27-1-221(1), MCA. Actual malice is statutorily defined as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b306-6\">A defendant is guilty of actual malice if the defendant has knowledge of facts or intentionally disregards facts that create a high probability of injury to the plaintiff and:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b306-7\">(a) deliberately proceeds to act in conscious or intentional disregard of the high probability of injury to the plaintiff; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b306-8\">(b) deliberately proceeds to act with indifference to the high probability of injury to the plaintiff.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b306-9\">Section 27-1-221(2), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-10\">\u00b6161 In the first phase of trial in this case, where the jury had to determine, inter alia, whether the Defendants should be held liable for punitive damages, the District Court explained the differing purposes of compensatory and punitive damages with the following instruction:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ak-\">In contrast to compensatory damages which have the purpose to compensate a plaintiff for actual injury or loss caused by a defendant\u2019s wrongful conduct, punitive damages are a remedy which has the purpose to punish a defendant for wrongful conduct, deter the defendant from similar wrongful conduct in the future, and deter others from engaging in similar conduct.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A3j\">Additionally, in accordance with the above statutory provisions, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>jury was instructed regarding the \u201cclear and convincing evidence\u201d standard of proof and the requirement to prove actual malice.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"Alm\">\u00b6162 In the second phase of trial, the District Court instructed the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b307-4\">You have previously determined that, in addition to compensatory damages for actual injury, the defendant is also liable for punitive damages for engaging in malicious conduct that resulted in actual damage to the plaintiff. Accordingly, you must now determine what amount, if any, is necessary to punish the defendant for the wrongful conduct, deter the defendant from similar wrongful conduct in the future, and deter others from engaging in similar conduct.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">The court then instructed the jury to consider, in assessing the amount of punitive damages, a number of factors, including the nature and extent of the Defendants\u2019 misconduct; the reprehensibility of this conduct; the Defendants\u2019 intent in engaging in the misconduct; the likelihood of recidivism; the Defendants\u2019 financial affairs, financial condition, and net worth; the total amount of compensatory damages previously awarded to Seltzer; any circumstances weighing in favor of reducing punitive damages; and \u201cwhether the amount of your punitive damage award is reasonably and fairly related to the nature, extent, and reprehensibility of the defendant\u2019s conduct.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b307-6\">\u00b6163 We note that these instructions are similar to those approved by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Haslip, </em>where the defendant challenged an Alabama punitive damages verdict which it characterized as \u201cthe product of unbridled jury discretion.\u201d Haslip, 499 U.S. at 7, 111 S.Ct. at 1037. The jury instructions in that case explained that the imposition of punitive damages was not compulsory; described \u201cthe purpose of punitive damages, namely, \u2018not to compensate the plaintiff for any injury\u2019 but \u2018to punish the defendant\u2019 and \u2018for the added purpose of protecting the public by [deterring] the defendant and others from doing such wrong in the future\u2019 \u201d; and directed the jury to \u201c \u2018take into consideration the character and the degree of the wrong as shown by the evidence.\u2019 \u201d <em>Haslip, </em>499 U.S. at 19, 111 S.Ct. at 1044 (alteration in original). The Supreme Court determined that \u201c[t]he jury was adequately instructed\u201d and stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>To be sure, the instructions gave the jury significant discretion in its determination of punitive damages. But that discretion was not unlimited. It was confined to deterrence and retribution, the state policy concerns sought to be advanced....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-4\">These instructions, we believe, reasonably accommodated [the defendant\u2019s] interest in rational decisionmaking and Alabama\u2019s interest in meaningful individualized assessment of appropriate deterrence and retribution. The discretion allowed under Alabama law in determining punitive damages is no greater than that pursued in many familiar areas of the law as, for example, deciding \u201cthe best interests of the child,\u201d or \u201creasonable care,\u201d or \u201cdue diligence,\u201d or appropriate compensation for pain and suffering or mental anguish. As long as the discretion is exercised within reasonable constraints, due process is satisfied.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b308-5\"><em>Haslip, </em>499 U.S. at 19-20, 23, 111 S.Ct. at 1044, 1046 (footnote omitted).<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b308-6\">\u00b6164 On appeal, the Defendants challenge only one portion of the instructions regarding punitive damages-the instruction that the jury consider Defendants\u2019 financial condition as a factor in fixing the amount. As we have noted above, Defendants\u2019 argument on that issue is incorrect as a matter of law. Thus, as the Defendants do not present any other procedural issues, we only undertake a substantive due process analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-7\">\u00b6165 As for judicial review at the trial court level, \u00a7 27-l-221(7)(c), MCA, provides that all jury awards of punitive damages must be reviewed by the trial judge prior to judgment. This statute allows the judge to adjust the punitive damages verdict and requires that he or she \u201cclearly state the reasons for increasing, decreasing, or not increasing or decreasing the punitive damages award of the jury in findings of fact and conclusions of law.\u201d Section 27-l-221(7)(c), MCA. In doing so, the judge must demonstrate consideration of each of the following factors:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-8\">(i) the nature and reprehensibility of the defendant\u2019s wrongdoing;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-9\">(ii) the extent of the defendant\u2019s wrongdoing;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-10\">(iii) the intent of the defendant in committing the wrong;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b309-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>(iv) the profitability of the defendant\u2019s wrongdoing, if applicable;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b309-4\">(v) the amount of actual damages awarded by the jury;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b309-5\">(vi) the defendant\u2019s net worth;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b309-6\">(vii) previous awards of punitive or exemplary damages against the defendant based upon the same wrongful act;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b309-7\">(viii) potential or prior criminal sanctions against the defendant based upon the same wrongful act; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b309-8\">(ix) any other circumstances that may operate to increase or reduce, without wholly defeating, punitive damages.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b309-9\">Section 27-l-221(7)(b), MCA.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> The United States Supreme Court has favorably cited this statute, indicating that judicial review pursuant to these factors \u201cimposes a sufficiently definite and meaningful constraint\u201d on punitive damages awards and provides a rational basis for determining \u201cwhether a particular award is greater them reasonably necessary to punish and deter.\u201d <em>Haslip, </em>499 U.S. at 22, 111 S.Ct. at 1045-46.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b309-10\">\u00b6166 We now turn to the <em>Gore </em>guideposts.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b310-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>Reprehensibility</p>\n<p id=\"b310-4\">\u00b6167 The first <em>Gore </em>guidepost requires that we assess the degree of reprehensibility of the defendant\u2019s misconduct. <em>Campbell, </em>538 U.S. at 418, 123 S.Ct. at 1520. As the United States Supreme Court has stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b310-5\">\u201c[T]he most important indicium of the reasonableness of a punitive damages award is the degree of reprehensibility of the defendant\u2019s conduct.\u201d We have instructed courts to determine the reprehensibility of a defendant by considering whether: the harm caused was physical as opposed to economic; the tortious conduct evinced an indifference to or a reckless disregard of the health or safety of others; the target of the conduct had financial vulnerability; the conduct involved repeated actions or was an isolated incident; and the harm was the result of intentional malice, trickery, or deceit, or mere accident. The existence of any one of these factors weighing in favor of a plaintiff may not be sufficient to sustain a punitive damages award; and the absence of all of them renders any award suspect.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b310-6\"><em>Campbell, </em>538 U.S. at 419, 123 S.Ct. at 1521 (internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b310-7\">\u00b6168 In considering these factors, we observe that the District Court\u2019s detailed post-verdict findings are consistent with the evidence presented at trial and the jury\u2019s verdict. The court found that clear and convincing evidence established the Defendants knew that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b310-8\">(1) a reasonable and legitimate question existed as to the authenticity of the subject painting;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b310-9\">(2) it was highly probable that Seltzer was correct in his opinion that the subject painting was not an authentic work of C. M. Russell;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b310-10\">(3) Seltzer had not knowingly published false statements \u201cwith the intent to defame the painting and the Mortons\u2019 reputation for honesty and fair dealing\u201d;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b310-11\">(4) Seltzer had not knowingly made a false claim that the painting was not an authentic Russell with the intent to impair the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>Mortons\u2019 ability to sell the painting;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b311-4\">(5) Seltzer had not knowingly made a false claim that the painting was not an authentic Russell with the intent to damage the Mortons\u2019 business relationship with the Coeur d\u2019Alene Art Auction, Christie\u2019s Auction House, or other auction houses;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b311-5\">(6) Seltzer had not recklessly or carelessly challenged the authenticity of the painting;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b311-6\">(7) Seltzer had not recklessly or carelessly refused \u201cto recant or withdraw his statements when presented with evidence that the signature on the painting was not\u201d a forgery; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b311-7\">(8) in rendering and standing by his opinion, Seltzer was not guilty of actual malice or actual fraud, as defined by \u00a7\u00a7 27-1-221(2) and 27-1-221(3), MCA.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b311-8\">\u00b6169 The court further found that the Defendants</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b311-9\">knew or intentionally disregarded the fact that, unless he immediately capitulated as contemplated, making such allegations against Seltzer in a lawsuit would cause him to suffer emotional distress, damage his professional and personal reputation, and cause him to incur substantial defense costs. Notwithstanding, for the sole purpose of furthering their own ulterior purpose of forcing Seltzer to publicly recant his opinion and admit error to facilitate Morton\u2019s financial gain, Defendants deliberately proceeded to commence and prosecute the underlying lawsuit in conscious or intentional disregard or indifference to the high probability of causing Seltzer to suffer emotional distress, damage to his professional reputation for competence and honesty, damage to his personal reputation for honesty, and to incur substantial defense costs.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b311-10\">As evidenced by Dennis Gladwell\u2019s trial testimony, Defendants not only were aware of these consequences to Seltzer, they arrogantly counted on them to intimidate Seltzer into a quick and tidy \u201csettlement\u201d that would essentially require him to: (1) completely capitulate by publicly recanting his opinion; (2) admitting error or incompetence; (3) pay Morton the difference between the actual selling price of the painting and his original profit expectancy contemplated prior to Seltzer\u2019s opinion; and (4) pay Morton an additional $50,000 for his trouble in stifling Seltzer\u2019s opinion. Defendants assumed and counted on the fact that Seltzer most likely was of relatively insignificant means and was therefore financially vulnerable and susceptible to such intimidation. Defendants blatantly and maliciously tried to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>intimidate Seltzer with the apparent power, prestige, and resources of a large, nationally prominent law firm coupled with an ominous lawsuit that they knew threatened to ruin and devastate him professionally, personally, and financially.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b312-4\">\u00b6170 Additionally, the District Court found that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-5\">the manifest and acknowledged objective of the lawsuit was not to obtain an adjudication of the merits of the asserted claims, but rather to threaten Seltzer and force a negotiated retraction and disavowal of his opinion thereby enabling the Mortons to sell the painting at full market value as an authentic Russell.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b312-6\">In fact, the \u201cdisavowal\u201d GDC sought from Seltzer amounted to a pure misrepresentation of his professional opinion. As noted above, GDC literally demanded that Seltzer lie, under oath, about his true conviction by drafting \u201ca letter to our specifications completely recanting and withdrawing\u201d his statements under penalty of peijury. Further, this demand was made under threat of an immediate lawsuit in which GDC stated it would seek punitive damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-7\">\u00b6171 After the malicious lawsuit was filed, GDC made matters even worse by abusing the discovery process, thereby undermining Seltzer\u2019s ability to defend himself. As the District Court found, GDC abused discovery when it \u201cintentionally withheld certain non-privileged correspondence generated by the Mortons\u2019 former attorney, Joshua Rievman, including the March 14,2001, correspondence from Rievman to the Kennedy Galleries containing key admissions against interest by the Mortons.\u201d That letter stated, inter alia: \u201cthe Mortons have been shocked to learn that the painting is not a work by Russell.... The Mortons consider Kennedy Galleries\u2019 fraudulent (or, at the very least, negligent) misrepresentations to be an extremely serious matter and intend to hold Kennedy Galleries liable for the damages they have suffered.\u201d GDC also withheld Morton\u2019s letter to Ginger Renner wherein he expressed his \u201cstate of shock\u201d upon learning her opinion of the painting\u2019s authenticity, and requested that she provide him a letter formally expressing her professional opinion in order to help him determine a course of action. The District Court found:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-8\">Defendants concealed damaging admissions by Morton to Ginger Renner and, through counsel (Rievman), to the Kennedy Galleries. These admissions were extremely damaging to Defendants\u2019 asserted position because they showed that Defendants were well aware from the outset that the painting was probably not an authentic Russell and that Seltzer was not trying to maliciously damage the Mortons by knowingly and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>maliciously making false statements about the authenticity of the painting.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b313-4\">The District Court also found that the letter from Morton to Renner was unquestionably relevant to \u201cthe heart of the claims and defenses at issue\u201d in the underlying action against Seltzer. The <em>Gore </em>decision notes that \u201cconcealment of evidence of improper motive\u201d may be taken into consideration when assessing the reprehensibility of a defendant\u2019s conduct. <em>Gore, </em>517 U.S. at 579, 116 S.Ct. at 1601. Thus, we note that GDC amplified the reprehensibility of its conduct by concealing evidence relevant to the motives underlying the suit against Seltzer. And all of this behavior was conducted, in part, pursuant to GDC\u2019s purported representation of Frank Morton, who had not authorized GDC to file suit on his behalf, and had not even communicated with Gladwell or any other member of GDC prior to the instigation of the lawsuit. Further, while the Defendant\u2019s were still seeking damages from Seltzer in the underlying suit pursuant to their allegation that he had \u201cfalsely claimed that the painting is not authentic,\u201d GDC was at the same time demanding that the Amon Carter Museum and the Kennedy Galleries \u201cprovide the Mortons with an authentic C. M. Russell\u201d in exchange for \u201cLassoing a Longhorn.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">\u00b6172 Finally, as for the harm caused to Seltzer, the District Court found that the Defendants\u2019 misconduct \u201ccaused Seltzer to needlessly suffer severe emotional distress for approximately 9 months, suffer significant physical complications as a result of emotional distress, suffer serious damage to his personal and professional reputation, and incur substantial defense costs.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b313-6\">\u00b6173 We conclude that Gore\u2019s reprehensibility factors indicate GDC\u2019s conduct was highly reprehensible. This conduct evinced an indifference to and a reckless disregard of Seltzer\u2019s financial, psychological, and physical wellbeing, as well as his personal and professional reputation. None of the conduct at issue was accidental; GDC acted with actual malice, as found by the jury, and GDC does not contest that finding. As a direct result of GDC\u2019s malicious conduct, Seltzer suffered severe emotional distress which resulted in debilitating physical trauma; he suffered serious damage to his impeccable personal and professional reputation which he had built up over his lifetime; and he incurred over $45,000.00 in attorney fees in defending himself for nearly seven months. While the record does not contain extensive evidence regarding Seltzer\u2019s financial means, it does demonstrate that he was in a position of relative financial vulnerability. It is established that an adverse compensatory damages award of roughly $700,000.00, as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>sought in the underlying Complaint, would have forced Seltzer into bankruptcy. Additionally, while he was able to hire counsel to defend himself, Seltzer lacked the funds to pay his attorney\u2019s hourly fee at that time. As the District Court found, Seltzer had a \u201crelative lack of resources to defend himself.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b314-4\">\u00b6174 Several additional factors must be taken into account: (1) as the District Court found, there is no evidence that GDC\u2019s misconduct was driven by \u201cany significant profit motive, other than to remain in favorable standing with Steve Morton, a prominent client of the firm\u201d; (2) the wrongdoing at issue is a single episode of damaging misconduct, rather than repeated instances;<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> and (3) there is no evidence that GDC has previously engaged in such misconduct. However, these factors do not reduce the high level of reprehensibility already established by the other aspects of GDC\u2019s misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">\u00b6175  Abusive conduct toward an individual which causes the type of harm at issue here merits considerable punishment regardless of the setting in which it takes place. However, the fact that GDC utilized the judicial system as a tool to accomplish intimidation and oppression makes this behavior uniquely egregious. As the District Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b314-7\">Although no less damaging, it may have been less reprehensible if a legal layman had devised and attempted to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>execute this scheme. However, it is even more reprehensible that a highly experienced trial attorney [of GDC] not only condoned this conduct, but in fact devised it, recommended it to the lay client, and aggressively prosecuted it on the client\u2019s behalf. As embodied in the Rules of Professional Conduct, lawyers have a special and essential professional responsibility to vigilantly safeguard against abusive litigation practices that impair or defeat the administration of justice rather than facilitate it. At its core, this case involved an extremely abusive, malicious, and oppressive litigation practice devised and executed by a prominent and experienced lawyer who had a professional gate-keeping duty to know better and discourage such abuses.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AVZ\">\u00b6176 The goal of every trial is \u201ca search for the truth.\u201d <em>Finstad v. W.R.

Montana\u2019s approach to such perversions of judicial process is demonstrated, inter alia, in our jurisprudence dealing with discovery abuse.

Indeed, litigants who force courts to expend judicial resources dealing with discovery abuse \u201cin this era of crowded dockets ... deprive other litigants of an opportunity to use the courts as a serious dispute-settlement mechanism.\u201d <em>Richardson, </em>\u00b6 57 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).

Pardis, </em>240 Mont. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>187, 193, 783 P.2d 919, 923 (1989), and in other cases, the imposition of default judgment on the issue of liability, see <em>Richardson, </em>\u00b6 69; <em>Culbertson Health Care Corp. v. JP Stevens &amp; Co., </em>2005 MT 254, \u00b6 21, 329 Mont. 38, \u00b6 21, 122 P.3d 431, \u00b6 21; <em>Schuff v. A.T.

Indeed, our concerns are even more acute with respect to baseless and malicious lawsuits.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-4\">\u00b6179 At oral argument, counsel for GDC attempted to minimize the reprehensibility of the firm\u2019s conduct by arguing that litigation is a common occurrence and the \u201cessence of the system\u201d is to reach a verdict on the merits. Among other things, counsel argued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-5\">Clients bring demands letters to me every day ... and sometimes they settle, sometimes they say: \u201cBring it on. In a court of law you\u2019re going to lose.\u201d ... I believe that, in court, ya know, \u201cbring it on\u201d-if they\u2019ve got a good lawsuit, a jury will find one way, if they don\u2019t, a jury will find the other way. And that\u2019s the essence of the system.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b316-6\">We take exception to this notion. The \u201cessence\u201d of our judicial system is not simply the resolution of disputes; rather, it is the resolution of <em>legitimate </em>disputes. Baseless lawsuits prosecuted in furtherance of ulterior motives have no place in our courts. Moreover, the sort of saber-rattling, chest-thumping approach typified by the comment of GDC\u2019s counsel, trivializes the devastating effects on the health, reputations, and fortunes of the real people who are maliciously and abusively sued. For the ordinary citizens who are the victims of such a lawsuit, it may be the most horrific experience of their lives. Indeed, those effects are not merely the collateral damage of some run-of-the-mill litigation battle between attorneys. Rather, the defendants in such cases are the innocent casualties of the war. That is why the \u201cessence of the system\u201d with respect to such lawsuits is to provide recourse for the victim and levy punishment against the perpetrator by way of actions for abuse of process and malicious prosecution. Thus, the \u201cessence of the system\u201d was evident in the instant suit by Seltzer\u2019s recovery of compensatory damages and the jury\u2019s assessment of a severe punitive sanction against GDC.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-7\">\u00b6180  In short, GDC\u2019s use of the judicial system amounts to legal thuggery. This behavior is truly repugnant to Montana\u2019s foundational notions of justice and is therefore highly reprehensible. Thus, in accordance with Montana\u2019s legitimate interest in punishment and deterrence, we conclude that a particularly severe sanction comports <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>with due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-4\">Ratio</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">\u00b6181 The second <em>Gore </em>guidepost requires us to consider the disparity, or ratio, between the actual or potential harm suffered by the plaintiff and the punitive damages award. <em>Campbell, </em>538 U.S. at 418, 123 S.Ct. at 1520. The United States Supreme Court has steadfastly refused to establish a bright-line ratio in defining due process constraints on punitive damages. The <em>Gore </em>decision states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AGP\">Of course, we have consistently rejected the notion that the constitutional line is marked by a simple mathematical formula, even one that compares actual and potential damages to the punitive award.... [We] reiterate our rejection of a categorical approach. Once again, \u201cwe return to what we said in <em>Haslip: </em>\u201cWe need not, and indeed we cannot, draw a mathematical bright line between the constitutionally acceptable and the constitutionally unacceptable that would fit every case. We can say, however, that a general concern of reasonableness properly enters into the constitutional calculus.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b317-6\"><em>Gore, </em>517 U.S. at 582-83, 116 S.Ct. at 1602 (internal footnote, alterations, and citation omitted); <em>see also Campbell, </em>538 U.S. at 425, 123 S.Ct. at 1524 (\u201cWe decline again to impose a bright-line ratio which a punitive damages award cannot exceed.\u201d).<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"ASs\">\u00b6182 Although \u201cthere are no rigid benchmarks that a punitive damages award may not surpass,\u201d <em>Campbell, </em>538 U.S. at 425, 123 S.Ct. at 1524, some general guidelines inform the analysis under the ratio guidepost. In <em>Campbell, </em>the Supreme Court stated that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-7\">in practice, few awards exceeding a single-digit ratio between punitive and compensatory damages, to a significant degree, will satisfy due process.... Single-digit multipliers are more likely to comport with due process, while still achieving the State\u2019s goals of deterrence and retribution, than awards with ratios in range of 500 to 1, [as in <em>Gore], </em>or, [as in <em>Campbell], </em>of 145 to 1.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b318-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number><em>Campbell, </em>538 U.S. at 425, 123 S.Ct. at 1524.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> In <em>Gore, </em>the Supreme Court stated that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-4\">low awards of compensatory damages may properly support a higher ratio than high compensatory awards, if, for example, a particularly egregious act has resulted in only a small amount of economic damages. A higher ratio may also be justified in cases in which the injury is hard to detect or the monetary value of noneconomic harm might have been difficult to determine.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b318-5\"><em>Gore, </em>517 U.S. at 582, 116 S.Ct. at 1602. <em>Campbell </em>reiterated these statements from <em>Gore, </em>but further stated: \u201cThe converse is also true, however. When compensatory damages are substantial, then a lesser ratio, perhaps only equal to compensatory damages, can reach the outermost limit of the due process guarantee.\u201d <em>Campbell, </em>538 U.S. at 425, 123 S.Ct. at 1524. <em>Campbell </em>then stated the overriding principle: \u201cThe precise award in any case, of course, must be based upon the facts and circumstances of the defendant\u2019s conduct and the harm to the plaintiff.\u201d <em>Campbell, </em>538 U.S. at 425, 123 S.Ct. at 1524.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-6\">\u00b6183 The subtleties in these ratio guidelines require us to examine the Supreme Court\u2019s statements closely. The statement that \u201c[s]ingle-digit multipliers are more likely to comport with due process,\u201d being rather imprecise by itself, is brought into sharper focus by the statement that \u201cfew awards exceeding a single-digit ratio between punitive and compensatory damages, to a significant degree, will satisfy due process.\u201d <em>Campbell, </em>538 U.S. at 425, 123 S.Ct. at 1524. The qualifying language \u201cfew awards\u201d and \u201cto a significant degree\u201d appear to provide important guidance. The plain terms of these statements, taken together, indicate that while double-digit ratios are often less likely to comport with due process, they can be appropriate if they do not exceed single-digit ratios \u201cto a significant degree\u201d; and even when the ratio exceeds single digits to \u201ca significant degree,\u201d it may yet constitute one of the \u201cfew\u201d double-digit ratios that nonetheless comports with due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-7\">\u00b6184 While the two aforementioned statements discuss ratios exclusively, other statements by the Supreme Court discuss ratios with specific reference to the amount of compensatory damages awarded. As noted above, \u201clow awards of compensatory damages may properly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>support a higher ratio than high compensatory awards,\u201d<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> <em>Gore, </em>517 U.S. at 582, 116 S.Ct. at 1602; and conversely, \u201c[w]hen compensatory damages are substantial, then a lesser ratio, perhaps only equal to compensatory damages, can reach the outermost limit of the due process guarantee,\u201d <em>Campbell, </em>538 U.S. at 425, 123 S.Ct. at 1524. Consistent with the Supreme Court\u2019s refusal to establish rigid benchmarks, these statements provide guidance rather than a specific mandate-i.e., in the same way that low compensatory awards \u201cmay\u201d justify higher ratios, smaller ratios \u201ccan\u201d reach the outermost limits of due process when the compensatory award is substantial. In other words, it appears that low compensatory awards may, but do not necessarily, justify higher ratios;<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> and in the same way, substantial compensatory awards may, but do not necessarily, require lower ratios. Thus, we reject GDC\u2019s assertion that \u201ca 9:1 ratio is in almost all cases the constitutional limit.\u201d This assertion simply contradicts the Supreme Court\u2019s statements regarding <em>Gore\u2019s </em>ratio guidepost.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-4\">\u00b6185 The principle that substantial compensatory damages do not always require low single-digit ratios is born out in recent caselaw. In <em>Campbell, </em>the plaintiffs brought a bad faith action against State Farm which resulted in a $1 million compensatory damages award and a $145 million punitive damages verdict. <em>Campbell, </em>538 U.S. at 414-15, 123 S.Ct. at 1518-19. In reversing the Utah Supreme Court\u2019s decision to uphold the punitive damages verdict, the United States Supreme Court concluded, inter alia, that the ratio of 145:1 was presumptively <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>inappropriate given the facts of the case.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> <em>Campbell, </em>538 U.S. at 426, 123 S.Ct. at 1524.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-4\">\u00b6186 In remanding to the Utah Supreme Court, the United States Supreme Court stated that, in light of the \u201csubstantial\u201d compensatory damages awarded, the <em>Gore </em>guideposts \u201clikely would justify a punitive damages award at or near the amount of compensatory damages.\u201d <em>Campbell, </em>538 U.S. at 429, 123 S.Ct. at 1526. On remand, the Utah Supreme Court took a different view, instead reducing the punitive damages award to approximately $9.02 million. <em>Campbell v. State Farm Mutual Auto. Ins. Co., </em>98 P.3d 409, 410 (Utah 2004). In interpreting <em>Campbell, </em>538 U.S. 408, 123 S.Ct. 1513, the Utah Supreme Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-5\">The 1-to-l ratio between compensatory and punitive damages is most applicable where a sizeable compensatory damages award for economic injury is coupled with conduct of unremarkable reprehensibility. This scenario ... does not describe this case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-6\">... Simply put, the trial court\u2019s determination that State Farm caused the Campbells $1 million of emotional distress warrants condemnation in the upper single-digit ratio range rather than the 1-to-l ratio urged by State Farm.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-7\">In sum, the Supreme Court affirmed the authority of a state to \u201cmake its own reasoned judgment about what conduct is permitted or proscribed within its borders.\u201d <em>Campbell II, </em>538 U.S. at 422, 123 S.Ct. 1513 (citing <em>Gore, </em>517 U.S. at 569, 116 S.Ct. 1589). It follows, therefore, that each state retains the right and the responsibility to draw on its own values and traditions when assessing the reprehensibility of tortious conduct for the purpose of reviewing the propriety of a punitive damages award, so long as that review conforms to the <em>Gore </em>guidelines and the demands of due process. To the extent that our conclusions about what size punitive damages award best serves the legitimate interests of Utah exceeds an award suggested by the Supreme Court, we are exercising what we interpret to be a clear grant of discretion to do so.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b320-8\"><em>Campbell, </em>98 P.3d at 418-19.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>\u00b6187 State Farm, having interpreted <em>Campbell\u2019s </em>ratio language as categorical rules rather than guidelines, again appealed to the United States Supreme Court, asserting that the Utah Supreme Court had \u201cegregiously disregarded\u201d the Supreme Court\u2019s guidance, and argued: \u201cReversal of the Utah Supreme Court\u2019s decision is essential to ensure that [the Supreme] Court\u2019s guidance is heeded by the lower courts.\u201d<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> The United States Supreme Court declined to review the case again. <em>State Farm Mutual Auto. Ins. Co. v. Campbell, </em>543 U.S. 874, 125 S.Ct. 114 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b321-4\">\u00b6188 Consistent with the Utah Supreme Court\u2019s view, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals has recognized that Campbell\u2019s reference to a 1:1 ratio does not establish a categorical rule in favor of a 1:1 ratio where compensatory damages are substantial. The Court in Hangarter <em>v. Provident Life &amp; Accident Ins. Co., </em>373 F.3d 998, 1003, 1014 (9th Cir. 2004), declined to impose a 1:1 ratio as requested by the defendants, and instead upheld the punitive damages award of $5 million together with compensatory damages of $2,670,849.00. In doing so, the Court noted that the United States Supreme Court has consistently rejected any simple mathematical formula or bright-line ratio as controlling in the constitutional inquiry, and further stated: <em>\u201c\\Campbell\u2019s\\ </em>1:1 compensatory to punitive damages ratio is not binding, no matter how factually similar the cases may <em>he.\u201d Hangarter, </em>373 F.3d at 1014-15. As do the Utah Supreme Court and the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, we recognize the flexible nature of <em>Gore\u2019s </em>ratio guidelines. At the same time, however, we acknowledge that <em>Campbell </em>stands for the general proposition that lower ratios are often more likely to comport with due process where compensatory damages are \u201csubstantial.\u201d <em>Campbell, </em>538 U.S. at 425, 123 S.Ct. at 1524.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">\u00b6189 Here, the jury\u2019s punitive damages verdict of $20 million against GDC, which represents approximately 7.7% of the firm\u2019s net worth of $260 million<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> and approximately 3.1% of the firm\u2019s 2003 gross revenues of $645,325,506.00, yields a ratio of approximately 18.2:1. We first consider whether this ratio exceeds single-digit ratios \u201cto a significant degree.\u201d <em>Campbell, </em>538 U.S. at 425, 123 S.Ct. at 1524. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>While it seems clear that ratios such as 12:1 and 15:1 do not exceed single digits \u201cto a significant degree,\u201d it is equally clear that a ratio of 100:1 does so. Given that the Supreme Court\u2019s remark regarding excess \u201cto a significant degree\u201d and its statement that \u201c[s]ingle-digit multipliers are more likely to comport with due process\u201d were both coupled with a reference to excessive ratios of 500:1 and 145:1, <em>Campbell, </em>538 U.S. at 425, 123 S.Ct. at 1524, we conclude that a ratio of 18:1 does not exceed single digits \u201cto a significant degree.\u201d However, that does not end our analysis. We must take into account the size of the compensatory damages awarded by the jury. The compensatory damages of $1.1 million awarded in this case can fairly be characterized as \u201csubstantial,\u201d as was the compensatory award of $1 million in <em>Campbell. Campbell, </em>538 U.S. at 426, 123 S.Ct. at 1524. Thus, it appears that a single-digit ratio, although not compulsory, is more likely to comport with due process.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b322-4\">Comparable Penalties</p>\n<p id=\"b322-5\">\u00b6190 The third <em>Gore </em>guidepost requires us to consider the difference between the punitive damages awarded by the jury and the civil penalties authorized or imposed in comparable cases. <em>Campbell, </em>538 U.S. at 418, 123 S.Ct. at 1520. The Supreme Court has stated that \u201ca reviewing court engaged in determining whether an award of punitive damages is excessive should accord substantial deference to legislative judgments concerning appropriate sanctions for the conduct at issue.\u201d <em>Gore, </em>517 U.S. at 583, 116 S.Ct. at 1603 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b322-6\">\u00b6191 Despite mandating this \u201csubstantial deference\u201d to legislative judgments, the Supreme Court has also indicated that far greater disparities are acceptable here than are acceptable under <em>Gore\u2019s </em>ratio guidepost. In <em>Campbell, </em>the Supreme Court noted that a $10,000.00 fine for fraud was the \u201cmost relevant civil sanction\u201d for the conduct at issue, and then proceeded to endorse (but not mandate) a punitive damages award of $1 million. <em>Campbell, </em>538 U.S. at 428-29, 123 S.Ct. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>at 1526. Thus, while the 145:1 ratio between punitive and compensatory damages ultimately did not comport with due process in that case, a 100:1 ratio between an appropriate punitive sanction and the most relevant legislatively established civil penalty was not inappropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-4\">\u00b6192 In addition to considering civil penalties, it is also appropriate to consider potential criminal penalties for the conduct at issue because these indicate the seriousness with which a state views the wrongful conduct. <em>Campbell, </em>538 U.S. at 428, 123 S.Ct. at 1526. However, such consideration must be limited by the principle that civil process may not be used to assess criminal penalties. <em>Campbell, </em>538 U.S. at 428, 123 S.Ct. at 1526.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">\u00b6193 Serious criminal penalties exist in Montana for the conduct at issue here. For example, a person<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> commits the offense of Deceptive Practices when the person purposely or knowingly \u201cdirects another to make a false or deceptive statement addressed to the public or any person for the purpose of promoting ... the sale of property.\u201d Section 45-6-317(l)(b), MCA. Additionally, a person commits the offense of Solicitation \u201cwhen, with the purpose that an offense [here Deceptive Practices] be committed, he commands, encourages, or facilitates the commission of that offense.\u201d Section 45-4-101(1), MCA. In this case, both offenses would have been felonies, \u00a7 45-2-101(23), MCA, because the value of the painting exceeded and would have been sold-as a bogus Russell-for in excess of $1,000.00. Both offenses would have been punishable by a fine of up to $50,000.00 or imprisonment in the state prison for a term of up to 10 years, or both. Sections 45-6-317(2), 45-4-101(2), MCA. While our analysis under the third <em>Gore </em>guidepost cannot be guided to any great extent by this criminal sanction, we take note that Montana\u2019s public policy, as expressed by the Legislature, evinces a grave concern with misconduct of the kind involved in this case. Our conclusion under <em>Gore\u2019s </em>reprehensibility guidepost, that a particularly severe sanction for GDC\u2019s highly reprehensible conduct comports with due process, is consistent with this grave concern embodied in Montana\u2019s public policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-6\">\u00b6194 As noted above, the Montana Legislature has limited punitive damages awards by enacting \u00a7 27-1-220(3), MCA, which provides: \u201cAn award for punitive damages may not exceed $10 million or <em>3% </em>of a defendant\u2019s net worth, whichever is less. This subsection does not limit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>punitive damages that maybe awarded in class action lawsuits.\u201d As we have concluded, this statutory cap does not apply to the punitive damages verdict in this case because it went into effect after Seltzer\u2019s cause of action accrued. Additionally, this statute does not establish a civil penalty for any particular conduct. Thus, it is inappropriate for this Court to treat \u00a7 27-1-220(3), MCA, with the \u201csubstantial deference\u201d required for statutes that enunciate a relevant legislative judgment \u201cconcerning appropriate sanctions for the conduct at issue.\u201d <em>See </em>Gore, 517 U.S. at 583, <em>116 </em>S.Ct. at 1603. However, \u00a7 27-1-220(3), MCA, does represent a legislative judgment regarding penalties in civil cases generally, and thus warrants our consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-4\">\u00b6195 Direct application of the statutory cap in this case would limit punitive damages against GDC to $7.8 million.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> The jury\u2019s punitive damages verdict exceeds that amount by $12.2 million. Because strict compliance with legislatively established civil penalties is not mandated in this due process analysis, and because the statutory cap is of minimal relevance here, the third <em>Gore </em>guidepost provides only a minimal indication that this verdict may exceed due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-6\">Summary</p>\n<p id=\"b324-7\">\u00b6196 Because federal due process jurisprudence compels us to render a decision that interferes with the jury\u2019s verdict, we pause here to clarify the nature of our de novo review in this case. It may appear that our analysis is an exercise in second-guessing the jury\u2019s punitive damages verdict-a verdict which the District Court characterized as a \u201creasoned and dispassionate judgment\u201d-and supplanting it with one of our own choosing. However, we stress that our task on appeal is not to determine what amount of punishment we would have assessed against GDC had we been members of the jury. Indeed, given the jury\u2019s traditional task of assessing punitive damages and this Court\u2019s well-established deference to jury verdicts, we conduct our review with a good deal of caution. Moreover, we have no doubt that the jury was motivated solely by a rational concern with punishment and deterrence, and we reject GDC\u2019s conclusory assertions to the contrary. However, we are required to apply the <em>Gore </em>guideposts de novo to determine whether the verdict has exceeded the outermost limit of due process. In other words, we are not assessing a penalty of our own choosing; rather, we are ascertaining the boundary of due process.</p>\n<p id=\"AjJ\">\u00b6197 The reprehensibility guidepost indicates that a particularly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>severe punishment comports with due process. The ratio guidepost indicates that a single-digit ratio between punitive and compensatory damages is more likely to comport with due process than the 18:1 ratio yielded by the jury\u2019s verdict. The comparable penalties guidepost provides a minimal indication that an award near the statutory cap would likely comport with due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-4\">\u00b6198 We place primary emphasis on the reprehensibility guidepost because <em>Campbell </em>states that the \u201cmost important indicium of the reasonableness of a punitive damages award is the degree of reprehensibility of the defendant\u2019s conduct.\u201d <em>Campbell, </em>538 U.S. at 419, 123 S.Ct. at 1521. Considering the ratio guidepost in light of the need for a particularly severe punishment in order to serve Montana\u2019s legitimate interest in punishment and deterrence, as established under the reprehensibility guidepost, it becomes clear that only the highest single-digit multiplier would be appropriate. But for the facts that GDC does not have a history of this kind of misconduct and its conduct was not driven by a significant profit motive, a double-digit multiplier would undoubtedly comport with due process. Finally, to the minimal extent that the comparable penalties guidepost suggests reduction of the punitive verdict to a level near the statutory cap, that limited indication is relatively consistent with the indications we find under the previous two guideposts.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">\u00b6199  Accordingly, we conclude, as did the District Court, that the <em>Gore </em>guideposts provide for a punitive sanction of not more than $9.9 million in this case. This penalty adequately serves Montana\u2019s interest in punishment and deterrence, thereby protecting its citizens and preserving the integrity of the judicial system, while comporting with the constraints of due process. Thus, the District Court did not err in applying federal due process law to the jury\u2019s punitive damages verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-7\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b325-8\">\u00b6200 We affirm the District Court in all respects.</p>\n<judges id=\"b325-9\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES WARNER, COTTER, MORRIS, RICE and DISTRICT JUDGE BROWN, sitting for JUSTICE LEAPHART concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b254-5\"> Both are now deceased, Russell having passed away in 1926, and O.

In reality, the jury rendered a $150,000.00 punitive sanction against Gladwell and $20,250,000.00 in total punitive damages. We do not believe these misstatements were made intentionally, but we admonish appellate counsel to observe that most minimal of briefing requirements-i.e., correctly reciting the facts, particularly the facts central to the appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b271-6\"> While the <em>Brault </em>decision indicates at one point that an abuse of process entails the use of process to coerce another to perform a \u201ccollateral\u201d act, it also indicates, at the outset of the discussion regarding abuse of process, that the two <em>essential </em>elements of the tort of abuse of process are an ulterior purpose and a use of process which is both willful and improper. <em>Brault, </em>209 Mont. at 28-29, 679 P.2d at 240.

Williams, </em>No. 05-1256 (U.S. Feb. 20, 2007). That decision does not provide any new guidance as to how the <em>Gore </em>guideposts must be applied Rather, <em>Williams </em>holds that, as a matter of procedural due process, a State may not \u201cuse a punitive damages award to punish a defendant for injury that it inflicts upon nonparties or those whom they directly represent, <em>i.e., </em>injury that it inflicts upon those who are, essentially, strangers to the litigation.\u201d <em>Williams, </em>slip op. at 5. Although Philip Morris raised a question of substantive due process in challenging the amount of the punitive damages verdict rendered against it, the Supreme Court explicitly declined to address that issue. <em>Williams, </em>slip op. at 5. In the instant appeal, as noted above, we only address the matter of substantive due process-i.e., we must apply the <em>Gore </em>guideposts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>to determine whether the amount of the punitive damages verdict is constitutionally excessive. <em>Williams </em>provides no directives for that task. Additionally, while this appeal involves conduct that has two distinct aspects-i.e., the malicious actions directed at Seltzer, and GDC\u2019s flagrant affront to the judicial system-no issue is raised nor was any evidence admitted as to whether this conduct harmed nonparties. The jury did not punish GDC for harm to nonparties. Thus, we do not rely on <em>Williams </em>in our analysis of the punitive damages verdict in this case, and we therefore need not order supplemental briefing from the parties regarding that case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"26\">\n<p id=\"b314-8\"> Because recidivism is an important factor in the reprehensibility analysis, <em>Gore, 517 </em>U.S. at 577, 116 S.Ct at 1599-1600; <em>Campbell, </em>538 U.S. at 419, 123 S.Ct. at 1521, and because some of GDC\u2019s misconduct in the instant action replicates that committed in the underlying suit against Seltzer, we clarify the proper scope of our analysis. Consistent with its tactics in the underlying suit, GDC has, in the instant suit, continued to disregard fundamental litigation rules and basic principles of professional conduct. For example, GDC blatantly misrepresented an important fact in one of its motions filed with the District Court. Specifically, GDC asserted that none of the Defendants were aware of Ginger Renner\u2019s opinion regarding the authenticity of the painting when they filed suit against Seltzer. However, the evidence at trial in this case demonstrated that, prior to the instigation of the suit against Seltzer, Renner had expressed her professional opinion in a letter to Morton, GDC had obtained the letter, and Gladwell had read it. Additionally, as noted above, GDC abused the discovery process in the instant action when it concealed two documents that the District Court subsequently found to be \u201chighly relevant.\u201d As noted above, the District Court found that GDC\u2019s non-disclosure \u201cimpaired Seltzer\u2019s ability to depose key witnesses ... [and] impaired his ability to meaningfully follow up and investigate.\u201d Further, GDC abused discovery when Seltzer\u2019s counsel traveled to Irvine, California to conduct depositions. As the District Court found: (1) GDC impeded fair discover by interjecting a \u201chigh number of obstreperous and excessive objections and interruptions\u201d; and (2) \u201cthe last minute designation of Mr. Gladwell as [GDC\u2019s] corporate representative with the knowledge that he was then on a plane or in transit, but certainly not available locally at the cite of the California deposition, was obstructive and manipulative, in violation of the rules of discovery.\u201d GDC was sanctioned for its abuses of discovery in this case and has not appealed those sanctions. In our reprehensibility analysis here, we do not consider GDC\u2019s aforementioned misconduct in the instant action. Although recidivism is an important consideration in the reprehensibility analysis, the subject of this case is only the conduct that occurred before Seltzer filed suit against the Defendants.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"27\">\n<p id=\"b317-8\"> On remand following the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Gore, </em>the Alabama Supreme Court explained the problem with a bright-line ratio:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-9\">Although it is difficult to determine case by case what ratio of punitive damages to compensatory damages is excessive, we reject the easy answer of adopting one ratio that would apply to all and would therefore give a wrongdoer <em>precise </em>notice of the penalty that his misconduct might incur. To do so would frustrate the purpose of punitive damages, which is to punish and deter a defendant\u2019s misconduct.
