William Leaphart</author>\n<p id=\"ABA\">delivered the Opinion of the Court. \u00b6 1 Plaintiffs Swank Enterprises, Inc. (Swank) and St. Paul Insurance Company (St. Paul) filed a declaratory action seeking affirmation that defendant Continental Western Insurance Company (Continental) had a duty to defend Swank and was thus liable for the settlement paid to the City of Libby on Swank\u2019s behalf by St. Paul. Continental denied the allegation, claiming that the policy\u2019s provisions excluded coverage for Swank, an additional insured. The District Court, concluding that the policy did provide coverage for Swank, entered summary judgment against Continental for the settlement amount plus attorney fees. We affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"A9F\">\u00b62 Continental raises three issues on direct appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b222-8\">\u00b63 I.

Did the District Court err by holding Continental liable for the entire settlement amount, as opposed to a pro-rated amount with St. Paul?</p>\n<p id=\"b222-11\">\u00b66 Additionally, Swank raises the following issue on cross-appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"A0C\">\u00b67 IV. Did the District Court err by not awarding prejudgment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>interest?</p>\n<p id=\"b223-4\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">\u00b68 In November of 1996, Swank and the City of Libby entered into a contract for the construction of a water treatment plant. Swank subsequently entered into a subcontract with All Purpose Services (All Purpose) to paint the filter tanks and pipes at the treatment plant. The contract between Swank and All Purpose called for All Purpose to designate Swank as an additional insured on All Purpose\u2019s commercial general liability insurance. Continental provided this insurance to All Purpose under two policies, both of which listed Swank as an additional insured. One policy was in effect from January 25,1997 to January 25,1998 (the 1997 policy), and the second was in effect from January 25, 1998 to January 25, 1999 (the 1998 policy).</p>\n<p id=\"b223-6\">\u00b69 All Purpose selected the paint and painted the tanks and pipes from December 1997 to early February 1998. After All Purpose finished the job it was discovered that All Purpose had used an improper type of paint. The treatment plant\u2019s tanks and pipes were stripped and repainted and the treatment plant was shut down for the duration of the repair work. The City of Libby consequently sued Swank for the costs associated with repainting the pipes, alleging that: (1) Swank, as the general contractor, acted negligently by failing to properly coordinate the work of All Purpose, by not ensuring that All Purpose was using the correct type of paint and by not stopping All Purpose\u2019s work; and (2) Swank was vicariously liable for All Purpose\u2019s negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-7\">\u00b610 Swank tendered defense of the City of Libby\u2019s claim to Continental based on Swank\u2019s status as an additional insured and made a demand upon Continental for indemnity. Continental refused to defend or indemnify Swank, citing to exclusions (j), (k), (1), and (m) of its policy with All Purpose as support for its position that the policy did not provide coverage to Swank for the City of Libby\u2019s claim. Swank then tendered the City of Libby\u2019s claim its own insurer, St. Paul. St. Paul reached a settlement with the City of Libby, and issued a payment of $120,102.42 to the City of Libby on December 7, 2000. St. Paul issued an additional and final payment to the City of Libby for $27,899.35 on December 21,2000, for a total settlement of $148,001.77.</p>\n<p id=\"A3U\">\u00b611 Swank and St. Paul then brought a declaratory action against Continental and a claim seeking indemnification against All Purpose. Continental initially defended its position that no coverage existed based strictly on the exclusions contained in the 1997 policy. In fact, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>when Swank requested a copy of the applicable policy, Continental provided it with a copy of the 1997 policy. However, by the time Continental submitted its summary judgment motion and accompanying brief it was no longer relying on the terms of the 1997 policy, but on the 1998 policy, and was implicitly arguing that the 1998 policy applied and that the exclusions in that policy precluded coverage for the City of Libby\u2019s claims against Swank. Swank responded that, because the improper paint was applied during the coverage period of the 1997 policy, that policy and its exclusions apply. Swank also argued that the exclusions in the 1997 policy apply only to the \u201cnamed insured,\u201d All Purpose, and not to Swank, as an \u201cadditional insured.\u201d The District Court agreed with Swank, and concluded that Continental is liable for the settlement amount as well as costs and attorney fees, but that prejudgment interest is not appropriate because the amount of liability was in controversy and therefore uncertain until the court entered judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-4\">\u00b612 Continental appeals the District Court\u2019s grant of summary judgment for Swank and Swank cross-appeals the court\u2019s denial of prejudgment interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b224-6\">\u00b613 We review a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment <em>de novo. Montana Mountain Products v. Curl, </em>2005 MT 102, \u00b6 8, 327 Mont. 7, \u00b6 8, 112 P.3d 979, \u00b6 8 (citations omitted). The district court must decide whether there exists any genuine issue of material fact. If none exists, the district court must then decide whether to grant the motion as a matter of law. <em>Montana Mountain Products, </em>\u00b6 8 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b224-7\">\u00b614 We review a district court\u2019s decision to grant or deny an award of prejudgment interest to determine if the District Court\u2019s interpretation of the law is correct. <em>Ramsey v. Yellowstone Neurological Assocs., </em>2005 MT 317, \u00b6 18, 329 Mont. 489, \u00b6 18, 125 P.3d 1091, \u00b6 18 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b224-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b224-9\">\u00b615 I. Did the District Court err in concluding that the 1997 policy was the applicable policy?</p>\n<p id=\"b224-10\">\u00b616  The 1997 policy, by its terms, only applies to \u201cproperty damage\u201d that occurred during the policy period. The 1997 policy defines \u201cproperty damage\u201d as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-11\">a. Physical injury to tangible property, including all resulting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>loss of use of the property. All such loss of use shall be deemed to occur at the time of the physical injury that caused it; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-4\">b. Loss of use of tangible property that is not physically injured. All such loss of use shall be deemed to occur at the time of the \u201coccurrence\u201d that caused it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">All parties agree that the \u201closs of use\u201d of the treatment plant occurred after the 1997 policy expired. The question, then, is whether the selection and application of paint to the pipes and tanks by All Purpose, which did occur dining the 1997 policy period, constituted \u201cphysical injury to tangible property.\u201d We conclude that the application of improper paint did cause \u201cphysical injury\u201d to the pipes and tanks. The 1997 policy thus applies to all damage suffered by the City of Libby because the resulting loss of use is \u201cdeemed to occur at the time of the physical injury that caused it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">\u00b617 Continental, citing to <em>Endo Laboratories, Inc. v. Hartford Ins. Group, </em>747 F.2d 1264, 1268 (9th Cir. 1984), argues \u201cthat the time of the occurrence of an accident within the meaning of an indemnity policy is not the time the wrongful act was committed, but the time when the complaining party was actually damaged.\u201d While Continental agrees that the paint was applied during the 1997 policy period, it categorizes the application of the improper paint as the \u201cinjury-producing act, not the injury itself.\u201d The City of Libby was therefore not \u201cactually damaged,\u201d according to Continental, until the plant was shutdown for repainting, after the 1997 policy period.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-7\">\u00b618  Although our case law is sparse on the subject of what, exactly, constitutes \u201cphysical injury\u201d in the context of a commercial general liability insurance contract, we did consider the issue in <em>Lindsay Drilling &amp; Contracting v. U.S. Fidelity &amp; Guarantee Co., </em>208 Mont. 91, 676 P.2d 203 (1984). There we considered, among other issues, whether \u201csalting\u201d of core samples with gold constituted \u201cphysical injury\u201d under a definition of \u201cproperty damage\u201d that read: \u201cphysical injury to or destruction of tangible property ....\u201d <em>Lindsay Drilling, </em>208 Mont. at 95, 676 P.2d at 205. We concluded that the core samples had been \u201cphysically injured\u201d because \u201c[t]hey were physically and materially altered when they were salted with gold. That alteration resulted in a detriment <em>....\u2019\u2019Lindsay Drilling, </em>208 Mont. at 96, 676 P.2d at 206. Applying this rationale, we now hold that the term \u201cphysical injury\u201d refers to a physical and material alteration resulting in a detriment.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-8\">\u00b619 Here, the application of improper paint during the 1997 policy period caused \u201cphysical injury\u201d because it physically and materially <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>altered the treatment center\u2019s tanks and pipes, resulting in a detriment to the City of Libby. The detriment in fact was that the pipes and tanks had to be stripped and repainted. However, even if the City of Libby had taken no action (that is, even if the treatment plant had not been shut down and repainted), the City still would have been damaged because the paint would not have sufficiently protected the pipes and tanks. As with the \u201csalted\u201d core samples in <em>Lindsay Drilling, </em>the application of improper paint reduced the value of the pipes and tanks to the City of Libby.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-4\">\u00b620 Additionally, the fact that the discovery or diagnosis of the problem did not occur until after the 1997 policy period is of no consequence. A \u201cphysical injury can occur \u201ceven though the injury is not \u2018diagnosable,\u2019 \u2018compensable,\u2019 or manifest during the policy period as long as it can be determined, even retroactively, that some injury did occur during the policy period.\u201d <em>In re Silicone Implant Litigation, </em>667 N.W.2d 405, 415 (Minn. 2003) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">\u00b621  We hold, therefore, that the 1997 policy applies to the City of Libby\u2019s claims against Swank because the application of improper paint to the treatment center\u2019s pipes and tanks by All Purpose during the 1997 policy period constituted \u201cproperty damage.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b226-6\">\u00b622 II. Did the District court err in concluding that the policy exclusions, all of which addressed the \u201cnamed insured,\u201d did not apply to Swank, an \u201cadditional insured?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b226-7\">\u00b623 Exclusions (j), (k), (1) and (m), which Continental asserts preclude coverage for the City of Libby\u2019s claims against Swank, all address \u201cyou\u201d or \u201cyour.\u201d The 1997 policy defines \u201cyou\u201d and \u201cyour\u201d as referring to the \u201cNamed Insured,\u201d All Purpose. The exclusions at issue thus only directly refer to All Purpose. The exclusions apply to \u201cproperty damage\u201d arising out of All Purpose\u2019s operations and \u201cproperty damage\u201d to All Purpose\u2019s \u201cproduct.\u201d The exclusions, therefore, if applicable, would preclude coverage for damage due to All Purpose\u2019s botched paint job.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-8\">\u00b624 The policy lists Swank as an additional insured, and provides coverage to Swank for \u201cliability arising out of [All Purpose\u2019s] operations performed for [Swank].\u201d The policy also contains a \u201cseverability of interests\u201d clause entitled \u201cSeparation of Insureds.\u201d This clause provides that the policy applies \u201c[separately to each insured against whom claim is made or \u2018suit\u2019 is brought.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b226-9\">\u00b625 Swank contends, and the District Court agreed, that the \u201cseverability of interests\u201d clause acts to provide All Purpose, as the named insured, and Swank, as the additional insured, with separate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>coverage, as if each were separately insured with a distinct policy. As the exclusions only reference the \u201cnamed insured,\u201d they do not apply to Swank as an \u201cadditional insured.\u201d The only restriction on Swank\u2019s coverage, Swank claims, is that the liability \u201carise out of\u2019 AH Purpose\u2019s operations for Swank.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-4\">\u00b626 Continental counters that, while the exclusions do refer to A11 Purpose and A11 Purpose\u2019s work, they also exclude Swank\u2019s claims that arise from A11 Purpose\u2019s work because the exclusions apply to all claims alleging the described \u201cproperty damage,\u201d regardless of who is seeking coverage. Continental would have no reason to include exclusions relating to Swank\u2019s own work, because Swank\u2019s own work is outside the scope of coverage. According to Continental, Swank is entitled to fuU coverage, as a separate insured, but not to extra coverage excluded under the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">\u00b627 We are bound to interpret the terms of an insurance contract according to their usual, common-sense meaning as viewed from the perspective of a reasonable consumer of insurance products. <em>Wendell v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., </em>1999 MT 17, \u00b6 14, 293 Mont. 140, \u00b6 14, 974 P.2d 623, \u00b6 14 (citations omitted). Further, exclusions from coverage wiU be narrowly and strictly construed because they are contrary to the fundamental protective purpose of an insurance policy. <em>Marie Deonier &amp; Assoc. v. Paul Revere Life Ins. Co., </em>2000 MT 238, \u00b6 45, 301 Mont. 347, \u00b6 45, 9 P.3d 622, \u00b6 45 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">\u00b628 The language of the exclusions at issue is clear and the reference pronouns are defined in the policy. The exclusions clearly refer to \u201cproperty damage\u201d arising out of <em>All Purpose\u2019s </em>operations and \u201cproperty damage\u201d to <em>All Purpose\u2019s </em>\u201cproduct.\u201d The exclusions do not reference Swank. When strictly construed based on their plain language, the exclusions at issue do not exclude claims made by Swank, especially when considered in light of the severability of interests clause. On the other hand, the exclusion section is prefaced by the language \u201c[t]his insurance does not apply to\u201d with the fist of exclusions following, which can be read to exclude coverage to <em>any </em>insured when the underlying damage triggers the exclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-7\">\u00b629 The exclusions at issue, therefore, can be read two ways: either the exclusions only apply to AH Purpose, since they specificaUy reference the named insured, or the exclusions arise from the actions of the named insured but apply to any insured seeking coverage. In other words, the language of the exclusions is ambiguous. An ambiguity exists when the contract taken as a whole in its wording or phraseology is reasonably subject to two different interpretations. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number><em>Wendell, </em>\u00b6 14 (citations omitted). Ambiguities in the language of the contract will be construed against the insurer. <em>Wendell, </em>\u00b6 14 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b228-4\">\u00b630 As further evidence of ambiguity, we need only consider the amended endorsement to the 1998 policy, entitled \u201cAdditional Insureds,\u201d which expressly provides, unlike the 1997 policy, that \u201call exclusions\u201d apply to \u201cadditional insureds.\u201d Logic dictates one of two reasons for the change. Continental changed the policy so that the exclusions referring to \u201cyou\u201d and \u201cyour\u201d would also apply to additional insureds, which implies that the exclusions did not apply to additional insureds under the 1997 policy, or Continental sought to clarify that the exclusions apply to additional insureds, which indicates that the 1997 policy was ambiguous.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">\u00b631 We conclude, therefore, that the 1997 policy, in regards to the exclusions at issue, is at best ambiguous. Keeping in mind that exclusions are to be narrowly construed, we uphold the District Court\u2019s determination that the exclusions did not apply to Swank and the court\u2019s corresponding conclusion that Continental had a duty to defend the City of Libby\u2019s claim against Swank.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">\u00b632 III. Did the District Court err by holding Continental liable for the entire settlement amount, as opposed to a pro-rated amount with St. Paul?</p>\n<p id=\"b228-7\">\u00b633 Continental claims that the District Court should have pro-rated the settlement amount between Continental and St. Paul, Swank\u2019s primary insurer. Continental, citing to <em>Mountain West Ins. Co. v. Credit General Ins. Co, </em>247 Mont. 161, 163-64, 805 P.2d 569, 570-71 (1991), notes that when two insurance policies apply to the same loss, the \u201cother insurance\u201d policies should be examined to determine the proper allocation of the loss. Continental thus requests that this action be remanded for an allocation of the settlement.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-8\">\u00b634 Continental, however, did not directly raise this issue below. Continental only argued that, if coverage applied to Swank, Continental was an excess insurer (under the 1998 policy) and thus had no liability as St. Paul, the primary insurer, had fully covered the settlement within the limits of its policy. In fact, Swank, not Continental, came closest to raising the pro-rata issue by arguing, in its summary judgment reply brief, that, if the 1998 policy applied, both insurers should \u201cshare equally.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b228-9\">\u00b635 We have made it clear that a party\u2019s theory may not change on appeal, because it is fundamentally unfair to fault a district court for failing to rule correctly on an issue it never had the opportunity to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>consider. <em>State v. Johnson, </em>2005 MT 318, \u00b6 13, 329 Mont. 497, \u00b6 13, 125 P.3d 1096, \u00b6 13 (citations omitted). Although Continental addressed the larger issue of dual coverage, alleging that it was not liable for the settlement because St. Paul was the primary insurer, it failed to argue that liability should be pro-rated. Further, St. Paul\u2019s policy was not introduced into evidence. Consequently, since the District Court had neither the theory nor the evidence to rule on the issue, we decline to address it for the first time on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-3\">\u00b636 Even assuming the issue was raised, Continental would be estopped from denying full coverage for Swank\u2019s defense costs and judgment, including settlement, due to its unjustifiable failure to defend. <em>See Farmers Union Mut. Ins. Co. v. Staples, </em>2004 MT 108, \u00b6\u00b6 20-28, 321 Mont. 99, \u00b6\u00b6 20-28, 90 P.3d 381, \u00b6\u00b6 20-28.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-4\">\u00b637 IV. Did the District Court err hy not awarding prejudgment interest?</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">\u00b638 The District Court declined to award Swank and St. Paul prejudgment interest on the settlement amount paid to the City of Libby, reasoning that Swank\u2019s \u201centitlement\u201d to damages was \u201cjustifiably contested\u201d by Continental, and therefore Swank\u2019s right to recover was not certain and did not vest until the court granted summary judgment. Swank contends that, while liability was disputed, the amount was not and was made certain when St. Paul paid the second and final settlement payment.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">\u00b639 Section 27-1-211, MCA, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-7\">Every person who is entitled to recover damages certain or capable of being made certain ... and the right to recover [is vested] upon a particular day is entitled also to recover interest thereon from that day ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b229-8\">The three criteria which must be satisfied for an award of prejudgment interest are: (1) an underlying monetary obligation; (2) the amount of recovery must be certain or capable of being made certain by calculation; and (3) the right to recover must vest on a particular day. <em>Safeco Ins. Co. v. Lovely Agency, </em>215 Mont. 420, 424, 697 P.2d 1354, 1356 (1985) (citations omitted). However, \u201c[t]he fact that a claim is disputed does not make it uncertain,\u201d as long as the damage amount is reduced to certainty on a particular day. <em>Lovely, </em>215 Mont. at 425, 697 P.2d at 1357 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b229-9\">\u00b640  Here, the amount of the obligation has been certain since St. Paul paid the second and final settlement payment to the City of Libby. The fact that Continental disputed its liability to defend or insure Swank does not make the amount uncertain. The amount owed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>was reduced to a particular figure, $148,001.77, on December 21,2000, and Swank\u2019s right to recover correspondingly vested on that day. Swank and St. Paul are thus entitled to prejudgment interest on the settlement paid to the City of Libby.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-4\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">\u00b641 We affirm the District Court\u2019s determination that the 1997 policy is the applicable policy, that the exclusions in the 1997 policy do not apply to the City of Libby\u2019s claim against Swank, and that Continental is therefore liable to Swank and St. Paul for the settlement paid by St. Paul to the City of Libby on Swank\u2019s behalf.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">\u00b642 However, we reverse the District Court\u2019s denial of prejudgment interest, and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b230-7\">JUSTICES WARNER, RICE, NELSON and MORRIS concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
