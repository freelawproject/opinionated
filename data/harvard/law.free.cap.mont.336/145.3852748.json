Bitterroot is a Canadian corporation based in Missoula, and registered to conduct business in Montana. Western manufactures custom-built trucks and truck parts with its principal place of business in Kelowna, British Columbia. Western also is a Canadian corporation, but it is not registered to conduct business in Montana. Western contracted with Bitterroot, starting in the mid-1980s and continuing through the mid-1990s, to deliver freight from various locations around the United States to Western\u2019s headquarters in Kelowna, Canada.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-10\">\u00b68 Bitterroot proposed to Western in 1995 that Bitterroot perform transportation logistics services in addition to the freight hauling services that it previously had provided to Western. Bitterroot alleges that it submitted a written \u201cTransportation Logistics Proposal\u201d to Western that contained, among other things, a proposed contract term of five years, a plan to place a Bitterroot logistics employee at Western\u2019s headquarters, proposed hauling rates, and a performance evaluation method called a \u201creport card.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b171-11\">\u00b69 Western and Bitterroot signed a letter that had been written by Western, dated April 25,1996 (April 25 letter). Bitterroot alleges that the letter represented a contract between Western and Bitterroot to perform the logistics services that Bitterroot had proposed to Western in the 1995 \u201cTransportation Logistics Proposal.\u201d The April 25 letter referenced Bitterroot\u2019s \u201cTransportation Logistics Proposal,\u201d but also contained a number of terms not contained in Bitterroot\u2019s original logistics proposal. One of the new terms included a provision that allowed for either party to terminate the \u201cagreement\u201d with 120-days notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>\u00b610 Bitterroot began to implement the \u201cTransportation Logistics Proposal\u201d pursuant to the terms of the April 25 letter, while both parties continued to negotiate the \u201cdetails\u201d of the agreement. Bitterroot\u2019s actions in reliance on the April 25 letter included hiring, training, and placing a logistics employee at Western Star\u2019s facility in Canada and also installing computer equipment, telephone lines and a \u201cdata line,\u201d in order to provide Western with logistics services.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-4\">\u00b611 Western started to have second thoughts about its agreement with Bitterroot sometime around June of 1996. Western began to discuss logistics services with Logistics, Inc. (Logix), a competitor of Western. Logix, after reviewing Bitterroot\u2019s \u201cproposal,\u201d \u201cstrongly recommend[ed to Western] that no further action be taken on [Bitterroot\u2019s proposal].\u201d Western signed a formal agreement with Logix on April 13, 1997, for Logix to provide Western\u2019s logistics services.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">\u00b612 Logix immediately sent a letter to Bitterroot stating that \u201ceffective 4/15/1997 Logix has contracted with Western ... to manage all transportation and logistics issues.\u201d Bitterroot in turn notified Logix on April 21,1997, that Western and Bitterroot were operating under a \u201cbinding letter of intent\u201d and that \u201c[a]ny arrangement that Logix has with Western Star will have to encompass this agreement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b172-6\">\u00b613 Western then sent a letter to Bitterroot on June 11,1997, stating that Bitterroot and Western \u201chave been unable to conclude the details\u201d referenced in the April 25 letter, and \u201c[therefore Western Star is exercising the 120 day notice of termination, pursuant to the [April 25 letter], to terminate the relationship between Bitterroot and Western Star effective on October 17,1997.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b172-7\">\u00b614 Bitterroot objected in writing to Western\u2019s June 11, 1997 letter, requesting that \u201cWestern Star reconsider its position taken in your June 11, 1997 correspondence and recognized the obligations ... that arose at the time the April 25, 1996 letter of understanding was entered into.\u201d Western continued to communicate with Bitterroot in order to \u201cfinalize the details prior to the October 17,1997 [t]ermination date.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b172-8\">\u00b615 Bitterroot and Western negotiated past the October 17, 1997, termination date. Bitterroot\u2019s and Western\u2019s negotiations halted completely, however, on January 14, 1998, when Western informed Bitterroot that all of Western\u2019s logistics service would be handled exclusively by Logix, including the decision of whether Western would continue to use Bitterroot as a carrier. Bitterroot notified Western in February of 1998 that it was \u201cterminat[ing] all of its ongoing services to Western Star effective February 24, 1998 ... in light of Western <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>Star\u2019s refusal to honor its contractual obligations to Bitterroot....\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Aqq\">\u00b616 Bitterroot filed a complaint against Western in district court on March 13,1998, alleging breach of contract and breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing. Western filed a motion to dismiss on April 20,1998, pursuant to M. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(2) and (6), respectively. Western alleged that the comb did not have personal jurisdiction over Western and that Bitterroot had failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. The court ruled on September 2, 1999, that \u201cthe facts averred in the record indicate that both parties are transacting business in Montana.\u201d The court also noted, however, that Bitterroot was not registered to do business in Montana. The court ordered that Bitterroot could not maintain a proceeding in the courts of Montana pursuant to \u00a7 35-1-1027, MCA. The court stayed the action until Bitterroot filed proof of a certificate of authority to do business in Montana.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-3\">\u00b617 Bitterroot filed proof that it was properly registered to conduct business in Montana. The court then denied Western\u2019s motion to dismiss. The court cited the \u201ccontacts outlined in\u201d its September 2, 1999, order that had stayed the proceedings pending proof of Bitterroot\u2019s registration to conduct business in Montana.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-4\">\u00b618 Bitterroot amended its complaint on June 8, 2000, to include a claim against Logix for tortious interference with business relations. Bitterroot and Logix settled the claim, and the matter proceeded on Bitterroot\u2019s claims against Western.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-5\">\u00b619 Western moved for summary judgment on September 25, 2001, arguing that Bitterroot\u2019s claims must fail because no binding contract existed between the parties. The court denied the motion on the grounds that the evidence showed that \u201can agreement existed.\u201d The court concluded that \u201c[a]s Western Star Trucks\u2019 actions as well as its internal documents confirm the existence of an agreement between the parties for freight hauling at a set rate per mile over a five-year term, this Court finds sufficient evidence of an agreement between the parties, and a dispute as to material facts which prevents granting summary judgment to Western Star Trucks.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b173-6\">\u00b620 The District Court held a trial from May 20 through May 25,2005. The court instructed the jury that \u201ca contract was formed between the parties on April 25, 1996.\u201d The court submitted issues of breach and damages to the jury. The jury returned a verdict in favor of Bitterroot. The jury found that Western had breached the contract and the covenant of good faith and fair dealing. The jury awarded Bitterroot $2,311,575 in damages. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"A7l\">ISSUE ONE</p>\n<p id=\"b174-4\">\u00b621 <em>Was the District Court\u2019s decision to exercise personal jurisdiction over Western Star Trucks, Inc. correct?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b174-5\">\u00b622 The District Court determined that it had specific personal jurisdiction over Western based on the fact that Western was \u201ctransacting business within Montana.\u201d Western argues that the District Court had no basis to exercise specific personal jurisdiction over Western because Western is \u201ca Canadian corporation which lacks sufficient minimum contacts with Montana.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b174-6\">\u00b623 We review a district court\u2019s conclusion of law regarding personal jurisdiction to determine if it is correct. <em>Gulf. Ins. Co. v. Clark, </em>2003 MT 87, \u00b6 11, 315 Mont. 121, \u00b6 11, 68 P.3d 673, \u00b6 11. We review related findings of fact to determine whether the findings are clearly erroneous. <em>Gulf. Ins. Co., </em>\u00b6 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-7\">\u00b624 We conduct a two-step inquiry in order to determine whether a court can exercise personal jurisdiction over a non-resident defendant. <em>Boyd v. United Die And Manufacturing Co., </em>2004 MT 286, \u00b6 16, 323 Mont. 308, \u00b6 16, 100 P.3d 127, \u00b6 16. We determine first whether personal jurisdiction exists pursuant to M. R. Civ. P. 4B(1). <em>Boyd, </em>\u00b6 16. We determine second whether jurisdiction conforms with the traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice embodied in the Due Process Clause of the United States Constitution. <em>Boyd, </em>\u00b6 16.</p>\n<p id=\"Ab7\">\u00b625 Specific jurisdiction is established if the plaintiffs cause of action arises from any of the defendant\u2019s activities that are enumerated in M. R. Civ. P. 4B(1), including \u201c(a) the transaction of any business within this state....\u201d M. R. Civ. P. 4B(l)(a). The record indicates that Western transacted business in Montana, with a Montana based company, and a dispute arose out of those business transactions.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-8\">\u00b626  Western denies that Bitterroot and Western entered into a contract for transportation logistics in April of 1996, but Western does not dispute that Bitterroot performed a number of business activities in Montana pursuant to an informal agreement between Western and Bitterroot that began in April of 1996. Western, for example, does not challenge the fact that Bitterroot\u2019s employees, who were located in Missoula, performed a significant portion of the obligations required of Bitterroot pursuant to the terms of the April 25 letter. Western also does not challenge the fact that Bitterroot located one of its own employees, paid out of Bitterroot\u2019s office in Missoula, to Western\u2019s headquarters in Kelowna, British Columbia to perform obligations under the April 25 letter. Western agrees that Western and Bitterroot <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>communicated on a daily basis by telephone, fax, and through a \u201cdata line\u201d between Kelowna and Missoula that was used to provide services described in the \u201cTransportation Logistics Proposal.\u201d Western also does not dispute that Western made various payments to Bitterroot in Missoula. These facts are sufficient for the District Court to assert specific personal jurisdiction over Western pursuant to M. R. Civ. P. 4B(l)(a). <em>Boyd, </em>\u00b6 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-4\">\u00b627 We next determine whether the District Comb\u2019s exercise of jurisdiction comports with the traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice embodied in the Due Process Clause. <em>Boyd, </em>\u00b6 32. We presume jurisdiction is reasonable pursuant to the Due Process Clause once the plaintiff establishes that the defendant has purposefully availed itself of the privilege of conducting business in the forum. <em>Boyd, </em>\u00b6 34. We determine that a nonresident defendant has purposely availed itself of the forum when it \u201ctakes voluntary action designed to have an effect in the forum\u201d as opposed to contacts with the forum that are \u201crandom, fortuitous, attenuated, or due to the unilateral activity of a third party.\u201d <em>Boyd, </em>\u00b6 35.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">\u00b628 Western purposely availed itself of the privileges of conducting business in Montana by (1) hiring Bitterroot-a Montana-based company-to haul its freight and perform logistics services, (2) making payments to Bitterroot in Missoula, (3) hosting a Bitterroot employee at Western\u2019s headquarters who was paid by Bitterroot out of Missoula, and (4) communicating daily to and from Bitterroot\u2019s headquarters in Missoula via telephone, fax, and the specially installed \u201cdata line,\u201d pursuant to the April 25 letter. <em>Boyd, </em>\u00b6 35.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-6\">\u00b629  Western\u2019s present dispute with Bitterroot arose out of these activities. Western presents no compelling argument that the District Comb\u2019s exercise of jurisdiction was unreasonable. We presume that personal jurisdiction over Western is reasonable and conclude that the District Court\u2019s exercise of specific personal jurisdiction over Western does not offend traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice as embodied in the Due Process Clause. <em>Boyd, </em>\u00b6 35.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-7\">ISSUE TWO</p>\n<p id=\"b175-8\">\u00b630 <em>Did the District Court correctly determine that a five-year, written contract existed between the parties ?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b175-9\">\u00b631 The comb concluded in its October 2003 summary judgment order that \u2018Western Star Truck\u2019s actions as well as its internal documents confirm the existence of an agreement between the parties for freight hauling at a set rate per mile over a five year term....\u201d Western alleges <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>that the District Court erred in determining that a contract existed between the parties. Western argues that the parties did not mutually consent to the material terms of the alleged contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-4\">\u00b632 We review a district court\u2019s decision to grant summary judgment <em>de novo, </em>using the same criteria applied by the district court under M. R. Civ. P. 56. <em>GRB Farm v. Christman Ranch, Inc., </em>2005 MT 59, \u00b6 7, 326 Mont. 236, \u00b6 7, 108 P.3d 507, \u00b6 7. Summary judgment is appropriate when \u201cthe pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\u201d M. R. Civ. P. 56(c). We draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the party opposing summary judgment. <em>Watkins Trust v. Lacosta, </em>2004 MT 144, \u00b6 16, 321 Mont. 432, \u00b6 16, 92 P.3d 620, \u00b6 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-5\">\u00b633 Mutual consent consists of an offer and an acceptance of that offer. <em>Daniels v. Thomas, Dean &amp; Hoskins, Inc., </em>246 Mont. 125, 133, 804 P.2d 359, 363 (1990). We determine whether the parties have mutually consented to a contract by inquiring whether a reasonable person, based upon the objective manifestation of assent, and all the surrounding circumstances, would conclude that the parties intended to be bound by the contract. Sections 28-2-501, 503, MCA; <em>Lopez v. Charles Schwab &amp; Co., Inc., </em>118 Cal.App.4th 1224, 1229-30, 13 Cal.Rptr.3d 544, 548 (Cal.App. 1 Dist. 2004). We determine whether mutual consent exists based on the consent that the parties express through their words and the consent that the parties imply through their conduct. <em>Weinberg v. Farmers State Bank of Worden, </em>231 Mont. 10, 25, 752 P.2d 719, 728-29 (1988); Sections 28-2-103, 501, 503, MCA; Restatement (Second) of Contracts \u00a7\u00a7 4,19.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-6\">\u00b634 Our review of the record on summary judgment indicates that there is no genuine issue of material fact with regard to whether Western objectively manifested its intent to be bound to a contract with a five-year term and a set rate per mile on April 25, 1996. Western does not dispute that it wrote and signed the following letter:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AY8\">Date: April 25, 1996</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Af0\">Dear Stan:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-7\">This letter is your confirmation of acceptance by Western Star Trucks, in concept, of your Transportation Logistics Proposal.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ANX\">This also serves you notice to begin the procedure of obtaining a Logistics person and equipment required to perform the various functions required for this position.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-8\">The process within Western Star of an office realignment will also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>begin with your acceptance of these general terms: inclusive ofthe rates and terms in existence today, <em>\u201cincluding terms or limits\u201d </em>[hand written by Stan Spencer, either before or after he signed below]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b177-3\">Both Bitterroot and Western Star have a great deal at stake in our future work relationship, with this I can confidently say that I see no reason why we would not be able to finalize the details of this proposal. Should this not be the case, a 120 day notice in writing is required by either party to terminate this agreement. These details include rates, report card, and a job description for the Logistics person. Other minor items will include such things as, holiday relief, legal liabilities, decision making limitations, etc. Should this meet with your approval we would like to begin implementing this immediately, as Western Star would desire a start date of June 1, 1996.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b177-4\">THANKING YOU IN ADVANCE</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b177-5\">[signed] Paul Perreault [signed] Stan Spencer</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b177-6\">[Western Star] Traffic Specialist Bitterroot Acceptance</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ays\">Western admits that this document could be construed as an offer, but argues that the April 25 letter did not contemplate a five-year term or a rate schedule. Western does not point to any evidence, however, that refutes Bitterroot\u2019s deposition testimony that the parties understood that the term \u201cTransportation Logistics Proposal\u201d referred to a document that contained a five-year term and a rate schedule. Western, in fact, makes various admissions supporting Bitterroot\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-7\">\u00b635 Western admitted that it had received a \u201cTransportation Logistics Proposal\u201d from Bitterroot that contained a five-year term and set rates. Western also admitted that the April 25 letter \u201cexpressly accepts \u2018in concept\u2019 the unsolicited Transportation Logistics Proposals provided by Bitterroot to Western Star ....\u201d Western\u2019s own internal documents referenced the five-year term of the \u201cagreement\u201d and cited the same rates per mile contained in the \u201cTransportation Logistics Proposal.\u201d Western also admits in a March 7, 1996, internal document, entitled \u201cBitterroot Logistics Proposal,\u201d that the \u201c[c]ontract will be for a five (5) year term. (As per rate schedule).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b177-8\">\u00b636 We also find no genuine issue of material fact as to whether Bitterroot objectively manifested its intent to assent to the offer represented by Western\u2019s April 25 letter. Bitterroot presented evidence that it took the following actions in response to Western\u2019s April 25 letter: Bitterroot (1) signed the April 25 letter; (2) installed computer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>and telecommunications equipment, including a \u201cdata line;\u201d (3) hired, trained, and placed a full-time logistics employee at Western\u2019s headquarters; and (4) hauled freight according to the terms and rates contained in the \u201cTransportation Logistics Proposal\u201d for approximately two years after it had received the April 25 letter until Western cancelled the agreement. Western submitted no evidence to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-4\">\u00b637 Western argues in the alternative that its April 25 letter was ambiguous in light of the fact that the record contains two possible drafts of the \u201cTransportation Logistics Proposal:\u201d (1) the logistics proposal referenced in Bitterroot\u2019s complaint (\u201cfinal draft logistics proposal\u201d) that includes the five-year term and the rate schedule and (2) an earlier draft of the logistics proposal (\u201cinitial draft logistics proposal\u201d) that does not contain the five-year term or the rate schedule. Western asserts that no evidence in the record confirms that it ever had received the final draft logistics proposal, or that the final draft logistics proposal had been written by the time Western wrote the April 25 letter.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-5\">\u00b638 We first clarify the procedural contextinwhichWesternmakesits argument. Western moved for summary judgment in September of 2001 on the grounds that no contract existed between the parties. The court denied Western\u2019s motion for summary judgment in October2003, determining that there was \u201csufficient evidence of an agreement between the parties, and a dispute as to material facts which prevents granting summary judgment to Western Star Trucks.\u201d The court also appears to have granted partial summary judgment to Bitterroot, however, on the issue of contract formation. The court determined that \u201cWestern Star Trucks\u2019 actions as well as its internal documents confirm the existence of an agreement between the parties for freight hauling at a set rate per mile over a five-year term ....\u201d Although Bitterroot had not filed a cross-motion for partial summary judgment, a party need not file a formal cross-motion for summary judgment in order for a court to enter summary judgment in the non-moving party\u2019s favor where it is apparent that no genuine issues of material fact exist. <em>In re Estate of Marson, </em>2005 MT 222, \u00b6 9, 328 Mont. 348, \u00b6 9, 120 P.3d 382, \u00b6 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-6\">\u00b639 Western again raised the contract formation issue two years later at pretrial hearings on May 19 and 20, 2005 (pretrial hearings). Western argued at the pretrial hearings that the court should allow Western to argue to the jury that the term \u201cTransportation Logistics Proposal\u201d referenced the initial draft proposal and that no evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>demonstrated that Western had possessed the final draft proposal at the time that Western wrote the April 25 letter. The court determined that it would not allow evidence of the initial draft proposal to be presented to the jury. The court reminded Western\u2019s counsel that the court had determined in its summary judgment order of October 7, 2003, that <em>\u201ca </em>contract was found to exist\u201d and that the final draft logistics proposal was the controlling document.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-3\">\u00b640 We normally would review <em>de novo </em>the court\u2019s decision in the pretrial hearings to deny Western\u2019s motion for partial summary judgment on the existence of a contract between the parties. <em>GRB Farm, </em>\u00b6 7. We need not review the court\u2019s action here, however, as a denial of Western\u2019s motion for summary judgment. We conclude that the court could have denied Western\u2019s motion under the theory of judicial admission in light of the fact that Western\u2019s argument at the pretrial hearings directly contradicted the facts that it had admitted in the 2001 summary judgment proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-4\">\u00b641 A judicial admission is an express waiver made in court by a party or its counsel conceding the truth of an alleged fact. <em>In re Raymond W. George Trust, </em>1999 MT 223, \u00b6 36, 296 Mont. 56, \u00b6 36, 986 P.2d 427, \u00b6 36. A judicial admission has a conclusive effect upon the party who makes it, and prevents that party from introducing further evidence to prove, disprove, or contradict the admitted fact. <em>In re Raymond W.

Western also admitted that the April 25 letter \u201cexpressly accepts \u2018in concept\u2019 the unsolicited Transportation Logistics Proposals provided by Bitterroot to Western Star ....\u201d Western further clarified in a footnote that when it said, \u201cTransportation Logistics Proposals,\u201d it was referring to both the initial draft logistics proposal and the final draft logistics proposal. Western\u2019s admissions are confirmed by the District Court\u2019s statement in its 2003 summary judgment order that Western and Bitterroot did not contest that \u201cBitterroot forwarded a proposal to Western Star Trucks to provide logistics services in May, 1995, which included the statement \u2018Contract will be for a five (5) year term.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b179-6\">\u00b643 Western\u2019s admissions in the 2001 summary judgment proceedings directly contradict its arguments on appeal, and at the pre-trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>hearings, that there was no evidence that it ever had received the final draft logistics proposal and that the April 25 letter referred only to the initial draft proposal. Western admitted that it had received the final draft proposal and that the April 25 letter referred, at the very least, to both drafts of the proposal. We may uphold a district court that reached the right result even if for the wrong reason. <em>Pumphrey v. Empire Lath and Plaster, </em>2006 MT 99, \u00b6 37, 332 Mont. 116, \u00b6 37, 135 P.3d 797, \u00b6 37. We uphold the District Court\u2019s decision to deny Western\u2019s motion to enter evidence of contract formation at trial on the grounds that Western\u2019s earlier judicial admissions precluded it. <em>In re Raymond W. George Trust, </em>\u00b6 36.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-4\">\u00b644 Western argues next that the parties failed to mutually assent to the material term of freight hauling rates. Western admits that the April 25 letter \u201cexplicitly incorporates the freight hauling rates in existence in April 1996 ....\u201d Western also does not contest that it reimbursed Bitterroot according to the rates contained in the final draft logistics proposal for almost two years after the parties had signed the April 25 letter. Western argues, however, that the April 25 letter anticipated further negotiations on these \u201crates.\u201d Western asserts that the \u201cfurther negotiations provision\u201d makes these rates merely an unenforceable \u201cagreement to agree.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">\u00b645  We agree with Western that the clause in the April 25 letter that requires the parties to negotiate rates at a later date is not, on its face, an enforceable clause. <em>GRB, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 11-14 (holding that an agreement to agree is unenforceable). This unenforceable clause to further negotiate rates, however, does not change the fact that the parties mutually assented to the rate schedule contained in the final draft logistics proposal as evidenced by the fact that Western paid Bitterroot for its services according to the rate schedule provided in the final draft logistics proposal. The April 25 letter, by its express terms, and by the surrounding conduct of parties, represents a meeting of the minds with respect to all material terms. <em>GRB Farm, </em>\u00b6 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-6\">ISSUE THREE</p>\n<p id=\"b180-7\">\u00b646 <em>Did the District Court abuse its discretion by denying Western Star Trucks, Inc. leave to amend its answer to assert the statute of frauds defense?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b180-8\">\u00b647 Western argues that the District Court should have granted Western\u2019s motion to amend its answer to include a defense of statute of frauds. The District Court denied the motion to amend because Western had \u201ceffectively waive[d] its right to plead statute of frauds <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>under [M.

We review the district court\u2019s decision to amend for an abuse of discretion. <em>Lindey\u2019s, </em>244 Mont. at 242, 797 P.2d at 923.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-4\">\u00b649 Montana Rule of Civil Procedure 8(c) provides that \u201c[i]n pleading to a preceding pleading, a party shall set forth affirmatively ... statute of frauds ... and any other matter constituting an avoidance or affirmative defense.\u201d Rule 8(c) derives from \u201cthe same principles of fairness and notice which require a plaintiff to set forth the basis of the [plaintiffs claim] ....\u201d <em>Brown v. Ehlert, </em>255 Mont. 140, 146, 841 P.2d 510, 514 (1992). Rule 8(c) is not absolute, however, as the court retains discretion to allow a defendant to amend pursuant to the terms of M. R. Civ. P. 15 as determined by our holding in <em>Keller v. Dooling, </em>248 Mont. 535, 542, 813 P.2d 437, 441 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">\u00b650 Montana Rule of Civil Procedure 15(a) provides that \u201cleave [to amend] shall be freely given when justice so requires.\u201d Rule 15(a) favors allowing amendments, but a \u201ctrial court is justified in denying a motion for an apparent reason \u2018such as undue delay, bad faith or dilatory motive on the part of the movant, repeated failure to cure deficiencies by amendments previously allowed, undue prejudice to the opposing party by allowance of the amendment, futility of the amendment, etc.\u2019\u201d <em>Lindey\u2019s, </em>244 Mont. 238, 242, 797 P.2d 920, 923 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b181-6\">\u00b651 Western moved to amend its answer with an affirmative defense of statute of frauds in February of 2005. Bitterroot had filed its amended complaint in June of 2000, and the trial began in May of 2005. Western delayed placing Bitterroot on notice of Western\u2019s statute of frauds defense until three months before trial-almost five-years after Bitterroot had filed its amended complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-7\">\u00b652 Bitterroot argues that Western\u2019s belated attempt to amend its answer would have prejudiced Bitterroot\u2019s case because discovery already had closed. Bitterroot contends that the delay would have deprived it of the opportunity to seek discovery of admissions, documents, and witness testimony to establish the defenses to statute of frauds, including sufficiency of writings, part performance, and estoppel. Western asserts that Bitterroot had all the evidence necessary, and in any event, Western \u201cwas willing to reopen discovery <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>if necessary.\u201d Bitterroot responded that it already had deposed key witnesses in Canada at great expense and was reluctant to repeat the process.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-4\">\u00b653 Western points to \u201can oversight by Western Star\u2019s attorneys\u201d as the sole justification for its delay in asserting its affirmative defense. Western attempts to minimize this \u201coversight\u201d by arguing that the statute of frauds defense came as \u201cno surprise to Bitterroot\u201d because \u201c[t]he existence or non-existence of a written contract was always a central issue in this case.\u201d Western\u2019s counsel fails to explain adequately, however, how such an obvious defense escaped its attention for nearly five years.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">\u00b654  The District Court acted within its discretion in denying Western\u2019s motion to amend. The District Court reasonably could have decided that Western\u2019s belated amendment would have prejudiced Bitterroot\u2019s case, and Western failed to offer any meaningful justification for its delay. Moreover, we would render Rule 8(c)\u2019s purpose of providing adequate notice of affirmative defenses to the plaintiff a nullity if we were to allow Western to amend under these circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-6\">ISSUE FOUR</p>\n<p id=\"b182-7\">\u00b655 <em>Did the District Court abuse its discretion by instructing the jury regarding the \u201clost volume seller\u201d theory of damages?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b182-8\">\u00b656 Western argues that the District Court erroneously instructed the jury to consider the \u201clost volume seller\u201d theory. We review a trial court\u2019s jury instructions for an abuse of discretion. <em>Christofferson v. City of Great Falls, </em>2003 MT 189, \u00b6 9, 316 Mont. 469, \u00b6 9, 74 P.3d 1021, \u00b6 9. The party assigning error to a district court\u2019s jury instruction must show prejudice in order to prevail, and prejudice will not be found if the jury instructions in their entirety state the applicable law of the case. <em>Christofferson, </em>\u00b6 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-9\">\u00b657 Western proposed in pretrial proceedings that the court submit to the jury an instruction on the duty to mitigate. Bitterroot responded that \u201cmitigation is not an issue and should have been pled as an affirmative defense by [Western] in its answer.\u201d Bitterroot argued that if the court allowed an instruction on the duty to mitigate, then Bitterroot would request an instruction on lost volume seller theory. The District Court agreed and first instructed the jury on the duty to mitigate: \u201c[t]he Plaintiff has a duty to minimize their damages. However, that duty does not require them to do what is unreasonable or impracticable.\u201d The Court also instructed the jury on lost volume <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>seller theory:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-3\">As to damages claims after February 24,1998 if you find: (1) the seller of services possessed the capability to perform additional contracts simultaneously, (2) the additional contracts would have been profitable, and (3) the seller of services probably would have entered into the additional contracts even if the first contract had not terminated [, all] to be established by a preponderance of the evidence, then the gains, which were or could have been received by the non defaulting party by entering into another contract or transaction (mitigation) should not be used in reducing damages caused by a breach of contract.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b183-4\">\u00b658 Western argues that the lost volume seller theory represents an \u201cincorrect statement of law.\u201d The lost volume seller theory arises from the Uniform Commercial Code \u00a7 2-708(2), regarding the sale of goods. Western concedes that Montana has incorporated the lost volume seller theory as part of \u00a7 30-2-708(2), MCA, but argues against its application in this case for three reasons. First, Western contends that this Court has yet to address \u00a7 30-2-708(2), MCA, or adopt the lost volume seller theory of damages. Second, Western claims that the lost volume seller theory, in general, and \u00a7 30-2-708(2), MCA, in particular, relate to the sale of goods rather than services as provided by Bitterroot in this case. Finally, Western argues that even if the lost volume seller theory applies to the provision of services, Bitterroot failed to establish the required elements. Bitterroot admits that this Court has not considered the lost volume seller theory with respect to the provision of services, but suggests that we should join other jurisdictions in adopting the theory as described in the Restatement (Second) of Contracts.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">\u00b659 The term \u201clost volume seller\u201d originates from an article written by Professor Robert J. Harris entitled, A <em>Radical Restatement of the Law of Seller\u2019s Damages: Sales Act and Commercial Code Results Compared, </em>18 Stan. L. Rev. 66 (1965); <em>see also Famous Knitwear Corporation v. Drug Fair, Inc., </em>493 F.2d 251, 254 n. 5 (4th Cir. 1974); <em>Snyder v. Herbert Greenbaum &amp; Assoc. Inc., </em>380 A.2d 618, 624 n. 3 (Md. App. 1977). The lost volume seller theory allows a jury to consider the fact that an injured party, under certain circumstances, may not be made whole if its subsequent contracts diminish its losses.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">\u00b660 As described in Restatement (Second) of Contracts \u00a7 350 cmt. d (1981), \u201c[t]he mere fact that an injured party can make arrangements for the disposition of the goods <em>or services </em>that he was to supply under the contract does not necessarily mean that by doing so he will avoid <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>loss.\u201d (Emphasis added). The Restatement explains that if an injured party would have been able to enter both into the breached contract and a subsequent contract, then the subsequent contract is not a substitute for the breached contract, and the breached contract represents \u201clost volume.\u201d Restatement (Second) of Contracts \u00a7 350 cmt. d (1981); Restatement (Second) of Contracts \u00a7 347 cmt. f (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b184-4\">\u00b661 Courts that have adopted the Restatement\u2019s lost volume seller theory have followed Professor Harris\u2019s suggested test to determine whether a party qualifies as a lost volume seller: the injured party must prove (1) that it possessed the capacity to make additional sales, (2) that it would have been profitable to make additional sales, and (3) that it probably would have made additional sales absent the buyer\u2019s breach. <em>See e.g., Gianetti v. Norwalk </em>Hosp., 833 A.2d 891, 898 (Conn. <em>2003); R.E. Davis Chemical Corp. v. Diasonics, Inc., </em>826 F.2d 678, 685 (7th Cir. <em>1987); Rodriguez v. Learjet, Inc. </em>,946 P.2d 1010, 1014-15 (Kan. App. 1997); 22 Am. Jur. 2d Damages \u00a7 356; Restatement (Second) of Contracts \u00a7 350 illus. 10 (1981). This test captures the concept that an injured party sometimes could and would enter into a subsequent contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">\u00b662 Western argues that the lost volume seller theory departs from the traditional duty to mitigate damages in breach of contract claims. We have adopted the traditional requirement that an injured party cannot recover damages for breach of contract that the injured party reasonably could have avoided by entering into a subsequent contract. <em>Bronken\u2019s Good Time Co. v. J.W. Brown, </em>203 Mont. 427, 432-33, 661 P.2d 861, 864 (1983). Whether an injured party violated its duty to mitigate damages presents \u201ca question for the trier of fact when there is conflicting evidence.\u201d <em>Bronken\u2019s, </em>203 Mont. at 433, 661 P.2d at 864. The lost volume seller theory found in the Restatement, and codified at \u00a7 30-2-708(2), MCA, provides only a limited exception to this traditional rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-6\">\u00b663 This exception in no way undermines the requirement that an injured party must attempt to mitigate its damages in breach of contract claims. <em>Gierke v. Walker, </em>279 Mont. 349, 354, 927 P.2d 524, 527 (1996). Instead the Restatement allows a party to keep the monetary benefits of a breached contract, undiminished by the doctrine of mitigation of damages, if the party could have and would have entered into a second contract simultaneously with the breached contract. Restatement (Second) of Contracts \u00a7 347 cmt. f; <em>Gianetti, 833 </em>A.2d at 896-97. In this regard, we note that the District Court also instructed the jury on Bitterroot\u2019s duty to mitigate its losses. The court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>left it to the jury to decide whether Bitterroot\u2019s duty to mitigate its losses reduced its damages, or whether, in the alternative, Bitterroot qualified as a lost volume seller, thereby making Bitterroot eligible for an award of lost volume sales.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-3\">\u00b664 We agree with the reasoning underlying the lost volume seller theory as described in the Restatement (Second) of Contracts \u00a7 350 cmt. d and \u00a7 347 cmt. f. This reasoning comports with the Legislature\u2019s incorporation of the theory in \u00a7 30-2-708(2), MCA, for the sale of goods. Moreover, awarding lost profits to a lost volume seller serves the general principle of awarding damages to make a party whole by restoring the nonbreaching party to the position that party had occupied before the breach. In other words, we award compensatory damages to place a seller in as good a position as if a buyer had performed. <em>See Billings Clinic v. Peat Marwick </em>Main, 244 Mont. 324, 345, 797 P.2d 899, 913 (1990). We now join other jurisdictions in adopting the lost volume seller theory of damages. <em>See e.g. Gianetti, </em>833 A.2d at 898; <em>Jetz Service Co. v. Salina Properties, </em>865 P.2d 1051 (Kan. 1993); <em>Wired Music, Inc. v. Clark, </em>168 N.E.2d 736 (Ill.App.2d.1960); <em>R.E. Davis Chemical Corp., </em>826 F.2d at 681 &amp; n. 2 (7th Cir. 1987); <em>see </em>1 White &amp; Summers, Uniform Commercial Code \u00a7\u00a7 7-9, p. 385 n. 4 (4th ed. 1995) (listing cases that have applied \u00a7 2-708(2) to lost volume sellers). The District Court\u2019s lost volume seller instruction to the jury represented a correct statement of law, and, therefore, did not unfairly prejudice Western. <em>Christofferson, </em>\u00b6 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-4\">\u00b665 Western argues in the alternative that the lost volume seller theory of damages arises from the Uniform Commercial Code and, therefore, the theory applies only to contracts for the sale of goods. Western contends that the theory has no application here where Bitterroot provided freight hauling and logistics services, rather than goods. Western misplaces its reliance on the Uniform Commercial Code, however, as we have adopted the lost volume seller theory that arises out of the Restatement (Second) of Contracts \u00a7 350 cmt. d and \u00a7 347 cmt. f (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">\u00b666 The lost volume seller theory described in these sections of the Restatement applies with equal force to goods and services. Restatement (Second) of Contracts \u00a7 350 cmt. d (1981) (referring to the sale of goods or services). As noted in Murray on Contracts \u00a7 122 D.l (3d ed. 1990), \u201c[a] supplier of services may be able to convince a court that he would have been able to perform a second opportunity that became available after the original contract was breached.\u201d The supplier of services under these circumstances presumably \u201ccould have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>performed both contracts and received both profits absent strong evidence to the contrary.\u201d Murray on Contracts \u00a7 122 D.l (3d ed. 1990). The extension of the lost volume seller theory to services is neither new, nor novel.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-4\">\u00b667 For example, the court in <em>Wired Music, </em>168 N.E.2d 736, determined that a distributor of music by telephone wires with an unlimited supply of music could recover lost profits for the remaining months under a contract from a customer who discontinued service before the contract had expired. <em>Wired </em>Music, 168 N.E.2d at 738-39. The distributor had entered into another contract for service at the same location with a new tenant for a higher fee. The breaching party argued that the distributor had mitigated its damages through this new contract and thus relieved the breaching party of any liability. The court disagreed. The distributor had presented evidence that it could supply any number of additional customers without incurring further expenses except for the rental wire. To adopt the breaching party\u2019s contention \u201cwould have the effect of denying the [distributor] the benefit of his bargain.\u201d <em>Wired Music, </em>168 N.E.2d at 738-39. The court refused to apply its usual mitigation of damages rule as it would have served to deprive the distributor \u201cof the true measure of damages.\u201d <em>Wired Music, </em>168 N.E.2d at 739.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">\u00b668  The court in <em>Gianetti </em>likewise recognized that \u201c[although the lost volume seller theory is commonly understood to apply to contracts involving the sale of goods, it applies with equal force to contracts involving the performance of personal services such as employment contracts.\u201d <em>Gianetti, </em>833 A.2d at 897. Similarly, the court in <em>Jetz Service Co., </em>865 P.2d at 1057-58, applied the lost volume seller theory to a provider of leased laundry equipment. <em>See also C.I.C. Corp. v. Ragtime, Inc., </em>726 A.2d 316, 319-21 (N.J. Super. Ct. App. Div. 1999) (lessor of vending machines). We agree with the courts in these other jurisdictions and apply the lost volume seller theory of damages to services, as provided by Bitterroot in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-6\">\u00b669 Western argues finally that because Bitterroot failed to \u201cprove\u201d the required elements to qualify as a lost volume seller, the District Court abused its discretion in instructing the jury regarding lost volume seller damages. Western appears to argue that the District Court first should have resolved whether Bitterroot was a lost volume seller before the court permitted the jury to consider lost volume seller damages. The question of whether an injured party violated its duty to mitigate damages presents a question for the trier of fact. <em>Bronken\u2019s, </em>203 Mont. at 433, 661 P.2d at 864. Our review of the relevant case law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>indicates that the question of whether an injured party qualifies as a lost volume seller likewise presents a question to be resolved by the trier of fact. <em>See e.g. Bill\u2019s Coal Co. v. Board of Public Utilities, </em>887 F.2d 242, 245 (10th Cir. 1989); <em>C.I.C. Corp., </em>726 A.2d at 319-20; <em>Gianetti, </em>833 A.2d at 900; 67A Am. Jur. 2d Sales \u00a7 1004 <em>citing Tigg Corp. v. Dow Corning Corp., </em>962 F.2d 1119, 1130 (3d Cir. 1992). The jury served that role here. Western cites no authority to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"ABM\">\u00b670 The question arises whether the jury properly found Bitterroot to be a lost volume seller. We review a jury\u2019s findings of fact to determine whether substantial credible evidence supports those findings. <em>Hoffman v. Austin, </em>2006 MT 289, \u00b6 13, 334 Mont. 357, \u00b6 13, 147 P.3d 177, \u00b6 13. Bitterroot presented evidence that it expected its business to grow at a rate of thirteen to fourteen percent per year, buttressed by the introduction into evidence of its tax returns and consolidated financial statements. Bitterroot also presented evidence that it had a brokerage division that could contract with other carriers to handle excess freight volume. Thus, Bitterroot argued, it profitably could have serviced the Western contract and other contracts that it entered after Western\u2019s breach. Substantial credible evidence supports the jury\u2019s determination that Bitterroot qualified as a lost volume seller. <em>Hoffman, </em>\u00b6 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-3\">\u00b671  The District Court instructed the jury on the concepts of mitigation and the lost volume seller theory. Both instructions represent correct statements of the law. The jury served the role of resolving any factual disputes regarding Bitterroot\u2019s duty to mitigate its losses and its alleged ability profitably to service the Western contract and the other contract that it entered after Western\u2019s breach. Our role is to determine whether these instructions, in their entirety, state the applicable law. <em>Christofferson, </em>\u00b6 9. We determine that the District Court did not abuse its discretion in offering the lost volume seller theory instruction to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-4\">\u00b672 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b187-5\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICE LEAPHART, NELSON, RICE, COTTER and WARNER concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
