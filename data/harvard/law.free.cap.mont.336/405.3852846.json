We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-7\">\u00b62 We restate the issues on appeal as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b430-8\">\u00b63 (1) Did the District Court abuse its discretion by terminating Father M.H.\u2019s parental rights to L.H.?</p>\n<p id=\"b430-9\">\u00b64 (2) Did the District Court fail to make requisite statutoiy findings before terminating Mother A.S.\u2019s parental rights to L.H.?</p>\n<p id=\"b430-10\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b430-11\">\u00b65 L.H. was born on September 9, 2004, to A.S. and M.H. A.S. had previously given birth to S.S. and K.H., and M.H. is the natural father to K.H. While A.S. was pregnant with L.H., M.H. voluntarily relinquished his parental rights to K.H. following his failure to comply with two treatment plans by reason of criminal activity involving alcohol and drug use. In a separate proceeding, A.S.\u2019s parental rights to S.S. and K.H. were also involuntarily terminated by the District Court. An appeal taken by A.S. in that proceeding, before this Court as Cause No. DA 06-0088, was dismissed by this Court. Although this case addresses L.H. only, the proceeding regarding S.S. and K.H. affects this matter and thus will be referenced herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-12\">\u00b66 When L.H. was born, the proceeding initiated by the Department of Public Health and Human Services (DPHHS) regarding A.S.\u2019s other two children was pending, and the District Court had, on August 18, 2003, adjudicated S.S. and K.H. as youths in need of care. The children, although still residing with A.S. and M.H., were under the temporary legal custody of DPHHS.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Upon L.H.\u2019s birth, DPHHS did not amend its proceeding to include L.H., because A.S. and M.H. were already working under a court-approved treatment plan, which DPHHS believed offered necessary protections for L.H.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>\u00b67 Two months after L.H.\u2019s birth, A.S. was committed to the custody of the Department of Corrections and was incarcerated until February 2006. L.H. remained in the care of M.H., but was removed from M.H. by DPHHS on February 23, 2005, following M.H.\u2019s arrest for a probation violation-testing positive for methamphetamine. In a separate proceeding, DPHHS filed a petition for emergency protective services and temporary legal custody of L.H. On February 28, 2005, the District Court granted that petition, finding probable cause to believe that L.H. had been abused or neglected and immediate protection was required. The court also appointed a guardian ad litem for L.H. Following a show cause hearing on March 14, 2005, the District Court entered an order purporting to adjudicate L.H. as a youth in need of care, and granting DPHHS temporary legal custody of L.H. for a period of six months.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-4\">\u00b68 On March 23,2005, the State filed a motion for permanency plan hearing in L.H.\u2019s case. Because a separate permanency plan hearing had also been scheduled in DN-02-01-the proceeding involving S.S. and K.H.-the court consolidated the two cases and set a single permanency plan hearing for all three children. At the permanency plan hearing, counsel for A.S. raised an objection to the proceeding, arguing that the March 14, 2005, show cause hearing did not satisfy statutory procedural requirements for adjudication of L.H. as a youth in need of care. The District Court concurred and scheduled an adjudicatory hearing for L.H. Prior to that hearing, the parties filed a stipulation which stated, in part, that all three children \u201care Youths in Need of Care by reason of the incarceration of their natural mother, [A.S.]; abandonment by the natural father of S.S., [A.G.]; and incarceration of the natural father of [K.H.] and [L.H.], [M.H.].\u201d Based on this stipulation, the court entered a new order adjudicating L.H. as a youth in the need of care and vacating the adjudicatory hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-5\">\u00b69 On August 1,2005, a dispositional hearing was held and attended by counsel for both parents, but by neither parent, who were both incarcerated. At the hearing, the District Court approved the proposed treatment plans for M.H. and A.S., allowing for appropriate future modifications to be made to the plan upon either parent\u2019s release, and extended DPHHS\u2019s temporary legal custody of the children.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-6\">\u00b610 Thereafter, DPHHS petitioned to terminate both parents\u2019 rights to S.S. and K.H., based upon the parents\u2019 actions under the treatment plans regarding those children. On December 13, 2005, the District Court entered an order separating L.H. from the case involving S.S. and K.H. However, on January 10, 2006, DPHHS filed a petition to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>terminate both parents\u2019 rights to L.H as well. The petition alleged that neither parent had complied with their respective treatment plan, and, alternatively, with regard to A.S., a treatment plan was not necessary as A.S.\u2019s parental rights to L.H.\u2019s siblings had already been involuntarily terminated, and the circumstances of that termination were relevant to her ability to adequately care for L.H.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-4\">\u00b611 On March 2, 2006, the District Court conducted a hearing on the petition to terminate parental rights to L.H., -with both parents and their respective counsel attending. The court took judicial notice of DC-03-19 and DC-03-36, two criminal cases involving M.H. and A.S., respectively. The court also took judicial notice of companion case DN-02-01, involving L.H.\u2019s two older siblings, wherein the court had by then entered an order terminating both parents\u2019 rights to those children. Neither party objected to the court taking judicial notice of these actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">\u00b612 On March 22, 2006, the District Court issued its findings of fact, conclusions of law, and order terminating both M.H.\u2019s and A.S.\u2019s parental rights to L.H. and awarding permanent legal custody of L.H. to DPHHS. M.H. and A.S. appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b432-7\">\u00b613 \u201cA district court\u2019s decision to terminate parental rights is discretionary and we review that decision to determine whether the court abused its discretion.\u201d <em>In re J.W., </em>2001 MT 86, \u00b6 7, 305 Mont. 149, \u00b6 7, 23 P.3d 916, \u00b6 7 (citing <em>In re Custody of C.F., </em>2001 MT 19, \u00b6 11, 304 Mont. 134, \u00b6 11, 18 P.3d 1014, \u00b6 11). However, \u201c[a] parent\u2019s right to care and custody of a child is a fundamental liberty interest.\u201d <em>In re J.A.B., </em>1999 MT 173, \u00b6 14, 295 Mont. 227, \u00b6 14, 983 P.2d 387, \u00b6 14. Therefore, when determining whether to terminate parental rights, a district court must make specific factual findings in accordance with the requirements set forth in \u00a7 41-3-609, MCA. <em>Custody of C.F., </em>\u00b6\u00b6 11-12. We review those findings of fact to determine whether they are clearly erroneous. <em>Custody of C.F., </em>\u00b6 11. This Court explained the clearly erroneous standard as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b432-10\">A finding of fact is clearly erroneous if it is not supported by substantial evidence, if the court misapprehended the effect of the evidence or if, upon reviewing the record, this Court is left with the definite and firm conviction that the district court made a mistake.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b432-11\"><em>In re J.W., </em>\u00b6 7 (citing <em>Custody of C.F., </em>\u00b6 11). We review a district court\u2019s conclusions of law in terminating parental rights for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>correctness. <em>In re B.F., </em>2000 MT 231, \u00b6 7, 301 Mont. 281, \u00b6 7, 8 P.3d 790, \u00b6 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">\u00b614  A District Court may terminate am individual\u2019s parental rights if it finds by clear and convincing evidence that the child has been adjudicated a youth in need of care; an appropriate court-approved treatment plan has not been complied with or has been unsuccessful; and the conduct or condition rendering the parent unfit is unlikely to change within a reasonable period of time. Section 41-3-609(l)(f), MCA. The District Court concluded that these three statutory conditions had been established regarding M.H. and A.S. and therefore terminated their parental rights to L.H.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b433-6\">\u00b615 <em>(1) Did the District Court abuse its discretion by terminating Father M.H.\u2019sparental rights to L.H.?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b433-7\">\u00b616 M.H. argues the District Court erred in terminating his parental rights, because the court lacked substantial evidence to do so and thereby abused its discretion. In its findings of fact, conclusions of law, and order terminating M.H.\u2019s parental rights, the District Court found that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-8\">while the magnitude of the parents\u2019 noncompliance with the treatment plans in this particular case is not monumental, the noncompliance must be viewed in the context of their previous failures and the limited treatment plan requirements and limited opportunities they had to fail. If A.S. and M.H. cannot obey the rules for a period of months in a strictly controlled environment, knowing the possible consequences of failure, it is unrealistic to conclude that they would be able to obey the rules over a much longer period of time in an unstructured environment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ab0\">Addressing the likelihood of change by M.H., the court found that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-9\">The conduct which renders M.H. an unfit parent is not likely to change within a reasonable time. This finding is based upon the fact that M.H. is presently incarcerated with an uncertain parole date. Further, M.H. has a long-term drug and alcohol problem and has repeatedly demonstrated inability to obey the law and abide by society\u2019s mies. The welfare and future of a young child is to[o] important to gamble on the improbability that M.H. will be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>prepared and able, once he is paroled, to live a drug-free, crime-free life.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b434-4\">\u00b617 Based on these findings, the court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b434-5\">The statutory criteria for termination of A.S.\u2019s and M.H.\u2019s parental rights, as set forth in \u00a7 41-3-609(l)(f), MCA, have been met. Appropriate treatment plans were approved by the Court but were not complied with by either parent. The conduct or conditions which render A.S. and M.H. unfit to parent L.H. are unlikely to change within a reasonable time. In reaching this conclusion, the Court gives primary consideration to the physical, mental, and emotional conditions and needs of the child.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b434-6\">Taking into account the physical, mental, and emotional needs of the child, the Court concludes that it is in the best interests of L.H. to terminate the parents\u2019 parental rights and to authorize the Department to consent to the child\u2019s adoption.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AJ7\">\n<em>a. Completion of Treatment Plan</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b434-7\">\u00b618 M.H. contends he was successful in completing the conditions of his treatment plan to the extent that it was possible for him. M.H. argues that he completed ten months of AA/NA meetings while incarcerated but contends he was unable to provide written documentation of this attendance, because he was not allowed to take paper or pencils into the meetings. He states that he sent L.H. written correspondence, only stopping when he ran out of envelopes. He also offers that he could not satisfy the condition of calling his social worker via the toll free number because the jail only allowed him to place collect calls. Consequently, given these obstacles, M.H. maintains that his only true \u201cfailure\u201d was the write-up he received for being on the wrong floor while he was in the county jail, and that this infraction does not constitute substantial evidence that he was unfit to parent L.H., but, rather, that he was \u201csuccessful with his treatment plan.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AhM\">\u00b619 \u201cWe have repeatedly held that complete compliance with a treatment plan is required, as opposed to partial compliance or even substantial compliance.\u201d <em>In re A.A., </em>2005 MT 119, \u00b6 31, 327 Mont. 127, \u00b6 31, 112 P.3d 993, \u00b6 31 (citing <em>In re D.V., </em>2003 MT 160, \u00b6 27, 316 Mont. 282, \u00b6 27, 70 P.3d 1253, \u00b6 27) (citation omitted). Moreover, the relevant statute, \u00a7 41-3-609(l)(f)(i), MCA, \u201cis written in the disjunctive-a treatment plan has not been complied with <em>or </em>has not been successful\u201d and \u201ccompleting all tasks in a treatment plan does not necessarily mean the plan is \u2018successful.\u2019 \u201d <em>In re A.F., </em>2003 MT 254, \u00b6 25, 317 Mont. 367, \u00b6 25, 77 P.3d 266, \u00b6 25 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b435-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>\u00b620 M.H. had a history of criminal conduct and had failed to complete previous treatment plans and rules of probation, making it particularly important for M.H. to demonstrate that he could maintain a clean record while incarcerated. Indeed, his treatment plan herein required that he have \u201c[n]o criminal activity, write-ups or disciplinary infractions while incarcerated.\u201d Yet, as M.H. admits, he committed a rule infraction while at the Flathead County Detention Facility by remaining on an off-limits floor of that facility. Additionally, at the termination hearing, detention officers who had M.H. in their charge testified about several other rule infractions, including M.H.\u2019s continuing correspondence with A.S. in knowing violation of a facility rule, showing disrespect to a detention officer, and wrapping his head and body in a blanket in the day area even though this conduct was forbidden for safety reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-4\">\u00b621 Given a treatment plan which contemplated his incarceration, M.H. nonetheless was unable to comply with conditions. He offered various reasons why he failed to provide written documentation of his AA/NA attendance, failed to correspond to L.H., and failed to keep in contact with his social worker, but the District Court determined these to be unpersuasive, finding that \u201cA.S. was relatively compliant with these requirements, but M.H. was not.\u201d Indeed, while M.H. alleges that he could not write to L.H. because he only received two envelopes and four pieces of paper every two weeks, the testimony indicated that M.H. did not have any contact with his son over a five- to six-month period. Such a huge lapse in contact cannot be excused on the basis of insufficient envelopes and provides clear evidence in support of the District Court\u2019s findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">\u00b622  We do not disturb a trial court\u2019s finding of fact on abuse and neglect unless it is clearly erroneous. <em>In re F.M., </em>2002 MT 180, \u00b6 21, 311 Mont. 35, \u00b6 21, 53 P.3d 368, \u00b6 21. Here, the District Court did not misapprehend the effect of the evidence, nor are we left with a firm conviction that the District Court made a mistake. Rather, the District Court\u2019s findings that M.H. failed to complete the minimal tasks of the treatment plan in a strictly controlled environment are supported by substantial evidence. While some of M.H.\u2019s infractions may seem insignificant individually, in light of his prior failures with treatment plans, his current plan, and his circumstances, they were not inconsequential. We conclude that the District Court correctly concluded that M.H. failed to successfully complete his treatment plan,</p>\n<p id=\"AKM\">b. <em>M.H.\u2019s Conduct or Condition Unlikely to Change Within Reasonable Time</em></p>\n<p id=\"b436-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>\u00b623 Under \u00a7 41-3-609(l)(f)(ii), MCA, the court must conclude that \u201cthe conduct or condition of the parents rendering them unfit is unlikely to change within a reasonable time.\u201d Section 41-3-609(2), MCA, provides criteria for a court\u2019s consideration of this issue, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-4\">(2) In determining whether the conduct or condition of the parents is unlikely to change within a reasonable time, the court shall enter a finding that continuation of the parent-child legal relationship will likely result in continued abuse or neglect or that the conduct or the condition of the parents renders the parents unfit, unable, or unwilling to give the child adequate parental care. In making the determinations, the court shall consider but is not limited to the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-5\">(a) emotional illness, mental illness, or mental deficiency of the parent of a duration or nature as to render the parent unlikely to care for the ongoing physical, mental, and emotional needs of the child within a reasonable time;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-6\">(b) a history of violent behavior by the parent;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-7\">(c) <em>excessive use of intoxicating liquor or of a narcotic or dangerous drug that affects the parent\u2019s ability to care and provide for the child', </em>and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-8\">(d) present judicially ordered long-term confinement of the parent.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b436-9\">Section 41-3-609(2), MCA (emphasis added). The criterion at issue here is sub-paragraph (c), \u201cexcessive use of intoxicating liquor or of a narcotic or dangerous drug\u201d affecting M.H.\u2019s future ability to care and provide for L.H. Section 41-3-609(2)(c), MCA. In making such a determination, we have noted that the court must \u201c\u2018assess past and present conduct of the parent.\u2019\u201d <em>In re A.S., </em>2006 MT 281, \u00b6 48, 334 Mont. 280, \u00b6 48, 146 P.3d 778, \u00b6 48 (quoting <em>In re M.A.E., </em>1999 MT 341, \u00b6 37, 297 Mont. 434, \u00b6 37, 991 P.2d 972, \u00b6 37) (citation omitted). In <em>Matter of W.Z., </em>285 Mont. 16, 25, 946 P.2d 125, 131 (1997), we concluded that the District Court properly looked to the mother\u2019s extensive history of alcoholic behavior prior to finding that her conduct and behavior was unlikely to change within a reasonable time.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-10\">\u00b624 In addressing M.H.\u2019s likelihood of change, the District Court entered the following finding of fact:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-11\">The conduct which renders M.H. an unfit parent is not likely to change within a reasonable time. This finding is based upon the fact that M.H. is presently incarcerated with an uncertain parole date. Further, M.H. has a long-term drug and alcohol problem and has repeatedly demonstrated inability to obey the law and abide <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>by society\u2019s rules. The welfare and future of a young child is to[o] important to gamble on the improbability that M.H. will be prepared and able, once he is paroled, to live a drug-free, crime-free life.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b437-4\">\u00b625 M.H. argues that the only evidence the District Court could have relied on in entering this finding was his previous failures under treatment plans regarding his daughter, K.H., to whom he ultimately voluntarily relinquished his parental rights. Thus, while acknowledging that a court may generally look at his past, M.H. nonetheless contends that, pursuant to \u00a7 41-3-423(2)(e), MCA, which permits a court to make a finding that the department need not seek reunification with the parent who has had rights to other children involuntarily terminated, it was impermissible for the court to consider his actions with regard to K.H., because he <em>voluntarily </em>relinquished his rights to K.H., and did not have them involuntarily terminated by a court. Additionally, M.H. insists the circumstances relative to the termination of M.H.\u2019s parental rights to K.H. are not relevant to the circumstances surrounding L.H. because his life circumstances have changed and he is not now involved in criminal and drug activity. We disagree with M.H.\u2019s contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-5\">\u00b626 The authority granted to a court by \u00a7 41-3-423(2)(e), MCA, to reheve the department from providing reunification efforts to a parent who has had parental rights to other children involuntarily terminated does not also operate to prohibit a court from considering, as evidence in a subsequent proceeding, a parent\u2019s history with regard to other children for whom the parent has voluntarily relinquished his or her parental rights. A parent\u2019s track record in the raising of children is a critical consideration in determining the parent\u2019s likelihood of future success. Therefore, M.H.\u2019s reliance on \u00a7 41-3-423(2)(e), MCA, for such a proposition is incorrect, and the District Court did not err in looking to this evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-6\">\u00b627  While M.H. argues that his conduct has changed since the period of time when he relinquished his rights to K.H., as he no longer abuses drugs and alcohol, he acknowledges that such use was the basis of his stipulation that L.H. was a youth in need of care. Moreover, M.H.\u2019s positive test for methamphetamines on February 22,2005, led to the taking of L.H. and his siblings from M.H.\u2019s care and their placement into foster care. As the State notes, it may be true, as M.H. claims, that he was not using drugs or engaged in criminal activity for most of this proceeding. However, M.H. was incarcerated for most of that period, and thus, it would have been irresponsible for the court to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>overlook M.H.\u2019s serious chemical dependency history and to simply accept M.H.\u2019s assertion that these problems were forever solved. The District Court\u2019s findings on the evidence, supported by judicial notice it took of the abuse and neglect proceedings for K.H. and S.S., and the criminal proceedings against M.H., were supported by substantial evidence demonstrating that M.H.\u2019s condition rendering him unfit to parent was unlikely to change within a reasonable time. Therefore, M.H. has established no error or abuse of discretion in the District Court\u2019s termination of his parental rights to L.H.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-4\">\u00b628 <em>(2) Did the District Court fail to make requisite statutory findings before terminating Mother A.S.\u2019s parental rights to L.H.?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">\u00b629 A.S.\u2019s challenge to the District Court\u2019s findings of fact, conclusions of law and order terminating her parental rights to L.H. consists merely of incorporating the arguments set forth in her briefing filed in Cause No. DA-06-0088, her appeal in the termination proceeding for her other two children, S.S. and K.H., and attaching that brief as an exhibit to her brief filed herein. In that earlier briefing, A.S. argued that the District Court had erred by failing to make findings necessary to demonstrate that the children were youths in need of care. This Court dismissed that appeal, concluding that A.S. was raising issues for the first time, for which objections had not been made in the District Court. <em>See </em>Order, <em>In re the Matter of S.S. and K.H., </em>No. 06-0088, October 10, 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-6\">\u00b630 Here, within the proceeding regarding L.H., Ms. Guth, counsel for A.S., did enter an objection in the District Court that appropriate proceedings and findings establishing that L.H. was a youth in need of care had not been completed. Indeed, the State acknowledged this objection within its briefing in DA 06-0088, arguing that \u201cMs. Guth could have objected to the district court orders when they were issued. ... [T]his was done in the Matter of L.H. at the April 2005 hearing, when Ms. Guth objected to the lack of adjudication of L.H.\u201d Thus, unlike in DA 06-0088, A.S. is not raising this issue for first time on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-7\">\u00b631 However, A.S.\u2019s arguments make no mention of the proceedings that transpired following her objection. The District Court concurred with her objection, agreeing that the March 14, 2005, show cause hearing did not satisfy the procedural requirements for adjudication of L.H. as a youth in need of care and scheduled sequential adjudicatory and dispositional hearings. Then, prior to the adjudicatory hearing, A.S., with M.H., entered a stipulation with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>DPHHS for adjudication of L.H. as a youth in the need of care, and based upon that stipulation, the District Court entered a new order so adjudicating L.H. In that order, the District Court also found that DPHHS had made reasonable efforts to avoid protective placement of L.H. and to safely return L.H. to the parents\u2019 home, but that such a placement was not in L.H.\u2019s best interests. The court also then proceeded, on August 1, 2005, to a dispositional hearing. A.S. failed to make any further objection to this procedure. Accordingly, we affirm the court\u2019s termination of A.S.\u2019s parental rights to L.H.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-4\">\u00b632 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b439-5\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES COTTER, WARNER and LEAPHART concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b430-13\"> A.S. and M.H. then resided together, but were not married.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b433-10\"> We again note that, pursuant to the stipulation entered by A.S. and M.H., the District Court entered an order adjudicating L.H. as a youth in need of care, which satisfied the first statutory factor.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
