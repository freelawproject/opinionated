Dahlquist subsequently filed a motion to confirm, alleging the action was subject to an arbitration award. The District Court denied the motion to confirm the arbitration award because the arbitration procedure failed to conform to the arbitration agreement. From the denial of his motion to confirm, Dahlquist appeals. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-3\">\u00b62 We restate the issue as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b125-4\">\u00b63 Did the District Court correctly deny Dahlquist\u2019s motion to confirm when the arbitration award was issued by an arbitrator other than the one specified in the arbitration agreement, even though Citibank failed to dispute the award within ninety days?</p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b125-6\">\u00b64 On March 19, 2004, Citibank filed a complaint alleging that Dahlquist owed $7,955.01 pursuant to a credit card agreement with Citibank. Citibank apparently filed two different actions against Dahlquist without adequately specifying the account number. Dahlquist responded to one suit, but not the other. The court initially entered a default against Dahlquist, but then set aside the default judgment, citing the confusion regarding the double suit without adequate account numbers.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-7\">\u00b65 Dahlquist then filed a motion to confirm an arbitration award. The arbitration award had been issued by the National Arbitration Counsel (NAC), an arbitration group based in Florida.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In response to NAC\u2019s notices, Citibank informed NAC by letter that it had not agreed, and would not agree, to arbitrate any disputes before NAC. Despite Citibank\u2019s letter, NAC issued an award for Dahlquist and against Citibank on the debt that Citibank alleges is owed by Dahlquist. Citibank did not move to vacate the award, and in fact did not challenge the award until February 8, 2005, in its response to Dahlquist\u2019s motion to set aside the entry of default.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-8\">\u00b66 The arbitration agreement at issue does not list NAC as a potential arbitrator. Instead the agreement provides that one of three arbitrators must be used: the American Arbitration Association (AAA); JAMS; or the National Arbitration Forum (NAF). Additionally, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>arbitration agreement provides that it \u201cis governed by the Federal Arbitration Act\u201d (FAA).</p>\n<p id=\"b126-4\">\u00b67 The District Court, in its order denying Dahlquist\u2019s motion to confirm, concluded that Dahlquist\u2019s use of NAC was \u201cnot in accordance with the arbitration provisions of the agreement\u201d and thus the NAC arbitration was \u201cinvalid <em>ab initio\u201d </em>and \u201cthe statutory time limits to challenge the award [were] not triggered.\u201d From this order, Dahlquist appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b126-6\">\u00b68 We review a district court\u2019s conclusions of law, including whether an arbitration award is valid, <em>de novo. See Martz v. Beneficial Montana, Inc., </em>2006 MT 94, \u00b6 10, 332 Mont. 93, \u00b6 10, 135 P.3d 790, \u00b6 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b126-8\">\u00b69 Did the District Court correctly deny Dahlquist\u2019s motion to confirm when the arbitration award was issued by an arbitrator other than the one specified in the arbitration agreement, even though Citibank failed to dispute the award within ninety days?</p>\n<p id=\"b126-9\">\u00b610 Dahlquist, focusing primarily upon Montana\u2019s Uniform Arbitration Act, \u00a7\u00a7 27-5-111 through -324, MCA, claims that Citibank has waived the right to challenge the arbitration award issued by NAC because it failed to challenge the award within ninety days. <em>See </em>\u00a7\u00a727-5-311 and -312, MCA. Under Montana law, the ninety-day time limit on challenging an award affixes even if a party claims the award is invalid because the wrong arbitrator was used. See \u00a7 27-5-312, MCA. As Citibank has waited much longer than that, Dahlquist insists Citibank is barred from challenging the NAC award and the District Court must confirm the award.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-10\">\u00b611 We disagree with Dahlquist\u2019s assessment, primarily because the arbitration agreement at issue, by its terms, is not governed by Montana\u2019s arbitration statutes but by the FAA (9 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1-16). While the provisions of the FAA are similar to Montana\u2019s Act, including a three-month time limitation to vacate an award, the FAA, unlike Montana law, does not recognize a motion to vacate an award for the reason that \u201cthere was no arbitration agreement.\u201d See \u00a7 27-5-312, MCA, and 9 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 10-12.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-11\">\u00b612 Under the FAA, where parties have not agreed to arbitrate, or where the arbitration does not follow the format provided for in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>arbitration agreement, the arbitration award is invalid <em>ab initio. See MCI Telecommunications Corp. v. Exalon Industries, Inc., </em>138 F.3d 426, 430 (1st Cir. 1998), and <em>Bank of America, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 12-13. In <em>MCI, </em>the First Circuit determined that, for a party to be subject to the FAA\u2019s three-month time limitation, a written arbitration agreement must be \u201cin effect\u201d <em>and </em>the party must be \u201cbound by [the] conditions\u201d of the agreement. <em>MCI, </em>138 F.3d at 430. One condition that must be followed for an arbitration proceeding to be valid under the FAA is employment of the agreed upon arbitrator. <em>See </em>9 U.S.C. \u00a7 5 and <em>R. J. O\u2019Brien &amp; Assoc., Inc. v. Pipkin, </em>64 F.3d 257, 263 (7th Cir. 1995) (\u201c[I]n order to enforce an arbitration award, the arbitrator must be chosen in conformance with the procedure specified in the parties\u2019 agreement to arbitrate.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b127-3\">\u00b613  Here, the arbitration agreement specifically limits the arbitrators that may be used to AAA, JAMS or NAF. Dahlquist, however, did not use one of the three named groups, but unilaterally selected NAC. As Citibank had not agreed to arbitrate the dispute before NAC, and as the agreement specifically calls for AAA, JAMS or NAF to be used, the award is unenforceable, under <em>R. J. O\u2019Brien, </em>because NAC was not chosen in conformance with the arbitration agreement. Further, the arbitration award was invalid <em>ab initio </em>under <em>MCI, </em>because, while there is a written arbitration agreement, Citibank had not consented to be bound by NAC, and in fact had notified NAC by letter that it had not agreed and would not agree to arbitrate before NAC. The FAA time limitation was thus not triggered, and Citibank is not bound by the award, even though it failed to challenge it within three months.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-4\">\u00b614 Dahlquist, citing to several federal cases, contends that even under the FAA, the three-month time limitation bars Citibank from challenging the award. The cases cited by Dahlquist, however, are distinguishable from the issue at hand because, in each case, the parties arbitrated the dispute in conformance with a valid arbitration agreement. For example, Dahlquist cites to <em>Sander v. Weyerhaeuser Co., </em>966 F.2d 501, 503 (9th Cir. 1992), for the proposition that the FAA\u2019s three-month limitation \u201cis meaningless if a party to the arbitration proceedings may bring an independent direct action asserting such claims outside of the statutory time period.\u201d (Citations omitted.) However, this proposition is inapplicable to the situation here, because the party in <em>Sander </em>consented to and participated in arbitration, and then, two years later, challenged the award, a valuation of stock, alleging a violation of securities laws. The Ninth <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>Circuit refused to allow an arbitration participant to challenge the resulting award via \u201ccollateral attack.\u201d <em>Sander, </em>966 F.2d at 502-03. Here, Citibank, unlike the party in <em>Sander, </em>was not \u201ca party to the arbitration proceeding\u201d nor did it consent to arbitration with NAC.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-4\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">\u00b615  Under the FAA, the arbitration award was invalid <em>ab initio </em>because NAC was not the arbitrator specified in the arbitration agreement, and Citibank did not consent to arbitration under NAC. The District Court\u2019s denial of Dahlquist\u2019s motion to confirm is therefore affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b128-6\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES NELSON, COTTER, WARNER, MORRIS and RICE concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b125-9\"> <em>See Bank of America v.
