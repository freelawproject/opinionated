We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">\u00b62 We state the issue as follows: Did the District Court err in denying Luckett\u2019s motion to dismiss based on its finding that the arresting officer had particularized suspicion to conduct an investigative stop of Luckett\u2019s vehicle?</p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b165-7\">\u00b63 On February 11, 2005, around 7:20 p.m., Deputy Reyna of the Yellowstone County Sheriffs Department was patrolling the area of the Pelican Truck Stop near Billings, Montana. Deputy Resma observed two men, later identified as Luckett and Harold Creighton, standing in the parking lot, drinking beer. Three other men later joined Luckett and Creighton in the parking lot. Shortly thereafter, Deputy Reyna observed either Luckett or Creighton place his beer on the ground and enter a Ford Crown Victoria. Luckett was later identified as the driver of the Crown Victoria. Deputy Reyna followed Luckett as Luckett drove onto Interstate 90. Deputy Reyna testified that he followed Luckett to \u201cmake sure they were okay\u201d as he had just witnessed the two men drinking beer.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-8\">\u00b64 Once on Interstate 90 Deputy Reyna followed Luckett, who was headed west towards Laurel, Montana. The other men in Luckett\u2019s group also were driving on Interstate 90 and were in a white pickup track that was traveling between Deputy Reyna and Luckett. Despite the white pickup track between him and Luckett\u2019s Crown Victoria, Deputy Reyna was still able to observe Luckett\u2019s driving. In particular, Deputy Reyna observed Luckett driving at 50 miles per horn in a 75 miles her horn speed zone while weaving and also crossing the fog fine on at least two occasions. Luckett exited Interstate 90 at Laurel where Deputy Reyna proceeded to initiate a traffic stop. Based upon his contact with Luckett, Deputy Reyna believed Luckett was under the influence of alcohol.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-9\">\u00b65 Luckett was subsequently charged with driving under the influence of alcohol (DUI) and careless driving. Luckett filed a motion to dismiss arguing lack of particularized suspicion. The District Court denied the motion. Pursuant to a plea agreement, Luckett subsequently entered a guilty plea reserving the right to appeal the District Court\u2019s denial of his motion to dismiss. Luckett timely appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b166-4\">\u00b66 The grant or denial of a motion to dismiss in a criminal proceeding is a question of law which we review to determine whether the district court\u2019s conclusion of law is correct. <em>State v. Trombley, </em>2005 MT 174, \u00b6 5, 327 Mont. 507, \u00b6 5, 116 P.3d 771, \u00b6 5 (citing <em>City of Missoula v. O\u2019Neill, </em>2004 MT 328, \u00b6 5, 324 Mont. 124, \u00b6 5, 102 P.3d 21, \u00b6 5). When the question is one of particularized suspicion, the district court\u2019s determination in that regard is reviewed under the clearly erroneous standard. <em>Trombley, </em>\u00b6 5 (citing <em>State v. Steen, </em>2004 MT 343, \u00b6 5, 324 Mont. 272, \u00b6 5, 102 P.3d 1251, \u00b6 5).</p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b166-6\">\u00b67 <em>Did the District Court err in denying Luckett\u2019s motion to dismiss based on its finding that the arresting officer had particularized suspicion to conduct an investigative stop of Luckett\u2019s vehicle?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b166-7\">\u00b68 Luckett contends that the District Court erred when it denied his motion to dismiss because Deputy Reyna did not possess the necessary particularized suspicion to justify an investigative stop. A peace officer may stop a vehicle that is observed in circumstances that create particularized suspicion that the occupant of the vehicle has committed, is committing, or is about to commit an offense. Section 46-5-401, MCA. To determine whether such particularized suspicion exists, the State must show: (1) objective data from which an experienced officer could make certain inferences, and (2) a resulting suspicion that the occupant of the vehicle in question is or has been engaged in some wrongdoing. State <em>v. Britt, </em>2005 MT 101, \u00b6 8, 327 Mont. 1, \u00b6 8, 111 P.3d 217, \u00b6 8. Whether particularized suspicion exists is a question of fact dependent on the totality of the circumstances surrounding the investigative stop. <em>Britt, </em>\u00b6 8. We evaluate the totality of the circumstances by considering the quantity, or content, and quality, or degree of reliability, of the information available to the officer. <em>Britt, </em>\u00b6 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-8\">\u00b69 The District Court found that Deputy Reyna did have particularized suspicion to stop Luckett\u2019s vehicle and based its finding on the following facts: Deputy Reyna saw Luckett and another man drinking and observed them get into the Crown Victoria. Deputy Reyna then observed Luckett\u2019s slow rate of speed on Interstate 90. Finally, Deputy Reyna observed Luckett weaving on the Interstate and specifically, crossing the fog line on two separate occasions. Based on these facts, the District Court found that Deputy Reyna had particularized suspicion to stop Luckett and investigate his suspicions.</p>\n<p id=\"Ais\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>\u00b610 Luckett makes several generalized arguments. First, Luckett claims he was driving slowly because \u201cwith $3.00 gas many people drive at 50 miles per hour.\u201d Luckett also contends that Deputy Reyna\u2019s stop was a \u201crandom check\u201d for alcohol. Luckett further argues that \u201c[t]here was a vehicle between the officer and Mr. Luckett\u2019s vehicle traveling 50 mph but the officer didn\u2019t stop that one.\u201d Luckett lastly contends that Deputy Reyna\u2019s sole justification for the investigative stop was based on observing Luckett and Creighton drinking beer at the Pelican Truck Stop and thus, Deputy Reyna\u2019s stated reason was merely a pretext to investigate whether Luckett was under the influence of alcohol.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-4\">\u00b611  We note that Luckett fails to ever properly apply the applicable standard as to whether particularized suspicion exists here-that is, the totality of the circumstances surrounding Deputy Reyna\u2019s stop of Luckett\u2019s vehicle. We find nothing in the record to substantiate Luckett\u2019s claims. Rather, it is clear that Deputy Reyna stopped Luckett based on witnessing Luckett and Creighton drinking, the two men subsequently driving away in the Crown Victoria while driving at a noticeably slow rate of speed on Interstate 90, the vehicle weaving along the highway, and the vehicle crossing the fog line. Moreover, Deputy Resma testified that although there was another vehicle between him and the Crown Victoria, he was nevertheless able to fully observe Luckett\u2019s driving. The record further indicates that Deputy Reyna had over four years experience in law enforcement and had completed multiple training sessions through the Montana Law Enforcement Academy, including training in DUI detection. Given the objective data presented by the State through the observations of Deputy Reyna, which gave rise to his suspicions that Luckett was engaged in some wrongdoing, the District Court\u2019s finding that there was particularized suspicion for conducting an investigative stop was not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">\u00b612 In addition to arguing there was no factual basis for a finding of particularized suspicion, Luckett also seeks relief under the holding of <em>State v. Lafferty, </em>1998 MT 247, 291 Mont. 157, 967 P.2d 363, that merely crossing the fog line, on its own, did not support a finding of particularized suspicion. <em>Lafferty, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 17-18. Here-unlike in <em>Lafferty-Deputy </em>Reyna testified, based on his training and experience, that he not only observed Luckett crossing the fog fine, but also driving at an abnormal speed, weaving, and that he had previously witnessed Luckett and Creighton drinking beer. <em>Lafferty </em>is clearly distinguishable.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-6\">\u00b613 Luckett further argues that this case is similar to <em>State v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number><em>Jarman, </em>1998 MT 277, \u00b6\u00b6 15-16, 291 Mont. 391, \u00b6\u00b6 15-16, 967 P.2d 1099, \u00b6\u00b6 15-16, where we held an officer did not have particularized suspicion to conduct an investigative stop of an individual solely based on the officer\u2019s observations of the individual talking on a pay phone on a cold night in a high crime area, driving away, and leaving the pay phone off the hook. We agree with the State that <em>Jarman </em>is distinguishable from the case at bar because in <em>Jarman </em>the behavior the officer observed did not connect the defendant to the crimes the officer suspected. <em>Jarman, </em>\u00b6 15. Here Deputy Reyna\u2019s observations directly connected Luckett to a possible DUI violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-4\">\u00b614 Luckett finally advances <em>State v. Lee, </em>282 Mont. 391, 938 P.2d 637 (1997), for the proposition that an officer\u2019s observation of a vehicle traveling 35 miles per hour in a 70 miles per hour speed zone is insufficient to establish particularized suspicion.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In <em>Lee, </em>we held that information provided by a citizen informant alone, with no other objective data observed by law enforcement, does not support a finding of particularized suspicion. <em>Lee, </em>282 Mont. at 396, 938 P.2d at 640. <em>Lee </em>is clearly not on point with the case at bar as there is no citizen informant here and Deputy Reyna personally observed the events that preceded the investigative stop. Thus, we will not address Luckett\u2019s argument with respect to <em>Lee.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b168-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b168-6\">\u00b615  Although Luckett claimed he was not drinking, Deputy Resma observed Luckett and Creighton drinking beer at the Pelican Truck Stop. Deputy Reyna further watched Luckett and Creighton shortly thereafter drive onto Interstate 90. While on Interstate 90, it is uncontroverted that Luckett was driving abnormally slow for the conditions, crossed the fog line, and was weaving. Accordingly, we hold the District Court\u2019s finding that Deputy Reyna had particularized suspicion to conduct an investigative stop of Luckett\u2019s vehicle was not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-7\">\u00b616 The judgment of the District Court is affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b168-8\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES COTTER, WARNER and MORRIS concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b168-9\"> In his brief, Luckett erroneously claims that <em>Lee </em>involved a 70 miles per hour speed zone. In actuality, <em>Lee </em>involved a 55 miles per hour speed zone. <em>Lee, </em>282 Mont. at 393, 938 P.2d at 639.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
