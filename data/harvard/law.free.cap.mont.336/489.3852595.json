We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-9\">\u00b62 We review whether the District Court correctly denied Iafornaro\u2019s motion to withdraw his plea of nolo contendere?</p>\n<p id=\"b514-10\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b514-11\">\u00b63 The State charged Iafornaro on July 9, 2003, with felony attempted sexual assault for accosting a 15-year-old girl while she was cleaning his motel room. Iafornaro entered a plea of not guilty to the charge and requested that the court order a mental examination to determine his fitness to proceed to trial. The court ordered the mental examination and continued Iafornaro\u2019s trial date.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-12\">\u00b64 The court determined at a hearing on December 23, 2003, that Iafornaro lacked fitness to stand trial. The <em>court </em>committed Iafornaro to the Department of Health and Human Services for as \u201clong as the unfitness endures.\u201d The court held another hearing on March 11,2004, where all parties agreed that Iafornaro was fit to proceed to trial on the felony attempted sexual assault charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-13\">\u00b65 Iafornaro entered into a plea agreement with the State on July 28, 2004. The State agreed to drop Iafornaro\u2019s felony attempted sexual assault charge in exchange for Iafornaro\u2019s plea of nolo contendere to a charge of felony attempted kidnapping. The agreement specified that the State would proceed to trial on the original felony charge of attempted sexual assault if the court declined to accept Iafornaro\u2019s plea of nolo contendere to felony attempted kidnapping. The court accepted Iafomaro\u2019s plea and sentenced Iafornaro on February 8,2005, to Montana State Prison for ten years with no time suspended.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-14\">\u00b66 Iafornaro filed a motion to withdraw bis guilty plea on November 2,2005. Iafornaro argued that the court had failed to inform him of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>\u201clesser included offense of unlawful restraint\u201d when the court accepted his plea of nolo contendere to his charge of felony attempted kidnapping. He contended that his plea was involuntary in light of the court\u2019s omission and his \u201cdocumented history of serious mental illness.\u201d The State responded that the lesser included offense of unlawful restraint was irrelevant to Iafornaro\u2019s decision in light of the fact that he had no possibility of going to trial on the felony attempted kidnapping charge. The State pointed out that Iafornaro\u2019s plea agreement stipulated that the State would proceed to trial on the charge of felony attempted sexual assault if the court did not accept his plea of nolo contendere to felony attempted kidnapping. The court determined that Iafornaro had failed to establish good cause to withdraw his plea. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-4\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">\u00b67 We review Iafornaro\u2019s motion to withdraw his plea of nolo contendere to determine whether his plea was voluntary. <em>State v. Muhammad, </em>2005 MT 234, \u00b6 12, 328 Mont. 397, \u00b6 12, 121 P.3d 521, \u00b6 12. Our determination of whether Iafornaro\u2019s plea was voluntary presents a mixed question of law and fact that we review <em>de novo. Muhammad, </em>\u00b6 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b515-7\">\u00b68 <em>Did the District Court correctly deny Iafornaro\u2019s motion to withdraw his plea of nolo contendere </em>?</p>\n<p id=\"b515-8\">\u00b69 Section 46-16-105(2), MCA, authorizes a district court to permit a defendant to withdraw his plea of nolo contendere upon a showing of \u201cgood cause.\u201d <em>Muhammad, </em>\u00b6 14. Iafornaro argues that the District Court\u2019s failure to inform him that unlawful restraint is a lesser included offense of felony attempted kidnapping constitutes \u201cgood cause.\u201d He suggests that the court\u2019s omission prevented him from entering a \u201cknowing, intelligent and voluntary\u201d plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-9\">\u00b610 Iafornaro cites <em>State v. Sanders, </em>1999 MT 136, 294 Mont. 539, 982 P.2d 1015, and <em>State v. Rave, </em>2005 MT 78, 326 Mont. 398, 109 P.3d 753, for the proposition that a district court\u2019s failure to inform a defendant of an \u201capplicable lesser included offenseG\u201d establishes \u201cgood cause.\u201d The defendants in <em>Sanders </em>and <em>Rave </em>both waived their right to submit an applicable lesser included offense instruction to a jury when they entered guilty pleas pursuant to their respective plea agreements with the State. <em>Sanders, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 <em>4-5; Rave, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 16-17. The courts had not informed the defendants, however, as to what lesser included <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>charges that they would be waiving. <em>Sanders, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 20-21; <em>Rave, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 17-18. The Court determined that these defendants could not have knowingly and intelligently waived their right to convince a jury that they were guilty of a lesser included offense when the defendants had not been informed of what those lesser included offenses might have been. <em>Sanders, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 22-23; <em>Rave, </em>\u00b6 19. The Court held that these defendants had established \u201cgood cause\u201d to withdraw their pleas. <em>Sanders, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 23, 32; <em>Rave, </em>\u00b6 19.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-4\">\u00b611 Iafomaro argues that he also waived his right to submit a lesser included offense instruction to a jury without first being informed of what those lesser included offenses might have been. Iafornaro\u2019s plea agreement stipulated, however, that the State would proceed to trial on the felony attempted sexual assault charge if the court did not accept his plea of nolo contendere to the felony attempted kidnapping charge. Only those lesser included offenses applicable to his charge of felony attempted sexual assault would have been relevant to Iafornaro\u2019s decision. Iafornaro does not allege that the court failed to inform him as to any of the lesser included charges applicable to felony attempted sexual assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">\u00b612  We cannot fault the court or the State for failing to inform Iafomaro of any lesser included offense not relevant to his decision to enter a plea of nolo contendere. Iafornaro had no right to be informed of the possibility of submitting a lesser included offense instruction to the jury when no such possibility existed. <em>State v. Thee, </em>2001 MT 294, \u00b6 24, 307 Mont. 450, \u00b6 24, 37 P.3d 741, \u00b6 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-6\">\u00b613 Iafomaro also argues that his \u201cmental illness and confusion rendered his plea unknowing, unintelligent, and involuntary.\u201d The court took care to ensure, however, that Iafornaro\u2019s mental illness did not interfere with the voluntariness of his plea agreement. The court ordered Iafornaro to be placed in the care of the Department of Health and Human Services on December 23, 2003, until he was deemed fit to proceed. Iafornaro, his doctors, his counsel, and the court later agreed at a hearing on March 11, 2004, that Iafomaro was fit to proceed.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-7\">\u00b614  The record indicates that no omission, misinformation, or mental incapacity hindered Iafornaro\u2019s ability to enter knowingly and intelligently into his plea agreement. The District Court correctly decided that Iafomaro had failed to establish good cause for withdrawing his plea of nolo contendere.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-8\">\u00b615 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b516-9\">JUSTICES LEAPHART, WARNER, COTTER and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
