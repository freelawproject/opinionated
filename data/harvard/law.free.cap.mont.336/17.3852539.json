We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-9\">\u00b62 We restate the issues on appeal as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b42-10\">\u00b63 1. Was St. Germain\u2019s right to be present at all critical stages of his trial violated? '</p>\n<p id=\"b42-12\">\u00b64 2. Did the District Court abuse its discretion in refusing to allow St. Germain\u2019s defense investigator to testify as an expert regarding the victim\u2019s credibility?</p>\n<p id=\"b42-13\">\u00b65 3. Did St. Germain\u2019s trial counsel render ineffective assistance of counsel, depriving him of a fair trial?</p>\n<p id=\"b42-14\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"AB\">\u00b66 H.M. began living with St. Germain and her mother at age seven, shortly after he and her mother married. While living in St. Germain\u2019s household, H.M. was afraid of him and was a constant victim of his discipline. St. Germain disciplined H.M. with grim physical punishment, involving weight training and strenuous exercise. St. Germain further exercised complete emotional control over H.M. through his disciplinary techniques.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-15\">\u00b67 H.M. lived with her mother and St. Germain in both Missoula, Montana, and Butte, Montana, until she was eleven-years-old. While living in Butte, St. Germain had an exercise area in the basement in which H.M. would exercise with him. One day, while in the exercise <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>area, St. Germain instructed H.M. to lie on the floor with her knees up. St. Germain pulled down H.M.\u2019s pants and proceeded to have anal intercourse with H.M. H.M. further recalled having anal intercourse with St. Germain on separate occasions in the back of his van while St. Germain was working as an independent floor installer.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-4\">\u00b68 While later living in Stevensville, Montana, St. Germain performed both digital and anal intercourse upon H.M. Later still while in Stevensville, St. Germain began having vaginal intercourse with H.M., but would still use anal intercourse as a form of punishment.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-5\">\u00b69 At age fourteen, H.M. and her family, including St. Germain, moved to Lost Trail Hot Springs, Montana. H.M. was forced to take showers in the women\u2019s locker room of the hot springs because the trailer the family was living in did not have hot water. On more than one occasion while taking showers at the hot springs, St. Germain would enter the shower and have sexual intercourse with H.M.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-6\">\u00b610 At age sixteen, the family moved to Darby, Montana. While H.M.\u2019s mother would be out of the house, St. Germain would often force H.M. to have sexual intercourse with him. At this point, St. Germain also forced H.M. to perform oral intercourse upon him. St. Germain further performed oral intercourse upon H.M.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-7\">\u00b611 In the end, St. Germain had sexually abused H.M., his stepdaughter, repeatedly between the ages of eleven and nineteen. Additional facts will be discussed where relevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-8\">\u00b612 The State filed an information charging St. Germain with \u201cCharge One\u201d: four counts of incest, all felonies, in violation of \u00a7 45-5-507, MCA; and \u201cCharge Two\u201d: four counts of sexual intercourse without consent, all felonies, in violation of \u00a7 45-5-503, MCA. St. Germain was represented by counsel, Kelli Sather, at all stages of the trial proceedings relevant to this appeal. St. Germain entered pleas of not guilty. A jury trial was held, and the jury found St. Germain guilty on all counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-9\">\u00b613 The District Court sentenced St. Germain to a term of one-hundred years, with twenty-five years suspended to be served at the Montana State Prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-10\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b43-11\">\u00b614  Whether a criminal defendant\u2019s right to be present at the critical stages of his or her trial has been violated is a question of constitutional law, and our review of questions of constitutional law is plenary. <em>State v. McCarthy, </em>2004 MT 312, \u00b6 29, 324 Mont. 1, \u00b6 29, 101 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>P.3d 288, \u00b6 29. A district court is vested with broad discretion in ruling on the admissibility of expert testimony, and without a showing of abuse of discretion, the district court\u2019s ruling will not be disturbed on appeal. <em>State v. Riggs, </em>2005 MT 124, \u00b6 18, 327 Mont. 196, \u00b6 18, 113 P.3d 281, \u00b6 18; <em>State v. Crawford, </em>2003 MT 118, \u00b6 30, 315 Mont. 480, \u00b6 30, 68 P.3d 848, \u00b6 30; <em>State v. Hocevar, </em>2000 MT 157, \u00b6 54, 300 Mont. 167, \u00b6 54, 7 P.3d 329, \u00b6 54. Claims of ineffective assistance of counsel present mixed questions of law and fact that we review de novo. <em>State v. Novak, </em>2005 MT 294, \u00b6 15, 329 Mont. 309, \u00b6 15, 124 P.3d 182, \u00b6 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"AL\">Issue 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-5\">\u00b615 Was <em>St. Germain\u2019s right to be present at all critical stages of his trial violated?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b44-6\">\u00b616 St. Germain alleges his constitutional right to be present at all critical stages of his trial was violated when the District Court did not advise him of his right to question jurors regarding alleged conversations taking place between jurors, witnesses, and spectators to the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-7\">\u00b617 The background to St. Germain\u2019s claims is as follows: On the second day of the trial, the parties met in chambers where defense counsel brought to the District Court\u2019s attention that Juror No. 7 had been seen speaking with H.M.\u2019s biological father in the hallway next to the courtroom. St. Germain was present during the in-chambers discussion. H.M.\u2019s father was not a witness in the trial, and the State\u2019s counsel expressed to the District Court that he would inform H.M.\u2019s father to not have any sort of conversation with any of the jurors. The District Court was satisfied with this suggestion, defense counsel did not object, and the trial proceeded.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-8\">\u00b618 On the third day of trial in another in-chambers discussion, defense counsel again expressed concern that a lot of talk was going on in the hallways concerning the case and also, that the bailiff was speaking to a juror. The District Court then asked both defense counsel and St. Germain if they wanted to question the bailiff on the record concerning what had taken place. Both St. Germain and his defense counsel responded negatively. Defense counsel did, however, request the District Court to caution the jury regarding the conversations allegedly taking place. The District Comb did so, instructing as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b44-9\">All right. Before we begin, I would just like to mention again there\u2019s been some concern about witnesses and parties and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>attorneys and jurors mingling in our small area up here. I just want to emphasize again the need to be careful about talking to anybody who could be involved in the case or saying anything, even if it\u2019s innocent. If somebody sees something or hears something, they might get suspicious about it even if it is innocent. I would ask everybody to be poker-faced and quiet around participants. I would appreciate it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b45-4\">Despite the cautionary instruction, defense counsel moved for a mistrial based on the hallway conversations and because witnesses allegedly had been speaking to each other regarding the case. The District Court denied the motion and proceeded with the trial. The District Court did not advise St. Germain he had any right to call Juror No. 7 into chambers to discuss any alleged conversations that took place and defense counsel did not make such an argument at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"Af\">\u00b619 The federal constitutional right to be present at all criminal proceedings is one of the most basic rights contained in the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment of the United States Constitution. <em>Illinois v. Allen, </em>397 U.S. 337, 338, 90 S. Ct. 1057, 1058 (1970). In Montana, the right of a criminal defendant to be present at his trial is expressly guaranteed by the Montana Constitution: \u201cIn all criminal prosecutions the accused shall have the right to appear and defend in person and by counsel...\u201d Mont. Const. art. II, \u00a7 24. This Court recognized as early as 1922, when interpreting an identical provision of the 1889 Montana Constitution, that \u201cthe defendant must be present throughout the <em>entire </em>trial.\u201d <em>State v. Reed, </em>65 Mont. 51, 56, 210 P. 756, 757 (1922) (emphasis added). This Court stated in <em>Reed:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"AJ\">No principle of law, relating to criminal procedure, is better settled than that, in felony cases, nothing should be done in the absence of the prisoner. It is his unquestioned right \u201cto be confronted with his accusers and witnesses.\u201d He has the legal right to be present when the jury are hearing his case, and at all times during the proceeding of the trial, when anything is done which in any manner affects his right...\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b45-5\"><em>Reed, </em>65 Mont. at 58, 210 P. at 758 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b45-6\">\u00b620 St. Germain urges us to apply our holding in <em>State v. Bird, </em>2002 MT 2, 308 Mont. 75, 43 P.3d 266, to the facts herein. <em>Bird </em>involved a criminal trial where Bird, the defendant, was charged with partner or family member assault. At the trial, before <em>voir dire </em>began, the district court allowed the State to conduct individual <em>voir dire </em>examinations in the court\u2019s chambers of any prospective juror who had previous experience with domestic violence. During these examinations, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>prosecutor and defense counsel were in attendance, but the defendant was not. <em>Bird, </em>\u00b6 12. Neither the district court, the prosecutor, or defense counsel informed the defendant that \u201che had a constitutional right to be present during the individual questioning of the jurors.\u201d Further, the district court did not allow the defendant the opportunity to choose to participate in the individual <em>voir dire </em>and thus, the defendant was not afforded the chance to voluntarily, intelligently, and knowingly waive his right to be present. <em>Bird, </em>\u00b6 37.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-4\">\u00b621 On appeal, we held that a trial court must explain to the defendant, on the record, his or her constitutional right to be present at all critical stages of the trial, including in-chambers individual <em>voir dire. </em>Further, we held that \u201cif a defendant chooses to waive that right, the court must obtain an on-the-record personal waiver by the defendant acknowledging that the defendant voluntarily, intelligently and knowingly waives that right.\u201d <em>Bird, </em>\u00b6 38.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-5\">\u00b622 The State contends that St. Germain was present at every stage of his trial. The State points out that St. Germain was an active participant in the chamber discussions regarding Juror No. 7 and felt comfortable speaking up during other chamber discussions. Further, the State asserts that St. Germain is seeking his constitutional right to be present for stages of the trial that did not take place and thus, there is no merit to his argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-6\">\u00b623 St. Germain argues the District Court should have advised him he had a right to call Juror No. 7 into chambers to inquire into the contents of the conversation between the juror and the victim\u2019s father. St. Germain attempts to apply the holding of Bird-that a trial court must advise the defendant of his or her constitutional right to be present at all critical stages of the trial-to a situation where the stage of the trial never actually took place, but merely, in St. Germain\u2019s opinion, <em>should have </em>taken place. We agree with the State that St. Germain cannot claim his constitutional right to be present at all critical stages of the trial was infringed at a stage that never occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"ACL\">\u00b624  We conclude that St. Germain\u2019s right to be present at all critical stages of his trial was not violated. Because St. Germain was present at every stage of his trial, there is no basis to grant him relief on federal or state constitutional grounds because the right he now asserts is premised on stages of the trial that never occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-7\">Issue 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-8\">\u00b625 <em>Did the District Court abuse its discretion in refusing to allow St. Germain\u2019s defense investigator to testify as an expert </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number><em>regarding the victim\u2019s credibility?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b47-4\">\u00b626 During St. Germain\u2019s defense, defense counsel attempted to call Ron Maki, St. Germain\u2019s investigator, as a witness. Defense counsel explained the purpose of Maki\u2019s testimony in response to the State\u2019s objection as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b47-5\">I\u2019m not going to ask him anything specific about \u2014 I\u2019m not going to ask [Maki], you know, any specifics that [H.M.] told him. He interviewed her . . . [h]e can testify to her demeanor, what she was like during the interview and if he thought she was credible or not.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b47-6\">The District Court ruled that Maki could not comment on H.M.\u2019s credibility as the question of credibility was for only the jury to decide. The District Court informed defense counsel that Maki could testify to any prior statements made to him that were inconsistent with her trial testimony provided H.M. had the opportunity to review the alleged inconsistent statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-7\">\u00b627 The credibility of a witness lies exclusively within the province of the trier of fact. In this regard, \u201cwe generally will not allow an expert witness to comment on the credibility of the alleged victim.\u201d <em>State v. Hensley, 250 </em>Mont. 478, 481, 821 P.2d 1029, 1031 (1991). Expert testimony is admissible, however, for the purpose of helping the jury to assess the credibility of a child sexual assault complainant under certain circumstances. <em>State v. Geyman, </em>224 Mont. 194, 729 P.2d 475 (1986). In <em>Geyman, </em>we created a narrow exception to the general rule that the credibility of \"witnesses is the exclusive province of the jury in criminal trials. <em>Riggs, </em>\u00b6 21 (citing <em>Geyman, </em>224 Mont. at 200, 729 P.2d at 479). We reasoned that an adult\u2019s reaction to being sexually assaulted is likely to be within reach of the jury\u2019s empathic imagination, so as to enable the jury to assess the complainant\u2019s truthfulness. A child\u2019s emotional reactions to such abuse, on the other hand, especially given the circumstances in which the child may find herself, and the familial relation that she may have to the alleged abuser, are likely to be outside the ken of the jury, which may find those reactions mystifying without the guidance of expert testimony. <em>Riggs, </em>\u00b6 21; <em>Geyman, </em>224 Mont. at 196-201, 729 P.2d at 477-80. The <em>Geyman </em>rule was restated in <em>State v. Harris, </em>247 Mont. 405, 410, 808 P.2d 453, 455 (1991), as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b47-8\">In cases involving sexual abuse of a minor child, we will allow expert testimony on the credibility of the alleged victim. This exception applies, however, only when the victim testifies at trial, and credibility is brought into question.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b48-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>(Internal citations omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b48-4\">\u00b628 St. Germain argues the <em>Geyman </em>exception should be applied to the facts herein in order to protect his due process rights. Specifically, St. Germain claims that Maki should have been allowed to testify regarding H.M.\u2019s credibility, despite the fact that H.M. made her accusations against St. Germain as an adult and testified against St.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Germain as an adult. St. Germain asserts that Maki\u2019s testimony| regarding H.M.\u2019s credibility was the only way he could rebut witnesses\u2019 testimony regarding their observations of St. Germain. The State responds that St. Germain was free to bolster his own credibility and attack H.M.\u2019s credibility at all points throughout the trial, but was not entitled the use of expert testimony to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-5\">\u00b629 Our past cases in which we allowed expert testimony as to the credibility of a child sexual abuse victim involved young children. <em>Geyman </em>involved the testimony of a nine-year-old sexual abuse victim who testified at trial against the accused. <em>Geyman, </em>224 Mont. at 195, 729 P.2d at 476. <em>Geyman </em>was followed by <em>State v. French, </em>233 Mont. 364, 760 P.2d 86 (1988), where a school counselor testified as to the credibility of an eight-year-old sexual abuse victim. Later, expert testimony was admitted to address the credibility of a six-year-old sexual abuse victim in <em>State v. Hall, </em>244 Mont. 161, 797 P.2d 183 (1990), and a nine-year-old sexual abuse victim in <em>State v. McLain, </em>249 Mont. 242, 815 P.2d 147 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b48-6\">\u00b630 Although not cited by the parties herein, the <em>Hensley </em>case is particularly instructive. In <em>Hensley, </em>we were faced with the issue of whether expert testimony as to the credibility of an alleged child sexual abuse victim who was one month shy of seventeen years of age was admissible. In citing to a decision by the Court of Appeals of Wisconsin, <em>State v. Haseltine, </em>352 N.W.2d 673 (Wis. App. 1984), we reasoned that \u201c[n]o witness, expert or otherwise, should be permitted to give an opinion that another mentally and physically competent witness is telling the truth.\u201d <em>Hensley, </em>250 Mont. at 482, 821 P.2d at 1031. This Court held <em>in. Hensley </em>that because the alleged victim was sixteen years old, was a competent witness, and had no physical or mental disability, that a jury was capable of assessing the credibility of the alleged victim. As such, expert testimony was not admissible as to the credibility of the alleged victim, despite the fact the alleged victim was under the age of eighteen, the age of majority. <em>Hensley, </em>250 Mont. at 482, 821 P.2d at 1032.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-7\">\u00b631  H.M. was nineteen years old when she initially made her accusations against St. Germain, and was twenty years old at the time <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>of trial. Although a majority of the sexual abuse had occurred when H.M. was a minor child, there is nothing in the record to indicate that H.M. was not competent to testify or that she was under some sort of physical or mental disability. Thus, facts supporting exclusion of the expert testimony are more compelling here than in <em>Hensley. </em>Because H.M. was twenty years old at the time of trial, and there was no evidence of any physical or mental disability, the jury was capable of assessing her credibility without the assistance of expert testimony. We conclude the District Court did not abuse its discretion in excluding the testimony of Maki, as to H.M.\u2019s credibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-4\">Issue 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-5\">\u00b632 <em>DidSt. Germain\u2019s trial counsel render ineffective assistance of counsel, depriving him of a fair trial?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b49-6\">\u00b633 Article II, Section 24, of the Montana Constitution and the Sixth Amendment of the United States Constitution guarantee a person the right to the effective assistance of counsel. This Court had adopted the two-pronged test of <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 104 S. Ct. 2052 (1984), to evaluate claims of ineffective assistance of counsel. The defendant must demonstrate (1) that his counsel\u2019s performance fell below the range of competence required of attorneys in criminal cases and (2) that his counsel\u2019s deficient performance prejudiced his case. <em>State v. Hendricks, </em>2003 MT 223, \u00b6 6, 317 Mont. 177, \u00b6 6, 75 P.3d 1268, \u00b6 6. The first prong carries a strong presumption in favor of the State, as counsel possesses a wide latitude in determining what tactics to employ when defending a client. <em>State v. Kougl, </em>2004 MT 243, \u00b6 11, 323 Mont. 6, \u00b6 11, 97 P.3d 1095, \u00b6 11. The defendant bears the burden to show that his counsel\u2019s performance fell below an objective standard of reasonableness. <em>State v. Grixti, </em>2005 MT 296, \u00b6 25, 329 Mont. 330, \u00b6 25, 124 P.3d 177, \u00b6 25.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-7\">\u00b634 St. Germain asserts several grounds for concluding defense counsel provided ineffective assistance. Before ruling on whether St. Germain has satisfied the two prongs of <em>Strickland </em>we must first determine if this direct appeal is the proper forum in which to do so. Generally, in addressing ineffective assistance of counsel claims, we ask \u201cwhy\u201d counsel did or did not perform as alleged and then seek to answer the question by reference to the record. <em>Kougl, </em>\u00b6 14 (citing <em>State v. White, </em>2001 MT 149, \u00b6 20, 306 Mont. 58, \u00b6 20, 30 P.3d 340, \u00b6 20). If the record on appeal explains \u201cwhy,\u201d we will then address the issue on appeal. If the claim is based on matters outside the record on appeal, we will refuse to address the claim and allow the defendant to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>file a postconviction proceeding where a record can be developed as to \u201cwhy\u201d counsel acted as alleged, thus allowing the court to determine whether counsel\u2019s performance was ineffective or merely a tactical decision. <em>Kougl, </em>\u00b6 14; <em>White, </em>\u00b6 20. Generally, counsel\u2019s failure to adequately investigate, or failure to prepare a defense, or failure to familiarize him or herself with critical areas of the applicable law are non-record based areas of representation. <em>White, </em>\u00b6 18 (citations omitted). An exception to the requirement for a record-based answer as to why counsel acted or failed to act arises where no plausible justification exists to counter a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel on appeal. <em>Kougl, </em>\u00b6 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-4\">\u00b635 Failure to object to testimony may be record-based and thus appropriate for direct appeal, <em>State v. Notti, </em>2003 MT 296, \u00b6 8, 318 Mont. 146, \u00b6 8, 79 P.3d 289, \u00b6 8, but commonly the record does not reflect counsel\u2019s reasons for failing to object. <em>See State v. Upshaw, </em>2006 MT 341, \u00b6 33, 335 Mont. 162, \u00b6 33, 153 P.3d 579, \u00b6 33 (citing <em>State v. Dyfort, </em>2000 MT 338, \u00b6 11, 303 Mont. 153, \u00b6 11, 15 P.3d 464, \u00b6 11). If the record does not fully explain why counsel failed to object to the admission of evidence, the matter is best suited for postconviction proceedings. <em>Notti, </em>\u00b6 8. For instance, decisions regarding the number and timing of objections lie within counsel\u2019s tactical discretion, which would indicate that non-record based information explaining the tactics may be involved, and thus should be barred from record-based review. <em>White, </em>\u00b6 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-5\">\u00b636 Applying the foregoing to the case at bar, we examine each of St. Germain\u2019s allegations individually.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-6\">a. Failure to Attack H. M.\u2019s Credibility</p>\n<p id=\"b50-7\">\u00b637 St. Germain first argues that defense counsel was \u201cobviously unaware\u201d of the law concerning the admissibility of the proposed expert testimony of Maki and that it was \u201cevident\u201d defense counsel had not properly researched the issue. St. Germain bases this conclusion on the fact that defense counsel made no argument regarding <em>Geyman </em>in an attempt to prove Maki\u2019s testimony was admissible. St. Germain concludes that he was left without a defense at trial because defeating H.M.\u2019s credibility and the credibility of other State witnesses would ultimately be his only defense. However, because we have already concluded that the Geyman-type evidence offered by the defendant was properly excluded by the District Court, this issue cannot serve as a basis for concluding there was ineffective assistance of counsel, and we need not address it further.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-8\">b. Failure to Establish H.M.\u2019s Prior Inconsistent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>Statements</p>\n<p id=\"b51-4\">\u00b638 St. Germain next argues that defense counsel inadequately handled the issue of alleged prior inconsistent statements made by H.M., specifically, that defense counsel failed to elicit from H.M. prior inconsistent statements she made to Maki. St. Germain notes that the District Court was forced to explain the rules of prior inconsistent statements to defense counsel. St. Germain further argues that releasing certain of the State\u2019s witnesses and H.M. from their subpoenas, along with the alleged failure to elicit prior inconsistent statements from H.M., are demonstrations of the lack of preparation for trial by defense counsel on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-5\">\u00b639 The State argues there is nothing in the record that reveals H.M. actually made statements to Maki that were inconsistent with her trial testimony and that if these statements do indeed exist, they are not part of the record herein. The State argues that defense counsel was able to successfully admit evidence regarding certain of H.M.\u2019s prior statements, including a letter written to a former boyfriend from which defense counsel was able to elicit testimony on rebuttal from H.M. that showed inconsistencies in her trial testimony regarding the time period H.M. lived at Lost Trail Hot Springs.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-6\">\u00b640 From the record, we note that after the District Court explained the use of prior inconsistent statements to defense counsel, defense counsel was allowed to recall H.M. to the witness stand in an attempt to elicit such a statement. Thus, it appears that the District Court cured any lack of understanding defense counsel had about procedures or her release of H.M. from her subpoena. However, during her examination of H.M., defense counsel was not able to elicit any prior inconsistent statements made to Maki, and thus, perhaps the statements did not exist. At the very least, these statements do not exist in the record, making the existence of such inconsistent statements a non-record issue. Therefore, we conclude that a postconviction relief hearing would be the appropriate remedy, so that a proper record can be made.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-7\">c. Failure to Object to Other Crimes Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"Aj7\">\u00b641 Lastly, St. Germain challenges a miscellany of trial issues which he claims were the improper introduction of other crimes or wrongs evidence admitted because of the ineffective assistance of defense <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>counsel.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b52-4\">\u00b642 St. Germain alleges that defense counsel failed to object to a \u201cplethora\u201d of evidence introduced by the State regarding alleged sexual assaults against H.M. prior to and after the charges designated in the information, and also failed to object to evidence concerning physical assaults inflicted by St. Germain upon H.M., her best friend, and her half-brother during St. Germain\u2019s martial arts exercises. However, the record here does not explain the reasons for defense counsel\u2019s failure to object to this evidence. As noted above, decisions regarding the number and timing of objections generally lie within counsel\u2019s tactical discretion, making it necessary for non-record based information to explain the decisions made by counsel during trial. As result, we cannot entertain St. Germain\u2019s argument on appeal. <em>Novak, </em>\u00b6 20; <em>White, </em>\u00b6 16. A postconviction proceeding would allow counsel to explain her decisions entirely.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-5\">\u00b643  St. Germain argues that defense counsel could have raised a double jeopardy issue regarding whether incest is a lessor included offense of sexual intercourse without consent, but because defense counsel did not argue this point at trial, St. Germain contends it is now lost for appeal. St. Germain also argues that defense counsel failed to call a witness with \u201cvaluable knowledge\u201d concerning H.M., her best friend, and St. Germain himself. As the record is completely silent regarding defense counsel\u2019s reasons for either not making the double jeopardy argument or failing to call other witnesses to testify, we would need to speculate as to the reasons for those decisions, and conclude that these issues are better examined within a postconviction relief proceeding. <em>Novak, </em>\u00b6 20; <em>Hendricks, </em>\u00b6 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-6\">\u00b644 The judgment of the District Court is affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b52-7\">JUSTICES COTTER, LEAPHART, WARNER and NELSON concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b52-8\"> St. Germain also asserts within his briefing the District Court erred in allowing testimony regarding his use of marijuana, but fails to relate that argument to the issue he has raised-that is, whether defense counsel\u2019s alleged failure to object to other crimes evidence constitutes ineffective assistance of counsel. M. R. App. P. 23(a)(4) requires a party to argue \u201cthe contentions of the appellant with respect to the issues presented, and the reasons therefore, with citations to the authorities, statutes and pages of the record relied on.\u201d St. Germain does not raise this as a separate issue or present an argument in support of his assertion that the District Court erred. \u201cUnder Rule 23, M.R.App.P., it is not this Court\u2019s obligation to conduct legal research on appellant\u2019s behalf, to guess as to his precise position, or to develop legal analysis that may lend support to his position.\u201d <em>In re Estate of Bayers, </em>1999 MT 154, \u00b6 19, 295 Mont. 89, \u00b6 19, 983 P.2d 339, \u00b6 19. Therefore, we will not address whether the District Court erred by allowing testimony regarding St. Germain\u2019s use of marijuana.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
