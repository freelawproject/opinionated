Defendant Steve Kaste (Kaste) does not join this appeal. We affirm in part and reverse in part.</p>\n<p id=\"AjX\">\u00b62 The Boettchers present the following issues for appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b418-9\">\u00b63 1. Whether \u00a7 33-10-110, MCA, grants MIGA immunity from liability arising out of statutory and common law claims of bad faith.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-10\">\u00b64 2. Whether \u00a7 33-10-110, MCA, extends immunity to Western Guaranty and Reed for statutory and common law claims of bad faith.</p>\n<p id=\"ABE\">\u00b65 3. Whether \u00a7 33-10-110, MCA, violates substantive due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-11\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b418-12\">\u00b66 William Brian Boettcher fell from a loft and shattered both heels while painting Kaste\u2019s commercial building on July 26, 2001. Legion Insurance Company (Legion) insured Kaste at the time of the accident with a $1 million policy for commercial auto and properly coverage. The Boettchers filed claims against the Legion policy seeking compensation for their injuries. Legion became insolvent before resolving the Boettchers\u2019 claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-13\">\u00b67 The Boettchers\u2019 claims transferred to MIGA upon Legion\u2019s insolvency. The Boettchers improperly refer to MIGA as the Montana Guaranty Fund in the caption of their appeal. MIGA is the nonprofit association of insurance companies statutorily created to provide a mechanism for payment of covered claims to avoid financial loss to claimants or policyholders because of the insolvency of an insurer. Western Guaranty is a nonprofit organization that performs claims <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>handling for MIGA. Reed worked for Western Guaranty and handled the Boettchers\u2019 claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-3\">\u00b68 The Boettchers filed a complaint for declaratory relief in the Eighth Judicial District, Cascade County on January 10, 2005. The Boettchers allege that MIGA, Western Guaranty, and Reed faded to settle their claims in a reasonable manner. The Boettchers requested that the District Court issue a declaratory ruling that: 1) MIGA has all the rights, duties, and obligations of the insolvent insurer including statutory and common law obligations of good faith owed to an insured and to a third party under the Montana Insurance Guaranty Association Act (the Act); 2) the limitation of liability afforded MIGA under the Act applies only to its obligations within the policy limits of the insolvent insurer and not to the \u201cextra-contractual\u201d liability involving violations of statutory and common law principles of good faith and fair dealing; 3) statutory or common law limitations of liability do not extend to any entity or person hired to administer claims on behalf of MIGA; and 4) any immunity from any \u201cextra-contractual\u201d liability granted to MIGA violates equal protection and due process under the state and federal constitutions. MIGA, Western Guaranty, and Reed denied the Boettchers\u2019 claims for declaratory relief in an answer filed on February 25, 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-4\">\u00b69 The Boettchers filed a motion for summary judgment on July 22, 2005, specifically challenging \u00a7 33-10-110, MCA, the statute that insulates MIGA from any liability relating to acts performed within its duties. MIGA, Western Guaranty, and Reed also filed a motion for summary judgment on July 25, 2005. The Boettchers acknowledged that they had received the statutory maximum claim of $300,000 allowed under MIGA. They argued, however, that Montana law entitled them to pursue recovery of the expenses that they incurred in forcing MIGA, Western Guaranty, and Reed to pay the $300,000. The Boettchers asserted that MIGA, Western Guaranty, and Reed withheld payment and caused a two-year delay and unnecessary litigation in settling their claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">\u00b610 The District Court granted summary judgment in favor of MIGA, Western Guaranty, and Reed. The court concluded that MIGA\u2019s rights, duties, and responsibilities extend only to \u201ccovered claims,\u201d not including statutory and common law obligations of good faith owed to an insured and a third-party claimant. The court determined that the 2001 version of \u00a7 33-10-110, MCA, protected MIGA from statutory and common law good faith and fair dealing claims and that such immunity extended to Western Guaranty and Reed for acts performed on behalf of MIGA. The court concluded that the immunity statute does not violate substantive due process rights under the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution or Article II, Section 4, of the Montana Constitution. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>Boettchers appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-4\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">\u00b611 We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment. <em>Petroleum Tank Release v. Capitol Indem., </em>2006 MT 133, \u00b6 12, 332 Mont. 352, \u00b6 12, 137 P.3d 522, \u00b6 12. If no genuine issue of material fact exists, we determine whether the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>Petroleum Tank Release, </em>\u00b6 12. Accordingly, we review the district court\u2019s legal determinations to establish whether the conclusions were correct. <em>Petroleum Tank Release, </em>\u00b6 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b420-7\">\u00b612 <em>Whether \u00a7 33-10-110, MCA, grants MIGA immunity from liability arising out of statutory and common law claims of bad faith.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b420-8\">\u00b613 The Boettchers concede that \u00a7 33-10-110, MCA, cloaks MIGA with immunity from liability arising out of actions taken in the performance of its powers and duties. The Boettchers argue that MIGA acted outside of its statutory duty in failing to reasonably settle their claims, and thus the immunity provision cannot protect MIGA from liability arising out of bad faith claims. The Boettchers contend that \u00a7 33-10-105(l)(b), MCA, implicitly requires MIGA to settle claims reasonably under the Unfair Trade Practices Act (U'i'PA), embodied in Title 33, Chapter 18, MCA. The Boettchers argue that any breach of that duty gives rise to both a common law cause of action for bad faith and a statutory cause of action under \u00a7 33-18-242, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-9\">The Act (2001) versus the Act (2005)</p>\n<p id=\"b420-10\">\u00b614 As a preliminary matter, we must determine whether to apply the 2001 version of the Act or the amended 2005 version. We determine the substantive rights between the parties according to the law in effect at the date of injury. <em>Anderson v. Werner Enterprises, Inc., </em>1998 MT 333, \u00b6 28, 292 Mont. 284, \u00b6 28, 972 P.2d 806, \u00b6 28. The Boettchers urge us to apply the 2001 version of the Act, because the claims handling practices in question occurred before the Legislature amended the Act on March 18, 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-11\">\u00b615 MIGA concedes that the 2001 version of the Act constituted the law at the time of Boettcher\u2019s underlying injury related to his fall from the loft. MIGA argues nevertheless that the 2005 version of the Act should govern any potential third party claims that the Boettchers may have against MIGA. MIGA bases its contention on the fact that the underlying claim settled on October 6, 2005, when the parties executed an assignment of claims document. MIGA contends that the October settlement signified the proper time for filing a third party action under \u00a7 33-18-242(6), MCA, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>and, therefore, the law in effect at the time that the claims could be filed under the UTPA should control which version of the Act applies to the Boettchers\u2019 claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-3\">\u00b616 MIGA\u2019s position disregards our longstanding rule, however, to apply the law in effect at the date of the injury. <em>Anderson, </em>\u00b6 28. For purposes of the Boettchers\u2019 potential common law bad faith claim, the alleged tortious conduct began when MIGA, Western Guaranty, and Reed handled and supposedly unreasonably rejected the Boettchers\u2019 first demand for payment. All elements of the tort existed upon the alleged unreasonable refusal to pay. <em>Brewington v. Employers Fire Insurance Co., </em>1999 MT 312, \u00b6 29, 297 Mont. 243, \u00b6 29, 992 P.2d 237, \u00b6 29.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-4\">\u00b617 Similar reasoning applies to the Boettchers\u2019 potential statutory bad faith claim pursuant to the UTPA. The injuries in this case, if any, took place when MIGA, Western Guaranty, and Reed failed to handle the Boettchers\u2019 claims in a reasonable manner. Section 33-18-242(1), MCA. This first alleged failure took place when the Boettchers made a demand for payment from MIGA before the Legislature amended the Act in 2005. Any claim processing restrictions imposed under \u00a7 33-18-242(6)(b), MCA, do not alter the fact that the Boettchers\u2019 alleged injuries in this case occurred when MIGA, Western Guaranty, and Reed handled and allegedly unreasonably rejected the Boettchers\u2019 demands for payment. These alleged injuries occurred when the 2001 Act controlled.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-5\">\u00b618  The Boettchers further contend that \u00a7 33-10-110, MCA, as amended in 2005, contains no express provision on retroactivity and, therefore, the amended statute can be applied only prospectively. We will not apply a statute retroactively unless the Legislature clearly expresses its intention of such retroactive application. <em>Anderson, </em>\u00b6 28. Nothing in the face of the 2005 version of \u00a7 33-10-110, MCA, indicates that the Legislature intended for the amended statute to be applied retroactively. We apply the 2001 version of the Act in light of the fact that the Boettchers\u2019 alleged injuries occurred before the Legislature enacted the 2005 amendments.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-6\">Application of the Act (2001)</p>\n<p id=\"b421-7\">\u00b619 We consider whether \u00a7 33-10-110, MCA (2001), grants MIGA immunity from bad faith claims. We seek to implement the objectives that the Legislature sought to achieve in interpreting statutes. <em>Mont. for Justice v. State ex. rel. McGrath, </em>2006 MT 277, \u00b6 60, 334 Mont. 237, \u00b6 60, 146 P.3d 759, \u00b6 60. The plain language of the statute controls our interpretation if the legislative intent can be determined from the plain meaning of the words used. <em>Mont. for Justice, </em>\u00b6 60. We must \u201cinterpret individual sections of an act in such a manner as to ensure coordination with the other sections of the <em>act.\u201d Howell v. State, </em>263 Mont. 275, 286, 868 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>P.2d 568, 574 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b422-4\">\u00b620 Section 33-10-110, MCA, provides that there is no liability on the part of, and that no cause of action of any nature may be brought against \u201cany member insurer, the association or its insurance producers or employees, the board of directors, or the commissioner or his representatives...\u201d This immunity applies to \u201cany action taken by them in the performance of their powers and duties under this part.\u201d Section 33-10-110, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-5\">\u00b621 We considered in Howell, 263 Mont. at 286, 868 P.2d at 575, whether MIGA enjoyed immunity under \u00a7 33-10-110, MCA (2001), from a claim of attorney fees. We determined that the statute on its face could be read to insulate MIGA from \u201cany liability,\u201d including MIGA\u2019s statutory obligation to pay \u201ccovered claims\u201d under \u00a7 33-10-105, MCA. We declined to apply the provision so broadly, however, in light of the Act\u2019s primary purpose of \u201cavoiding financial loss to claimants or policyholders by the insolvency of an insurer...\u201d <em>Howell, </em>263 Mont. at 287, 868 P.2d at 575; <em>See </em>\u00a7 33-10-101, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-6\">\u00b622 We determined that MIGA maintained a statutory duty to pay only \u201ccovered claims\u201d under \u00a7 33-10-105, MCA. <em>Howell, </em>263 Mont. at 287, 868 P.2d at 575. A \u201ccovered claim\u201d means \u201can unpaid claim, including one for unearned premiums, that arises out of and is within the coverage and not in excess of the applicable limits of an insurance policy to which this part applies ...\u201d Section 33-10-102(2)(a), MCA. We concluded that the Legislature, by enacting \u00a7 33-10-110, MCA (2001), intended to preclude liability against MIGA for claims other than \u201ccovered claims,\u201d such as claims for attorney fees. <em>Howell, </em>263 Mont. at 287, 868 P.2d at 575.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-7\">\u00b623 The Boettchers attempt to distinguish <em>Howell </em>by arguing that the Court addressed only attorney fees and not claims of bad faith. The Boettchers ignore the fact that, in deciding to preclude an action against MIGA for recovery of attorney fees, we relied on the reasoning in decisions from four other states that prevented bad faith actions against an insurance guaranty association. <em>Howell, </em>263 Mont. at 287-88, 868 P.2d at 575-76.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-8\">\u00b624 For instance, we considered a Missouri appellate court\u2019s decision in <em>Pannell v. Missouri Ins. Guar. Ass\u2019n, </em>595 S.W.2d 339 (Mo. App. 1980), to preclude a \u201cvexatious refusal to pay\u201d action against the Missouri Insurance Guaranty Association based on a similar statutory immunity provision and the guaranty association\u2019s authority to pay only covered claims. <em>Howell, </em>263 Mont. at 287, 868 <em>P.2d </em>at 575. We cited a Washington decision that concluded that bad faith did not constitute a covered claim and, therefore, the guaranty association could not be held liable for such damages. <em>Howell, </em>263 Mont. at 287, 868 P.2d at 575, citing <em>Vaughn v. Vaughn, </em>597 P.2d 932 (Wash. App. 1979). We also looked to <em>Isaacson v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number><em>California Ins. Guaranty Ass\u2019n, </em>750 P.2d 297 (Cal. 1988), wherein the Supreme Court of California held that the insurance guaranty association stands in the shoes of the insolvent insurer only to the extent of covered claims and not tort claims relating to claims handling practices. <em>Howell, </em>263 Mont. at 288, 868 P.2d at 575. Based on the reasoning of those cases, we concluded in <em>Howell </em>that MIGA could not be held hable for claims that do not constitute a \u201ccovered claim\u201d under \u00a7 33-10-102, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-4\">\u00b625 The Boettchers urge the Court to limit, the holding in <em>Howell </em>as simply excluding claims for attorney fees from a \u201ccovered claim.\u201d They urge us instead to adopt the reasoning in <em>Washington Ins. Guar. Assn. v. Ramsey, </em>922 P.2d 237 (Alaska 1996), for bad faith claims against MIGA. The Alaska Supreme Court in <em>Ramsey </em>determined that Washington Insurance Guaranty Association (WIGA) did not enjoy immunity from bad faith liability under the Washington immunity provision, because its failure to settle a claim in good faith constituted an action outside of its statutory duiy. <em>Ramsey, </em>922 P.2d at 243. The <em>Ramsey </em>court reasoned that if WIGA maintained the statutory duty to settle claims reasonably, then \u201csuch a refusal is not in accordance with WIGA\u2019s statutory duties, and therefore WIGA cannot claim immunity from liability based on that refusal.\u201d <em>Ramsey, </em>922 P.2d at 243.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">\u00b626 MIGA counters that we should reject the <em>Ramsey </em>decision based on our decision in <em>Howell </em>and the reasoning of <em>Hudson Environmental v. NJ PLIGA, </em>858 A.2d 39 (N. J. Super. 2004), and <em>Bills v. Arizona Prop. and Cas. Ins. Guaranty Fund, </em>984 P.2d 574 (Ariz. App. 1999). The New Jersey court in <em>Hudson </em>faced the same question presented here: whether the immunity provision contained in the state\u2019s insurance guaranty association act precluded bad faith actions against the insurance guaranty association. The court rejected the Alaska court\u2019s \u201cnarrow\u201d reading of the immunity provision, stating that such interpretation \u201cturns the immunity provision into a sieve, immunizing [the insurance guaranty association] only when its agents or employees committed no wrong and had little need for protection.\u201d <em>Hudson, </em>858 A.2d at 54. The <em>Hudson </em>court also cited to dicta in <em>Bills, </em>where the Arizona court reached a similar conclusion, stating that \u2018\u201cto accept plaintiffs contention that statutory immunity is automatically unavailable [when bad faith is alleged] would completely dilute, if not altogether eliminate\u2019 the immunity provision.\u201d <em>Hudson, </em>858 A.2d at 54 (quoting <em>Bills, </em>984 P.2d at 579). The <em>Hudson </em>court rejected <em>Ramsey, </em>explaining that its holding provided immunity to the insurance guaranty association only when its exposure to liability is virtually nonexistent.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-6\">\u00b627 The <em>Hudson </em>court determined the scope of immunity provided under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>the New Jersey insurance guaranty association act by examining the plain language of the immunity provision. The court focused on the statute\u2019s phrase that the insurance guaranty association is immune from liability for an \u201caction... taken... in the performance of... powers and duties under this act.\u201d <em>Hudson, </em>858 A.2d at 55. The court determined that the insurance guaranty association\u2019s \u201cpowers and duties\u201d under the act encompassed only those actions incidental to claims adjustment, processing, and payment on covered claims. <em>Hudson, </em>858 A.2d at 55. The court concluded, therefore, that the immunity provision protected the guaranty insurance association from liability arising out of its powers and duty to adjust, process, and pay covered claims, such as claims of bad faith.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-4\">\u00b628 The key distinction between <em>Hudson </em>and <em>Ramsey </em>rests on how the courts defined the insurance association\u2019s \u201cpowers and duties\u201d under the immunity provision. The <em>Hudson </em>court looked to the state\u2019s insurance guaranty association act \u201cas a whole\u201d to determine the extent of the association\u2019s immunity from liability arising out of claims of bad faith. <em>Hudson, </em>858 A.2d at 52. The <em>Ramsey </em>court by contrast relied on parts of the state\u2019s insurance guaranty association act read in conjunction with Washington\u2019s common law duties of good faith placed on ordinary insurers to determine the extent of WIGA\u2019s duties to pay covered claims. <em>Ramsey, </em>922 P.2d at 243.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-5\">\u00b629 The Boettchers ask us to undertake the reasoning in <em>Ramsey </em>because their claims rest on the statutoiy duties contained in the Act and the Unfair Trade Practices Act. The plain language of \u00a7 33-10-110, MCA, however, prevents us from doing so. The statute precludes liability on the part of MIGA, \u201cfor any action taken by [it] in the performance of [its] powers and duties <em>under this part.\u201d </em>Section 33-10-110, MCA (emphasis added). The plain meaning of the words \u201cunder this part\u201d directs us to look within the Act to determine what constitutes actions taken in the performance of MIGA\u2019s powers and duties for the purposes of determining the scope of immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-6\">\u00b630 Section 33-10-105, MCA, expressly provides MIGA\u2019s \u201cgeneral powers and duties,\u201d including MIGA\u2019s primary duty to pay \u201ccovered claims\u201d arising out of an insurance policy issued by an insolvent insurer that remained unpaid prior to the insolvency. <em>See </em>\u00a7 33-10-105(l)(a)(i), MCA. To this end, MIGA \u201cis considered the insurer to the extent of its obligation on the covered claims and to that extent has all rights, duties, and obligations of the insolvent insurer as if the insurer had not become insolvent.\u201d Section 33-10-105(l)(b), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-7\">\u00b631 The Boettchers argue that the language in \u00a7 33-10-105(l)(b), MCA, that MIGA carries \u201call the rights, duties, and obligations of the insolvent insurer <em>...\u201d </em>implicitly requires the Court to consider the duties of good <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>faith imposed on an insurer under the Unfair Trade Practices Act. The Boettchers overlook the fact that MIGA stands in the shoes of the insolvent insurer only to the extent of \u201cits obligation on the covered claims.\u201d Section 33-10-105(l)(b), MCA. MIGA fulfilled its obligations under \u00a7 33-10-105(1)03), MCA, by paying the statutory cap of $300,000 on the covered claims in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-3\">\u00b632 The Boettchers could have maintained an action to force MIGA to perform its statutory obligation to pay on the covered claims up to the $300,000 statutory limit stated in \u00a7 33-10-105(l)(a)(ii), MCA. We have refused to interpret the immunity granted by \u00a7 33-10-110, MCA, so broadly as to prevent an action that seeks to force MIGA to provide the service it was statutorily created to do-pay covered claims under the insurance policy. <em>Howell, </em>263 Mont. at 287, 868 P.2d at 575. We determined in <em>Howell </em>that a claim of attorney fees did not constitute a covered claim for the purposes of maintaining suit against MIGA. <em>Howell, </em>263 Mont. at 288, 868 P.2d at 576. Likewise, an action for bad faith, whether sounding in tort or statutorily based, falls outside the definition of \u201ccovered claims\u201d in \u00a7 33-10-102(2)(a), MCA. Moreover, bad faith claims arise out of actions taken by MIGA in performance of its statutory duty within the Act to pay such covered claims. Section 33-10-110, MCA, specifically bars such claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-4\">\u00b633 This conclusion furthers the Act\u2019s stated purposes to \u201cprovide a mechanism for the payment of covered claims under certain insurance policies to avoid excessive delay in payment and to avoid financial loss to claimants or policyholders because of the insolvency of an insurer ....\u201d Section 33-10-101(2), MCA. Reading the Act as a whole reflects the Legislature\u2019s intent to carry out the purpose of the Act by providing limited recovery to insureds. For instance, \u00a7 33-10-105, MCA, limits MIGA\u2019s duties to paying only covered claims as defined in the Act. Section 33-10-105(2)(a)(ii), MCA, caps such payments to $300,000 per covered claim. Section 33-10-115, MCA, requires insureds to collect payment under other policies carried by solvent insurers before turning to MIGA.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">\u00b634  We must construe these provisions \u201cliberally\u201d so as to give effect to the purpose of the Act. <em>See </em>\u00a7 33-10-101(4), MCA. In light of the Act\u2019s purpose to provide limited recovery, we interpret \u00a7 33-10-110, MCA, as protecting MIGA from liability arising from bad faith actions, whether grounded in tort or statutorily based, as such liability arises out of MIGA\u2019s actions in the performance of its duties to pay covered claims. We affirm the District Court\u2019s Order granting summary judgment in MIGA\u2019s favor.</p>\n<p id=\"ASq\">\u00b635 <em>Whether \u00a7 33-10-110, MCA, extends immunity to Western Guaranty and Reed.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">\u00b636 The Boettchers argue that Western Guaranty and Reed remain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>unprotected by \u00a7 33-10-110, MCA (2001), for two reasons. The Boettchers first assert that nothing in the plain language of the statute extends immunity to MIGA\u2019s agents, such as Western Guaranty and its employee Reed. The 2001 statute provides immunity to 'the association or its insurance producers or employees.\u201d Section 33-10-110, MCA. Second, the Boettchers argue that the Legislature\u2019s 2005 amendment to \u00a7 33-10-110, MCA, to extend immunity explicitly to MIGA\u2019s agents confirms that the 2001 statute failed to protect Western Guaranty and Reed from liability at the time the Boettchers filed their claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-4\">\u00b637 The plain language of \u00a7 33-10-110, MCA (2001), provides protection from liability to a specific class of people or organizations involved with MIGA. Those protected under the statute include: \u201cany member insurer, the association or its insurance producers or employees, the board of directors, or the commissioner or his representatives ...\u201d Section 33-10-110, MCA. Montana\u2019s original version of the immunity provision, enacted in 1971, expressly granted immunity to MIGA\u2019s \u201cagents.\u201d The original statute parallels immunity provisions protecting insurance guaranty associations and their \u201cagents\u201d in Nevada, Washington, Arizona, California, and Florida. <em>See Nevada Ins. Guaranty v. Sierra Auto Center, </em>844 P.2d 126 (Nev. 1992); <em>Ramsey, </em>922 P.2d 237; <em>Wells Fargo Cr. v. Arizona Prop. &amp; Cas., </em>799 P.2d 908 (Ariz. App. 1990); <em>Jones v. Florida Ins. Guar. Ass\u2019n, Inc., </em>908 So.2d 435 (Fla. 2005). Our Legislature deleted the word \u201cagent,\u201d however, from the entire insurance code in 1989, and inserted instead the term \u201cinsurance producers.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b426-5\">\u00b638 Western Guaranty and Reed argue that they remain protected under the 2001 statute regardless of Legislature\u2019s change of terms in 1989. Western Guaranty and Reed assert that the Legislature contemplated that MIGA would delegate its powers and duties to another organization under its authority in \u00a7 33-10-106, MCA. Western Guaranty and Reed contend that the legislative history behind \u00a7 33-10-110, MCA, shows the Legislature\u2019s intent to cloak those entities and their employees with the same immunity granted to MIGA.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-6\">\u00b639 The legislative history behind the 1989 amendments indicates that the Legislature changed the terminology to correspond with industry language and to streamline Montana\u2019s insurance licensing requirements with the licensing requirements of other states. The shift from \u201cagent\u201d to \u201cinsurance producer\u201d effectively required an agent to have an insurance license, and thus any revocation of a license in Montana could be recognized by other states. Likewise, the change allowed Montana to enforce license revocations imposed by other states operating under the multi-state licensing model. Nothing in the legislative history discusses the effect of the change in language to the Act, although such changes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>affected the entirety of the Act. House Comm, on Business and Economic Development, <em>Hearing on H.B. 734, </em>(Feb. 17, 1989); Sen. Comm. On Business and Industry, <em>Hearing on H.B. 734, </em>(Mar. 10, 1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b427-3\">\u00b640 Western Guaranty and Reed assert that the Legislature\u2019s 1989 amendment constituted a housekeeping measure that sought to align Montana\u2019s code with insurance provisions in other states. They argue that the Legislature, although changing the terms from \u201cagents\u201d to \u201cinsurance producers,\u201d never intended to abandon its original objective to provide immunity to MIGA\u2019s agents. Western Guaranty and Reed assert that the 2005 amendment reintroducing the term \u201cagent\u201d into \u00a7 33-10-110, MCA, simply clarified a pre-existing right of immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-4\">\u00b641 Our review of the legislative history behind the 2005 amendment shows, however, that the change in language \u201cextends\u201d immunity to MIGA\u2019s agents. House Comm, on Business and Labor, <em>Hearing on H.B. 168, </em>(Jan. 12, 2005); Sen. Comm. On Business, Labor, and Economic Affairs, <em>Hearing on H.B. 168, </em>(Mar. 4, 2005). The 2005 amendment and the accompanying legislative history convince us that the previous version of the statute failed to protect MIGA\u2019s agents from liability. No amendment would have been necessary otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">\u00b642 We must construe the 2001 statute as written. <em>Mont. for Justice, </em>\u00b6 60. An \u201cinsurance producer,\u201d means \u201ca person who solicits, negotiates, effects, procures, delivers, renews, continues, or binds\u201d policies of insurance for risks residing, located, or to be performed in this state. Section 33-17-102(9)(a)(i), MCA. Section 1-2-101, MCA, forbids this Court from inserting the term \u201cagent\u201d into the statute where the Legislature intentionally deleted it and replaced it with the term \u201cinsurance producer.\u201d Western Guaranty and Reed, as agents of MIGA, do not perform any of the specified functions of an \u201cinsurance producer\u201d as defined by the 2001 statute. Western Guaranty and Reed do not solicit, negotiate, effect, or procure policies of insurance. Western Guaranty and Reed likewise do not deliver, renew, continue, or bind policies of insurance. Western Guaranty and Reed handle claims for MIGA on policies originally sold by insolvent insurers.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-6\">\u00b643  Western Guaranty and Reed also do not qualify as employees of MIGA or any other parties so as to warrant their protection under the 2001 version of \u00a7 33-10-110, MCA. Title 33 of the Montana Code does not specifically define \u201cemployee.\u201d In the absence of a specific definition, we have employed the \u201ccommon sense interpretation\u201d as meaning \u201cthose engaged in the services for wages and salary by another.\u201d <em>Farmers Union Mut. Ins. Co. v. Horton, </em>2003 MT 79, \u00b6 18, 315 Mont. 43, \u00b6 18, 67 P.3d 285, \u00b6 18. Western Guaranty is a voluntary, nonprofit organization created by MIGA and five insurance guaranty associations from other states for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>purposes of carrying out the statutory duties under the states\u2019 respective insurance guaranty association acts. Western Guaranty performs services for MIGA in exchange for its operating costs, not for \u201cwages and salaries\u201d as required by the common definition of the word \u201cemployee.\u201d Thus, Western Guaranty does not qualify as an employee of MIGA as contemplated by the immunity provision of the 2001 Act. Similarly, Reed presumably serves as an employee of Western Guaranty. The 2001 Act extends no immunity to Western Guaranty and thus cannot extend immunity to Reed as an employee of Western Guaranty. We conclude, therefore, that the District Court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of Western Guaranty and Reed. We reverse and remand to the District Court for further proceedings on the issue of common law and statutory claims of bad faith involving Western Guaranty and Reed\u2019s handling of the Boettchers\u2019 claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-4\">\u00b644 <em>Whether \u00a7 33-10-110, MCA, violates substant\u00edve due process.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b428-5\">\u00b645 The Boettchers challenge the constitutionality of \u00a7 33-10-110, MCA, on grounds that the law violates substantive due process. We already have determined that M. R. App. P. 38 precludes this Court from considering the Boettchers\u2019 constitutional arguments. <em>See Boettcher v. Montana Guar. Fund (Boettchers I), </em>2006 MT 127, \u00b6\u00b6 12-29, 332 Mont. 279, \u00b6\u00b6 12-29, 140 P.3d 474, \u00b6\u00b6 12-29.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-6\">\u00b646 M. R. App. P. 38 requires a party to give written notice to this Court and the Montana attorney general of a constitutional challenge in an action where the state is not a party. Such notice \u201cshall be given contemporaneously with the filing of the notice of appeal or with the filing of an original proceeding in the supreme court.\u201d M. R. App. P. 38. The Boettchers\u2019 failure to file contemporaneous notice of their constitutional question as required by M. R. App. P. 38 precludes our consideration of the Boettchers\u2019 constitutional arguments on appeal. <em>Boettchers I, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 12-29.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-7\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b428-8\">\u00b647 We affirm the District Court\u2019s Order granting summary judgment in favor of MIGA on the grounds that \u00a7 33-10-110, MCA, protected it from liability arising from statutory and common law claims of bad faith. We reverse the District Court\u2019s Order granting summary judgment in favor of Western Guaranty and Reed and remand for further proceedings on the issue of Western Guaranty and Reed\u2019s liability related to the Boettchers\u2019 statutory and common claims of bad faith.</p>\n<judges id=\"b428-9\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES COTTER, RICE and WARNER concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
