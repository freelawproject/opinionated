The declaration was on account annexed.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">Plaintiff died before hearing, and the case was brought to trial and is prosecuted by her executrix.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-6\">At the trial, April Term, 1931, \u201cthree separate sheets of paper\u201d were offered in evidence as the original entries of the items contained in the account annexed to the writ.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-7\">What the sheets would show was supplemented by testimony that the words and figures on the several sheets were written by the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-8\">But it appeared in testimony that more than was contained in the memoranda may have been incorporated in the count in the writ. .</p>\n<p id=\"b484-9\">The witness was of counsel in the case, and argued before this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-10\">He testified that the plaintiff took the three sheets from her pocketbook, in his office, and handed them to him during an interview previous to the bringing of the suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-11\">When asked whether from that memoranda he prepared the account sued on, he replied: \u201cI did from that memoranda and I won\u2019t say positively whether all the account which I prepared is on that memoranda, but while she was there I prepared the account from the memoranda, and possibly from her memory, I wouldn\u2019t say.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b484-12\">On objection the sheets of paper were excluded, and exceptions taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-13\">The Justice, at trial, had before him the memoranda sheets. He had in mind the previous rulings of this Court on the question of their admissibility as expressed in <em>Mansfield </em>v. <em>Gushee, </em>120 Me., 333 and the authorities there cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-14\">If we are to review his finding it is a prime essential that the sheets offered in evidence be made a part of the bill of exceptions. This has not been done. They are not before us. Without the papers that were excluded we can not overrule the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-15\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
