One testifies that the name of the scaler at the mill was given when the contract was made. This the plaintiff denies ; and he insists that, with full knowledge he must pay to the owners of the land where the logs were to be cut for all merchantable logs he should cut, it was agreed on the part of defendant, by one of the agents, at the office of the latter, in New Limerick, that the land owners\u2019 scale, the stumpage scale, would be considered in settlement.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-9\">Plaintiff testified to the following conversation on this point, \u201cSpeaking about the scale, I think just before I went the last time he said, \u2018What about the scale?\u2019 I said that I didn\u2019t care who scaled it as long as I got ten hundred feet for a thousand; that I couldn\u2019t buy 500,000 and sell it for 400,000. And he said \u2018I know it, and I\u2019ll stand between jmu and the stumpage scale.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b26-10\">In the course of the trial, examination was had as to the stump-age scale.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-11\">Under plaintiff\u2019s license to cut the logs in question, as shown by the license, or permit, admitted as an exhibit, scale which was to be final between land owners and operator was to be made by a person to be appointed by the land owners. Plaintiff called and examined a man who testified that he scaled the first 159 logs of the 4,000 and more that were delivered to defendant, and this witness testified that he saw no more of plaintiff\u2019s operation, after <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>scaling these few logs. He testified that the land owners sent another scaler, a Mr. Griffin, to complete the scale.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-5\">Plaintiff\u2019s counsel offered as Exhibit B a scale bill signed by the witness, tallying 616,008 feet, board measure, as the scale of plaintiff\u2019s entire operation.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-6\">But the witness testified that at the time of signing this scale bill he knew nothing as to its accuracy; that the figures were given him by a man interested in the business of one of the land owners, and not by any of the scalers who might be considered as under the supervision of the witness as the \u201chead scaler.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b27-7\">At the insistence of this other man, witness testified, \u201cI checked his (the third party\u2019s) figures and signed my name to it, which I should not have done.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b27-8\">Said he, \u201cI will say that I didn\u2019t know anything about that lumber.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b27-9\">The witness admitted that he set Mr. Griffin to work as scaler for the land owners and told him what to do. But before a so-called head scaler may accept as accurate the findings of an assistant, he must have more knowledge of such assistant\u2019s work than would be conveyed by \u00e1 report submitted by another who is a stranger to the operation. He must be satisfied of the accuracy of the report presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-10\">Generally speaking his assistants must be of his choice; certainly they must be workmen approved by him.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-11\">Generally the head scaler must have seen the .assistant at work, in the same or a like operation, in order to satisfy himself that the method of scaling is his own, or what he can approve. Then, \u201cThe data obtained by his assistants in their measurements and scale of the logs, and the entries and memoranda thereof made by them, acting under his direction, and inspected, corrected and adopted by him, may be used by the scaler in the determination of the quantity of logs scaled.\u201d <em>Bank </em>v. <em>H. </em>&amp; <em>W. Co., </em>106 Me., 326.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-12\">But the paper admitted as Exhibit B was not identified as an accurate scale bill.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-13\">Its author was not called for that purpose, even though it was testified by the ostensible author that the man who could swear to the assembling of its total could be produced in court that day.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>Exhibit B was but hearsay, and as such, admission of it for the consideration of the jury was reversible error, as stated recently by this court in <em>Edwards </em>v. <em>Goodall, </em>126 Me., 254.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-5\">Not only was the exhibit inadmissible; it seems to be assumed its consideration was prejudicial, for counsel for plaintiff in his brief argues, \u201cThe jury evidently took the stumpage scale and deducted 10% . . . and also made other deductions and found for the plaintiff, as the verdict shows.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b28-6\">Some argument for the admission of this exhibit and another is adduced because the Court, in ruling on defendant\u2019s objection, said, \u201cThey are admitted for what they are worth.\u201d This expression is unfortunate.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-7\">The question raised by the objection was whether or no, under the rules of evidence prevailing in this jurisdiction, the paper presented was to be read by the jury or to them.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-8\">Defendant urges that it was aggrieved by the ruling of the Court, and defendant\u2019s contention is sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"AqS\">\n<em>Exceptions sustained.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
