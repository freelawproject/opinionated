He testified that defendant claimed to own the land over which plaintiff asserts defendant had only right of passage.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-6\">The particular act of trespass complained of in the writ is that on July 7, 1930, defendant deposited on the passageway six cords of cordwood and sawed and split it thereon.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-7\">In defense, the general issue was filed,, and with it, in brief statement, \u201cThat the defendant has for over twenty years, to wit for thirty-nine years, openly, continuously, notoriously, visibly, uninterruptedly, adversely, under a claim of right, and with the acquiescence of the plaintiff or his predecessors in title exercised the right of piling wood, iron and other materials on plaintiff\u2019s land as described in plaintiff\u2019s writ, and has exercised the right to remove the same from time to time, to saw the wood and do other things in connection with the wood and iron so piled there, and defendant claims a right by prescription to do the acts complained of in plaintiff\u2019s writ.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b162-8\">At the conclusion of plaintiff\u2019s evidence defendant moved for a non-suit, and it was granted; plaintiff claiming and filing exceptions thereto.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-9\">This was error, for one of the essential elements of securing title by prescription is acquiescence on the part of the owner of the servient estate. <em>Rollins </em>v. Blackden, 112 Me., 459; <em>Dartnell </em>v. Bidwell, 115 Me., 227.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-10\">That absence of acquiescence on the part of the latter may be evidenced by verbal protest alone, see cases cited above and note, 5 A. L. R., 1325,19 C. J. 883, note 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-11\">Having set up the defense of title by prescription the burden of proving its several essential elements was on the defendant, and the trial should not have been interrupted as it was.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-12\">\n<em>Exception sustained.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
