A decree was duly filed in accordance with such finding and an appeal taken therefrom.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-7\">The petitioner was employed as a riveter. It was his duty to insert rivets in an article manufactured by his employer, and hold this in a machine while the rivets were headed. It is conceded that there was some pounding by the machine, and that the petitioner had a tingling or stinging sensation in his finger tips from this. Gangrene developed in certain of his fingers and one of them had to be amputated. A reading of the evidence indicates that this gangrenous condition was caused by an obstruction in one of the arteries in his arm.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-8\">The commissioner found that the petitioner did not suffer a compensable accident directly responsible for the incapacity suffered, nor an accident, as a result of his employment, resulting in incapacity because of aggravation of a preexisting physical condition. This finding is amply supported by the evidence. Appeal dismissed. Decree affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
