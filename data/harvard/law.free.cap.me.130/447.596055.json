By whom it was written, there was no suggestion.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-11\">On the evidence of that statement, and of a similar one by the plaintiff Frances Poland, which latter statement was also introduced in defense, the case for the defendant was rested.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-12\">Counsel for the plaintiffs now recalled Helen Collins to the witness stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-13\">The transcript of the evidence and proceedings, so far as pertinent, is as follows :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-14\">\u201cBy Mr. Hutchins.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-15\">\u201cQ. After the statement was made and signed, did you then learn who this man represented?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-16\">\u201cA. I did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-17\">\u201cQ. And whom did he represent ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-18\">\u201cMr. Beliveau: I object, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-19\">\u201cThe Court: On what ground?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-20\">\u201cMr. Beliveau: I don\u2019t think it is material.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-21\">\u201c(Conference at bench)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-22\">\u201cThe Court: Plaintiff\u2019s attorney stated the purpose of his question was to disclose that the man in question was a representative of the insurance company which carried insurance on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>the car in question. The attorney for the defense objected to the question on the ground that its purpose wasn\u2019t a proper one, and inadmissible. Admitted; exception allowed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-5\">\u201c(Question read)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-6\">\u201cA. The insurance company.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b459-7\">The objected evidence was but hearsay.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-8\">Since the evidence was not incident to proper proof, and was without probative value as respected any legitimate issue, its injection, without necessity or occasion, appears to have been deliberate and wilful, to inform the jury that an insurance company was interested. The reference to the insurer may have accomplished further purpose, and created a prejudice against the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-9\">The introduction of the evidence constituted reversible error. <em>Ritchie </em>v. <em>Perry, </em>129 Me., 440; <em>Skillin </em>v. <em>Skillin, </em>130 Me., 223.</p>\n<p id=\"A3H\">Exception must be sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-10\">Other exceptions saved on the trial, and exceptions to refusal, at the close of the evidence, to direct verdicts for the defendant, need not be considered, nor need the motions for new trials.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-11\">The reason is that the sustaining of the first exception sends the cases back to be tried again.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-12\">\n<em>First exception, that to the introduction of prejudicial hearsay, sustained.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
