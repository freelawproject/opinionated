Such contract may be express or implied. <em>Saunders </em>v. <em>Saunders, </em>90 Me., 284.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-11\">To demonstrate the existence of an implied contract facts and circumstances must be presented from which a hiring can be implied : it must appear that the plaintiff rendered services in behalf of the defendant, with the knowledge and consent of the latter. , \u00a1 In case there were no evidence of the setting up of a contract; no ratification of a suggested contract, nor evidence sufficient to, justify reasonable men in concluding that plaintiff performed, services beneficial to defendant in effecting a sale, under an implied contract, the order of nonsuit was proper. ,</p>\n<p id=\"b395-12\">But there was evidence of employment,- The testimony is that while the defendant, for eight .years prior to the sale of his store, had been a retail merchant in Brunswick, plaintiff had for more than twenty years been a real estate broker in. that village, had known defendant and had traded with him more or less for eight years. He maintained an office in furtherance of his real estate business and for years had advertised such business in the local newspaper.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>He testified that, knowing that one Senter was ready to buy real estate on Main Street, he approached defendant to ascertain whether the latter would sell his property there situate. The record reads: \u201cI went to Mr. Farr and asked him if he wanted to sell this property. He said he did. I asked him for how much. He said, \u2018Fifteen thousand dollars.\u2019 I said, \u2018That is rather high, Mr. Farr, but I will see what I can do.\u2019 He said, \u2018All right.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">After an interview with the prospective buyer, plaintiff had a second conference with defendant. It is reported as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b396-6\">\u201cQ. And'will you tell us what conversation you had withMr. Farr at that time?</p>\n<p id=\"b396-7\">\u201cA. Yes, sir. I said, \u2018Mr. Farr, I cannot get $15,000. Can\u2019t you make me a better price? He thought \u00e1 moment and then said $13,000.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b396-8\">\u201cQ. What did you say?</p>\n<p id=\"b396-9\">\u201cA. I said, \u2018All right, I will see what I can do.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b396-10\">\u201cQ. And did he say anything?</p>\n<p id=\"b396-11\">\u201cA. \u2018All right.\u2019\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b396-12\"><em>; </em>It appears that defendant sold in October, the consideration being $12,500 and the right on the part of the defendant to remain upon the premises and occupy certain rooms in the building until the succeeding April, or later.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-13\">Plaintiff further testified that upon learning defendant had sold the property to his prospective buyer, he went to defendant and the following conversation was had,' \u201cMr. Farr, I see you have sold your place to Mr. Senter. He said, \u2018Yes.\u2019 I said, \u2018There is a commission due me.\u2019 He says, \u2018I guess not; I didn\u2019t get $13,000 for it.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b396-14\">Such testimony as that quoted above, especially because it is corroborated or strengthened by other testimony and by circumstances of probative value, definitely raised the question of fact, was there a contract by which plaintiff became defendant\u2019s broker to sell the property?</p>\n<p id=\"b396-15\">It follows that an answer should have been sought from the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-16\">\n<em>Exception to nonsuit sustained.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
