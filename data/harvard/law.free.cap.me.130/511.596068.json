The jury returned a verdict for the defendant and the case is before this court on the plaintiff\u2019s general motion for a new trial.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AP8\"><em>Percy Higgins, </em>for plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"AiE\"><em>Stanley F. Needham, George E. Thompson, </em>for defendant.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">The parties were the owners of adjoining lots of land in Old Town. The defendant acquired title to her lot May 2, 1902, the plaintiff to his lot in 1891. The plaintiff claims a right of way over the defendant\u2019s land by prescription. As the plaintiff was one of the grantors in the deed to the defendant in which there was no reservation of any right in the defendant\u2019s land, a title by prescription must be based on an adverse use for twenty years since 1902.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-6\">The defendant admits that the plaintiff did pass and repass across her land, but contends that such use was promiscuous and general and was not confined to any definite way, that the use was not adverse but permissive, and that, if there was any adverse use, it was interrupted by the defendant during the twenty, year period. To sustain these claims evidence was introduced. The testimony for the plaintiff and for the defendant was conflicting. The jury saw and heard the witnesses and in the absence of exceptions we must assume were properly instructed on the law. The determination of the issues of fact was peculiarly the province of the jury, and we see no reason for disturbing their verdict. Motion overruled.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
