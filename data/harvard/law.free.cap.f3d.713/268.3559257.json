The district court denied the school district\u2019s subsequent request for attorneys\u2019 fees. Although the parents asserted that the district court\u2019s denial of attorneys\u2019 fees in turn rendered them prevailing parties\u2014 potentially entitling them to attorneys\u2019 fees \u2014 -the district court declined to award attorneys\u2019 fees to the parents. Because defeating a request for attorneys\u2019 fees is not the type of success on the merits required to establish prevailing party status, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-14\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-15\">C.C. is a disabled minor child enrolled in school in Texas\u2019s Alief Independent School District (\u201cAISD\u201d). On May 29, 2007, C.C.\u2019s parents (\u201cthe Parents\u201d) filed an administrative complaint against AISD with the Texas Education Agency, alleging multiple violations of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (\u201cIDEA\u201d). <em>See 20 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1415(i)(3)(B). In response, AISD filed a request for a hearing and declaratory judgment. Declining to proceed further, the parents voluntarily dismissed their complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-16\">However, AISD proceeded with the hearing and presented unopposed evidence demonstrating its compliance with the IDEA. After the administrative Hearing Officer ruled in favor of AISD, AISD filed suit in the district court under 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415(i)(2)(A), seeking an award of attorneys\u2019 fees. Specifically, AISD alleged that it was entitled to attorneys\u2019 fees because the Parents had filed their IDEA com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>plaint for an \u201cimproper purpose.\u201d <em>See id. </em>The district court rejected AISD\u2019s argument, refused to impose attorneys\u2019 fees, and entered judgment accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-4\">The Parents then petitioned the district court for their own attorneys\u2019 fees, arguing that by successfully defeating AISD\u2019s claim for attorneys\u2019 fees, they had become a \u201cprevailing party\u201d entitled to attorneys\u2019 fees under the IDEA. The district court summarily denied the petition, and the Parents now appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-6\">We review a district court\u2019s grant or denial of attorneys\u2019 fees under the IDEA for abuse of discretion. <em>T.B. ex rel. Debbra B. v. Bryan Indep. Sch. Dist., </em>628 F.3d 240, 243 (5th Cir.2010). However, we review underlying conclusions of law and interpretations of the statute de novo. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b318-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-8\">The only question before us is whether a parent who loses a suit under the IDEA becomes a \u201cprevailing party\u201d by defeating a subsequent petition for attorneys\u2019 fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-9\">The relevant IDEA statutory provision provides, \u201cIn any action or proceeding brought under this section, the court, in its discretion, may award reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees as part of the costs \u2014 (I) to a prevailing party who is the parent of a child with a disability.\u201d 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415(i)(3)(B). Thus, only a parent who can rightly be classified as a \u201cprevailing party\u201d is entitled to attorneys\u2019 fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-10\">The \u201ctouchstone of the prevailing party inquiry must be the material alteration of the legal relationship of the parties in a manner which Congress sought to promote in the fee statute.\u201d <em>El Paso In-dep. Sch. Dist. v. Richard R., </em>591 F.3d 417, 422 (5th Cir.2009). \u201cUnder the IDEA, a prevailing party is one that attains a remedy that both (1) alters the legal relationship between the school district and the handicapped child and (2) fosters the purposes of the IDEA.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 421-22. While a party does not need to prevail on every issue to become a prevailing party, she must prevail on some \u201csignificant issue in litigation which achieves some of the benefit the parties sought in bringing suit.\u201d <em>See Hensley v. Eckerhart, </em>461 U.S. 424, 433, 103 S.Ct. 1933, 76 L.Ed.2d 40 (1983). Moreover, the relief obtained must be \u201ca judgment on the merits, a consent decree, or some similar form of judicially sanctioned relief.\u201d <em>Richard R., </em>591 F.3d at 422.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-15\">The Parents argue that they are prevailing parties under this standard, because they have achieved a remedy that \u201caltered the legal relationship\u201d between the parties. Because the district court has permanently foreclosed AISD\u2019s ability to seek attorneys\u2019 fees, the Parents argue, their legal relationship to AISD has been officially altered. While the Parents have prevailed in a very narrow and hollow sense, this is precisely the type of \u201cde minimis\u201d or \u201ctechnical victory\u201d that the Supreme Court has found so insignificant as to not create prevailing party status. <em>See Texas State Teachers Ass\u2019n v. Garland Indep. Sch. Dist., </em>489 U.S. 782, 792, 109 S.Ct. 1486, 103 L.Ed.2d 866 (1989). As the Supreme Court has repeatedly emphasized, \u201cOur \u2018[r]espect for ordinary language requires that a plaintiff receive at least some relief on the merits of his claim before he can be said to prevail.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Successfully refuting a claim for attorneys\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>fees is not a benefit that the Parents sought in bringing suit, nor can it rightfully be described as \u201crelief on the merits\u201d or a true \u201cremedy\u201d of any nature.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Parents filed an unsuccessful complaint and were merely fortunate enough to have the lower court deny a common request for attorneys\u2019 fees. In no way have they succeeded on the merits of their claim or achieved a desired remedy.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-4\">Our review of caselaw confirms this interpretation. The type of victories, short of total success, to which the Supreme Court has been willing to ascribe prevailing party status are in the nature of settlement agreements enforced through a consent decree, partial success on the merits, injunctive relief, declaratory relief, and nominal damages.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The only case we have located that considers a similar factual situation is <em>R.P. ex rel. C.P. v. Prescott Unified School District, </em>631 F.3d 1117, 1127-28 (9th Cir.2011). In <em>Prescott USD, </em>the Ninth Circuit reviewed the district court\u2019s rejection of an IDEA claim brought by parents of a disabled child against an Arizona school district. Though the <em>Prescott USD </em>court affirmed the district court\u2019s dismissal of the IDEA claim, it reversed the district court\u2019s award of attorneys\u2019 fees to the school district. <em>Id. </em>at 1124-27. However, the court also denied the parents\u2019 subsequent request for attorneys\u2019 fees, stating: \u201cBecause the parents aren\u2019t entitled to relief on the merits of their IDEA claim, they aren\u2019t entitled to fees on appeal. <em>See </em>20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415(i)(3)(B)(i)(I) (permitting an award of fees to a \u201cprevailing party\u201d).\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1127-28. We agree with the Ninth Circuit that successfully defending an ancillary request for attorneys\u2019 fees, without more, does not qualify as the relief on the merits necessary to create a prevailing party.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-9\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-10\">For the reasons stated above, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b318-11\">. <em>Buckhannon Bd. &amp; Care Home, Inc. v.
