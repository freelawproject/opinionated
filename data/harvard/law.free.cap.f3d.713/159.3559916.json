(\u201cPlaintiffs\u201d) appeal from an April 19, 2011 Opinion and Order by the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (Swain, <em>J.) </em>granting Defendant-Appellee the United States\u2019 motion to dismiss Plaintiffs\u2019 complaints against the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the \u201cSEC\u201d) for lack of subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1). Plaintiffs also appeal from the district court\u2019s January 24, 2011 Memorandum Order denying Plaintiffs\u2019 motion for relief from judgment under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b). Plaintiffs seek to hold the United States liable for SEC employees\u2019 failure to detect Bernard Madoff s Ponzi scheme and for the financial losses that Plaintiffs claim they suffered as a result. Because we find that the SEC\u2019s actions, along with its regrettable inaction, are shielded by the Discretionary Function Exception, we affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of Plaintiffs\u2019 claims for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-12\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b209-13\">Plaintiffs are investors who lost money they had entrusted to Bernard Madoff (\u201cMadoff\u2019) and his firm, Bernard L. Ma-doff Investment Securities LLC, after Ma-doffs massive Ponzi scheme exploded in 2008. Plaintiffs\u2019 principal allegation is that the SEC negligently failed to uncover Ma-doffs fraud despite receiving numerous complaints over a sixteen-year period. Relying on an extensive report from the SEC\u2019s Office of the Inspector General, Plaintiffs allege in detail approximately eight separate complaints the SEC received regarding Madoff and the SEC\u2019s inadequate and often incompetent response to each. As a result of the SEC\u2019s repeated failure to alert other branch offices of ongoing investigations, properly review complaints and staff subsequent inquiries, and follow up on disputed facts elicited in interviews, the SEC missed many opportunities to uncover Madoffs multi-billion-dollar fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-14\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b209-15\">Plaintiffs claim that the SEC\u2019s clear negligence exposes the agency to liability under the Federal Tort Claims Act (\u201cFTCA\u201d). The district court disagreed, as do we. The FTCA provides in relevant part that federal courts</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AmJ\">shall have exclusive jurisdiction of civil actions on claims against the United States, for money damages, accruing on and after January 1, 1945, for injury or loss of property, or personal injury or death caused by the negligent or wrongful act or omission of any employee of the Government while acting within the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>scope of his office or employment, under circumstances where the United States, if a private person, would be liable to the claimant in accordance with the law of the place where the act or omission occurred.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b210-4\">28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1346(b)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">The FTCA is an exception to the rule that the United States is typically immune from suit. The district court determined that the Discretionary Function Exception (\u201cDFE\u201d), an exception to the exception, barred Plaintiffs\u2019 claims. The DFE suspends the FTCA from applying to</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-6\">[a]ny claim based upon an act or omission of an employee of the Government, exercising due care, in the execution of a statute or regulation, whether or not such statute or regulation be valid, or based upon the exercise or performance or the failure to exercise or perform a discretionary function or duty on the part of a federal agency or an employee of the Government, whether or not the discretion involved be abused.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b210-7\">28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2680(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b210-8\">The DFE is not about fairness, it \u201cis about power,\u201d <em>National Union Fire Insurance v. United States, </em>115 F.3d 1415, 1422 (9th Cir.1997); the sovereign \u201creserve[s] to itself the right to act without liability for misjudgment and carelessness in the formulation of policy,\u201d <em>id. </em>\u201c[T]he DFE bars suit only if two conditions are met: (1) the acts alleged to be negligent must be discretionary, in that they involve an \u2018element of judgment or choice\u2019 and are not compelled by statute or regulation and (2) the judgment or choice in question must be grounded in \u2018considerations of public policy\u2019 or susceptible to policy analysis.\u201d <em>Coulthurst v. United States, </em>214 F.3d 106, 109 (2d Cir.2000) <em>(quoting United States v. Gaubert, </em>499 U.S. 315, 322-23, 111 S.Ct. 1267, 113 L.Ed.2d 335 (1991)). Plaintiffs bear the initial burden to state a claim that is not barred by the DFE. <em>See Gaubert, </em>499 U.S. at 324-25, 111 S.Ct. 1267. Here, Plaintiffs have failed to make the necessary showing.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-10\">Plaintiffs\u2019 harm ultimately stems from the SEC\u2019s failure to investigate Madoff and uncover his Ponzi scheme. As a result, the conduct Plaintiffs seek to challenge is \u201ctoo intertwined with purely discretionary decisions\u201d made by SEC personnel. <em>Gray v. Bell, </em>712 F.2d 490, 515 (D.C.Cir.1983); <em>see generally id. </em>at 515-16. Despite our sympathy for Plaintiffs\u2019 predicament (and our antipathy for the SEC\u2019s conduct), Congress\u2019s intent to shield regulatory agencies\u2019 discretionary use of specific investigative powers via the DFE is fatal to Plaintiffs\u2019 claims. <em>See Berkovitz by Berkovitz v. United States, </em>486 U.S. 531, 538 <em>&amp; </em>538 n. 4, 108 S.Ct. 1954, 100 L.Ed.2d 531 (1988) (quoting H.R.Rep. No. 1287, 79th Cong., 1st Sess., 6 (1945)). In satisfaction of the first prong of the DFE, the SEC retains complete discretion over when, whether and to what extent to investigate and bring an action against an individual or entity. <em>See </em>15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78u(a)(l); 17 C.F.R. \u00a7 202.5(a)-(b). The conduct in question here meets the second prong of the DFE by virtue of the SEC\u2019s choices regarding allocation of agency time and resources being sufficiently grounded in economic, social and policy considerations. <em>See Bd. of Trade of City of Chicago v. SEC, </em>883 F.2d 525, 531 (7th Cir.1989); <em>cf. Coulthurst, </em>214 F.3d at 108-11.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-11\">We find additionally that the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Plaintiffs\u2019 Rule 60(b) motion for relief from judgment, or in denying Plaintiffs\u2019 request for jurisdictional discovery. <em>Boule v. Hutton, </em>328 F.3d 84, 95 (2d Cir.2003) (we review denials of Rule 60(b) motions for abuse of discretion); <em>Best Van Lines, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number><em>Inc. v. Walker, </em>490 F.3d 239, 255 (2d Cir.2007) (we review district court\u2019s refusal to permit jurisdictional discovery for abuse of discretion). We have considered Plaintiffs\u2019 remaining arguments and find them to be without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-4\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">For the foregoing reasons, the order of the district court is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
