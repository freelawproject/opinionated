They merely define the conditions under which a court may dispose of a postconviction petition without conducting an evidentiary hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-17\">In <em>State </em>v. <em>Mapson </em>(1982), 1 Ohio St. 3d 217, we held that a trial court is required to prepare findings of fact and conclusions of law even upon a summary dismissal of a postconviction petition. Moreover, respondent has not demonstrated any particular facts which would justify departing from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>the rule set forth in <em>Mapson. </em>It has not even supplied a copy of relator\u2019s petition to demonstrate its alleged deficiencies. In addition, it submits the transcripts of relator\u2019s plea and sentencing hearings to support the motion to dismiss demonstrating that it relied on more than the deficiencies in relator\u2019s petition when it denied relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-4\">Accordingly, the writ of mandamus is allowed on authority of <em>State </em>v. <em>Mapson, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b73-5\">\n<em>Writ allowed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b73-6\">Celebrezze, C.J., Sweeney, Locher, Holmes, C.
