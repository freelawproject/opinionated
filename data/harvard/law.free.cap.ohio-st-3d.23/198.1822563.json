If such will was executed within six months of the testator\u2019s death, such devises and bequests shall be valid to the extent they do not in the aggregate exceed twenty-five per cent of the value of the testator\u2019s net probate estate, and in the event the aggregate of the devises and bequests exceeds twenty-five per cent thereof, such devises and bequests shall be abated proportionately so that the aggregate thereof equals twenty-five per cent of the value of the testator\u2019s net probate estate. * *</p>\n<p id=\"b226-14\">\u201c(C) The portion of any such devises and bequests which is invalid under this section shall be distributed per stirpes among such testator\u2019s issue * *</p>\n<p id=\"b226-15\">It is undisputed that four of the beneficiaries under Myrtle Davis\u2019 last will \u2014 the Salvation Army, Fairfield Church of God, Shriners\u2019 Hospital for Crippled Children, and Twin Wells Indian School \u2014 are organized for \u201cbenevolent, religious, educational, or charitable\u201d purposes within the meaning of former R.C. 2107.06; and, the record indicates that the assets of Davis\u2019 estate are sufficient, after payment of all debts and expenses of administration, to pay these beneficiaries more than twenty-five percent of the net probate estate. By operation of R.C. 2107.06, the bequests to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>these beneficiaries (especially the residual bequests to Shriners and Twin Wells Indian School) would be substantially reduced, and Davis\u2019 grandchildren, who were not named as beneficiaries in her will but who are her heirs-at-law pursuant to R.C. 2107.06(C), would receive a substantial portion of her estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">The appellees, Shriners, Hester and Twin Wells Indian School, contend that former R.C. 2107.06 should not be applied to Davis\u2019 last will, because application of the statute would alter Davis\u2019 will in a manner that is contrary to her wishes and would unreasonably deprive certain of her intended beneficiaries of the gifts to which they would otherwise be entitled. Shriners urges the court either to adopt the doctrine of dependent relative revocation (in order that Davis\u2019 revoked will of January 31, 1980 can be given effect), or to hold that former R.C. 2107.06 is violative of the Equal Protection and Free Exercise Clauses of the Ohio and United States Constitutions.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-7\">Focusing, first, on Shriners\u2019 challenge to the constitutionality of former R.C. 2107.06, we look to the purpose of the statute. Modern mortmain statutes<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> are directed toward the testator who executes his will under the belief that his death is near. Generally, the purpose of these statutes has been to prevent such a testator from disposing of his estate, as a result of unsound judgment or undue influence, in a manner that is prejudicial to his next of kin. Because it was felt that certain individuals and organizations were in a position to benefit from the execution of a will by a \u201cdeath-bed\u201d testator, bequests to these individuals and organizations have been singled out in mortmain statutes as being invalid, either in whole or in part. Under former R.C. 2107.06, bequests made for governmental, benevolent, religious, educational or charitable purposes were deemed invalid insofar as their value exceeded twenty-five percent of the value of the testator\u2019s net probative estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-8\">Traditional scrutiny of R.C. 2107.06 for purposes of equal protection analysis requires a determination as to whether the statute is rationally related to the accomplishment of a legitimate state objective. <em>McGowan </em>v. <em>Maryland </em>(1961), 366 U.S. 420 [17 O.O.2d 151]; <em>Bd. of Edn. </em>v. <em>Walter </em>(1979), 58 Ohio St. 2d 368 [12 O.O.3d 327]; <em>Kinney </em>v. <em>Kaiser Aluminum &amp; Chemical Corp. </em>(1975), 41 Ohio St. 2d 120 [70 O.O.2d 206]. We believe that the protection of a testator\u2019s issue from disinheritance, as a result of the testator\u2019s unsound judgment or the undue influence of third parties upon the testator, is a legitimate state objective. Our analysis narrows, therefore, to the question of whether R.C. 2107.06 is rationally related to the accomplishment of that objective.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-9\">It is apparent that R.C. 2107.06 will accomplish its objective in some <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>cases \u2014 <em>i.e., </em>those in which the testator, having acted under the belief that his death was near, executed a will within the six months prior to his death, making bequests therein for governmental, benevolent, religious, educational or charitable purposes on the basis of unsound judgment or as the result of undue influence. Unfortunately, a large number of cases falling within the scope of R.C. 2107.06 involve the estates of testators who did <em>not </em>execute their last will under the belief that their death was near. Furthermore, out of the remaining cases impacted by the statute in which the testator did believe that he was near death, it is reasonable to assume that few involved bequests that were based upon unsound judgment or the result of undue influence by a governmental, benevolent, religious, educational or charitable beneficiary.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">Thus, by operation of R.C. 2107.06, a select class of beneficiaries is deprived of testamentary bequests, even though in the vast majority of cases such bequests are entirely legitimate and not within the scope of the statute\u2019s objective. Additionally, R.C. 2107.06 effectively creates an irrebuttable presumption that a testator, who made substantial \u201ccharitable\u201d bequests in a will that was executed within six months prior to his death, acted with unsound judgment or under undue influence. Such \u201c \u2018irrebuttable presumptions have long been disfavored under the Due Process Clauses of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments,\u2019 expecially when they are \u2018not necessarily or universally true in fact, and when the state has reasonable alternative means of making the crucial determination.\u2019 \u201d <em>Hall </em>v. <em>Rosen </em>(1977), 50 Ohio St. 2d 135, at 142 [4 O.O.3d 336] (Justice William B. Brown, dissenting, quoting <em>Vlandis </em>v. <em>Kline </em>[1973], 412 U.S. 411, 446 and 452). Although Shriners has not directly challenged the validity of R.C. 2107.06 on due process grounds, the creation of the aforementioned irrebuttable presumption, in spite of the existence of \u201creasonable alternative means\u201d for determining whether the testator acted with unsound judgment or under undue influence,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> evinces a lack of rationality in the operation of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">Additional evidence of the unreasonable character of R.C. 2107.06 is found in the requirement that charitable bequests in excess of twenty-five percent of the value of the testator\u2019s net probate estate be \u201cdistributed per stirpes among such testator\u2019s issue.\u201d In the instant case, the trial court found that Davis\u2019 issue \u2014 her grandchildren \u2014 were, \u201cfrom a practical standpoint, * * * strangers to the testatrix.\u201d The statute thus operates to invalidate legitimate gifts to worthy organizations solely for the benefit of persons who were neither dependent upon nor closely involved with the life of the testatrix. When Ohio\u2019s first mortmain statute was enacted in the nineteenth century, families were usually supported by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>a single head of household, life insurance was not commonplace, and social welfare programs were, for the most part, non-existent. The original mortmain statute thus expressed, in part, a legitimate concern for the financial well-being of a testator\u2019s dependents. Societal changes that have reduced the bases for this concern have also reduced the need to provide a testator\u2019s issue with an inheritance through mortmain.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">The imprecise nature of R.C. 2107.06 is further borne out by its failure to address <em>inter-vivos </em>death-bed transfers that are made to the prejudice of the grantor\u2019s issue and bequests made by terminally ill testators <em>more </em>than six months before their death. Additionally, the statute\u2019s invalidation of bequests for governmental, benevolent, religious, educational and charitable purposes appears grossly unfair in view of its failure to address bequests, which are not designated for any of the foregoing purposes, to persons such as clergymen, physicians, attorneys and nurses. Persons in these positions are often in a position to influence the death-bed testator; and, bequests to such persons in their individual capacities lack the \u201cfacial legitimacy\u201d of bequests that are expressly designated for \u201ccharitable\u201d purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">Based upon all of the foregoing, we cannot conclude that former R.C. 2107.06 is <em>rationally related </em>to the accomplishment of a legitimate state objective. The legislature apparently reached a similar conclusion when it repealed R.C. 2107.06 effective August 1, 1985. Although this court upheld the constitutionality of a predecessor to R.C. 2107.06 in <em>Patton </em>v. <em>Patton </em>(1883), 39 Ohio St. 590, it did so by rejecting a challenge to the statute that was based upon the First Amendment right to acquire, possess and protect one\u2019s property.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Until today, this court has not scrutinized Ohio\u2019s mortmain statute by application of a modern, equal protection analysis. We hold that R.C. 2107.06 does not withstand such scrutiny.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-7\">According to the brief of the appellee Attorney General, only four states \u201ccurrently have valid mortmain statutes.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The demise of mortmain has been brought about both by legislative repeal and judicial decision. See, <em>e.g., In re Estate of Kinyon </em>(Mont. 1980), 615 P. 2d 74; <em>In re Estate of Cavill </em>(1974), 459 Pa. 411, 329 A. 2d 503; <em>Estate of French </em>(D.C. App. 1976), 365 A. 2d 621. Ohio\u2019s Legislature has repealed this state\u2019s mortmain statute effective August 1, 1985; and, we hold that former R.C. 2107.06, as applied to any action seeking construction of that statute pending on the date of this decision or to the last will of any testator <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>whose death occurred on or after August 1, 1985, is violative of the Equal Protection Clauses of the Ohio and United States Constitutions.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">Based upon this holding we decline to address Shriners\u2019 challenge to R.C. 2107.06 under the Free Exercise Clauses of the Ohio and United States Constitutions. We also decline to adopt or address the doctrine of dependent relative revocation.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> While this doctrine may have merit, we believe it would be unwise to adopt a doctrine, potentially having application in a variety of cases that are not before us, solely to remedy the injustice of the instant case, which was wrought by an unreasonable statute that lacks the requisite degree of rationality to withstand constitutional scrutiny.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">Accordingly, the judgment of the court of appeals is affirmed, but for the reasons stated herein, and the cause is remanded to the trial court for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed and cause remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b230-8\">Celebrezze, C.J, Locher, Holmes, C.
