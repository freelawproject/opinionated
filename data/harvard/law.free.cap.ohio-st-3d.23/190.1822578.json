In support of this contention, appellant submits that subdivision (A)(5) survives the exception under subdivision (D)(2)(b)(i) as construed in <em>Craft </em>v. <em>Giles, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b218-19\">In <em>Craft, </em>upon facts virtually identical to those presented in the cause <em>sub judice, </em>the Court of Appeals for Mercer County first concluded that, pursuant to R.C. 4141.29(A)(5), an employee is not entitled to benefits unless he is unable to procure suitable work. The court then analyzed R.C. 4141.29(D) as follows: first, the court correctly observed that if an employee, without good cause, refuses to accept an offer for suitable work, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>then pursuant to subdivision (D)(2)(b), that employee forfeits the right to receive benefits or to serve a waiting period <em>for the duration </em>of his unemployment; next, the court reasoned that the exception contained under subdivision (b)(i), providing that no disqualification results when an employee rejects an offer of employment by his employer, pursuant to the terms of a labor-management contract, simply means that no disqualification for the duration of the unemployment term will result ii such offer is refused; but, the court concluded that an employer\u2019s offer of alternative employment will serve to disqualify the employee from receiving unemployment benefits for the week in which the offer is extended. According to the court in <em>Graft, </em>this interpretation is \u201cconsistent with the purpose of the [Unemployment Compensation] Act,\u201d and furthers the state\u2019s as well as an employee\u2019s interest in accepting employment opportunities.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-6\">The interpretation of R.C. 4141.29(D)(2)(b)(i) as espoused in <em>Craft </em>was rejected by the court of appeals in the present cause, as well as by the Court of Appeals for Pike County in <em>Conley </em>v. <em>Bd. of Review </em>(Feb. 21, 1980), Pike App. No. 306, unreported. We are likewise compelled to reject that line of reasoning.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-7\">In 1973, R.C. 4141.29(A) provided, as it does today, that in order for a claimant to be eligible for benefits he must be \u201cunable to obtain suitable work.\u201d At that time, R.C. 4141.29(D) provided that notwithstanding subdivision (A), benefits were not payable for any week where the unemployment was the result of a labor dispute, worker misconduct, or the refusal to accept without good cause an offer for suitable employment. In January 1974, subsection (D)(2)(a) was amended as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b219-8\">\u201c[An employee will not receive benefits] [f]or the duration of his unemployment if the administrator finds that:</p>\n<p id=\"b219-9\">\u201c(a) He quit his work -without just cause or has been discharged for just cause in connection with his work, provided * * * this section does not apply to the separation of a person under any of the following circumstances:</p>\n<p id=\"b219-10\">\u201c(ii) Separation from employment pursuant to a labor-management contract * * * or pursuant to an established employer plan * * * which permits the employee, because of lack of work, to accept a separation from employment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b219-11\">In addition, R.C. 4141.29(D)(2)(b) was amended in 1974 to provide as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b219-12\">\u201c[An employee will not receive benefits] [f]or the duration of his unemployment if the administrator finds that: <em>U* </em>* *</p>\n<p id=\"b219-14\">\u201c(b) He has refused without good cause to accept an offer of suitable work when made by an employer * * * <em>provided, that this division shall </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number><em>not cause a disqualification for </em>* * * <em>benefits under the following circumstances:</em></p>\n<p id=\"b220-4\">\u201c(i) When work is offered by his employer and he is not required to accept the offer pursuant to the terms of the labor-management contract or agreement, or pursuant to an established employer plan, program or policy.\u201d (Emphasis added.) (135 Ohio Laws, Part I, 201, 242-243.)</p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">The intent of the General Assembly as evidenced by the foregoing amendments is clear and unambiguous. That is, when an employee elects pursuant to a labor-management agreement not to accept an offer for alternative employment offered by the employer, the employee is not disqualified under subdivision (D)(2)(a) for having \u201cquit his work without just cause,\u201d nor is he disqualified pursuant to subdivision (D)(2)(b) for having refused without good cause to accept an offer of suitable work. To accept appellant\u2019s contention that an employee who exercises his election under subdivision (D)(2)(b)(i) is somehow prevented by subdivision (A)(5) from receiving benefits would be to ignore the similarities between the two sections and effectively excise the later provisions from the statute. For as the court in <em>Conley </em>observed, the requirement under subdivision (A)(5) that a claimant be \u201cunable to obtain suitable work\u201d is essentially restated under subdivision (D)(2)(b) which provides that an employee may not receive benefits for the duration of his unemployment if \u201c[h]e has refused without good cause to accept an offer of suitable work.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">Furthermore, as was stated in <em>Conley, </em>\u201c[i]n creating the exception to the basic requirement that the non-acceptance of work pursuant to a labor-management contract shall not operate as a refusal to accept suitable work, it would be, in our view, paradoxical that the General Assembly intended to nevertheless disqualify the claimant pursuant to subsection (A)(5). In sum, such an interpretation would render the exception [under R.C. 4141.29(D)(2)(b)(i)] meaningless and negate its effect.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 4-5.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-7\">It is firmly established in Ohio \u201cthat words used in a statute are to be given their plain and ordinary meaning, unless the legislative intent indicates otherwise.\u201d <em>Ohio Assn. of Pub. School Emp. </em>v. <em>Twin Valley Local School Dist. Bd. of Edn. </em>(1983), 6 Ohio St. 3d 178, 181. Moreover, \u201c[i]n determining legislative intent it is the duty of this court to give effect to the words used [in a statute], not to delete words used or to insert words not used.\u201d <em>Columbus-Suburban Coach Lines </em>v. <em>Pub. Util. Comm. </em>(1969), 20 Ohio St. 2d 125, 127 [49 O.O.2d 445]. See, also, <em>Dougherty </em>v. <em>Torrence </em>(1982), 2 Ohio St. 3d 69, 70. The judgment of the court below gives effect to the clear and unambiguous language contained within R.C. 4141.29(D)(2)(b)(i) and, unlike the judgment in <em>Craft, </em>does not attempt to delete language from this provision and insert in its place the provisions of subdivision (A)(5). Accordingly, the court of appeals properly concluded that the clear import of R.C. 4141.29(D)(2)(b)(i) constitutes an exception to the general requirement under subsection (A)(5) that benefits are not available unless the employee is unable to obtain suitable work.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>For the foregoing reasons the judgment of the court of appeals is hereby affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b221-6\">Celebrezze, C.J., Sweeney, Locher, Holmes, C. Brown, Douglas and Wright, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b221-7\">Holmes, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"A_X\">concurring. The legislative history of the particular statute involved here would seem to clearly show the intent of the General Assembly. R.C. 4141.29, as amended, must reasonably be interpreted to mean that a waiver of bumping privilege, or other provision exempting the employee from accepting an offer of certain type of work, which provision is contained within a labor-management contract, creates an exception to the general rule which would, absent the contract, require a denial of unemployment benefits, in that the employee otherwise would be able \u201cto obtain suitable work.\u201d</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
