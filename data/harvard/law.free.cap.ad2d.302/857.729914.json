Plaintiff commenced this action alleging that the ice had formed after she came home at approximately 4:00 p.m. and before she fell at approximately 8:00 p.m. and that she was unable to see the ice because a light bulb in one of the two lights illuminating the driveway had burned out.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-8\">Supreme Court properly denied defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment dismissing the complaint. Defendant failed to establish as a matter of law that she lacked constructive notice of the patch of ice on the driveway <em>(see generally Gordon v American Museum of Natural History, </em>67 NY2d 836, 837-838), that she had no duty to provide reasonable illumination to the exterior of the duplex home <em>(see Miccoli v Kotz, </em>278 AD2d 460) and that her failure to replace the light bulb was not a proximate cause of plaintiffs injuries <em>(see id.). </em>Present \u2014 Pigott, Jr., P.J., Pine, Wisner, Kehoe and Gorski, JJ.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
