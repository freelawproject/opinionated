During that period, petitioner\u2019s 17-year-old daughter was employed while a full-time student. The following November, the municipal respondent discovered petitioner\u2019s name on the Department of Taxation\u2019s State Wage Reporting System, from which the municipal respondent is statutorily authorized to obtain information about earned income. If this Reporting System generates wage information that may affect an individual\u2019s public assistance eligibility, the individual must verify or explain the information. The State Wage Reporting System\u2019s report indicated that petitioner\u2019s 17-year-old daughter had an income. Consequently, the municipal respondent sent petitioner a \u201cRequest for Information About Earned Income\u201d form to be completed and returned by December 9, 2000. The Request states that failing to return the form by the specified date may affect continued receipt of benefits. Petitioner failed to return the Request, and, in a notice dated Janu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>ary 10, 2001, the municipal respondent informed petitioner that her benefits were discontinued.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-3\">On February 12, 2001, the respondent state agency held a fair hearing before an administrative law judge (ALJ) upon petitioner\u2019s appeal of the municipal respondent\u2019s determination. Petitioner was represented at the hearing by a community specialist for a community organization providing assistance to her. Petitioner testified that her daughter, who was back in school, was no longer working. In addition, petitioner explained that she forgot to return the Request for Information because she \u201cforget[s] everything\u201d and \u201csuffer[s] from anxiety.\u201d Petitioner\u2019s representative submitted medical documentation substantiating petitioner\u2019s condition. The medical report indicates that petitioner was diagnosed with major depression and was taking two kinds of medication daily for her condition. In addition, the report states that petitioner is \u201ceasily overwhelmed,\u201d suffered a \u201crecent relapse of depressive symptoms,\u201d and was \u201cpresently acutely depressed and dysfunctional.\u201d Petitioner\u2019s representative explained that she did not return the form because she is \u201cmedically unfit\u201d and that his organization was trying to help her.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-4\">The ALJ determined that petitioner\u2019s reason for failing to return the questionnaire did not constitute \u201cgood cause,\u201d as defined by state regulation, to exempt her from complying with the eligibility requirement of returning the Request for Information About Earned Income. Accordingly, the ALJ upheld the municipal respondent\u2019s determination that petitioner was ineligible for public assistance, medical assistance and food stamp benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">It is well settled that \u201cin order to annul an administrative determination made after a * * * hearing a court must be satisfied, after reviewing the record as a whole, that the record lacks substantial evidence to support the determination\u201d <em>(Matter of Lahey v Kelly, </em>71 NY2d 135, 140 [1987]; <em>accord Matter of Berenhaus v Ward, </em>70 NY2d 436, 442-443 [1987]; <em>300 Gramatan Ave. Assoc. v State Div. of Human Rights, </em>45 NY2d 176, 181-182 [1978]; <em>see also </em>CPLR 7803 [4]). The question here is whether there exists \u201csuch relevant proof as a reasonable mind may accept as adequate to support a conclusion or ultimate fact\u201d <em>(300 Gramatan Ave. Assoc., </em>45 NY2d at 180) to uphold the ALJ\u2019s determination that petitioner did not have \u201cgood cause\u201d for failing to return the-Request for Information About Earned Income. Upon our review of the record, we find no basis to support the ALJ\u2019s determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-6\">The New York regulations (18 NYCRR 351.26) provide in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>relevant part that: \u201c(a) An applicant for or recipient of public assistance is exempt from complying with any requirement concerning eligibility for public assistance if the applicant or recipient establishes that good cause exists for failing to comply with the requirement. * * * [G]ood cause for failure to comply with an eligibility requirement exists when: (1) the applicant * * * has a physical or mental condition which prevents compliance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b239-4\">In view of the specific medical documentation and testimony adduced at the hearing, and the lack of any evidence to the contrary, the ALJ\u2019s determination that petitioner did not have good cause, that is, a mental condition, is not supported by any facts or reasonable inferences that can be drawn from the record. We reject the state respondent\u2019s contention that depression is not a \u201cmental condition\u201d as defined by the regulations. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV, at 320 [4th ed]) states that the essential feature of a major depressive episode is a period of at least two weeks during which there is either a depressed mood or the loss of interest or pleasure in nearly all activities. In addition, the individual experiences at least four other standard symptoms which include decreased energy and difficulty in thinking, concentrating or making decisions <em>(id.). </em>The state regulation expressly includes \u201cmental condition,\u201d a category in which depression, and particularly \u201cacute\u201d depression, clearly falls. The state respondent\u2019s contention that the regulation should be narrowly interpreted is irrational and contrary to its plain meaning <em>(cf. Howard v Wyman, </em>28 NY2d 434, 438 [1971]).</p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">Regrettably, this is not the first time we have found that an administrative agency, in the context of its mission to assist genuinely disadvantaged and disabled people, has used a person\u2019s incapacity against her <em>(see e.g. Matter of Padilla v Martinez, </em>300 AD2d 96 [2002] [clear from record that petitioner was incapable of representing herself adequately and equally clear that she was prejudiced by the Housing Authority\u2019s exploitation of her mental incapacity]). Moreover, we have recently had the occasion to recognize that although \u201cour review powers are severely restricted with respect to an administrative agency determination, we are nevertheless charged with insuring that an agency meet the very minimal evidentiary requirement necessary to uphold its determination\u201d <em>(Matter of Scully v Safir, </em>282 AD2d 305, 308 [2001]). Under no view of the evidence can this administrative determination be upheld. This is that \u201crare case that utterly fails to satisfy the substantial evidence standard\u201d <em>(id.). </em>Concur \u2014 Andrias, J.P., Saxe, Buckley, Rosenberger and Marlow, JJ.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
