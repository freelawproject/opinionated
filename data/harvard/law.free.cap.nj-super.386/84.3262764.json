After being found guilty in the municipal court of Manville, defendant appealed to the Law Division, where a trial de novo again resulted in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>defendant\u2019s conviction. He was sentenced just as he was in municipal court to an eight-month loss of driving privileges. Motor vehicle offenses of careless driving, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:4-97, and failure to wear a seatbelt, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:3-76.3, were merged with defendant\u2019s DWI conviction. Defendant also was required to complete an alcohol counseling program and the Intoxicated Driver Resource Center Program.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> All of defendant\u2019s penalties, with the exception of his continued alcohol counseling, have been stayed pending appeal. We now reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b116-7\">Evidence adduced at trial supports these facts. At approximately 6:40 p.m. on December 3, 2003, Sergeant Jeffrey Petrone of the Manville Police Department was dispatched to the scene of a one-car motor vehicle accident on Dukes Parkway. Upon his arrival at the scene of the accident, Sergeant Petrone observed a white Pontiac Grand Am automobile resting against a utility pole. The windshield of the car was cracked, and defendant, Richard F. Berezansky, was inside the vehicle, bleeding from the head. Sergeant Petrone noticed that defendant was shaking, and the officer detected alcohol on his breath. Defendant informed Sergeant Petrone that he had had two beers and that he suffered from Parkinson\u2019s disease. Because he was concerned for defendant\u2019s health, Sergeant Petrone did not perform any psychophysical tests to determine whether defendant was intoxicated prior to his being transported to Somerset Medical Center.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-8\">Sergeant Petrone followed defendant to the hospital, where the officer requested a blood sample from defendant to determine his blood alcohol level. Sergeant Petrone supplied a signed blood alcohol request form; the laboratory technician and a nurse who was present when defendant\u2019s blood was drawn also signed the form. The technician then capped the vials of defendant\u2019s blood <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>and handed them to Sergeant Petrone. He placed the vials in a cardboard box, which he sealed and returned to police headquarters. Upon his arrival at police headquarters, Sergeant Petrone placed the box inside a locked metal box in the evidence refrigerator. He then placed the key to the box in the evidence locker for the custodian of evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-6\">Detective Michael Guilbert<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> is the custodian of evidence for the Manville Police Department. Detective Guilbert testified that he was the only person who had access to the sample while it was held in police headquarters. On the evening of December 3, Detective Guilbert entered information about the evidence into a computer and sent that information to the New Jersey State Police Laboratory. At approximately 2:00 p.m. on December 4, 2005, Detective Guilbert removed the samples from the cardboard box, placed the vials into a bag, heat-sealed the bag, and transported it to the New Jersey Police Laboratory in Trenton, commonly referred to as the Central Regional Laboratory. Detective Guilbert gave the samples to Megan Williams, a clerk at the laboratory, who signed for the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-7\">Defendant\u2019s blood, however, was actually tested at the State Police South Regional Laboratory rather than the Central Regional Laboratory. Detective Guilbert could not explain how defendant\u2019s blood samples were transported from the Central Regional Laboratory to the South Regional Laboratory; indeed, Detective Guilbert stated that he had no idea where the South Regional Laboratory was located.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-8\">The laboratory certificate indicated that the sample of defendant\u2019s blood contained a blood alcohol level of 0.33%, more than three times the 0.10% threshold then set by statute. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:4\u201450a(1)(ii).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Over defendant\u2019s objection, the trial judge found <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>that the laboratory certificate was properly admitted into evidence under the business records exception to the hearsay rule. <em>N.J.R.E. </em>803(c)(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b118-6\">In letters addressed to the municipal prosecutor for the Borough of Manville, dated December 19, 2003 and January 26, 2004, defendant gave notice that he questioned the chain of custody of his blood sample and expressed his intention to confront the custodian. In the December 19, 2003 letter, defendant demanded the preservation and production of the unused portion of his blood sample, stating that he sought the blood sample in order to obtain independent testing and analysis. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>39:4-50.2(c) and (d). Defendant reiterated those demands in a subsequent letter to the municipal prosecutor dated January 26, 2004. Detective Guilbert testified that he received the final evidence report from the State Police Laboratory, but he did not seek or obtain any vials of defendant\u2019s unused blood and was not requested to do so by the municipal prosecutor.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-7\">The State failed to produce any evidence in discovery or at trial to establish how or why defendant\u2019s blood samples were transported from the Central Regional Laboratory to the South Regional Laboratory. The laboratory certificate, which is dated December 24, 2003, states that the laboratory\u2019s policy is to destroy unused portions of a sample ninety days after the date of the final report. Defendant\u2019s multiple requests for the sample were transmitted to the municipal prosecutor well within the ninety-day period. The record does not provide any information about the maintenance or disposal of the remainder of the sample defendant sought to test.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-8\">The State also failed to comply with defendant\u2019s requests for documentation pertaining to the laboratory certificate or the tests performed. In his December 19 letter, defendant demanded the notes of the chemist who performed the analysis on defendant\u2019s blood and all graphs and printouts related to the analysis. Defendant\u2019s January 26, 2004 letter to the municipal prosecutor repeated that demand. The State failed to supply this documentation.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>Defendant twice demanded a speedy trial, first in his December 19, 2003 letter to the municipal prosecutor and second in a March 10, 2004 letter addressed to the municipal court administrator. The municipal court trial began on May 6,2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b119-7\">On appeal, defendant presents these arguments:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b119-8\">POINT I</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b119-9\">DEFENDANT\u2019S CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO CONFRONT THE WITNESS AGAINST HIM WAS VIOLATED WHEN THE TRIAL COURT IMPROPERLY ADMITTED THE STATE POLICE LABORATORY REPORT INTO EVIDENCE WITHOUT TESTIMONY FROM THE CHEMIST WHO PERFORMED THE ANALYSIS AND PREPARED THE REPORT.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b119-10\">POINT II</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b119-11\">THE LABORATORY REPORT WAS IMPROPERLY ADMITTED INTO EVIDENCE BECAUSE THE STATE FAILED TO ESTABLISH THE CHAIN OF CUSTODY THAT BROUGHT THE BLOOD EVIDENCE TO THE STATE POLICE LABORATORY WHERE IT WAS ALLEGEDLY TESTED.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b119-12\">POINT III</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b119-13\">DEFENDANT\u2019S DUE PROCESS RIGHTS WERE VIOLATED BY THE STATE\u2019S FAILURE TO PRESERVE AND MAKE AVAILABLE THE DEFENDANT\u2019S BLOOD SAMPLE FOR INDEPENDENT BLOOD TESTING.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b119-14\">POINT IV</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b119-15\">DEFENDANT\u2019S CONVICTION MUST BE REVERSED AS A RESULT OF THE STATE\u2019S DENIAL OF THE DEFENDANT\u2019S RIGHT TO A SPEEDY TRIAL.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b119-16\">We have carefully considered the record in light of defendant\u2019s contentions on appeal, and we are convinced that defendant\u2019s right of confrontation was violated by the admission of the laboratory certificate without giving defendant an opportunity to confront its preparer. We therefore reverse defendant\u2019s conviction and remand for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-17\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b119-18\">Defendant argues that the admission of the lab certificate without the testimony of its preparer violated his constitutional right of confrontation because he was denied the opportunity to cross-examine the chemist who analyzed the sample and prepared <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>the certificate. The State claims that the lab certificate was properly admitted as a business record under <em>N.J.R.E. </em>803(c)(6) and as a public record under <em>N.J.R.E. </em>803(c)(8).</p>\n<p id=\"b120-6\">The Sixth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States and article I, paragraph 10 of the New Jersey Constitution each guarantee a criminal defendant \u201cthe right ... to be confronted with the witnesses against him.\u201d In <em>Crawford, v. Washington, </em>541 <em>U.S. </em>36, 124 <em>S.Ct. </em>1354, 158 L.Ed.2d 177 (2004), the United States Supreme Court addressed the protections afforded by the Confrontation Clause.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The defendant in <em>Crawford </em>was charged with assault and attempted murder; defendant was convicted of assault. <em>Id. </em>at 38, 124 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1357, 158 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 184. The trial judge admitted a tape-recorded statement of the defendant\u2019s wife, given to police while she was herself a suspect, after the judge found the statement reliable. <em>Id. </em>at 38-40, 124 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1356-58, 158 <em>L.Ed.2</em>d at 184-86.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-7\">The Court held that \u201c[a]dmitting statements deemed reliable by a judge is fundamentally at odds with the right of confrontation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 61, 124 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1370, 158 L.Ed.2d at 199. \u201cDispensing with confrontation because testimony is obviously reliable is akin to dispensing with jury trial because a defendant is obviously guilty.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 62, 124 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1371, 158 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 199. The Court reversed defendant\u2019s conviction. <em>Id. </em>at 68-69, 124 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1374, 158 L.Ed.2d at 203. In <em>Crawford, </em>the Court\u2019s express holding applied only to \u201ctestimonial\u201d evidence:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-8\">Where nontestimonial hearsay is at issue, it is wholly consistent with the Framers\u2019 design to afford the States flexibility in their development of hearsay law \u2014 ... as would an approach that exempted such statements from Confrontation Clause scrutiny altogether. Where testimonial evidence is at issue, however, the Sixth Amendment demands what the common law required: unavailability and a prior opportunity for cross-examination. We leave for another day any effort to spell out a comprehensive definition of \u201ctestimonial.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-9\">[541 <em>U.S. </em>at 68, 124 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1374, 158 L.Ed.2d at 203 (footnote omitted) ].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A3B\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>We need not fill in the definition left open by the Supreme Court to be guided by the Court\u2019s concerns for the right of confrontation as expressed in <em>Crawford.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b121-6\">Neither the New Jersey Criminal Code nor the Eules of Evidence includes a specific provision for the admission of a lab certificate reporting the result of a blood test for alcohol content. There is, however, a Code provision for the admission of a certificate reporting the result of testing for a controlled dangerous substance. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:35-19. In <em>State v. Simbara, </em>175 <em>N.J. </em>37, 48, 811 A.2d 448 (2002), the Supreme Court addressed that statute, specifically, the defendant\u2019s right to require the preparer\u2019s testimony and availability for cross-examination as a precondition for admitting the certificate.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-7\">In <em>Simbara, </em>the State sought to admit a lab certificate as evidence \u201cto demonstrate the nature and weight of an alleged controlled dangerous substance ... possessed by [the] defendant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 40, 811 A.2d 448. At a pre-trial hearing to determine the admissibility of the certificate, the defendant challenged the testing procedures and mechanisms utilized by the lab. <em>Id. </em>at 40-41, 811 A.2d 448. Without offering the testimony of the technician who performed the analysis or an employee familiar with the testing procedures, the State argued that the certificate was reliable because the laboratory complied with <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:35-19.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number><em>Id. </em>at 41, 811 A.2d 448. The trial judge denied the admission of the laboratory certificate; we reversed and held the certificate admissible; the Supreme Court again reversed and held that the certificate was erroneously admitted. <em>Id. </em>at 42, 811 A.2d 448.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-6\">The Court noted the Attorney General\u2019s directive respecting the State\u2019s use of such laboratory certificates:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-7\">[Wjhen and if the prosecutor decides in a particular case to file a formal notice of intent to use a laboratory certificate as trial evidence pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:35-19, the laboratory must compile and transmit to the prosecutor a copy of all reports or other documents prepared by or in the possession of the laboratory that pertain to the examination of the controlled dangerous substance in question. In these circumstances, the documents that must be transmitted to the prosecuting agency by the laboratory would include: a copy of the request for examination of evidence; all reports and notes prepared by the scientist; the underlying data used to reach conclusions concerning the composition and quantity of the substance submitted for examination, and any graphs, charts or computer printouts that describe the results of any manual or automated test of the substance submitted for examination.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-8\">If the prosecutor intends to proffer a sworn laboratory certificate at trial pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:35-19, the prosecutor must, pursuant to the literal requirements of the statute, convey to defense counsel a copy of the certificate along with all of the foregoing documents. In addition, in order to ensure that laboratory certificates are admissible as evidence at trial, forensic laboratories must make available for inspection by defense counsel all manuals, standard operating procedures or written protocols developed or relied upon by the laboratory concerning the forensic tests at issue or concerning the use, operation and maintenance of the equipment used to perform the analyses.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number><em>[Id. </em>at 44, 811 A.2d 448 (quoting Memorandum from Peter C. Harvey, First Assistant Attorney General, to County Prosecutors at 1-2 (Aug. 22, 2002)).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b123-5\">The Court found that the Attorney General\u2019s directive \u201creflect[ed] a reasonable interpretation of the statute\u2019s requirements.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>The Court also held that even strict compliance with <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:35-19 and the Attorney General\u2019s directive does not automatically establish the admissibility of a laboratory certificate. <em>Id. </em>at 46, 811 A.2d 448. Additionally, the Court held that a defendant who has received the required documentation nonetheless retains the right to challenge the reliability of the certificate, <em>id. </em>at 48, 811 A.2d 448, and \u201cthe State is obligated to produce the certificate\u2019s preparer whenever a defendant timely invokes his or her right to confront that <em>witness____\u201d Id. </em>at 40, 811 A.2d 448; <em>see also State in the Interest of C.D., </em>354 <em>N.J.Super. </em>457, 463, 808 A.2d 123 (App.Div.2002) (after a defendant objects to admission of a laboratory certificate in a drug case, the statute \u201cvanishes as a determinative to admissibility in evidence of the laboratory certificate.\u201d). Thus, the defendant in <em>Simbara </em>was granted a new trial and given \u201cthe opportunity to renew his challenge to the certificate in view of the supplemental information furnished under the Attorney General\u2019s directive.\u201d <em>Simbara, supra, </em>175 <em>N.J. </em>at 49, 811 A.2d 448.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-8\">Years before <em>Crawford </em>or <em>Simbara, </em>in an appeal from a conviction for drunk driving, we explained our concern about admitting a laboratory certificate attesting to the defendant\u2019s blood alcohol content, under an exception to the hearsay rule:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-9\">[T]he evidence sought to be admitted was produced by a governmental agency whose business is the prosecution of crime____Unlike [a] hospital laboratory ... which exists primarily as an aid to diagnosis and treatment of patients, a police laboratory exists to test and produce evidence tor governmental prosecuting agencies. The difference is a major one, which bears on the neutrality and thus the reliability of the laboratory analyses. We see no reason to interpret <em>Evid.Il. </em>63(13) and 63(15)(a) [predecessors to <em>N.J.R.E. </em>803(c)(6) and (8), hearsay exceptions for business and governmental records] as an effort to abandon the adversarial trial process in favor of blind reliance on the skill and good intentions of prosecuting agencies.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-12\">[State <em>v. Flynn, </em>202 <em>N.J.Super. </em>215, 219-20, 494 A.2d 350 (App.Div.1985), <em>remanded, </em>103 <em>N.J. </em>446, 511 A.2d 634 (1986) (to be reconsidered in light of <em>State v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number><em>Matulewicz, </em>101 <em>N.J. </em>27, 499 A.2d 1363 (1985)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>, <em>rev\u2019d on remand sub nom. State v. Weller, </em>225 <em>N.J.Super. </em>274, 276, 542 A.2d 55 (Law Div.1986)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>],</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b124-7\">We reject the State\u2019s reliance upon the business record or government record exceptions to the hearsay rule to permit the admission of this lab certificate. The rationale for those exceptions is that such a document is likely to be reliable because it was prepared and preserved in the ordinary course of the operation of a business or governmental entity, and not created primarily as evidence for trial. <em>See N.J.R.E. </em>803(c)(6). <em>See generally </em>Biunno, <em>Current N.J. Rules of Evidence, </em>comment 1 to <em>N.J.R.E. </em>803(c)(6); comment 2 to <em>N.J.R.E. </em>803(c)(8) (2005). The certificate at issue is not a record prepared or maintained in the ordinary course of government business; it was prepared specifically in order to prove an element of the crime and offered in lieu of producing the qualified individual who actually performed the test.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-8\">Here, defendant not only was denied his constitutional right to confront the certificate\u2019s preparer, he was not even afforded an adequate opportunity to challenge the certificate\u2019s reliability, because the State failed to provide requested documentation regarding the laboratory analysis of the blood. <em>See id. </em>at 44-45, 811 A.2d 448. By analogy, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:35-19c requires the prosecutor to provide a defendant with all documentation relating to a proffered lab certificate as a condition for admission of that certificate attesting to the identification of a controlled dangerous substance. The purpose of that requirement is to \u201callow the opposing party a fair opportunity to make an informed decision <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>whether to contest the admissibility of the certificate.\u201d <em>State v. Miller, 170 N.J. </em>417, 430, 790 A.2d 144 (2002).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-6\">[W]hen the state offers the lab certificate, it essentially is proffering inadmissible hearsay evidence to prove an element of the criminal case against a defendant. In order to use that evidence and not run afoul of the Confrontation Clause, the State must obtain defendant\u2019s consent, or failing that, must justify its admission at a hearing. <em>Matulemcz, supra. N.J.S.A. </em>2C:35-19 does not and cannot affect the State\u2019s burden and certainly does not shift that burden to defendant. It merely serves to put the State on notice of those cases in which a defendant will not consent to the admission of the lab report and with respect to which the State must be prepared to produce an expert witness at trial or prove why one is not necessary. The obligation of defendant under the statute is to notify the State of his refusal <em>to </em>stipulate to the lab report and to assert that the lab results (composition, quality or quantity of the tested substance) will be contested at trial. <em>[Miller, supra, </em>170 <em>N.J. </em>at 432, 790 A.2d 144].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b125-7\">The State clearly failed here to meet the standards established in <em>Simbara </em>for admission of a drug test certificate. The Court has not had occasion to apply the same substantive standards to the admission of a blood alcohol test certificate offered to prove a DWI charge. We recognize that <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:35-19, as well as <em>Simbara </em>and <em>Miller, </em>literally address only a drug test certificate. We fail, however, to see any reasonable basis for holding the State to a lesser standard, or according a defendant lesser rights, with respect to use of such a certificate as evidence of an essential element of the DWI offense. As we observed in <em>State v. Flynn, </em>\u201cthe neutrality and thus the reliability\u201d of an analysis performed at a State laboratory cannot be presumed because \u201ca police laboratory exists to test and produce evidence for governmental prosecuting agencies,\u201d and the business of the governmental agency seeking the admission of the evidence is \u201cthe prosecution of the crime.\u201d <em>Flynn, supra, </em>202 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 219-20, 494 A.2d 350.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-8\">The State\u2019s reliance on our decision in <em>State v. Oliveri, </em>336 <em>N.J.Super. </em>244, 764 A.2d 489 (App.Div.2001) (affirming drug conviction despite challenge to laboratory certificate), is not persuasive. Significantly, in affirming the Law Division decision convicting the defendant in <em>Oliveri, </em>we noted the municipal judge\u2019s alternative finding in that case: that irrespective of the lab certificate, there was sufficient observation evidence offered by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>the police to establish that defendant was driving while intoxicated. <em>Id. </em>at 251, 764 A.2d 489. We decided <em>Oliveri </em>prior to and thus without the benefit of the decisions in <em>Simbara </em>or <em>Crawford. </em>Nonetheless, to the extent that <em>Oliveri </em>may appear to conflict with either, we are bound by the decisions of both higher courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-6\">The State\u2019s argument here \u2014 that defendant\u2019s request to challenge the lab certificate was not sufficiently particular \u2014 is entirely without merit. In <em>Miller, supra, </em>170 <em>N.J. </em>at 425, 790 A.2d 144, the Court considered a similar argument by the State after it failed to provide documentation relevant to the challenged certificate. The Court observed that to adopt the State\u2019s argument would place the defendant in a \u201cCatch-22.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 434-35, 790 A.2d 144. \u201cWhen a defendant attempts to surmount the barrier, he finds himself in the untenable position of having to identify \u2018specific grounds\u2019 in order to confront the analyst, but being unable to confront the analyst in order to identify the \u2018specific grounds.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 435, 790 A.2d 144 (quoting <em>Miller v. State, </em>266 <em>Ga. </em>850, 472 <em>S.E.2d </em>74, 79 (1996)). Here, defendant asserted his right to \u201ccontest at trial the composition, quality and quantity of substances submitted to the laboratory for analysis.\u201d The New Jersey Supreme Court in <em>Miller </em>held that \u201cto avoid constitutional infirmity ... <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:35-19c [must be read] to require only that a defendant object to the lab certificate and assert that the composition, quality or quantity of the tested substance will be contested at trial.\u201d 170 <em>N.J. </em>at 436, 790 A.2d 144. Defendant\u2019s demand here was sufficiently particular to convey his intention to exercise his right of confrontation.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-7\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b126-8\">Defendant argues that it was error to admit the lab certificate into evidence when the State failed to establish the chain of custody. Defendant specifically noted the lack of evidence that it was his blood sample that was identified, secured, and transferred from the Central Regional Laboratory to the South Regional Laboratory. The State\u2019s burden to demonstrate a proper chain of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>custody is of particular importance with respect to laboratory certificates. <em>See Simbara, supra, </em>175 <em>N.J. </em>at 49, 811 <em>A.2d </em>448. On remand, the State shall have the opportunity to offer evidence to supply the missing link in the chain of custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b127-6\">Defendant argues that his right to due process also was denied as a result of the State\u2019s failure to provide him with the remaining portion of his blood sample after the State laboratory had performed its analysis. The State responds that there is no evidence of bad faith in the destruction of the remaining blood, and therefore no due process violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-7\">In light of our determination that defendant\u2019s conviction must be reversed on other grounds, we need not decide whether the State\u2019s failure to provide defendant with a blood sample constituted a violation of due process that independently requires reversal. Because we expect this issue to arise again on remand, we offer these comments.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-8\">The State relies on <em>State v. Casele, </em>198 <em>N.J.Super. </em>462, 471, 487 A.2d 765 (App.Div.1985) (affirming a conviction for death by auto), to demonstrate that defendant\u2019s right to due process was not violated by the destruction of his blood sample. In <em>C\u00e1sele, </em>we applied a three-prong test to determine whether the State\u2019s failure to preserve and supply defendant with his own blood sample constituted a due process violation. <em>Id. </em>at 469-70, 487 A.2d 765. The three factors were: \u201c(1) whether the evidence was material to the issues of guilt or punishment; (2) whether defendant was prejudiced by its destruction; and (3) whether the government had acted in bad faith when it destroyed it.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 470, 487 A.2d 765. Having considered those factors, we held: \u201c[TJhere being no evidence of bad faith on behalf of the prosecution nor any evidence that the samples would have been material to the defense or that defendant was prejudiced by the destruction of the blood samples, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>there was no error in admitting the test results into evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 471, 487 A.2d 765.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b128-6\">In <em>Casele, </em>the defendant did not request the unused portion of the sample until six months after the original test, when testing apparently could have yielded less accurate results than the initial test. <em>Id. </em>at 470, 487 A.2d 765. We also noted that the \u201c[djefendant had every opportunity to question the test results without resort to the evidence itself both by cross-examination of the State\u2019s witnesses and through its own expert\u2019s testimony,\u201d and we found that the State appeared to have acted in good faith. <em>Ibid. </em>Moreover, the individual who performed the test testified at trial in <em>C\u00e1sele </em>that the entire sample was used up in testing. <em>Id. </em>at 467, 487 A.2d 765. That witness was, obviously, subject to cross-examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-7\">Our decisions in <em>State v. Mercer, </em>211 <em>N.J.Super. </em>388, 393-94, 511 A.2d 1233 (App.Div.1986), and <em>State v. Kaye, </em>176 <em>N.J.Super. </em>484, 490, 423 A.2d 1002 (App.Div.1980), <em>certif. denied, </em>87 <em>N.J. </em>316, 434 A.2d 69 (1981), are informative. In each case, the defendant claimed a denial of due process because the State failed to provide a portion of the defendant\u2019s blood sample. In <em>Mercer, </em>we concluded that the defendant had an adequate opportunity to attack the State\u2019s test results by other means, and there was no suggestion that the State had acted in bad faith by destroying the remainder of the specimen. <em>Id. </em>at 394, 511 A.2d 1233. Similarly, in <em>Kaye, </em>we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b128-8\">We hold to the view that where an entire sample of a specimen, such as blood, is, as here, in good faith, consumed or destroyed during the testing process by a recognized law enforcement or other qualified laboratory, the consumption or destruction of the specimen does not constitute an act of suppression of evidence by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>the State sufficient to trigger a due process violation, warranting the suppression of the test results.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b129-7\"><em>[Kaye, supra, </em>176 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 490, 423 A.2d 1002.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b129-8\">We also noted in <em>Kaye </em>that when the State took samples of the defendant\u2019s blood, he was apprised of his right to have another sample drawn and tested by a physician of his own choosing but he did not exercise that opportunity. <em>Id. </em>at 492, 423 A.2d 1002.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-9\">The issue was not fully argued in either court below, and thus was not addressed by the Law Division judge. On remand, either party may offer evidence relevant to the issue: whether the State\u2019s failure to preserve and supply defendant with the unused portion of his blood sample deprived him of due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-10\">VI</p>\n<p id=\"b129-11\">We reject defendant\u2019s contention that he was deprived of his constitutional right to a speedy trial based on the nearly five months that elapsed between his arrest and the beginning of his trial. Defendant notes that he demanded a speedy trial on two occasions, and he claims that prior to his conviction, he was subjected to embarrassment and apprehension.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-12\">We apply the four-pronged test of <em>Barker v. Wingo, </em>407 <em>U.S. 514, </em>530-33, 92 <em>S.Ct. </em>2182, 2192-93, 33 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>101, 115-19 (1972), to a speedy trial claim. <em>See State v. Gaikwad, </em>349 <em>N.J.Super. </em>62, 88, 793 A.2d 39 (2002). In <em>Barker, </em>the U.S. Supreme Court identified four factors to determine whether a defendant was deprived of the right to a speedy trial: \u201clength of delay, the reason for the delay, the defendant\u2019s assertion of the right, and prejudice to the defendant.\u201d <em>Barker, supra, </em>407 <em>U.S. </em>at 530, 92 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2192, 33 L.Ed.2d at 117.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-13\">Defendant has not established a claim under <em>Barker. </em>Under the circumstances presented, we find insufficient merit in defendant\u2019s speedy trial claim to warrant further discussion in this opinion. <em>See R. </em>2:ll-3(e)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b130-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>VII</p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">Defendant\u2019s conviction is reversed and all charges are remanded to the Municipal Court of Manville. If the State seeks to rely upon the lab certificate in a new trial, the State must produce a witness to testify on personal knowledge of the testing and the preparation of the lab certificate. The State must also produce evidence of the chain of custody sufficient to allow the trier of fact to conclude that the sample tested was in fact defendant\u2019s uneontaminated blood. Finally, either party may address the issue of the State\u2019s failure to supply defendant with the unused portion of his blood sample.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-6\">Reversed and remanded for such further proceedings as are consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b116-9\"> In addition, defendant was ordered to pay a $350 fine, a $200 DUI surcharge, a $50 VCCB assessment, a $75 safe and secure communities assessment, and $36 in court costs.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b117-9\"> Detective Guilbert's name is incorrectly spelled \"Gilbert\u201d in IT.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b117-10\"> The statute has since been amended to provide that a blood alcohol level of 0.08 percent is a per se offense. <em>L. </em>2004, <em>c. </em>8, amending <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:4-50a(1)(i) and (ii).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b120-10\"> A DWI charge is a quasi-criminal offense entitling the defendant to the protection of the confrontation clauses. <em>See State v.
