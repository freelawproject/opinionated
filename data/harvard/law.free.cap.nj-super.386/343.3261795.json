Suit was filed by Linda Argent on behalf of herself and her son against the Bradys. The Bradys sought a defense and indemnification from their homeowner\u2019s carrier, New Jersey Manufacturers Insurance Company (NJM). When NJM denied coverage on the basis of the policy\u2019s business pursuits exclusion, the Bradys instituted a third-party declaratory judgment action against their carrier. On motion for summary judgment, the motion judge found an issue of fact to exist as to whether Linda Brady was engaged in the business of providing day care services, since there was a dispute as to whether she was being paid for such services or just reimbursed for her expenses when she accepted Argent\u2019s weekly payment on behalf of Vincent.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b377-7\">Because discovery disclosed that the dog may have been owned by the Bradys\u2019 son Michael, who lived with them, an amended complaint was filed by Argent in her dog bite case naming him as a defendant. When Michael proffered his defense to NJM, it denied coverage to him, as well, as the result of the business pursuits exclusion, despite the fact that Michael was not personally engaged in any business allegedly conducted by his mother. Michael has also filed a claim against NJM in this litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-8\">In answers to the amended complaint, both the parents and Michael denied ownership of the dog. Thereafter, a summary judgment motion was filed by Michael\u2019s parents seeking dismissal of the claims against them on the basis of their lack of ownership of the dog that had injured Vincent. Summary judgment was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>denied \u201cfor reasons set forth on the record\u201d by order dated April 4, 2005. A transcript of those reasons has not been provided.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">Following consideration of a motion by Michael seeking a judgment against NJM for defense and indemnification pursuant to the terms of NJM\u2019s coverage, the court entered an order in Michael\u2019s favor, finding in a written opinion that Michael was an insured, and that the severability clause of NJM\u2019s policy operated to remove him from the purview of the business pursuits exclusion by creating an ambiguity as to the applicability of the exclusion. NJM moved for leave to file an interlocutory appeal, claiming that a final resolution of the coverage issue operated as an impediment to settlement of the action. We granted its motion. We now reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-7\">The contested exclusion from liability coverage provided:</p>\n<p id=\"b378-8\"><em>Section II </em>\u2014 Exclusions</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-9\">1.

Severability of Insurance This insurance applies separately to each insured. This condition will not increase our limit of liability for any one occurrence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b379-9\">We note that the business pursuits provision excludes coverage for injury arising out of or in connection with a business engaged in by \u201can\u201d insured, not \u201cthe\u201d insured. However, \u201can\u201d insured is utilized, rather than \u201cany\u201d insured. Moreover, whereas the policy\u2019s intentional conduct exclusion specifically provides for the inapplicability of the policy\u2019s severability clause to the exclusion, the business pursuits exclusion does not make specific reference to the severability clause, nor do the following eight exclusions. Whether either NJM\u2019s failure to use \u201cany\u201d rather than \u201can\u201d or its failure to specifically reference the severability clause in connection with the business pursuits exclusion results in a finding of coverage are the specific issues presented in this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-10\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-11\">We address first the issue of whether there is coverage as the result of NJM\u2019s use of the phrase \u201can\u201d insured. It is doubtlessly true that if NJM had used the phrase \u201cthe\u201d insured, coverage for Michael Brady would exist, regardless of the business pursuits exclusion, because there is no evidence that the injury arose out of a business engaged in by him. Care of the infant Vincent was provided by Linda Brady, and no other insured.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b380-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>We find that the insurer\u2019s use of the phrase \u201can\u201d insured can be reasonably understood only as encompassing a business engaged in either by Linda, her husband Joseph or her son Michael, the three persons to whom homeowner\u2019s protection was, in general terms, offered under the policy at issue. Courts have uniformly held that the use of the article \u201can\u201d in this context is not susceptible to any other meaning, and in this context cannot be deemed synonymous with \u201cthe.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">In reaching this conclusion, we are mindful that our task in construing a contract of insurance \u201cis to search broadly for the probable intent of the parties in an effort to find a reasonable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>meaning in keeping with the express general purposes of the policy.\u201d <em>Sinopoli v. No. River Ins. Co., </em>244 <em>N.J.Super. </em>245, 250, 581 A.2d 1368 (App.Div.1990), <em>certif. denied, </em>127 <em>N.J. </em>325, 604 A.2d 600 (1991). Where the policy is clear and unambiguous, we are bound to enforce it. <em>Longobardi v. Chubb Ins. Co., </em>121 <em>N.J. </em>530, 537, 582 A.2d 1257 (1990); <em>Boswell v. Travelers Indem. Co., </em>38 <em>N.J.Super. </em>599, 604, 120 A.2d 250 (App.Div.1956). Only where the language is ambiguous does the doctrine of reasonable expectations come into play, permitting a construction that favors such expectations of an insured. <em>Kievit v. Loyal Protective Life Ins. Co., </em>34 <em>N.J. </em>475, 482, 170 A.2d 22 (1961). This principle has particular force when the meaning of an exclusionary clause is at issue, and when an ambiguity arises in this context, the clause must be strictly construed against the insurer so that reasonably anticipated coverage is provided. <em>Weedo v. Stone-E-Brick, Inc., </em>155 <em>N.J.Super. </em>474, 485, 382 A.2d 1152 (App.Div.1977), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>81 <em>N.J. </em>233, 405 A.2d 788 (1979); <em>see also Butler v. Bonner &amp; Barnewall, Inc., </em>56 <em>N.J. </em>567, 576, 267 A.2d 527 (1970); <em>Mazzilli v. Acc. &amp; Cas. Ins. Co. of Winterthur, </em>35 <em>N.J. </em>1, 8, 170 A.2d 800 (1961).</p>\n<p id=\"b381-6\">However, in this case, no ambiguity is created by the use of the phrase \u201can insured,\u201d and we therefore construe it, as it was doubtlessly intended, to exclude from coverage any liability resulting from the business pursuits of a covered person, regardless of whether the person sued was engaged in those business pursuits. Although stated in <em>dictum, </em>the Supreme Court appears to share our view of the distinction between \u201cthe\u201d and \u201can\u201d insured. <em>See Maryland Cas. Co. v. N.J. Mfrs. Cas. Ins. Co., 28 N.J. </em>17, 19, 145 A.2d 15 (1958) (noting in construing an exclusion for bodily injury of any employee of the insured while engaged in the employment of the insured that defendant would construe the phrase \u201cthe insured\u201d to mean \u201cany insured,\u201d which would defeat the purpose of the provision to exclude workers\u2019 compensation risks); <em>see also Erdo v. Torcon Constr. Co., </em>275 <em>N.J.Super. </em>117, 120-23, 645 A.2d 806 (App.Div.1994).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b382-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>Further, we do not find that the policy\u2019s exclusion is rendered ambiguous by the use of the phrase \u201can\u201d insured, rather than the phrase \u201cany\u201d insured, finding the two words to operate synonymously. Our view is shared, for instance, by the New Hampshire Supreme Court, which held in <em>Allstate Ins. Co. v. Stamp, </em>134 <em>N.H. </em>59, 588 A.2d 363, 365 (1991): \u2018We find that Allstate\u2019s use of the indefinite article \u2018an,\u2019 rather than the definite \u2018the,\u2019 before \u2018insured\u2019 is a clear reference to <em>any </em>insured who commits an intentional act resulting in damages, regardless of whether or not he is the particular insured seeking coverage.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\">That the use of the word \u201cany\u201d could be perceived by some as making the exclusion clearer, does not make the language that was chosen ambiguous. Language in a policy of insurance is genuinely ambiguous only if the \u201cphrasing of the policy is so confusing that the average policyholder cannot make out the boundaries of coverage.\u201d <em>Weedo, supra, </em>81 <em>N.J. </em>at 247, 405 A.2d 788.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>III.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-6\">We address second the issue of whether the policy\u2019s sever-ability clause or the absence of a disclaimer of the applicability of that clause rendered the Bradys\u2019 homeowner\u2019s coverage ambiguous. Although the issue has not been addressed in New Jersey, the courts in other jurisdictions are split on the effect of a severability clause on a policy exclusion that applies to the acts of \u201can\u201d or \u201cany\u201d insured.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-7\">The majority of courts hold, primarily in connection with a construction of the exclusion of coverage for intentional conduct found in many homeowner\u2019s policies, that the existence of a severability clause does not affect a clearly worded exclusion such as that existing in the present case.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b383-8\">In particular, we note the court\u2019s decision in <em>American Family Mut. Ins. Co. v. Moore, </em>912 S.W.2d 531, 534-35 (Mo.App.1995), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>which construes facts and policy provisions<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> that are substantially similar to those present in the case before us to bar coverage to the son of the operator of a home day care business for injuries sustained by a child receiving day care from a bite by the son\u2019s dog. As stated there:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b384-5\">Because an insurance contract is an agreement between parties that should be interpreted in a manner consistent with the expressions therein, the policy before us unambiguously expresses an intention to deny coverage to all insureds when damage is the result of a business pursuit. The purpose of the severability clause is not to negate the plainly worded meaning of the business exclusion clause. <em>Id. </em>at 534-35.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b384-6\">However, a minority of courts hold to the contrary.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b384-7\">In our view, the former line of cases giving effect to policy exclusionary language as clear and unambiguous is more persuasive. We reach this conclusion for the following reasons: First, if a severability clause is given effect, despite an exclusion of coverage for specifically described conduct by \u201can insured,\u201d as in <em>Worcester Mut. Ins. Co. v. Marnell, </em>398 <em>Mass. </em>240, 496 N.E.2d 158 (1986), a leading case adopting the minority position, then the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>language of the exclusion as it relates to \u201can insured\u201d or \u201cany insured\u201d is robbed of any meaning. <em>See Chacon v. Am. Family Mut. Ins. Co., </em>788 P.2d 748, 752 (Colo.1990) (finding decisions denying coverage despite existence of severability clause more persuasive because each decision \u201cconsiders and gives effect to all the policy provisions and recognizes that an insurance policy is a contract between the parties which should be enforced in a manner consistent with the intentions expressed therein\u201d); <em>Johnson v. Allstate Ins. Co., </em>687 A.2d 642, 645 (Me.1997) (declining to follow <em>Worcester </em>because the Court in that decision admittedly construed the policy at issue so as to make the word \u201cany\u201d meaningless).</p>\n<p id=\"b385-6\">Second, we disagree with the <em>Worcester </em>Court that a severability clause is rendered meaningless if it does not act to provide coverage to insureds that would otherwise be precluded by exclusions applicable because of the conduct of \u201can\u201d or \u201cany\u201d insured. We find that the Court in <em>Worcester </em>has misconstrued the purpose of a severability clause, which is designed solely to render the coverage actually provided by the insuring provisions of the policy applicable to all insureds equally, up to coverage limits. The severability clause is not denominated a \u201ccoverage provision,\u201d and it would be unreasonable to find that it operated independently in that capacity to increase the insurance afforded under the insuring provisions of the policy, or to partially nullify existing coverage exclusions. \u201c[T]he purpose of severability clauses is to spread protection, to the limits of coverage, among all of the ... insureds. The purpose is not to negate bargained-for exclusions which are plainly worded.\u201d <em>Northwest G.F. Mut. Ins. Co. v. Norgard, </em>518 N.W.2d 179, 183 (N.D.1994)(quoting <em>Nat\u2019l Ins. Underwriters v. Lexington Flying Club, Inc. </em>603 S.W.2d 490, 492 (Ky.Ct.App.1979)); <em>American Family v. Moore, supra, </em>912 S.W.2d at 534-35.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-7\">Third, we find it appropriate in determining the scope of the business pursuits exclusion contained in NJM\u2019s homeowner\u2019s poli<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>ey and the existence of any genuine ambiguity as the result of the presence of a severability clause to look at how the policy interacts with other available forms of insurance. <em>Carbone v. Gen Accid. Ins. Co., </em>937 <em>F.Supp. </em>413, 420 (E.D.Pa.1996). Business risk insurance clearly was available to Linda Brady upon the commencement of her day care business, albeit at a premium in addition to that paid for homeowner\u2019s insurance. The decision in <em>Northwest v. Norgard, supra, </em>demonstrates this point when it recites that Jean Norgard, who operated a home day care business, obtained coverage for Jean\u2019s day care, at an additional premium, pursuant to the terms of a Home Day Care Coverage Endorsement to her homeowner\u2019s policy. 518 N.W.2d at 180. Such coverage was not obtained by Linda Brady. Rather, she had a policy that excluded business risks from its purview.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">When viewed in that light, we find it illogical to conclude that an insured would reasonably anticipate coverage for business pursuits pursuant to the terms of a homeowner\u2019s policy excluding coverage for such activities, simply because the danger was created by a family member other than the business person. Coverage for a business risk cannot reasonably be found to arise in the absence of the extra premium payment undoubtedly required for such an enhanced risk. <em>See Am. Family v. Moore, supra, </em>912 S.W.2d at 533-35 (\u201cBecause an insurance contract is an agreement between parties that should be interpreted in a manner consistent with the expressions therein, the policy before us unambiguously expresses an intention to deny coverage to all insureds when damage is the result of a business pursuit. The purpose of the severability clause is not to negate the plainly worded meaning of the business exclusion clause.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b386-6\">Moreover, those business pursuits conducted in the home such as day care are foreseeably subject to risks created by family members other than the business proprietor, such as the risk of injury from a pet owned by another family member, as here. In this circumstance, it would be unreasonable to utilize a purported <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>policy ambiguity as a means of establishing coverage, since no coverage could reasonably have been anticipated to exist in the first instance. To employ the doctrine of ambiguity to create coverage here would thus be contrary to the reasonable expectations doctrine, and would stand that doctrine on its head. Alleged ambiguities cannot be construed in favor of an insured if the only result is to create unexpected coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-6\">As a final matter, we note that a preponderance of the cases finding coverage as the result of severability clauses arise from claims by innocent parties or ones against whom claims are tangential. <em>See Northwestern Nat\u2019l Ins. Co. v. Nemetz, </em>135 Wis.2d 245, 400 N.W.2d 33 (App.1986) providing coverage to an innocent co-owner of property destroyed by a co-insured arsonist, <em>Premier Ins. Co. v. Adams, </em>632 So.2d 1054 (Fla.App. 5th Dist. 1994), <em>Catholic Diocese v. Raymer, </em>251 <em>Kan. </em>689, 840 P.2d 456 (1992), <em>Worcester v. Marnell, supra, </em>affording coverage to an innocent parent, and <em>Litz v. State Farm Fire &amp; Cas. Co., </em>346 <em>Md. </em>217, 695 A.2d 566 (1997), affording a defense to an innocent spouse.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Unlike the insureds in those cases, Michael Brady is not an innocent co-insured who will be unfairly burdened by liability in this case. If he is found to be the owner of the dog, as discovery suggests, he is subject to strict liability as the consequence of the dog\u2019s aggressive conduct pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>4:19-16. Further, were it not for his mother\u2019s business pursuits, Vincent Argent would not have been on the Bradys\u2019 property and thus subject to the dog\u2019s attack.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-7\">In sum, we see no principled reason to afford coverage in light of the business pursuits exclusion contained in NJM\u2019s policy, determining that the existence of a severability clause does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>operate to create an ambiguity that would require a construction of the policy so as to negate the business pursuits exclusion and afford coverage to Michael Brady.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">As a final matter, we address whether the absence of a direct reference to the inapplicability of the severability clause within the business pursuits exception renders that exception ambiguous. We infer that the specific disclaimer of severability, appearing in connection with the intentional conduct exception, was placed there because of the extensive amount of litigation regarding the interpretation of that and similar provisions and the existence of a legal issue whether an exclusion based upon an enhanced degree of culpability should be applied to those whose conduct rises to no more than negligence. In this context, insurers and policyholders alike could benefit from the additional clarification. Differing degrees of culpability are infrequently encountered in the context of the business pursuits exception, and the clarification is thus not essential. Although it might have been preferable if the disclaimer of severability had followed all of the exclusions, we do not find its absence to create an ambiguity that we have found is otherwise lacking in the policy\u2019s terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-6\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b377-9\"> The record does not reflect a resolution of that dispute. Nonetheless the parties have presented their positions on coverage to us as though the issue of whether a business was being conducted on the Bradys' premises had been decided adversely to Linda Brady. We will assume such to be the case in our coverage analysis.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b378-16\"> Ownership of the dog remains a contested issue. Although we were informed at oral argument that Michael had paid for the dog, which was jointly owned by him and his girlfriend. If the dog is not Michael\u2019s, there is no basis for liability or consequent indemnification, regardless of our determination of the legal principles governing the coverage issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b379-12\"> <em>See, e.g., Western Cas. &amp; Sur.
