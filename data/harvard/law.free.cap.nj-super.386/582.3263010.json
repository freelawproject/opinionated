We are asked to decide two issues in this appeal: (1) whether the CCCC is a \u201cplace of public accommodation\u201d for purposes of determining whether the Camden <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>defendants discriminated against plaintiff in the furnishing thereof, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>10:5-1f(1); and (2) whether there was an employer-employee relationship between plaintiff and the Camden defendants for purposes of determining whether employment discrimination occurred, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>10:5-12(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b618-5\">In our review of the record, we view the evidence, as we must, in a light most favorable to plaintiff. <em>Brill v. Guardian Life Ins. Co. of Am., </em>142 <em>N.J. </em>520, 540, 666 A.2d 146 (1995). In March 2000, the Town of Hammonton hired plaintiff as a radio dispatcher for its police department. She commenced employment on April 2, 2000, and was terminated on June 29, 2000. Shortly after she began working, Hammonton required plaintiff to obtain a 9-1-1 certification. <em>N.J.A.C. </em>17:24-2.2(c). Consequently, plaintiff enrolled in the Association of Public-Safety Communications Officials International (APCO) basic teleeommunicator training program run by Camden County and taught by Howard at the CCCC. She attended class on June 5, 6 and 7, 2000, and appeared for approximately five minutes on June 8, 2000. During the course of instruction, plaintiff claims Howard sexually harassed her by subjecting her to \u201cvarious lewd and derogatory remarks of a sexual nature\u201d, and to a tape recording of supposed emergency calls consisting of obscene material. When plaintiff complained of Howard\u2019s conduct to her superior officers at the Hammonton Police Department, she was advised that she did not have to return to the class. Instead, the police chief made alternate arrangements for plaintiff to take the dispatcher certification test, which she passed. On June 9, 2000, plaintiff received a certificate of completion of the requirements of the APCO basic telecommunicator training program. Plaintiff, however, did not report to work after June 14, 2000, claiming to be sick. As a result, Hammonton terminated her employment on June 29,2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-6\">Plaintiff, thereafter, filed a complaint in federal court against Hammonton, its governing body and clerk, and the Camden defendants, alleging violations of the Due Process Clause, the First Amendment, the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconcilia<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>tion Act, the New Jersey LAD, and the New Jersey Conscientious Employee Protection Act. The district court granted summary judgment in favor of all defendants, but the appeals court reversed as to the LAD claims. <em>Thomas v. Town of Hammonton, </em>351 F.3d 108, 119 (3d Cir.2003). On remand, the district court dismissed plaintiffs complaint pursuant to 28 <em>U.S.C. </em>\u00a7 1367(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b619-6\">This sexual harassment action in the Law Division followed dismissal of plaintiffs federal lawsuit. On the Camden defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment, plaintiff posited two functionally distinct theories of liability under the LAD: employment discrimination and discrimination in relation to public accommodation. In granting the Camden defendants summary judgment dismissing plaintiffs complaint,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the motion judge rejected both theories, finding that the CCCC was not a place of public accommodation and that no employment relationship existed between plaintiff and the Camden defendants for purposes of coming within the purview of the LAD\u2019s discrimination ban. Plaintiff appeals. We affirm as to the latter determination, but reverse as to the former because we conclude that the Camden defendants qualify as a \u201cplace of public accommodation\u201d to support an LAD claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-7\">(i)</p>\n<p id=\"b619-8\">Without question, sexual harassment is \u201ca form of targeted discrimination.\u201d <em>Pukowsky v. Caruso, </em>312 <em>N.J.Super. </em>171, 177, 711 A.2d 398 (App.Div.1998). Equally without doubt, the LAD proscribes sexual harassment both in the workplace, <em>Lehmann v. Toys \u2018R\u2019 Us, Inc., </em>132 <em>N.J. </em>587, 600-01, 626 A.2d 445 (1993), and in places <em>of </em>public accommodation, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>10:5-4. Thus,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-9\">All persons shall have the opportunity to obtain employment, and to obtain all the accommodations, advantages, facilities, and privileges of any place of public accommodation ... without discrimination because of ... sex ... subject only to conditions and limitations applicable alike to all persons. This opportunity is recognized as and declared to be a civil right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-10\"><em>[N.J.S.A. </em>10:5-4.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b620-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>Further, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>10:5-12 provides that \u201c[i]t shall be ... unlawful discrimination\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b620-4\">For any ... agent, or employee of any place of public accommodation directly or indirectly to refuse, withhold from or deny to any person any of the accommodations, advantages, facilities or privileges thereof, or to discriminate against any person in the furnishing thereof ... on account of the [person\u2019s] ... sex____ <em>[N.J.S.A. </em>10:5-12f(1).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b620-7\">Significantly, \u201c[t]he prohibition of discrimination in relation to public accommodation is functionally distinct from the ban on employment discrimination.\u201d <em>Peper v. Princeton Univ. Bd. of Trs., </em>77 <em>N.J. </em>55, 67, 389 A.2d 465 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b620-8\"><em>N.J.S.A. </em>10:5-5l provides a non-exhaustive list of places of \u201cpublic accommodations.\u201d In other words, places of public accommodation are not limited to those set forth in the statute. Our \u201cstatutory definition of \u2018[a] place of public accommodation\u2019 is extremely broad\u201d, and \u201c[t]he term is said to \u2018include, but not be limited to,\u2019 a list of over 50 types of places.\u201d <em>Boy Scouts of Am. v. Dale (Dale </em>I), 530 <em>U.S. </em>640, 656-57, 120 <em>S.Ct. </em>2446, 2455, 147 L.Ed.2d 554, 568 (2000) (quoting <em>N.J.S.A. </em>10:5-5(l) (first alteration in original)); <em>Zahorian v. Russell Fitt Real Estate Agency, </em>62 <em>N.J. </em>399, 412, 301 A.2d 754 (1973); <em>Fraser v. Robin Dee Day Camp, </em>44 <em>N.J. </em>480, 486, 210 A.2d 208 (1965). \u201cMany on the list are what one would expect to be places where the public is invited.\u201d <em>Dale I, supra, </em>530 <em>U.S. </em>at 657, 120 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2455, 147 L.Ed.2d at 568. \u201cBut the statute also includes places that often may not carry with them open invitations to the public____\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>This is so \u201cbecause the goal of the NJLAD is to eradicate the \u2018cancer of discrimination,\u2019 the statute must be broadly interpreted to further its purposes.\u201d <em>Ellison v. Creative Learning Ctr., </em>383 <em>N.J.Super. </em>581, 588, 893 A.2d 12 (App.Div.2006) (quoting <em>Dale v. Boy Scouts of Am. (Dale II), </em>160 <em>N.J. </em>562, 584-85, 734 A.2d 1196 (1999), <em>rev\u2019d and remanded on other gr., </em>530 <em>U.S. </em>640, 120 <em>S.Ct. </em>2446, 147 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>554 (2000)).</p>\n<p id=\"b620-11\">Generally, in the context of private entities, from commercial to membership organizations providing services to the public, we have developed standards to help determine whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>the entity qualifies as a public accommodation. In this regard, our \u201cfocus appropriately rests on whether the entity \u2018engages in broad public solicitation, whether it maintains close relationships with the government or other public accommodations, or whether it is similar to enumerated or other previously recognized public accommodations.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 588-89, 893 A.2d 12 (quoting <em>Dale II, supra, </em>160 <em>N.J. </em>at 588, 734 A.2d 1196); <em>Ptaszynski v.

For non-public entities, \u201c[t]he existence of broad public solicitation has \u2018consistently been a principal characteristic of public accommodations.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ellison, supra, </em>383 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 589, 893 A.2d 12 (quoting <em>Dale II, supra, </em>160 <em>N.J. </em>at 588, 734 A.2d 1196). <em>Compare Frank v.

Matawan Reg\u2019l Bd. of Educ., </em>77 <em>N.J. </em>514, 523, 391 A.2d 899 (1978) (\u201cPublic schools and public education\u201d as places of public accommodation, \u201cassuredly are covered by the anti-discrimination law.\u201d). <em>But see Doe v. Div. of Youth &amp; Family Servs., </em>148 <em>F.Supp.2d </em>462, 496 (D.N.J.2001) (state agency DYFS was not place of public accommodation because not included on the list of public accommodations and it does not engage in broad public solicitation).</p>\n<p id=\"b622-4\">Undisputably, the County of Camden is a creature of state government, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:44-126, and the CCCC is a division of the Department of Public Safety, an executive unit of county government. As the uncontradicted proof demonstrates, the CCCC is a dispatch agency for police, fire and emergency medical services. It handles fire and ambulance dispatching and a majority of police dispatching for Camden County municipalities and all 9-1-1 services. It is a \u201cpublic safety answering point.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>52:17C-7. It also functions as the training center for county personnel employed at the CCCC and for police departments that do not have a facility to teach the APCO program.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-5\">A unit of county government performing an executive function of county government, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:44-126, the CCCC is not a \u201cprivate entity that needs to be shoe-horned into a list of other, primarily private, entities that provide services to the public.\u201d <em>Ptaszynski, supra, </em>371 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 347, 853 A.2d 288. As we noted in that case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-6\">It would indeed lead to an anomalous result if private organizations with close ties to government agencies were places of public accommodation because of those ties, while the government agency itself was not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-9\">\n<em>mm</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b622-10\">Despite their obvious public character, defendants nevertheless argue they are not a place of public accommodation because public access to the CCCC building, which is \u201clocked down 24 hours per day, 7 days per week,\u201d is limited and tightly controlled. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>granting them summary judgment, the motion judge agreed, concluding:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-6\">And the bottom line is this. I find that the Camden County Communications Center is not an area of public accommodation. It is a governmental agency, but in my judgment, that\u2019s not dispositive of the issue. And ... it is a secured facility by invitation only, with a special mission, so to speak, that does not provide general services to the public back and forth. It provides obviously a public service. It\u2019s the Communications Center. But so does the governor\u2019s office; he provides a public service. Runs the State from the executive standpoint. And it seems to me that if the governor\u2019s office \u2014 and when I say the governor\u2019s office, I\u2019m not talking about the hallway outside the governor\u2019s office \u2014 I\u2019m talking about the governor\u2019s office, a place where he opens up the door. He sees his office, he sees his desk, the seat, that that is not, that specific area is not an area of public accommodation, then even though the Camden County Communications Center <em>is </em>perhaps not as strong in terms of the argument, it is more akin to the governor\u2019s inner office, so to speak, that is, the police department or restaurant, bathroom, that type of thing. And since I don\u2019t believe that the LAD controls the liability of Camden County as to what occurred at the dispatcher department,</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b623-7\">This reasoning, however, overlooks the plain fact that \u201c \u2018places do not discriminate; people who own and operate places do.\u2019\u201d <em>Dale v. Boy Scouts of Am. (Dale III), </em>308 <em>N.J.Super. </em>516, 533, 706 A.2d 270 (App.Div.1998) (quoting <em>Welsh v. Boy Scouts of Am., </em>993 <em>F.2d </em>1267, 1282 (7th Cir.) (Cummings, J., dissenting), <em>cert. denied, </em>510 <em>U.S. </em>1012, 114 <em>S.Ct. </em>602, 126 L.Ed.2d 567 (1993)), <em>aff'd, </em>160 <em>N.J. </em>562, 734 A.2d 1196 (1999), <em>rev\u2019d &amp; remanded on other grounds, </em>530 <em>U.S. </em>640, 120 <em>S.Ct. </em>2446, 147 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>554 (2000). If the County of Camden and its executive units are not subject to the LAD, its employees would be free to discriminate, a prospect we simply could not tolerate. As we noted in a closely analogous context, \u201c[t]o countenance discrimination by a police force, while seeking to eradicate discrimination, for instance, in private organizations, public libraries and universities, would be both inconsistent with and contrary to the goals of the LAD.\u201d <em>Ptaszynski, supra, </em>371 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 348, 853 A.2d 288. Clearly, then, \u201cany State governmental agency is a place of public accommodation for purposes of inclusion under the umbrella of the LAD____\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>As the Court noted in <em>Dale II, </em>\u201cNew Jersey governmental entities are, of course, bound by the LAD.\u201d <em>Dale II, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number><em>supra, </em>160 <em>N.J. </em>at 593 n. 7, 734 A.2d 1196. It was error, therefore, for the motion judge to have dismissed plaintiffs LAD claim on the grounds that the CCCC was not a place of public accommodation.</p>\n<p id=\"Adq\">(ii)</p>\n<p id=\"b624-5\">On the other hand, we are satisfied that the judge\u2019s dismissal of that part of plaintiffs cause of action alleging a claim of employment discrimination was proper. This is because there was no legally recognizable employment relationship between plaintiff and defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-6\">Clearly, \u201cthe LAD was intended to prohibit discrimination in the context of an employer/employee relationship____\u201d <em>Pukowsky, supra, </em>312 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 184, 711 A.2d 398; <em>see also Delgado v. McTighe, </em>442 <em>F.Supp. </em>725, 729 (E.D.Pa.1977) (\u201c[T]he courts have determined that there must be either an employer-employee relationship between the parties or a prospective one\u201d.). Correspondingly, the lack of an employment relationship between the plaintiff and the defendant will preclude liability. <em>Cf. Ass\u2019n of Mexican-American Educators v. California, </em>231 F.3d 572, 582 (9th Cir.2000); <em>United States v. Bd. of Educ. for Sch. Dist., </em>911 <em>F.2d </em>882, 891 (3d Cir.1990); <em>Tyrrell v.

Prudential Ins. Co. of Am., </em>383 <em>N.J.Super. </em>270, 277, 891 A.2d 673 (App.Div.2006), <em>certif. granted, </em>186 <em>N.J. </em>608, 897 A.2d 1062 (2006). In defining \u201cEmployee\u201d, the LAD states only that the term \u201cdoes not include any individual employed in the domestic service of any person.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>10:5-5f. The term \u201cEmployer\u201d is similarly inclusive, encompassing any person, \u201cunless otherwise specifically exempt under another section of this act, and includes the State, any political or civil subdivision thereof, and all public officers, agencies, boards or bodies.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>10:5-5e. A \u201c[p]erson\u201d is \u201cone or more individuals, partnerships, associations, organizations, labor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>organizations, corporations, legal representatives, trustees, trustees in bankruptcy, receivers, and fiduciaries.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>10:5-5a.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-6\">Because of the breadth of the statutory language, courts in New Jersey have developed \u201ca twelve-factor test in the context of a LAD claim to determine whether an employment relationship exists between the parties.\u201d <em>Kounelis v.

Dist. of Philadelphia, </em>911 F.2d 882, 891 (3d Cir.1990). \u201cFor claims of hostile work environment brought under Title VII [of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 2000e to 2000-17], the Third Circuit applies a \u2018control test\u2019 to determine whether an entity is an \u2018employer\u2019.\u201d <em>Russo v. Ryerson, </em>No. 01-CV-4458, 2006 <em>WL </em>477006, at *4, 2006 <em>U.S. Dist. Lexis </em>10447, at *15 (D.N.J. Feb. 28, 2006) (citing <em>Graves, supra, </em>117 F.3d at 723.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>) Other circuits have followed suit. <em>Ass\u2019n of Mexican-American Educators, supra, </em>231 F.3d at 582-83; <em>Mangram v. General Motors, </em>108 F.3d 61, 62-63 (4th Cir.1997); <em>E.E.O.C. v. Illinois, </em>69 F.3d 167, 169 (7th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b626-4\">The control test as it relates to a <em>de facto </em>employer \u201cis appropriately used where it is clear that a putative defendant does not directly employ the plaintiff, but nevertheless controls the plaintiffs employment to the point that it would contravene the intent of Title VII for the putative defendant to avoid liability for its own discriminatory actions.\u201d <em>Kerr v. WGN Cont\u2019l Broad. Co., </em>229 F.Supp.2d 880, 886 (N.D.Ill.2002); <em>see e.g., Conroy v. City of Phila., </em>421 <em>F.Supp.2d </em>879 (E.D.Pa.2006) (explaining how \u201cCity\u2019s ability to place its own requirements upon the hiring process,\u201d as well as \u201cits control over the rate of hiring, and its authority vis a vis firings,\u201d indicates that the State did not have an indirect or <em>de facto </em>employment relationship with plaintiff and the claims should be dismissed); <em>Tyrrell, supra, </em>134 F.Supp.2d at 380 (explaining how firefighter plaintiff was hired by city, required to complete <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>training at academy, failed to satisfy physical training requirements, was terminated, and could not bring age discrimination claim against academy because it did not have such control over plaintiffs work life to be considered <em>defacto </em>employer).</p>\n<p id=\"b627-6\">Indirect liability results when the defendant employer \u201cso far controls] the plaintiffs employment relationship that it [is] appropriate to regard the defendant as the de facto or indirect employer of the plaintiff____\u201d <em>E.E.O.C., supra, </em>69 F.3d at 169. In other words, \u201c[d]e facto or indirect employer liability depends on the amount of the control a putative Title VII defendant exerts over the plaintiffs employment.\u201d <em>Kerr, supra, </em>229 F.Supp.2d at 886. It \u201caddresses the situation where a formal employment relationship may be absent, but the putative defendant is so extensively involved with the plaintiffs day to day employment that the putative defendant is the \u2018real\u2019 employer for all intents and purposes, including Title VII liability.\u201d Ibid.; <em>see E.E.O.C., supra, </em>69 <em>F.3d </em>at 171 (explaining how entities that \u201cpull[] the strings in the background\u201d, and retain employment decision making power, are de facto employers pursuant to Title VII).</p>\n<p id=\"b627-9\">The circumstances in the <em>Tyrrell </em>case bear striking similarity to those here. Tyrrell, a newly hired firefighter, was required to complete training at a community college fire academy pursuant to a collective bargaining agreement struck between the firefighters\u2019 union and the city. <em>Tyrrell, supra, </em>134 F.Supp.2d at 375. He could not complete the training on his first attempt due to injury, and when given another opportunity, he was unable to satisfy the physical training requirements imposed by the academy. <em>Id. </em>at 376. Subsequently terminated, Tyrrell filed an age discrimination action against the city, the firefighters\u2019 union, and the community college that provided the physical training program, alleging that defendants sought to exclude otherwise qualified older persons from city firefighter positions by subjecting them to rigorous physical requirements that were not bona fide occupational qualifications. <em>Id. </em>at 375. The court, adopting the <em>de facto </em>test, held that Tyrrell did not advance a successful Title VII claim against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>the academy because, as a community college, it did \u201cnot have such control over the plaintiff student\u2019s work life that it could be considered his <em>defacto </em>employer.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 380.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-4\">Despite the soundness of the <em>defacto </em>test, plaintiff nevertheless advances a more expansive \u201caiding and abetting\u201d theory of liability espoused in <em>Sibley Mem\u2019l Hosp. v. Wilson, </em>488 F.2d 1338 (D.C.Cir.1973), to encompass any putative defendant who adversely affects a plaintiffs employment with a third party. <em>Id. </em>at 1340-42. In other words, plaintiff argues that under the LAD, liability exists, even in the absence of a direct employment relationship between the plaintiff and defendant, when a defendant interferes with or intrudes upon plaintiffs employment opportunities with a third party by unlawfully discriminating against the plaintiff. <em>See Morrison v. Amer. Bd. of Psychiatry and Neurology, Inc., </em>908 <em>F.Supp. </em>582 (N.D.Ill.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b628-5\">In <em>Sibley, </em>the court held that a male private duty nurse, who was paid directly by his patients, had a right of action for sex discrimination cognizable under Title VII although defendant hospital was not his \u201cemployer.\u201d <em>Sibley Mem\u2019l Hosp., supra, </em>488 F.2d at 1340-42. In so holding, the court found that the hospital, which operated a registry and referral program that supposedly refused to refer the plaintiff to female patients, had a sufficient nexus to the creation and continuance of the nurse\u2019s direct employment to bring the hospital under the reach of Title VII. <em>Id. </em>at 1342. The court reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-6\">Control over access to the job market may reside, depending upon the circumstances of the case, in a labor organization, an employment agency, or an employer as defined in Title VIT, and it would appear that Congress has determined to prohibit each of these from exerting any power it may have to foreclose, on indivious grounds, access by any individual to employment opportunities otherwise available to him. To permit a covered employer to exploit circumstances peculiarly affording it the capability of discriminatorily interfering with an individual\u2019s employment opportunities with another employer, while it could not do so with respect to employment in its own service, would be to condone continued use of the very criteria for employment that Congress has prohibited.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-7\"><em>[Id. </em>at 1341.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b629-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>We are persuaded that the LAD\u2019s reach, broad as it is, does not extend to those whose only nexus, employment-wise, is to adversely affect an aggrieved person\u2019s employment with a third party. Rather, we find the Third Circuit\u2019s <em>de facto </em>employer test the more reasonable measure of liability, compatible as it is with <em>Pukowsky\u2019s </em>emphasis on the degree of control the putative employer exercises over the worker.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-6\">Regardless of which test is applied, we are satisfied that based on the undisputed facts in this case, the relationship between plaintiff and the Camden defendants does not amount to employment for purposes of the LAD. Most significantly, the Camden defendants exerted none of the indicia of control over plaintiff traditionally associated with the employer-employee relationship. For instance, while plaintiff was enrolled in the training program, the Camden defendants did not compensate her, pay social security taxes for her, or provide health benefits to her. Nor did plaintiff accrue retirement or vacation benefits from the Camden defendants. Notably, the Camden defendants did not have the right to dictate the terms, conditions or privileges of her employment as a radio dispatcher with the Town of Hammonton. Moreover, for <em>Sibley </em>purposes, although the Town of Hammonton, plaintiffs actual employer, required her to obtain a 9-1-1 certification, she could have obtained the credential other than at the CCCC. Moreover, \u201c[a]ttendance at the training program was not mandatory\u201d and plaintiff was \u201cfree to leave the classroom as [she] pleased.\u201d Indeed, plaintiff received her certification despite her non-completion of classroom training. Thus, it cannot be said that the Camden defendants controlled whether or not plaintiff could obtain the APCO certification, much less interfered with her future third-party employment opportunities. And unlike <em>Sibley, </em>this is not a case where plaintiffs actual employer, the Township of Hammonton, entrusted a third party \u2014 the Camden defendants \u2014 with the responsibility to screen and supervise its employees, or control their work life. As such, plaintiff fails to satisfy even <em>Sibley\u2019s </em>more expansive view of employment to establish her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>sexual harassment employment discrimination claim under the LAD.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-4\">Accordingly, we affirm the portion of the order of the motion judge that dismissed plaintiffs LAD employment discrimination claim. We reverse, however, the remainder of the order that dismissed plaintiffs LAD claim on the grounds that the Camden defendants were not a place of accommodation, and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-5\">Affirmed in part; reversed and remanded in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b619-11\"> The Hammonton defendants eventually settled with plaintiff.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b626-5\"> Our state policy is to look to Title VII for guidance when interpreting provisions of the New Jersey LAD and to federal precedent governing Title VII \" 'as a key source of interpretative authority.\u2019 \" <em>Pukowsky, supra, </em>312 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 178, 711 A.2d 398 (quoting <em>Lehmann, supra, </em>132 <em>N.J. </em>at 600-01, 626 A.2d 445).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
