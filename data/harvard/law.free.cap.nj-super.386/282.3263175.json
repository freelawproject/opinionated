DMAHS found I.G. ineligible because she did not, upon her husband\u2019s death, elect the marital share of his estate, which, by will, passed his entire residuary estate to a testamentary trust that afforded the trustee sole discretion to expend funds for I.G.\u2019s needs. In her appeal, I.G. argues that waiver of the spousal elective share should not constitute a transfer of available resources rendering her ineligible for Medicaid. We disagree and affirm the DMAHS decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-8\">I.G. was born November 3, 1914, and was initially diagnosed with Alzheimer\u2019s disease in the late nineties. I.G. and her husband, E.G., continued to live together in their home until November 3, 2003, when I.G. moved to a nursing home. At some point before I.G. moved into the nursing home, title to the marital home was transferred to E.G. alone. On December 27, 2003, less than two months after I.G. had moved, E.G.\u2019s health deteriorated, and he also moved into the same nursing home.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-9\">I.G. and E.G. both applied for Medicaid benefits toward the end of 2003 and were both deemed eligible as of January 1, 2004. However, the marital home had to be sold. After the home was sold for $128,162.21 on May 7, 2004, E.G. was deemed resource ineligible, as the value of his assets exceeded the $2,000 Medicaid limit. His benefits were terminated as of May 31, 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-10\">About two months later, on July 26, 2004, E.G. died and his will was admitted to probate on August 6, 2004. J.K., the parties\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>niece, who held I.G.\u2019s power of attorney, was also E.G.\u2019s executrix under the will. E.G.\u2019s will left the entire residuary of his estate to I.G. \u201cwith the provision that said bequest shall be held In Trust [by J.K.] for [I.G.].\u201d E.G.\u2019s will named no subsequent beneficiary for any remainder of the trust upon I.G.\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-6\">In an August 11, 2004 letter, the Ocean County Board of Social Services warned J.K. that waiving I.G.\u2019s spousal elective share would \u201cresult in termination of Medicaid benefits.\u201d I.G.\u2019s attorney, also acting as J.K.\u2019s counsel, countered by advising the agency that E.G.\u2019s estate \u201cshould have no effect\u201d on I.G.\u2019s Medicaid eligibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-7\">On January 25, 2005, the residuary of E.G.\u2019s estate, $132,971.62, was deposited into a testamentary trust account at a New York bank. The will granted J.K. \u201csole discretion\u201d over the trust to \u201cpay over the principal and income, or any part thereof, for the needs of [I.G.] as [the trustee] shall determine.\u201d On February 15, 2005, Social Services notified I.G. that because her resources exceeded the Medicaid standard her benefits were terminated as of February 28, 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-8\">I.G. requested a hearing, and the matter was transmitted to the Office of Administrative Law where an Administrative Law Judge conducted a hearing and issued an initial decision, finding that the agency had properly terminated I.G.\u2019s benefits. The ALJ concluded that I.G. was resource ineligible because she did not elect against her husband\u2019s estate. The judge found that one-third of E.G.\u2019s residuary estate, totaling $44,323.87, was countable \u201crendering [I.G.] resource ineligible for the Medicaid Only program.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b315-9\">The Director of DMAHS adopted the ALJ\u2019s conclusions in a final decision. The Director explained that \u201cthe issue here is the money used to fund the trust\u201d and concluded that by \u201cconsenting to the will, [I.G.] used her 1/3 elective share to fund the trust,\u201d and the \u201crefusal to elect against the estate is considered a transfer of assets she [was] entitled to receive under law.\u201d I.G., through J.K., appealed from this final decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>Our review of an agency decision is \u201climited.\u201d <em>In re Taylor, </em>158 <em>N.J. </em>644, 656, 731 A.2d 35 (1999). \u201cUnless a [c]ourt finds that the agency\u2019s action was arbitrary, capricious, or unreasonable, the agency\u2019s ruling should not be disturbed.\u201d <em>Brady v. Bd. of Review, </em>152 <em>N.J. </em>197, 210, 704 A.2d 547 (1997). \u201cIn reviewing agency action, the fundamental consideration is that a court may not substitute its judgment for the expertise of an agency <em>\u2018so </em>long as that action is statutorily authorized and not otherwise defective because arbitrary or unreasonable.\u2019 \u201d <em>Williams v. Dep\u2019t of Human Servs., </em>116 <em>N.J. </em>102, 107, 561 A.2d 244 (1989) (quoting <em>Dougherty v. Dep\u2019t of Human Servs., </em>91 <em>N.J. </em>1, 12, 449 A.2d 1235 (1982)). Although \u201c[a]ppellate courts must defer to an agency\u2019s expertise and superior knowledge of a particular field,\u201d this court need not give such deference to an agency\u2019s interpretation of law. <em>Greenwood v. State Police Training Ctr., </em>127 <em>N.J. </em>500, 513, 606 A.2d 336 (1992). Here, there are no facts in dispute, and we deal solely with a question of law; whether I.G. could have elected against E.G.\u2019s estate and, if so, whether the failure to do so would constitute a disposal of assets for less than fair market value during the statutorily defined period of time, thereby requiring an ineligibility period for the Medicaid program.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">Medicaid is a federal-state program \u201ccreated to provide medical assistance to the poor at the expense of the public.\u201d <em>Mistrick v. Div. of Med. Assistance &amp; Health Servs., </em>154 <em>N.J. </em>158, 165, 712 A.2d 188 (1998) (citing <em>Atkins v. Rivera, </em>477 <em>U.S. </em>154, 156, 106 <em>S.Ct. </em>2456, 2458, 91 L.Ed.2d 131, 137 (1986)). \u201cThe Federal Government shares the costs of medical assistance with states that elect to participate in the Medicaid program.\u201d <em>Estate of DeMartino v. Div. of Med. Assistance &amp; Health Servs., </em>373 <em>N.J.Super. </em>210, 217, 861 A.2d 138 (App.Div.2004), <em>certif. denied, </em>182 <em>N.J. </em>425, 866 A.2d 982 (2005). New Jersey participates in the Medicaid program through the enactment of the New Jersey Medical Assistance and Health Services Act, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4D-1 to - 19.1. In New Jersey, DMAHS, an agency within the Department <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>of Human Services, is responsible for administering the program, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4D-4, with the assistance of the county boards of social services.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">The Commissioner of the Department of Human Services has adopted regulations governing participation in New Jersey\u2019s \u201cMedicaid Only\u201d program, including income and resource eligibility standards. <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10:71-1.1 to -9.5. \u201c[I]f the total value of an individual\u2019s resources exceeds $2,000,\u201d that individual is ineligible for the Medicaid program. <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10:71-4.5(c); <em>see also N.J.A.C. </em>10:71\u20144.8(a)(2); 42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1396r-5.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-7\">\u201cIn order to be considered in the determination of eligibility, a resource must be \u2018available\u2019 ____ to an individual.\u201d <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10:71-4.1(c). A resource is considered \u201cavailable\u201d when the individual has the \u201cright, authority, or power to liquidate real or personal property, or his or her share of it\u201d or where resources have been \u201cdeemed available to the applicant.\u201d <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10:71-4.1(c)1 and 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-10\">In determining the effect of a transfer of assets, assets are defined to include \u201call income and resources of the individual and ____income and resources which the individual ... is entitled to but does not receive because of action or inaction by the individual ... or by any person ... with the legal authority to act in place of or on behalf of the individual!.]\u201d <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10:71-4.10(b)3. The regulations specifically identify the waiver of an inheritance, \u201cincluding spousal elective share pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>3B:8-10,\u201d as an example of an asset that if disposed of or transferred for less than fair market value in the requisite time period would render the individual ineligible for Medicaid. <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10:71-4.10(a) and (b)3ii.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-13\">It is well accepted that DMAHS may not take any actions regarding Medicaid that are inconsistent with the federal law and regulations. <em>See, e.g., Estate of F.K. v. Div. of Med. Assistance and Health Servs., </em>374 <em>N.J.Super. </em>126, 133, 863 A.2d 1065 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>184 <em>N.J. </em>209, 876 A.2d 283 (2005). States <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>administering Medicaid may not apply a more restrictive methodology for evaluating eligibility than is provided in federal law. 42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1396a(r)(2)A.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">In this instance, however, the federal law is similar to New Jersey\u2019s and defines assets as including \u201cany income or resources which the individual or such individual\u2019s spouse is entitled to but does not receive because of action ... (A) by the individual or such individual\u2019s spouse, (B) by a person ... with legal authority to act in place of or on behalf of the individual ... or (C) by any person ... acting at the direction or upon request of the individual^]\u201d 42 <em>U.S.C.A. \u00a7 </em>1396(h)(1); <em>see also, </em>Transmittal Number 64, <em>State Medicaid Manual </em>\u00a7 3257B.3 (explaining \u201cthe term \u2018assets an individual or spouse is entitled to\u2019 includes assets to which the individual is entitled or would be entitled if action had not been taken to avoid receiving the assets\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b318-6\">I.G. argues that DMAHS, by finding I.G. ineligible, has in effect interpreted our eligibility rules more restrictively than the federal regulations permit. According to I.G., the trust was an excludable asset and resources classified as excludable are not considered in determining Medicaid eligibility. <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10:71-4.4(a). Specifically, I.G. asserts that trusts that are established by a spouse\u2019s will are excludable. <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10:71 \u2014 4.4(b)6i; <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10:71-4.11(d); 42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>1396p(d)(2)A.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-7\">DMAHS argues in response that testamentary trusts are not excluded resources for the purpose of determining Medicaid eligibility, but are \u201cdealt with using applicable cash assistance program policies.\u201d <em>State Medicaid Manual </em>\u00a7 3259.1A.1. I.G. concedes, however, that whatever remains in the trust after her death will be available to reimburse the State for Medicaid benefits expended on I.G.\u2019s behalf. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4D-7.2; 42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>1396p(b)(1)(B); <em>see DeMartino, supra, </em>373 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 217-220, 861 A.2d 138.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-9\">In any event, we need not resolve this dispute because DMAHS has not argued that the entire trust is available to I.G. for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>Medicaid purposes.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Regardless of the trust\u2019s status vis a vis Medicaid eligibility, the funds at issue here are not trust funds. What is at issue are the monies that were utilized to establish the trust, i.e., E.G.\u2019s residuary estate comprised mostly of the monies received from the sale of the marital home, which was titled solely in E.G.\u2019s name.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-6\">Because we focus on the time period preceding the transfer of the residuary estate to the trust, we also need not resolve I.G.\u2019s contention that the transfer of E.G.\u2019s remaining assets to the trust was excludable under <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10:71-4.10(b)(8). That rule excludes from transfer penalties \u201ca transfer of assets ... for the sole benefit of a spouse ... arranged in such a way that no individual except the spouse ... can, in any way, benefit from the assets transferred either at the time of the transfer, or at any time in the future.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>We need not resolve whether this transfer could not, in any way, benefit another person even after I.G.\u2019s death.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Instead, we review only whether DMAHS correctly decided that J.K., on behalf of I.G., had the \u201cright, authority, or power\u201d to access one-third of E.G.\u2019s residuary estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-7\">Under the terms of E.G.\u2019s will, once the residuary was transferred to the trust, the funds became subject to the sole discretion of the trustee and hence unavailable to I.G. \u201c[Resources which are not accessible to an individual through no fault of his or her own____include, but are not limited to, irrevocable trust funds.\u201d <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10:71-4.4(b)6. Distributions for I.G.\u2019s needs are to be made solely at the trustee\u2019s discretion. Thus, the trustee could decide, without any input from I.G., whether or not to distribute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>any portion of the trust funds for I.G.\u2019s needs, medical or otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">The elective share law, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>3B:8-1 to -19, provides the surviving spouse with \u201ca right of election to take an elective share of one-third of the augmented estate\u201d of the deceased spouse. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>3B:8-1. The \u201c \u2018augmented estate\u2019 consists of the value of all property of both the deceased and surviving spouse as well as other property transferred to third parties without adequate consideration before the decedent\u2019s death.\u201d <em>In re Estate of Friedlein, </em>230 <em>N.J.Super. </em>100, 104, 552 A.2d 1018 (App.Div.1989). Judge Skillman, on behalf of this court, has explained that the spousal elective share \u201cprovides a kind of statutory safety net to assure that a surviving spouse receives at least the value of one-third of the property owned by the decedent and surviving spouse, augmented by the value of certain property transferred <em>inter vivos.\u201d Id. </em>at 105, <em>552 A.2d </em>1018.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-6\">In granting J.K. her power of attorney, I.G. specifically authorized J.K. to \u201cdemand, sue for, collect, recover and receive all goods, claims, debts, monies, interests and demands whatsoever ... that may hereafter be due or belong to me.\u201d Therefore, when J.K., on behalf of I.G., consented to the will and elected not to demand I.G.\u2019s spousal share, I.G., in effect, waived immediate access to one-third of her husband\u2019s augmented estate, in this instance the residuary. The waiver, in practical effect, transferred one-third of the residuary to the trust without any compensation being returned to I.G. Such a transfer, under the pertinent regulations, warrants an ineligibility penalty. <em>See N.J.A.C. </em>10:71-4.10(a) and (b)3ii.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-7\">I.G. argues that she had no need to elect against her husband\u2019s estate because the trust was for her sole benefit, and we must assume the trustee will act reasonably and responsibly. But I.G.\u2019s need is not the test. The test is whether I.G. had the \u201cright, authority, or power\u201d over the funds, which would make them available to her. <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10:71-4.1(c)1 and 2. Because I.G. <em>could have </em>elected to take a one-third spousal share of her husband\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>estate, the share is available to her for Medicaid purposes, regardless of whether or not she actually needed the funds.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-6\">The pertinent regulations render persons ineligible for Medicaid who have \u201cdisposed of assets at less than fair market value at any time <em>during or after </em>[the so-called look back period], immediately before ... the date the individual becomes\u201d institutionalized. <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10:71-4.10(a) (emphasis added). \u201cPenalties of ineligibility\u201d are assessed for such transfers of assets that \u201ctake place <em>during or after </em>the look-back period.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10:71-4.10(b)(9)(iv) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b321-7\">Furthermore, it is difficult for us to ignore the fact that funds well over the Medicaid resource limit are accessible for I.G.\u2019s medical needs but may not be expended solely because the trustee believes that I.G.\u2019s medical needs are being fully met by Medicaid. Consequently, E.G.\u2019s decision to devise his estate to a discretionary trust, has the \u201cpractical effect\u201d of forcing the taxpayers of New Jersey to \u201cbear the burden of supporting [I.G.] while she resides in the nursing home and receives medical assistance. If [I.G.] had not rejected her share of her spouse\u2019s estate, then [at least] those assets would have been available to provide for her maintenance and health care without burdening the taxpayers.\u201d <em>Tannler v. DHSS, </em>211 Wis.2d 179, 564 <em>N.W.2d </em>735, 741 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b321-8\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b319-10\">Note the following administrative decisions dealing with excludability of testamentary trusts. <em>E.O. v.
