Two state troopers pulled over to assist. But defendants\u2019 reactions and inconsistent responses to the troopers\u2019 preliminary questions, as well as the condition of the vehicle itself, aroused the troopers\u2019 suspicions that criminal conduct or evidence of crime was involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-10\">Those suspicions led the troopers to request defendant Christopher Leach, who was in control of both vehicles, to consent to a search of the disabled vehicle. Leach orally consented, but initially refused to sign the consent form that was presented to him. Immediately after a trooper informed Leach that he did not have to consent, but that the trooper intended to call for a dog if he did not, Leach signed the consent form. A search of the disabled vehicle produced a half kilogram of cocaine and over fifty grams of marijuana. All six defendants were promptly arrested, and subsequent searches incident to arrest produced a small quantity of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>crack cocaine on defendant Michelle Elders; $8,000 in cash on defendant Ronald Stanley, and $3,000 cash on Leach.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">After an evidentiary hearing on the motions to suppress all of the evidence seized,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the Law Division judge granted defendants\u2019 motions on the ground that the troopers did not have reasonable suspicion to seek Leach\u2019s consent to search the disabled car, as required by <em>State v. Carty, </em>170 <em>N.J. </em>632, 790 A.2d 903 (2002). The judge also found that even if the troopers did have reasonable suspicion to seek consent, the threat to call for a drug-sniffing dog made that consent involuntary, and evidence seized thereafter was inadmissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">On appeal, the State first argues that <em>Carty </em>does not apply because the police did not initiate the highway stop. The State further argues that even if <em>Carty </em>does apply, the totality of the circumstances created'reasonable suspicion that defendants were involved with unlawful activity and that one or the other vehicle was likely to contain contraband. Finally, the State maintains that Leach\u2019s consent was voluntary.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-7\">Defendants contend that nothing about their conduct while attempting to repair the disabled vehicle on the shoulder of the Turnpike was sufficiently unusual to arouse reasonable suspicion of criminal activity or evidence of a crime, as required by <em>Carty. </em>Defendants further argue that Leach did not voluntarily consent to the search because his consent was coerced by the trooper\u2019s threat to call for \u201ca dog.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b244-8\">We agree with defendants that <em>Carty </em>applies in the circumstances presented. We agree with the State, however, that the troopers had reasonable suspicion to justify the request for Leach\u2019s consent to search the disabled vehicle that was under his control, and that under all the circumstances, his consent was voluntary. We therefore reverse the order excluding evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>seized from the disabled vehicle, as well as evidence subsequently-seized from the individual defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b245-7\">These are the facts adduced at the suppression hearing, where two state troopers were the only witnesses, but where the troopers\u2019 videotaped encounter was shown.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b245-8\">As Trooper Sean O\u2019Connor readily admitted, and as the judge found, events in this highway incident moved swiftly from a public-safety, caretaking action to investigatory questioning. Trooper O\u2019Connor and Sergeant Eonald Klem were patrolling the Turnpike together when they saw a disabled vehicle and a second car on the right shoulder of the inner roadway (the ear lanes) of the southbound Turnpike, at mile marker 86.5. The troopers were driving on the outer southbound roadway and did not stop because they were \u201cpacing\u201d a speeding vehicle.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> When they drove by on the inner roadway at 2:50 a.m., and saw the same two cars on the shoulder, they activated their overhead lights and pulled over behind the disabled vehicle. The video camera on the troopers\u2019 marked car was automatically activated when the flashing lights were activated.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Trooper O\u2019Connor carried the only microphone in his pocket.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-9\">The troopers called in to their dispatcher a description of the vehicles, a Lincoln and a Honda, the number of persons involved, and the plate numbers. Trooper O\u2019Connor testified that as they pulled over behind the disabled Lincoln, he saw two men under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>the vehicle, later identified as defendants Anthony Graham and Mareellius Love, and two women sitting on the guardrail, later identified as defendants Elders and Tasha Jones. A second car, a Honda, was parked in front of the Lincoln on the shoulder, and two individuals, later identified as Leach and Stanley, were seated in that car.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">Trooper O\u2019Connor approached the disabled ear and offered assistance to the men working on it. He described their reaction: \u201cThey were nervous. It appeared that they didn\u2019t want any more or further assistance from us.\u201d He climbed under the car with them. They told him that the gas tank had fallen down. The only thing the men asked for was a \u201cratchet,\u201d which the troopers did not carry with them. Trooper O\u2019Connor\u2019s inspection, after getting out from under the car, revealed that \u201cthe fuel filler assembly ... was ... disconnected and hanging free within the gas door.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"A5R\">Sergeant Klem also described the demeanor of the men working on that car: \u201cTo me they seemed very \u2014 initially when we first pulled up one of the males scurried out from underneath the vehicle and kind of gave us the \u201cA Okay\u201d sign like things were okay.\u201d Trooper O\u2019Connor made some inquiries of Elders, one of the two women sitting on the guardrail. She told him that both cars belonged to Leach, one of the men in the Honda. A computer cheek revealed that both cars were registered to someone not present at the scene, but neither had been reported stolen. The trooper asked the two women to remain on the guardrail for their own safety. He told Graham and Love to come out from under the car \u201c[f]or their own safety\u201d and \u201cto maintain some sort of control at the scene.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b246-6\">Trooper O\u2019Connor approached the Honda and asked Leach and Stanley to get out, because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>Leach confirmed that he was in control of both cars. There is no evidence that the driver of either car did not produce a valid license. According to the trooper, Leach said \u201c \u2018You can search the cars if you want.\u2019 He offered to let us do that.\u201d The motion, however, was argued and decided on the basis of Leach\u2019s written consent.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b246-7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>[t]he scene was very spread out. We asked them out initially not only to question them but to get more control over the scene. We were obviously at that point beginning to develop a reasonable suspicion there was some criminal activity going on and we wanted them out and contained within the scene for our own safety.[<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b247-6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>In brief questions addressed separately to Elders, Graham, and Leach, the troopers were told that the six had spent the weekend in New York City together, but they were also told three conflicting stories about where they had been: Manhattan, Brooklyn, or the Bronx. Leach said that he had been in the Bronx for a couple of days, where he had been buying clothes; Graham said they were all cousins, he was coming from New York, and spent time visiting family in Manhattan; Elders said that they were coming from Brooklyn, where they had been for two days. Although Graham said they were all cousins, he only knew their \u201cstreet names.\u201d The troopers became suspicious, and called for backup because they were outnumbered. Two other troopers arrived at 3:08 a.m.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-7\">In response to cross-examination, Trooper O\u2019Connor explained his raised voice at one point on the tape.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b247-8\">Q Who were you speaking to, trooper?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b247-9\">A At that point one o\u00ed the individuals, and I can\u2019t remember who, got up off the guardrail and somebody had to take control of the situation and it wasn\u2019t going to be them so I had to put them in their place.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b247-10\">Q You had to put them in their place?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b247-11\">A Yes. I needed to raise my voice in order to command my point. I\u2019m outnumbered. They know who I am. I don\u2019t know them. I don\u2019t know who I\u2019m dealing with. I had to raise my voice to keep in a position where we\u2019re all safe.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b247-12\">Q So at 3:06 A.M. all these people for all intents and purposes were being detained?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b247-13\">A Their ear was disabled\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b247-14\">Q I\u2019m asking you, they were being detained?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>THE COUET: Let the officer finish the answer and you have another question follow up. One question at a time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-5\">A Their vehicle is disabled. Again, I\u2019m asking them questions. They\u2019re free to go if I don\u2019t have enough suspicion to keep them there.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-6\">Q They were free to go but you had to control them by making them sit on the guardrail and not letting them move?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-7\">A Ma\u2019am, in that situation\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-8\">Q I\u2019m asking you yes or no?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-9\">A My safety comes first and I\u2019m not going to let somebody get behind me, no, I\u2019m not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-10\">Q They were either suspects or they were free to go. Which is it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-11\">A I was conducting an investigation at that point.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-12\">Q It\u2019s your testimony now at 3:06 A.M. they were all free to go?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-13\">A No, that\u2019s not my testimony. I was conducting an investigation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-14\">Q You just said they were free to go?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-15\">A I said if I didn\u2019t have enough to hold them they would have been free to go, you\u2019re correct, but I felt I had a reasonable and articulable suspicion some type of criminal activity was going on and I had to continue my investigation, you\u2019re correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-16\">Q So they were not free to go?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-17\">A At that point yes, that\u2019s correct.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b248-18\">Trooper O\u2019Connor sought Sergeant Klem\u2019s approval to request Leach to consent to a search \u201c[bjased on the conflicting statements by the occupants and their nervous demeanor.\u201d According to Trooper O\u2019Connor, after getting the sergeant\u2019s approval, he asked and again obtained Leach\u2019s oral consent to search the Lincoln.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-19\">Q Did Leach give you consent to search the vehicle?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-20\">A Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-21\">Q Was that first given orally?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-22\">A Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-23\">Q Once he gave you oral consent what did you do?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-24\">A I then brought him back to my troop car where I was going to fill out the consent to search form and have him sign it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-25\">Q Can you describe for us the procedures that you follow in executing a consent to search form?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-26\">A In New Jersey State Police we only ask consent to search after having a reasonable and articulable suspicion why we\u2019re going to do so. I would then read the subjects the consent to search form and tell them that they do have the right to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>refuse or withdraw their consent. It\u2019s all in the form. After we read them the form then they\u2019re asked to sign it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-7\">Q Did you review the consent to search form with Leach?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-8\">A Yes, I did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-9\">Q Did you read it to him?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-10\">A Yes, I did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-11\">Q Where was Sergeant Klem while you were reading the form?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-12\">A Seated next to Leach in the driver\u2019s seat of the troop car.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-13\">Q Was Christopher Leach buckled in the seat?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-14\">A No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-15\">Q Restrained in any way?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-16\">A No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-17\">Q Did he indicate that he understood the form?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-18\">A Yes, he did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-19\">Q If you know or if you recall, how old was Christopher Leach on September 17, 2004?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-21\">A Thirty-two.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-22\">Q And did he appear intoxicated?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-23\">A No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-24\">Q Did he seem mentally impaired in any way?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-25\">A No.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b249-26\">Leach was seated in the front passenger seat of the troopers\u2019 car. Sergeant Klem sat in the driver\u2019s seat, and Trooper O\u2019Connor stood outside the open front door on the passenger side. Leach was not restrained, although Trooper O\u2019Connor admitted that he was not free to leave. O\u2019Connor read the consent form to Leach, which included the advice that he had the right to refuse consent or to withdraw his consent at any time.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-27\">The trooper had repositioned the video camera to focus on Leach, and the trooper\u2019s testimony is consistent with the videotape at that point:<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-28\">Q What did Leach say when you asked him to sign the form?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-29\">A He said, \u201cyou can search my car but I don\u2019t sign.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-30\">Q Did you tell him that he did not need to sign the form?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>A Yes, I did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-5\">Q What happened once Leach said \u201cyou can search but I don\u2019t sign\"?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-6\">A I said \u201cthat\u2019s fine. You don\u2019t have to sign. We\u2019ll just call for a dog.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-7\">Q Were you planning on calling for the dogs if the consent to search form wasn\u2019t executed?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-8\">A Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-9\">Q Why?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-10\">A I had a reasonable and articulable suspicion there was some type of criminal activity going on and that was the next step.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-11\">Q Could the Lincoln Town car be moved at any time?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-12\">A No. The Lincoln car was disabled.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-13\">Q Did Christopher Leach in fact sign the form?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-14\">A Yes, He did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-15\">Q I\u2019m going to show you what\u2019s been marked S-2. Can you identify that for us?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AU\">A New Jersey State Police consent to search form. Photocopy of the form that was filled out that night.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-16\">Q Who signed that form?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-17\">A Christopher Leach.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-18\">Q Can you tell us the date and time?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-19\">A It was September 17, 2004, 3:36 in the morning.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-20\">Q Trooper O\u2019Connor, did you search the Lincoln?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-21\">A Yes, I did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-22\">Q And what area did you search first?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-23\">A I began with the trunk.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-24\">Q Okay. And once you had searched the back of the trunk what, if anything, did you do?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-25\">A I then allowed one of the occupants to continue work on the car so if the search turned up with a negative result they could get on their way a little more quickly.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b250-26\">Thirty minutes had elapsed from the time the troopers stopped at the scene to the time Leach signed the consent form.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> A search of the trunk and passenger compartment of the Lincoln revealed nothing. Under the hood, however, the trooper found a bundle wrapped in black tape, attached to the air filter assembly in the engine compartment. The troopers suspected that the contents of the bundle was a controlled dangerous substance. At that point, the troopers placed all six defendants under arrest. All were searched incident to arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b251-6\">We reject the State\u2019s contention that <em>Carty </em>does not apply in these circumstances, that is, where law enforcement officers did not initiate a stop, but initially approached an apparently disabled vehicle out of appropriate concern for public safety and in fulfillment of their community care-taking responsibility. In <em>Carty, </em>the Supreme Court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-7\">We hold that, in order for a consent to search a motor vehicle and its occupants to be valid, law enforcement personnel must have a reasonable and articulable suspicion of criminal wrongdoing prior to seeking consent to search a lawfully stopped motor vehicle. The reasonable and articulable suspicion standard is derived from the New Jersey Constitution and serves the prophylactic purpose of preventing the police from turning routine traffic stops into a fishing expedition for criminal activity unrelated to the lawful stop.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-8\">[170 <em>N.J. </em>at 635, 790 A.2d 903].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b251-9\">Writing for the Court in <em>Carty, </em>Justice Coleman began by recalling the Court\u2019s prior decision in <em>State v. Johnson, </em>68 <em>N.J. </em>349, 346 A.2d 66 (1975), adopting a stricter standard for consent searches in New Jersey than the standard prescribed under the United States Constitution by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Schneckloth v. Bustamonte, </em>412 <em>U.S. </em>218, 248-49, 93 <em>S.Ct. </em>2041, 2059, 36 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>854, 875. <em>Carty, supra, </em>170 <em>N.J. </em>at 639, 790 A.2d 903.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-10\">In <em>Johnson, </em>the Court held that a valid consent search must be not only voluntary, but also knowing; that is, the individual must be informed of his right to refuse consent and his right to withdraw consent. 68 <em>N.J. </em>at 354, 346 A.2d 66. In <em>Carty, </em>the Court further refined the standard:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-11\">What can be synthesized from a review of scholarly articles, eases from around the country, and the empirical data referred to in this opinion, is that despite use of the first-tell-then-ask rule or the voluntary and knowing standard adopted in <em>Johnson, </em>consent searches following valid motor vehicle stops are either not voluntary because people feel compelled to consent for various reasons, or are not reasonable because of the detention associated with obtaining and executing the consent search. Stated differently, hindsight has taught us that the <em>Johnson </em>standard has not been effective in protecting our citizens\u2019 interest against unreasonable intrusions when it comes to suspieionless consent searches following valid motor vehicle stops. We therefore must consider an appropriate modification of the <em>Johnson </em>standard.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number><em>[Carty, supra, </em>170 <em>N.J. </em>at 645-46, 790 A.2d 903].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">We see no reason to read <em>Carty </em>as narrowly as the State suggests: that objectively reasonable suspicion is only a prerequisite to a request for consent to search when a vehicle has been stopped by police, but not when the driver has stopped for other reasons. The potential for unwarranted police intrusion upon private citizens traveling our highways \u2014 the evil that <em>Carty </em>sought to address \u2014 exists in either situation. We view the suggested distinction as one that makes no legal difference.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b252-7\">We are satisfied that consistent with <em>Carty, </em>the totality of the circumstances in this ease justified the troopers\u2019 suspicion that criminal activity was afoot, and therefore justified Trooper O\u2019Con-nor in requesting Leach\u2019s consent to search the disabled Lincoln.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-8\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b252-9\">Even where police have stopped a motor vehicle on the highway \u2014 here, of course, defendants themselves had stopped to make repairs \u2014 we have held that \u201cthe police may question the occupants, even on a subject unrelated to the purpose of the stop, without violating the Fourth Amendment, so long as such questioning does not [unreasonably] extend the duration of the stop.\u201d <em>State v. Hickman, </em>335 <em>N.J.Super. </em>623, 636, 763 A.2d 330 (App.Div.2000); <em>see also State v. Pegeese, </em>351 <em>N.J.Super. </em>25, 30-32, 796 A.2d 934 (App.Div.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b252-10\">There is no bright-line rule for the permissible length of an investigatory detention; all of the surrounding circumstances are relevant factors. <em>See State v. Dickey, </em>152 <em>N.J. </em>468, 476-77, 481-82, 706 A.2d 180 (1998). The scope of the intrusion, such as whether the individual is handcuffed, subjected to fear or humiliation, placed in a police car, removed to police headquarters, or isolated from others, as well as whether the delay exceeded the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>necessities of legitimate investigation, are all important factors. <em>Id. </em>at 478-79, 706 A.2d 180. In <em>Dickey, </em>we held that the defendant\u2019s detention was overly intrusive and constituted a de facto arrest that required probable cause, not merely reasonable suspicion. The defendant, a passenger in a car that was stopped by a state trooper, was transported to the State Police barracks and effectively confined there; he ultimately consented to a search more than four hours after the traffic stop. <em>Id. </em>at 472-74, 485, 706 A.2d 180. Unlike the circumstances in <em>Dickey, </em>there is no evidence here, especially in light of the disabled vehicle and the close proximity of all six defendants, that the troopers\u2019 continued investigation was overly intrusive or detained defendants unreasonably.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">Defendants were stopped on the shoulder of a limited access highway as a result of the breakdown of one of their own cars. When the troopers initially stopped to investigate, defendants had already been parked along the side of the highway for some period of time. The delay caused by the troopers\u2019 investigation lasted barely thirty minutes, from the troopers\u2019 stop at 2:50 a.m. until Leach signed the consent form at 3:17 a.m. After finding nothing in the Lincoln\u2019s trunk, the troopers allowed Love and Graham to continue work on the Lincoln at 3:47 a.m., so that if the full search revealed no contraband, they could continue on their way. At that point, almost an hour had elapsed, obviously not an insignificant period on its face. But whether it was unreasonable under the circumstances, or whether waiting for a dog would have unreasonably lengthened the detention, are questions we consider in light of defendant\u2019s need to repair the Lincoln, and the fact that all defendants had chosen to remain with the disabled vehicle, despite the availability of the operable Honda. We cannot know how long either one would have taken \u2014 the repair or the dog \u2014 because the search and ensuing discovery cut short the repair and avoided any wait for a dog. All we do know is that the repair work had been unsuccessful for some period of time before the troopers stopped, and despite having another operable vehicle, defendants had cho<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>sen to remain on the shoulder of the highway.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">In order to justify a detention, the officer \u201c \u2018must be able to point to specific and articulable facts which, taken together with rational inferences from those facts, reasonably warrant [the] intrusion.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v.

In <em>Stovall, </em>the Court reversed our decision affirming an order suppressing drug evidence that was found in the defendant\u2019s suitcase after suspicious circumstances led airport police to detain the defendant and a drug-sniffing dog reacted to the suitcase. <em>Id. </em>at 351-55, 788 A.2d 746. The Court discussed at length the concept of \u201creasonable suspicion,\u201d emphasizing that there is no simple definition, that it is \u201c \u2018the totality of the circumstances\u2019 \u201d that must be considered, <em>id. </em>at 361, 788 A.2d 746 (quoting <em>United States v.

Here, however, the judge speculated that \u201cbeing nervous and giving conflicting statements could involve many, many reasons\u201d and disregarded those factors as grounds for \u201carticulable suspicion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b255-7\">There is no easy formula by which to measure \u201creasonable and articulable suspicion,\u201d <em>Stovall, supra, </em>170 <em>N.J. </em>at 361, 788 A.2d 746, and the determination requires a highly fact-sensitive analysis. <em>Nishina, supra, </em>175 <em>N.J. </em>at 511, 816 A.2d 153. \u201cFacts that might seem innocent when viewed in isolation can sustain a finding of reasonable suspicion when considered in the aggregate, so long as the officer maintains an objectively reasonable belief that the collective circumstances are consistent with criminal conduct.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b255-8\">The motion judge correctly recognized that the issue was whether or not there were objectively reasonable grounds for the troopers\u2019 conduct. As he said, it was \u201cnot about the subjective intent of the officers. It\u2019s about whether their conduct was objectively reasonable....\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b255-9\">Sergeant Klem, who was the patrol supervisor riding with Trooper O\u2019Connor (and the substantially more experienced officer on the scene), described the circumstances that first aroused his own suspicion that something was not right. First, when the troopers first stopped behind the disabled ear, one of the men under the car came out and gave the troopers an \u201cokay\u201d sign. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>The trunk was open, as was the gas tank door. Sergeant Klem described his reaction when he looked into the open gas tank door:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ao\">[W]ith my training, I come across and I have come across many different vehicles where things are hidden in different compartments, most likely drugs. The fact that the gas tank was not secured, I have never seen that before and X just felt that it was not right. Something wasn\u2019t right there.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">The Sergeant answered questions from the judge about the suspicion the gas tank raised in his mind. He explained that while he had never found drugs in a gas tank filler door assembly, he had conducted motor vehicle searches on account of finding a \u201cloose part or some part of a vehicle that had been apparently manipulated or tampered with,\u201d and that raised a suspicion of hidden dings.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-6\">Here, the troopers found a disabled vehicle whose driver and passenger, while trying to effect repairs, appeared nervous at their presence and anxious for them to leave without providing further assistance. The disabled vehicle had a loose gas tank, and the troopers knew from experience that contraband is often hidden in odd places in a motor vehicle. There were six individuals traveling together in two cars, neither of which was owned by any of them. Two individuals, including the person said to be \u201cin charge\u201d of both cars, were sitting in a second car that was parked ahead of the disabled car, having chosen to remain alongside rather than seek help or continue their trip.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-7\">Although the six were described as \u201ccousins,\u201d heading home to North Carolina, they did not know each other\u2019s full names. And although they were supposed to have been together in New York City, the troopers were given three different locations where supposedly they had been. Just as the Court found in <em>Stovall, </em>we are satisfied, \u201cbased on this evidence and the template of common sense, [that the troopers] had more than a \u2018hunch.\u2019 [They] had the responsibility not to turn a blind eye to what [they] heard and saw; [they] had the concomitant right to act as [they] did.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 371, 788 A.2d 746.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-8\">In finding that the troopers did not have reasonable suspicion to justify a request for consent to search, the motion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>judge emphasized Trooper O\u2019Connor\u2019s testimony that shortly after the troopers pulled over and asked what was happening, Graham and Love appeared \u201cnervous.\u201d The judge found that signs of nervousness when confronted with a law enforcement officer do not constitute reasonable suspicion. Nervousness alone is not a reasonable basis for suspecting criminal conduct or the presence of contraband. \u201cNervousness and furtive gestures may, in conjunction with other objective facts, justify a <em>Terry </em>search, but ordinarily \u2018[m]ere furtive gestures of an occupant of an automobile do not give rise to an articulable suspicion suggesting criminal activity.\u2019 \u201d <em>Carty, supra, </em>170 <em>N.J. </em>at 648, 790 A.2d 903 (alternation in original) (quoting <em>State v. Lund, </em>119 <em>N.J. </em>35, 47, 573 A.2d 1376 (1990)).</p>\n<p id=\"b257-6\">The trooper, however, described more than nervousness. What he said was \u201c[t]hey were nervous. <em>It appeared that they didn\u2019t want any more or further assistance from us.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added). With their car disabled on the shoulder of the New Jersey Turnpike at three o\u2019clock in the morning, and with a gas tank hanging loose from its nest beneath the car, drivers and passengers alike could be expected to show relief at the arrival of the troopers. The troopers could reasonably expect a law-abiding person in these circumstances to ask for help, to secure mechanical assistance or a tow, or, at a minimum, to protect them while they attempted to complete their own repairs. In that context, defendants\u2019 contrary reactions take on greater significance than the typical \u201cnervous\u201d reaction of an ordinary motorist who is pulled over by a police officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-7\">In <em>Carty, </em>the Court found that the officers did not have reasonable suspicion to justify the request for consent to search, and the product of the search therefore was inadmissible. 170 <em>N.J. </em>at 647-48, 790 A.2d 903. But the facts here are distinguishable. The trooper in <em>Carty </em>testified that he sought consent based on the nervous demeanor of the occupants and the defendant\u2019s and driver\u2019s conflicting stories. But the Court concluded that the stories did not conflict; the defendant\u2019s account was simply more <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>detailed than the one provided by the driver. <em>Ibid. </em>Thus \u201cthere was nothing more than nervousness to raise the trooper\u2019s suspicions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 648, 790 A.2d 903.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b258-6\">When the outcome of a suppression hearing is dependent upon the judge\u2019s findings of fact, including witness credibility, we defer to those findings as long as they are supported by sufficient credible evidence in the record. <em>See State v. Locurto, </em>157 <em>N.J. </em>463, 474, 724 A.2d 234 (1999). Here, however, the outcome is based upon the judge\u2019s application of the law to facts that are essentially undisputed. The most telling evidence at the hearing was the videotape of the highway incident, and the only witnesses at the hearing were the two troopers most closely involved in the incident. No material factual dispute or contradiction arose from that evidence, and no special deference to judicial factfinding is warranted. We are satisfied that the troopers had a reasonable, articulable suspicion that there was evidence of crime in the vehicle they sought to search.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-7\">TV</p>\n<p id=\"b258-8\">The next question presented by this appeal is whether the troopers\u2019 stated intention to call for \u201ca dog,\u201d after Leach initially refused to sign the consent form, constituted coercion sufficient to rebut the State\u2019s reliance upon Leach\u2019s written consent as voluntary. If there was a lawful basis for the troopers to call for a drug-sniffing dog, then there was nothing unfairly coercive about Trooper O\u2019Connor informing Leach as to what would happen next: without Leach\u2019s consent, the trooper in fact would call for a dog.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-9\">The test of a justifiable use of a drug-sniffing dog is reasonable suspicion \u2014 the same test applicable to justify a request for consent to search. <em>See State v. Cancel, </em>256 <em>N.J.Super. </em>430, 435, 607 A.2d 199 (App.Div.1992), <em>certif. denied, </em>134 <em>N.J. </em>484, 634 A.2d 530 (1993). In <em>Cancel, </em>we affirmed the denial of a motion to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>suppress and a conviction of second-degree possession of marijuana with intent to distribute. <em>Id. </em>at 432-33, 437, 607 A.2d 199. In that case, police officers used a trained dog to sniff all luggage that came from a flight from Arizona. <em>Id. </em>at 433, 607 A.2d 199. We described the officers\u2019 experience with illegal drugs brought into New Jersey from that state as \u201csufficient to satisfy the modest level of reasonable suspicion needed to justify the unintrusive use of dogs to sniff all luggage on such flights for narcotics.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 435, 607 A.2d 199.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b259-6\">After the dog signaled that the defendant\u2019s luggage contained narcotics, the officers requested her to consent to their inspecting its contents, \u201cadvising her that she could refuse but that if she did they would detain her until they obtained a search warrant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 433, 607 A.2d 199. We held that the dog\u2019s admittedly reliable reaction, combined with a false name on the defendant\u2019s luggage, gave police probable cause both to arrest her and to obtain a valid search warrant for the luggage. <em>Ibid. </em>\u201c[T]he officers\u2019 comment to defendant that she would be detained while they obtained a search warrant was a fair prediction of events that would follow, not a deceptive threat made to deprive her of the ability to make an informed consent.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 434, 607 A.2d 199. That conclusion is comparable to the situation before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-7\">The point is that both in <em>Carty </em>and here, law enforcement officers informed a suspect that they would do what they were lawfully entitled to do. In <em>Cancel, </em>police officers were lawfully entitled to obtain a search warrant based on probable cause. <em>Id. </em>at 433-34, 607 A.2d 199. Here, the officers were lawfully entitled to bring in a drug-sniffing dog based on reasonable suspicion.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>We are satisfied that the troopers had articulable and reasonable suspicion to justify calling for a dog, just as they were justified in asking for Leach\u2019s consent to search the disabled vehicle. Because the trooper had the right to call for a drug-sniffing dog, his advice to Leach was \u201ca fair prediction of events that would follow, not a deceptive threat made to deprive [him] of the ability to make an informed consent.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>That Leach changed his mind about signing the consent form and agreed in writing to the search immediately after facing the likelihood that the troopers would bring a dog, does not make his consent involuntary.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b260-6\">Finally, we address the question whether Leach\u2019s apparent request for an attorney earlier in the confrontation was a sufficient basis for the judge to conclude that Leach\u2019s subsequent consent was not voluntary. We are satisfied that it was not.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-7\">The audio portion of the videotape, including the largely inaudible interchange between the troopers and Leach, while they were at or alongside the Honda, satisfied Trooper O\u2019Connor at the hearing that at some point before he requested consent to search the Lincoln, Leach asked, \u201cCan I have a lawyer?\u201d The trooper volunteered that, if he had heard the request, he should not have continued questioning Leach,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> but he testified that he did not hear such a request at the time. Sergeant Klem also denied hearing Leach ask for a lawyer. The motion judge did not disbelieve the testimony that the troopers did not hear Leach\u2019s request.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-8\">With respect to Leach\u2019s apparent request for counsel, the judge stated the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>Very shortly after being questioned, apparently Mr. Leach, although it\u2019s not so clear to the Court which of the defendants was asking for a lawyer, but Trooper O\u2019Connor concedes that it was Mr. Ijeaeh, but more importantly, it appears that all of the defendants were sitting on the guardrail at the time that they were initially being questioned and for sure the Court has heard someone say, \u201ccan I have a lawyer?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-6\">Thereafter, the Court also overhears on the videotape that one or both of the troopers becomes somewhat impatient or annoyed, if you will, and begins in a loud voice to yell or to say to whoever is asking for a lawyer that you got a bad attitude and I don\u2019t need this bad attitude, so on and so forth.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-7\">Thereafter, the action moves to Mr. Leach being asked to sit in a State Police car. Sergeant Klem on one side. Trooper O\u2019Connor on the other side. And Trooper O\u2019Connor begins to read, as [counsel for defendant Love] has pointed out, the right to refuse consent at such a pace that the Court had difficulty understanding it and following it despite the fact that it would appear that Mr. Leach did not have trouble following it too much because he\u2019s shaking his head in the negative while it\u2019s being explained to him. He there again refuses to sign the consent form. There is a threat that the dogs will come and we will wait for the dogs.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-8\">It\u2019s interesting to me how all of you in your experience assume we know what kind of dogs we\u2019re talking about, but all the trooper said we will wait for the dogs and that\u2019s it, and I don\u2019t know whether they\u2019re talking about bomb sniffing dogs or drug sniffing dogs or any other kind of dog.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-9\">In any event, it seems like after some back and forth with Mr. Leach he then agrees to sign the form. This is after some cajoling from Trooper O\u2019Connor about him not wanting to take the weight for the other guys. It is after clearly Trooper O\u2019Connor did not really slowly read the form to him and explain it to him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-10\">I think in the totality of circumstances, the fact that we\u2019re in this limited access, the fact Mr. Leach is now surrounded by some officers, the fact all these defendants have already been detained for a substantial period of time, probably like a half an hour by that time or a little longer, the fact that Mr. Leach or someone else has already asked for a lawyer and that request has either been not heard or ignored, and I, unlike some of you counsel, I\u2019m not so satisfied that necessarily suggests the officers are not telling the truth because I would suggest to you that when you\u2019re out there at three o\u2019clock in the morning on the New Jersey Turnpike, trailer trucks are going by at 75 miles an hour, it is quite possible in the excitement of a moment that somebody might not hear such a statement, but whether they heard it or not is not the point.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-11\">The point is what does it say about Mr. Leach\u2019s intent to freely and voluntarily and knowingly consent, and I say it suggests as <em>one factor </em>he did not intend freely and voluntarily to consent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-12\">[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b261-13\">We recognize our obligation to give deference to the findings of the Law Division judge, as long as those findings are based upon sufficient credible evidence in the record. <em>See Locurto, supra, </em>157 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number><em>N.J. </em>at 474, 724 A.2d 234. But the rationale for according the trial judge\u2019s finding such deference is that those findings \u201care often influenced by matters such as observations of the character and demeanor of witnesses and common human experience that are not transmitted by the record.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b262-5\">Here, however, the observations upon which the motion judge explicitly made his findings and drew his conclusions came from the videotaped encounter, and that videotape is equally available to us.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-6\">Our own observations do not support the findings cited by the judge to conclude that Leach did not voluntarily consent to the search. First, Leach\u2019s question whether he could have a lawyer apparently occurred earlier in the recorded encounter, well before Leach was asked to consent to a search. It is undisputed that before Leach heard that Trooper O\u2019Connor would call for a dog, he refused to sign the consent form, whereas after that advice, he agreed and did sign the form. The issue before the motion judge was whether Leach\u2019s conduct was voluntary when he actually signed his consent to a search.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-7\">Second, the judge\u2019s description of how quickly Trooper O\u2019Connor read the consent form to Leach does not accord with our observations. The trooper\u2019s reading is easily heard and understood. The State\u2019s burden to prove knowing and voluntary consent requires proof that defendant knew he had a choice, and made that choice without coercion. It does not require proof that Leach was happy with the choices he faced.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-8\">Third, the judge cited the trooper\u2019s \u201cthreat\u201d to call for \u201ca dog.\u201d We explained above why the trooper\u2019s explanation, which we saw and heard on the tape, and which was calmly and quietly given, was not coercive so as to affect the voluntariness of consent.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>Fourth, the judge cited angry remarks by a trooper, accusing someone of having a \u201cbad attitude,\u201d and ascribing those remarks to a request for a lawyer.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> We perceive no relationship between angry remarks, earlier in the encounter, and Leach\u2019s decision later to consent to a search.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-6\">Fifth, the judge described Trooper O\u2019Connor \u201ccajoling\u201d Leach by indicating his respect for Leach not wanting to \u201ctake the weight\u201d for anyone else. We do not understand that the Trooper\u2019s comments, which are readily apparent on the videotape, were in any sense \u201ccajoling\u201d Leach to sign the consent form or affected his voluntary choice.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-7\">Reversed and remanded for further proceedings consistent herewith.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b243-11\"> The State filed separate Notices of Appeal respecting each defendant. However, the briefs submitted by the State are identical in each appeal and each of the defendant's briefs is also identical.
