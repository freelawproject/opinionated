Defendant beneficiaries appeal from a May 6, 2005 summary judgment declaring plaintiff beneficiaries to be the validly adopted children of Maria Fenton (Maria) for all purposes, including any rights that her issue enjoy under the trust agreement. For reasons that follow, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-7\">By way of background, on November 29, 1966, the settlor, Foster Fenton (Foster), created a revocable deed of trust which he subsequently amended five times: July 31,1968; July 15,1969; March 4, 1971; August 18, 1971; and March 3, 1972. The trust named Hillary Gans and Mercantile-Safe Deposit &amp; Trust Company (Mercantile) as the trustees. Foster signed the original trust and all of the amendments in Maryland, and was a resident of Maryland at the time of his death in 1974. Gans also resided in Maryland, and Mercantile\u2019s principal office was located there. By its own terms, the trust was governed by Maryland law.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-8\">The trust provided that Foster would receive the entire net income of the trust estate as long as he lived. Thereafter, the trust income would be paid to his wife, and upon her death, to Foster\u2019s four brothers and their widows. After the brothers and widows passed away, one-tenth of the net income would be paid to each of Foster\u2019s then-living nieces and nephews.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-9\">Upon the death of the nieces or nephews, their respective shares of the trust income would pass to the deceased\u2019s \u201cissue\u201d. If there were no living issue, then that beneficiary\u2019s portion of the income would be shared by the remaining beneficiaries. The trust further provided that twenty-one years after the death of the last niece or nephew, the trust principal would be distributed to the remaining beneficiaries and their issue per stirpes.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-10\">Specifically, Article II, as amended on August 18,1971, provided in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b437-11\">(e) A one-tenth portion of net income ... shall be paid to each niece or nephew of the Settlor who survives the Settlor for her or his remaining life. Upon the death of any such niece or nephew, and in the ease of any niece or nephew who is not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>living when the said portion of such income would otherwise be payable to her or to him, such portion shall be paid to the issue of such deceased niece or nephew living from time to time as the income is payable, per stirpes and not per capita, such issue taking the portion of income the deceased niece or nephew would have received if living. If there are no such living issue, the portion shall be paid, per stirpes and not per capita, to (i) the nieces and nephews and (ii) the issue of any deceased niece or nephew who are living at the time the income would otherwise be payable to such deceased niece or nephew.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">The trust definitions for child, children and issue provided that \u201cchild\u201d or \u201cchildren\u201d meant</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-6\">lawful blood descendants in the first degree of the parent designated, and references to \u201cissue\u201d mean lawful blood descendants in the first, second, or any other degree of the ancestor designated, provided always, however, that <em>an adopted, child and such adopted child\u2019s lawful blood, descendants shall be considered in this instrument as lawful blood descendants of the adopting parent or parents </em>and of anyone who is by blood or adoption an ancestor of the adopting parent or of either of the adopting parents____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-7\">[(emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b438-8\">However, the trust expressly excluded any child adopted by any of the settlor\u2019s brothers after the date of execution of the trust agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-9\">Maria was Foster\u2019s niece, a natural daughter of one of Foster\u2019s brothers. She resided in Bethlehem Township, Hunterdon County. Maria\u2019s only marriage was annulled in 1953, and she had no natural children. In 1991, when she was sixty-years old, Maria adopted four adults: plaintiffs, Bruce Lea Lauriault, Sally Vaughan Lauriault and Elizabeth Chandler Lauriault Pearson, and Virginia Lewis Lauriault, who predeceased Maria. They were the orphaned children of Maria\u2019s first cousin; their grandmother was Maria\u2019s mother\u2019s sister.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-10\">Prior to the adoption, on September 18, 1990, Maria\u2019s attorney informed the corporate trustee, Mercantile, that Maria was contemplating the adult adoptions and sought the advice of its legal department as to whether the adoptions would entitle the adult adoptees to be beneficiaries under the trust. Specifically, Maria\u2019s attorney wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-11\">I represent Maria B. Fenton who has contacted me concerning the possibility of adopting four adult persons so they might succeed to the income paid under the trust upon the death of Miss Fenton.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b439-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>My reading of Article II of the Foster T. Fenton Revocable Trust Agreement leads me to conclude that persons adopted by Miss Fenton can succeed as income beneficiaries upon her death.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b439-6\">In his letter dated October 11, 1990, Frank W. Waxman, Mercantile\u2019s vice president, agreed that upon her death, Maria\u2019s trust income would be paid per stirpes to the adoptees who survived her.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-7\">At the adult adoption hearing on July 26, 1991, Maria testified that she had known the four adults \u201csince they were born.\u201d Bruce testified that he lived in Georgia and had known Maria since 1974, but that his \u201cmajor contact\u201d with her \u201cin the last 15, 16 years\u201d took place three years previously at his grandmother\u2019s ninetieth birthday party. Sally, who also lived in Georgia, first met Maria in 1988 and since then had maintained contact with her mostly by telephone. Elizabeth and Virginia testified that they had recently met Maria. For about a year prior to the adoption hearing, Elizabeth and Maria exchanged telephone calls, letters, and pictures. Virginia and Maria exchanged telephone calls \u201cfor about a year or two.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b439-8\">At the hearing, Maria told the court that she was seeking the adoption because she wanted to have a \u201cnice, close family\u201d and had no children of her own. Maria also told the court that she received about $30,000 a year as a beneficiary under a Maryland trust agreement and that her adopted adult children would receive something under the trust after she died. Based upon the testimony and pleadings, the court was satisfied that the statutory requirements were met and entered a judgment of adoption on July 16,1991.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-9\">On March 3, 1992, Maria\u2019s attorney delivered to Mercantile copies of the final judgment and amended birth certificates. In his transmittal letter, the attorney wrote: \u201cNow that Maria B. Fenton has adopted these four persons, it is my understanding they will be considered her children with respect to the trust agreement of the late Foster T. Fenton.\u201d On May 20,1992, W.C. Smith at Mercantile sent a response confirming that under then-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>existing law, the adoptees would take under the trust. Specifically, on behalf of the corporate trustee, Smith wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-5\">While I agree with the reasoning and conclusion based on the facts and the law that existed as of the date of his [Waxman\u2019s] letter to you, we have no way of knowing how the term \u201cissue\u201d will be defined when this trust terminates. If, at that time, there is any doubt whatever, we will ask counsel for the trust to give us a written opinion and may well ask an equity court for construction.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b440-6\">On February 28, 1991, prior to the adoption judgment, but consistent with her stated desire to treat plaintiffs in every respect as her children, Maria executed a last will and testament (1991 will) that bequeathed to the adult adoptees a one-sixth share of the \u201crest, residue and remainder\u201d of her estate. After the adoptions, Maria executed a codicil dated December 6, 1991, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-7\">I have adopted four adults, Bruce Lea Lauriault, Sally Vaughan Lauriault Wright, Elizabeth Chandler Lauriault Pierson and Virginia Lewis Lauriault, to create a relationship of parent to these four persons pursuant to Judgment for Adoption of Adults____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b440-8\">On April 19, 1993, Virginia died without issue. In Maria\u2019s last will and testament dated May 17, 2002 (2002 will), she included bequests to plaintiffs. Specifically, Maria bequeathed: to Bruce, her stock in Home Depot, Inc.; and to Sally and Elizabeth, one-third of her residual estate. Maria was receiving trust income before she died on June 1, 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-9\">Maria\u2019s siblings, whose percentage shares as trust beneficiaries were affected by the adult adoption, maintained that Maria\u2019s action was intended to minimize their interest in trust income. Her brother Randolph attributed her hostility to events occurring in the aftermath of their father\u2019s death. According to Randolph, in the early 1980\u2019s, Maria expressed concern that she would be written out of their father\u2019s will. At her suggestion, Randolph, Maria, and their sister, Nannette, agreed in writing that they would share equally their respective portions of their father\u2019s estate without regard to the distribution in his will. After their father died and left the bulk of his estate to Maria, she apparently <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>filed a lawsuit contesting the agreement with her siblings. She did not prevail, however, and the siblings each inherited a third of their father\u2019s estate, which included the trust income.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-6\">Consequently, on December 13, 2002, defendant trust beneficiaries (defendants) filed a federal court action seeking a declaratory judgment that the adoption judgment was invalid with regard to the trust and that the three surviving adult adoptees had no right to, or interest in, Maria\u2019s share of the trust\u2019s income or principal. Defendants also sought permanent restraints enjoining plaintiffs from filing any proceeding with respect to the trust in either Maryland or New Jersey, which relief was denied. On plaintiff adoptees\u2019 (plaintiffs) motion, the court dismissed the complaint pursuant to <em>Fed.R.Civ.P. </em>12(b)(6). Specifically, the court found that it lacked jurisdiction to determine the validity of the State Court adoption judgment and that due process did not require notice to them of the adoption proceedings back in 1991, even though it is plausible that defendants had constructive notice of the adoption. Defendants appealed to the Third Circuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-7\">In the meantime, on October 7, 2003, plaintiffs filed the present complaint and order to show cause in the Chancery Division, Probate Part, Hunterdon County, seeking a declaration that the adoption judgment remained in effect and was valid for all purposes. On defendants\u2019 motion, however, the matter was removed to federal district court where plaintiffs then moved for a remand to the Chancery Division. The court stayed the matter pending the outcome in the Third Circuit. In its June 15, 2004 decision, the Third Circuit affirmed the dismissal of count II of defendants\u2019 complaint, asserting denial of federal due process, but vacated the judgment and remanded the case as to the state law claims in count I. <em>Marshall v. Lauriault, </em>372 <em>F.3d </em>175, 184, 186-87 (3d Cir.2004). As to the latter, the Third Circuit held that the district court \u201cabstain from deciding [the] declaratory judgment claim\u201d if it felt that the state law questions were \u201cbetter suited for resolution in state court____\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 184. Without reviewing the Mary<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>land<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and New Jersey complaints to verify that the state claims would address all of the issues presented in the federal court action, the Third Circuit remanded the issue for further consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">On remand, the district court abstained from resolving the remaining state law claims identified by the Third Circuit. Instead, the district court ordered that all remaining issues were to be litigated in the New Jersey action and consequently, on October 12, 2004, the district court entered a consent order remanding the matter to the Chancery Division, Probate Part.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-6\">Actually, the only real issue before the trial court was the validity of Maria\u2019s adult adoptions. Following defendants\u2019 answer, plaintiffs moved for summary judgment. In granting the relief, the court found that the 1991 adult adoptions in issue complied in all respects with the New Jersey adult adoption statute, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:22-1 to -3, and that under Maryland law, the motives for these adoptions may not be scrutinized. Nevertheless, the court found that all of Maria\u2019s motives were permissible, including her desire \u201cto have a nice close family, her desire to provide for her adopted children to inherit from her, and her desire that her adopted children be treated as natural children for inheritance tax purposes.\u201d Consequently, contrary to defendants\u2019 suggestion, it was neither Maria\u2019s sole nor primary purpose to give her adopted children an interest in the trust as to divest defendants of their respective lawful shares.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-7\">Noting that Foster knew how to exclude certain classes of adoptees, the court specifically referenced Article III of the trust agreement and found that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-8\">[Ilf one of his <em>brothers </em>adopted children <em>after </em>the execution of the Trust Agreement, that adopted child of a brother would not take. He imposed no such limitations, however, on his nieces, nephews, or any other issue.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-9\">[Indeed,] [t]he [s]ettlor expressly permitted his nieces or nephews to adopt.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b443-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>Accordingly, the court concluded that Foster never gave defendants the interest they claimed was wrongfully taken from them by Maria, but instead conferred on each trust beneficiary, including Maria, the right to adopt children, which included both adults and minors, as provided by Maryland law.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-6\">Finally, the court rejected defendants\u2019 notice claims, as the Third Circuit previously had done. <em>Marshall, supra, </em>372 <em>F.3d </em>at 185-87. The court similarly found that the adult adoption statute did not require notice to third parties other than the spouse of the adoptive parent, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:22-1, and that the statute did not require notice to third parties whose interests in property might be tangentially affected by the adoption.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-7\">On appeal, defendants raise the following issues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-8\">I. The Adult-Adoption Decree should be set aside because Its principal purpose\u2014 to alter the distribution of Foster\u2019s assets \u2014 is contrary to New Jersey\u2019s public policy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-9\">A. This collateral attack upon the validity of the Adult-Adoption Decree is governed by New Jersey law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-10\">B. Under New Jersey law, adult-adoption proceedings are closely scrutinized, and are disallowed if found to be motivated by a desire to alter the distribution of a third party\u2019s assets.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-11\">C. The Adult-Adoption Decree is void because it was procured for an improper purpose \u2014 diversion of the Trust\u2019s assets.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-12\">II. Defendants had standing to lodge a collateral attack upon the Adult-Adoption Decree and did so on a timely basis.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-13\">A. Defendants had standing to contest the original Adult-Adoption proceedings, but were unable to do so because they did not receive notice.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-14\">B. Defendants\u2019 collateral attack on the Adult-Adoption Decree is not barred by laches because the attack was filed soon after it became ripe, and soon after Defendants learned of their rights.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b443-15\">Defendants collaterally attack the validity of the adult adoption because their claimed primary purpose \u2014 to alter the distribution of trust assets \u2014 is contrary to New Jersey\u2019s public policy. Essentially, defendants\u2019 argument is twofold: (1) the trial court erred by applying only the statutory requirements for adult adoptions under New Jersey law; and (2) the trial court erred by failing to closely scrutinize the adult adoptions for improper purpose. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>In New Jersey, \u201c[t]he right to adopt, either an infant or an adult, is available only by statute and is not a creation of the common law.\u201d <em>In re the Adoption of an Adult by G.V.C., </em>243 <em>N.J.Super. </em>651, 653, 581 A.2d 123 (Ch.Div.1990). \u201c[T]he [New Jersey] adult adoption statute is remarkably brief and succinct.\u201d <em>In re the Adoption of an Adult by C.K., </em>314 <em>N.J.Super. </em>605, 609, 715 A.2d 1030 (Ch.Div.1998) (citing <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:22-1 to -3). With respect to the criteria for adult adoptions, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:22-1 provides the standards, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b444-5\">The superior court shall allow an unmarried person of full age, a husband with his wife\u2019s consent, a wife with her husband\u2019s consent or a husband and wife jointly to adopt an adult person and may change the name of the adult, if the court is satisfied that the adopting parent or parents are of good moral character and of reputable standing in their community, and that the adoption will be to the advantage and benefit of the person to be adopted.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b444-6\"><em>[N.J.S.A. </em>2A:22-1.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b444-7\"><em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:22-2 outlines additional requirements for granting an adult adoption:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b444-8\">Such adoption shall not be granted, unless the adopting parent or parents are at least 10 years older than the person to be adopted and the latter has, in writing acknowledged by him as deeds are required to be acknowledged, requested the adoption and, if desired, the change of name. The court, upon being satisfied that the best interests of the person to be adopted would be promoted by granting the adoption, may waive any and all of the above requirements. Every such waiver shall be recited in any judgment of adoption thereafter entered.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b444-9\"><em>[N.J.S.A </em>2A:22-2.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b444-10\">The adult adoption statute reflects the State\u2019s public policy of allowing \u201cadoption[s] between consenting persons, with the ability to enter a contract, when there is a strong benefit to be gained.\u201d <em>In re the Adoption of an Adult by G.V.C., supra, </em>243 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 653-54, 581 A.2d 123; <em>accord In re the Action of M. for the Adoption of P., an Adult, </em>193 <em>N.J.Super. </em>33, 37, 471 A.2d 1220 (Ch.Div.1983) (\u201cThe purpose of [the adult adoption statute] was to permit adults who are qualified to enter a contract to obtain the sanction of law to enter into a mutually beneficial adoptive relationship.\u201d). \u201cThe [statute\u2019s] emphasis on good moral character ... indicate[s] the legislature\u2019s interest in avoiding adoptions [of adults] based on sham or fraud.\u201d <em>In re the Adoption </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number><em>of an Adult by G.V.C., supra, </em>243 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 654, 581 A.2d 123. By limiting the requirements, the \u201c \u2018[a]doption of adults is ordinarily quite simple and almost in the nature of a civil contract.\u2019 \u201d <em>In re the Account of the Tr. of the Estate of Nicol, </em>152 <em>N.J.Super. </em>308, 319, 377 A.2d 1201 (App.Div.1977) (quoting <em>In re the Estate of Griswold, </em>140 <em>N.J.Super. </em>35, 52, 354 A.2d 717 (Cty.Ct.1976)).</p>\n<p id=\"b445-5\">Applying the limited requirements here, the statute mandates: (1) that Maria was at least ten years older than plaintiffs; (2) that Maria was of good moral character and of reputable standing in the community; (3) that the adoption was to plaintiffs\u2019 advantage and benefit; (4) that plaintiffs requested the adoption and, if desired, the change of names; and (5) that the adoptions promoted the best interests of plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-6\">It is undisputed that Maria satisfied New Jersey\u2019s statutory requirements. At the time of the adoption hearing on July 26, 1991, Maria was sixty-years old and plaintiffs were thirty-seven-years old (Bruce), thirty-five-years old (Sally), and thirty-three-years old (Elizabeth). Maria had no children of her own, and by virtue of her age, would not have any in the future. Maria told the court that she was seeking the adoption because she wanted a \u201cnice, close family\u201d. There is nothing in the record to suggest that she was not of good moral character and of reputable standing in the community.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-7\">There also is no factual dispute that the statutory requirement that the adult adoptions \u201cbe to the advantage and benefit\u201d of plaintiffs has been satisfied. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:22-1. At the time of the adoption hearing, plaintiffs\u2019 parents were deceased. Maria acknowledged that she would be their mother. Although plaintiffs did not have an ongoing relationship with Maria until one to three years prior to the adoption proceeding, they expressly consented to the adoptions at the hearing and understood that they would be entering into a parent-child relationship with Maria. Additionally, they acknowledged in writing their desire to be adopted, and their willingness to change their names. Maria and plaintiffs main<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>tained their parent-child relationships for eleven years until Maria died in 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">Plaintiffs also benefited financially from the adoption. Although New Jersey\u2019s \u201cstranger to the adoption\u201d provision, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:22-3c, a, \u201ccreat[es] a presumption that an adopted child could not take property under an instrument created by someone other than the adoptive parent,\u201d that presumption disappears when \u201cthe instrument itself indicate[s] a specific intent that the adopted child should take.\u201d <em>In re the Trust for the Benefit of Duke, </em>305 <em>N.J.Super. </em>408, 428, 702 A.2d 1008 (Ch.Div.1995), <em>aff'd o.b., </em>305 <em>N.J.Super. </em>407, 702 A.2d 1007 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>151 <em>N.J. </em>73, 697 A.2d 546 (1997). Here, of course, the trust expressly defines children of beneficiaries to include adopted children and thus plaintiffs, upon Maria\u2019s death, will receive her share of trust income of $30,000 per year.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-6\">Despite Maria\u2019s satisfaction of all statutory requirements, defendants nevertheless contend that the adult adoption is invalid because its primary purpose was to alter the distribution of third-party assets and, therefore, violated New Jersey law. This argument fails for several reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-7\">In the first place, New Jersey does not require adoptive parents to indicate their reasons for the adoption. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:22-1 to -3. To be sure, courts are \u201cmindful of the possibility of fraud.\u201d <em>In re the Action of M. for the Adoption of P., an Adult, supra, </em>193 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 37, 471 A.2d 1220. \u201cThe prospect [of fraud] is not so remote with respect to adult adoptions\u201d because they lack \u201csafeguards ordinarily present in <em>child </em>adoptions\u201d such as \u201cthe obligation of support____\u201d <em>In re the Estate of Griswold, supra, </em>140 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 55, 354 A.2d 717. The court below, however, expressly found there to be no fraud perpetrated in Maria\u2019s adoption of plaintiffs, concluding:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-10\">At the adoption hearing Maria indicated that she had no children of her own and wanted a close family. Adopting second cousins is a reasonable act toward this goal, especially considering the adoptees no longer had parents of their own. At the hearing Maria also stated that the adoptees would become beneficiaries to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>trust income and accede to other inheritance rights pursuant to being lawfully adopted. There were no facts elicited stating that Maria\u2019s sole reason for the adoption was that the adoptees receive trust income and, even if that was her sole motive, this Court is not required to annul the adoption based on that reasoning.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b447-6\">Furthermore, in rejecting defendants\u2019 challenge to the adoption judgment because it gave the adoptees inheritance rights in a family trust, the general equity judge reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b447-7\">That argument is contrary to the language of the statute that expressly addresses the inheritance rights created by adult adoption; <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:22-3. New Jersey law did not and does not require the complainant \u2014 the complaint to recite all interest that an adoptee would succeed to in a trust or even specifically name the \u2022 trust in question.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b447-8\">We find no error in this reasoning.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-9\">In support of their claim of improper purpose, defendants rely on cases clearly distinguishable from this matter, mostly involving issues of a grantor\u2019s or testator\u2019s probable intent to include adoptees within the class <em>of </em>takers, which otherwise was not clear from the face of the instrument. The one exception is <em>In re the Action of M. for the Adoption of P., an Adult, </em>in which the adoption was denied because, unlike here, the adoptive parent failed to satisfy the statutory requisite that the adoption was for the benefit of the proposed adult adoptee. <em>In re the Action of M. for the Adoption of P., an Adult, supra, </em>193 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 38, 471 A.2d 1220. In that case, a twenty-nine year-old assistant university professor sought to adopt his nineteen year-old first cousin who was a university student and a Greek national on a foreign student visa. <em>Id. </em>at 35, 471 A.2d 1220. Although the plaintiff satisfied the statutory requirements of age and character, the court found that the only advantage or benefit to the prospective adoptee was the free tuition that he would gain at the university by virtue of being the son of a university professor. <em>Id. </em>at 36, 471 A.2d 1220. Because the adoptee planned to return to his natural family in Greece after finishing his education, the court concluded that the adoption was \u201ctransitory, without bona fides and with no apparent permanent purpose\u201d and therefore \u201cwould promote what amount[ed] to a fraudulent aim.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 38, 471 A.2d 1220. The court further concluded that the secondary motive for \u201cmain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>tain[ing] a close familial relationship\u201d could \u201cbe accomplished without an adoption\u201d and did not \u201cdetract from the fraudulent motive.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 87-38, 471 A.2d 1220.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-5\">As noted, the other eases relied on by defendants are trust construction matters in which courts have addressed the effect of adult adoptions on interests in trusts and estates where the relevant instrument was silent as to the settlor\u2019s or testator\u2019s intent. For instance, in <em>In re the Estate of Comly, </em>90 <em>N.J.Super. </em>498, 218 A.2d 175 (Cty.Ct.1966), the court denied the complaint for distribution of trust funds to an adult adopted \u201cfor the sole purpose of [obtaining] an interest in property.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 503, 218 A.2d 175. There, the adopted daughter of the testatrix\u2019s half-brother brought an action to compel distribution of her portion of a trust fund established in the testatrix\u2019s will, probated in 1936. <em>Id. </em>at 499-500, 218 A.2d 175. At the time of the adoption in 1965, plaintiff was thirty-six years-old and married with four children. <em>Id. </em>at 501, 218 A.2d 175. The court determined that the <em>sole </em>purpose of the adoption was to enable plaintiff and her family to remain in a home that they occupied in which her father (adopted) was given a life interest under his mother\u2019s will with the remainder going to his children. <em>Ibid. </em>Specifically, the court \u201cnoted that a few days after the adoption ... demand was made upon the trustee for [the adoptee\u2019s] \u2018share\u2019 of the trust, and [that the] action to compel distribution was commenced only two months after the adoption.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Significantly, in construing the provision of the will to ascertain and give effect to the testatrix\u2019s probable intent, the court found it unlikely that the testatrix \u201cenvision[ed] that her half-brother\u2019s \u2018children\u2019 would include an adopted adult.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 502, 218 A.2d 175.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-6\">Likewise, in <em>In re the Estate of Griswold, supra, </em>140 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 60, 354 A.2d 717, the issue was the effect of an adult adoption on a New Jersey will. The court found that \u201cthe primary motive for the [adult] adoption was to gain the benefit of the trust remainder for [the adoptive parent\u2019s] wife and her son\u201d, thereby \u201cdivert[ing] [it] from the children of [the adoptive parent\u2019s broth<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>er].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 63, 354 A.2d 717. However, nothing in the testator\u2019s will itself nor in the surrounding circumstances established that the subject of adult adoptees as \u201cchildren\u201d was ever discussed by the testator. <em>Id. </em>at 64, 354 A.2d 717. Under these circumstances, the court concluded that enforcement of a presumption treating adult adoptees the same as natural children would violate the testator\u2019s intent and constitute an abuse of the will. <em>Id. </em>at 60, 354 A.2d 717.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-6\">In fact, the only New Jersey case to squarely address the reasons underlying an adoption distinguishes between motive and the probable intent of a testator. <em>In re the Account of the Tr. of the Estate of Nicol, supra, </em>152 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 312, 377 A.2d 1201. Although its denial of inheritance rights to an adopted adult ultimately turned on the probable intent of the testator, who would unlikely have foreseen the possibility of her married son adopting an adult in the future, the court specifically noted that its holding would probably have favored the adoptee if the question was one of motive for the adoption:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-7\">If the result reached below had turned solely on the issue of Alexander\u2019s motive in adopting his stepchildren, we would be less inclined to disturb it, even though we suspect, notwithstanding the absence of any fraudulent <em>intent, that </em>Alexander\u2019s probable motive was to assure their sharing in the distribution of his mother\u2019s testamentary trust.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-8\"><em>[Id. </em>at 312, 377 A.2d 1201.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b449-9\"><em>See also In re the Trust for the Benefit of Duke, supra, </em>305 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 435, 702 A.2d 1008 (applying law at time of execution of testator\u2019s will and trust, to deny granddaughter, adopted as adult, the rights of \u201clineal descendant\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b449-10\">As is readily apparent, the present case is easily distinguishable. Nothing in this record suggests Maria adopted plaintiffs for the primary \u2014 much less sole \u2014 purpose of manipulating trusts interest to divest defendants of their rightful share therein. Maria\u2019s testimony at the 1991 adoption proceeding stands unrefuted and defendants offer no competent proof to support their contrary claim. Based on the undisputed evidence, the general equity judge found that Maria had several permissible motives for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>adult adoptions, including \u201cthe desire to have a nice close family, her desire to provide for her adopted children to inherit from her, and her desire that her adopted children be treated as natural children for inheritance tax purposes.\u201d The fact that prior to the adoption hearing, Maria\u2019s attorney wrote to the corporate trustee inquiring as to whether the prospective adoptees would succeed to the income paid under the trust, does not negate the court\u2019s findings. Indeed, Maria named plaintiffs in her 1991 will, which was executed before the adoption proceeding, and, less than five months after the adoptions, she executed the codicil stating that she adopted four adults \u201cto create a relationship of parent\u201d pursuant to the adoption judgment. In her 2002 will, Maria again made substantial bequests to plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-5\">Equally unavailing is defendants\u2019 argument that the court would have denied the adoption petition in 1991, if either Maria or the prospective adoptees had disclosed at that time that the latter would take an interest in the trust at the expense of others. On the contrary, at the adoption hearing, Maria disclosed that she was a beneficiary under a Maryland trust agreement, that she received about $30,000 a year in trust income, and that the provisions in the trust agreement extended to her children. Thus, the court was well aware of the trust and that Maria\u2019s interest therein would pass to the adoptees.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-6\">And finally on this point, there is no evidence in the record to support defendants\u2019 claim that Maria was hostile to her siblings and acted to deprive them of their rightfiil inheritance. The allegation is based more on impression than proof, and in any event, does not establish a material issue of fact simply because defendants never lost their own share of trust income as a result of the adoption. As the equity judge aptly noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-7\">Foster Fenton never gave defendants the interest they now claim was taken from them by Maria. Foster Fenton conferred on each trust beneficiary, including Maria, the right to adopt children, which included both adults and minors, as provided by Maryland law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b450-8\">Indeed, \u201c[w]hat, if any, effect the adoption had on the interests in the Trust of the other beneficiaries was a matter for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>the trustees and the Maryland courts.\u201d <em>Marshall, supra, </em>372 <em>F.3d </em>at 186. While New Jersey law governs the validity of the adoptions in this ease, \u201cthe legal incidents and effects of that status [adoption] with respect to property,\u201d are \u201cdetermined by the laws of\u2019 the state where the property has its situs. <em>In re the Estate of Griswold, supra, </em>140 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 41, 354 A.2d 717. Unquestionably, in this case, by the express terms of the instrument itself, Maryland law governs construction of the trust deed and the rights and interests of those named therein. And under Maryland law, parties are not allowed to scrutinize the motives for an adoption in determining the disposition of trust estates. <em>Bridges v. Nicely, 304 Md. </em>1, 497 A.2d 142, 147 (1985). Thus, even assuming the improper purpose alleged by defendants, the equity court was not required to annul the adoption for purposes of resolving the rights and interests of the parties to trust assets.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-6\">On this score, Maryland courts \u201c\u2018give[] full faith and credit\u2019 \u201d to \u201c \u2018[t]he status of adoptive relationship^] created by a valid final decree of adoption in another jurisdiction____\u2019\u201d <em>Evans v. McCoy, </em>291 <em>Md. </em>562, 436 A.2d 436, 441 (1981) (quoting <em>Md. Ann.Code, </em>\u00a7 80 (1957) (repealed 1997)). With regard to adult adoptions, the Maryland Adoption Statute,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Md.Code Ann., Fam. Law </em>\u00a7\u00a7 5~307(a) and 5-309(a) (Maryland statute), provided, \u201c \u2018[a]ny individual ... [a minor or an adult], may be adopted\u2019 by \u2018[a]ny adult.\u2019 \u201d <em>Bridges, supra, </em>497 A.2d at 147 (quoting <em>Md.Code Ann., Fam. Law </em>\u00a7 5-307(a), 5-309(a)) (citing <em>Ex Parte Libertini, </em>244 <em>Md. </em>542, 224 A.2d 443 (1966)) (first and third alterations in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b451-9\">In light of the statute\u2019s broad command, Maryland courts consider as irrelevant the fact that an adult adoption was for the purpose of inheritance, and instead presume all adult adoptees are included in class gifts to children. <em>See ibid, </em>(holding natural father could adopt biological children, born out of wedlock, to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>legitimate them). Therefore, under Maryland law, \u201cthere is no clear, societal consensus to support a judicially inferred exception\u201d to the statutory presumption that terms including \u201cissue,\u201d \u201cchild,\u201d and \u201cheir\u201d include all adopted persons. <em>Evans, supra, </em>486 A.2d at 446, 448-49 (finding adults, adopted in Delaware, were \u201cissue\u201d of their mother with respect to disposition of Maryland trust, regardless of motives, noting it was reasonable to presume an intent to include adopted adults where one adoptee had a \u201cclose relationship with the adopting parent [from pre-teen years] and the other ... was a cousin of, and from childhood personally known to, the adopting parent\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">Here, of course, we need not ascertain the grantor\u2019s probable intent because Foster expressly defined a beneficiary to include an adopted child. Moreover, in Article III, he expressly excluded children adopted by any of his four brothers after the execution of the trust agreement, but did not impose similar limitations on his nieces, nephews or other issue. Thus, the grantor\u2019s own actions, as well as applicable Maryland law governing trust construction and the effect of adoptions on trust dispositions, conclusively establish that plaintiffs, as adult adoptees, take under the trust in issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-6\">In sum, we concur in the equity court\u2019s determination that the 1991 adoption was valid as satisfying all the statutory requirements of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:22-1 to -3. Moreover, to the extent relevant, we find no competent proof, raising a material issue of fact, of fraudulent motive or improper purpose to divest defendants of their rightful due. Thus, in accordance with the express terms of the trust agreement and applicable Maryland law, we are satisfied plaintiffs are proper trust beneficiaries.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b442-10\"> In addition to the present action, plaintiffs filed a claim in Maryland state court (the Maryland case) seeking to compel the trustees to make distributions to them from the trust.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b451-10\"> <em>Md.Code Ann., Fam.
