Hahn, a resident and taxpayer of Warren County, commenced this action against the Warren County Board of Chosen Freeholders (Board) seeking an order requiring the Board to provide \u201csafe, healthful and suitable courtrooms and facilities\u201d in the County in accordance with standards that the court may deem \u201cappropriate and necessary for the proper administration of justice.\u201d Plaintiffs appeal from an order entered on September 9, 2005 dismissing their complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-8\">The present court facilities in Warren County were constructed in or about 1825 and were last expanded in or around 1960. Since 1960, the population of the County has grown from about 68,000 to 110,000. According to plaintiffs, the court facilities in the County are \u201cgrossly overcrowded and in a state of disrepair.\u201d Plaintiffs allege that the court facilities are \u201cunsafe and unhealthy\u201d and \u201cgrossly impair the ability of the judiciary, and other employees of Warren County, to perform their functions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b227-9\">Plaintiffs contend that, over the years, the Board has been made aware of the \u201cinsufficiency, lack of suitability and the overcrowded and unsafe conditions\u201d of the court facilities. In or about 2000, the Board retained the services of a consultant to evaluate the court facilities and make recommendations to ensure that the facilities were suitable and safe. According to plaintiffs, the consultants determined that the court facilities were inefficient, overcrowded and lacked adequate security and parking. The consultants issued a report dated March 20, 2002, recommending improvements to the facilities and suggested several alternatives, from expansion and renovation of the existing courthouse, to construction of a new courthouse.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-10\">Plaintiffs further allege that, at or about the same time, the Assignment Judge for the vicinage which includes Somerset, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>Hunterdon and Warren Counties formed a committee to review the consultant\u2019s report and make recommendations to the Board concerning the court facilities. According to the complaint, the committee thereafter communicated its recommendations to the Board but the Board \u201cfailed to act on any recommendation and has failed to make any improvements to the Warren County Courthouse, and in particular, the judicial facilities.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b228-4\">Plaintiffs claim that the County\u2019s court facilities fail to provide proper security as required by the State judicial system; do not provide for the proper separation of prisoners from the general public and separation of adult prisoners from juvenile prisoners; fail to provide proper facilities where members of the Bar may consult with their clients in a manner that would protect the attorney-client privilege; and do not provide facilities where members of the Bar may consult with each other. The complaint states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-5\">The Board of Chosen Freeholders has pursued and continues to pursue a policy of purporting to provide proper and adequate judicial facilities, but these efforts have been makeshift, temporary and are inadequate to rectify the continuing problems as established by the County\u2019s own retained experts.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">Plaintiffs assert that the maintenance and perpetuation of the present conditions constitute a \u201cgrossly improper and unlawful interference with the efficient functioning of the judiciary and other agencies\u201d in the County. Plaintiffs allege that the Board\u2019s failure to meet its obligation under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2B:6-1(b) to provide \u201csuitable\u201d facilities for courts has placed an \u201cundue and improper burden[ ]\u201d upon the judiciary. Plaintiffs further allege that the Board\u2019s failure to adopt and implement plans for the construction of courtrooms and related facilities is arbitrary, capricious and unreasonable, an abuse of discretion and otherwise violates the Board\u2019s obligation \u201cpursuant to law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b228-7\">The matter was transferred to the Mercer vicinage and on August 23, 2005, the Board moved to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. <em>R. </em>4:6-2(e). Judge Linda R. Feinberg heard argument on Septem<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>ber 9, 2005 and thereafter filed an opinion and order dismissing the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">In her opinion, Judge Feinberg concluded that plaintiffs could not maintain a cause of action under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2B:6-1(b) to compel the Board to meet its statutory obligation to provide \u201csuitable\u201d facilities for the courts. The judge further determined that under <em>R. </em>1:33-4, responsibility to assess and evaluate the suitability of court facilities had been conferred upon the Assignment Judge for the respective vicinage. Moreover, under <em>R. </em>1:33-9, disputes between the governing body of a county and the Assignment Judge \u201cconcerning the location, size, or other physical characteristics of courtrooms, chambers, office space or related facilities\u201d must be resolved, \u201cat the request of either party,\u201d by arbitration. Judge Feinberg concluded that an interpretation of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2B:6-1(b) that would allow a taxpayer or association to maintain a private right of action to enforce a county\u2019s obligation to provide \u201csuitable\u201d facilities for the courts would conflict with the allocation of responsibility and dispute resolution procedures mandated by the Supreme Court in the court rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-7\">Judge Feinberg also determined that plaintiffs\u2019 action was an action for mandamus. However, the judge determined that such relief was not a proper remedy in this case because plaintiffs were not seeking to compel specific action of a ministerial nature but were instead seeking to compel the Board to exercise its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-8\">The judge therefore dismissed the action but \u201cstrongly\u201d encouraged the Assignment Judge and Board to meet in the ensuing 30 days in an effort to resolve the issues raised by plaintiffs. The judge added, \u201cIn the absence of an agreement or plan of action, the court suggests that the procedures adopted by the Supreme Court to resolve these kinds of disputes be employed. In the interest of justice and the public, that is clearly the most appropriate course of action.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b229-9\">We were advised at oral argument that the Assignment Judge for the Somerset, Hunterdon and Warren vicinage has held meet<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>ings with representatives of the Board. There has been no resolution of the issues raised by plaintiffs and neither the Assignment Judge nor the Board has invoked the arbitration procedures under <em>R. </em>1:33-9.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">Plaintiffs contend that the judge erred in concluding that plaintiffs may not maintain a private cause of action to compel the Board to comply with <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2B:6-1(b). Plaintiffs recognize that the Legislature has not expressly authorized a private cause of action under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2B:6-1(b) but assert that a private right of action can be inferred from the statute. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-7\">In determining whether a statute confers upon private litigants a right of action, we consider: (1) whether plaintiff is a member of the class for whose special benefit the statute was enacted; (2) if there is any evidence that the Legislature intended to create a private right of action under the statute; and (3) whether recognition of an implied right of action would be consistent with the purposes of the legislation. <em>R.J. Gaydos Insurance Agency, Inc. v. National Consumer Insurance Company, </em>168 <em>N.J. </em>255, 272, 773 A.2d 1132 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b230-8\">This analytic framework was established by the Supreme Court in <em>Cort v. Ash, </em>422 <em>U.S. </em>66, 95 <em>S.Ct. </em>2080, 45 L.Ed.2d 26 (1975), for determining whether federal statutes permit a private cause of action. The test was adopted by our Supreme Court in <em>Matter of State Comm\u2019n of Investigation, </em>108 <em>N.J. </em>35, 41, 527 A.2d 851 (1987). In applying this test, we may give \u201cvarying weight\u201d to each of the factors but ultimately the result turns upon the Legislature\u2019s intent in enacting a particular statute. <em>R.J. Gaydos, supra, </em>168 <em>N.J. </em>at 272-273, 773 A.2d 1132 (citing <em>Jalowiecki v. Leuc, </em>182 <em>N.J.Super. 22, </em>30, 440 A.2d 21 (App.Div.1981)).</p>\n<p id=\"b230-9\">Our consideration of the relevant factors begins with the language of the statute, which provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-10\">a. Suitable courtrooms, chambers, equipment and supplies for the Supreme Court, the Appellate Division of the Superior Court and the Chancery Division, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>other than the Family Part of the Chancery Division, of the Superior Court shall be provided at the expense of the State by the Administrative Director in cooperation with the Director of the Division of Purchase and Property in the Department of the Treasury. These courtrooms and chambers shall be located in a courthouse or other public building so far as practicable.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-6\">b. <em>Each county shall provide suitable courtrooms, chambers, equipment and supplies necessary for the processing and decision of cases from that, county in the Law Division and the Family Part of the Chancery Dimsim.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-7\">c. A flag of the United States shall be displayed in an appropriate place in each courtroom during all sessions of the court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-8\">d. The sheriff of each county shall provide for security for the Law and Chancery Divisions of the Superior Court sitting in that county in the manner established by the assignment judge in the county.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-9\"><em>[N.J.S.A. </em>2B:6-1 (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b231-10\">Section (a) of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2B:6 -1 was enacted by <em>L. </em>1991, c 119, \u00a7 1. The other sections were added by <em>L. </em>1991, c. 177, \u00a7 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-11\">The Supreme Court has recognized that Title 2B \u201crecodified the division of financial responsibility between the State and the twenty-one counties that had been in place for many years.\u201d <em>Board of Chosen Freeholders v. State, </em>159 <em>N.J. </em>565, 568, 732 A.2d 1053 (1999) (citing <em>Law Revision Commission Comment to N.J.S.A. </em>2B:5-1). The \u201cdivision of financial responsibility\u201d in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2B:6-1(b) benefits the State by requiring local funding for certain court facilities. In addition, the requirement in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2B:6-1(b) that the counties provide \u201csuitable\u201d facilities for the Law Division and the Family Part provides a benefit to the judicial system as a whole, not to any individual who may use those facilities. Therefore, plaintiffs are not part of a class \u201cfor whose <em>especial </em>benefit the statute was enacted.\u201d <em>Matter of State Comm\u2019n of Investigation, supra, </em>108 <em>N.J. </em>at 41, 527 A.2d 851 (quoting <em>Cort, supra, </em>422 <em>U.S. at </em>78, 95 <em>S.Ct. at </em>2088, 45 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 36).</p>\n<p id=\"b231-12\">Furthermore, there is no indication that the Legislature intended to confer a private right of action under the statute. R.J. <em>Gaydos, supra, </em>168 <em>N.J. </em>at 272, 773 A.2d 1132. In discerning the Legislature\u2019s intent in this regard, we look to the statute as a whole and consider all of its related sections. <em>Franek v. Tomahawk Lake Resort, </em>333 <em>N.J.Super. </em>206, 218, 754 A.2d 1237 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>166 <em>N.J. </em>606, 767 A.2d 484 (2000). We also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>consider other statutes on the same subject matter and give full effect to \u201ceach constituent part of an overall legislative scheme.\u201d <em>State v. Hodde, </em>181 <em>N.J. </em>375, 379, 858 A.2d 1126 (2004) (citing <em>Matturri v. Bd. of Trs. of Jud. Ret. Sys., </em>173 <em>N.J. </em>368, 383-84, 802 A.2d 496 (2002)). <em>See also In re Military Service Credit for State Teachers, </em>378 <em>N.J.Super. </em>277, 282, 875 A.2d 978 (App.Div.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">The statute pertaining to court facilities is one of several statutes that define the \u201cdivision of fiscal responsibility\u201d between the State and the counties for the costs of our judicial system. <em>Board of Chosen Freeholders, supra, </em>159 <em>N.J. </em>at 568, 732 A.2d 1053. In 1992, the voters approved an amendment to the State Constitution which required the assumption by the State of certain costs of the judicial system that previously were borne by the counties. <em>N.J. Const, </em>art. VI, \u00a7 VIII, H1. The State Judicial Unification Act, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2B:10-1 to -9, was enacted to implement the 1992 constitutional amendment and, under the Act, the State is required to assume certain \u201cjudicial costs.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2B:10-4(a). The implementing legislation shifted to the State costs associated with judicial personnel and supplies that were previously paid by the counties but the counties remain responsible for the cost of providing court facilities for the Law Division and the Family part as provided in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2B:6-1(b). <em>Board of Chosen Freeholders, supra, </em>159 <em>N.J. </em>at 579, 732 A.2d 1053.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-6\">The plain language of these statutes shows that the Legislature intended to define the specific financial burdens that would be borne by the counties and by the State for our court system consistent with the 1992 constitutional amendment. The entities directly affected are the State and the twenty-one counties. There is nothing in these statutes to suggest that the Legislature intended to confer a private right of action to enforce any constituent part of this legislative scheme.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-7\">The history of the enactment of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2B:6-1(b) also demonstrates that the intent underlying this statute was the allocation of fiscal burdens, not the recognition of any private cause of action. To determine legislative intent, the courts may consider extrinsic evidence, including the history of the legislation. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number><em>Cherry Hill Manor Associates v. Paul Faugno, </em>182 <em>N.J. </em>64, 75, 861 A.2d 123 (2004) (citing <em>Burns v. Belafsky, </em>166 <em>N.J. </em>466, 473, 766 A.2d 1095 (2001)). A statute\u2019s legislative history often provides \u201cimportant insight into the Legislature\u2019s intent.\u201d <em>Watts v. Camaligan, </em>344 <em>N.J.Super. </em>453, 464, 782 A.2d 479 (App.Div.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">Title 2B was enacted in 1991 at the recommendation of the Law Revision Commission (Commission). See Senate Judiciary Committee, <em>Statement to Senate Bill No. 1347 </em>(January 18, 1990); Assembly Judiciary, Law and Public Safety Committee, <em>Statement to Senate Bill No. 13^7 </em>(June 7, 1990). In its Annual Report for 1989, the Commission states that <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2B:6-1 is one of four proposed statutes \u201cwhich allocate certain costs of the court system between the State and the counties.\u201d <em>Law Revision Commission Comment to N.J.S.A. </em>2B:5-1. The report states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-7\">The Commission did not deem it appropriate to recommend a change in the allocation of costs and, in these four sections, is attempting to reflect current law and practice. The underlying principle of the proposed sections is that the counties are responsible for the cost of the Law Division and the Family Part of the Chancery Division, while the State is responsible for all other parts of the Superior Court and for the Supreme Court. While some deviations from this principle now occur, it constitutes the overwhelming percentage of current practice.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-8\">\n<em>[Ibid.]</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b233-9\">The Commission\u2019s report thus makes clear that <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2B:6-1(b) was intended to recodify the existing law defining the respective obligation of the State and the counties for judicial facilities. The statute was intended to define fiscal responsibility, not confer a private right of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-10\">We are also convinced that recognition of a private right of action is not required to ensure proper enforcement of the statute. <em>R.J. Gaydos, supra, </em>168 <em>N.J. </em>at 274-75, 773 A.2d 1132. The Assignment Judge is the \u201cchief judicial officer within the vicinage and [has] plenary responsibility for the administration of all courts therein, subject to the direction of the Chief Justice and the rules of the Supreme Court.\u201d <em>R. </em>l:33-4(a). Additionally,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-11\">The Assignment Judge shall be the authorized representative of the Chief Justice for the efficient and economic management of all courts within the vicinage. The responsibilities of the Assignment Judge also shall include all such matters affecting county and municipal governments, including but not limited to budgets, personnel, and facilities.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>[B. 1:33 \u2014 4(b).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b234-4\">Pursuant to these rules, the Assignment Judge has responsibility for determining whether facilities provided by a county for the Law Division and the Family Part are \u201csuitable.\u201d The Assignment Judge also has responsibility for all matters affecting the county government, including those related to the adequacy of court facilities. Disputes concerning the adequacy of facilities provided by a county are addressed pursuant to <em>R. </em>1:33-9, which provides in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-5\">Any dispute between the county governing body and the Assignment Judge concerning the location, size, or other physical characteristics of courtrooms, chambers, office space or related facilities shall, at the request of either party, be resolved by submission of the dispute to arbitration.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b234-6\">In view of the Assignment Judge\u2019s broad administrative authority over court facilities in the judge\u2019s vicinage, the designation of the Assignment Judge as the individual responsible for all matters pertaining to the affected county government, as well as the procedure established by court rule to resolve disputes with the county concerning court facilities, recognition of a private right of action is not necessary to ensure that <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2B:6-1(b) is properly enforced. <em>See also R.J. Gaydos, supra, </em>168 <em>N.J. </em>at 280-81, 773 A.2d 1132 (no private right of action for agent to sue insurer for violation of insurance laws where statute vests enforcement authority in the Commissioner of Insurance); <em>In re State Comm\u2019n of Investigation, supra, </em>108 <em>N.J. </em>at 35, 527 A.2d 851 (no private cause of action to enforce statute mandating confidentiality of the investigations by the State Commission of Investigation where Attorney General has authority to enforce the law); <em>Jalowiecki v.

Those responsibilities include all matters affecting county and municipal government, including but not limited to budgets, personnel, and facilities; the supervision and efficient management of all court matters; the supervision, superintendence, and allocation of all judges and judicial support personnel; and the appointment and discharge of judicial support personnel. Assignment judges have the inherent power not only to provide the facilities, personnel, and resources reasonably necessary for the operation of the courts but also \u201cto compel the appropriation and expenditure of funds by the coequal executive and legislative branches of government to accomplish such purpose, subject only to bounds of reasonable discretion.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b235-8\"><em>[Ibid, </em>(quoting <em>In re Court Reorganization Plan of Hudson County, </em>161 <em>N.J.Super. 483, 491, </em>391 A.2d 1255 (App.Div.1978), <em>aff'd o.b., </em>78 <em>N.J. </em>498, 396 A.2d 1144 (1979)).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b235-9\">The Court added that, as \u201ca matter of comity\u201d it had exercised its power to administer the courts \u201csparingly and with deference <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>to the other branches of government.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>The Court noted that counties had \u201cserious and legitimate concerns regarding the budgets for the state trial court system.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 93, 533 A.2d 961. Nevertheless, the Court stated that its goal was to ensure that the judiciary functioned on a level so that \u201cthe administration of justice is not impaired.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 93-94, 533 A.2d 961 (quoting <em>In re Union County 1981 Judicial Budget Impasse, 87 N.J. </em>1, 3, 432 A.2d 807 (1981)).

Homestead at Mansfield, Inc., </em>111 <em>N.J. </em>21, 26, 543 A.2d 10 (1988) (quoting <em>State v. Profaci, </em>56 <em>N.J. </em>346, 349, 266 A.2d 579 (1970)). We are therefore satisfied that the Legislature did not intend to confer a private right of action to enforce the counties\u2019 obligation under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2B:6-1(b) to provide \u201csuitable\u201d facilities for the courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-6\">\n<em>IV.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b236-7\">Plaintiffs additionally contend that they may maintain an action in lieu of prerogative writs and seek a writ of mandamus requiring the county to provide \u201csuitable\u201d court facilities. In their complaint, plaintiffs allege that the Board\u2019s failure to provide appropriate facilities is arbitrary, capricious, unreasonable and violates the Board\u2019s duty \u201cpursuant to law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>Mandamus is an appropriate remedy: \u201c(1) to compel <em>specific </em>action when the duty is ministerial and wholly free from doubt, and (2) to compel the exercise of discretion, but <em>not </em>in a specific manner.\u201d <em>Loigman v. Tp. Com. of Middletown, </em>297 <em>N.J.Super. </em>287, 299, 687 A.2d 1091 (App.Div.1997). <em>See also Cohen v. Bd. of Trustees of University of Med. and Dentistry of </em>N.J., 240 <em>N.J.Super. 188, </em>199, 572 A.2d 1191 (Ch.Div.1989) (holding that mandamus is available only to compel performance of a specific, mandated ministerial obligation).</p>\n<p id=\"b237-6\">We note initially that to the extent plaintiffs are seeking to compel the Board to renovate, upgrade or improve Warren County\u2019s court facilities, their claim is necessarily premised upon <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2B:6-1(b). Indeed, plaintiffs\u2019 complaint indicates that they are seeking to compel the Board to act \u201cpursuant to law.\u201d The law that requires a county to provide \u201csuitable\u201d court facilities is <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2B:6 \u2014 1(b). However, as we have determined, plaintiffs may not seek relief under that statute. They may not otherwise seek to enforce the County\u2019s statutory duty to provide \u201csuitable\u201d court facilities by characterizing this case as an action in lieu of prerogative writs rather than a private right of action under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2B:6-1(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b237-7\">Moreover, mandamus is not an available remedy for the relief plaintiffs are seeking. Here, there is no allegation that the Board has failed entirely to provide court facilities in Warren County. Rather, plaintiffs contend that the Board has not provided facilities that are \u201csuitable\u201d for the judiciary and the public. As we stated previously, plaintiffs allege that the court facilities in Warren County are \u201cgrossly overcrowded,\u201d \u201cin a state of disrepair,\u201d and \u201cunsafe and unhealthy.\u201d Plaintiffs allege that the Board has acted arbitrarily and capriciously in failing to adopt the recommendations of the consultants who were retained by the Board to assess the facilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-8\">Surely, determinations as to what steps, if any, the Board should take respecting the County\u2019s court facilities are matters that entail the exercise of judgment and discretion. Plaintiffs are not seeking to compel the Board to perform ministerial acts. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number><em>Loigman, supra, </em>297 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 299, 687 A.2d 1091. Moreover, plaintiffs are not seeking to compel the Board to undertake a \u201cgeneral exercise of discretion.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Rather, plaintiffs seek to compel the Board to exercise its discretion in a very specific manner. We are convinced that plaintiffs may not maintain an action in lieu of prerogative writs to seek such relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
