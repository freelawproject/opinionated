The Board rejected appellant\u2019s procedural <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>and substantive claims, and based its decision \u201con the totality of his background, including the falsification of his academic record, his arrest one and one-half years before having his name certified, and his discipline as a volunteer fire fighter.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">We reject appellant\u2019s attack on the procedure utilized in considering his appeal from the initial determination of the Department of Personnel. The Board considered all facts relevant to the issue of eligibility and the Borough\u2019s request for removal of appellant from the list of eligibles. Furthermore, appellant ultimately received all the documentation presented to the Department of Personnel and had an adequate opportunity to respond.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-6\">With respect to the impact of appellant\u2019s arrest, the Board recognized appellant\u2019s contention that \u201cthe charges were downgraded to the disorderly persons offense of simple assault,\u201d that \u201che had the arrest expunged,\u201d that \u201chis arrest occurred when he was [nineteen] years old\u201d and that \u201cthis was his only arrest.\u201d However, the Board found significant the fact that appellant did not \u201cexplain the circumstances surrounding his arrest, which occurred only one and one-half years before his name was certified for the [] position\u201d and that he provided no \u201cevidence of rehabilitation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b544-7\">The Board referred to our opinion in <em>Tharpe v. City of Newark Police Dep\u2019t, </em>261 <em>N.J.Super. </em>401, 619 A.2d 228 (App.Div.1992), for the proposition \u201cthe presentation to an appointing authority of a pardon or expungement shall prohibit an appointing authority from rejecting an eligible based on such criminal conviction, except for law enforcement, fire fighter or correction officer and other titles as determined by the Commissioner.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b544-8\">In <em>Tharpe </em>we noted that an arrest \u201cstanding alone, may have no persuasive force in assessing an applicant\u2019s qualifications,\u201d but \u201cmay [nevertheless] warrant the removal of an appellant\u2019s name particularly where the position sought involves enforcement or administration of the law.\u201d 261 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 406, 619 A.2d 228. We further stated that \u201cthe relevant circumstances should be carefully considered\u201d in terms of \u201cwhether the circumstances <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>surrounding the arrest \u2018adversely related to the employment sought.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ibid, </em>(alteration in original) (citing <em>N.J.S.A. </em>11A:4-11). <em>Thorpe </em>relied on <em>N.J.S.A. </em>11A:4-10 and <em>N.J.S.A. </em>11A:4-11, and concluded that someone arrested could not be worse off than someone convicted of a crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-6\"><em>N.J.S.A. </em>11A:4-10 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-7\">Eligibles may be questioned as to criminal convictions and pending criminal charges. Eligibles for a law enforcement, fire fighter or correction officer title may also be questioned as to any arrest.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b545-8\"><em>N.J.S.A. </em>11A:4-11 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-9\">Upon the request of an appointing authority, the commissioner may remove an eligible with a criminal record from a list when the criminal record includes a conviction for a crime which adversely relates to the employment sought. The following factors may be considered in such determination:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-10\">a. Nature and seriousness of the crime;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-11\">b. Circumstances under which the crime occurred;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-12\">e. Date of the crime and age of the eligible when the crime was committed;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-13\">d. Whether the crime was an isolated event; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-14\">e. Evidence of rehabilitation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-15\">The presentation to an appointing authority of a pardon or expungement shall prohibit an appointing authority from rejecting an eligible based on such criminal conviction, except for law enforcement, fire fighter or correction officer and other titles as determined by the commissioner.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b545-16\">Here, we are not dealing with a \u201ccriminal conviction.\u201d In fact, we are not dealing with a \u201cconviction\u201d at all. To the contrary, it is undisputed that \u201c[o]n May 6, 2002, the charge was dismissed by the Ocean Township Municipal Court,\u201d and the arrest record was subsequently expunged. As the expungement dealt with an arrest and there was no \u201ccriminal conviction,\u201d we must consider whether the Board could consider the expunged arrest. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>2C:52-6, -27; see <em>also N.J.S.A. </em>20:1-4 (defining \u201ccrime\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b545-17\"><em>N.J.S.A. </em>20:52-27 provides that if an order of expungement is granted, \u201cthe arrest, conviction, and any proceeding related thereto shall be deemed not to have occurred and the petitioner may answer any questions relating to their occurrence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>accordingly.\u201d However, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:52-27(c) requires revelation of expunged records \u201cby a petitioner seeking employment ... with [] law enforcement ... and such information shall continue to provide a disability as otherwise provided by law.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Hence, reading <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:52-27(e) together with <em>N.J.S.A. </em>11A:4-11, an expunged conviction can be considered with respect to hiring an individual for a law enforcement position, and reading <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:52-27(c) and <em>N.J.S.A. </em>11A:4-10 together, an expunged arrest record can be considered, but the applicant can be no worse off than had he been convicted. The Board must consider the fact of expungement and its remedial purpose, and generally apply the principle of <em>Tharpe. </em>Thus:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-5\">The appropriate inquiry should be whether the circumstances surrounding the arrest \u201cadversely relate[] to the employment sought.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>11A:4-11. This is the statutory standard applicable when considering the impact of criminal convictions on public employment and it is equally amenable to the related question concerning the effect of an arrest on the applicant\u2019s qualifications. Surely, an arrest should have no greater disabling effect than does a criminal conviction. In both cases, consideration should be given to the nature and seriousness of the offense charged, the surrounding circumstances, the date of the offense and the individual\u2019s age at the time, whether the offense alleged was an isolated incident, and any evidence of rehabilitation. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>11A:4-11.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-6\"><em>[Tharpe, supra, </em>261 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 406, 619 A.2d 228.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b546-7\">These factors must also include consideration of the policy behind an expungement, <em>see In re T.P.D., </em>314 <em>N.J.Super. </em>643, 648, 715 A.2d 1048 (Law Div.1997), <em>aff'd o.b., </em>314 <em>N.J.Super. </em>535, 715 A.2d 994 (App.Div.1998), and the fact of expungement itself, and the Board must express why expungement of a mere arrest<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> should not control in the circumstances. The equivalent of \u201cevidence of rehabilitation\u201d is supplied in these circumstances by the foundation for the expungement. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>2C:52-3; <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:52-8; <em>N.J.S.A. </em>20:52-13.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>Accordingly, we must remand the matter for further consideration by the Board, particularly because it found significant that, notwithstanding the expungement, appellant did not provide \u201cevidence of rehabilitation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">The other reasons for decertification may or may not lead the Board to the same result, even if the Board does not consider the arrest. We do not pass upon whether such action would be justified and upheld under our limited scope of review. <em>See In re Taylor, </em>158 <em>N.J. </em>644, 657, 731 A.2d 35 (1999); <em>Karins v. City of Atlantic City, </em>152 <em>N.J. </em>532, 540, 706 A.2d 706 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b547-6\">The matter is remanded to the Merit System Board for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. We do not retain jurisdiction.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b546-8\"> The parties do not refer to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:52-27 nor to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>11:4A-10. Nor does appellant challenge <em>N.J.A.C. </em>4A:4-4.7 which implements <em>N.J.S.A. </em>11A:4-11 by reference to \"a criminal record.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b546-9\"> <em>N.J.S.A. </em>11A:4-11 talks only of the expungement of a \"criminal conviction.\"</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
