An Administrative Law Judge (\u201cAU\u201d) awarded her compensation. The Benefits Review Board, however, reversed for lack of \u201ctimely notice\u201d to Bethlehem. Petitioner claims that the Review Board erred since \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d supported the AU\u2019s decision. <em>See </em>33 U.S.C. \u00a7 921(b)(3) (\u201cfindings of fact in the decision under review by the Board shall be conclusive if supported by substantial evidence\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b100-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"2\">*2</page-number>The relevant facts are as follows: Mrs. Jasinskas\u2019s husband left the Bethlehem shipyard in 1945 or 1946. He worked in a shoe factory and in a bakery until he suffered a heart attack in 1970. He then stopped working completely. He had several more heart attacks over the next few years and died in 1977. His death certificate listed the causes of his death as \u201carte-riosclerotic heart disease \u2014 sudden death\u2014 natural causes.\u201d Two years before his death, Mrs. Jasinskas learned from his doctor that her husband had asbestosis. Because she was afraid to make her husband nervous, she did not tell him. In January or February 1978, about a year after her husband died, she learned from a television program that asbestos \u201cis a poison.\u201d She then saw a lawyer in April 1978 and filed a claim for benefits in early May 1978.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-4\">The relevant statute requires a beneficiary to give an employer</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AQ\">[n]otice of ... death ... within thirty days after the ... beneficiary is aware or in the exercise of reasonable diligence should have been aware of a relationship between the ... death and the employment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b100-5\">33 U.S.C. \u00a7 912(a). We must consider whether the Review Board correctly reversed the AU\u2019s award for lack of substantial evidence showing compliance with this provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-6\">At the outset petitioner argues that we should view the record through the lens of a special statutory presumption, 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 920(b), which says, \u201cit shall be presumed, in the absence of substantial evidence to the contrary ... [t]hat sufficient notice of such claim has been given.\u201d Evidently, the Board and courts are not completely certain about whether, or how, this presumption is meant to apply in cases like this one. <em>Compare, e.g., Stevenson v. Linens of the Week, </em>688 F.2d 93 (D.C.Cir.1982) <em>with Jackson v. Ingalls Shipbuilding Division, Litton Systems, Inc., </em>15 B.R.B.S. 299, 301-02 (1983). One might ask in this case, for example, whether the presumption is meant to lead the AU to conclude that the employee gave the employer notice before early May 1978 or whether it is meant to suggest (despite lack of proper notice) actual \u201cemployer ... knowledge\u201d \u2014 a special ground for excusing lack of notice when the employer has not been prejudiced, 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 912(d)(1). We need not delve into these matters, however, for here, insofar as the presumption applies, it has been adequately rebutted. Over thirty years passed between the time Mr. Jasinskas worked for Bethlehem and the time he died; the record contains no indication that Bethlehem knew anything about him or his whereabouts during this period; and Bethlehem\u2019s record exhibit 1, its \u201cFirst Report of Accident or Occupational Illness,\u201d states that the \u201cearliest date ... employer knew of [the death]\u201d was \u201cMay 4, 1978.\u201d Nothing in the record contradicts this statement. In fact, petitioner says in her brief that she \u201cis not claiming that Bethlehem Steel [actually] knew of her husband\u2019s asbestos-related death\u201d before May 4. Thus, there is) in respect to notice or employer knowledge before May 1978, (in the statute\u2019s words) \u201csubstantial evidence to the contrary.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b100-8\">Since no one disputes the fact that the employer had actual notice in early May, the issues are whether the May notice was within thirty days of the time Mrs. Jasins-kas was \u201caware or in the exercise of reasonable diligence should have been aware\u201d of the causal connection between employment and death, and, if not, whether her delay was excusable. We conclude that the record on these issues is sufficiently unclear to require a remand to the AU.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-9\">We remand the case for several reasons. First, since the AU believed that Mrs. Jasinskas, gave timely notice, he did not consider another provision of the Act, 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 912(d)(2), that might have justified granting her benefits despite her lateness. This section allows the AU to excuse a failure to give proper notice - \u201con the ground that for some satisfactory reason such notice could not be given ____\u201d <em>Id. </em>Considering the petitioner\u2019s age, her language difficulties (suggested by the record transcript), the causes listed- on the death certificate, and the fact that the record <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>indicates that the television program made her aware only that asbestos \u201cis a poison,\u201d not that it could lead to heart failure, the AU might have decided that there was such reason here \u2014 particularly since the additional two or three months\u2019 delay does not appear to have prejudiced Bethlehem. <em>See Smith v. Aerojet-General Shipyards, Inc., </em>647 F.2d 518, 525 (5th Cir.1981); <em>Bethlehem Steel Co. v. Parker, </em>163 F.2d 334, 336 (4th Cir.1947).</p>\n<p id=\"b101-4\">The Review Board did not properly consider this issue. It decided simply to reverse, rather than remand, because the petitioner \u201cwas aware of the employer\u2019s identity ... [and] the administrative law judge [did not] state any other basis for excusing claimant\u2019s failure to give timely notice.\u201d This is not surprising, for the AU believed that the May 4 notice was adequate. In other situations where the Board has found the AU\u2019s findings on excuse unclear, it has remanded for further consideration. <em>Owens v. Newport News Shipbuilding &amp; Dry Dock Co., </em>11 B.R.B.S. 409, 417-18 (1979); <em>Mattox v. Sun Shipbuilding &amp; Dry Dock Co., </em>11 B.R.B.S. 333, 336-39 (1979). We do not see how it can do less when the AU made no findings at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">Allowing the Board to decide this issue as it did here would effectively permit it to make findings of fact itself. The Review Board, however, unlike most other agency appeal boards, does not possess \u201call the powers which [the agency] would have in making the original decision ____\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 557(b). Rather, in this area, it inherits the review powers previously possessed by district courts when they examined the findings of Labor Department Deputy Commissioners (now AUs). <em>Presley v. Tinsley Maintenance Service, </em>529 F.2d 433, 436 (5th Cir.1976). Those review powers are limited by statute, 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 921(b)(3) (AU\u2019s \u201cfindings of fact ... shall be conclusive if supported by substantial evidence\u201d), and by ease law, <em>Director, Office of Workers\u2019 Compensation Programs v. Cargill, Inc., </em>718 F.2d 886, 888 (9th Cir.1983) (only AU, not Board, may make findings of fact); <em>Director, Office of Workers\u2019 Compensation Programs v. Newport News Shipbuilding &amp; Dry Dock Co., </em>676 F.2d 110,115 (4th Cir.1982) (same); <em>see O\u2019Keefe v. Smith, Hinchman &amp; Grylls Associates, Inc., </em>380 U.S. 359, 362, 85 S.Ct. 1012, 1014, 13 L.Ed.2d 895 (1965) (per cu-riam) (\u201c[Inferences drawn by the [AU] are'to be accepted unless they are irrational or \u2018unsupported by substantial evidence ----\u2019\u201d) (quoting <em>O\u2019Leary v. Brown-Pacific-Maxon, Inc., </em>340 U.S. 504, 508, 71 S.Ct. 470, 472, 95 L.Ed. 483 (1951)).</p>\n<p id=\"b101-12\">The Review Board, in fact, has disclaimed the power to make findings of fact itself in circumstances like this one. <em>Owens v. Newport News Shipbuilding &amp; Dry Dock Co., </em>11 B.R.B.S. at 418 (\u201c[Although we could perhaps review the record on our own and make the appropriate findings ..., we would be engaging in an initial finding of fact, contrary to our standard of review.\u201d). Consequently, we owe special respect, not to the fact-finding of the Review Board, but to the fact-finding of the AU (as, for example, the Supreme Court typically defers to the fact-finding of the district court, not a reviewing appellate court, <em>see, e.g., Pullman-Standard v. Swint, </em>456 U.S. 273, 285-93, 102 S.Ct. 1781, 1788-92, 72 L.Ed.2d 66 (1982)). In similar situations when the AU has made no findings on excuse, other courts have remanded with instructions to secure such findings. <em>Sun Shipbuilding &amp; Dry Dock Co. v. Walker, </em>590 F.2d 73, 77 (3d Cir.1978); <em>Bartges v. Woodworth, </em>452 F.2d 1383 (D.C.Cir.1971); <em>accord Director, Office of Workers\u2019 Compensation Programs v. Cargill, Inc., </em>718 F.2d at 888; <em>Director, Office of Workers\u2019 Compensation Programs v. Newport News Shipbuilding &amp; Dry Dock Co., </em>676 F.2d at 115. We do the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-13\">A second reason supporting remand to the AU in this case is that the AU\u2019s decision as to notice, read in light of the record, is unclear. The AU wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b101-14\">[Mrs. Jasinskas\u2019s] testimony with respect to her filing of a claim for death benefits was not particularly clear although I am inclined to give her the benefit of the doubt. She testified that she filed after <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>seeing a television program which indicated that \u201casbestosis is a poison,\u201d thus indicating that at that time she became aware of the fact that asbestosis contributed to her husband\u2019s death. Although her testimony could also have been construed to indicate that the television program apprised her of her legal right to file a claim, resolving doubts in her favor, I conclude that she has a valid claim for death benefits as it is not barred by the statute of limitations.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b102-4\">The Review Board noted that the AU \u201cdid not specify why he found that claimant had been given timely notice.\u201d Rather than remand, however, it canvassed the record itself to see if substantial evidence supported this finding. Relying exclusively on the AU\u2019s statement that Mrs. Jasinskas\u2019s testimony \u201cindicated\u201d that she became aware that asbestos contributed to her husband\u2019s death when she saw the television program and on her own uncontradicted testimony that she had seen the program several months before filing her claim, the Board reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">We believe, in light of the Review Board\u2019s limited powers to review AU fact-finding, that it should have remanded the-case, not reversed it. The record does not <em>compel </em>a finding of \u201cawareness\u201d of the causal connection. In fact, the major difficulty with the AU\u2019s opinion is, as the Board noted, that it does not properly provide the \u201creasons or basis\u201d for its legal conclusion. <em>See </em>5 U.S.C. \u00a7 557(c)(3)(A). Why did the AU believe that Mrs. Jasins-kas\u2019s notice was timely? The AU could simply have made a mistake of law. He could have thought that although Mrs. Ja-sinskas became \u201caware\u201d of the causal connection when she saw the television program, the relevant event occurred later when she became aware that she had a legal claim. This is one natural reading of the AU\u2019s opinion. Mrs. Jasinskas\u2019s words, in fact, support this interpretation. When asked by her own counsel \u201cWhen did you first became aware of the fact that you might have a claim against Bethlehem Steel?\u201d, she answered, \u201cWhen they put on television \u2014 I didn\u2019t know nothing. I never made a claim until I saw on the television that it is a poison. That is the time I put the claim.\u201d Yet, the Board did not explicitly adopt this reading of the opinion. And the record makes us uncertain that the AU simply made what in context would have appeared a very obvious mistake. The words of the statute are clear; they speak of the time the beneficiary learned of \u201ca relationship between the ... death and the employment.\" The AU was familiar with the statute and with this language in particular. Moreover, the parties focused his attention on the correct legal question \u2014 the question of causal relationship.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-7\">Another basis for the AU\u2019s finding is possible: namely, that although Mrs. Ja-sinskas\u2019s words \u201cindicated\u201d that the television program told her about the causal connection, her legal rights, or both, \u201cresolving doubts in her favor,\u201d the AU concluded that she meant neither. Mrs. Ja-sinskas\u2019s lack of education and apparent difficulty with English made her testimony often garbled and inconsistent. For instance, she testified that she \u201cput the claim\u201d when she saw the program on television. She apparently telescoped the critical three months between her viewing the program in January or February 1978 and her filing of the claim in May 1978. Consider also the following interchange with her counsel:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-8\">Q. When w\u00e9re you first aware of the fact that [your husband\u2019s] death ... was causally or might be causally related to his asbestos exposure at Bethlehem Steel?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-9\">A. When the doctor told me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-10\">Q. The doctor [who] told you he had asbestosis.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-11\">A. That is right.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b102-12\">The AU considered this interchange insufficient to show an awareness of the causal connection two years before Mr. Jasinskas died, because in context the words did not mean what they seemed to say. He may also have considered the exchange about the television program insufficient to show such awareness. Indeed, the AU would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>have had adequate basis for considering either interchange insufficient to show the requisite \"awareness.\" After all, the requisite causal connection is one between \"asbestosis\" and death through heart disease. One might, for example, reasonably believe that a television program about asbestosis could fail to mention this possible consequence or mention it only to the point where a vague suspicion would be aroused in the mind of the viewer. See Fulks v. Avondale Shipyards, Inc., 10 B.R.B.S. 340, 347 (1980) (generalized suspicions unsupported by medical interpretations do not establish sufficient \"awareness\" to set limitations period i~unning when condition involves complex medical causality), affd, 637 F.2d 1008 (5th Cir.1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b103-21\">The briefs before the AU indicate that the parties did not argue the notice issue in much detail. Rather, they focused on the issue of the causal connection between Mr. Jasinskas's employment and his death. At the outset, in fact, Bethlehem's counsel told the ALT, \"[w]e particularly raise the failure of prompt notice in this case but the most salient defense will be the causal relationship.\" Thus, the parties and the ALl might also have devoted less than requisite care to the question.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-33\">Still, we do not believe it appropriate to parse the language too finely. We simply conclude that the ALT's ~pinion and the record are too unclear to interpret with any certainty. This is not sufficient for review, Atchison. T. &amp; S.F. Ry. v. Wichita Board of Trade, 412 U.S. 800, 807, 93 S.Ct. 2367, 2374, 37 L.Ed.2d 350 (1973) (\"We must know what a[n agency's] decision means before the duty becomes ours to say whether it is right or wrong.\") (quoting United States v. Chicago, M., St. P. &amp; P. Ry., 294 U.S. 499, 511, 55 S.Ct. 462, 467, 79 L.Ed. 1023 (1935)); SEC v. Chenery Corp., 318 U.S. 80, 94, 63 S.Ct. 454, 462, 87 L.Ed. 626 (1943) (\"the grounds upon which the administrative agency acted [must] be clearly disclosed\") (emphasis added), either by us or the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-52\">Under these circumstances we must remand. Although two issues-\"awareness\" and the latter need not be addressed if the former is resolved ably to the petitioner. Moreover, although the \"excuse\" issue will require an tiary hearing, resolution of the ness\" issue may be, achieved simply by requesting clarifying findings and sions from the AU on the existing record. The precise procedures and their sequence are more appropriately determined by the Board. The Board's order is vacated</p>\n<p id=\"b103-65\">The Board's order is vacatedand the case is remanded to the Board with structions to order further proceedings with this opinion.
