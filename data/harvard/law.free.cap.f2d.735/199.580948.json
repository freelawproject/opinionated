(the Company) refused to recognize and bargain with the Cleveland Typographical Union No. 53, International Typographical Union, AFL-CIO (the Union) *n violation of \u00a7\u00a7 8(a)(5) and (1) of the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA). On aPPeal&gt; the comPany contends that this Court sh\u00b0uld deny enforcement because the Board erroneously included within the employees\u2019 bargaining group sports editor, Steve Dungjen. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"AQd\">The Company publishes a daily newspa-. per which serves the area surrounding Medina, Ohio. General Manager Stuart Borden supervises the entire operation, while Managing Editor David McCoy supervises the editors and the photographers. The editorial operation is divided into four sections. The sports section houses three workers, sports editor Dungjen, Assistant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>sports editor Betty Slaybaugh and sports writer Mike Klimko.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-4\">As sports editor, Dungjen was responsible for preparing the sports' page by creating assignments, allocating them to Slay-baugh and Klimko and editing their work. He also maintained and entered the time cards of the employees in the sports department.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">On one occasion, Dungjen effectively recommended to Managing Editor McCoy that employee Klimko not receive full payment for a day\u2019s work. Klimko submitted hours on his time card that reflected work that should have been performed earlier. McCoy without independent investigation or additional advice reduced Klimko\u2019s wages. Dungjen also gave the employees in the sports department verbal criticism.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-6\">He performs a nearly identical role with respect to the freelance reporters and the photographers. He recruits them, gives them assignments, edits their work, accounts for their time and gives them criticism.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-7\">On November 17, 1980, the Union filed a representative petition with the Board, seeking certification as the bargaining representative of the Company\u2019s employees. At a representation hearing, the company contended that Dungjen should not be included as an employee within the bargaining unit because he is a supervisor. On March 31, 1981, however, the Regional Director concluded that employee Dungjen should be included within the bargaining unit and directed an election. Th\u00e9 Board denied the Company's request for review of its conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-8\">On May 7 and 8, the Board conducted a secret ballot election. The Union received 38 votes in favor of representation and 37 votes opposed to representation. Three ballots were challenged and the Company filed timely objections to the election. The Regional Director conducted an investigation into and heard testimony on the Company\u2019s election. The Director then issued a decision in which he overruled all of the Company\u2019s objections and certified the Union as the collective bargaining representative of the unit employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-9\">On June 28, 1982, the Union filed unfair labor practice charges against the Company for its refusal to bargain with the Union in violation of \u00a7\u00a7 8(a)(5) and (1) of the NLRA. The Company admitted its refusal to bargain, but contended that the Union was not properly certified. On September 15, 1982, the Board issued its order finding the Company in violation of \u00a7\u00a7 8(a)(1) and (5) and ordered the Company to bargain with the Union. The Board now petitions for enforcement of its order.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-10\">In reviewing this petition for enforcement, we \u201caccord great respect to the expertise of the Board when its conclusions are rationally based on articulated facts and consistent with the Act.\u201d <em>NLRB v. Yeshiva University, </em>444 U.S. 672, 691, 100 S.Ct. 856, 867, 63 L.Ed.2d 115 (1980); citing <em>Beth Israel Hospital v. NLRB, </em>437 U.S. 483, 501, 98 S.Ct. 2463, 2473, 57 L.Ed.2d 370 (1978). We must determine whether the Board\u2019s conclusion that Dungjen was an \u201cemployee\u201d rather than a \u201csupervisor\u201d is as a matter of law consistent with the NLRA. .</p>\n<p id=\"b298-11\">Section 2(11) of the Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 152(11), defines \u201csupervisor\u201d as one</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A2i\">having authority in the interest of the employer, to hire, transfer, suspend, layoff, recall, promote, discharge, assign, reward, or discipline other employees or responsibility to direct them, or to adjust their grievances or effectively to recommend such action, if in connection with the foregoing the exercise of such authority is not of a merely routine or clerical nature, but requires the use of independent judgment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b298-12\">In <em>NLRB v. Wilson-Crissman, Inc., </em>659 F.2d 728 (6th Cir.1981), this Court recognized that these indicia of supervisory status are disjunctive. \u201cThe exercise of any one of the enumerated powers combined with \u2018independent business judgment,\u2019 \u201d we held in that case, \u201cis enough to make one a supervisor.\u201d 659 F.2d at 729; citing <em>Walla Walla Union Bulletin v. NLRB, </em>631 F.2d 609, 613 (9th Cir.1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b298-13\">In the case currently before this Court, the Board explicitly found that Dungjen <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>actually exercised one of the enumerated supervisory powers. According to the Board, \u201cDungjen effectively recommended on one occasion that employee Klimko not be paid for hours spent on work that he (Dungjen) believed should have already been completed.\u201d That effective recommendation was a clear manifestation of Dungjen\u2019s supervisory status. The Board made no finding as to whether the exercise of such supervisory authority required \u201cthe use of independent judgment\u201d. In the absence of any finding, we must consider the record before us to determine whether Dungjen\u2019s decision to discipline Klimko required independent judgment. Dungjen\u2019s decision was the product of his assessment of Klimko\u2019s past performance, his understanding of the nature of the work assigned, his consideration of the timing of completion, his awareness of Klimko\u2019s role among all of the sports writers and his balance of alternative disciplinary measures. Managing Editor McCoy moreover adopted Dungjen\u2019s decision without investigation or additional consultation. The recommendation of discipline in this case therefore required Dungjen\u2019s \u201cindependent judgment.\u201d We conclude that such judgment, coupled with the authority to exercise one of the enumerated supervisory powers, establishes Dungjen as a \u201csupervisor\u201d under \u00a7 152(11).</p>\n<p id=\"b299-4\">In its Order, the Board reasons that \u201cthis single incident\u201d of discipline was \u201ctoo isolated to establish Dungjen\u2019s status as a supervisor.\u201d The Board\u2019s reasoning however is, as a matter of Sixth Circuit law, erroneous. In <em>Ohio Power Co. v. NLRB, </em>176 F.2d 385, 388 (6th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>338 U.S. 899, 70 S.Ct. 249, 94 L.Ed. 553 (1949), this Court held that supervisory status \u201cdoes not require the exercise of power described for all or any definite part of the employee\u2019s time.\u201d <em>See also Federal Compress &amp; Warehouse Co. v. NLRB, </em>398 F.2d 631 (6th Cir.1968). In <em>Federal Compress, </em>we reiterated that the employee is not required</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-5\">regularly and routinely to exercise the powers set forth in the statute. It is the existence of the power which determines whether an employee is a supervisor. 398 F.2d at 634; citing <em>Ohio Power, </em>176 F.2d. at 388. Hence in <em>Ohio Power </em>this Court concluded that the Board \u201cerred as a matter of law in considering the test of supervisory duties to be the frequency of their existence.\u201d 176 F.2d at 388. In the case before us, as well, the Board erred as a matter of law in finding that Dungjen could not be a supervisor on the basis of his infrequent or isolated exercise of supervisory power. The well-settled law in this Circuit requires the legal conclusion that Dungjen is \u00e1 \u201csupervisor\u201d within the Act\u2019s definition. Because we conclude that the Board erred as a matter of law in including Dungjen as an employee within the bargaining unit, we are unable to enforce its order.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b299-10\">Accordingly, the Petition for Enforcement is hereby Denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
