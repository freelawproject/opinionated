After an airline official left word with the answering service at that telephone number, a man identifying himself as Freedman<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> telephoned the airline and told them the package would be picked up that day. Freedman had the W.R. Zanes Warehouse pick up and store the package. He then telephoned Suburban Delivery Company to arrange for collection of the package from the Zanes Warehouse. Lawrence Lopez, a driver for Suburban Delivery, was sent by his dispatcher to the parking lot of a Denny\u2019s restaurant near the warehouse to meet Freedman and receive his instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"820\">*820</page-number>According to Lopez\u2019s trial testimony, he arrived at the parking lot fifteen or twenty minutes early, and waited in his pickup truck with his son for forty-five minutes until a man approached the driver\u2019s side of the truck. Lopez said, \u201cMr. Freedman?,\u201d and the man replied, \u201cYes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b918-4\">Lopez got out of the truck and stood two to three feet from Freedman as they spoke. Freedman paid Lopez in cash for delivery and storage services, instructed him to deliver the package to a Houston address, obtained a receipt, and left. It was early afternoon, shortly after lunchtime.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-5\">Witnesses testified that Lopez then moved his delivery truck to the warehouse, and was followed by a dark Mercedes with two occupants. When Lopez came to a stop, so did the car, parking across the street. The driver got out of the car, walked around to the front and raised the hood, as if to check the engine. However, according to the testimony, the driver never took his eyes off Lopez\u2019s truck. Lopez then moved the delivery van to the rear of the warehouse, and again the car followed, parking within sight of both.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-6\">When Lopez entered the warehouse, he was met by police who informed him that the package contained contraband and that he was \u201cin trouble,\u201d according to Lopez\u2019s testimony. At this point, officers obtained a description of Freedman from Lopez, and the delivery address (which was that of the telephone answering service). They placed Freedman and his companion under arrest, and arranged a line-up for Lopez and his son at the nearby customs office. The sequence of events at the line-up was as follows: first, Lopez entered the line-up room and selected a man who was not Woolery. DEA agent Perry asked Lopez if he was sure, and Lopez stated that he was not. Second, Lopez\u2019s eleven-year-old son who had been with him in the parking lot stepped to the door. Within the hearing of his father, he pointed to the defendant Woolery as the man in the parking lot. Third, an agent then asked Lopez again if he was sure about his selection, and encouraged him to take another look. It was then that Lopez, Sr., selected Woolery as the man he had met in the parking lot who had identified himself as Freedman.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-9\">At trial, Lopez and his son both identified Woolery as the man they had seen in the Denny\u2019s parking lot. Lopez recalled the description he had given the officers that day, stating that the man was five-feet-seven- or five-feet-eight-inches tall, with a beard and mustache, wearing a white shirt, blue jeans, and brown boots. Lopez stated that his in-court identification of Woolery was based both on what he had seen in the line-up and what he recalled from the day in the parking lot.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-10\">The jury found Woolery guilty of the attempted possession with intent to distribute count, and acquitted him of the cocaine importation count. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 846, 841(a)(1), 952. Woolery was sentenced to four years in prison, followed by a special parole term of three years. Woolery is currently free on bond, which was continued on appeal at his sentencing. Woolery filed a timely notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-11\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-12\">Woolery raises two issues on appeal. First, he argues that the line-up identification by Lopez was impermissibly suggestive and resulted in a substantial likelihood of irreparable misidentification. Second, he argues that the evidence was insufficient to support a verdict of attempted possession with intent to distribute. For the reasons set forth below, we find both contentions without merit and affirm his conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-13\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-14\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-15\">Woolery argues that the line-up was im-permissibly suggestive<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> because agents\u2019 conduct suggested that Lopez had made a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"821\">*821</page-number>mistake the first time and should try again. Woolery also maintains that the line-up procedure was unduly coercive in the light of Lopez\u2019s statement on cross-examination that he had been threatened with jail and that he felt that he could \u201cgo free\u201d if he ., -j i-j. . . , ,IT . could identify the right person. Woolery . ,, f , argues further that under <em>Manson </em>v. <em>Brathwaite, </em>432 U.S. 98, 97 S.Ct. 2243, 53 L.Ed.2d 140 (1977), the identification evidence is excludable because it is unreliable, based on the totality of the circumstances, and would result in a substantial likelihood of misidentification.</p>\n<p id=\"ATIr\">Though we agree that the identification procedure was unnecessarily suggestive, we do not feel that its reliability was so impaired as to mandate its exclusion from trial under <em>Manson. </em>Admissibility of ., .... .. .. . . , identification evidence is governed by a A , , . . . , . _ two-step analysis enunciated m <em>Passman </em>v<em>. Blackburn, </em>652 F.2d 559, 569 (5th Cir.1981), cert<em>. denied, </em>455 U.S. 1022, 102 S<em>.</em>Ct. 1722, 72 L.Ed.2d 141 (1982). The first step . ^ \u2019 , . . ' <em>' ., </em>J <em>1 </em>is to determine whether the identification . . .... procedure was impermissibly suggestive. fl, , . / . t , The encouragement by agents for Lopez to , ,, , , . .. . take another look and see if you can be \u201e ,, . . ., . , sure came on the heels of his son s selec- .. \u201e,, . . . , . . tion of the defendant within the hearing of T , .. . ....

The second step of the <em>Manson </em>analysis requires inquiry into:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Acq-\">whether under the totality of the circumstances the suggestiveness leads to a substantial likelihood of irreparable mis-identification ____ Under this analysis \u201creliability is the linchpin in determining the admissibility of identification testimony.\u201d <em>Manson v. Brathwaite, </em>432 U.S. 98, 114, 97 S.Ct. 2243, 2253, 53 L.Ed.2d 140 (1977). Thus, an identification found to be reliable will be admitted even though the confrontation procedure was suggestive.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AT1g\"><em>Passman v. Blackburn, </em>652 F.2d at 569.</p>\n<p id=\"AqUO\">Six factors have been identified m . .. . , ,. ,, . , \u201e this circuit for evaluating the risk of mis- \u2022, ,... ,. . ,. , <em>Tr </em>identification. According to <em>United States v.

Lopez where to leave the package, and ... . , ^ .... , obtain a receipt. Conditions here were su- , ,, . , ,, ., penor to those m <em>Manson, </em>where the wit- , , ,, , ness saw the defendant through an open , . , . , ,, . , doorway as he stood m a hallway illummat- , , , , <em>TJ a , </em>i ed by natural light. 432 U.S. at 100-1, 97 <em>0 n. </em>, 00,, ,, ,. ... , S.Ct. at 2246. (2) At the time of the meet- . . ,, , . , , T , mg m the parking lot, Lopez had no reason , \u201e , to see Freedman as anything but another client. Thus, his attention was probably not particularly focused, compared to, say, the attention of the bank teller being robbed in <em>Atkins. </em>(3) Lopez\u2019s description was detailed and came minutes after his meeting with \u201cFreedman\u201d in the parking lot. The photograph of the line-up reveals the description was accurate, both as to facial hair and clothing. (4) Lopez was uncertain at the first viewing of the line-up. The man he chose the first time closely resembled the defendant as to height, facial hair, and hairline. The defendant was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"822\">*822</page-number>standing the farthest away from the witness in the office where the line-up took place. Lopez exhibited certainty at trial that Woolery was the man he had seen in the parking lot. (5) The line-up took place the afternoon of the meeting and arrest. \u201cWe do not have here the passage of weeks or months between the crime and the viewing\u201d of the line-up. <em>Manson, </em>432 U.S. at 116, 97 S.Ct. at 2253-4. (6) It is difficult to assess the corrupting influence of the suggestive identification, since Lopez admitted that his in-court identification was a product of both the line-up and the initial meeting. However, at trial, Lopez explicitly identified Woolery as the man he had \u201cmet at Denny\u2019s and who acknowledged that he was Richard Freedman.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b920-4\">Under the \u201ctotality of the circumstances\u201d test, there is ample basis for concluding that the identification was a reliable one. We cannot say there was a very substantial risk of irreparable misidentifi-cation, a necessary element of a due process violation. <em>See Stovall v. Denno, </em>388 U.S. 293, 87 S.Ct. 1967, 1972, 18 L.Ed.2d 1199 (1967). Therefore, the district court properly admitted the identification testimony of Lopez.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-6\">Woolery\u2019s second contention on appeal is that the evidence was insufficient to sustain the conviction for attempted possession with intent to distribute under the sufficiency of the evidence standard of <em>United States v. Bell, </em>678 F.2d 547, 549 (5th Cir.1982) (en banc). Woolery\u2019s argument hinges largely on his contention that \u201cat no time did the Defendant Woolery ever state that he was \u2018Mr. Freedman,\u2019 \u201d thus no connection was established between Woolery and the contraband, and its ultimate destination. Therefore, \u201ca reasonable trier of fact\u201d could not conclude that Woolery was guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-7\">Woolery\u2019s argument must fail, particularly in the light of Lopez\u2019s testimony that the defendant answered affirmatively to the inquiry, \u201cMr. Freedman?\u201d <em>Bell </em>does not require that \u201cthe evidence exclude every reasonable hypothesis of innocence or be wholly inconsistent with every conclusion except guilt, provided a reasonable trier of fact could find guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>United States v. Bell, </em>678 F.2d at 549; <em>United States v. Sneed, </em>705 F.2d 745, 749 (5th Cir.1983) (citations omitted). Viewing the evidence most favorably to the government, <em>United States v. Chanya, </em>700 F.2d 192, 195 (5th Cir.1983), we conclude that a reasonable trier of fact could find that Woolery attempted to possess the cocaine with intent to distribute it. As this court stated in its earlier opinion, finding probable cause to arrest Woolery, the agents \u201cwitnessed the suspect engaging in activity centering on known contraband, activity that had no legitimate or logical explanation.\u201d <em>United States v. Woolery, </em>670 F.2d 513, 516 (5th Cir.1982) (reversed district court\u2019s order granting motion to suppress evidence obtained after illegal arrest).</p>\n<p id=\"b920-9\">Similarly, Woolery\u2019s contention that his actions did not constitute a criminal attempt under <em>United States v. Mandujano, </em>499 F.2d 370, 376 (5th Cir.1974), is without merit. <em>Mandujano </em>requires that the defendant have engaged in conduct \u201cwhich constitutes a substantial step toward commission of the crime\u201d before an attempt conviction is allowed to stand. <em>United States v. Mandujano, </em>499 F.2d at 376. In other words, \u201cmere preparation\u201d for criminal activity is not sufficient to sustain an attempt conviction. <em>See United States v. Oviedo, </em>525 F.2d 881, 885 (5th Cir.1976). On these facts, Woolery\u2019s involvement in the delivery of the cocaine to its ultimate destination took him beyond \u201cmere preparation.\u201d The goal in <em>Oviedo </em>is that objective acts of the defendant without regard to <em>mens rea </em>\u201cmark the defendant\u2019s conduct as criminal in nature. The acts should be unique rather than so commonplace that they are engaged in by persons not in violation of the law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Only then may an attempt conviction stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-10\">Here, use of two delivery services, use of answering machines, and the conspicuous <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"823\">*823</page-number>surveillance by Woolery and his companion of Lopez\u2019s delivery truck constitute precisely the type of \u201cobjective acts\u201d which mark Woolery\u2019s conduct as criminal in nature, and evidence \u201ccommitment to the criminal venture and corroborate the mens rea.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"A_4a\">HI.</p>\n<p id=\"AABr\">The conviction of one count of attempted possession with intent to distribute is</p>\n<p id=\"ApJ3\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b917-14\">. A more detailed recitation of the facts appears in <em>United States v. Woolery, </em>670 F.2d 513, 514-5 (5th Cir.1982) (reversal of order granting defendant\u2019s motion to suppress evidence obtained after illegal arrest).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b917-15\">. Though a voice print analysis showed that the person who telephoned was not Woolery, the man who met Lopez in the parking lot was Woolery, although he responded to the name of \"Richard Freedman.\u201d In setting forth the facts, the name \"Freedman\u201d will be used to refer to Woolery when he used the alias for the meeting with Lopez. Elsewhere, Woolery is Woolery.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b918-7\">. Woolery argued for suppression of the identification prior to trial and during the trial. His pre-trial motion to suppress on this basis was denied, and his attempts to have the identification excluded during trial were unsuccessful.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
