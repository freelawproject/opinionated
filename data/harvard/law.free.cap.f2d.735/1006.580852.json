JONES, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"A-RT\">This case is currently before the Court upon the consolidated appeals of Homer and Jobn f\u00b0skins fr\u00b0m their jury convic\u00dc\u00b0ns for the manufacture and possession of \u201c^uaif wkhfhemtentto dis nbute m \u2122lal0n of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1). Upon mitia1 consideration, this Court ordered ^ \u201dstant actl0nbe beld m abeyance <em>fn\u00e1in% </em>the Supreme Court s review of our Oliver v. United States, 686 F.2d 356 (6th Cir.1982). In light of the Supreme Courts disposition of <em>Oliver, </em>we are now comPelled to affirm appellants convic 10ns*</p>\n<p id=\"akd-dedup-2\">The facts relevant to this appeal are largely uncontroverted. Acting on a tip from an anonymous informant, the Kentucky state police flew over appellants\u2019 property searching for marijuana plants. On July 31, 1981, the police spotted what they believed to be a marijuana patch. On August 4, 1981, several members of the state police and a german shepard travelled over a mountain and through a hollow toward the rear of the Hoskins\u2019 property. A private road in front of the property con-turned a posted, but overgrown no-trespassing sign.</p>\n<p id=\"AvRu\">The officers passed by the sign on to the Hoskins\u2019 property. They approached John Hoskins, who informed them that he owned the property and allowed them to search the area. He stated that he believed that one of the officers, Detective Loomis, knew the contours of his property. The officers <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1007\">*1007</page-number>also approached Homer Hoskins, who gave them permission to search for marijuana and assisted them in finding the illicit crop.</p>\n<p id=\"b1105-5\">The officers found a large marijuana plot, located about one-hundred yards from John Hoskins\u2019 house. The patch was not visible from the public road, but could be seen by any one approaching the Hoskins\u2019 homes. Federal agents, acting without a warrant, seized approximately two-thousand marijuana plants from appellants\u2019 land.</p>\n<p id=\"b1105-6\">After they were indicted for violating 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1), appellants moved to suppress the evidence of marijuana. The district court denied that motion. Appellants were then convicted by a jury of manufacturing and possessing marijuana with the intent to distribute. Appellant\u2019s sole contention on appeal is that the agents\u2019 war-rantless search and seizure of marijuana plants on their land violated the Fourth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1105-7\">We now are forced to reject that contention in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Oliver, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 104 S.Ct. 1735, 80 L.Ed. 214 (1984). In <em>Oliver </em>two officers of the Kentucky State Police Department, acting on tips that marijuana was growing on petitioner\u2019s farm, walked toward the suspect field, passed a locked gate with a \u201cNo Trespassing Sign\u201d, ignored verbal warnings and found incriminating marijuana plants. The Supreme Court adopted this Court\u2019s analysis in <em>Oliver </em>and held \u201cthat the government\u2019s intrusion upon the open fields is not one of those \u2018unreasonable searches,\u2019 proscribed by the text of the Fourth Amendment.\u201d Relying upon <em>Katz v. United States, </em>389 U.S. 347, 88 S.Ct. 507, 19 L.Ed.2d 576 (1967), the Court found no \u201creasonable expectation of privacy\u201d in open fields which are not \u201csurrounding and associated with the home.\u201d \u2014 U.S. at -, 104 S.Ct. at 1740. Although the Supreme Court has often in past cases expanded the plain meaning of the Fourth Amendment\u2019s protection of persons, houses, papers and effects to include, for example, a public telephone booth and a public conversation, <em>see Katz, </em>389 U.S. at 347, 88 S.Ct. at 507, and has exempted from its current holding \u201ccurtileges,\u201d <em>see Oliver, </em>\u2014 U.S. at -, 104 S.Ct. at 1742, the Court decided in this particular case to restrict the Amendment\u2019s scope to those items explicitly mentioned. An open field, the Court stated, is not mentioned in and therefore not protected by the Fourth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1105-14\">In addition, according to <em>Oliver, </em>society apparently is no longer prepared to recognize as \u201creasonable,\u201d <em>see Katz, </em>389 U.S. at 361, 88 S.Ct. at 516 (Harlan, J. concurring), any privacy interest in some parts of a landowner\u2019s property. Over a vigorous dissent which argued that the expectation of privacy in one\u2019s property is rooted deeply in (1) positive law, citing <em>Rakas v. Illinois, </em>439 U.S. at 153, 99 S.Ct. at 435 (2) the private manner in which such property is used, citing <em>Rakas, </em>439 U.S. 128, 153, 99 S.Ct. 421, 435, 58 L.Ed.2d 387 (1978) (Powell, J. concurring); <em>United States v. Chadwick, </em>433 U.S. at 1, 13, 97 S.Ct. 2476, 2484, 53 L.Ed.2d 538 (1977) and (3) the owner\u2019s manifestation of the privacy of that property, citing <em>Rawlings v. Kentucky, </em>448 U.S. 98, 100 S.Ct. 2556, 65 L.Ed.2d 633 (1980), the Court decided that individuals in this country can now only expect privacy in an area \u201cadjacent to the home.\u201d \u2014 U.S. at -, 104 S.Ct. at 1742.</p>\n<p id=\"b1105-15\"><em>Oliver </em>forces us to conclude, therefore, that the Fourth Amendment does not protect fields which are open and not adjacent to an otherwise protected area. Hence, the Hoskins\u2019 reliance upon the Fourth Amendment on appeal from their jury convictions for violating \u00a7 841(a)(1) is, at this moment in the Supreme Court\u2019s understanding of that Amendment\u2019s protections, misplaced. The facts of the case before us fall within the sweep of <em>Oliver\u2019s </em>language. As in <em>Oliver, </em>law enforcement authorities entered the Hoskins\u2019 land, passed an overgrown \u201cno trespass\u201d sign and discovered marijuana in a field which was open and not in any way \u201cadjacent\u201d to an area protected by the Fourth Amendment. <em>See Oliver, </em>\u2014 U.S. at -, 104 S.Ct. at 1742. Because the agents discovered marijuana <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1008\">*1008</page-number>in a field, both open and non-adjaeent to an area in which the Hoskins have a reasonable expectation of privacy, their search for and seizure of that evidence, we are compelled to find, is not prohibited by the Fourth Amendment. We conclude, therefore, that the district court properly denied the Hoskins\u2019 motion to suppress the evidence seized pursuant to <em>Oliver\u2019s </em>\u201copen fields\u201d exception to the Fourth Amendment\u2019s warrant requirement. Accordingly the district court\u2019s judgments are hereby Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b1106-4\">NICHOLS, Senior Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"a-n-dedup-0\">concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b1106-5\">I concur in the judgment and in the reasons given except I would not use the words \u201ccompelled\u201d or \u201cforced\u201d to describe the impact of the Supreme Court\u2019s <em>Oliver </em>decision upon my thinking. \u201cLed\u201d would be more to my taste. It is not true that but for our highest tribunal having spoken, I would have gone the opposite way. Actually, there was an important difference in the cases. The possibility of marijuana plantations being detected from the air was a mere speculation in <em>Oliver, </em>yet is referred to there as tending to undermine the reasonableness of the grower expecting privacy in his illicit activity, even though in fact such surveillance did not occur. In this case it did occur and was the origin of the enforcement officer\u2019s suspicions. What was seen from the air would, I should think, have afforded probable cause if a warrant had been applied for. By modern aviation law, as I understand it, aircraft are free to come and go at over 500 feet without trespass upon the rights of the surface landowner. There was no suggestion the enforcement officers used or needed any kind of unusual or sophisticated equipment to detect the marijuana. There is nothing clandestine or secret about a helicopter thundering overhead.</p>\n<p id=\"b1106-6\">I would have held, therefore, that the marijuana was in \u201cplain view,\u201d just as if it could have been seen from the highway and one who places an article in such plain view has no reasonable expectation that it will not be seen. I would have thought, though <em>Oliver </em>was decided by divided tribunals, both in this and in the Supreme Court, some of the dissenters in either place might reasonably have been persuaded by the factual differences in this case. It was the major premise of both dissents that <em>Oliver, </em>by \u201cno trespassing\u201d signs, locked gates, etc., did what he could to assure privacy, and presumably the result would have been different, in the eyes of dissenters, had he not done so. The defendants here did nothing to keep helicopters away, and nothing to conceal what might have been seen from them, the plantation being wide-open to aerial view. The marijuana plant is distinctive. Once one is seen, others are readily recognized.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
