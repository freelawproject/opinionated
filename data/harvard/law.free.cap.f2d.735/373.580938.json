We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-13\">The trial judge\u2019s instruction on the intent necessary to convict for both offenses was not erroneous. Unlike the instructions struck down in <em>Sandstrom v. Montana, </em>442 U.S. 510, 99 S.Ct. 2450, 61 L.Ed.2d 39 (1979), and <em>Connecticut v. Johnson, </em>460 U.S. 73, 103 S.Ct. 969, 74 L.Ed.2d 823 (1983), the instruction in this case could not have been understood by a reasonable juror as stating a binding presumption of criminal intent. The instruction was phrased in permissive terms: \u201cYou <em>may consider it reasonable </em>to draw the inference and find that a person intends the natural and probable consequences of acts knowingly done.\u201d (Emphasis added.) It included the disclaimer that, \u201cit is entirely up to you to decide what the facts are from the evidence in the case.\u201d We upheld an almost identical instruction in <em>United States v. Ross, </em>626 F.2d 77, 79-80 (9th Cir.1980), decided after <em>Sandstrom.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b472-15\">Johnson attacks 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1544, as implemented by the restrictions contained in his passport, as unconstitutionally vague. The statute prohibits the willful and knowing use of \u201cany passport in violation of the conditions or restrictions therein contained.\u201d Johnson\u2019s passport stated that \u201c[a]ny use ... for travel other than that incidental to the discharge of the bearer\u2019s ... diplomatic mission is prohibited, and punishable under [\u00a7 1544].\u201d The purpose Johnson himself gave for his trip \u2014 the study of Peruvian politics \u2014 had nothing at all to do with the diplomatic mission to which Johnson was assigned when he made the trip \u2014 affairs related to the Atlantic fisheries. \u201cOne to whose conduct a statute clearly applies may not successfully challenge it for vagueness.\u201d <em>Parker v. Levy, </em>417 U.S. 733, 756, 94 S.Ct. 2547, 2562, 41 L.Ed.2d 439 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b472-16\">The slight difference between the language of the indictment and the restriction in Johnson\u2019s passport did not prejudice Johnson. The indictment charged Johnson with \u201cusing the diplomatic passport when he was not abroad on a diplomatic assign-ment____\u201d He had more than adequate notice of the charges against him. <em>United States v. Coleman, </em>656 F.2d 509, 511-12 (9th Cir.1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b472-19\">22 U.S.C. \u00a7 211a gives the Secretary exclusive authority to \u201cgrant and issue passports ... under such rules as the President shall designate____\u201d Executive Order No. 11,295, 3 C.F.R. 570 (1966) empowers the Secretary to prescribe such rules under the President\u2019s authority without action of the President. Thus, Congress has delegated to the Executive Branch the power to prescribe those restrictions that, if violated, constitute an offense under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1544. The federal courts have long recognized the validity of such a delegation. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Curtiss-Wright Export Corp., </em>299 U.S. 304, 321-22, 57 S.Ct. 216, 221-222, 81 L.Ed. 255 (1936); <em>Avent v. United States, </em>266 U.S. 127, 130-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>31, 45 S.Ct. 34, 35, 69 L.Ed. 202 (1924); <em>McKinley v. United States, </em>249 U.S. 397, 399, 39 S.Ct. 324, 324, 63 L.Ed. 668 (1919); <em>United States v. Grimaud, </em>220 U.S. 506, 521-23, 31 S.Ct. 480, 484-485, 55 L.Ed. 563 (1911).</p>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">Although delegation of authority is not unlimited, the Secretary of State does have broad power to control the use of passports. <em>See Haig v. Agee, </em>453 U.S. 280, 293-94, 101 S.Ct. 2766, 2774-2775, 69 L.Ed.2d 640 (1981); <em>Lynd v. Rusk, </em>389 F.2d 940, 947-48 (D.C.Cir.1967). At a minimum, he has the authority to impose restrictions on employees of his own department. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 301 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b473-7\">The head of an Executive department ... may prescribe regulations for the government of his department, the conduct of its employees, the distribution and performance of its business, and the custody, use, and preservation of its records, papers, and property.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b473-8\"><em>See Chrysler Corp. v. Brown, </em>441 U.S. 281, 309, 99 S.Ct. 1705, 1721, 60 L.Ed.2d 208 (1979); H.R.Rep. No. 1461, 85th Cong., 2d Sess. 1 (1958); 19 Op. Att\u2019y Gen. 401, 403 (1889). On these facts, the Secretary acted within his power in imposing the restrictions on the use of a diplomatic passport violated by appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
