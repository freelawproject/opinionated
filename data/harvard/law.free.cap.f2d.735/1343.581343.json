SMITH, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b1442-9\">In this pre-award, post-suspension Government contracts case, appellant ATL, Inc. (ATL), appeals from a decision of the United States Claims Court dismissing, for lack of jurisdiction, ATL\u2019s suit to enjoin temporarily the award of two Army Corps of Engineers (Army) contracts to any bidders other than ATL. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1442-10\">\n<em>Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1442-11\">ATL submitted low bids, which the Army opened in December 1983 and January 1984, on two Army contracts. During this time \u2014 and in fact from July 15, 1983, until beyond the date of ATL\u2019s filing suit in the court below \u2014 ATL has been suspended from receiving any Government contracts. We have recounted the details of this suspension, which the Department of the Navy (Navy) effected, in our opinion on that subject, <em>ATL, Inc. v. United States (ATL I).</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1442-17\">Because of the Navy-initiated suspension, the Army informed ATL by letter dated March 7, 1984, that the Army would not award ATL the two contracts on which it was low bidder. ATL sued in the Claims Court for preliminary injunctive relief pending this court\u2019s decision on the validity of the suspension in <em>ATL I, </em>and for final injunctive relief if ATL prevailed on its appeal here and the Navy lifted the suspension after a new hearing. The Claims Court granted the Government\u2019s motion to dismiss ATL\u2019s complaint for lack of jurisdiction;<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> ATL appeals here.</p>\n<p id=\"b1442-18\">\n<em>Opinion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1442-19\">This case differs from the two recent suspension-related cases we have considered, <em>ATL I </em>and <em>Electro-Methods, Inc.,</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark><em> </em>because, while the suit was filed below <em>before </em>the Government issued the awards, it was filed long <em>after </em>the Government had effected the suspension, as were the bids at issue filed long after that suspension. While mechanistic application of these facts does not per se determine the Claims Court\u2019s jurisdiction, this information is relevant in resolving whether the case is styled a \u201cbid protest\u201d case over which the Claims Court and its predecessor court have long exercised jurisdiction,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> or whether the case constitutes an Administrative Procedure Act challenge to the Government\u2019s suspension action, in which event the case belongs in district court.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1442-20\">ATL contends that its case falls in the bid protest category because the Army <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1345\">*1345</page-number>breached its implied-in-fact contract to consider ATL\u2019s two bids fairly and honestly. In particular, ATL points to the Army\u2019s conduct in soliciting, accepting, opening, listing, publishing as low bids, and requesting extension of, ATL\u2019s two offers, as evidence of such an implied contract. The Claims Court, after a careful discussion of both the law relating to jurisdiction and the elements of an implied-in-fact contract, found such a contract not to exist, because of the statutory prohibition against the Government\u2019s doing business with suspended contractors.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The Government urges that we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1443-5\">We do affirm, for the reasons set forth in the opinion below. Despite apparent conduct to the contrary, the Army lacked actual authority to bind the Government to a contract with ATL as long as the suspension was in place.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> ATL\u2019s assertion that the statutory prohibition is not absolute because the Army must consider a suspended contractor\u2019s bid to determine if it might fall within the statutory \u201ccompelling reason\u201d exception to the prohibition<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> does not apply here. There has been no suggestion from either side that the Government ever considered that there might be a \u201ccompelling reason to solicit an offer from, [or] award a contract to\u201d ATL.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1443-6\">ATL also contends before this court that the statutory prohibition does not apply to ATL because it was not \u201csuspended\u201d according to the definition of that term, which defines \u201csuspend\u201d as being carried out \u201cpursuant to established administrative procedures.\u201d <footnotemark>10</footnotemark> While in <em>ATL I </em>we agreed in part with the court below that the Navy\u2019s suspension proceeding partially denied ATL of due process, such that the Navy must provide ATL with a new hearing, we did not, nor did the Claims Court, revoke or set aside that suspension.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Moreover, the Navy did follow its \u201cestablished administrative procedures,\u201d such as they were, in effectuating the suspension. ATL\u2019s position would require that each contracting officer reexamine and second-guess the propriety of any and every suspended contractor\u2019s suspension proceeding, a wholly impractical result which we reject in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1443-15\">Finally, ATL urges that the 12-month suspension has expired, such that it is now eligible to receive the Army contracts, because the Navy originally de facto suspended ATL in March 1983.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> This theory does not hold up on the facts. The Navy opened the four ATL bids at issue in <em>ATL I </em>in both March and April of 1983; the Navy under normal procedures would have had 60 days to determine whether the low bidder was responsible, or until May and June of 1983; and, most significantly, ATL received an Army contract in June 1983.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> In these circumstances we find no de facto suspension which could be considered to have expired, such that the Army would now be authorized to do business with ATL.</p>\n<p id=\"b1443-16\">We therefore affirm the opinion of the Claims Court, granting the Government\u2019s motion to dismiss ATL\u2019s suit for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1443-17\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1442-12\">. <em>ATL, Inc. v.

Instead, this is a case in which the appellant\u2019s bids were received and considered for a measur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1346\">*1346</page-number>able period of time. ATL submitted the two bids involved here to the Corps of Engineers; these were initially accepted along with others, were opened along with the others in December 1983 and January 1984, and found to be the low bids. Not wishing to make an award on the then due dates of March 16th and 21st, the Corps of Engineers asked and received extensions to March 30, 1984, from ATL and the other bidders. It- was not until March 7th that the Engineers informed ATL that it would not award that company the contracts so long as the Navy suspension lasted. There was, in short, an acceptance of the bids as such, and some consideration of them for a period of time.</p>\n<p id=\"b1444-4\">This was enough, in my view, to invoke the \u201cimplied contract\u201d theory on which the jurisdiction of the Claims Court over preaward contract claims, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1491(a)(1), (3), is said to rest. <em>United States v. John C. Grimberg Co., </em>702 F.2d 1362, 1367 (Fed.Cir.1983); <em>CACI, Inc.-Federal v. United States, </em>719 F.2d 1567, 1572-73 (Fed.Cir.1983); <em>Electro-Methods, Inc. v. United States, </em>728 F.2d 1471, 1475 (Fed.Cir.1984); <em>ATL, Inc. v. United States, </em>736 F.2d 677, 681, 682 (Fed.Cir.1984). Here, that implied contract of fair consideration was not simply an agreement \u201cimplied in law\u201d but, rather, an implied-in-fact contract based on the mutual consensual transactions of both ATL and the Corps of Engineers. The Claims Court therefore had jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1444-5\">The majority holds that that conclusion is thwarted by 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 2393 (1982), prohibiting the Government\u2019s doing business with suspended contractors and bidders. Unlike the court, I reject that position because \u00a7 2393 expressly defines \u201csuspend\u201d (for contract purposes) to mean \u201cto disqualify, <em>pursuant to established administrative procedures\u201d </em>(emphasis added). 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2393(c)(2). We have already held in <em>ATL I, supra, </em>that the Navy\u2019s suspension of ATL did <em>not </em>occur \u201cpursuant to established administrative procedures\u201d, in the only sense in which Congress can have used that phrase, <em>i.e., </em>pursuant to <em>lawfully </em>established procedures. Congress could not have meant that a procuring agency can adopt whatever suspension procedures it wishes \u2014 no matter how much those procedures depart from statutory or constitutional requirements. <em>ATL I </em>holds that thus far the Navy has not given to ATL all the rights to which it is entitled. The Navy\u2019s \u201csuspension\u201d cannot as yet be deemed to have been made \u201cpursuant to [properly] established administrative procedures\u201d\u2014 and it is therefore still outside the coverage of \u00a7 2393.</p>\n<p id=\"b1444-8\">The majority fears the problem of the Engineers\u2019 contracting officers having to \u201csecond guess\u201d the Navy but there is no such problem in this case. By March 7, 1984, (the day the Engineers decided it could not award the contracts to ATL), the Claims Court had already specifically held (January 6, 1984) the Navy \u201csuspension\u201d to have been illegal, and this court had already heard the appeal from that decision (the appeal was heard March 5, 1984). Why the Engineers believed, on March 7th, that the \u201csuspension\u201d had to be deemed \u201cpursuant to established administrative procedures\u201d is still a mystery to me.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1444-9\">I would hold that the Claims Court has jurisdiction over this pre-award \u201ccontract claim,\u201d reverse the ruling below, and remand to the Claims Court to consider the merits of ATL\u2019s claim to an injunction.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1444-6\">. I agree with the Comptroller General that \"the proper time for determining the effect of a suspension on a firm\u2019s eligibility for award is at award time.\u201d <em>Matter of Bauer Compressors, Inc., </em>GAO No. B-213973, dated April 23, 1984, slip op. p. 3. In the case before us, no award had been made as of March 7, 1984, and everything up to that date indicated that the Navy\u2019s \"suspension\u201d was unlawful.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
