Upon examining the relevant statutory provisions and legislative history, we conclude that Congress intended to vest in the Panel broad and final authority to put an end to disputes in which negotiations have failed to produce a settlement. Accordingly, while we are cognizant of the heavy presumption in favor of judicial review of agency action, we nevertheless hold that Congress precluded direct judicial review of Panel orders, except in extraordinary circumstances not present in this case. We note, however, that Panel orders are reviewable indirectly in the context of unfair labor practice proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b1596-14\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b1596-15\">In October 1979, the Council of Prison Locals (Council), a union representing employees of the United States Bureau of Prisons (Bureau), began to negotiate a labor contract in anticipation of the expiration of its existing contract. After several days of negotiation and several weeks of mediation, the parties remained at loggerheads over numerous articles in the proposed agreement. Accordingly, the Council requested that the Impasses Panel resolve the remaining disputes.</p>\n<p id=\"b1596-16\">The Impasses Panel then appointed a hearing officer, who presided at factfinding hearings and issued a report to the Panel summarizing the parties\u2019 positions on the eight issues in dispute. <em>See </em>Factfinder\u2019s Report, No. 79 FSIP 120 (Oct. 29, 1980), <em>reprinted in </em>Joint Appendix (J.A.) at 19-66. Three weeks later, the Impasses Panel directed the parties to resolve these disputes by including specified language in the agreement. <em>See </em>Decision and Order, No. 79 FSIP 120 (Nov. 19, 1980), <em>reprinted in </em>J.A. at 67-75. In most respects, the Panel\u2019s order favored the Bureau\u2019s proposals over the Council\u2019s. While the Panel declared that it had \u201cconsidered the entire record,\u201d and that \u201cin the circumstances of this case [ ] the impasse should be resolved in accordance with the Order set forth,\u201d it articulated no reasons for the particular contract language imposed upon the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b1596-17\">The Council then sought judicial review of the Panel\u2019s order in this court. <em>See Bureau of Prisons Council v. Federal Labor Relations Authority, </em>No. 81-1055 (Jan. 19, 1981) (petition for review). In July 1981, however, this court granted the Federal Labor Relations Authority\u2019s motion to dismiss the appeal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. <em>See id. </em>(July 2, 1981) (order granting motion to dismiss) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b1597-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1499\">*1499</page-number>Thereafter, the Council initiated the present action in the district court. The complaint alleged that federal question jurisdiction existed over the case, in addition to jurisdiction created by the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 702-704, the Mandamus Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1361, and the Declaratory Judgment Act, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 2201. <em>See </em>Complaint 111, <em>reprinted in </em>J.A. at 4. The district court, after examining the language, purpose and legislative history of the Federal Services Labor-Management Relations Statute (Act or Statute), concluded that it had no jurisdiction to entertain the Council\u2019s claims. <em>See Council of Prison Locals v. Howlett, </em>562 F.Supp. 849 (D.D.C.1983). Because we find a clearly discernible congressional intent to foreclose direct review of Impasses Panel orders, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1597-5\">II. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b1597-6\">At the outset, we recognize that access to judicial review of agency actions should be restricted only upon a clear and convincing showing that Congress intended to prohibit such judicial oversight. <em>See, e.g., Dunlop v. Bachowski, </em>421 U.S. 560, 567, 95 S.Ct. 1851, 1857, 44 L.Ed.2d 379 (1975); <em>Local 1219, American Federation of Government Employees v. Donovan, </em>683 F.2d 511, 517 (D.C.Cir.1982). Our examination of the relevant indicia of congressional intent, set forth below, convinces us that Congress meant to foreclose direct judicial review of Impasses Panel orders. We therefore affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b1597-8\">The statute establishes the Impasses Panel as \u201can entity within\u201d the Federal Labor Relations Authority (FLRA or Authority), 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7119(c)(1), and authorizes it to investigate \u201cpromptly\u201d any negotiation impasse and to \u201ctake whatever action is necessary and not inconsistent with this chapter to resolve the impasse,\u201d <em>id. </em>\u00a7 7119(c)(5)(A), (B)(iii). The statute thus commits to the panel \u2022 broad authority to make swift decisions in order to end disputes in which the negotiation process between a federal agency and its employees has failed.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1597-9\">In addition, the statute makes the Panel\u2019s orders \u201cbinding on [the] parties during the term of the agreement, unless the parties agree otherwise.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 7119(c)(5)(C). While section 7123 specifically provides for judicial review of orders by the <em>Authority, </em>there is no provision for such review of <em>Panel </em>orders, and Panel orders are not appealable even to the Authority. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 7105. Accordingly, the statute gives every reasonable indication that orders by the Impasses Panel are final and nonreviewable.</p>\n<p id=\"b1597-10\">The legislative history of the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978, which gave statutory recognition to the Impasses Panel,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> confirms this understanding. First, the Administration\u2019s proposed bill provided for no review of Panel orders; in fact, section 305 of the proposed bill would have rendered \u201c[t]he decisions of the Authority on any matter within its jurisdiction ... final and not subject to judicial review.\u201d H.R. Doc. No. 341, 95th Cong., 2d Sess. 7 (1978) (message from the President transmitting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1500\">*1500</page-number>Proposal to Reform the Federal Personnel Management System), <em>reprinted in </em>Subcommittee on Postal Personnel and Modernization of the House Committee on Post Office and Civil Service, 96th Cong., 1st Sess., <em>Legislative History of the Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute, Title VII of the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 </em>637 (1979) [hereinafter <em>Legislative History </em>]. The Senate bill made all Panel orders appealable to the Authority, but restricted judicial review of Authority decisions to include appeals only from unfair labor practice proceedings, except when constitutional questions were raised. <em>See Legislative History </em>at 567, 584-85, 604-05 (sections 7204(c)(4), 7216(f) and 7235(h) of S. 2640); H.R.Rep. No. 1717, 95th Cong., 2d Sess. 153 (1978) (Conference Report), <em>reprinted in Legislative History </em>at 821, U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News 1978, p. 2723. Thus, the Administration\u2019s proposed bill and the Senate bill both envisioned that Panel orders would generally not be subject to direct judicial review.</p>\n<p id=\"b1598-4\"><em>For </em>the purposes <em>of our </em>review today, the House bill is of primary importance, because its provision regarding the Impasses Panel was incorporated <em>verbatim </em>into the final Act.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Compare </em>124 Cong.Rec. H9698 (daily ed. Sept. 13, 1978), <em>reprinted in Legislative History </em>at 977-78 (section 7119 of H.R. 11280) <em>with </em>5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7119. As the House Committee Report that accompanied the bill explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1598-5\">Notice of any final action of the Panel must be promptly served upon the parties, and the action is final and binding upon the parties during the term of the agreement, unless the parties agree otherwise. <em>Final action of the Panel under this section is not subject to appeal, </em>and failure to comply with any final action ordered by the Panel constitutes an unfair labor practice____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1598-10\">H.R.Rep. No. 1403, 95th Cong., 2d Sess. 54 (1978), <em>reprinted in Legislative History </em>at 700 (emphasis supplied). A clearer suggestion that Congress intended no appeal from Panel decisions would be difficult to imagine.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We therefore find that Congress has restricted the courts from subjecting Panel actions to direct judicial scrutiny.</p>\n<p id=\"b1598-11\">However, our conclusion today does not mean that absolutely <em>no </em>judicial review of Panel orders is available. As the House report, <em>supra, </em>noted, \u201cfailure to comply with any final action ordered by the Panel constitutes an unfair labor practice.\u201d <em>See also </em>5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7116(a)(6), (b)(6) (it is an unfair labor practice for an agency or a labor organization \u201cto fail or refuse to cooperate in impasse procedures and impasse decisions\u201d). Once the Authority issues findings of fact and an order in an unfair labor practice proceeding, <em>see </em>5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7118(a)(7), the parties may seek review in the courts of appeals, <em>see id. </em>\u00a7 7123(a). In such an appeal, the courts may review the validity of the Panel order in question. <em>See, e.g., American Federation of Government Employees v. FLRA, </em>712 F.2d 640, 641 n. 4 (D.C.Cir.1983) (\u201cPanel decisions are reviewable, first by the Authority, then in court in an unfair labor practice proceeding.\u201d); <em>Department of Treasury v. FLRA, </em>707 F.2d 574, 577 n. 7 (D.C.Cir.1983) (same). In light of our examination of the statute and its legislative history, we agree with the district court that this specific review procedure, established by the statute, forecloses the assumption of general federal question or mandamus jurisdiction. 562 F.Supp. at 851.</p>\n<p id=\"b1598-12\">Of course, in exceptional circumstances, a district court may exercise federal jurisdiction to invalidate a Panel order made \u201cin excess of its delegated powers <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1501\">*1501</page-number>and contrary to a specific prohibition of the Act.\u201d <em>Leedom v. Kyne, </em>358 U.S. 184, 188, 79 S.Ct. 180, 184, 3 L.Ed.2d 210 (1958). The invocation of <em>Leedom </em>jurisdiction is extraordinary; to justify such jurisdiction, there must be a \u201cspecific provision of the Act which, although it is \u2018clear and mandatory/ \u201d was nevertheless violated by the Panel. <em>Physicians National House Staff Association v. Fanning, </em>642 F.2d 492, 496 (D.C.Cir.1980) (en banc) (quoting <em>Leedom, </em>358 U.S. at 188, 79 S.Ct. at 183), <em>cert. denied, </em>450 U.S. 917, 101 S.Ct. 1360, 67 L.Ed.2d 342 (1981). In this case, the Council contends that the Panel\u2019s order exceeds its statutory authority because, according to the Council, the Panel \u201cmay not direct parties to agree to proposals or make concessions.\u201d <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Complaint 1116, <em>reprinted in </em>J.A. at 7. However, section 7119(c) (5)(B)(iii), which authorizes the Panel to \u201ctake whatever action is necessary and not inconsistent with this chapter to resolve the impasse,\u201d appears to contemplate imposed settlements. <em>See, e.g., American Federation of Government Employees v. FLRA, </em>712 F.2d at 646 &amp; n. 24; <em>American Federation of Government Employees v. FLRA, </em>691 F.2d 565, 569 n. 26 (D.C.Cir.1982), ce<em>rt. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 103 S.Ct. 2085, 77 L.Ed.2d 297 (1983); <em>Department of Defense v. FLRA, </em>659 F.2d 1140, 1146 (D.C.Cir.1981), <em>cert. denied sub nom. American Federation of Government Employees v. FLRA, </em>455 U.S. 945, 102 S.Ct. 1443, 71 L.Ed.2d 658 (1982); <em>see also Nebraska Military Department v. FLRA, </em>705 F.2d 945, 950 n. 7 (8th Cir.1983). Thus, the Panel\u2019s action does not clearly exceed its authority in the respect alleged by the Council.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1599-12\">Additionally, the Council complains that \u201cthe [Panel\u2019s] decision is arbitrary and not in accordance with law, since it includes no explanation for the actions taken by the Panel.\u201d Complaint 1116. However, nothing in the Act requires the Panel to articulate reasons or to make findings; instead, as we explained <em>supra </em>at 4-5, the statute contemplates swift, decisive action by the Panel to settle an impasse. While the Administrative Procedure Act enables a reviewing court to set aside agency action found to be \u201carbitrary and capricious,\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2)(A), it does not apply when the relevant statutes \u201cpreclude review\u201d or when the relevant agency action \u201cis committed to discretion by law,\u201d <em>id. </em>\u00a7 701(a). In the present circumstances, the Panel order at issue in this case is outside the reach of APA standards.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In any event, the APA does not clearly oblige the Panel to give reasons for its actions, and such clarity of obligation is necessary for the exercise of <em>Leedom </em>jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1599-13\">Finally, we believe that our decision today is consistent with the public policies embodied in the statutory scheme of review. The Impasses Panel serves as a mechanism of last resort in the speedy resolution of disputes, after negotiations have failed. By providing no direct re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1502\">*1502</page-number>course to the courts, the Congress evidently intended to supplement speed with finality.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The availability of protracted litigation would undermine these values of speed and finality evidenced in the statutory scheme. <em>See Devine v. White, </em>697 F.2d 421, 435-36 (D.C.Cir.1983); <em>Physicians National House Staff Association v. Fanning, </em>642 F.2d 492 (D.C.Cir.1980) (en banc), <em>cert. denied, </em>450 U.S. 917, 101 S.Ct. 1360, 67 L.Ed.2d 342 (1981). While on occasion such a scheme may result in uncorrected errors of judgment, it is Congress, and not this court, that has the authority to alter the scheme of review.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1600-4\">III. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b1600-5\">Accordingly, the judgment of the district court dismissing this case is</p>\n<p id=\"b1600-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1597-7\">. Unlike the situation in <em>Local 1219, American Federation of Government Employees, </em>in this case the Panel has not restricted its discretion through the adoption of regulations. <em>Compare Local 1219, </em>683 F.2d at 515-16 (describing regulatory scheme that \"does not contemplate that the Director shall have complete discretion\u201d) <em>with </em>5 C.F.R. \u00a7 2471.11 (reiterating statutory language; Panel \"may take whatever action is necessary and not inconsistent with 5 U.S.C. chapter 71 to resolve the impasse\u201d). Furthermore, in <em>Local 1219, </em>we noted that \"permissive language would [not] offer conclusive evidence of congressional intent to preclude review.\u201d 683 F.2d at 516 n. 16. In this case, however, there is a great deal more evidence \u2014 in the statutory language and in the legislative history \u2014 that Congress intended to restrict judicial review. <em>See infra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1597-12\"><em>. </em>The Impasses Panel was first established by Executive Order as an agency within the Federal Labor Relations Council. <em>See </em>Exec. Order 11491 \u00a7\u00a7 5, 17 (Oct. 29, 1969) (the Panel \u201cin its discretion ... may settle the impasse by appropriate action\"). No judicial review was provided for in the Executive Order program. <em>See </em>Federal Personnel Management Project, <em>Option Paper Number Four </em>j[ 1(c)(2), <em>reprinted in Legislative History </em>at 1362.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1598-6\">. Through an oversight, the final Act provides additionally that \"the Panel shall consider the Impasse and <em>and </em>shall ____\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7119(c)(5)(A) (emphasis supplied).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1598-9\">. In addition, the Conference Report restricts its discussion of judicial review to the \"decisions of the Authority\" and \"matters that are appealable to the Authority.\" H.R.Rep. No. 1717, 95th Cong., 2d Sess. 153 (1978), <em>reprinted in Legislative History </em>at 821, U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin. News 1978, p. 2887. Under the bill as reported by\u201e the Conference Committee, just as in the final Act, Panel orders were not appealable to the Authority.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"a5v-dedup-0\">. To support its claim, the Council relies upon section 7103(a)(12) of title 5, which defines \"collective bargaining.\" Under this provision, the obligation to engage in collective bargaining \"does not compel either party to agree to a proposal or to make a concession.\" This definition of collective bargaining, however, does not settle the question of the scope of the Panel's authority.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1599-9\">. <em>Leedom </em>jurisdiction might be justified by a showing that the Panel's action was clearly <em>not </em>\"consistent with\u201d chapter 71 of title 5. <em>See </em>5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7119(c)(5)(B)(iii). For example, a Penal order might clearly impinge upon employees\u2019 rights established by 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7102, or clearly disregard the rights and duties of agencies and recognized bargaining units established by 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 7106, 7111-7114. We find no such clear departure from the requirements of chapter 71 in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1599-14\">. The APA does not afford \"an implied grant of subject-matter jurisdiction permitting federal judicial review of agency action.\" <em>Califano v. Sanders, </em>430 U.S. 99, 107, 97 S.Ct. 980, 985, 51 L.Ed.2d 192 (1977). Similarly, the Declaratory Judgment Act does not create an independent federal jurisdictional basis. <em>See Skelly Oil Co. v. Phillips Petroleum Co., </em>339 U.S. 667, 671-72, 70 S.Ct. 876, 878-879, 94 L.Ed. 1194 (1950); <em>Potomac Passengers Ass\u2019n v. Chesapeake &amp; Ohio Ry. Co., </em>520 F.2d 91, 97 (D.C.Cir.1975). We do not decide today whether federal jurisdiction might exist over a declaratory action filed in anticipation of an impending unfair labor practice proceeding.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b1600-8\">. As the Federal Personnel Management Project explained in 1977, \"the Federal sector has few incentives to the parties to reach an agreement \u2014 -in particular, there are not strike deadlines, with default costs, as exist in the private sector.\u201d <em>Legislative History </em>at 1402. In addition, \"[wjithout some form of finality, fact finding in difficult cases may be only a waste of time.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1403. Accordingly, the Project looked to the Impasses Panel to bring \u201cfinality to the negotiation process.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1400.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b1600-9\">. We recognize, however, the shortcomings of the unfair labor practices proceeding as the exclusive means for assuring judicial review of Panel orders. The decision to defy an existing labor contract \u2014 -even if the relevant contract term were imposed by a Panel order- \u2014 is not to be taken lightly. Such defiance could subject the union to prolonged administrative proceedings, followed perhaps by a cease and desist order, before judicial review could be available. <em>See </em>5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7118. Furthermore, in many situations \u2014 for instance, where an employee <em>benefit </em>rather than a <em>burden </em>is at issue \u2014 it is difficult to see what the union could do to challenge the disputed contract term, since it may not resort to a \"strike, work stoppage, or slowdown\u201d under pain of <em>decertification. See id. </em>\u00a7 7120(f).</p>\n<p id=\"b1600-20\">Presented with such a choice, it is most likely that a union would often go along with the contract, and relinquish the opportunity for judicial review, rather than risk such calamities. Perhaps Congress wished to pay this price in return for swift and final Panel authority. In any event, our decision today adheres to the language and legislative history of the Act. Of course, Congress remains free to alter the scheme of review as it sees fit.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
