(Hanover). The claim asserted under the Pennsylvania No-Fault Motor Vehicle Insurance Act<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> arises from injuries sustained by Dobrowsky in an automobile accident that occurred in 1981. The primary issue before us is whether the bankruptcy court employed an improper burden of proof in evaluating the medical evidence. We hold that it did and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-16\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-17\">On March 23,1981, Dobrowsky was in an automobile accident in which he suffered head and back injuries. At the time of the accident Dobrowsky was insured under an automobile insurance policy issued by Hanover. Hanover paid all of Dobrowsky\u2019s medical expenses from March 23, 1981 until August 24, 1981 and furnished work-loss benefits from April 5, 1981 through August 21, 1981. In September, Hanover informed Dobrowsky that, retroactive to August 19, 1981, it would not honor his claims for no-fault benefits because it had determined that medical treatment was no longer indicated.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-18\">Responding to Hanover\u2019s decision to discontinue benefits, Dobrowsky filed a complaint on February 5, 1982, to recover benefits under the Pennsylvania no-fault insurance act. In his complaint, Dobrowsky alleged that: 1) he continued to receive needed medical treatment for injuries sustained in the March 23 accident and had incurred $5,252.00 in unreimbursed expenses, and 2) as a result of the accident, he had been unable to work through December 31,1981, and therefore was entitled to $4,294.00 in additional work-loss benefits. To support these allegations, Dobrowsky asserted that, six months after the accident, he developed disabling symptoms including headaches, depression, fatigue, acute anxiety, blackouts, and general malaise for which he sought treatment from Dr. Arnold Sadwin, a board-certified neuropsychi-atrist. Hanover denied any obligation to pay no-fault benefits accruing after August 19, 1981 and counterclaimed for overpayment of work loss benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-19\">During a bench trial in the bankruptcy court, Dr. Sadwin testified that Dobrowsky exhibited symptoms of post-concussion syndrome which were precipitated by the head \u25a0trauma sustained in the car accident. Drs. Harvey Lisgar and Gilbert Kasirky, Do-browsky\u2019s primary physicians, and other medical and psychological specialists called <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>by Hanover, offered testimony, however, that contradicted both Dr. Sadwin\u2019s diagnosis and his theory of causation.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-4\">After reviewing all the medical testimony, the bankruptcy court found that Do-browsky had \u201cnot met his burden of proving by unequivocal medical evidence that his alleged post-concussion syndrome and accompanying symptoms were caused by the March 23, 1981 accident.\u201d As a result, the bankruptcy court, 26 B.R. 319, denied Dobrowsky\u2019s claims against Hanover and granted Hanover\u2019s counterclaim for overpaid benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">Dobrowsky appealed this decision to the district court. The district court concluded that the bankruptcy court\u2019s determination was not clearly erroneous because \u201cplaintiff did not sustain its burden of proof by a preponderance of the evidence that the injuries complained of after August 19, 1981 were caused by the accident____\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b190-6\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-7\">Although the parties did not question the bankruptcy court\u2019s jurisdiction over an insurance claim based on state law, we believe it appropriate to consider briefly the basis of that court\u2019s authority in this case. The predicate for the bankruptcy court\u2019s assumption of jurisdiction over the insurance claim was that Dobrowsky had earlier filed a Chapter 11 petition for reorganization in that court. Under the Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1978, the bankruptcy court was empowered to adjudicate all \u201ccivil proceedings ... related to cases under Title 11.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1471(b) and (c) (1976 and Supp. III).</p>\n<p id=\"b190-8\">Effective December 23, 1982, however, the Supreme Court invalidated the jurisdiction of the bankruptcy courts over such \u201crelated\u201d claims. <em>Northern Pipe Line Co. v. Marathon Pipeline Co., </em>458 U.S. 50, 102 S.Ct. 2858, 73 L.Ed.2d 598 (1982). In <em>Northern Pipe Line, </em>the Court held that the judicial power of the United States to adjudicate private common law rights, in that case the right to recover damages in a contract action, must be vested in courts whose judges enjoy the protection of Article III of the Constitution, including life tenure. <em>Id. </em>102 S.Ct. at 2871. The bankruptcy court\u2019s exercise of jurisdiction over a state law tort claim would appear to fall squarely within the prohibition of <em>Northern Pipe Line.</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Because the bankruptcy court, however, entered its order on December 20, 1982, three days before <em>Northern Pipe Line </em>went into effect, and because the Supreme Court specifically declared that <em>Northern Pipe Line </em>was prospective only, the bankruptcy court properly exercised its jurisdiction under \u00a7\u00a7 1471(b) and (c). <em>See Coastal Steel v. Tilghman Wheelabrator Ltd., </em>709 F.2d 190, 198 (3d Cir.1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b190-11\">The main issue presented on appeal is whether the district court erred as a matter of law in concluding that the bankruptcy court had employed the proper burden of proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-12\">Under Pennsylvania law, which the parties concede is controlling in reviewing the adjudication of Dobrowsky\u2019s claim under the Pennsylvania no-fault statute, when an injury is not the \u201cobvious, natural or probable result\u201d of an accident, the plaintiff has the preliminary burden of demonstrating causation by introducing expert medical testimony. <em>Kravinsky v. Glover, </em>263 Pa.Super. 8, 396 A.2d 1349 (1979). In such a situation the Pennsylvania courts require that the plaintiff\u2019s expert testify with \u201creasonable certainty\u201d that \u201cthe result in question did come from the cause alleged,\u201d or that the accident was a substantial factor in bringing about the injury. <em>Id. </em>at 1355-56. Once the plaintiff has introduced the threshold expert medical testi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>mony, the trier of fact must determine, considering all the evidence presented at trial, whether the plaintiff has established \u201cby a preponderance of the evidence\u201d a causal connection between the injury and the accident. <em>Hamil v. Bashline, </em>481 Pa. 256, 392 A.2d 1280, 1285 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b191-4\">At various points throughout its opinion, however, the bankruptcy court appeared to hold that Dobrowsky failed to sustain his burden of proving, by unequivocal medical testimony, that the accident caused the injury. For example, the bankruptcy judge concluded that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AKV\">the debtor <em>has not proven by unequivocal medical testimony </em>that the alleged post-concussion syndrome was causally connected to the accident in question or that the physical therapy received after August 24, 1981, was for a condition caused by the accident____ In short, the debtor has not met his <em>burden of proving, by unequivocal medical evidence, </em>that his alleged post-concussion syndrome and accompanying symptoms were caused by the March 23, 1981 accident____(emphasis added)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b191-8\">These determinations suggest that the bankruptcy court may have imposed an erroneous standard of proof on the plaintiff. The use of a threshold burden based on \u201cunequivocal medical testimony\u201d understandably has caused confusion in tort eases. The Pennsylvania Commonwealth Court recently has attempted to explain and clarify the concept:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-9\">The phrase \u201cunequivocal medical testimony\u201d is a shorthand term lawyers and courts have devised and used for the rule of the common law, brought over to the field of workmen\u2019s compensation, to the effect that one contending that a condition of disability is the result of injury arising in the course of employment must, unless the disability is clearly the result of a work injury, produce the expert medical testimony that the claimant\u2019s condition in the expert\u2019s professional opinion did come from the work experience.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b191-10\"><em>Philadelphia College of Osteopathic Medicine v. Workmen\u2019s Compensation Appeal Board, </em>77 Pa.Cmwlth. 202, 465 A.2d 132, 134 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b191-12\">In practice, therefore, the claimant must produce a competent medical expert who, with reasonable certainty, will give evidence of facts which, if accepted by the factfinder, will support an award.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-13\">In determining tort claims under the no-fault statute, Pennsylvania courts thus have applied a two-step analysis to evaluate medical evidence. First, the plaintiff must present expert medical testimony unequivocably establishing causation. It is clear from the record that Dr. Sadwin\u2019s statement that there was a causal link between the accident and Dobrowsky\u2019s ensuing symptom was sufficiently unequivocal to establish causation. <em>See Hamil v. Bashline, </em>481 Pa. 256, 392 A.2d 1280, 1285 (1978). Indeed, at oral argument Hanover\u2019s attorney conceded the sufficiency of Dr. Sadwin\u2019s direct testimony unequivocally linking the injury with the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-14\">After the plaintiff has presented unequivocal medical testimony on causation, the trial court must then evaluate, under a preponderance of the evidence standard, whether the accident, in fact, did cause the injury. At this point in the proceedings the factfinder must weigh all the evidence introduced to determine whether plaintiff has proved his case. Nowhere in its opinion, however, does the bankruptcy court refer to weighing all the testimony by using the \u201cpreponderance of the evidence\u201d standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-15\">The bankruptcy court\u2019s use of a single legal standard based on unequivocal medical testimony against which it evaluated both the threshold issue of causation as well as the totality of the medical evidence was erroneous as a matter of law. Accordingly, the judgment of the district court, affirming the bankruptcy court order, will be vacated, and the case remanded to the district court for proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b189-20\">. 40 P.S. \u00a7 1009.101 et seq.
