Bavis &amp; Associates, Inc., both manufacture automatic equipment used by banks at drive-in windows. Bavis, which holds a patent on its equipment, placed in a national banking journal an advertisement that, in effect, threatened suit for contributory infringement against any bank buying a machine that might infringe on Bavis\u2019s patent. Kidde then brought this suit for declaratory and in-junctive relief in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Iowa, alleging that the advertisement was intended by Bavis to be understood as a reference to Kidde\u2019s machine, that Bavis\u2019s patent is invalid or not infringed, and that Bavis\u2019s actions amounted to unfair competition and intentional interference with busi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1086\">*1086</page-number>ness relationships. Subject-matter jurisdiction was based in part on 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1338 (patent cases). The District Court dismissed for want of personal jurisdiction over Bavis, an Ohio citizen.</p>\n<p id=\"b1184-4\">We have no jurisdiction over this appeal.
