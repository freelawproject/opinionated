He contends the government failed to bring him to trial within the seventy-day period provided for by the Speedy Trial Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3161-3174 (the Act). We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We conclude that Frey was tried in violation of the Act, and reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-18\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b449-19\">A Maryland grand jury indicted Frey on June 2, 1981. His arraignment in the United States District Court for the District of Maryland on June 16 triggered the running of the seventy-day period within which the Act required the government to bring him-to trial. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3161(c)(1). In calculating this seventy-day period, however, the Act allows the exclusion of certain delays that fall within narrowly defined exceptions. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3161(h). Both Frey and the government agree that 123 days of excludable time resulted from Frey\u2019s successful efforts to have venue changed from Maryland to the Central District of California. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3161(h)(1)(G) (delay resulting from transfer proceedings is ex-cludable). Based on this conceded exclusion, the latest possible trial date consistent with the Act\u2019s seventy-day limit was December 26, 1981. Frey\u2019s trial began nine days later on January 6, 1982. Unfortunately, when the district judge set Frey\u2019s trial date, he relied on an Assistant United States Attorney\u2019s miscalculation of the time within which the Act would require trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-21\">In an earlier appeal by Frey, we concluded in an unpublished disposition that the evidence was sufficient to sustain the judgment. The calculation of a trial date under the Act, however, appeared to overstate the number of days excludable because of the transfer of Frey\u2019s case. The government argued that the \u201cends of justice\u201d provision in section 3161(h)(8)(A) permitted exclusion of this additional time because Frey\u2019s attorney had rejected December 16, 1981 as a possible trial date due to a previously scheduled trial. We vacated Frey\u2019s conviction and remanded the case to the district court for consideration of the argument raised by the government. On remand, the district court found eleven days excludable under section 3161(h)(8)(A). Of this time, the district court attributed three days each to Frey\u2019s counsel and the government attorney because of their involvement in other previously scheduled trials. The district \u2022 judge attributed the remaining five days to his own unavailability during attendance at a judicial conference. Because of the exclusion of these eleven additional days, the district court reinstated Frey\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b450-4\">We limit our review of the factual finding that exclusion of the eleven days served the ends of justice to determining whether the finding is clearly erroneous. <em>United States v. Perez-Reveles, </em>715 F.2d 1348, 1351 n. 2 (9th Cir.1983). However, we review de novo the legal standards applied by the district court in making its ends-of-justice determination. <em>Id.; United States v. Nance, </em>666 F.2d 353, 356 (9th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>456 U.S. 918, 102 S.Ct. 1776, 72 L.Ed.2d 179 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b450-5\">We start with an analysis of the place of section 3161(h)(8)(A) in the scheme of the Act. The Act contains an extensive list of automatic exclusions for certain narrowly defined delays resulting from necessary pretrial proceedings, interlocutory appeals, and other similar causes. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3161(h)(l)-(7). Additionally, in response to congressional concern that courts should have discretion to deal effectively with individual cases, <em>see </em>S.Rep. No. 1021, 93rd Cong., 2d Sess. 21 (1974) (Senate Report), the Act permits the district court to exclude delays granted when it finds that \u201cthe ends of justice ... outweigh the best interest of the public and the defendant in a speedy trial.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3161(h)(8)(A). Obviously, overuse of the broad discretion embodied in this section could undermine the strict time limits of the Act. <em>See United States v. Nance, </em>666 F.2d at 355; <em>see also </em>Senate Report, <em>supra, </em>at 21 (ends of justice provision intended to \u201cavoid the pitfalls of unnecessary rigidity on the one hand, and a loop-hole which would nullify the intent of the legislation on the other\u201d). Congress recognized this possibility and the legislative history of the Act makes it clear that Congress intended that this exclusion be \u201crarely used.\u201d Senate Report, <em>supra, </em>at 41. To avoid abuses of section 3161(h)(8)(A), Congress required the district court to \u201cset forth, in the record of the case, either orally or in writing, its reasons for finding that the ends of justice [would be] served\u201d by granting the excludable delay. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3161(h)(8)(A); H.R. Rep. No. 1508, 93rd Cong., 2d Sess. 33, <em>reprinted in </em>1974 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad. News 7401, 7426 (reasons must be \u201cset forth with particularity\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b450-7\">In the present case, however, neither side disputes that the district judge set Frey\u2019s trial date and, indeed, tried Frey without making any ends-of-justice findings. Only after Frey had succeeded in having his conviction vacated on appeal did the district judge make the findings required by section 3161(h)(8)(A). Although he made these findings on June 3,1983, the district judge clearly intended them to be effective, <em>nunc pro tunc, </em>as of the time he set Frey\u2019s trial date.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-8\">The issue before us is whether the district court may, subsequent to its grant of a continuance, undertake for the first time to consider the factors and provide the findings required by section 3161(h)(8) to exclude time under the Act. We view such a practice as inconsistent with the language and policy of the Act. The section allows the exclusion of delays resulting from a continuance granted <em>\u201con the basis of </em>[the district judge\u2019s] findings\u201d (emphasis added). The Act excludes such delays because the judge expressly determines, when granting the delays, that the ends of justice served outweigh the benefit to the public and the defendant of proceeding promptly to trial. <em>See </em>Senate Report, <em>supra, </em>at 39 (judge must make ends-of-justice findings before granting excludable delay). In this ease, the district judge did not notice when he set the trial date that a violation of the Act would occur. He could not have granted the delay \u201cbased on\u201d the required findings concerning the ends of justice, because he did not realize that he was granting a delay. In this instance, making the required findings <em>nunc pro tunc </em>as of the day the trial was set cannot bring Frey\u2019s case within section 3161(h)(8)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b450-9\">Other decisions construing this section of the Act support our conclusion. <em>United States v. Carrasquillo, </em>667 F.2d 382 (3d Cir.1981), is relevant. There, a deputy district court clerk attempted to accommodate the schedule of the defendant\u2019s attorney <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>and delayed setting a trial date until after the Act\u2019s seventy-day period had expired. The district judge first learned of the problem on the first day of trial when the defendant made a motion to dismiss for violation of the Act. The district judge then made retroactive ends-of-justice findings, excluding the period when defense counsel would have been unavailable. Faced with facts strikingly similar to those in the case before us, the Third Circuit reversed the district court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b451-5\">We believe that the period of delay involved in this case cannot fairly be said to be one \u201cresulting from a continuance granted by\u201d the district court, because the judge\u2019s characterization of the earlier action of the deputy clerk as constituting a continuance did not occur until after the statutory time limit had expired.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AGy\"><em>Id. </em>at 386; <em>see also United States v. Brooks, </em>697 F.2d 517, 522 (3d Cir.1982) (\u201c[A] judge could not grant an \u2018ends of justice\u2019 continuance <em>nunc pro tunc, </em>providing after the fact justification for unauthorized delays. Rather ... the judge must consider the matter at the outset and determine whether the \u2018ends of justice\u2019 require that the trial be postponed.\u201d), <em>cert. denied, </em>460 U.S. 1071, 103 S.Ct. 1526, 75 L.Ed.2d 949 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b451-6\">We also recently held in <em>United States v. Perez-Reveles </em>that, because the district court failed to make sufficient findings concerning the ends of justice, a delay caused by a continuance could not be excluded under the Act. 715 F.2d at 1352-53. The defendant\u2019s attorney had requested the granted continuance, but, significantly, this did not affect our holding. In light of this aspect of <em>Perez-Reveles, </em>the government\u2019s argument that Frey may have waived his rights under the Act by not objecting to the trial date set by the district judge is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-7\">The government contends that <em>United States v. Clifford, </em>664 F.2d 1090, 1095 (8th Cir.1981), and <em>United States v. Edwards, </em>627 F.2d 460, 461 (D.C.Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>449 U.S. 872, 101 S.Ct. 211, 66 L.Ed.2d 92 (1980), support the practice of placing ends-of-justice findings in the record after the court has granted a continuance under section 3161(h)(8)(A). Neither <em>Clifford </em>nor <em>Edwards </em>supports the procedure used in Frey\u2019s case, however. In both <em>Clifford </em>and <em>Edwards, </em>the district judges granted continuances only after considering the proper ends-of-justice factors. The judges failed to enter their findings into the record at the time they granted the continuances, but the later record of their findings amply demonstrated that they had given the continuances the careful contemporaneous consideration required by the Act. <em>United States v. Clifford, </em>664 F.2d at 1094-95; <em>United States v. Edwards, </em>627 F.2d at 461; <em>see United States v. Brooks, </em>697 F.2d at 522; <em>see also United States v. Bryant, </em>726 F.2d 510, 511 (9th Cir.1984) (\u201c[Simultaneous findings [are] unnecessary so long as the trial court later shows that the delay was motivated by proper considerations.\u201d). In contrast, the <em>nunc pro tunc </em>findings made by the district court in the present case do not demonstrate that it originally based its delay in scheduling Frey\u2019s trial on any of the factors relevant to section 3161(h)(8)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b451-9\">In light of our conclusion that the district court erred by making <em>nunc pro tunc </em>findings to accommodate its unwitting violation of the Act, we need not decide whether the three types of delays identified in the district court\u2019s findings are excludable under section 3161(h)(8)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b451-10\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b451-11\">Because the eleven days identified in the district court's findings are not ex-cludable under section 3161(h)(8)(A), Frey was not brought to trial within the seventy-day period established by the Act. Thus, the district court should have granted Frey\u2019s motion to dismiss the indictment against him. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3162(a)(2). The district judge may make the dismissal for noncompliance with the Act either with or without prejudice, in his discretion. <em>Id.; United States v. Perez-Reveles, </em>715 F.2d at 1353. Section 3162(a)(2) requires that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b452-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>In determining whether to dismiss the case with or without prejudice, the court shall consider, among others, each of the following factors: the seriousness of the offense; the facts and circumstances of the case which led to the dismissal; and the impact of a reprosecution on the administration of [the Act] and on the administration of justice.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b452-4\">If the district court decides to dismiss this case without prejudice, Frey may be retried following the filing of a new indictment; but the present judgment of conviction against him may not be reinstated. <em>See United States v. Perez-Reveles, </em>715 F.2d at 1353.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">REVERSED AND REMANDED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
