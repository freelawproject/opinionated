The question before us is whether the transaction at issue here constituted a \u201cpurchase\u201d or \u201csale\u201d of securities under section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder. Northland Capital Corporation (\u201cNorthland\u201d) brought this action under the 1934 Securities Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 78a-78kk (1982), (\u201cthe \u201934 Act\u201d) and under the common law of fraud against A. David Silver, A. David Silver &amp; Co., and various inside and outside directors of Watkins Corporation (\u201cWatkins\u201d) to recover $50,000 remitted by Northland to Watkins via a wire transfer. Northland claimed that it had standing to bring a private cause of action under Rule 10b-5, promulgated under section 10(b) of the \u201934 Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78j(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b1520-16\">On motion for summary judgment, the District Court concluded that Northland was not a purchaser of securities, inasmuch as Northland and Watkins never came to a meeting of the minds with respect to the purchase of the securities in question. The court therefore concluded that, under the case of <em>Blue Chip Stamps v. Manor Drug Stores, </em>421 U.S. 723, 95 S.Ct. 1917, 44 L.Ed.2d 539 (1975), requiring a plaintiff to be an actual purchaser to satisfy Rule 10b-5\u2019s requirement that the fraud be \u201cin connection with the purchase or sale of any securities,\u201d Northland had no standing to bring a private cause of action under the \u201934 Act. The court dismissed the remaining common-law claim, which was based solely upon the court\u2019s pendent jurisdiction. Northland appealed the District Court\u2019s judgment. For the reasons stated below, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1520-17\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b1520-18\">Successful closings of financial deals are fundamentally all alike; every unsuccessful closing is unsuccessful in its own way. The events that led to the unsuccessful closing here and precipitated this lawsuit began in the fall of 1978 when Watkins Corporation undertook a search for additional capital. Watkins, a District of Columbia corporation with its principal corporate offices in Northern Virginia, was engaged in the business of operating franchise outlets for the International House of Pancakes on the eastern seaboard. At its height, Watkins operated thirty such restaurants. The founder, chief executive officer, and major stockholder was Philander Claxton, III. Of relevance to the matter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1423\">*1423</page-number>before us, Mr. Claxton\u2019s principal duties included responsibility for the financial matters of the enterprise. Defendant Edward Waibel, the president of Watkins, was principally responsible for operations. There was no chief financial officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b1521-5\">In 1978, Mr. Claxton on behalf of Watkins engaged A. David Silver of A. David Silver <em>&amp; </em>Co., a New York venture capital concern, to raise one million dollars of additional capital for Watkins. This target was to be reached through a private placement with a consortium of small business investment companies (SBIC\u2019s). Mr. Silver prepared a memorandum describing the proposed investment and detailing Watkins\u2019 operations and financial condition. His description of Watkins was based on a 1977 audit report and a 1978 opinion letter purportedly prepared by Price, Waterhouse <em>&amp; </em>Co., both of which are now acknowledged to be forgeries. Mr. Silver sent the memorandum to a variety of 'SBIC\u2019s, including Allied Capital Corporation (\u201cAllied\u201d), based in Washington, D.C., and plaintiff North-land Capital Corporation, based in Duluth, Minnesota. Plaintiff\u2019s Opposition to Defendant\u2019s Statement of Material Facts 1126 (\u201cPlaintiff\u2019s Statement\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1521-6\">Allied acted as the syndicator of the Watkins financing, persuading six other SBIC\u2019s to participate in the transaction. Allied was also a major participant, reserving $250,000 of the investment for itself. Plaintiff\u2019s Statement 11 29. Northland, on the other hand, was located far from the center of the action which was about to transpire. Capitalized at $350,000, North-land had at the time of this transaction only two employees, Mr. Barnum, who was its President, and Mrs. Dunphy, who was Mr. Barnum\u2019s secretary and who enjoyed the title of Assistant Secretary. Because of its small capitalization, Northland limited its participation in the Watkins financing to $50,000. Transcript of Deposition of George Barnum at 56 (\u201cBarnum Deposition\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1521-11\">Like other SBIC\u2019s, Northland\u2019s sole business is to invest in small business. It is a veteran in the field, having participated in 30 to 40 investments since its incorporation in 1967. Barnum Deposition at 8. North-land, however, generally relies upon other SBIC\u2019s to close its portion of the transaction because Northland is usually a minor participant in any given financing and because, in Mr. Barnum\u2019s words, Duluth is not \u201cthe venture capital center of the world.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 10. This financing was no exception to the rule. Mr. Barnum authorized Allied, which he characterized as \u201cthe lead investor,\u201d to act on Northland\u2019s behalf at the contemplated closing. <em>Id. </em>at 16, 101. He further stated that Northland \u201crode on [Allied\u2019s] coattails as far as setting the terms of the investment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b1521-12\">After consulting with the other participating SBIC\u2019s Allied set forth the terms of the proposed investment in a letter dated January 26, 1979. For purposes of this case, the most important requirements imposed by the SBIC\u2019s upon Watkins were as follows: (1) that all amounts received from the investors would be used to construct new franchise locations; (2) that the total amount of the financing would be placed in a separate \u201cdevelopment account\u201d from which it could not be withdrawn except for use in the construction of franchise locations; and (3) that after the construction of a building, the realty and improvements would, under a sale-leaseback arrangement, be sold to other investors and leased back to Watkins.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In return for their infu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1424\">*1424</page-number>sion of funds, the SBIC\u2019s were to receive not only interest but also <em>stock warrants to be delivered at the time of the closing. </em>Letter of David Gladstone of Allied Capital, to Mr. Claxton, Watkins Corp. (Jan. 26, 1979), Gladstone Deposition Exhibit 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b1522-4\">With the transaction so structured, the closing was scheduled for March 9, 1979, a fact known to Mr. Barnum. He elected not to attend, however, having deserted Duluth for the sunnier climes of a West Indies island with no telephone service. Barnum Deposition at\" 37. Mrs. Dunphy, his secretary, testified that she was instructed by Mr. Barnum to dispatch the $50,000 North-land investment in accordance with Allied\u2019s instructions. Deposition of Elizabeth Dun-phy at 8 (\u201cDunphy Deposition\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1522-5\">The ensuing events are of pivotal importance as to the nature of the Northland-Watkins transaction. By March 8, Mrs. Dunphy had received no instructions from Allied. As she herself was leaving for vacation the following day, she telephoned Allied\u2019s offices in Washington. However, according to Mrs. Dunphy\u2019s deposition testimony, she was unable to speak with an officer of Allied, and an Allied secretary suggested that she call Mr. Silver. She did so, but, according to Mrs. Dunphy, Mr. Silver unhelpfully replied that he was busy, that he did not know the date of the closing, and that she should call Mr. Claxton. In response to her ensuing call, Mr. Clax-ton told Mrs. Dunphy to wire the funds to the Union First National Bank of Washington in care of one Mr. Cherouny, a senior vice president of Union First. She wired the money, \u201cassumed\u201d that it would be held in escrow until the closing, and departed on vacation. Dunphy Deposition at 9-12. Fatefully, however, the funds were transferred by the bank to Watkins\u2019 general corporate account. This telephone conversation constituted the whole of Northland\u2019s communications with Watkins prior to the scheduled closing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1522-8\">The next day, March 9, 1979, Mr. Gladstone, an officer of Allied, and Mr. Claxton met in an attempt to close the transaction. The meeting was unsuccessful because, among other things, Mr. Gladstone was concerned that Watkins\u2019 Board of Directors had not approved the transaction and that an opinion letter purportedly prepared by Watkins\u2019 counsel bore tell-tale marks of a forgery. A week later, Mr. Gladstone sent a letter which identified twenty-two items necessary \u201cin order to close this loan.\u201d Soon thereafter, on March 21, 1979, negotiations foundered. On April 6, 1979, Mr. Silver sent a letter to the representatives of the participating SBIC\u2019s, officially informing them that the deal had been called off. The letter stated: \u201c[A]ll of you have been to closings that didn\u2019t close. That\u2019s what happened with Watkins Corp____\u201d Memorandum of A. David Silver, A. David Silver &amp; Co., to David Gladstone, Gladstone Deposition Exhibit 10. The financing, in fact, was never closed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1522-10\">At the unsuccessful March 9 meeting, Mr. Claxton nonetheless executed a number of documents. Among those documents was an agreement letter from Watkins to Allied, setting forth Watkins\u2019 version of the contemplated transaction. The Watkins\u2019 version states, contrary to Allied\u2019s proposal of January 26, 1979, that Watkins would use 50 percent of the net proceeds from the financing for working capital and 50 percent to acquire additional sites to operate as restaurants. Letter of Mr. Claxton, Watkins Corp., to Allied Investment Corp., Paragraph 1(A)(8). Barnum Deposition, Exhibit 6. The agreement letter stated that the closing was to take place on March 9. It further contemplated that notes and warrants \u201cin the total aggregate amount of not less than seven hundred fifty thousand dollars ... will be sold by the Company to the Purchasers at closing____\u201d <em>Id., </em>Paragraph 1(A)(1). The Watkins letter stated several \u201cconditions of closing,\u201d including the requirement that Watkins furnish the purchasers with a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1425\">*1425</page-number>copy of the Board of Directors\u2019 resolution and a legal opinion from Watkins\u2019 counsel satisfactory to the purchasers. <em>Id., </em>Paragraph V. The agreement letter had spaces at the end reserved for the signatures of the various SBIC investors to signify their acceptance of the terms of the proposed agreement. Importantly, these spaces remained blank.</p>\n<p id=\"b1523-4\">Finally, and still at the March 9 meeting, Mr. Claxton signed at least one stock warrant and one debenture note. This warrant was subject to the terms of the Watkins letter which, as we have just seen, was unsigned by the SBIC\u2019s. Stock Warrant No. 6 of Watkins Corp. (March 9, 1979). Deposition of Marianne Sharp, Exhibit 2-C. The agreement, the note, and the stock warrant were then sent to Northland.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1523-5\">On March 16, 1979, a full week after the March 9 meeting, Watkins\u2019 Board of Directors met to consider Mr. Claxton\u2019s proposal for the 1.25 million dollar financing.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> By earlier memorandum, dated March 7, 1979, Mr. Claxton had notified his Board of the terms of the investment. This memorandum, like Watkins\u2019 version of the agreement already discussed, stated that the terms of the financing would allow Watkins to use half the proceeds as working capital and half for real estate development.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In response to Mr. Claxton\u2019s motion, the Board on March 16 authorized Watkins to borrow $1,250,000 from Allied, Northland and five other SBIC\u2019s \u201cupon the terms and conditions substantially in accord with those outlined in [Mr. Claxton\u2019s] summary of the loan transaction and as discussed at this meeting of the Board of Directors March 16, 1979.\u201d Deposition of Edward Waibel, Exhibit 1. Despite the Board\u2019s approval, no closing, as we have seen, ever took place.</p>\n<p id=\"b1523-11\">A good deal of water had flowed over the dam by the time of Mr. Barnum\u2019s return from the West Indies in early April. Upon his return to Duluth, Mr. Barnum found the documents sent the previous month by Mr. Claxton. When Mr. Barnum also discovered, from Mr. Silver\u2019s April 6 letter, that the financing had not closed, he became \u201csuspicious\u201d and thereupon called Mr. Claxton. In their ensuing telephone conversation, Mr. Claxton agreed to send back to Northland the $50,000 remittance and further agreed to treat the $50,000 as a simple loan to be repaid immediately with interest. Barnum Deposition at 39-41. On April 18, 1979, Mr. Claxton sent a Watkins check in the amount of $50,767.12 to North-land, representing both principal and accumulated interest on the loan. Mr. Barnum attempted to cash the check, but it was returned for insufficient funds. On May 10, 1979, Watkins filed a voluntary petition in bankruptcy in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia.</p>\n<p id=\"b1523-12\">Northland then brought the present fraud action under both the \u201934 Act and the common law in the United States District <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1426\">*1426</page-number>Court for the District of Columbia. In its federal claim, Northland alleged that it had been defrauded \u201cin connection with a purchase or sale of a security\u201d and therefore enjoyed standing to sue under section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder. After extensive discovery, defendants moved for summary judgment on the grounds that on the undisputed facts Northland was not a \u201cpurchaser\u201d of securities. The District Court granted the motion, concluding that there was \u201cno meeting of minds\u201d between Watkins and North-land and thus Northland never became a purchaser of securities. The court then dismissed the pendent common-law claim. Northland appealed the district court\u2019s judgment. Prior to oral argument in this appeal, Northland entered into a voluntary dismissal with all defendants except Edward Waibel, Watkins\u2019 former president.</p>\n<p id=\"b1524-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1524-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b1524-6\">Section 10(b) of the \u201934 Act and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder prohibit manipulative and fraudulent devices \u201cin connection with a purchase or sale of a security.\u201d <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Interpreting this language in <em>Blue Chip Stamps v. Manor Drug Stores, </em>421 U.S. 723, 95 S.Ct. 1917, 44 L.Ed.2d 539 (1975), the Supreme Court held that only actual purchasers or sellers of securities may bring a private damages action under Rule 10b-5. While suggesting that such a limitation served the policy objective of avoiding vexatious litigation identified in the seminal case of <em>Birnbaum v. Newport Steel Corp., </em>193 F.2d 461 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>343 U.S. 956, 72 S.Ct. 1051, 96 L.Ed. 1356 (1952), the Court\u2019s holding was based ultimately on its interpretation of the language of the Act and its legislative history.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1524-9\">Thus, we reject at the outset appellant\u2019s argument that <em>Blue Chip\u2019s </em>holding should not govern cases such as the instant one since this type of case may not present a danger of strike suits. Indeed, in <em>Blue Chip </em>itself, the appellate court had accepted the <em>Birnbaum </em>interpretation of 10b-5 as a general principle, but carved out an exception in the circumstances of that case, because Manor Drug had been offered Blue Chip securities as part of an antitrust consent decree. The appellate court held that Manor\u2019s identification as an offeree in a written document served the same function as a contract in delimiting the appropriate plaintiffs under 10b-5. The Supreme Court, however, held to the contrary, concluding that entertaining such a theory \u201cwould leave the <em>Birnbaum </em>rule open to endless case-by-case erosion ... depending on whether a particular group of plaintiffs were thought ... to be sufficiently more discrete than the world of potential purchasers at large to justify an exception.\u201d 421 U.S. at 755, 95 S.Ct. at 1934.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1427\">*1427</page-number>In the <em>post-Blue Chip </em>securities world, a person must be a \u201cpurchaser\u201d or \u201cseller\u201d within the meaning of the Securities Exchange Act to have standing to bring suit under Rule 10b-5.</p>\n<p id=\"b1525-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b1525-6\">We thus turn to the question whether Northland is a \u201cpurchaser\u201d of securities. A \u201cpurchase or sale\u201d under the Act is defined as including \u201cany contract\u201d to purchase or sell a security. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78c(a)(13) &amp; (14). The terms \u201cpurchase\u201d and \u201csale\u201d are to be broadly construed to effectuate the remedial purposes of the \u201934 Act, <em>see Sacks v. Reynolds Securities, Inc., </em>593 F.2d 1234, 1240 (D.C.Cir.1978); <em>Goodman v. Epstein, </em>582 F.2d 388, 410 (7th Cir.1978), <em>cert. denied, </em>440 U.S. 939, 99 S.Ct. 1289, 59 L.Ed.2d 499 (1979), and are not limited to their common-law meaning. <em>See Broad v. Rockwell International Corp., </em>614 F.2d 418, 435 (5th Cir.1980). Therefore, courts have not allowed common-law technicalities, which may pose traps for the unwary and opportunities for the unscrupulous, to stand in the way of finding a statutorily cognizable \u201cpurchase\u201d or \u201csale.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1525-7\">The \u201934 Act\u2019s vital remedial purposes cannot, however, be permitted to strip the statutory words \u201cpurchase or sale\u201d of their core meaning. It is, after all, a statute with express terms that is before us for examination. <em>See Symons v. Chrysler Corp. Loan Guarantee Board, </em>670 F.2d 238, 241 (D.C.Cir.1981) (holding that the principle that remedial statutes are to be liberally construed to effectuate their purpose \u201cdoes not give the judiciary license, in interpreting a provision, to disregard entirely the plain meaning of words used by Congress\u201d). <em>See also Sacks v. Reynolds, Inc., </em>593 F.2d at 1240 (applying the plain meaning rule in the context of a 10b-5 action). A bedrock requirement for the formation of any contract or bargain between unrelated parties, including those constituting a purchase or sale, is that the putative purchaser and seller come to a meeting of the minds or, in the phrase of the Restatement (Second) of Contracts, mutual assent on the essential terms of the transaction.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> This requirement is presupposed by the case law interpreting Rule 10b-5: for instance, in determining when a purchase is made, courts look to the time at which there was a \u201cmeeting of the minds.\u201d <em>See Radiation Dynamics, Inc. v. Gold-muntz, </em>464 F.2d 876, 891 (2d Cir.1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b1525-11\">It is clear from the undisputed facts of this case that no mutual assent occurred <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1428\">*1428</page-number>between Watkins and Northland. In fi-nancings such as the one proposed here, transactions are usually consummated by a formal closing or settlement at which the parties formally agree to terms and execute the requisite documents embodying the agreement. In the contemporary age of lawyers, accountants, and financial analysts, a financing is seldom, if ever, the result of a simple handshake between two principals. The structure of the financing here was therefore typical. No oral agreement on terms was reached, and it is abundantly clear that all parties contemplated that a closing was necessary for there to be a deal. Indeed, Mr. Barnum expressly authorized Allied to act on Northland\u2019s behalf at the contemplated closing, thus not only signifying the understanding that a closing was necessary but also that Northland intended to enter the transaction as part of a consortium of investors, not as a solitary investor operating independently of its fellow SBIC\u2019s. The documents that Mr. Clax-ton sent out on behalf of Watkins on March 9 also plainly contemplated both a closing and a transaction with a group of investors.</p>\n<p id=\"b1526-4\">It is undisputed that the closing contemplated by the parties never took place. As we have seen, on the day the closing was to have occurred Allied, acting on behalf of the investors, found numerous differences with Watkins with respect to the terms of the transaction. In addition, Allied\u2019s representatives became suspicious about some of the supporting documentation provided by Watkins. These differences and suspicions were never resolved.</p>\n<p id=\"b1526-5\">Northland does not dispute this, but nonetheless contends that even in the absence of a closing, Mrs. Dunphy\u2019s wiring of $50,000 when taken together with Mr. Claxton\u2019s sending of a stock warrant and note to Northland represent a separate transaction between Northland and Watkins, cognizable under the federal securities laws. These actions, however, even when taken together, do not suggest that Northland and Watkins gave mutual assent to a contract or bargain constituting a purchase of securities. To have mutual assent in these circumstances, one party must have accepted by word or deed an offer from the other.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Here, under the specific circumstances presented, neither the wiring of the $50,000 nor the sending of the stock warrant can reasonably be interpreted as an acceptance.</p>\n<p id=\"b1526-8\">Northland, of course, was entirely at liberty to come to a separate agreement with Watkins, but the testimony of Mrs. Dun-phy, Northland\u2019s secretary, clearly indicated that it did not do so. As we have seen, Mrs. Dunphy testified that she was instructed to find out from Allied where she should send Northland\u2019s funds so as to be available for the closing. After unsuccessful attempts to get instructions from Allied, the lead investor, she called Mr. Claxton of Watkins to find out where she should wire the money. Mrs. Dunphy testified that she intended the $50,000 to be held in \u201cescrow\u201d until a closing occurred on the proposed $1,250,000 financing. Thus, Mrs. Dunphy\u2019s ministerial act can by no stretch of the imagination be interpreted as acceptance, on behalf of Northland, of a separate offer from Mr. Claxton. Her action in no wise changed the understanding of all the parties that Allied and Watkins would have to close the deal before a purchase would take place.</p>\n<p id=\"b1526-9\">Nor does Mr. Claxton\u2019s sending to North-land the Watkins\u2019 version of the letter agreement, together with a note and warrant which were subject to the terms of the letter, render the transaction a purchase notwithstanding the aborted closing. First, even if Mrs. Dunphy\u2019s sending the $50,000 could somehow be construed as an invitation to a separate, individual transaction that could have been consummated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1429\">*1429</page-number>without a formal closing, it is clear that the documents sent by Mr. Claxton to North-land were not intended to evidence or constitute an acceptance. Indeed, the agreement which Mr. Claxton sent to Northland had a space reserved for Northland\u2019s signature to allow Northland to evidence its acceptance of the terms of the agreement. <em>It is undisputed that neither Northland nor Allied acting on its behalf ever signed the </em>agreement.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Moreover, it is undisputed that the Watkins agreement letter contained a critical term plainly at variance with Allied\u2019s proposal on behalf of the SBIC\u2019s.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Thus, the agreement and warrant which Mr. Claxton returned to North-land contained materially different terms on an essential item of the contract from those Northland was offering, and thus could not constitute an acceptance. <em>See </em>Restatement (Second) of Contracts \u00a7 59.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1527-5\">Our conclusion that neither Mrs. Dun-phy\u2019s nor Mr. Claxton\u2019s actions sufficed to create a purchase of securities is confirmed by Mr. Barnum\u2019s own understanding. When Mr. Barnum returned to Duluth from the Caribbean he became suspicious when he found documents that would normally be sent as part of a closing, but discovered that in fact no closing had taken place. He promptly telephoned Mr. Clax-ton. They immediately agreed in that conversation that Northland\u2019s money would be returned, with interest, and that the transaction would be treated as a simple loan. Mr. Barnum never signed the proposed agreement that Mr. Claxton had sent. In short, Mr. Barnum, on behalf of Northland, never acted as a purchaser of a security but rather as one who was trying to recover money his company had plainly intended to place in escrow after discovering that the transaction had been called off.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1528-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1430\">*1430</page-number>C</p>\n<p id=\"b1528-4\">Northland argues that <em>Baurer v. Planning Group, Inc., </em>669 F.2d 770 (D.C.Cir.1981), compels the conclusion that a purchase or sale took place here. In <em>Baurer, </em>an investor advanced $15,000 in exchange for a promissory note from a company. The note provided that if at the end of a thirty-day period the investor and the company were not able to come to terms on a partnership venture, the $15,000 would become due and payable together with certain accrued interest. If, on the other hand, an agreement were reached, the note would be deemed paid in full and only accrued interest would be due. The court concluded that the promissory note was a security, because the terms of the agreement, described in the note, \u201cestablished its investment character.\u201d <em>Baurer, </em>669 F.2d at 778.</p>\n<p id=\"b1528-5\">Baurer\u2019s holding, however, is inapposite to the case before us. The issue here is not whether a warrant is a \u201csecurity,\u201d but whether Northland was a \u201cpurchaser\u201d of the warrant. In <em>Baurer, </em>no one argued that the investor did not purchase the note, for there was explicit mutual assent between the parties in the exchange of funds for the note. In this case, however, there was no mutual assent. Indeed, as we have seen, the financial transaction in which the warrant was to be purchased was never closed, and no separate bargain between Northland and Watkins was ever struck.</p>\n<p id=\"b1528-11\">Appellant also argues that we should analogize Mr. Claxton\u2019s sending of the documents to Northland to a pledge. Because <em>Rubin v. United States, </em>449 U.S. 424, 101 S.Ct. 698, 66 L.Ed.2d 633 (1981), holds that a pledge is a \u201csale\u201d of a security under the \u201933 Act, Northland contends that a pledge is also a sale of securities under the \u201934 Act. Passing over the substantial question whether the differences between the \u201933 Act and the \u201934 Act in the statutory definition of sale would compel a different conclusion about whether a pledge is a sale under the latter\u2019s definition,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> we conclude that no pledge occurred, for the simple reason that Northland and Watkins never agreed to a pledge of securities. Indeed, Northland, like the other SBIC\u2019s in the deal that Mr. Silver structured, never even bargained for a pledge but contemplated the outright purchase of Watkins' securities.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1528-12\">The dissent argues that the requirement of mutual assent in this case is not consistent with a variety of securities law deei-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1431\">*1431</page-number>sions. Dissent at 1435. We have already shown that it is consistent with controlling law of this circuit. The principal genre of cases from other circuits with which the dissent deems our approach inconsistent are the \u201cforced seller\u201d cases in which a dissenting shareholder is forced to exchange securities for cash or other securities in a liquidation or merger. That situation is exceedingly remote from the facts of this case. As the very name \u201cforced sale\u201d suggests, an exchange in a merger or liquidation that is a result of the operation of governing corporate law, and the contractual structure of corporate governance itself, is not different in kind from a contractual exchange. The scope and legal significance of both types of exchanges are defined by well established principles of law, unlike the aborted transaction here. Our holding today as to the facts presented to us by no means goes to the far different settings embodied in the \u201cforced seller\u201d cases.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1529-5\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b1529-6\">Finally, we emphasize that our decision does not in any manner undermine the broad remedial policies of Rule 10b-5 and the \u201934 Act. The '34 Act is designed to protect investors and safeguard the operation of the Nation\u2019s capital markets. However, as the Supreme Court has stated, \u201cCongress, in enacting the securities laws, did not intend to provide a broad federal remedy for all fraud.\u201d <em>Marine Bank v. Weaver, </em>455 U.S. 551, 556, 102 S.Ct. 1220, 1223, 71 L.Ed.2d 409 (1982). Specifically, the federal securities laws do not confer upon the federal courts a roving commission to address every injury that a sophisticated, albeit small, investment concern such as Northland may suffer in the course of <em>attempting </em>to negotiate and close a deal. The proximate cause of Northland\u2019s misfortune was plainly the failure to place the $50,000 in escrow until the closing. The proper business arrangements were not effected with Union First Bank, and the transfer transformed Watkins in effect into Northland\u2019s escrow agent. When no closing occurred, Watkins failed to return the funds Northland thought it had entrusted to Union First. Such facts might well give rise to claims under applicable District of Columbia or state law, but they simply do not constitute the purchase or sale of securities under the \u201934 Act.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1529-9\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1521-7\">.

The dissenting opinion seems to ignore the Supreme Court\u2019s refusal to engage in case-by-case policy analysis in <em>Blue Chip. </em>That refusal demonstrates that although the Supreme Court took policy analysis into account in reaching its conclusion that the '34 Act required a plaintiff to be a purchaser to have standing to sue, it established this requirement as a <em>per se </em>rule which could not generally be rebutted by policy considerations in individual cases. The dissent is also incorrect in stating that our requirement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1427\">*1427</page-number>of mutual assent, discussed in the text that follows, is at odds with any policy concern of <em>Blue Chip. </em>Dissent at 1434-1435. <em>Blue Chip </em>was concerned that \u201cvexatious\" litigation would result from allowing plaintiffs standing to sue on the mere allegation that they intended to buy or sell a security. The Court feared that defendants would have difficulty disposing of such suits because of the subjective nature of the plaintiff\u2019s proof of intent. <em>Blue Chip, </em>421 U.S. at 743, 95 S.Ct. at 1929. Vexatious litigation is obviously no more likely, however, when a plaintiff must show that there was mutual assent between the offeror and himself. Moreover, a plaintiff does not have to adduce proof of the defendant\u2019s subjective intent in order to prove mutual assent. The principle that objective manifestation of intent is controlling in contract formation is very well established. <em>See </em>Williston on Contracts 42 (1957).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b1525-9\">.

The dissent seems to imagine facts when it asserts that \"Claxton knew of the terms North-land desired when it sent its $50,000, but North-land did not know that Watkins had proposed its own terms.\u201d Dissent at 4. Under the undisputed facts, Northland was not playing the role of lone wolf, departing from the pack led by Allied to cut its own deal and present its own terms. It is clear beyond cavil that all Mrs. Dunphy was seeking to do in effecting the wire transfer was to have Northland's share of funds, pursuant to its commitment to the consortium, available for the closing that was destined not to be. By no stretch of the imagination, much less the facts, was Mrs. Dunphy setting forth some new or separate terms on behalf of Northland.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b1527-7\">.

We hold that, under these circumstances, where no manifestation of mutual assent ever existed between the parties, no \u201cpurchase\u201d within the meaning of the \u201934 Act occurred. This holding, however, does not prevent a court from finding a purchase where there was an apparent manifestation of mutual assent that was negated by a party\u2019s misrepresentation. An example of this situation would be when a person agrees to sell valuable securities of Company A contained in a paper envelope to an investor who agrees to the transaction. In our hypothetical, the envelope actually contains the worthless securities of Company B. Under Restatement (Second) of Contracts \u00a7 163 (stating that \u201d[i]f a misrepresentation as to the character or essential terms of a proposed contract induces conduct that appears to be a manifestation of assent by one who neither knows or has reasonable opportunity to know of the character or essential terms of the proposed contract, his conduct is not effective as a manifestation of assent), there is no contract in this hypothetical because the would-be seller\u2019s misrepresentation went to an essential term. Thus, the investor\u2019s apparent assent is not effective. Even though there is no contract, a court might well find a \u201cpurchase\" under the meaning of the \u201934 Act; what allows the apparent seller to escape contractual obligation is a misrepresentation \u2014 the very evil at which the Act is aimed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1527-11\">We do not, of course, take issue with any of the salutary principles of contract law relied on by the dissent. Dissent at 1433-1434. On the undisputed facts of the case, however, they are inapplicable. When on March 8, Mrs. Dunphy on Northland\u2019s behalf wired the funds to Union First, she was not performing Northland\u2019s side of the bargain, but was rather attempting to put the money in escrow until Allied closed the deal on Northland\u2019s behalf. At the aborted closing on the very next day Allied, as Northland\u2019s agent, became aware that Mr. Claxton was proposing different terms from those of the investing SBIC\u2019s. When Mr. Barnum and Mrs. Dun-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1430\">*1430</page-number>phy returned from vacation, Mr. Barnum found an agreement, that Mr. Claxton had sent, with differing terms. Mr. Barnum never signed that varying agreement. Therefore, at no time could Northland, as the dissenting opinion asserts, have reasonably been under the impression that Watkins had accepted performance on the terms of the investing SBIC\u2019s.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b1528-7\">. The \u201933 Act defines a sale as including \"every contract of sale or disposition of a security or <em>interest in a </em>security____\u2019\u2019 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 77b(3). The \u201934 Act defines a sale as including simply \"every contract to sell or otherwise dispose of [a security].\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78c(a)(14). The circuits are split on whether a pledge comes within the ambit of the definition in section 78c(a)(14) and therefore on whether it is a sufficient predicate for jurisdiction under 10b-5. <em>Compare, e.g., Alley v.

Appellant also argues that <em>Sacks v. Reynolds Securities, Inc., </em>593 F.2d 1234 (D.C.Cir.1978), supports its position that it is a purchaser. In <em>Sacks, </em>a former account representative of Reynolds sued under 10b-5 claiming that Reynolds had failed to transfer her personal accounts and accounts of some of her customers to her new brokerage firm. She claims that because the agreement between Reynolds and her to transfer the securities was a contract to \"otherwise dispose of [securities],\" <em>see </em>15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78c(a)(14), the transaction constituted a \"sale\u201d of securities within the meaning of the Act. The <em>Sacks </em>court held that the transaction was not a \"sale,\" because the purchase or sale requirement of 10b-5 required \"some surrendering of control, change in ownership, or change in fundamental nature of an investment.\u201d Northland seizes on this language to suggest that its \u201csurrendering\u201d of funds and Mr. Claxton's \"surrendering\u201d of a security gives it standing to sue under 10b-5. Once again, however, <em>Sacks </em>is inapposite because it did not address the unique problem presented here, namely the lack of mutual assent. In <em>Sacks </em>there was no dispute that the account representative and Reynolds agreed to the transfer.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b1529-7\">. We do not, needless to say, suggest the presence of a requirement of <em>mutual </em>assent regardless of the circumstances presented. Rather, since we do not have before us a transaction reflecting an extraordinary change in the structure of the corporation, as would be the case with a merger or liquidation, we must examine a transaction between two <em>unrelated </em>parties to determine the nature of that transaction and the legal incidents flowing therefrom. The element of mutual assent thus guides us, in these circumstances, in our analysis, but we obviously need not and therefore do not erect it as a requirement in settings completely alien to the facts before us.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b1529-12\">.

The majority, I think mistakenly, finds no \u201cpurchase or sale\u201d for Security Exchange Act purposes, because the preconditions laid down by Northland to issuing the warrant had not been met, and hence there was no \u201cmeeting of the minds\u201d between Watkins and Northland. By imposing its own \u201cmeeting of the minds\u201d prerequisite to a \u201cpurchase or sale\u201d under the Act the majority shields from the investor protection provisions of the Securities Exchange Act <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1432\">*1432</page-number>the very kind of fraudulent conduct which was a core concern of the drafters. Furthermore, the panel\u2019s restrictive reading of \u201cpurchase or sale\u201d in this case on the one hand is directly at odds with the broad reading of \u201cpurchase or sale\u201d that other courts have adopted to effectuate the Act\u2019s remedial purposes and on the other hand serves none of the policies which the Supreme Court has in different factual contexts invoked to justify a purchaser or seller requirement for standing in private damage actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1530-4\">The facts of this case have been amply, and in the main accurately, detailed in the majority opinion. Because this is an appeal from the district court\u2019s granting of the defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment, we must view the facts and the reasonable inferences that may be. drawn from them in the light most favorable to the appellant. <em>See National Souvenir Center, Inc. v. Historic Figures, Inc., </em>728 F.2d 503, 512 (D.C.Cir.1984). So viewed, I believe the majority has given too short shrift to several crucial facts which militate against dismissal of the defrauded company\u2019s claim before any trial has been held. Based on the uncontested facts before the trial court, this is what happened on the critical days in early March.</p>\n<p id=\"b1530-5\">On March 8, after failing to get requested instructions from Allied, the lead SBIC on whom Northland relied to set the final terms of its intended investment, North-land called Claxton directly and asked how it should transmit the money it intended to invest in Watkins in time for the closing scheduled for March 9. Claxton instructed Northland to wire the funds directly to Watkins\u2019 bank account. We can therefore presume Claxton was aware on March 9 that Northland\u2019s $50,000 had already been deposited in Watkins\u2019 account.</p>\n<p id=\"b1530-6\">On March 9, Claxton met with David Gladstone, executive vice-president of Allied, to close the deal, but they were unable to do so. There is no question Claxton knew at this time that Allied\u2019s proposal for the joint investment was different from Watkins\u2019 proposal of the contemplated transaction. This was one reason no deal came off. Nonetheless, despite the failure to close the deal on March 9, and with full knowledge that Northland desired to participate in a loan along with other SBICs only on Allied\u2019s terms, Claxton did not return Northland\u2019s $50,000. Rather, acting as a duly authorized officer of Watkins, he sent Northland, alone among the SBIC\u2019s, a stock warrant and debenture note for $50,-000, the precise amount deposited in Watkins\u2019 account, subject to the terms of the agreement ultimately worked out.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> From these facts, it must be inferred in appellant\u2019s favor that the warrant and note were sent by Claxton in return for Northland\u2019s $50,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b1530-9\">There is little question that Claxton\u2019s undisputed conduct \u2014 use of forged financial statements to induce investment in his company \u2014 is a target of Rule 10b-5. <em>See Baurer v. Planning Group, Inc., </em>669 F.2d 770, 773 n. 14 (D.C.Cir.1981) (\u201cRule 10b-5 reaches \u2018any person\u2019 engaged in fraud to induce the purchase of securities\u201d) (quoting A. Bromberg &amp; L. Lowenfels, Securities Law \u00a7 2.1 (1981)). There is also little question that Northland was injured by such misrepresentation because it lost $50,000, which Watkins appropriated to its own use. The majority nonetheless concludes that because Allied\u2019s fortuitous discovery of the forgery prevented the deal from closing, Northland cannot maintain a Rule 10b-5 action.</p>\n<p id=\"b1530-10\">The majority purports to rest this conclusion on the strict tenets of contract law which it says require a \u201cmeeting of the minds\u201d between Watkins and Northland before Northland can be a \u201cpurchaser\u201d of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1433\">*1433</page-number>securities so as to come within the protective orbit of the antifraud provisions of the Securities Exchange Act. Maj.Op., at 1427 n. 9. In so doing, it shortchanges the investor here in three respects.</p>\n<p id=\"b1531-4\">First, it ignores the well accepted principle of contract law that a person who knows the terms of an agreement proposed by another party, and who subsequently accepts performance by that party, cannot avoid his contractual obligations by claiming there was \u201cno meeting of the minds.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>See Amicizia Societa Navegazione v. Chilean Nitrate &amp; Iodine Sales Corp., </em>184 F.Supp. 116 (S.D.N.Y.1959), <em>aff'd, </em>274 F.2d 805 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>363 U.S. 843, 80 S.Ct. 1612, 4 L.Ed.2d 1727 (1960); <em>see, e.g., Associated Hardware Supply Co. v. Big Wheel Distributing Co., </em>355 F.2d 114 (3d Cir.1965); <em>In re Mailers Unlimited, Inc., </em>6 B.R. 238, 240 (Bkrtcy.E.D.Pa.1980). \u201cThe manifestations of the. parties are operative [to contractually bind them] in accordance with the meaning attached to them by one of the parties if that party does not know of any different meaning attached by the other, and the other knows the meaning attached by the first party.\u201d Restatement (Second) of Contracts \u00a7 20(2) (1979). And \u201cthe conduct of a party [such as acceptance of performance] may mainfest assent even though he does not in fact assent.\u201d Restatement (Second) of Contracts \u00a7 19(3) (1979). Here, Claxton knew of the terms Northland desired when it sent its $50,000, but Northland did not know that Watkins had proposed its own terms. Thus, North-land could reasonably regard Watkins\u2019 acceptance of its $50,000 as manifesting assent to those terms, and Watkins, having accepted the money, cannot later claim no contract was formed because there was no meeting of the minds.</p>\n<p id=\"b1531-8\">Second, the majority ignores the definition of \u201csale\u201d in the Securities Act of 1933, passed only one year before the Securities Exchange Act and authoritatively used as a source for definition of statutory terms common to both Acts. The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 did not explicitly define \u201cpurchase or sale,\u201d but there is \u201cno reason to believe that Congress intended, one year after the passage of the Securities Act, to dilute the concept of sale in the Securities Exchange Act.\u201d <em>Lawrence v. Securities Exchange Comm., </em>398 F.2d 276, 280 (1st Cir.1968).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In the 1933 Act Congress explicitly provided that \u201csale\u201d includes any \u201cdisposition of ... an interest in a security for value,\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 77b(3), and thereby obviously envisioned coverage of transactions like that between Northland and Watkins here.</p>\n<p id=\"b1531-9\">Third, the majority fails to identify a single policy reason why a court should <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1434\">*1434</page-number>ignore both contract law principles and federal securities law history, and read Rule 10b-5\u2019s \u201cpurchase or sale\u201d prerequisite more restrictively than the common law. All of this it does in the name of the test for standing to bring a private damage suit adopted by <em>Blue Chip Stamps v. Manor Drug Stores, </em>421 U.S. 723, 95 S.Ct. 1917, 44 L.Ed.2d 539 (1975). Maj.Op. at 1426-1427. I disagree, however, that <em>Blue Chip </em>in any way supports the majority's conclusion that no purchase or sale occurred in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1532-4\">In <em>Blue Chip, </em>the Supreme Court, following the rule first laid down in <em>Birnbaum v. Newport Steel Co., </em>193 F.2d 461 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>343 U.S. 956, 72 S.Ct. 1051, 96 L.Ed. 1356 (1952), announced that only \u201cpurchasers or sellers\u201d of securities have standing to bring private damage actions under Rule 10b-5. In doing so, <em>Blue Chip </em>never talked about \u201cmeeting of the minds\u201d as part of its \u201cpurchaser or seller\u201d requirement. Rather, it explained that the <em>Birnbaum </em>rule denied standing to three classes of potential plaintiffs: (1) offerees who allege merely that they <em>would have </em>purchased a security but for the fraud, (2) shareholders who allege merely that they <em>would have </em>sold their shares but for the fraud, and (3) shareholders who allege that the fraud decreased the value of their investment, but who do not allege that the fraud influenced their investment decisions. <em>See Blue Chip, </em>421 U.S. at 738-39, 95 S.Ct. at 1926-27. The stated purpose of Blue Chip\u2019s adoption of the <em>Birnbaum </em>standing doctrine was the prevention of \u201cstrike suits\u201d and the elimination of private damage actions that would require a treacherous inquiry into the plaintiffs\u2019 subjective decisions regarding whether to invest or sell. <em>See </em>421 U.S. at 740, 746, 95 S.Ct. at 1927, 1930.</p>\n<p id=\"b1532-5\">In this case, by contrast, Northland obviously does not fall within any of the three classes of plaintiffs that <em>Blue Chip </em>sought to eliminate. In fact, the policies reflected in <em>Blue Chip </em>do not apply at all, since Northland paid its money and received securities in return. No court would have to embark on a subjective inquiry in order to decide whether a \u201cpurchase or sale\u201d occurred in this case; under the facts alleged, it seems quite clear that an objective exchange of money and securities between Northland and Claxton took place. Quite candidly, the majority\u2019s concerns regarding the <em>Blue Chip </em>standing doctrine entirely elude me.</p>\n<p id=\"b1532-9\">In fact, a closer examination of the <em>Blue Chip </em>case reveals that the exchange of money for securities that occurred in this case should be considered a \u201cpurchase or sale\u201d for the purposes of Rule 10b-5. As the Court noted in <em>Blue Chip, </em>the bounds of standing to sue cannot be \u201cderive[d] from the language of [section] 10(b).\u201d 421 U.S. at 737, 95 S.Ct. at 1926. Accordingly, the Court turned to \u201cpolicy considerations ... to flesh out the portions of the law with respect to which neither the congressional enactment nor the administrative regulations offer conclusive guidance.\u201d <em>Id. </em>While recognizing the overriding remedial policy behind the implied cause of action under section 10(b) \u2014 to allow \u201cdeserving plaintiffs [to] recover ... damages which in fact have been caused by violations of Rule 10b-5,\u201d 421 U.S. at 738, 95 S.Ct. at 1926\u2014 the court nonetheless adopted the <em>Birn-baum </em>rule because that rule has \u201ccountervailing advantages ... purely as a matter of policy,\u201d namely limiting the potential for widespread vexatious litigation. 421 U.S. at 739-40, 95 S.Ct. at 1927-28. I can imagine no legitimate need for such a \u201climiting principle\u201d to bar this suit, however,'where money and securities changed hands, and the plaintiff apparently lost a sizeable sum.</p>\n<p id=\"b1532-10\">Contrary to the majority\u2019s statement, <em>Blue Chip\u2019s </em>holding was thus not \u201cbased ultimately on its interpreting] ... the language of the Act and its legislative history,\u201d so much as on its balancing of the injuries that would flow from including or excluding nonsellers and nonpurchasers from the Rule\u2019s protection.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>Blue Chip\u2019s </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1435\">*1435</page-number>policy analysis thus can be instructively applied here. The majority\u2019s \u201cmeeting of the minds\u201d prerequisite, like the <em>Birn-baum </em>rule, has the \u201cdisadvantage\u201d of \u201cpreventing] some deserving plaintiffs from recovering damages that in fact have been caused by violations of Rule 10b-5.\u201d 421 U.S. at 738, 95 S.Ct. at 1926. On the other hand, it not only has none of the \u201ccountervailing advantages\u201d of the <em>Birnbaum </em>rule in preventing \u201cstrike suits\u201d and litigation turning on subjective proof of what a plaintiff would have done in a hypothetical situation, but in fact, the \u201cmeeting of the minds\u201d requirement is in tension with the purposes of the <em>Birnbaum </em>rule because it invites a defendant to rebut objective evidence of a sale with subjective contentions that the parties never actually agreed to the terms of the transaction. <em>See Blue Chip, </em>421 U.S. at 747, 95 S.Ct. at 1931. The majority\u2019s tunnel-visioned focus on <em>Blue </em>Chip\u2019s discussion of the Act\u2019s language and history is thus understandable since, unlike the Court in that case, it can point to no policy of the Act which is advanced in this case by restricting standing of an actual investor, who pays money intending to purchase one kind of security, but receives a different and ultimately worthless kind from the seller.</p>\n<p id=\"b1533-5\">As this and other courts have recognized, the remedial policies of the anti-fraud provision of the Security Exchange Act embodied in Rule 10b-5 command a liberal interpretation of \u201cpurchase or sale\u201d; accordingly, the courts have read the rule to allow private damage suits in situations much less recognizable as traditional sales or purchases than this one. <em>See Sacks v. Reynolds Securities, Inc., </em>593 F.2d 1234, 1240 (D.C.Cir.1978); <em>Broad v. Rockwell International Corp., </em>614 F.2d 418, 435 (5th Cir.1980), <em>aff'd in part and rev\u2019d in part on other grounds, </em>642 F.2d 929 (5th Cir.) <em>(en banc), cert. denied, </em>454 U.S. 965, 102 S.Ct. 506, 70 L.Ed.2d 380 (1981); <em>Goodman v. Epstein, </em>582 F.2d 388, 410 (7th Cir.1978), <em>cert. denied, </em>440 U.S. 939, 99 S.Ct. 1289, 59 L.Ed.2d 499 (1979); <em>Mader v. Armel, </em>402 F.2d 158, 160 (6th Cir.1968), ce<em>rt. denied, </em>394 U.S. 930, 89 S.Ct. 1188, 22 L.Ed.2d 459 (1969); <em>Vine v. Beneficial Finance Co., </em>374 F.2d 627, 634 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>389 U.S. 970, 88 S.Ct. 463, 19 L.Ed.2d 460 (1967). Thus, courts have granted standing to plaintiffs: (i) whose securities were converted to claims for cash by merger or liquidation,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> (ii) where stock was pledged as collateral for a loan,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> (iii) and where a shareholder agreement granted a corporation a right of first refusal to purchase stock.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> These decisions demonstrate that, for purposes of standing to sue under Rule 10b-5, all that is required is a non-gratuitous \u201csurrendering of control, change in ownership, or change in the fundamental nature of an investment____\u201d <em>Sacks, </em>593 F.2d at 1240; <em>see also Baurer, </em>669 F.2d at 779 (a purchase of a security occurred since \u201cnotes were ... disposed of ... and value was given [in return]\u201d); <em>see also </em>15 U.S.C. \u00a7 77b(3) (1933 Act definition of \u201csale\u201d includes any disposition of a security for value).</p>\n<p id=\"b1533-14\">Although the majority says it takes no issue with the holdings of these cases, Maj.Op. text at n. 17, its self imposed requirement in this case that there be a \u201cmeeting of the minds\u201d in fact poses an irreconcilable conflict with them. Under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1436\">*1436</page-number>the majority\u2019s test, for instance, a merger or liquidation\u2019s transformation of a stockholder\u2019s shares into claims for cash would involve no \u201cmeeting of the minds\u201d since the stockholder never agrees to dispose of the stock for a bargained price. The majority\u2019s cite to one isolated Rule 10b-5 case that did invoke the \u201cmeeting of the minds\u201d doctrine, <em>see </em>Maj.Op. at 1427 (citing <em>Radiation Dynamics, Inc. v. Goldmuntz, </em>464 F.2d 876, 891 (2d Cir.1972)), also fails to persuade. <em>Radiation Dynamics </em>was an insider trading case in which the issue was whether the defendant had already agreed to purchase the shares before he acquired the inside information. If the fraud postdated the agreement to purchase, no cognizable injury occurred. The court used a \u201cmeeting of the minds\u201d test to determine at what point the agreement was reached. That use of the \u201cmeeting of the minds\u201d test in no way predetermines its requirement as an element of a \u201cpurchase or sale\u201d under the Securities Exchange Act. Where, as here, the commitment is completed by the very act of paying for the security, injury is attributable to the fraud whether or not an actual agreement was reached. Thus, <em>Radiation Dynamics </em>does not stand for the proposition that no sale or purchase can exist without a \u201cmeeting of the minds.\u201d In this case, the policies of the Act require recognition that a \u201csale\u201d occurred when the deal failed to close and Claxton nevertheless sent Northland a stock purchase warrant and a debenture note rather than returning Northland\u2019s $50,000.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1534-8\">In sum, I find that the majority\u2019s insistence on a meeting of the minds, in the strict contract law sense, as a prerequisite to finding a purchase or sale for purposes of allowing a private damages action under the Securities Exchange Act contravenes the remedial policy of Rule 10b-5, conflicts with prevailing precedent, which broadly construes the purchase or sale requirement for Rule 10b-5 actions, and is totally unjustified by the Supreme Court\u2019s <em>Blue Chip </em>opinion.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> For these reasons, I dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1530-7\">. At argument, counsel for Northland stated that, although the district court record is unclear, in fact no other SBIC received stock warrants. Appellees did not take issue with this assertion.

In responding to this dissent, the majority makes several discrete arguments to which I reply in this note:</p>\n<p id=\"b1534-6\">(a) It argues that <em>Blue Chip </em>pointed out the difference between the phrase \"offer and sale\u201d in the 1933 Act and \"sale\u201d in the 1934 Act and thereby inferred a broader coverage of transactions under the 1933 Act. <em>See </em>Maj.Op. 1426 n. 5. There is <em>no </em>debate on that point. I argue something quite different \u2014 that \"sale\u201d means the same thing in both Acts. <em>See supra </em>1433 n. 3. The authorities are unanimous on this point, and there is not even a whisper in <em>Blue Chip </em>to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b1534-10\">(b) Nor is there any dispute, as the majority suggests, <em>see </em>Maj.Op. 1426 n. 7, over <em>Blue Chip\u2019s </em>holding that one who did not buy or sell or security has no standing to bring a Rule 10b-5 damages action. Again, that has nothing to do with whether the facts here fall within the definition of \"sale.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1534-11\">(c) In its footnote 11, the majority misper-ceives my view of the facts. I do not contend that by sending $50,000 to Watkins, Northland was making an independent offer. I maintain rather that because Northland tendered performance <em>(i.e., </em>payment) under terms proposed by the other SBIC\u2019s as part of the joint venture, and because Claxton knew that Northland made the payment intending to be a joint venturer under these terms and that the joint venture did not close, he was obligated to return North-land\u2019s money or else be held legally responsible for having \"sold\u201d the warrants he mailed out in return for the money.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
