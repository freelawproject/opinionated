The boy\u2019s natural father, Clarence Slappey, moved under Rule 24 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure to intervene as a plaintiff and share in any recovery even though he never married Ms. Pickett or legitimized Car-lus. The district judge concluded that under Georgia law Slappey had forfeited whatever parental rights he had with respect to Carlus prior to the child\u2019s death and denied the motion to intervene. Slap-pey now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-14\">The question of whether the father of a child born out of wedlock can recover for the wrongful death of the child was unsettled under Georgia law until the recent decision in <em>Solomon v. Sapp, </em>252 Ga. 532, 314 S.E.2d 878 (1984):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-15\">We now hold that in order for a biological father to participate in a recovery based upon the wrongful death of his child born out of wedlock, he must have provided, during the lifetime of the child, such financial support as shall have been reasonable under the facts and circumstances of the case, bearing in mind the needs of the child and the ability of the father to pay. If such a father should establish that he had provided support according to this standard, then he would be entitled to one-half of any recovery for the wrongful death of such a child. If he should fail to do so, then he would be entitled to nothing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b544-16\">252 Ga. at 532, 314 S.E.2d 879 (citations omitted). Application of this standard to the present case requires little discussion. Pickett was an unemployed teenager when she gave birth to Carlus, and she received government assistance in raising him. In a handwritten affidavit, Slappey stated \u201cI did not pay any of the expenses of raising Andrew Carlus Oates,\u201d and he conceded in deposition that he was employed for most of Carlus\u2019 life. In short, Slappey clearly failed to provide reasonable financial support for his son as discussed in <em>Solomon, </em>and as a result he is not entitled to share in a recovery for the child\u2019s wrongful death. The district court properly denied the motion to intervene. <em>See Athens Lumber Co. v. Federal Election Commission, </em>690 F.2d 1364 (11th Cir.1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b544-17\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
