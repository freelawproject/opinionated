The statute provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1434-14\">Notwithstanding any other provision of law, any petition for review must be filed within 30 days after the date the petitioner received notice of the final order or decision of the Board.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1434-15\">The MSPB order denying petitioner\u2019s request for review was received by him on October 11, 1983, and by his attorney on October 14, 1983. The petition for review by this Court was received by the Clerk on November 14, 1983. Under the statute, the date of receipt by petitioner\u2019s counsel is irrelevant where petitioner himself actually received notice. Receipt of notice by petitioner on October 11 triggered the statute of limitations and his appeal is late on its face. The 30-day period for appeal is statutory, mandatory, jurisdictional, and bars the claim here. <em>Ramos v. United States, </em>683 F.2d 396 (Ct.Cl.1982). Rule 26(c) of the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure, which allows three extra days after \u201cservice of a paper\u201d by mail, is not relevant to this case where the statute speaks of notice. Cf<em>. </em>FED.R.APP.P. 25(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b1434-17\">IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED that respondent\u2019s motion to dismiss is granted.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
