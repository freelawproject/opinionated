Platt, Jr., Judge, which affirmed a determination by the appellee Secretary of Health and Human Services that P\u00e1rente was no longer disabled, and hence no longer entitled to the Social Security disability benefits which appellant had received since the Secretary had first found her disabled in 1976. Based on our recent holding in <em>De Leon v. Secretary, </em>734 F.2d 930 (2d Cir.1984), that \u201cthe Secretary may terminate [disability] benefits to a person previously adjudged to be disabled only upon substantial evidence that the individual\u2019s condition has improved to the point that he or she is no longer disabled, or that the initial finding of disability was erroneous,\u201d we reverse. It is abundantly clear from the administrative record that the Secretary made absolutely no determination that there was any improvement or even change in appellant\u2019s physical or psychological condition, but merely conducted what amounted to a de novo hearing on the question of disability. Irrespective of the Secretary\u2019s most recent determination, there can be no doubt that P\u00e1rente has long suffered from serious physical and emotional disorders. In 1976 she applied for and was granted Social Security disability benefits due to \u201cemotional and various physical problems.\u201d Prior to 1976 appellant had been treated for an ovarian cyst. At the time the cyst was removed, appellant also had a pancreatic tumor removed, and a hysterectomy was performed. Appellant was, and continues to be, extremely obese; she is 5 feet 3 inches tall and weighs over 300 pounds, at one time being up to 347. She cannot lean over to pick up things. She has trouble breathing. She climbs stairs one by one. On September 8, 1981, she was hospitalized with a pleural effusion, possibly indicating heart difficulty. She has edema in her legs from her knees to her ankles, increased by standing. She is frequently nauseous and has ileitis.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-7\">But as the 1976 proceeding made clear, even more disabling than appellant\u2019s physical ailments were her psychological and emotional problems. A social worker\u2019s 1976 report in support of Parente\u2019s application for benefits described her as having \u201ca thought disorder, probably schizophrenia, paranoid type.\u201d The social worker observed that P\u00e1rente has \u201cvery few friends ____ In addition, her appearance is extremely poor, she is disheveled and unkempt. She suffers from paranoid ideation and loose association ____ Insight and judgment are poor____\u201d Though she had worked from 1951 to 1970, appellant had been unemployed for six years when her application for benefits was granted in 1976. She has not worked since that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-11\">In October, 1981, the Social Security Administration notified appellant that, pursuant to its \u201cAccelerated CDI (Continuing Disability Investigation) Program,\u201d it intended to terminate her benefits. While recognizing appellant\u2019s exogenous obesity, the appellee\u2019s position, based on the examinations of a psychiatrist and an internist, was that \u201c[t]he impairment does not meet or equal the level of severity described in the Listing of Impairments.\u201d The appellee concluded that \u201c[b]ased on the medical evidence [P\u00e1rente] retains the capacity to perform simple, repetitive tasks,\u201d and was thus no longer disabled.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-12\">It is very debatable whether there was substantial evidence on the record to support the ALJ\u2019s finding that appellant is not disabled, an issue we need not reach but about which we have grave doubts, especially in light of his failure to discuss the opinion of her treating physician. <em>Eche-varria v. Secretary of Health and Human Services, </em>685 F.2d 751, 756 (2d Cir.1982). But it is clear that the AU made no effort whatsoever \u2014 other than to include some predictable boilerplate \u2014 to determine whether her condition had improved. We note, for example, that although the AU did recognize that the initial determination of disability was based on appellant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"745\">*745</page-number>\u201cschizophrenia, paranoid type,\u201d no evidence was even presented at the hearing that this condition or disability had been alleviated. In this area the AU relied on a psychiatric evaluation performed by a consulting psychiatrist \u201cwho reported a transient situational disturbance\u201d and who, despite offering appellant \u201ca good prognosis,\u201d also recommended that she see a psychiatrist on a regular basis. The doctor did not address the question whether he believed appellant was suffering from schizophrenia, let alone offer any evidence of an improvement in her condition. While the doctor did indicate on a form that appellant\u2019s impairments in various areas were \u201cmoderate\u201d rather than \u201csevere,\u201d we note that he also stated that appellant\u2019s capacity to \u201cmeet production, quality and attendance standards\u201d was, based on his examination, \u201cseverely impaired.\u201d We note also that the designation of a \u201cmoderate\u201d impairment on the form provided the consultant psychiatrist\u2014 which the Secretary would have us believe is strong evidence of a lack of a disability\u2014 must be read in context of the range of choices provided to the doctor who is called upon to categorize an impairment: \u201cNone,\u201d \u201cMild,\u201d \u201cModerate,\u201d \u201cSevere.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b843-5\">We need not repeat what we said in <em>De Leon </em>except to emphasize that first to classify a claimant as disabled and then draw precisely the opposite legal conclusion without substantial evidence of improvement violates not only the termination statute but basic considerations of fairness. As that is what we are confronted with in this ease, the decision below is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-6\">Judgment reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
