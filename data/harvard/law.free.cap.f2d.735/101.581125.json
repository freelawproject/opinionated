Hubert I. Teitelbaum, United States District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b201-20\">OPINION OF THE COURT</p>\n<author id=\"b201-21\">ADAMS, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b201-22\">This appeal comes to us from the trial of Sanford Storm and Jerome Ashfield, two business associates who were charged with attempted evasion of personal income taxes. After a jury returned guilty verdicts against each defendant, the trial court sustained Storm\u2019s conviction, but ruled that the evidence against Ashfield was insufficient and entered a judgment of acquittal in his favor. On appeal, a careful examination of the record leaves us satisfied that Storm\u2019s conviction should be affirmed. We are, however, compelled to differ with the trial court\u2019s weighing of the evidence against Ashfield. While the record here, as with most white-collar crimes, consists of a complex web of inferential proof, we are persuaded that the evidence is sufficient to support the jury\u2019s verdict against Ashfield. We therefore reverse the judgment of acquittal for Ashfield and affirm the conviction of Storm.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-23\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-24\">Storm and Ashfield are the sole shareholders and officers of National Talent As<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>sociates (NTA), a closely held corporation that placed child models for television, magazine and catalog advertising. NTA essentially acted as a referral service for another, larger talent agency. After locating interested parents by direct mail, NTA would select suitable children, execute a 5-year contract with the parents, photograph the aspiring child model, and send the picture to the Schuller Talent Agency, which would in turn accept about one in twenty referrals and arrange job interviews for them. For this service, NTA charged a one-time fee of $135 to $165 when the contract was signed. Thereafter, NTA received a commission of 10% of a child\u2019s earnings up to $1000, and 15% of any additional earnings.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-4\">NTA established two corporate bank accounts. The first, the management trust account, was the repository for compensation paid by employers for the work of the child models. From these payments, NTA deducted its commission and sent a check-for the remainder to the client. NTA\u2019s commission earnings were then transferred to the second corporate account, the operating account.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">Within NTA\u2019s operating account were various categories such as commission income (the 10% or 15% fees transferred from the management trust account), sales income (the $135 to $165 one-time registration fee), and officers\u2019 loans receivable (outlays and repayments for personal expenses of Storm and Ashfield).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> All payments to the operating account were credited as sales income, unless specifically designated for deposit to some other category.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-6\">During an audit of NTA, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) discovered that between 1973 and 1975 almost $60,000 from the trust account was deposited in the officers\u2019 loans account and credited in equal amounts to Storm and Ashfield as repayment of personal loans. As a result of these loan repayments, each defendant in effect received $30,000 in dividends that twice escaped taxation. Because the deposits were never listed as income to NTA, no corporate tax was paid on them, and because the deposits were never reported as income to Storm and Ashfield, no personal tax was paid on them.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-10\">In April 1982, Storm and Ashfield were indicted on eight counts of evading corporate and personal income tax in 1974 and 1975. Six of the eight counts were, however, dismissed as barred by the statute of limitations, leaving only two counts in place: one count each for Storm and Ash-field for attempted evasion of personal income tax in 1975.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b202-11\">At trial, the defendants did not contest that the loan repayments had been incorrectly credited to them. Rather, the defense asserted lack of \u201cwillfulness\u201d on the part of Storm and Ashfield. In particular, Storm attempted to show through cross-examination of the government\u2019s witnesses that the repayments were erroneously recorded because of a mistake by NTA\u2019s accounting firm. Ashfield's defense was that he had no control over NTA\u2019s accounting practices and that he was unaware of the errors. Neither Storm nor Ashfield took the stand, and no other witness testified on behalf of the defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-12\">On February 9, 1983, the jury returned a guilty verdict against each defendant. But on April 11, 1983, the district court granted a motion for acquittal of Ashfield, ruling that \u201creasonable minds could not have concluded that all of the elements of the crime charged were established beyond a reasonable doubt____\u201d App. at 44a. The district court, however, left in place the jury\u2019s guilty verdict against Storm, and on May <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>19, 1983, sentenced him to 90 days imprisonment, three years probation, and a $5000 fine. Timely appeals were filed by Storm, by the government (appealing Ashfield\u2019s acquittal) and by Ashfield (defensively cross-appealing the trial court\u2019s denial of his motion for a new trial).</p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">Although both defendants assert that the district court committed errors requiring us to order a new trial, the central issue before us is the sufficiency of the evidence against Storm and, particularly, against Ashfield. Because a ruling that the proof adduced at trial was inadequate would be dispositive of both of the defendants\u2019 appeals, we consider that issue first.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-7\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-8\">To establish guilt of tax evasion under 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 7201 (West Supp.1983), the government must show: (1) the existence of a tax deficiency, (2) an affirmative act constituting an attempted evasion of payment of taxes, and (3) willfulness. <em>Sansone v. United States, </em>380 U.S. 343, 351, 85 S.Ct. 1004, 1010, 13 L.Ed.2d 882 (1965). Neither Storm nor Ashfield challenge the proof of the first two elements'of the crime; they contest only the proof of the last element \u2014 willfulness.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-9\">For purposes of \u00a7 7201, willfulness is defined as the voluntary, intentional violation of a known legal duty. <em>See U.S. v. Pomponio, </em>429 U.S. 10, 11-13, 97 S.Ct. 22, 23-24, 50 L.Ed.2d 12 (1976) (per curiam); <em>U.S. v. Bishop, </em>412 U.S. 346, 359-60, 93 S.Ct. 2008, 2016-17, 36 L.Ed.2d 941 (1973). Willfulness, may however, be inferred from circumstantial evidence. The Supreme Court has made clear that willful tax evasion may be proven by a consistent \u2022 pattern of underreporting large amounts of income and by the taxpayer\u2019s failure to include all his income on his books and records. <em>Holland v. U.S., </em>348 U.S. 121, 139, 75 S.Ct. 127, 137, 99 L.Ed. 150 (1954). <em>See Spies v. U.S., </em>317 U.S. 492, 499, 63 S.Ct. 364, 368, 87 L.Ed. 418 (1942). Likewise in this circuit, we have often held that repetitious conduct resulting in underpayment of taxes may be sufficient to show willfulness. <em>U.S. v. Alker, </em>260 F.2d 135, 148 (3d Cir.1958) (\u201cconsistent understatement [of tax liability] is evidence of willfulness\u201d); <em>U.S. v. Frank, </em>245 F.2d 284, 287-88 (3d Cir.1957) (proof of a consistent pattern of underreporting \u201cis itself enough\u201d to sustain a jury finding of willful tax evasion). <em>See also U.S. v. Greenlee, </em>517 F.2d 899, 903 (3d Cir.1975) (\u201ca two year pattern of derelictions ... [is] itself indicative of the willfulness\u201d). Recently, our Court reversed a decision to acquit an accused tax evader, holding that the evidence was sufficient given the proof of a long-run pattern of reporting at variance with the taxpayer\u2019s defense, the substantiality of the sums the taxpayer failed to report, and the number of times taxpayer received income checks he claimed to have forgotten. <em>U.S. v. Doan, </em>710 F.2d 124, 126 (3d Cir.1983). Obviously, these decisions pertaining to the permissible scope of a jury\u2019s inferences from circumstantial evidence are necessarily fact-intensive and therefore not subject to easy generalization. Nonetheless, it is clear that a jury may find a defendant\u2019s tax evasion was willful wholly on the basis of inferential proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-11\">In the case at hand, the jury was carefully instructed on the meaning of willfulness. The court explained that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A8lq\">in this case the attempt to evade or defeat the tax must be a willful attempt, that is to say it must be an attempt made voluntarily and intentionally and with specific intent to keep from the government a tax imposed by the income tax laws which it was the legal duty of the defendants to pay to the government and which the defendants knew it was their legal duty to pay.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b203-12\">App. at 895a. Having heard this definition as well as seven days of testimony, the jury found that both Ashfield and Storm were guilty of the crime charged in their indictment \u2014 that is, that they \u201cdid knowingly and willfully attempt to evade and defeat a large part of the income tax due <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>and owing ... to the United States.\u201d App. at 891a; <em>see </em>App. at 892a, 910a-911a.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-4\">Given those verdicts, the trial court\u2019s ruling on the sufficiency of the evidence is governed by strict principles of deference to a jury\u2019s findings. In deciding whether to grant the motions for acquittal, the trial court was required to view the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution and to draw all reasonable inferences therefrom in the government\u2019s favor. <em>See Glasser v. U.S., </em>315 U.S. 60, 80, 62 S.Ct. 457, 469, 86 L.Ed. 680 (1942); <em>U.S. v. Jannotti, </em>673 F.2d 578, 598 (3d Cir.1982) (in banc). Viewing the evidence in this light, the trial court was obliged to uphold the jury\u2019s verdict unless no rational jury could conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendants willfully attempted to evade their tax obligations. <em>See Burks v. U.S., </em>437 U.S. 1, 16-17, 98 S.Ct. 2141, 2149-50, 57 L.Ed.2d 1 (1978); <em>Doan, supra, </em>710 F.2d at 127; <em>Jannotti, supra, </em>673 F.2d at 598.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">In our review of the sufficiency of the evidence, we must apply the same standard of deference to the jury\u2019s findings. <em>See Burks, supra, </em>437 U.S. at 17, 98 S.Ct. at 2150; <em>U.S. v. Dixon, </em>658 F.2d 181, 188 (3d Cir.1981). Thus, we must independently re-examine the record and determine as a matter of law whether the evidence could support an inference of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>See Jannotti, supra, </em>673 F.2d at 598. Our task is not to decide what we would conclude had we been the finders of fact; instead, we are limited to determining whether the conclusion chosen by the factfinders was permissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-6\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-7\">After hearing argument on Storm\u2019s motion for acquittal, the district court announced that \u201cthere was more than ample evidence in the record to justify the jurors in determining and assessing guilt of Mr. Storm beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d App. at 994. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-8\">As the officer in charge of NTA\u2019s bookkeeping, Storm was responsible for producing the financial records which were in turn used by NTA\u2019s accounting firm to prepare the corporation's tax returns. App. at 174a, 234a. Most importantly, Storm\u2019s bookkeeping .duties included the task of filling out the internal deposit slips. These slips designated the source of money being deposited in NTA\u2019s operating account and the particular category of the operating account \u2014 such as officers\u2019 loans or commission income \u2014 to which the money was to be credited. App. at 240a, 242a, 337a, 342a. Under NTA\u2019s accounting practices, unidentified deposits were treated as sales income. App. at 241a. The accountants could not credit a deposit to any category other than sales income without an express designation on the internal deposit slip or specific instructions from Storm himself. App. at 244a-45a, 342a, 419a, 421a, 436a. Consequently, any deposit credited as a repayment to the officers\u2019 loans account had to be requested \u2014 directly or indirectly \u2014 by Storm.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-10\">Between 1973 and 1975, a series of repayments to the officers\u2019 loan account followed a consistent pattern. In 1975, checks for $20,000 and $8,000 were drawn from the management trust account and deposited in the operating account as officers\u2019 loan repayments, divided equally between Storm and Ashfield. App. at 482a, 647a, 730a. In 1974, by the same procedure, $9,000 and then $6,000 from the trust account were credited as loan repayments. App. at 526a, 660a, 662a, 665a. Likewise in 1973, $6,500 and then $10,000 were transferred from the trust account to the loan account. App. at 661a-65a. For three consecutive years, therefore, the same method was used to understate the corporate income of NTA and the personal income of the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-11\">In view of Storm\u2019s control of the NTA books and especially the designation of deposits to the officers\u2019 loan account, a rational jury could conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that the three-year pattern of misreported loan repayments was the product of a voluntary and intentional effort by Storm to evade payment of taxes. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>When we consider, in addition, certain other inculpatory facts, we must conclude that the evidence against Storm rises well above the level necessary to sustain a guilty verdiet. Storm had taught accounting, App. at 686a, and accordingly there can be little question that he understood the implications of crediting a deposit as an officers loan repayment. More significantly, there is evidence that Storm sought to conceal the records pertaining to the management trust account and thereby arguably evinced consciousness of the impropriety of using commission earnings to repay officers Bef\u00b0r! t\u00edeiIRS a^\u00ed\u2019 n\u00b0ne \u00b0f NTA s accountants knew of the manage- , , , , <em>\u00b0 </em>ment trust account or of the separate ledger maintained for it. App. at 325a, 331a. When the IRS served a summons on NTA requesting all financial records, Storm produced no document containing any reference to the trust account and, through his attorney, claimed that the production was complete. App. at 689a-90a. Placed alongside the other evidence, this evidence of attempted concealment by a person trained in bookkeeping confirms that the district court properly denied Storm\u2019s motion for acquittal.</p>\n<p id=\"A1D\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"ADYb\">Less compelling is the evidence against Ashfield because, in contrast to Storm, he did not directly participate in preparing NTA\u2019s bookkeeping entries. Nevertheless, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the government, as we must, we believe that the record was sufficient to sustain the jury\u2019s guilty verdict against Ashfield.</p>\n<p id=\"AbI\">The district judge reached the opposite conclusion in a brief oral opinion that relies on <em>U.S. v. Forrest, </em>620 F.2d 446 (5th Cir.1980)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> By focusing on the <em>Forrest </em>cas6) the district judge intimated his concern that Ashf\u00edeld wag convicted merely on the bagig of his c]ose business association with Storm&lt; In Aorresi&gt; the Fifth Circuit held ^ a wife,g ilt knowledge could not be inferred gimp]y from the fact that ghe wag married to the ki in of a iarge.Scale illegal operation. 620 F.2d at 451. The <em>For- </em>, , , . , <em>rest </em>court emphasized:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AUe\">, . . . , . , , That \u00b0ne 18 maraed,t0\u2019 associatf with, or m *e company of a criminal does not suPPort Terence that that person is a \u2122al or shares the mminal s ^ now e ^e'</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ACu\">Id. (footnotes omitted). We do not take exception with this statement; rather we believe that the evidence of Ashfield\u2019s participation in a tax evasion scheme goes well beyond a mere professional association wbh Storm.</p>\n<p id=\"A0_\">Between 1973 and 1975, Ashfield borrowed $29,000 of corporate funds and spent it for such personal expenses as tuition payments for his child at Rider College and individual income tax payments to the IRS. App. at 532a, 534a. For a person whose maximum reported income during this three-year period reached approximately $41,000 in 1975, App. at 675a, these loans <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>from NTA were not negligible. The jury could reasonably infer that Ashfield was aware of his substantial personal indebtedness to the corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-4\">To repay this debt legally, Ashfield should have deposited funds from his personal, after-tax income in NTA\u2019s operating account and designated these deposits as repayments to his loan account. Ashfield did this only once, however, during the period 1973-75. In 1975, he endorsed a $4,000 salary check \u2014 from which tax had been withheld \u2014 and deposited it as a loan repayment. App. at 750a-51a. From this evidence, a rational jury could infer that Ashfield knew the proper method to be employed in repaying his loans from NTA.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">In contrast to this one legal repayment of $4,000, the record shows that from 1973 to 1975 seven deposits totalling almost $60,000 were transferred from the trust account and credited one-half to Ashfield as loan repayments. App. at 674a-82a. This repetition of a particular transaction whereby corporate funds were used to repay the officers\u2019 personal debts would support an inference that the deposits were being misreported by plan, not by accident. The question left open by this pattern of misreporting is whether Ashfield willfully participated in the arrangement, either by affirmative act or by tacit approval.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-6\">When we consider the record as a whole, we are persuaded, based on the inferential proof, that a jury could rationally conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that Ashfield at least tacitly approved of his fellow officer\u2019s tax evasion scheme. The record links Ash-field to one of the series of transactions by which the tax evasion scheme was implemented. In 1973, Ashfield wrote a $6,500 check on the trust account and deposited it in the operating account as a loan repayment, equally divided between him and Storm. App. at 661a. Each of the other six transfers of NTA income from the trust account to the officers\u2019 loan account during 1973-75 were evenly divided between Ash-field and Storm. Since nothing in the evidence indicates that NTA\u2019s accounting system ordinarily required the officers to repay their loans in equal and simultaneous sums, the jury could infer that the loan repayments were being shared intentionally. It seems improbable that Ashfield\u2019s business associate would be so scrupulously honest about splitting the profits of the tax evasion scheme if Ashfield were unaware of its existence. This inference is strengthened by the evidence that these loan repayments permitted Ashfield to escape a substantial proportion of his personal income tax during 1973-75, rising from nineteen per cent in 1973, to twenty per cent in 1974, and to thirty-six per cent in 1975. App. at 676a, 678a, 682a. These do not appear to be the sort of insignificant amounts that an experienced business executive would easily overlook.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-8\">Our review of this evidence is further influenced by Ashfield\u2019s substantial role in the management of a successful enterprise. Since its incorporation in 1969, Ashfield was a fifty per cent shareholder and one of the two officers of NTA, a firm that realized gross income exceeding $452,000 in 1975. App. at 608a. As the corporation\u2019s vice president, Ashfield\u2019s responsibilities included supervising NTA\u2019s pension plan and investments. App. at 336a, 768a. Moreover, although Ashfield did not prepare NTA\u2019s bookkeeping records, he did attend financial meetings with the accountants. App. at 190a-91a, 324a-26a. At none of the meetings did he disclose the existence of the trust account. When he filled out a tax preparation questionnaire from the firm\u2019s accountants, Ashfield certified that there was no income other than that disclosed on the records of NTA\u2019s operating account. App. at 296a-98a, 764a-65a.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-9\">When Ashfield\u2019s managerial and ownership role at NTA is viewed alongside all the evidence of his profitable involvement with the officers\u2019 loan account, we believe that the record is adequate to support a jury finding that Ashfield willfully participated in a tax evasion scheme. The district court\u2019s judgment of acquittal must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>therefore be reversed. We do not, however, mean by this holding to foreclose the district court from reconsidering Ashfield\u2019s motion for a new trial. The district judge denied that motion \u201cfor the record,\u201d App. at 45a, without stating his reasons and immediately after granting Ashfield an acquittal. Consequently, his ruling may have been premised on the view that the acquittal mooted the motion for a new trial. Given our decision today, and the fact that the district judge\u2019s focus on <em>U.S. v. Forrest, </em>620 F.2d 446 (5th Cir.1980), may indicate his concern that the jury\u2019s deliberations were tainted by the spillover effect of evidence against Storm, we expressly leave open to the district court, in its discretion, the option of considering a renewed motion for a new trial of Ashfield. <em>Cf. U.S. v. Dixon, </em>658 F.2d 181, 193 (3d Cir.1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-6\">Having determined that the evidence was sufficient to support the guilty verdicts rendered against both defendants, we turn to Storm and Ashfield\u2019s<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> assertion that during their trial the district court committed reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-7\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-8\">The defendants claim that the district court erroneously excluded a hearsay statement suggesting that the misreporting of income occurred by mistake. Specifically, the defense sought at trial to establish that Irwin Giblen, owner of NTA\u2019s accounting firm (Giblen &amp; Co.), had characterized the treatment of the loan repayments as an \u201caccounting error.\u201d Because Giblen died prior to trial, this comment could be admitted only as a \u201cstatement against interest\u201d under Fed.R.Evid. 804(b)(3). After a special hearing on admissibility, the trial court ruled that this comment, at least as recalled by accountant Donald Smith, was not a statement against interest and was therefore inadmissible hearsay. Storm and Ash-field contend that this ruling constitutes an incorrect application of the rules of evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-11\">At the hearing held to determine the admissibility of the Giblen hearsay statement, Smith testified that prior to meeting with an IRS agent to discuss the investigation, he received instructions from Giblen as to \u201chow to deal with the revenue agent.\u201d App. at 441a. Smith at first maintained that Giblen told him to say \u201can accounting error had been made,\u201d and that \u201can accountant had made a mistake.\u201d App. at 439a. But on cross-examination, Smith conceded that the \u201caccounting error\u201d explanation \u201cmay well have come from either Mr. Storm or Mr. Ashfield,\u201d App. at 446a, and finally acknowledged that no one other than Storm and Ashfield \u201cwould know whether there was an error.\u201d App. at 449a.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-12\">Following this hearing, the trial court found that \u201cbasically ... [Giblen\u2019s statement] is a position that is going to be taken with the IRS.\u201d App. at 453a. More importantly, the judge found that the statement was \u201cnot one which Mr. Giblen was necessarily adopting or endorsing or vouching for as being true.\u201d App. at 455a. Based on these findings,- the court determined that Giblen\u2019s statement was not a statement against interest \u201ceither of himself or his company.\u201d App. at 453a.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-13\">Rule 804(b)(3). provides that an out-of-court statement by an unavailable witness is admissible if it was</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ASi\">at the time of its making so far contrary to the declarant\u2019s pecuniary or proprietary interest, or so far tended to subject him to civil or criminal liability ... that a reasonable man in his position would not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>have made the statement unless he believed it to be true.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b208-4\">Thus, an essential predicate for applying this rule is that the hearsay be objectively contrary to the declarant\u2019s interest. In the case before us, the district court concluded that this prerequisite was lacking. Because, in the court\u2019s view, Giblen failed to \u201cadopt[] or endors[e] or vouch[ ] for\u201d the explanation, his statement was not objectively contrary to his interest and therefore did not satisfy Rule 804(b)(3)\u2019s threshold requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-5\">Reviewing this determination under the abuse of discretion standard, we are satisfied that the trial court properly exercised his discretion in excluding the Giblen hearsay. Two factors undergird our conclusion. First, Giblen\u2019s comment was so general that it never expressly assumed responsibility by a Giblen &amp; Co. accountant: no accountant was named and no particular error was identified.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Second, Giblen made his statement after his firm had begun to act as a representative of Storm and Ashfield in the IRS investigation. In such capacity Giblen seems to have been serving as a conduit for defenses suggested by his clients.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-6\">The defendants have suggested that the trial judge\u2019s exclusion of this hearsay is at odds with his decision to admit another Giblen hearsay statement. Allen Stockel-berg, the second-in-command at Giblen &amp; Co., was permitted to testify about Giblen\u2019s comments after an evidentiary hearing at which he reported Giblen as saying \u201cwe had fouled up.\u201d App. at 207a.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> As we view this statement, it differs substantially from the excluded comments in that it approaches a direct and personal assumption of responsibility by Giblen &amp; Co.\u2019s owner. Certainly the district judge acted within his discretion in admitting this statement while excluding Donald Smith\u2019s recollection of Gi-blen\u2019s other comments.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-9\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-10\">Storm and Ashfield also maintain that the district court erred in refusing to grant a mistrial in order that the law firm representing Storm could withdraw from the case and one of its attorneys could take the stand. The defendants assert that the significance of the lawyer\u2019s testimony was not apparent until the government surprised them at trial with unexpected evidence that the lawyer could rebut and that the court\u2019s decision not to grant a mistrial effectively deprived them of their right to present a complete defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-11\">The issue arose when, at trial, an IRS special agent testified about a September 1978 meeting with Storm and his attorney, Jerome Miller. Storm was supposed to produce all of NTA\u2019s financial records for 1973-75, and, according to the special agent, Storm claimed that he had indeed produced all the documents required by the IRS summons. The IRS later discovered, through NTA\u2019s bank, that records for the management trust account were <em>not </em>produced, and this discovery ultimately led to the uncovering of the illegal loan repayments.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-12\">When the testimony regarding the missing documents was introduced, Storm moved for a mistrial. Storm argued that because Miller\u2019s law firm represented him at trial, and because Disciplinary Rules 5-101 and 5-102 of the Model Code of Professional Responsibility (1979) prevented Miller from testifying in a case in which his firm acted as counsel, a mistrial was necessary to permit Storm to retain new counsel and to put Miller on the stand to impeach <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>the special agent\u2019s report of the September 1978 meeting. The trial court refused to grant a mistrial, declaring that Storm\u2019s attorneys had \u201cfully discharged their obligation\u201d and that they fell under an exception to the rule because they were \u201cnow so completely immersed in this case\u201d that they would \u201csurely [provide] the most effective representation.\u201d App. at 628a-629a. Despite these assurances from the judge, the defense chose not to call Miller to the stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">The district court\u2019s decision not to order a new trial because of this development was proper for two reasons. First, assuming that Storm was indeed surprised at trial by the special agent\u2019s testimony, the district court properly invoked an exception to the disciplinary rules. Although ordinarily a lawyer must withdraw from representation of a client when \u201cit is obvious that ... a lawyer in his firm will be called as a witness on behalf of his client,\u201d Model Code, <em>supra, </em>DR 5-102(A), the Model Code permits an attorney to continue \u201c[a]s to any matter, if refusal would work a substantial hardship on the client because of the distinctive value of the lawyer or his firm as counsel in a particular case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at DR 5-101(B). We agree with the district court that in view of the longtime involvement of Miller\u2019s law firm, both in the IRS investigation and in the trial preparation, the firm\u2019s withdrawal would have worked a \u201csubstantial hardship\u201d on Storm.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-6\">Second, and more importantly, the record demonstrates that the defense had reason to know the September 1978 meeting might be brought up at trial. Far from being a \u201cbooby trap\u201d \u2014 the term used in Storm\u2019s brief \u2014 the testimony by the IRS special agent was brought to the defense\u2019s attention with adequate time to prepare a response. Well before trial, the government sent the special agent\u2019s memorandum of the September 1978 meeting to the defense as part of the <em>Brady </em>production. Once again during pretrial evidentiary rulings, the government moved to introduce Miller\u2019s statement during the September 1978 meeting as an adoptive admission of Storm. In light of these early warnings, we believe the government fairly characterizes Miller\u2019s failure to testify as a \u201ctactical decision.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b209-8\">The defendants argue that they should have been specifically put on notice about the special agent\u2019s testimony on three other occasions: (1) when the prosecution moved to disqualify Miller\u2019s law firm; (2) when the prosecution moved for admission of a memorandum containing statements by Miller about the document production; and (3) when the prosecution agreed with Storm to stipulate to admission of NTA financial records without calling a document custodian. But this catalog of purported \u201cconcealment\u201d by the government simply reaffirms the conclusion that, despite Miller\u2019s extensive involvement in the IRS investigation, and despite the innumerable points on which he could have testified, the defense intentionally chose to keep Miller\u2019s firm in the case. The September 1978 meeting was anything but an isolated \u201cbooby trap\u201d; the prosecution\u2019s evidence was replete with such encounters. Having made the decision to use Miller\u2019s firm nonetheless, the defense is not persuasive in its contention that we should order a new trial to be conducted by other counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-9\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-10\">Storm and Ashfield\u2019s final claim of trial error arises from a statement by the prosecutor that they insist constitutes a comment on the defendants\u2019 failure to take the stand. In his rebuttal summation, the Assistant United States Attorney stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-11\">Sure trust accounts are common in business. There is nothing wrong with having a trust account. It is part and parcel of a business where you have client income. You heard no explanation of the reason why it was necessary to keep such a trust account secret except to avoid payment of taxes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b210-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>App. at 872a. Defense moved for a mistrial and curative instruction, but the judge ruled that \u201cI didn\u2019t find anything offensive\u201d and \u201cI don\u2019t feel there is the likelihood of the jury drawing an improper inference.\u201d App. at 874a-875a. The judge gave only the standard cautionary instruction about not drawing inferences from a defendant\u2019s failure to testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-4\">In the circumstances of this case, we do not believe this comment required a mistrial. The \u201cexplanation\u201d for the secrecy could have come from a number of witnesses. Trust accounts were discussed at length during the testimony of several Giblen &amp; Co. accountants and a talent agency employee, and an explanation for the secrecy surrounding NTA\u2019s trust account could have been extracted from them if the defense so chose. Thus, when the prosecution asked rhetorically why no explanation was proffered, the question might just as well have referred to persons who took the stand. Since it was far from clear that the prosecutor\u2019s statement referred to the defendants, we believe that the judge acted within the scope of his discretion in refusing a mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-6\">On behalf of Ashfield alone, it is asserted that the district judge erroneously denied a post-verdict motion for a new trial based on the discovery of an accountant\u2019s workpaper containing the notation \u201c7500 \u2014 each officer was withdrawn to personal name from escrow account.\u201d According to Ashfield, the discovery of this document required a new trial because the notation proved that NTA\u2019s accountants knew of the existence of the management trust account, and therefore supported the claim that the underpayment of taxes resulted from an accounting error. To prevail on a motion for a new trial based on newly discovered evidence, a defendant bears the heavy burden of establishing five requirements: the evidence must be newly discovered; facts must be alleged from which the court may infer diligence on the part of the movant; the evidence must not be merely cumulative or impeaching; it must be material to the issues; and it must be such that, on a new trial, it would probably produce an acquittal. <em>U.S. v. Rocco, ' </em>587 F.2d 144, 146 (3d Cir.1978). We have carefully considered the document as well as the record on the basis of this exacting standard. In view of Ashfield\u2019s limited showing of diligence and failure to demonstrate that this new evidence would probably produce an acquittal, we are satisfied that the district judge properly exercised his discretion in refusing Ashfield a new trial on the ground of this newly discovered document.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-9\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-10\">The judgment of conviction against Storm will be affirmed. The judgment of acquittal in favor of Ashfield will be reversed, and Ashfield\u2019s ease will be remanded to the district court for action consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b202-7\">.
