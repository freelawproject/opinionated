Adams, Gary S. Bar-acco, and others (Adams) by the Department of Transportation\u2019s Federal Aviation Administration (agency) from their positions as Air Traffic Control Specialists. The bases for removal constituted proven charges of striking against the United States and absence without leave. We <em>affirm.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b587-20\">\n<em>Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b587-21\">The reader of this opinion is referred to this court\u2019s opinion accompanying its decision in <em>Schapansky v. Department of Transportation, FAA, </em>735 F.2d 477 (Fed.Cir.1984) issued of even date. The discussion in <em>Schapansky </em>of facts and issues common to that case and this are adopted and incorporated in this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-22\">Except for instances in which a petitioner is identified by name, \u201cAdams\u201d should be read as applicable to all petitioners in these present appeals.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b587-23\">Issues raised by Adams and <em>Amici </em>and differing in substance or detail from those discussed in <em>Schapansky </em>are discussed in this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-24\">Unlike Schapansky, petitioners here made no oral response to the notice of removal and were not shown to have voted for the strike. Only Baracco was shown to have engaged in picketing. Each present petitioner received an agency letter proposing removal for strike participation and absence without leave. Each responded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>only by submitting union (PATCO) prepared forms requesting time enlargements and production of documents. No petitioner denied the charges.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> No petitioner requested opportunity for oral response, beyond the requests for extension of time to answer \u201cin writing and orally\u201d. Nor did any petitioner testify before either the agency or the Board. Other fact differences will appear in the course of discussion on the issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-4\">\n<em>Issues</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b588-5\">(1) Whether government officials created such confusion concerning the Presidential deadline and controller\u2019s ability to return to duty as to have prevented formation of an intent to strike.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-6\">(2) Whether the Board properly drew an adverse inference from petitioners\u2019 failure to testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-7\">(3) Whether the agency unlawfully suspended petitioners during agency proceedings by placing them in a non-duty, non-pay status without following \u2018 the procedures of 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7513.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-8\">(4) Whether the Board correctly found that the strike lasted at least through August 19, 1981.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b588-13\">OPINION</p>\n<p id=\"b588-14\">(1) <em>Alleged Confusion</em></p>\n<p id=\"A_o\">Adams\u2019 brief contends that the President\u2019s announcement and agency actions respecting controllers\u2019 ability to avoid removal by returning to work were so confusing that controllers were unable to form an intent to strike. Petitioners have not told the agency, the Board, or this court what their intent was in absenting themselves from work throughout the time of the strike. Nor have they pointed to any evidence upon which anything but an intent to strike may be found, or which might counter the circumstantial evidence establishing an intent to strike.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-15\">The President announced at 11:00 a.m., E.D.T., on August 3, 1981, that controllers then striking who did not report for duty within 48 hours would forfeit their positions and \u201cwill be\u201d terminated. Because of differences in shift schedules and time zones, the agency allowed controllers to return to work at the time of regularly-scheduled shifts that began after 11:00 a.m., on August 5, 1981.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-16\">The briefs say controllers thought they had been fired when they did not report to work before 11:00 a.m. on August 5, 1981, and thus \u201ccould not\u201d take advantage of the permission to return at the time of their first regularly-scheduled shift fol<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>lowing that ending of the President\u2019s grace period. The argument is disingenuous. First, the President\u2019s announcement terminated no one, least of all nonstrikers. Second, petitioners\u2019 briefs do not explain why they did not, as did 1200 other controllers, report <em>before </em>11:00 a.m. on August 5, 1981, or why they did not notify the agency at any time before their next scheduled shifts that they were not on strike, or why they did not simply report and announce their readiness to work at the time of their scheduled shifts, \u00ab/they had no intention of striking at any of those times.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-4\">None of the present petitioners testified that he was confused. Nor is there any evidence whatever that any controller was confused.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Apparently recognizing the impossibility of an agency\u2019s proving what was in an employee\u2019s mind, Adams\u2019 brief concedes that intent can be shown by circumstantial evidence. It makes no effort, however, to blunt the thrust of the view that a controller absent at commencement of the strike, but truly not intending to participate in it, would, promptly upon hearing or hearing of the President\u2019s announcement, contact the agency and relieve it of any presumption that his absence was in any manner related to the strike. Petitioners alone knew their true intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-5\">Nor is there a logical, common sense basis for believing that the President\u2019s announcement envisaged an actual, simultaneous \u201creturn to work\u201d of 15,000 controllers, or for believing that all non-reporting controllers had been \u201cfired\u201d as of August 5. If any such belief existed, the notice petitioners received of a proposal to remove them and of their opportunity to reply should have disabused them of it. That one having <em>no </em>intent to strike would so cavalierly accept the loss of one\u2019s job as of August 5, or would fail to inquire, or would fail to report or return before 11:00 a.m. on August 5, 1981, or would fail to report for work at the next scheduled shift, or would fail to explain his absence at the agency proceeding or before the board, simply defies rationality.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-12\">The citations of criminal cases, in which proof must meet a beyond-a-reasonable-doubt standard and in which mere proof of absence was found consistent with resignation, <em>e.g., United States v. McCubbin, </em>Nos. 81-2059 through 2063 (10th Cir., Aug. 22, 1983); <em>United States v. Martinez, </em>686 F.2d 334 (5th Cir.1982), are inapt.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-13\">Petitioners\u2019 argument that the agency had a burden to notify each controller individually that he or she had until the specific time of that controller\u2019s next scheduled shift in which to take advantage of the President\u2019s grace period is without merit. Each petitioner knew when his next regularly-scheduled shift commenced and elected not to show up at that time. Having disregarded the initial 48 hour moratorium, petitioners can hardly complain that they were not specifically and \u2018 personally notified that each had an opportunity to also disregard an extension of that moratorium. There is nothing whatever of record to indicate that any petitioner would have returned or had any interest whatever in returning to work at the time of his next regularly scheduled shift. Nor is there any evidence whatever to indicate that every returning petitioner would have been turned aside. Indeed, the evidence is to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-14\"><em>Ad hoc </em>speculations of lawyers cannot substitute for evidence of what actually occurred. Though the court has in the rare circumstances of these cases permitted counsel substantial leeway in argument, there must be evidence in the record somewhere in these cases to support counsel\u2019s arguments, for this court\u2019s decision must be based on a \u201creview [of] the record\u201d. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7703(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b589-15\">The argument that confusion prevented formation of an intent to strike is at best unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>(2) <em>The Adverse Inference</em></p>\n<p id=\"b590-4\">Once the agency had presented evidence of strike participation, it was not improper to draw an adverse inference from petitioners\u2019 refusal to testify or otherwise offer rebuttal evidence before the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-5\">Adams concedes the propriety of adverse inferences in civil cases when a party is silent in the face of probative adverse evidence. <em>See Baxter v. Palmigiano, </em>425 U.S. 308, 318-19, 96 S.Ct. 1551, 1557-58, 47 L.Ed.2d 810 (1976); <em>Book v. Postal Service, </em>675 F.2d 158 (8th Cir.1982). The briefs say failure to deny the charges is irrelevant because the agency had not presented sufficient adverse evidence. The argument is meritless. The agency had presented before the Board a <em>prima facie </em>case of strike participation fully adequate to support the charges in the absence of countervailing rebuttal.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-6\">Attacking the presiding official\u2019s decision, Adams\u2019 brief says failure to rebut the agency\u2019s allegations was in that decision considered part of the <em>prima facie </em>case itself. Petitioners declined twice, however, to explain their absences, once during the agency removal proceedings and again during the Board hearing. The first failure to deny the charges left those absences unauthorized and unexplained, thereby adding to the sufficiency of the agency\u2019s <em>pri-ma facie </em>case. It is the Board\u2019s decision we review, and petitioners\u2019 silence before the Board, after the agency had established a <em>prima facie </em>case, fully warranted the Board\u2019s drawing of an adverse inference. \u201cSilence is often evidence of the most persuasive character\u201d. <em>United States ex rel. Bilokumsky v. Tod, </em>263 U.S. 149, 153-54, 44 S.Ct. 54, 56, 68 L.Ed. 221 (1923).</p>\n<p id=\"b590-7\">The judicial process is not entirely divorced from common sense and the everyday experiences of humankind. Petitioners had every reason and incentive to strenuously deny the charge of strike participation <em>if </em>they were not in truth strikers. But fear of prosecution for perjury, one may devoutly hope, has not entirely disappeared. The law and experience teach that a striker can be expected to refrain from falsely testifying under oath that his absence was due to non-strike reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-9\">No error occurred in the Board\u2019s drawing of an adverse inference in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-10\">(3) <em>Suspension</em></p>\n<p id=\"b590-11\">Petitioners argue that they should be given back pay because they were constructively suspended during the period between the notice proposing removal and the date of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-12\">Petitioners say that <em>if </em>they had reported for duty after failing to report after their deadlines, they would not have been permitted to work. Hence, say petitioners, reporting would have been a futile act, and that failure to place them in a non-duty-with-pay status was a constructive suspension. The Board, however, correctly held as a matter of law that petitioners had to show that they were ready, willing, and able to work after their receipt of notice. No such evidence was offered by these petitioners.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-13\">When petitioners failed to report to work as scheduled, they were considered absent without leave and were not paid. Like most federal employees, petitioners were not paid for unworked time, unless that time was scheduled as paid leave. Petitioners nonetheless claim entitlement to pay during a time when, through their own volition, they were absent from work without authorization, and during which they gave the agency no reason to believe they wanted to come to work. Choosing to absent themselves, petitioners created a situation in which the agency could not pay them, and at least an ambiguity in their pay status clarifiable only by action on their part. The view that one need not perform a knowingly futile act may be applicable to strikes in the private sector and to employer-created ambiguities. It is clearly inapplicable here. To order that petitioners be paid under the present circumstances is impermissible in view of long-standing federal pay policy and the necessity of distinguishing between those controllers who chose to report for duty <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>between the receipt of notice and the date of removal and those controllers who, like petitioners, did not.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-5\">Petitioners, moreover, bear the burden of establishing the Board\u2019s jurisdiction, <em>Stern v. Department of the Army, </em>699 F.2d 1312 (Fed.Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 103 S.Ct. 3095, 77 L.Ed.2d 1354 (1983), and their failure to establish that they were ready, willing, and able to work during the involved period constitutes a failure to carry that burden. Procedures under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7513 are inapplicable to \u201cvoluntary actions initiated by the employee\u201d. 5 CFR \u00a7 752.401(c)(3) (1981). <em>See Taylor v. United States, </em>591 F.2d 688, 219 Ct.Cl. 86 (1979). Non-duty status here was voluntary. It was not agency-enforced or agency-initiated disciplinary action. There was no suspension, constructive or otherwise. <em>See Armand v. United States, </em>136 Ct.Cl. 339 (1956).</p>\n<p id=\"b591-8\">The argument based on a constructive suspension theory must fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-9\">(4) <em>The Strike Period</em></p>\n<p id=\"b591-10\">Petitioner Giannattasio was not required to report for work until 11 a.m., August 12, 1981, apparently because he was on annual leave until that time. When he failed to report, he was served with a notice of proposed removal dated August 12, 1981, charging him with striking as of that date. Giannattasio contended before the Board that the agency had not proved the strike was still in progress on August 12. The Board rejected that assertion, finding that the strike continued at least through August 19, 1981.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-11\">It has been said that the agency must prove: (1) that a strike was in progress on the date striking is charged; and (2) that the employee could have returned to work on that date. <em>Ketcham v. Federal Aviation Administration, </em>82 FMSR 1f 7026 (May 28, 1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b591-12\">The unrebutted evidence in the present case shows conclusively that the New York Center air traffic controllers were not fired at 11 a.m. on August 5, 1981, and were not locked out at that time. Giannattasio concedes that the agency interpreted the President\u2019s August 3, 1981 announcement as permitting air traffic controllers to return to work at the time of their first assigned shift beginning after 11 a.m., on August 5, 1981.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-14\">There is no evidence in this record that if Giannattasio had attempted to return to work at 7 a.m. on August 12 he would not have been allowed to do so. Indeed, the evidence is to the contrary. As the Board noted, the chief of the New York Center \u201ctestified that each of the appellants would have been permitted to return to work prior to the deadline shift with which they were charged with striking.\u201d Nor is there any evidence that Giannattasio was removed before August 28, 1981, after he had received the notice of proposed termination and filed a written reply thereto.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-15\">The only remaining issue is whether substantial evidence supports the Board\u2019s findings that- the strike still continued on August 12, 1981, and that Giannattasio\u2019s failure to report on that date constituted participation in the strike. There is no doubt that a strike began on August 3, 1981. That strike continued until some event ended it.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-16\">There is no evidence that the union terminated the strike before August 12, 1981. Substantial absences continued at the New York Center well into September, as did picketing with signs stating \u201cPATCO LOCAL 201 ON STRIKE\u201d and numerous statements by union officials that the strike of Local 201 was continuing. Neither did the government end the strike before that date by terminating the employment relationship between itself and the controllers. Although the government had begun procedures to remove the controllers by August 12, Giannattasio and many of his fellow controllers were still employees on that date.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-17\">Giannattasio relies on pronouncements and press statements of various government officials indicating that the strike ended before August 12, 1981, and on statements in court opinions indicating that the strike ended before August 19, 1981. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number><em>See United States v. Haggerty, </em>528 F.Supp. 1286 (D.Col.1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b592-4\">The government cites other authority in support of the Board\u2019s finding that the strike continued substantially beyond August 5, 1981. <em>See United States v. Taylor, </em>693 F.2d 919 (9th Cir.1982) (air traffic controller convicted of participating in the PATCO strike on August 8, 1981); <em>PATCO v. F.L.R.A., </em>685 F.2d 547 (D.C.Cir.1982) (holding that strike lasted until November 1981); <em>United States v. PATCO, </em>527 F.Supp. 1344 (N.D.Ill.1981) (preliminary injunction on November 11, 1981, restricting place and manner of picketing by striking air traffic controllers); <em>PATCO v. Federal Aviation Administration, </em>7 F.L.R.A. No. 10 (Nov. 3, 1981) (supplemental opinion of Chairman noting-PATCO had neither disavowed nor attempted to end the strike as of November 3, 1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b592-5\">The evidence upon which Giannattasio relies does not undermine the Board\u2019s findings that the strike continued until at least August 19, 1981. However government officials may have viewed the strike, the objective facts outlined above support the Board\u2019s findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-6\">We hold that substantial evidence supports the Board\u2019s finding that the strike continued at the New York Center at least until August 19, 1981. Our review function thereupon ends.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-7\">Petitioners having made no attempt to rebut the foregoing evidence before the Board, Adams\u2019 brief suggests before us that the sign-carrying picketers may not have been striking controllers, but \u201cjust members of the public merely exercising their first amendment rights.\u201d The argument is imaginative but without merit in light of all the evidence.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b592-9\">(5) <em>Other Petitioners</em></p>\n<p id=\"b592-10\">Listed in Appendix B to this opinion are other petitioners whose appeals were consolidated for decisional purposes before the Board in <em>MSPB Docket No. NY075281F0^2Ji </em>and who filed individual appeals under the numbers listed.

Listed in Appendix A are petitioners whose appeals are hereby decided under Appeal No. 83-1155.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b588-9\">. Adams' assertion that a sentence in one stock PATCO response (challenging any basis for a charge of committing a crime) was a denial of the charges is creative, but unavailing. The sentence was directed at the agency's use of a shortened notice period.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b588-10\">. <em>Amici </em>want the removals vacated for lack of a , 30 day notice, asserting: (1) notice was sent before petitioners were found striking; and (2) 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1918, (making strikes a crime) violates the Thirteenth Amendment. Argument (1) is unfounded. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7513(b) requires only a \u201creasonable cause to believe\u201d an employee has committed a crime. Argument (2), impressively stated, attempts too much. Nothing in \u00a7 1918 compels anyone to work against his or her will. It neither prohibits nor impedes resignations.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-12\">Adams, Baracco, and <em>Amici </em>say the removal notice provided for reply \"within 7 calendar days,\u201d thus providing effectively for 6 days, in violation of 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7513(b)(2) (reply in \u201cnot less than 7 days\u201d). The argument is semantic and senseless on this record. The Board held the notice itself inclusive of 7 days, though it found harmless error in a letter denying time enlargement to Baracco. Each petitioner responded to the notice within 7 days. In requesting time enlargements, petitioners said they did not think \"seven days is a reasonable time\u201d. If there were error, it was harmless, no request for an oral reply time having been made within the seven day period. The burden to show harm is petitioners\u2019, 5 CFR \u00a7 1201.56(b)(1), <em>Shaw v. Postal Service, </em>697 F.2d 1078, 1080 (Fed.Cir.1983); yet no effort was made to show that any additional reply was or would have been attempted on the seventh day. The argument might be appropriate if the agency had refused to consider a reply filed on the seventh day because not filed \"within 7 calendar days.\u201d This court does not sit, however, to decide hypotheticals.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b589-6\">. The assertion that petitioner Miller did not understand the charges is directly refuted in Miller\u2019s letter, the only evidence cited in the briefs as indicating that at least one petitioner was confused.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b592-8\">. An <em>amicus </em>in appeal No. 83-1156 chastises the Board for taking \"official notice\" that a nationwide strike continued through August 6, 1981. The issue does not appear to have been raised before the Board in any of the \"lead\u201d cases, by way of petition for reconsideration or otherwise. Because, also, the agency proved Baracco was on strike through August 7, 1981, because Baracco made no effort to refute the facts noticed, <em>see Ohio Bell Telephone Co. v. Public Utility Commission of Ohio, </em>301 U.S. 292, 57 S.Ct. 724, 81 L.Ed. 1093 (1937), and because the Board did not deny petitioners their due process right to establish the nonexistence of a strike at their location or their nonparticipation as strikers, the issue is inappropriately argued here.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b593-6\">NIES, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"A9j\">concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-7\">I join in the majority opinion and write only because I see a need for treatment of the issue of harmful error to a greater extent than it has been given in note 3 of the majority opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-8\">The <em>Baracco </em>appeal is the lead case on interpretation of the harmless error provision found in 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7701(c)(2)(A) vis-a-vis the statutorily mandated time period for reply to the notice of proposed removal. Baracco asserts that he was given only 6 days to reply, but for reasons not discussed in the majority opinion or pertinent to other controllers.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-9\">Baracco was sent the same notice as other controllers. Thus, under the majority decision here, he was initially given a 7-day notice period. The notice was mailed August 7 by regular mail with a duplicate sent the same day by certified mail. Since Baracco did not testify, we do not know when he received the notice by regular mail which, if before receipt of the certified mail, would have started the running of the reply period. In any event, he signed for the certified mail on August 11. In an undated letter from Baracco to the agency received August 14, he requested an extension of time to file written reply on the ground that \u201cseven days\u201d was not a reasonable time for filing a response. At that time he knew he had 7 days, as the MSPB found. In reply, the agency denied \u201can extension of time to submit a written reply beyond the seven day period.\u201d Had the agency letter stopped there, Baracco would have no basis for argument that he is in a different situation from others. However, in the same letter, the agency stated that the written response was to be submitted \u201cprior to August 18, 1981, the expiration of the seven day notice period.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b593-11\">Treating this as arguably creating an ambiguity as to the final date for reply, the presiding official ruled that Baracco would have had to show, in any event, that a 6-day reply period was harmful error, that is, that the error might have affected the outcome of the case. Since Baracco had made a written reply within 7 days and offered no evidence at any time of individual circumstances which might have changed the outcome, the presiding official ruled that Baracco failed to show harmful error. The board agreed that Baracco was required to show that the asserted procedural error was harmful.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-12\">Baracco\u2019s position is that harmful error should not have entered into resolution of the issue of the shortened notice period. Baracco maintains that his right to a minimum 7-day reply period, unquestionably required by 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7513(b)(2), rendered the action \u201cnot in accordance with law\u201d within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7701(c)(2)(C), set out below, and that, therefore, reversal is required. In essence, Baracco argues that a statutory procedural requirement is not subject to the harmful error provision of 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7701(c)(2)(A). Stated another way, violation of a statutory procedural requirement is harmful <em>per se.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b593-13\">The statutory provisions under consideration here read in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b593-14\">7701(c)(2) [T]he agency\u2019s decision may not be sustained ... if the employee</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b593-15\">(A) shows harmful error in the application of the agency\u2019s procedures in arriving at such decision.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b593-16\">Hs sfc * * # sfc</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b593-17\">(C) shows that the decision was not in accordance with law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b594-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>The MSPB carefully reviewed the statutory history of the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978, Pub.L. No. 95-454, 92 Stat. 1111 (1978) (Reform Act) to discern the relationship of these two provisions and found no clear guide to their interpretation. However, it found direction, in favor of the presiding official\u2019s ruling, in the numerous expressions of concern during hearings on the Reform Act about unnecessary procedural reversals of agency actions.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b594-4\">In rejecting Baracco\u2019s argument, the board also found guidance in the need to give effect to all parts of the statute. The board reasoned that procedural regulations have the force of law and that, if the harmful error provision could not be applied in connection with procedures established by statute, by the same token, it could not be applied to procedures established by regulations which have the force of law. Therefore, the statutory provision on harmful error would be meaningless.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-5\">The board then reviewed and reconciled its own decisions with its holding here, and, finally, found support for its interpretation in precedent of this court, particularly, <em>Doyle v. Veterans Administration, </em>667 F.2d 70, 72, 229 Ct.Cl. 261 (1981); <em>Brewer v. U.S. Postal Service, </em>647 F.2d 1093, 1097, 227 Ct.Cl. 276 (1981), <em>cert. denied, </em>454 U.S. 1144, 102 S.Ct. 1005, 71 L.Ed.2d 296 (1982) and <em>Shaw v. U.S. Postal Service, </em>697 F.2d 1078 (Fed.Cir.1983). For example, as stated by Senior Judge Cowen in <em>Brewer, </em>the first ease reviewed by the Court of Claims under the Reform Act:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b594-6\">In enacting the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978, Congress declared that this court should reverse agency actions for procedural error \u201conly if the procedures followed substantially impaired the rights of the employees.\u201d S.Rep. No. 969, 95th Cong., 2d Sess. 64, <em>reprinted in </em>[1978] U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News 2723, 2786.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b594-10\">647 F.2d at 1097.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-11\">In support of the contrary position, petitioner cites cases, for example <em>Ryder v. United States, </em>585 F.2d 482, 218 Ct.Cl. 289 (1978) and <em>Washington v. United States, </em>147 F.Supp. 284, 137 Ct.Cl. 344 <em>cert. denied, </em>355 U.S. 801, 78 S.Ct. 6, 2 L.Ed.2d 19 (1957), which are clearly no longer controlling in view of the addition to the statute of the harmful error provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-12\">Turning again to the precise language of the statute, I conclude that paragraphs (A) and (C) are directed at different evils. Harmful error in procedures (paragraph A) raises the question: Did the wrongful procedure harm the employee in the presentation of his defense so that a different result might have been reached? Petitioner here has not asserted such harm. He asks simply for a <em>per se </em>rule. That is not a \u201cshowing\u201d of harm as the statute requires. Paragraph (C), on the other hand, is directed <em>to the decision </em>itself. Was the decision in its entirety in accordance with law? Since the harmful error rule is part of the law, the question becomes: Is the decision in accordance with the law including the harmful error provision? Tested against this standard, the <em>Baracco </em>decision cannot be reversed since no harmful error has been shown.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b594-7\">. <em>See Hearings Before the Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs on S. 2640, S. 2707 and S. 2830, </em>95th Cong. 2d Sess. 22, 43, 101, 146 (1978); <em>Hearings Before the House Committee on Post Office and Civil Service on H.R. 11280, </em>95th Cong., 2d Sess. 31, 122-23 (1978).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
