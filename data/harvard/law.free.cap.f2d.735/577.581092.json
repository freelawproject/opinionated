AIAW alleged that NCAA unlawfully used its monopoly power in men\u2019s college sports to facilitate its entry into women\u2019s college sports and to force AIAW out of existence. United States District Judge Thomas P. Jackson, after trial, found no antitrust violation and entered judgment for NCAA. On appeal, AIAW contests the district court\u2019s fact findings and legal analysis. Although we disagree in part with one portion of the district court\u2019s legal analysis, that court\u2019s disposition ultimately and properly turns on fact findings that are not clearly erroneous. We therefore affirm the district court\u2019s decision rejecting AIAW\u2019s claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-20\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b677-21\">From 1906 to 1980, NC\u00c1A sponsored programs only for men\u2019s intercollegiate athletics. In 1967, the Commission on Intercollegiate Athletics for Women (ClAW) was organized to provide a governing body for women\u2019s athletics. In 1971, CIAW was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>transformed into AIAW, an organization that throughout its existence governed only women\u2019s sports. In' 1971-72, AIAW' sponsored' seven national championships for its 278 members. By 1980-81, AIAW\u2019s membership had grown to 961 colleges and universities. AIAW\u2019s standing as the major governing body in women\u2019s sports ended, however, in the fall of 1981.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-4\">In the 1981-82 sports season, NCAA introduced twenty-nine women\u2019s championships in twelve sports. During the same season, AIAW suffered a significant drop in membership and participation in its events. AIAW\u2019s loss in membership dues totalled $124,000, which represented approximately twenty-two percent of the dues collected the previous year. Forty-nine percent of those institutions leaving AIAW elected to place their women\u2019s sports programs under NCAA\u2019s governance. Even among those schools that maintained AIAW memberships, a significant number chose to .participate in NCAA events instead of the AIAW counterparts.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-5\">AIAW also suffered promotional losses. National Broadcasting Company (NBC) decided not to exercise its exclusive television rights to telecast AIAW championships. NBC\u2019s disinterest resulted in large part from a decline in the number and quality of participants in AIAW events. <em>Association for Intercollegiate Athletics for Women v. National Collegiate Athletic Ass\u2019n, </em>558 F.Supp. 487, 493 (D.D.C.1983). The Eastman Kodak Company and the Broderick Company, because of AIAW\u2019s participation losses, both sought to withdraw sponsorship of AIAW achievement awards. <em>Id. </em>at 493-94. AIAW\u2019s diminished stature following NCAA\u2019s entry into women\u2019s sports also hindered AIAW\u2019s efforts to market its logo. AIAW had further difficulty securing national championship sites, holding volunteer staff, and realizing profits from its Division I championship events. <em>Id. </em>Since AIAW\u2019s leadership expected these financial hardships only to worsen, it decided not to distribute membership renewal applications for the 1982-83 season. AIAW closed business on June 30, 1982.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-10\">On October 9, 1981, AIAW filed suit against NCAA in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia. AIAW alleged that NCAA violated sections 1, 2, and 3 of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1, 2, 3 (1982), by using its monopoly power in men\u2019s college sports to facilitate its entry into women\u2019s college sports and to force AIAW out of existence.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Specifically, AIAW asserted that NCAA\u2019s unlawful conduct consisted of predatory pricing, the use of financial incentives to \u201clink\u201d the sale of competitive services with the sale of monopoly services, and an illegal tying arrangement.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-11\">A. <em>NCAA\u2019s Contested Conduct</em></p>\n<p id=\"b678-12\">1. NCAA\u2019s Dues Policy</p>\n<p id=\"b678-13\">Before NCAA introduced women\u2019s events, NCAA members paid a single flat fee for the option of participating in all the events in their respective NCAA divisions. For the 1981-82 season, NCAA did not increase its flat rate, or charge a separate fee, for those members participating in the newly instituted women's events. NCAA continued this practice through June 1982 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>when AIAW closed business. AIAW asserts that the price for participating in a college sports program is the membership dues associated with that program. Since NCAA\u2019s \u201cprice\u201d for participation in its women\u2019s program was effectively zero and thus well below the cost of the program, AIAW cites NCAA\u2019s dues policy as a classic example of predatory pricing.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b679-4\">2. NCAA\u2019s Proceeds Distribution Formula</p>\n<p id=\"b679-5\">Before 1981, NCAA guaranteed both transportation and per diem expenses to participants in all its championships. Also, after event administration expenses were deducted from revenues generated by a championship, remaining proceeds were distributed 50% to NCAA and 50% to institutions competing in the championship. When NCAA began to \u25a0 sponsor women\u2019s events, however, it changed this proceeds distribution formula. Although NCAA continued to guarantee reimbursement of transportation expenses, per diem expenses for championships were paid only from surplus revenue after event administration costs had been covered. Any revenues that remained after paying per diem expenses were used first to repay NCAA for the travel allowance, and only then were distributed to participating institutions. NCAA readily concedes that these changes reduced the likelihood of teams receiving either per diem reimbursements or championship proceeds.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-6\">AIAW argues that revisions in NCAA\u2019s distribution formula created financial incentives for schools whose men\u2019s teams already participated in NCAA events to enroll their women\u2019s teams in NCAA as well. The revisions, notes AIAW, decreased payments to current men\u2019s participants substantially below their former level. Because NCAA has monopoly power in men\u2019s sports, it allegedly did not fear losing participants in men\u2019s events due to the reduced proceeds allocated to those events. The only effect, AIAW argues, was to encourage coeducational institutions to enroll their women\u2019s programs in NCAA events to recoup lost proceeds shifted from men\u2019s to women\u2019s sports. AIAW contends that only by obtaining NCAA\u2019s relatively generous women\u2019s reimbursements could a coeducational institution avoid a net loss in subsidization for its entire athletic program. AIAW thus claims the revisions in NCAA\u2019s distribution formula produced irresistible inducements for coeducational schools to transfer their women\u2019s programs from AIAW to NCAA. These inducements allegedly constituted an \u201cunlawful linkage,\u201d tantamount to a coercive tie, of women\u2019s events to the monopolized men\u2019s events.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-11\">3. NCAA\u2019s Sale of Television Rights</p>\n<p id=\"b679-12\">In the winter of 1981, NCAA negotiated the sale of television rights for its men\u2019s basketball championship with Columbia Broadcasting System (CBS) and National Broadcasting Company (NBC). In the course of negotiations, NCAA asked each network to clarify its position, <em>inter alia, </em>on a proposed rights fee for televising NCAA\u2019s women\u2019s basketball championship game. CBS originally offered $225,000 over three years for the women\u2019s basketball championship. NBC proposed $525,-000 for the same television rights. NCAA, however, awarded CBS a contract covering both the men\u2019s and women\u2019s championships. NCAA\u2019s presentation indicates that its decision stemmed from CBS\u2019s offering some three million dollars more than NBC for the men\u2019s championship, and from the efficiencies of selling both championships to the same network.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-13\">AIAW contends, however, that NCAA tied the sale of television rights for its women\u2019s basketball championship to the rights for its men\u2019s counterpart. Because NCAA is a monopoly seller of television rights for men\u2019s college basketball championships, AIAW alleges NCAA was able to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>thrust its women\u2019s championship upon an unwilling purchaser. AIAW thus argues that CBS was forced to purchase the women\u2019s event, in which it had no interest, in order to obtain the men\u2019s event, which was of paramount importance.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b680-4\">B. <em>District Court\u2019s Decision</em></p>\n<p id=\"azo-dedup-0\">The district court characterized NCAA, in one respect as an \u201c[ejleemosynary organization [ ] ... [that] exist[s] primarily to enhance the contribution made by amateur athletic competition to ... higher education ____\u201d 558 F.Supp. at 494. In another respect, the court found that NCAA was a \u201cvertically integrated seller [] of governance and promotional services for athletic competition\u201d and capable of considerable restraint on commercial enterprise. <em>Id. </em>at 494, 497. Because of its noncommercial dimension, the district court concluded that NCAA was not subject to liability deriving from conduct alone. Rather, \u201c[s]ection 1 claims are judged under the Rule of Reason even when restraints are patent, and there must be proof of specific intent as a predicate to a finding of an abuse of monopoly power under [s]ection 2.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 495 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b680-7\">With regard to AIAW\u2019s monopolization claim, the district court found as a factual matter that NCAA did not achieve monopoly power in women\u2019s sports during the 1981-82 season, the sole year NCAA was in competition with AIAW. <em>Id. </em>at 501.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The district court thus considered only whether NCAA <em>attempted </em>to monopolize women\u2019s sports by means of its dues and reimbursement policies. <em>Id. </em>It concluded that AIAW failed to prove NCAA acted with the specific intent necessary to sustain an attempted monopolization claim. <em>Id. </em>at 506. The court upheld NCAA\u2019s dues and reimbursements policies on the alternative ground that AIAW did not prove a causal connection between NCAA\u2019s disputed practices and AIAW\u2019s economic injury. <em>Id. </em>at 506-07.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-11\">The district court also rejected AIAW's section 1 claims. First, the court found that AIAW failed to prove the requisite joint conduct, except with regard to the tying charge, on the part of NCAA. <em>Id. </em>at 498. The tying charge was rejected after the district court determined, as a factual matter, that NCAA did not condition the purchase of television rights for its men\u2019s basketball championship upon the purchase of the women\u2019s counterpart. <em>Id. </em>at 500. Having concluded that AIAW did not prove facts sufficient to constitute either a section 1 or 2 violation, the district court entered judgment for NCAA.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-12\">On appeal, AIAW contests portions of the district court\u2019s fact findings and legal analysis. Although we disagree in part with the district court's statement of how the antitrust laws apply to NCAA practices, we find no error in its ultimate conclusion that AIAW failed to prove any antitrust violation. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment for NCAA.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-13\">II. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b680-14\">NCAA argues that its nonprofit status and affiliation with higher education warrant special treatment under the antitrust laws. Its position rests primarily on a much-discussed footnote in <em>Goldfarb v. Virginia State Bar, </em>421 U.S. 773, 788-89 n. 17, 95 S.Ct. 2004, 2013-14 n. 17, 44 L.Ed.2d 572 (1975). There, the Supreme Court indicated that practices of professional organizations may not be inter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>changeable with those of commercial businesses for the purpose of antitrust analysis.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> NCAA contends that practices of nonprofit athletic associations are no more interchangeable with business activities than are practices of professions. NCAA therefore suggests that even where its conduct has significant anticompetitive consequences, that conduct may be justified by a motive to accomplish the legitimate nonprofit goals of the association.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-4\">The district court agreed that NCAA\u2019s conduct alone, without regard to motive, could not give rise to antitrust liability. The court thus concluded that AIAW must demonstrate anticompetitive intent as well as effect to establish NCAA\u2019s civil antitrust liability under section 1 or 2 of the Sherman Act. 558 F.Supp. at 495. We reject the district court\u2019s position that intent is a separate and essential prerequisite to civil antitrust liability of organizations such as NCAA.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> A party\u2019s intent is relevant only insofar as it helps predict the probable competitive impact of a disputed practice. <em>Chicago Board of Trade v. United States, </em>246 U.S. 231, 238, 38 S.Ct. 242, 243, 62 L.Ed. 683 (1918); <em>Wilk v. American Medical Ass\u2019n, </em>719 F.2d 207, 225 (7th Cir.1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b681-11\">Our emphasis on competitive effect, as opposed to intent, comports with recent Supreme Court precedent dealing with regulatory or nonprofit organizations.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In <em>National Soc\u2019y of Professional Eng\u2019rs v. United States, </em>435 U.S. 679, 98 S.Ct. 1355, 55 L.Ed.2d 637 (1978), the professional organization essentially acknowledged the anticompetitive effect of its disputed conduct, but claimed that its legitimate professional purpose of maintaining quality engineering justified the commercial restraint. The Supreme Court rejected the organization\u2019s argument and instructed that noneconomic justifications generally do not cure significant anticompetitive effects. <em>Id. </em>at 692-96, 98 S.Ct. at 1365-67. <em>See also American Soc\u2019y of Mechanical Eng\u2019rs, Inc. v. Hydrolevel Corp., </em>456 U.S. 556, 573-74, 102 S.Ct. 1935, 1946, 72 L.Ed.2d 330 (1982). Accordingly, practices by non-profit organizations that economically disadvantage consumers are generally prohibited even though such practices may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>be designed to advance independent social or political values.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b682-4\">Although the district court\u2019s review of the law unduly emphasized intent, its disposition of AIAW\u2019s claims rested on fact findings as to the <em>de minimis </em>competitive impact and noncoerciveness of NCAA\u2019s disputed practices.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Because the district court had no occasion to apply its erroneous abstract analysis, its error was rendered harmless. Fed.R.Civ.P. 61; <em>Ommaya v. National Institutes of Health, </em>726 F.2d 827 at 830 (D.C.Cir.1984). To resolve this appeal, we accordingly turn to the precise grounds upon which the district court rejected AIAW\u2019s claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-5\">A. <em>AIAW\u2019s Claims Regarding NCAA\u2019s Dues Policy and Proceeds Distribution Formula</em></p>\n<p id=\"b682-6\">AIAW asserts that NCAA used its dues policy as a predatory pricing scheme and its proceeds distribution formula to create \u201cirresistible inducements\u201d to facilitate its entry into women\u2019s sports. AIAW claims that such conduct constituted alternatively an unlawful monopolization, an attempt to monopolize, or at least an unlawful use of monopoly power in one market to damage competition in another market.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-7\">1. Unlawful Monopolization</p>\n<p id=\"Avm6\">To establish a monopolization claim, the plaintiff must demonstrate that the defendant in fact acquired monopoly power as a result of unlawful conduct. <em>United States v. Grinnell Corp., </em>384 U.S. 563, 570-71, 86 S.Ct. 1698, 1703-04, 16 L.Ed.2d 778 (1966); <em>United States v. U.S. Steel Corp., </em>251 U.S. 417, 450-52, 40 S.Ct. 293, 298-99, 64 L.Ed. 343 (1920). The district court determined that NCAA had acquired no monopoly power in women\u2019s sports by June 1982. To prevail in this court on its monopolization claim, AIAW must demonstrate that the district court\u2019s factual conclusion was clearly erroneous. Fed.R.Civ. P. 52(a). <em>See Halberstam v. Welch, </em>705 F.2d 472, 486 &amp; n. 16 (D.C.Cir.1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b682-12\">The district court based its finding on a comparison of NCAAls and AIAW\u2019s respective standing in women\u2019s sports for 1981-82. In its final year of existence, AIAW enrolled more members and offered twelve more women\u2019s championships in seven more sports than NCAA. <em>Association for Intercollegiate Athletics for Women, </em>558 F.Supp. at 501. In every sport in which NCAA offered a women\u2019s championship, more NCAA members participated in the corresponding AIAW championship than in NCAA\u2019s championship. Docket Entry 65 at 29; Docket Entry 66 at 9 paras. 33, 33A. AIAW voluntarily ceased operations in June 1982, not because of current bankruptcy, but due to a business estimation of accelerating economic hardship in 1982-83. 558 F.Supp. at 494. Because we do not find clearly erroneous the district court\u2019s conclusion that NCAA had not acquired a monopoly in women\u2019s sports by June 1982, we affirm its dismissal of AIAW\u2019s monopolization claim.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b683-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>2. Attempted Monopolization</p>\n<p id=\"b683-4\">Attempted monopolization consists of a specific intent to acquire monopoly power by means of exclusionary conduct and a dangerous probability that such conduct, if unchecked, would produce the desired monopoly. <em>Times-Picayune Publishing Co. v. United States, </em>345 U.S. 594, 626-27, 73 S.Ct. 872, 889-90, 97 L.Ed. 1277 (1953); <em>Swift and Co. v. United States, </em>196 U.S. 375, 396, 402, 25 S.Ct. 276, 279, 281, 49 L.Ed. 518 (1905). Although AIAW proved that NCAA\u2019s eventual monopolization of women\u2019s sports was \u201ca likelihood,\u201d 558 F.Supp. at 501,. the district court found absent the requisite specific intent. <em>Id. </em>at 506.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-5\">AIAW asserts that the district court misconstrued the specific intent requirement by allowing altruistic motives to cleanse a purposeful attempt to monopolize. AIAW contends the district court held that NCAA intended to drive AIAW out of existence, but that such an intention was saved by NCAA\u2019s salutary motive to provide a singular governance and promotion system for women\u2019s sports. We agree that specific intent in attempted monopolization cases has little relation to the defendant\u2019s altruistic or malevolent motivations. Rather, specific intent in this context refers to a purpose to acquire monopoly power by driving one\u2019s rival from the market by exclusionary or predatory means.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The law thus inquires not <em>why, </em>but <em>whether, </em>one intends to acquire unlawful monopoly power. <em>See United States v. Grinnell Corp., </em>236 F.Supp. 244, 251 (D.R.I.1964), <em>rev\u2019d in part on other grounds, </em>384 U.S. 563, 86 S.Ct. 1698, 16 L.Ed.2d 778 (1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b683-9\">After considering the district court\u2019s full discussion of AIAW\u2019s attempted monopolization claim, we conclude that the court properly applied the law on specific intent. The district court cited and found persuasive considerable record evidence indicating that NCAA viewed \u201cthe continued existence of AIAW as a healthy alternative to the NCAA ...,\u201d and that NCAA\u2019s objective was not \u201cto take over women\u2019s athletics.\u201d 558 F.Supp. at 505, 506. The court then noted that NCAA\u2019s exhaustive and open debate on the appropriate objectives of its women\u2019s programs represented \u201cthe antithesis of ... conspiratorial plotting ... to acquire surreptitious control of a market____\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 506. Immediately thereafter, the court concluded that AIAW \u201cfailed to prove the specific intent necessary to sustain its -claim of attempted monopoly.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b683-11\">The district court\u2019s frequent reference to NCAA\u2019s contemplated co-existence with AIAW reflects the court\u2019s recognition that the relevant inquiry was whether NCAA intended to destroy AIAW. Furthermore, the court\u2019s conclusion that NCAA\u2019s adopting a women\u2019s program did not represent an attempt \u201cto acquire surreptitious control of a market\u201d indicates that it resolved the relevant inquiry in the negative.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>accordingly affirm the district court\u2019s finding of no attempted monopolization.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b684-4\">3. Leveraged Use of Monopoly Power</p>\n<p id=\"azl-dedup-0\">AIAW\u2019s third section 2 claim alleges that NCAA unlawfully <em>distorted </em>competition in women\u2019s sports, even though NCAA may not have <em>sought </em>or <em>gained </em>a monopoly in the market. NCAA allegedly caused this \u201cdistortion\u201d by using its monopoly power in men\u2019s sports as a \u201clever\u201d to facilitate its entry into women\u2019s sports. AIAW relies primarily on <em>Berkey Photo, Inc. v. Eastman Kodak Co., </em>603 F.2d 263 (2d Cir.1979), ce<em>rt. denied, </em>444 U.S. 1093, 100 S.Ct. 1061, 62 L.Ed.2d 783 (1980), to support the legal sufficiency of its leveraging claim. In <em>Berkey Photo, </em>the Second Circuit held that \u201ca firm violates \u00a7 2 by using its monopoly power in one market to gain a competitive advantage in another, albeit without an attempt to monopolize the second market____ That the competition in the leveraged market may not be destroyed but merely distorted does not make it more palatable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 275. <em>See also M.A.P. Oil Co. v. Texaco, Inc., </em>691 F.2d 1303, 1305-06 (9th Cir.1982); <em>Grason Elec. Co. v. Sacramento Mun. Util. Dist., </em>571 F.Supp. 1504, 1513-19 (E.D.Cal.1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b684-12\">Assuming <em>arguendo </em>that leveraging is a distinct section 2 offense,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> we note that a plaintiff still must prove the disputed use of monopoly power in fact caused economic injury and that such use was unlawful.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> <em>See, e.g., MCI Communications Corp. v. American Tel. &amp; Tel. Co., </em>708 F.2d 1081, 1161-62 (7th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 104 S.Ct. 234, 78 L.Ed.2d 226 (1983); <em>J.T. Gibbons, Inc. v. Crawford Fitting Co., </em>704 F.2d 787, 793-94 (5th Cir.1983). AIAW argues that NCAA\u2019s dues policy and proceeds distribution formula were the unlawful means by which NCAA used its monopoly power in men\u2019s sports to injure AIAW\u2019s standing in women\u2019s sports. The district court, however, found that AIAW failed to establish the causal relationship between NCAA\u2019s disputed practices and AIAW\u2019s economic injury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b684-14\">[Pjlaintiff\u2019s evidence with respect to the blandishments [i.e., \u201cfree dues\u201d and travel reimbursements] offered by the NCAA is both imprecise and contradictory, and it does not support a conclusion that the NCAA, in effect, bought defectors from AIAW with its superior economic resources.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b685-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>558 F.Supp. at 506-07. The district court thus concluded that the competitive impact of NCAA\u2019s dues and reimbursement policies was essentially <em>de minimis. Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b685-4\">A review of the record does not reveal that the district court\u2019s conclusion was clearly erroneous. <em>See Bellevue Gardens, Inc. v. Hill, </em>297 F.2d 185, 186-87 (D.C.Cir.1961). The court observed that two former AIAW presidents were unable to refer specifically to any institution that left AIAW in 1981-82 due to NCAA\u2019s \u201ceconomic incentives.\u201d 558 F.Supp. at 506; R.E. at 287, 289-92, 361-65.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Moreover, several witnesses indicated that their institutions participated in NCAA championships, not to receive the alleged irresistible economic inducements, but rather because NCAA offered a superior product.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Thus, if AIAW\u2019s losses were NCAA\u2019s gains, the court properly concluded from substantial record evidence that the shift in membership and participation \u201cwas [not] the product of anything but direct competition.\u201d 558 F.Supp. at 506.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-5\">The court\u2019s conclusion is hardly remarkable given the nature of NCAA\u2019s dues and reimbursement policies. First, neither policy is exclusionary. The dues policy, which simply continued NCAA\u2019s past practice, did not make NCAA membership contingent on an institution\u2019s abstaining from AIAW\u2019s membership rolls or from participating in AIAW events. R.E. at 107. Additionally, the dues policy did not require NCAA members to enroll their women\u2019s programs in NCAA events or penalize them for not doing so. R.E. at 109. Similarly, the proceeds distribution formula did not condition reimbursement on exclusive NCAA membership or exclusive participation in NCAA events. 558 F.Supp. at 502. Indeed, NCAA agreed to judge female participants\u2019 eligibility according to NCAA rules or \u201cthe published rules of <em>any recognized state, conference, regional or national organization </em>pf which an institution had been a member as of August 1, 1981____\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 503 (emphasis added). The disputed NCAA practices thus allowed coeducational institutions to maintain dual women\u2019s memberships and participate in both associations\u2019 events under either association\u2019s rules without suffering any penalty in membership dues or reimbursements.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-11\">Second, neither NCAA\u2019s dues nor its reimbursement policy sprung from a predatory intent that could indicate a potential anticompetitive effect. As discussed above, the district court rejected AIAW\u2019s argument, on the basis of insufficient persuasive evidence, that NCAA\u2019s purpose was to monopolize women\u2019s sports by unlawfully driving AIAW from the market. <em>See supra </em>\u00a7 II A2. AIAW thus failed to prove that either policy represented anything other than NCAA members\u2019 rational judgment of how best and most equitably to promote men's and women\u2019s intercollegiate athletics.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-12\">Finally, both the dues policy and the reimbursement formula governed essentially noncommercial conduct. The dues policy regulated only the flow of funds from NCAA members to the association; it did not affect members\u2019 or the association\u2019s dealings with third-party commercial enterprises. <em>Cf. Board of Regents of Univ. of Okla v. NCAA, </em>707 F.2d 1147 (10th Cir.) (NCAA proscription of members\u2019 individual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>sale of television rights violates the Sherman Act), <em>cert. granted, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 104 S.Ct. 272, 78 L.Ed.2d 253 (1983). Despite AIAW\u2019s effort to characterize NCAA\u2019s dues as a predatory pricing scheme, we believe the dues format is more accurately viewed as a mechanism by which members established the appropriate amount each must contribute to the organization.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> We conclude NCAA\u2019s dues policy was essentially an internal housekeeping matter that did not provide a means by which members or NCAA itself directly engaged in commerce. Similarly, we construe NCAA\u2019s reimbursement formula as a regulation governing the internal redistribution of NCAA\u2019s revenues among its members. Like the dues policy, the formula did not bear on members\u2019 or NCAA\u2019s interaction with third-party commercial enterprises.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b686-9\">That NCAA\u2019s disputed practices were not exclusionary, did not spring from a predatory intent, and regulated essentially noncommercial conduct further suggests that these practices would have a <em>de minimis </em>competitive impact. We therefore are especially reluctant to disturb the district court\u2019s factual assessment, based on substantial record evidence, to the same effect. We accordingly affirm the district court\u2019s holding that AIAW failed to establish that it suffered antitrust injury as a result of NCAA\u2019s dues policy or proceeds distribution formula.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b687-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>B. <em>AIAW\u2019s Claims Regarding NCAA\u2019s Sale of Television Rights</em></p>\n<p id=\"ALso\">AIAW contends that NCAA tied the purchase of television rights for its women\u2019s basketball championship game to the purchase of its men\u2019s counterpart. AIAW argues that such a tie is both a <em>per se </em>violation under section 1 and the unlawful means by which NCAA monopolized, attempted to monopolize, or gained a competitive advantage in women\u2019s sports in violation of section 2. The district court agreed that NCAA had sufficient economic power in men\u2019s basketball championships to appreciably restrain competition for the television rights in women\u2019s basketball championships. 558 F.Supp. at 498. It also found that a \u201cnot insubstantial\u201d amount of interstate commerce was affected. <em>Id. </em>The district court concluded, however, that NCAA in fact had not used this power to impose a tied sale on the television networks. <em>Id. </em>at 500. <em>See Jefferson Parish Hospital Dist. No. 2 v. Hyde, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 104 S.Ct. 1551, 1558, 80 L.Ed.2d 2 (1984) (forced sale of allegedly tied product essential to tie-in violation). AIAW again is faced with the heavy burden of demonstrating that the district court\u2019s factual conclusion was clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-6\">AIAW focuses on three points in attacking the district court\u2019s finding of no coercive tie. First, AIAW notes that NCAA requested CBS and NBC to respond to twenty-three \u201cconditions\u201d in submitting their bids for the men\u2019s championship. One such \u201ccondition\u201d requested the networks to assign a separate fee to NCAA\u2019s women\u2019s basketball championship game. R.E. at 509. Second, AIAW points out that both NBC and CBS felt obliged to submit such a bid. Finally, AIAW cites NCAA\u2019s awarding CBS its women\u2019s championship even though NBC\u2019s bid on the women\u2019s event was substantially higher. AIAW contends that these three facts, taken together, demonstrate conclusively that NCAA would sell its men\u2019s championship only to a network that agreed to purchase NCAA\u2019s women\u2019s championship. For the reasons presented below, we reject AIAW\u2019s argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-9\">The \u201cconditions\u201d submitted to CBS and NBC were more precisely a list of items on which NCAA requested the networks to articulate a clearly defined negotiating position. The list was prefaced by the following instructions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b687-10\">The NCAA Basketball Negotiations Committee requests that NBC [and CBS] Sports respond in written form to each of the items listed below. In those instances where the NCAA has stated its position, please indicate if NBC [and CBS] agree [ ] or disagree [ ] in each case. If NBC [or CBS] wishes to modify the NCAA\u2019s position in any way, it should do so in its written response. In any event, NBC [and CBS are] expected to fully clarify [their] positions] on each of the items listed below____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b687-12\">R.E. at 508. These instructions do not require the networks to agree with NCAA on any of the items for negotiation to purchase the television rights for the men\u2019s championship. Indeed, NCAA assumed no position with regard to the value .of its women\u2019s championship game, but simply asked the networks for their view of its economic worth. We find nothing in NCAA\u2019s submission to the networks that indicates the men\u2019s event would be sold only to one who also purchased the women\u2019s event.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-13\">The district court found, as AIAW asserts, that NBC and CBS felt obliged to submit some bid for NCAA\u2019s women\u2019s championship. 558 F.Supp. at 499. The networks\u2019 bids, however, represent only their acknowledgment of practical commer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>cial reality: Buyers must give some response to a seller\u2019s proposal if negotiations are to proceed in an orderly fashion. R.E. at 444. We find no evidence demonstrating that had either network assigned a value of zero to the women\u2019s event, the possibility of purchasing the men\u2019s event would have been foreclosed.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Indeed, the President of NBC Sports and head of NBC\u2019s negotiating team testified that he did not consider the coverage of the women\u2019s championship to be a significant part of the negotiations for the men\u2019s tournament. <em>Id. </em>Most important, AIAW has cited no evidence demonstrating that CBS was coerced into purchasing a tied product for which it had no use.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b688-4\">Finally, AIAW argues that NCAA\u2019s intent to impose a tying arrangement on the networks was demonstrated by NCAA\u2019s awarding the <em>women\u2019s </em>championship to the network that submitted the higher bid for the <em>men\u2019s </em>championship.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> AIAW contends that NCAA\u2019s refusal to award each event separately to the higher bidder demonstrates that the two events were inextricably and unlawfully knotted. Given, however, the potential efficiencies of awarding the men\u2019s and women\u2019s championships to the same network, we cannot presume a coercive tie between two products from the sole fact that both products were sold to the same bidder.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b688-11\">In short, we find sufficient evidence to support the district court\u2019s conclusion that coverage of the women\u2019s championship game was not a <em>sine qua non </em>of a contract <em>for the </em>men\u2019s. Consequently, we reject AIAW\u2019s claim that NCAA\u2019s sale of television rights constitutes anti-competitive conduct violative either of section 1 or section 2 of the Sherman Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-12\">III. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b688-13\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the district court\u2019s holding that AIAW failed to prove NCAA\u2019s dues policy, proceeds distribution formula, or sale of television rights violated the Sherman Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-14\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b678-6\">.

The district court defined the relevant sub-markets as the men\u2019s and women\u2019s intercollegiate sports programs. 558 F.Supp. at 497.

In <em>Marjorie Webster, </em>this court held that the Sherman Act did not apply to an allegedly exclusionary accreditation policy because it found the policy \"distinct from the sphere of commerce.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 655. The court noted, however, that if it had discerned a commercial intent it could well have concluded that the educational facade of the accreditation policy only camouflaged a scheme very much directed at commerce. <em>Id. </em>at 654-55.

AIAW nevertheless cites the testimony of several witnesses who indicated their instutitions moved to NCAA in part because they feared \"bucking the leadership\u201d of NCAA.

The district court noted the following reasons cited by NCAA witnesses for moving to NCAA: NCAA\u2019s superior management and promotional resources, its philosophic emphasis on competitive excellence as distinguished from maximum participation irrespective of ability, its future promise of a uniform rules structure for both sexes, and championship competitions by conferences (comprised of institutions of comparable proficiency located in several states) rather than by \"state\u201d and \"region\u201d in which teams tend to be of disparate ability. 558 F.Supp. at 506. <em>See, e.g., </em>R.E. at 180-81, 388-89; Cerra Deposition (Dep.) at 3-8; Finch Dep. at 11-13; Frank Dep. at 8-9, 12; Holland Dep. at 4-7; ^Toner Dep. at 4-8.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b686-5\">.

AIAW then emphasizes the market division between men\u2019s and women's sports, and notes that NCAA neither raised its dues nor charged a separate fee upon introducing women\u2019s sports. AIAW concludes that NCAA offered a separate product at no charge, the cost of which was subsidized by monopoly profits from men\u2019s sports.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-6\">We reject AIAW\u2019s characterization. <em>See, e.g., Jones v.

Both parties stipulated that NCAA\u2019s generating revenues derive primarily from championships and the sale of television rights.

If NCAA\u2019s dues charge is seen as its price for participation in NCAA events, we would be forced to conclude that NCAA prices below cost virtually every sports program it offers.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-7\">Second, the logic of predatory pricing does not readily apply to the facts at hand. Pricing below cost has been held unlawful on the ground that it allows the predator to drive weaker competitors from the market and then reap monopoly profits before new competitors can enter the market. <em>See, e.g., William Inglis &amp; Sons Baking Co. v. ITT Continental Baking Co., </em>668 F.2d 1014, 1031-32 (9th Cir.1981), <em>cert. denied, </em>459 U.S. 825, 103 S.Ct. 57, 58, 74 L.Ed.2d 61 (1982). In the instant case, however, it would be nonsensical to presume NCAA\u2019s members were lowering the price of NCAA women's sports to drive AIAW from the market in order thereafter to charge <em>themselves </em>monopoly prices. Additionally, there is nothing in the record that implies NCAA could or believed it could extract monopoly profits from the networks for the right to televise women\u2019s sports by driving AIAW from the market.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b686-11\">. Other courts have indicated that regulations governing noncommercial activity are unlikely to produce significant anticompetitive effects. <em>See, e.g., Marjorie Webster Jr. College, Inc. v. Middle States Ass'n of Colleges and Secondary Schools, Inc., </em>432 F.2d 650, 654-55 (D.C.Cir.) (school accreditation policy), <em>cert. denied, </em>400 U.S. 965, 91 S.Ct. 367, 27 L.Ed.2d 384 (1970); <em>Nara v. American Dental Ass\u2019n, </em>526 F.Supp. 452, 457-58 (W.D.Mich.1981) (regulations prohibiting misleading advertising, false claims of specialists status, and use of unlicensed personnel); <em>Selman v. Harvard Medical School, </em>494 F.Supp. 603, 621 (S.D.N.Y.) (medical schools\u2019 admissions policies), <em>aff\u2019d, </em>636 F.2d 1024 (2d Cir.1980); <em>Jones v. NCAA, 392 </em>F.Supp. 295, 303-04 (D.Mass.1975) (eligibility standards for intercollegiate athletics). We do not assert that regulations governing noncommercial activity are exempt from the Sherman Act, Rather, we assert only that such regulations carry less potential of significantly restraining commerce than do regulations governing commercial activity.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b686-12\">. AIAW also claimed that NCAA's dues policy and proceeds distribution formula represented joint conduct by which NCAA members restrained trade in violation of section 1 of the Sherman Act. Because AIAW failed to prove a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>causal connection between NCAA\u2019s dues and reimbursement policies and AIAW\u2019s economic injury, those policies may not be used as a predicate for a section 1 violation. <em>See Davis-Watkins Co. v. Service Merchandise, </em>686 F.2d 1190, 1195-96 (6th Cir.1982). We therefore affirm the district court's holding that neither practice transgressed section 1 or 3 of the Sherman Act. We note, however, that we have no occasion to review, and thus do not affirm, the district court's finding that these NCAA practices did not represent the <em>joint </em>conduct necessary for all section 1 violations. 558 F.Supp. at 498-99.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b688-5\">. NCAA Executive Director Walter Byers, who was NCAA\u2019s primary negotiator with the networks, testified that AIAW's claim regarding the tying arrangement was unfounded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b688-6\">[W]e did <em>not </em>condition purchase of the rights to the men\u2019s championship on purchase of the women\u2019s championship. To the best of my knowledge, CBS, which got the contract, affirmatively wanted the rights to our women's basketball championship; and it also affirmatively proposed to buy the rights to the NCAA women's gymnastic championship.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b688-7\">R.E. at 383-84.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b688-8\">. In addition to the men\u2019s and women\u2019s basketball championship, CBS bought the television rights to five other NCAA championships, two of which involved women\u2019s sports. The minutes of the NCAA\u2019s final negotiations with CBS for the sale of television rights indicate that CBS believed that even these other championships represented \"good, strong legitimate programming.\u201d R.E. at 425.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-9\">AIAW concedes that it has no personal knowledge that NCAA tied the rights to its women\u2019s championship to those for its men's championship. 558 F.Supp. at 500. AIAW offers as circumstantial evidence of CBS\u2019s lack of interest in the women\u2019s championship CBS\u2019s failure to carry any women\u2019s collegiate championship before 1981. We do not find the sole fact that CBS changed its business strategy conclusive proof of NCAA\u2019s forcing the women\u2019s championship on CBS. AIAW must proffer more persuasive evidence to demonstrate the clearly erroneous quality of the district court\u2019s factual finding of no coercive tying arrangement.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b688-16\">. NBC bid $525,000 for the women\u2019s event and $45 million for the men\u2019s. CBS bid $225,000 for the women's event and $48 million for the men\u2019s. 558 F.Supp. at 499. CBS's bid for the women\u2019s championship was later increased to $375,000 pursuant to NCAA\u2019s request. <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b688-17\">. NCAA could well have found the promotional and administrative efficiencies of awarding both championships to the same network worth more than the extra $300,000 NBC offered for the women\u2019s event. Such promotional efficiencies may include direct access during each event to an audience specifically interested in college basketball. Moreover, commentators\u2019 endorsements of the women's event during telecasts of the men's championship may be particularly effective in stimulating viewership for the women's championship. Also, a network may find it easier to encourage affiliates to cover women\u2019s basketball after the affiliate has already cultivated an audience for men\u2019s college basketball.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b688-18\">Administrative efficiencies may include securing uniform policies on commercial format, station breaks, and payment schedules for all NCAA basketball telecasts.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
