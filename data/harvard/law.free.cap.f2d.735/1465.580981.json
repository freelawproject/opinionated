A transponder picks up information broadcast to a satellite by a \u201ctransmit\u201d earth station, amplifies it, and relays it back to any \u201creceive\u201d earth station tuned into that satellite. The domsats in the matter before us, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1468\">*1468</page-number>in the main, are or will be equipped with twenty-four operational transponders per satellite.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Domsat operators generally have leased transponders on a common carrier basis in accordance with the \u201cjust and reasonable\u201d tariff strictures of the Communications Act. <em>See </em>Communications Act of 1934 tit. II, 47 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 201-224 (1976 &amp; Supp. y 1981). In the orders on review, the Federal Communications .Commission (FCC or Commission) authorized the sale of certain discrete transponders on a noncom-mon carrier basis. <em>Domestic Fixed-Satellite Transponder Sales, </em>90 FCC2d 1238 (1982) <em>(Transponder Sales Order).</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The Commission\u2019s decision, -we conclude, is within its statutory authority and is adequately reasoned; we therefore affirm the FCC\u2019s orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b1566-4\">The Commission has made a modest adjustment. It has not displaced regulated common carrier service as the dominant mode for domsat operations.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> It has agreed to entertain transponder sale applications on a case-by-case basis. Simultaneously, the FCC announced its intention to disallow sales should it \u201cdevelop that ... additional transponders are required for users who need common carrier service[ ].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1255.</p>\n<p id=\"b1566-5\">Rapid technological advances, demand shifts, and changes in entrepreneurial judgments regarding satellite design and marketing have marked the period since 1974, when the first commercial domsat was orbited.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Appropriately, the FCC has not attempted to impose an inflexible regulatory regime on an industry \u201ccharacterized by fluidity.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1247. Instead, the Commission has proceeded tentatively in an effort to develop sensible regulatory approaches responsive to the public interest. For this task, it has received no new instructions from Congress. Its sole guide from the legislature is the Communications Act,, passed in 1934, decades before the advent of domsats.</p>\n<p id=\"b1566-11\">We confront on review an arcane, fast-moving field of technology, opposing estimates of down the road supply and demand derived from currently available information, and no congressional action geared specifically to the new, burgeoning domsat industry. In these circumstances a reviewing court owes particular deference to the expert administrative agency\u2019s policy judgments and predictions, its forecasts of \u201cthe direction in which future public interest lies.\u201d <em>FCC v. WNCN Listeners Guild, </em>450 U.S. 582, 595 (1981) (quoting <em>FCC v. National Citizens Committee for Broadcasting, </em>436 U.S. 775, 814, 98 S.Ct. 2096, 2121, 56 L.Ed.2d 697 (1978)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1567-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1469\">*1469</page-number>We are persuaded by the record that the FCC, in authorizing a limited departure from the status quo, acted within its discretion. Petitioners assert that the Commission ruled outside its delegated authority and did not engage in reasoned decision-making; neither contention survives review faithful to our precedent. <em>See, e.g., Office of Communication of the United Church of Christ v. FCC, </em>707 F.2d 1413 (D.C.Cir.1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b1567-5\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b1567-6\">The Commission first invited applications for commercial domestic satellite service in 1970. <em>Domestic Communication-Satellite Facilities, </em>22 FCC2d 86 (1970) <em>(Domsat I). </em>At that time, the FCC recognized the potentially significant contribution domsats could make to the nation\u2019s communications system, <em>id. </em>at 89-90, but it had not yet determined basic issues \u2014 whether satellites should be special-purpose or multipurpose, whether they should be operated by a governmental corporation or by private industry. In soliciting concrete proposals, the Commission announced:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1567-7\">[W]e will consider applications by all legally, technically, and financially qualified entities proposing the establishment and operation of domestic communications satellite systems .... Applicants may propose the rendition of such services directly to the public on a common carrier basis or by the lease of facilities to other common carriers, or any combination of such arrangements. Applicants may also propose private ownership and use or the joint cooperative use of the system by the several owners thereof. Applicants may further propose the shared use of some facilities by different systems, or a division in the ownership of various system components (e.g., user ownership of earth stations to afford direct access to the space segment of a common carrier or cooperative system).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1567-10\"><em>Id. </em>at 93-94 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1567-11\">Two years later, the FCC settled on a policy under which legally, financially, and technically qualified private entities could receive domsat authorizations upon a showing that the proposed service would inure to the public benefit. <em>Domestic Communications-Satellite Facilities, </em>35 FCC2d 844 (1972) <em>(Domsat II). </em>In stating the objectives of its regulatory policy,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the Commission underscored that it sought</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1567-12\">to retain leeway and flexibility ... [in] the use of satellite technology for domestic communications so as to make such adjustments therein as future experience and circumstances may dictate.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1567-13\"><em>Id. </em>at 847. The FCC did not rule definitively that all domestic satellite service must be offered under a regulated common carrier regime. In fact, however, the authorizations it issued for currently operating commercial domsats called for common carrier service \u2014 the leasing of transponders, generally on a first-come, first-served basis, <em>see </em>47 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 201(a); 202, pursuant to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1470\">*1470</page-number>\u201cjust and reasonable\u201d cost-based tariffs. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 201(b), 203.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1568-4\">In 1979 the FCC proposed reduced dom-sat regulation; it saw the communications marketplace in which domsats figured as essentially competitive. <em>Competitive Carrier Rulemaking, </em>77 FCC2d 308 (1979); <em>see Competitive Carrier Rulemaking, </em>85 FCC2d 1, 26 (1980). In 1980, however, the Commission decided against any instant de-regulatory step. <em>Competitive Carrier Rulemaking, </em>85 FCC2d at 26-27. It observed that in recent months demand for transponder space had grown to exceed supply.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> That situation might persist for the immediate future, the Commission conjectured, because of \u201ctechnical limit[s] on the number of satellites that will be operating in the near term.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 27. The FCC reached the decision to defer relaxed regulation with misgivings, and stated that it would engage in \u201ccontinuing assessment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 11. It cautioned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1568-5\">[I]t is not clear that consumers are better off with rate regulation of the Domsats. If prices for transponder space are constrained, the market power is transferred to Domsat resale carriers. If, in turn, the prices of the resale carriers are constrained by regulation, it is likely that the windfall rents will be reaped by firms, such as cable systems and program suppliers, rather than the general populace. Under such conditions, the benefits of regulation are questionable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1568-10\"><em>Id. </em>at 26 .<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1568-11\">In 1981 the Commission again proposed relaxed rate regulation of domsats. <em>Competitive Carrier Rulemaking, </em>84 FCC2d 445 (1981). It suggested that consumers were not the beneficiaries of the lower rates Commission regulation then required; that allowing market prices to rise would promote the development of satellite technology; and that technological innovation, when spurred by price allocation mechanisms, could provide ample opportunities for an increase in the supply of transponder capacity. The advantages of reduced regulation, the FCC forecast, would in the long run outweigh any detrimental impact of price increases in the short run. <em>Id. </em>at 507-08. The Commission had not taken final action on this proposal by the date the <em>Transponder Sales Order </em>issued.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1569-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1471\">*1471</page-number>II. The Commission\u2019s Decision</p>\n<p id=\"ALt1\">In the <em>Transponder Sales Order, </em>the Commission authorized domestic satellite communications system licensees to make a limited part of their transmission capacity available to end users through sales of transponders on specific satellites. A transponder sale contract conveys to the purchaser an exclusive ownership right in a specific transponder during its useful life. The purchaser may use the property thus acquired as collateral for loans, and may enjoy certain tax benefits as a result of transponder ownership \u2014 notably, accelerated depreciation deductions and investment tax credits. The satellite owner, however, retains responsibility for the operation of the satellite. Sale transactions are not subject to the first-come, first-served allocation mechanism of common carrier service. Buyers negotiate the .right to use specific transponders directly with the satellite operator, sometimes even before the satellite is launched. The price is set by contract and is not subject to government regulation.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1569-7\">The Commission limited its authorization to the specific applications before it.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> It permitted Hughes Communications, Inc. (Hughes) to sell all twenty-four transponders on its Galaxy I satellite,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> RCA American Communications, Inc. (RCA Americom) to sell five of the twenty-four transponders on its Satcom IV satellite, and Western Union Telegraph Co. (Western Union) to sell a total of eleven transponders on two satellites. Both Hughes and RCA Ameri-com have sold transponders only to cable programmers; Western Union has offered its transponders for the provision of other communications services.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1570-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1472\">*1472</page-number>In explaining its decision, the Commission first discussed the potential benefits of the proposed transactions.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Transponder sales, it found, would provide a means for would-be satellite operators to raise the capital needed to enter the market;<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> further, sales would provide a mechanism for gauging demand, and would facilitate risk sharing. Sellers would have an incentive to innovate by designing systems to fit particular users\u2019 needs. Buyers could plan ahead with the assurance that desired satellite capacity will be available to them at a set price when they need it. Sales transac-. tions could be structured to meet the specific needs of particular satellite operators and end users; and satellite operators, through their selection of purchasers, could take advantage of complementarities among users.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1570-4\">Supported by comments from the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Justice, the FCC rejected arguments, based on supply scarcity assumptions or projections, made by opponents of transponder sales. Opponents argued that because \u201cdomsat facilities are currently scarce resources ... the domsat licensee will be able to obtain supranormal profits for its services.\u201d <em>Transponder Sales Order, </em>90 FCC2d at 1244. They maintained that demand for satellite service would continue to exceed supply for the foreseeable future; that transponder sales would be ineffective in stimulating supply, in view of technical constraints on the number of satellites that could be launched; and that transponder sales would limit satellite service availability to those with \u201cenormous financial resources.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1245. The Commission, however, noted that as of early 1981 it had authorized the construction of twenty-five new satellites and the launch of twenty new or previously constructed satellites;<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> and it forecast that new satellite construction would meet or exceed the anticipated transponder demand. Authorizations now in place, it found, would without more result in a quadrupling of domestic satellite capacity within the next five years. Technological developments could further boost transponder availability by reducing orbital spacing, opening up new frequency bands, and increasing transponder efficiency. The Commission referred to a then pending proposal to reduce orbital spacing; that proposal was in fact adopted, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1473\">*1473</page-number>with modifications, roughly a year after the <em>Transponder Sales Order </em>issued.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1571-5\">The Commission pointed out that the long lead time between initial FCC authorization of a satellite and the satellite\u2019s actual commercial operation had contributed to a \u201clag\u201d between the late 1970s \u201cunexpected surge in demand for transponders and the construction and launch of new satellites sufficient to satisfy that demand.\u201d 90 FCC2d at 1250. It concluded, however, that the shortage (which had followed initial years in which \u201cconsiderable operative capacity sat dormant\u201d) was temporary in view of construction underway. <em>See id. </em>at 1252-53.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1571-6\">There was \u201cno substance,\u201d the Commission said, to the prediction that its limited sales allowance would drastically curtail the number of transponders left for common carrier service. <em>Id. </em>at 1253. It was permitting a relatively small number of sales, <em>id. </em>at 1253-54; \u201cthe large majority of transponders should remain available on a common carrier basis.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1254. Small users, the FCC concluded, again in agreement with the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission, would not be shut out of the transponder market; on the contrary, small users who could not afford straight monthly lease arrangements might be positioned to finance a transponder purchase aided by the associated tax benefits and the ability to pledge the transponder as a tangible asset. <em>Id. </em>at 1254-55. Several small users supported the sales authorization, and cited this prospect in their comments. <em>See, e.g., </em>Reply Comments of Vitalink Communications Corp. at 4-5, <em>reprinted in </em>J.A. 298, 301 \u2014 02; Letter from Equatorial Communications to James R. Keegan, Chief, Domestic Facilities Division, Common Carrier Bureau, FCC (Feb. 19, 1982), <em>reprinted in </em>Comments of Western Union Telegraph Co. at 15, <em>reprinted in </em>J.A. 172, 177.</p>\n<p id=\"b1571-11\">Finally, the Commission reiterated: \u201cWe will, of course, continue to scrutinize every application ---- [Additional non-common carrier satellites will not be authorized if it should develop that their certification would not inure to the public interest (for example, if we find that additional transponders are required for users who need common carrier service.).\u201d 90 FCC2d at 1255. In their separate statements, Commissioners Jones and Rivera underlined the importance they attributed to the Commission\u2019s ease-by-case approach. <em>Id. </em>at 1279-80.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1571-13\">III. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b1571-14\">It is the Federal Communications Commission\u2019s mission to facilitate development of \u201cthe new and far-reaching science of broadcasting\u201d in harmony with the public interest. <em>See FCC v. Pottsville Broadcast</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1474\">*1474</page-number><em>ing Co., </em>309 U.S. 134, 137, 60 S.Ct. 437, 439, 84 L.Ed. 656 (1940) (Radio Act of 1927). Congress established two regimes under which the Commission is empowered to \u201cregulat[e] interstate and foreign commerce in communication by wire and radio so as to make available, so far as possible, to all the people of the United States a rapid, efficient, Nationwide, and worldwide wire and radio communication service with adequate facilities at reasonable charges.\u201d Communications Act of 1934, 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 151 (1976). First, in Title II of the Act, Congress provided for close FCC control over the service and charges of communications common carriers. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 201-224 (1976 &amp; Supp. V 1981). Second, in Title III, Congress provided for extensive licensing authority through which the FCC is to \u201cmaintain the control of the United States over all the channels of interstate and foreign radio transmission.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 301.</p>\n<p id=\"b1572-4\">In the orders under review, the Commission has authorized the provision of transponder service by satellite operators on a noncommon carrier basis \u2014 through sales on terms negotiated individually with selected purchasers. The authorization is not blanket. Each applicant must satisfy the Commission that the specifically described sales it proposes are in the public interest; the Commission, as part of its public interest analysis, has undertaken to determine whether sufficient common carrier transponder capacity will remain if the application is granted. <em>Transponder Sales Order, </em>90 FCC2d at 1255. If sales authorization is approved, the affected transponders are removed from Title II regulation. The domsat operator, however, remains fully subject to the Commission\u2019s Title III authority. This court\u2019s task, in appraising the Commission\u2019s orders, is to decide first, whether the Commission\u2019s decision is within the broad range of the FCC\u2019s delegated authority under the Communications Act, and if it is, whether the position the Commission has adopted is the product of a rational decisionmaking process. <em>Office of Communication of the United Church of Christ v. FCC, </em>707 F.2d 1413, 1422 (D.C.Cir.1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b1572-7\">A. <em>Delegated Authority</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1572-8\">As noted earlier, <em>see supra </em>note 10, both petitioners acknowledge that the transponder sales the Commission has authorized are noncommon carrier offerings. They maintain, however, that the Commission is obliged to fasten on domsat operators an exclusively common carrier regime and may not allow the marketplace to substitute for direct Commission regulation even where the FCC rationally finds that the public interest would be advanced thereby. <em>See </em>Brief for Petitioner/Appellant Satellite Syndicated Services, Inc. at 28-29 (SSS Brief); <em>see also </em>Brief for Petitioner-Appellant Wold Communications, Inc. at 26-27 (Wold Brief). This is unpersuasive argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b1572-9\">From its initial venture in this area, the FCC contemplated the prospect of both common carrier and noneommon carrier operations. <em>Domsat I, </em>22 FCC2d at 93.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> For the first generation of domsats, the Commission generally provided for the offering of service on a common carrier basis. In line with the rapid growth and development of this new industry, the FCC has now made a moderate adjustment: (1) the Commission continues to exercise Title II common carrier regulatory authority with respect to the large majority of transponders; (2) it is exercising Title III authority to determine whether each proposed noncommon carrier transponder sale is in the public interest; (3) it has stated that a key concern in its public interest evaluation is the adequacy of the remaining common carrier capacity to serve users\u2019 needs; (4) it has recognized its obligation to monitor the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1475\">*1475</page-number>results of the course it is pursuing, and to revise its position if changing circumstances so warrant. <em>Transponder Sales Order, </em>90 FCC2d at 1255.

But this court has no basis for concluding that the Commission is not proceeding, or does not intend to proceed, in the manner stated in the principal decision on review. The Commission has emphasized its commitment to scrutinize each request for noncommon carrier transponder offerings to ensure the application\u2019s consistency with the public interest. <em>Transponder Sales Order, </em>90 FCC2d at 1255.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> It reaffirmed its transponder-by-transponder authorization policy in <em>Western Union Telegraph Co., </em>FCC 83-54 (released Feb. 9, 1983), <em>reprinted in </em>Brief for FCC and United States at B-l, and has stated guiding reasons for its approval of transponder sales applications. <em>See Licensing Space Stations in the Domestic-Fixed Satellite Service, </em>FCC 83-184 (released Aug. 16, 1983) at 40-42 (effect of granting the application on relative size of noncommon carrier portion of satellite services market); <em>Southern Pacific Satellite Co., </em>92 FCC2d 666 (1982) (percentage of satellite\u2019s authorized in-orbit capacity proposed to be made available on a noncommon carrier basis, and effect of granting the application on relative size of noncommon carrier portion of satellite services market). The Commission has not stated a precise bright-line test, perhaps reflecting its concern that a simple comparison of the percentage of common carrier transponders with the percentage of noncommon carrier transponders may not in every case satisfy the Commission\u2019s obligation to determine whether transponder sales certification is in the public interest. We expect that the Commission will in all cases seriously examine transponder sales applications in light of all factors relevant to the public interest calculus, and will monitor the results of the course it is pursuing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1574-6\">B. <em>Rational Decisionmaking</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1574-7\">In determining whether the Commission reached its decision rationally, not arbitrarily or capriciously, this court\u2019s office is limited.

This exaggerates both fact and law. The FCC recognized at the outset that, although it had issued space station authorizations before \u201cnot in the traditional common carrier mold,\u201d transponder sales did \u201crepresent a significant departure from the manner in which satellite service has generally been provided.\u201d <em>Transponder Sales Order, </em>90 FCC2d at 1247, 1248. \u201cThis is [therefore] not a case where an agency altered course without acknowledging or recognizing the change.\u201d <em>Black Citizens for a Fair Media v.

Nor is there evidence in the record that \u201calternatives\u201d other than \u201cno change\u201d were suggested to the Commission. <em>State Farm </em>is therefore inapposite to the situation presented here.</p>\n<p id=\"b1575-6\">The Commission\u2019s analysis of supply and demand is criticized heatedly by petitioners,<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> but we find adequate support for it in the record. As earlier observed, <em>see supra </em>note 19, petitioners prefer the dated studies they cited<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> to the more recent one credited by the Commission. It is not our role to second guess the FCC\u2019s plausible evaluation of these submissions. <em>See National Broadcasting Co. v.

Moreover, even if we accept petitioners\u2019 estimates of short-term demand, it appears that the supply of transponders will match that demand in the current decade. <em>Compare id. </em>at 1275 (Fo-garty, Commissioner, dissenting) (projections of transponder demand), <em>with id. </em>at 1262-65 (opinion of the Commission) (expected transponder supply).</p>\n<p id=\"b1575-12\">Petitioners fault the Commission for unduly emphasizing the future over the here and now; they charge that the FCC \u201cfail[ed] to take note that the long lead planning time involved would indicate that satellites <em>under construction </em>now are of no use to customers who desire <em>service now.\u201d </em>SSS Brief at 7 (emphasis in original); <em>see also </em>Wold Brief at 17. This argument does not warrant overturning the Commission\u2019s decision. Petitioners them<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1478\">*1478</page-number>selves neglect to note that the majority of transponders whose sales the <em>Transponder Sales Order </em>authorized were On a satellite then \u201cunder construction,\u201d and thus were unrelated to \u201cservice now.\u201d Further, the Commission was well aware of \u201ca three to five year lead time before [satellite systems can] become operational.\u201d <em>Transponder Sales Order, </em>90 FCC2d at 1250. Its opinion does not discuss at length immediate short-term impacts. Even in the short term, however, the Commission saw no danger that transponder sales would \u201cdrastically curtail the availability of transponders left for common carrier use.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1253. Reading the Commission\u2019s opinion as a whole, we find sufficient indication that the agency adequately considered short-term impacts and rationally concluded that the difficulties any moderate short-term dislocation presented would be outweighed by the long-term benefits of its authorizations. <em>See id. </em>at 1251-55.</p>\n<p id=\"b1576-5\">Petitioners see caprice in the Commission\u2019s view that there is a benefit to the public in the risk sharing and flexible financing transponder sales permit. This incentive is not needed, petitioners urge, for despite the absence of transponder sales in the past, applications for authorization to construct and launch satellites have exceeded available orbital slots. <em>See </em>SSS Brief at 8-9; Wold Brief at 21-23. The FCC, however, took into account technological developments promising \u201csubstantial opportunities for expansion of satellite services and additional market entry,\u201d as well as prospects for increasing the orbital positions available for new satellites.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> <em>Transponder Sales Order, </em>90 FCC2d at 1254. Petitioners call the FCC\u2019s discussion \u201cspeculation.\u201d But the FCC\u2019s forecasts have support in the record;<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> they are judgments of the very sort the Commission must make if it is to avoid governing tomorrow by standards shaped for yesterday. As the Supreme Court instructed this court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1577-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1479\">*1479</page-number>[T]he Commission\u2019s decisions must sometimes rest on judgment and prediction rather than pure factual determinations.

In addressing the impact of its action on small users, <em>Transponder Sales Order, </em>90 FCC2d at 1254-55, the FCC was guided by the comments of small and medium-sized users <em>favoring </em>transponder sales. <em>See, e.g., </em>Comments of Turner Broadcasting System, <em>reprinted in </em>J.A. 73-76 (medium-sized user with nationwide viewing audience). No small or medium-sized cable programmer appears in this court to complain about the Commission\u2019s decision; two\u2014 Spanish International Network and Turner Broadcasting System \u2014 appear in support of the Commission\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b1577-7\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b1577-8\">Petitioners, in much of their argument, tell the court in many words that the FCC\u2019s decision is in their view \u201cunwise, ... not likely to succeed in accomplishing what the Commission intended.\u201d <em>National Broadcasting Co. v.

The only response a reviewing court, mindful of its limited role, should give to arguments thus forecasting failure of the agency\u2019s design is that the complainants \u201chave selected the wrong forum for such a plea.\u201d <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>31</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1577-11\">The Commission\u2019s effort to serve the public interest in the matter at hand is adequately reasoned and within the broad charter Congress gave it.

The Commission concluded that the applications of three domsat operators to sell rather than lease a limited number of transponders were not subject to common carriage regulation and were in the public interest.

Only a portion of the orbital arc is visible from points within the United States, and thus usable to provide domestic satellite service. <em>See Domestic Fixed-Satellite Service, 88 </em>FCC2d 318, 320 (1981).

The studies acknowledged that transponder sales may allow a satellite owner to reap greater profits, but emphasized that those profits would provide the wherewithal for system expansion and improvement. <em>See </em>Besen, <em>supra </em>note 8, at 8, <em>reprinted in </em>J.A. 136, 144; Jonscher, <em>supra </em>note 5, at 3, <em>reprinted in </em>J.A. 272, 276 (\"[I]n the interest of avoiding purely speculative profit-taking and of rewarding the industry which is best positioned to develop the spectrum resource in the long run, available surplus profits are better assigned to the providers rather than to lessors of satellite systems.\u2019\u2019); <em>see also </em>Comments of Federal Trade Commission at 6, <em>reprinted in </em>J.A. 293, 296-A.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b1570-10\">.

Petitioners Wold Communications, Inc. and Satellite Syndicated Systems, Inc., and interve-nor MCI Telecommunications Corp., challenge the Commission's action. The FCC\u2019s suggestion, Brief for FCC and United States at 26 n. 29, that MCI is barred from intervening, is insubstantial. MCI\u2019s intervention in No. 82-2055, a petition for review pursuant to 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 402(a), is sup<em>ported </em>by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2348, which provides that <em>any </em>person \u201cwhose interests are affected by\u201d the agency order may intervene in the proceeding for review. MCI's intervention in No. 82-2054, a direct appeal pursuant to 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 402(b), is similarly secure. 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 402(e).,permits <em>any </em>\"interested\u201d person to intervene in a \u00a7 402(b) appeal. Section 405 of the Communications Act requires that a person not a party below file a petition for rehearing as a condition precedent to seeking judicial review. But nothing in the statute imposes a rehearing petition requirement on would-be intervenors, as distinguished from appellants. An intervenor, like an appellant, is precluded from raising issues upon which the Commission was not given an opportunity to pass. <em>See generally Action for Children\u2019s Television v. FCC, </em>564 F.2d 458, 468-69 (D.C.Cir.1977). MCI's arguments, however, cannot fairly be so characterized.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b1572-5\">.

The Commission found that the studies petitioners cited overprojected the number of transponders needed by underprojecting the capacity of individual transponders and satellites. <em>See Transponder Sales Order, </em>90 FCC2d at 1250 n. 28; <em>see also Competitive Common Carrier Rule-making, </em>FCC 83-481 (released Nov. 2, 1983), at 19 n. 49.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"27\">\n<p id=\"b1575-9\">. Petitioners indict the Commission\u2019s conclusions about supply and demand as inconsistent with the FCC\u2019s characterization of domestic satellite operators as \"dominant\" in <em>Competitive Carrier Rulemaking, </em>85 FCC2d 1 (1980). In that ruling, however, the FCC anticipated \u201ccontinuing assessment.\u201d <em>See supra </em>p. 6. The <em>Transponder Sales Order </em>is consistent with the Commission\u2019s representation that the matter would remain under review. <em>See Western Union Telegraph Co. v. FCC, </em>674 F.2d 160, 164-65 (2d Cir.1982) (elimination of specific regulatory control not \"unexplained departure\" from earlier decision maintaining it where prior decision had found that control was economically inefficient but necessary under then-existing conditions). Petitioners\u2019 apparent argument that the Commission was locked into the status quo while the \"dominant\" label remained in place, <em>see </em>Wold Brief at 23; SSS Brief at 39-42, is unpersuasive. The Commission is not obliged to forgo a measured change and await a day uncertain when conditions justify a broader departure from a prior ruling. <em>See Transponder Sales Order, </em>90 FCC2d at 1254 &amp; n. 38 (Commission need not decide \"whether the common carrier operations of domsats should be streamlined or deregulated\u201d in order to conclude, in agreement with the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission, that domsat licensees \"do not possess the significant market power required to impair the reasonable availability of transponder supply.\u2019\u2019).</p>\n<p id=\"b1575-14\">In fact, the Commission did classify domsats as nondominant just over a year after the <em>Transponder Sales Order </em>issued. <em>Competitive Common Carrier Services, </em>FCC 83-481 (released Nov. 2, 1983). <em>See supra </em>note 9.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"28\">\n<p id=\"b1576-4\">. The Commission mentioned in its decision that the number of available orbital locations might ,be increased by 50% to 100% through reduced orbital spacing, a matter then pending before it. The orbital spacing proceeding concluded about a year later. It increased orbital locations by 50% in the 12/14 GHz band and by 50% to 100%, with an ultimate increase of 100%, in the 4/6 GHz band. Licensing of Space Stations in the <em>Domestic Fixed-Satellite Service, </em>FCC 83-184 (Aug. 16, 1983). Petitioners describe the Commission\u2019s reference in the <em>Transponder Sales Order </em>to the then pending orbital spacing proceeding as \u201cprejudg[mentj.\" SSS Brief at 11. In some circumstances such a Commission reference would be troubling. For example, we would hesitate to sanction an agency\u2019s announcement of, and reliance on, the result of a pending proceeding where the notice- and-comment docket in that proceeding had not yet closed. <em>Cf. Action on Smoking and Health v. CAB, </em>699 F.2d 1209, 1216 (D.C.Cir.1983) (agency in rule-making proceeding must \"resolve[ ] any significant problems raised by the comments, and ... show how that resolution led [it] to the ultimate rule\") (quoting <em>Rodway v. United States Dep\u2019t of Agriculture, </em>514 F.2d 809, 817 (D.C.Cir.1975)). We find, however, no large cause for concern in the Commission\u2019s reference to the orbital spacing docket. The Commission did ' not dispositively rely on the orbital spacing proposal in formulating its rationale. The deadline for submission of reply comments in the orbital spacing proceeding had passed; that proceeding has concluded without substantial dissent or petition for review, significantly expanding the number of orbital locations.</p>\n<p id=\"b1576-7\">Commissioner Fogarty, dissenting from the <em>Transponder Sales Order, </em>disagreed with the Commission\u2019s position as to the efficacy of reduced orbital spacing, but he did not share the petitioners\u2019 view that the Commission should not have thought about reduced orbital spacing when it decided what to do about transponder sales. <em>See Transponder Sales Order, </em>90 FCC2d at 1273-74 (Fogarty, Commissioner, dissenting). Indeed, he found it \u201cnot unduly optimistic\" to predict that \"a reduction in spacing to 2.5 or 3 degrees will ultimately be adopted.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1274.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"29\">\n<p id=\"b1576-8\">. <em>See, e.g., </em>Jonscher, <em>supra </em>note 5, at 6, <em>reprinted in </em>J.A. 270 (technological development in the Ku and higher frequency bands).
