SMITH, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b642-16\">Petitioner Harold Brown (Brown) appeals from a decision of the Merit Systems Protection Board (board), affirming the decision of the Department of Transportation\u2019s Federal Aviation Administration (agency) to remove Brown from his position as a supervisory air traffic control specialist at the New York Air Traffic Control Center (TRACON), on the basis of a misconduct charge arising from comments, broadcast by the national media, which Brown made to striking air controllers. We affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-17\">\n<em>Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b642-18\">Brown had been an agency employee for nearly 25 years when he was removed, effective September 5, 1981. For the last 2 years of his employment Brown was one of some 21 first-line team supervisors at TRA-CON, each of whom supervised approximately nine air traffic controllers. During the period here at issue, Brown was not a member of the Professional Air Traffic Controllers\u2019 Organization (PATCO), the air controllers\u2019 labor union. At no time did Brown participate in the nationwide air con-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>trailers\u2019 strike which PATCO called on August 3, 1981, and which at TRACON was nearly wholly effective. In fact, Brown worked a 12-hour shift the first day of the strike, from 7 or 8 p.m. on August 3 to 7 or 8 a.m. the morning of August 4.</p>\n<p id=\"Ah6\">On the evening of August 4, 1981, during his off-duty hours, Brown went to the local union hall in Mine\u00f3la, New York, to advise his controllers that he was indeed still working.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He testified that he found himself at the podium where he first stated: \u201cI wish you\u2019d all come back, \u2019cause I\u2019m too tired and too old to be working these long hours. He then stated: I m so happy that you re together. Stay together, please, because if you do, you\u2019ll win.\u201d After he left the podium, Brown testified that he spoke to a television reporter and stated that the strike was \u2018illegal, but also said that \u201cI support some of the strike demands. Brown left the PATCO meeting shortly thereafter, having attended it, according to his testimony, no longer than a half hour to an hour.</p>\n<p id=\"A-EJ\">The atmosphere m which Brown spoke ,. ,, , , XT ,. , , , t . was highly charged. National television j , i i n cameras and reporters were present at the , n * ui. v <em>t, </em>, i union hall. Although Brown s remarks ,j. . while he was on the podium, with a microphone thrust in his hand, were brief, the portion of those remarks quoted above and concerning \u201cstay together\u201d were picked up by the media and broadcast nationwide that evening. Brown\u2019s supervisor was watching that particular television program; 24 hours later Brown received a letter from that supervisor proposing Brown\u2019s removal. The charge, misconduct, was stated as follows:<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"AWr\"><em>Reason 2: </em>Misconduct</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AIAe\"><em>Specification: </em>Your appearance in Mineola, New York, on August 4, 1981, before a cluster group of striking con-trailers was reported by Richard Anderson of ABC News on the ABC News Program, \u201cNightline,\u201d a nationwide Network TV Broadcast beginning at 11:30 P.M. EDT on August 4, 1981. The reporter identified you as an FAA supervisor- The statements you made to the controllers contradicted the public orders by the President for striking controllers to return to duty, as well as the telegraphic message of August 3, 1981, (copy of text enclosed), directing striking controllers to report for duty,</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A9i\">Brown again appeared on the ABC news program, \u201cNightline,\u201d the evening of Au-gugt g&gt; 1981&gt; following his receipt August 5 of the notice of hig pr0posed removal. The reporter interviewed Brown briefly and ran again the yideo dip of BroWs \u00abgtay to. ther\u201e remarkg from twQ eveni bef ag a <em>m </em>to that gt</p>\n<p id=\"a9y-dedup-0\">Brown appealed his removal to the board which, in an initial decision dated August 23, 1982, ordered the agency to cancel its , \u2019 . , \u201c , . . removal action and restore Brown to his . , m. .... ...... former position.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The presiding official , , ,, f , . . , based this decision on the first amendment . ., , _ protection provided Brown s speech, as that . _ r \u00b0f a Government employee, m that context, The fu\u201c board reversfd (one member dissentm?&gt; atnd tam?d the re\u2122val on the Sround *at Browns remarks were not constitutionally protected.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Brown appeals * 1S courb</p>\n<p id=\"avj-dedup-0\">\n<em>Issues</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AQ31\">We address first the issue whether Brawn\u2019s speech was constitutionally protected. Since we find that it was not, we next address the question whether a nexus existed between Brown\u2019s off-duty remarks <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>as supervisor and the efficiency of the agency\u2019s operations. Finding that this nexus existed, we discuss the appropriateness of the penalty imposed and remand for mitigation of that penalty.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-4\">\n<em>Opinion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b644-5\">1. <em>First Amendment Protection</em></p>\n<p id=\"amm-dedup-0\">Government employees may exercise their first amendment rights without fear of retaliatory dismissal in certain circumstances. The Supreme Court has stated the test for determining the extent to which the state may regulate the speech of its employees:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b644-6\">The problem in any case is to arrive at a balance between the interests of the * * [employee], as a citizen, in commenting upon matters of public concern and the interest of the State, as an employer, in promoting the efficiency of the public services it performs through its employees.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b644-7\">We must therefore apply the <em>Pickering </em>test by determining (1) whether Brown\u2019s speech addressed a matter of public concern and, if so, (2) whether the interest of the agency in promoting the efficiency of the public service it performs (air traffic control) outweighed Brown\u2019s interests as a citizen.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b644-8\">In deciding whether Brown\u2019s remarks addressed a matter of public concern, we must look to the \u201ccontent, form, and context of a given statement, as revealed by the whole record.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The board in its opinion below conceded that the national air traffic controllers\u2019 strike was a matter of public concern, but found Brown\u2019s remarks only tangentially related to such concern. This view is not unreasonable: Brown\u2019s primary purpose in going to the union hall was to reassure his controllers that he had not been fired. However, the atmosphere at that hall at least in part changed the nature of his visit. In attendance there were not only union members and their families but journalists from the print and broadcast media as well. Brown\u2019s position as a nonunion supervisor, with 25 years\u2019 experience with the agency, added interest and credibility to his remarks. It is not surprising that a national television network found Brown\u2019s comments concerning \u201cstay together\u201d and \u201cyou\u2019ll win\u201d worthy of nationwide broadcast. Moreover, as noted above, Brown\u2019s remarks to other journalists, remarks not telecast, included his opinion that the strike was illegal, but that he nonetheless supported some of the strikers\u2019 demands. Bound as we are to consider the entire context and record of Brown\u2019s remarks, we find persuasive Brown\u2019s general contention that his comments extended well beyond the local union hall and his friends, the controllers, to rise to the level of speech on a matter of urgent public concern.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-13\">Having determined that Brown\u2019s remarks addressed a matter of public concern, we must decide if the interest of the agency as employer in promoting the efficiency of the public service it performs\u2014 control of the nation\u2019s air transportation system \u2014 outweighed Brown\u2019s interest in speaking on a public issue without fear of retaliatory dismissal. This involves a delicate balancing process:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b644-14\">* * * <em>Pickering </em>unmistakably states * * that the state\u2019s burden in justifying a particular discharge varies depending upon the nature of the employee\u2019s expression. Although such particularized balancing is difficult, the courts must reach the most appropriate possible bal-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>anee of the competing interests. [Footnotes omitted.]<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b645-4\">Weighing on the agency\u2019s side of this balance is the seriousness of the general situation: a nationwide strike, illegal and a criminal offense under federal law, aimed at one of the vital arteries of the nation\u2019s transportation system.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Certain telling particularized factors also weigh on the Government\u2019s side: the critical timing of Brown\u2019s remarks, some 36 hours after PATCO called the strike and during the 48-hour grace period in which President Reagan declared that striking controllers could return to work without losing their jobs; Brown\u2019s position as a supervisor and employee with long experience, to whom controllers in that highly charged moment could be expected to look for guidance; the fact that Brown\u2019s remarks, while not illegal themselves,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> encouraged the controllers to stay together and attempt to win an illegal strike. Moreover, Brown\u2019s position as a supervisor not only to whom nine controllers reported but who reported himself to higher-level agency management, weighs heavily on the agency\u2019s side. As was stated by a predecessor court in a first amendment context:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-5\">Management cannot function effectively unless it operates \u201cwith one voice\u201d <em>vis-a-vis others </em>[emphasis in original]. Cohesive operation of management is dependent on the loyalty of inferior management to superior management. This loyalty must be maintained in situations involving management\u2019s relations with nonmanagerial employees. For management to countenance disloyalty in such situations would be for management to render itself impotent.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b645-9\">Cooperation, loyalty, and trust are particularly important among those managing the operation of a complex, sophisticated transportation system where the lives of hundreds of innocent members of the public may, in extreme cases, depend upon split-second judgment. Such need for trust was even more acute at the moment Brown uttered his remarks, since the strike at TRACON was nearly wholly effective and management itself, working exhausting shifts, was largely operating the system.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-10\">Brown contends that the agency must \u201cclearly demonstrate\u201d that his speech \u201csubstantially and materially\u201d interfered with the agency\u2019s operations, and that the agency failed utterly to carry this burden. Brown cites the testimony of the supervisor who fired him as amounting to little more than \u201cundifferentiated speculation\u201d on the question of harm. Brown correctly points out the inability of the agency to produce testimony of other team leaders or controllers regarding, for example, specific controllers who were dissuaded from returning to work as a result of Brown\u2019s remarks. He also notes that his comments were made during his off-duty hours, that no agency instructions barred supervisors from speaking to the press or even associating with strikers, and that in any event his supervisory position was of such a low level, with so many layers of management above him, that he could not have breached any trust.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b645-11\">In our view Brown would place too great a burden on the agency to show <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>harm in his case. <em>Pickering </em>and <em>Connick </em>allow, indeed mandate, that the state\u2019s burden may vary depending upon the nature of the employee\u2019s expression. It is the duty of the court to perform a \u201cparticularized balancing\u201d between the competing interests.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The authorities upon which Brown has relied in support of his view of the Government\u2019s burden on harm are distinguishable on the facts from this particular, acute situation.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> While we have found that Brown\u2019s expression constituted a matter of public concern, we have also noted its context, especially its timing, and Brown\u2019s position itself as a supervisor. We have also discussed the factors weighing for and against the agency\u2019s showing of harm. Balancing all of these delicately as we must, we find that the interest of the agency did, in this national emergency context, outweigh Brown\u2019s interest in free speech, such that his remarks are not constitutionally protected.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-4\">2. <em>The Nexus Requirement</em></p>\n<p id=\"ABQ\">In imposing disciplinary action against Brown for his conduct, the agency was limited by law to taking action \u201conly for such cause as will promote the efficiency of the service.\u201d <footnotemark>15</footnotemark> This \u201cnexus\u201d limitation requires the agency to show by a preponderance of the evidence the necessary connection (i.e., promotion of the efficiency of the service) between the employee\u2019s offending conduct (off-duty in this case) and the employee\u2019s job-related responsibilities.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Since the nexus analysis is similar if not identical to the <em>Pickering </em>balance we have performed above between Brown\u2019s conduct as supervisor (off-duty remarks) and the agency\u2019s interest in pro-' moting the efficiency of the public service it performs, we do not repeat it here. We find, based on that analysis, that substantial evidence exists on the record for the board\u2019s finding that the agency proved the necessary nexus between Brown\u2019s conduct and his job responsibilities in a supervisory position. Brown\u2019s \u201ccommon sense should have forewarned him\u201d <footnotemark>17</footnotemark> that appearing before a union hall full of strikers, even though those strikers were his friends, could easily turn into a situation where his loyalty to management could be cast in doubt \u2014 as indeed it was.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-8\">3. <em>Appropriateness of Penalty</em></p>\n<p id=\"b646-9\">Having found sufficient evidence on the record to justify the required nexus, we examine the appropriateness of the penalty imposed \u2014 removal. In so doing we recognize the considerable discretion which the employing agency rightfully must exercise in this area.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> We also recognized and have weighed the numerous relevant factors to be considered in judging the appropriateness of the penalty.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Nevertheless, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>we believe that Brown\u2019s case is exceptional. His remarks on the illegality of the strike and his expressed wish that the strikers would \u201call come back\u201d are at least as strong evidence that his statements supported, rather than, as stated in the specification, that they \u201ccontradicted the public orders by the President for striking controllers to return to duty.\u201d Brown\u2019s 25 years\u2019 service, his nonparticipation in the strike, his demonstrated willingness to work 12-hour shifts at a time when the agency desperately needed him, plus the brevity and relative ambiguity of his remarks, combine to make a showing of the reasonableness of Brown\u2019s complete removal difficult if not impossible. Perhaps it is not far off the mark to characterize the agency\u2019s action, in Brown\u2019s isolated case, as one of overreaction. We therefore reverse the board\u2019s sustaining of the agency\u2019s complete removal penalty and remand for mitigation of that penalty. Having done so, we do not need to address the other procedural and due process issues Brown has here raised.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-5\">AFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED IN PART, AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"AXDv\">. As a result of a minor altercation between Brown and a policeman the morning of August 3, concerning Brown\u2019s car af the gate of TRA-CON, a number of Brown's controllers wondered if he had been suspended or removed, and were telephoning him to this effect.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"azn-dedup-0\">. That letter also charged as a basis for removal participation in an illegal strike in violation of 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7311 (1982).
