Because the district court acted well within its discretion in denying the motion, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-4\">In 1995, a jury convicted Charles Crehore of one count of conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute marijuana. <em>See 21 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841, 846. The district court sentenced Crehore to the mandatory statutory minimum, 240 months, <em>see 21 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A), after finding Crehore responsible for more than 1,000 kilograms of marijuana. In calculating the kilograms attributable to Crehore, the court included a large shipment that had been scheduled to be delivered after Crehore\u2019s arrest but that had been destroyed in a fire before the delivery.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">On direct appeal, our court affirmed Crehore\u2019s conviction and sentence. <em>See United States v. Gaitan-Acevedo, </em>148 F.3d 577, 594, 596 (6th Cir.1998). In affirming the district court\u2019s attribution of the large post-arrest shipment to Crehore, the court relied upon post-arrest communications between Crehore and one of his co-conspirators that the government in its appellate brief alleged had taken place but in fact never occurred. <em>See Crehore v. United States, </em>127 Fed.Appx. 792, 794-95 (6th Cir.2005). The government arguably tried to avoid this error when it sent a letter to the court after oral argument offering other factual bases for upholding the district court\u2019s finding. <em>See id. </em>\u201cNevertheless, we affirmed Crehore\u2019s sentence based on allegations in the government\u2019s brief, but not substantiated in the ... <em>letter____\u201d Id. </em>at 798-99. Crehore sought rehearing\u2014 claiming that the panel erroneously relied upon the \u201cfalse\u201d post-arrest allegations in the government\u2019s brief in reaching its conclusion \u2014 but our court denied relief. <em>Id. </em>at 799 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b574-8\">After the Supreme Court denied his petition for a writ of certiorari, <em>see Crehore v. United States, </em>525 U.S. 912, 119 S.Ct. 256, 142 L.Ed.2d 210 (1998), Crehore filed a \u00a7 2255 motion, alleging that his \u201ccounsel was ineffective at sentencing and on appeal for not adequately challenging the quantity of marijuana attributable to him,\u201d D. Ct. Op. at 1. The district court denied the motion, concluding that Crehore\u2019s \u201ccounsel vigorously challenged the quantity of marijuana attributable to [him] at every stage in the case, consistently maintaining that [he] was responsible for less than 1000 kilograms.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 20 (footnote omitted). In reaching that conclusion, the district court acknowledged the error in the government\u2019s brief on direct review and it noted that \u201cthe government did not rely [on that information] in arguing to the Court ... that [Crehore] is not entitled to relief under \u00a7 2255,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 19.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-10\">Our court affirmed, reasoning that counsel\u2019s \u201cperformance reveals no flaws of constitutional import.\u201d <em>See Crehore, </em>127 Fed.Appx. at 799. \u201c[Troubled that the government\u2019s erroneous characterization of Crehore\u2019s post-arrest contact with [one of his co-conspirators] was not explained to the panel that decided his direct appeal,\u201d the court noted that, if the government had perpetrated a fraud upon the direct-appeal panel, \u201ca conceivable remedy would be to petition the original panel to recall the mandate in the direct appeal.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 799 n. 4. \u201cIn any event,\u201d the court explained, \u201cwe cannot conclude that a complete miscarriage of justice has occurred in this matter as a result of our unfortunate reliance upon the government\u2019s [erroneous, allegations],\u201d because the \u201cevidence [discussed in the government\u2019s post-oral-argument letter] could support the trial court\u2019s conclusion that Crehore should also be held accountable for the drugs involved in the [post-arrest] load.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b574-11\">Taking this suggestion to heart, Crehore filed a motion with the panel that heard his direct appeal, asking it to recall the original mandate or to reinstate the appeal. The panel denied the motion, <em>see United </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number><em>States v. Crehore, </em>No. 95-1764 (6th Cir. Nov. 23, 2005), and subsequently denied Crehore\u2019s motion for reconsideration, <em>see United States v. Crehore, </em>No. 95-1764 (6th Cir. Jan. 6, 2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">Crehore filed a motion under Rule 60(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, asking the district court to vacate its order denying \u00a7 2255 relief \u201con the grounds that the government\u2019s error regarding the evidence linking [him] to the [post-arrest] load constitute^] a fraud upon the Court, and absent that error, [he] would have been entitled to relief under \u00a7 2255.\u201d <em>Crehore v. United States, </em>No. 99-CV-74332, 2006 WL 2255357, at *4 (E.D.Mich. Aug.7, 2006). The district court denied the motion, reasoning that it \u201cwas well aware of the erroneous statement in the government\u2019s brief on appeal at the time it denied [Crehore\u2019s] \u00a7 2255 motion\u201d and that, \u201cmost significantly, the original panel recently declined to recall the mandate or reinstate the direct appeal based on the same argument [Crehore] makes here. In doing so, the original panel found no fraud warranting relief based on the government\u2019s statement.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b575-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-7\">To the extent Crehore\u2019s claim arises under Rule 60(b)(3), he was required to show by clear and convincing evidence that the district court\u2019s judgment was obtained by fraud or misconduct. <em>See Jordan v. Paccar, Inc., </em>No. 95-3478, 1996 WL 528950, at *9 (6th Cir Sept.17, 1996) (per curiam). To the extent Crehore means to raise an independent action for fraud upon the court, he was required to prove five elements: (1) conduct by an officer of the court (2) that is directed towards the judicial machinery itself, (3) that is intentionally false, wilfully blind to the truth or is in reckless disregard for the truth, (4) that is a positive averment or concealment when one is under a duty to disclose and (5) that deceives the court. <em>Workman v. Bell, </em>484 F.3d 837, 840 n. 1 (6th Cir.2007). We review a district court\u2019s denial of either type of motion for abuse of discretion. <em>Cacevic v. City of Hazel Park, </em>226 F.3d 483, 490 (6th Cir.2000); <em>Barrett v. Sec\u2019y of Health &amp; Human Servs., </em>840 F.2d 1259, 1263 (6th Cir.1987) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b575-9\">Whether we analyze Crehore\u2019s claim under the Rule 60(b)(3) or the fraud-upon-the-court standard \u2014 which \u201cin most respects [is] more difficult to meet than that under Rule 60(b)(3),\u201d <em>see Spirko v. Bradshaw, </em>161 Fed.Appx. 492, 494 (6th Cir.2005) \u2014 the claim fails because Crehore did not present any evidence that the government defrauded, or attempted to defraud, the district court that denied his \u00a7 2255 motion. The opinion of the district court, indeed, directly refutes the necessary premise of his claim: \u201c[T]he government did not rely on [the false statements] in arguing to the Court that the [post-arrest] load was properly attributed to [Crehore] and that [Crehore] is not entitled to relief under \u00a7 2255. The government instead points to the same four pieces of evidence [discussed in its post-oral-argument letter to the direct-appeal panel].\u201d D. Ct. Op. at 19. The \u00a7 2255 court, it concludes, \u201cwas well aware of the erroneous statement in the government\u2019s brief on appeal at the time it denied [Crehore\u2019s] \u00a7 2255 motion.\u201d <em>Crehore, </em>2006 WL 2255357, at *4. Our court said nearly as much when it affirmed the district court\u2019s denial of Crehore\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion and suggested that Crehore\u2019s only \u201cconceivable remedy would be to petition the original panel to recall the mandate in the direct appeal.\u201d <em>Crehore, </em>127 Fed.Appx. at 799 n. 4. Crehore did that, and the original panel denied his petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-10\">Crehore resists this conclusion on the ground that the government attached the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>brief it filed in the direct appeal together with the panel opinion from the direct appeal to its \u00a7 2255 pleadings \u2014 thereby defrauding <em>that </em>court. But we cannot fault the government for providing information in that proceeding that was relevant to Crehore\u2019s ineffective-assistance claim. Nor, given the relevance of this material to the \u00a7 2255 proceeding, can Crehore offer any tenable reason for concluding that the government\u2019s inclusion of this material in that record rose to the level of \u201ca deliberately planned and carefully executed scheme designed to subvert the integrity of the judicial process,\u201d <em>Buell v. Anderson, </em>48 Fed.Appx. 491, 499 (6th Cir.2002) (internal quotation marks omitted), particularly when, in the words of the court that denied Crehore\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion, \u201cthe government did not rely\u201d on the erroneous statements in responding to Crehore\u2019s \u00a7 2255 claims, D. Ct. Op. at 19.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-4\">The final straw in all of this is the reasoning of the panel that heard Crehore\u2019s direct appeal and that was asked to recall the mandate based on the government\u2019s misstatement. When it concluded that the government\u2019s misstatement in its appellate brief did not warrant relief, <em>see Crehore, </em>No. 95-1764 (6th Cir. Nov. 23, 2005) (\u201c[W]e cannot conclude that the court was deceived by the government\u2019s misstatements or the judicial process has been subverted.\u201d), it removed any conceivable basis for us to conclude that the same misstatement \u2014 when attached to \u00a7 2255 pleadings and upon which the \u00a7 2255 court <em>did not rely </em>\u2014 somehow warrants relief. <em>See Spirko, </em>161 Fed.Appx. at 493 (rejecting a habeas petitioner\u2019s fraud claim under Rule 60(b)(3) because, even assuming that the prosecutor misrepresented information, \u201cthe information at issue did not bear upon the outcome of the federal habeas proceedings\u201d); <em>Jordan, </em>1996 WL 528950, at *9 (holding that denying a Rule 60(b)(3) motion is proper where there is \u201cclear and convincing evidence that the misbehavior ... had no prejudicial effect on the outcome of the litigation\u201d) (emphasis omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b576-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-7\">For these reasons, we affirm.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
