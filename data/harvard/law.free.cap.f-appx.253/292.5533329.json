On appeal Stokely argues that his sentence, in excess of his advisory sentencing range, was erroneous. For the reasons that follow, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-21\">We do not find that Stokel/s sentence was plainly unreasonable. <em>United States v. Crudup, </em>461 F.3d 433, 437 (4th Cir.2006) (providing review standard), <em>cert. denied, \u2014U</em>.S.-, 127 S.Ct. 1813, 167 L.Ed.2d 325 (2007). Although the district court failed to specifically mention by name the 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(a) (West 2000 <em>&amp; </em>Supp.2007) factors applicable to supervised release, <em>see </em>18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3583(e) (West 2000 &amp; Supp.2007), the court gave reasons for the sentence which mirrored certain \u00a7 3553(a) factors, and sufficiently explained why Stokely was given a sentence outside his advisory sentencing range. <em>See Rita v. United States, </em>\u2014 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>U.S.-, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2469, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007) (noting that \u201c[wjhere a [sentencing] matter is ... conceptually simple\u201d and the record makes clear that the sentencing judge considered the evidence and arguments, \u201cwe do not believe the law requires the judge to write more extensively\u201d); <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>445 F.3d 339, 345 (4th Cir.2006) (stating sentencing courts need not \u201crobotically tick through \u00a7 3553(a)\u2019s every subsection\u201d or \u201cexplicitly discuss every \u00a7 3553(a) factor on the record\u201d) (internal quotation and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b319-6\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-7\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
