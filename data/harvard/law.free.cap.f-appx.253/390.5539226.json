In his brief, Alves challenges the BIA\u2019s denial of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>his motions to reopen and reconsider. Alves argues that the BIA erred in finding that the doctrines of res judicata and collateral estoppel did not bar the Government from using his prior 1996 and 1997 convictions to invoke the stop time rule. He also contends that his prior state convictions have been vacated and are therefore invalid for immigration purposes. Because these convictions are invalid, Alves argues that he is eligible for cancellation of removal. The Government argues that this court lacks jurisdiction over Alves\u2019s petition for review because the underlying order was the denial of a discretionary cancellation of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">Because Alves\u2019s petition for review was not filed within 30 days of the dismissal of his appeal by the BIA, this court lacks jurisdiction to review his argument challenging the BIA\u2019s finding regarding the doctrine of res judicata, and his petition for review must be dismissed in part. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(1); <em>Navarro-Miranda v. Ashcroft, </em>330 F.3d 672, 676 (5th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b417-6\">Although this court lacks jurisdiction to review challenges to discretionary denials of relief under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b, there is a \u201cdistinction between eligibility for discretionary relief, on the one hand, and the favorable exercise of discretion, on the other hand.\u201d <em>Bravo v. Ashcroft, </em>341 F.3d 590, 592 (5th Cir.2003) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted); 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)\u00a9. Because Alves challenges his eligibility for relief, the jurisdictional bar does not apply. Additionally, this court has jurisdiction to review the denials of motions to reopen and reconsider. <em>Zhao v. Gonzales, </em>404 F.3d 295, 303 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b417-7\">This court reviews the denial of a motion to reopen and a motion to reconsider for abuse of discretion. <em>Zhao, </em>404 F.3d at 303. Alves\u2019s motion to reopen was denied based on the numerical bar. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2). Alves does not brief the BIA\u2019s denial of his motion to reopen on this basis. Thus, the issue of the denial of the motion to reopen is abandoned. <em>See Soadjede v. Ashcroft, </em>324 F.3d 830, 833 (5th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b417-11\">Alves\u2019s remaining arguments challenging the validity of his vacated convictions and his eligibility for cancellation of removal are without merit. In <em>RenteriaGonzalez v. INS, </em>322 F.3d 804, 814 (5th Cir.2002), this court held that \u201ca vacated conviction, federal or state, remains valid for purposes of the immigration laws.\u201d Thus, Alves does not show that the BIA abused its discretion in denying his motion to reconsider. <em>See Zhao, </em>404 F.3d at 303.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-12\">DISMISSED IN PART; DENIED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b416-22\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
