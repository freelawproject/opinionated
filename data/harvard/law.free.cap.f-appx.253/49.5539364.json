Mar. 29, 2005). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-16\">We review the denial of a motion to reopen for abuse of discretion. <em>See Kaur v. BIA, </em>413 F.3d 232, 233 (2d Cir.2005) (per curiam). An abuse of discretion may be found where the decision \u201cprovides no rational explanation, inexplicably departs from established policies, is devoid of any reasoning, or contains only summary or conclusory statements; that is to say, where the Board has acted in an arbitrary or capricious manner.\u201d <em>Ke Zhen Zhao v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>265 F.3d 83, 93 (2d Cir.2001) (internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b75-17\">As a preliminary matter, to the extent that Singh attempts to reargue the merits of the underlying denial of his asylum application, that decision is not properly before this Court. Only the BIA\u2019s March 2005 decision is before us as that is the only decision from which a petition for review was timely filed. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b75-18\">The BIA properly denied Singh\u2019s third motion to reopen as numerically barred. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2) (an alien may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>file only one motion to reopen). Moreover, the BIA did not abuse its discretion in finding that Singh failed to present material evidence of changed country conditions in order to satisfy the exception to this numerical bar. <em>Cfi </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(e)(3)(ii); <em>Poradisova v. Gonzales, </em>420 F.3d 70, 78 (2d Cir.2005). Singh submitted no evidence other than the bare assertions in his motion that country conditions had materially changed in India.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-4\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. Having completed our review, the pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
