We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts, the procedural history, and the issues on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-11\">On appeal of a denial of a \u00a7 2255 motion, \u201cwe review a district court\u2019s conclusions of law <em>de novo </em>but will accept its factual findings unless they are clearly erroneous.\u201d <em>Sapia v. United States, </em>433 F.3d 212, 216 (2d Cir.2005). The Supreme Court\u2019s two-pronged test in <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984), provides that in order to prove a Sixth Amendment violation for ineffective assistance of counsel, petitioner must show both (i) \u201cthat counsel\u2019s representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness ... under prevailing professional norms,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 688, 104 S.Ct. 2052; and (ii) \u201cthat the deficient performance prejudiced the defense,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052. <em>Aparicio v. Artuz, </em>269 F.3d 78, 95 (2d Cir.2001) (applying the same test to claims of ineffective assistance of counsel on appeal).</p>\n<p id=\"b160-13\">Petitioner-appellant argues that his Sixth Amendment right was violated when his counsel, on direct appeal, failed to challenge his sentence based on <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). We note that, at the time of his direct appeal, petitioner\u2019s <em>Apprendi </em>argument was foreclosed by our decision in <em>United States v. Luciano, </em>311 F.3d 146, 151 (2d Cir.2002) (concluding that where \u201cthe defendant\u2019s sentence is within the otherwise applicable maximum, no violation of <em>Apprendi </em>has occurred\u201d). It was more than two years after appellate counsel filed the direct appeal that our court decided <em>United States v. Gonzalez, </em>420 F.3d 111, 115-16 (2d Cir.2005) (holding that drug quantity is an element of an offense for the purposes of determining a mandatory minimum and, accordingly, must be found by a jury). We have repeatedly held, when assessing the \u201cobjective standard of reasonableness\u201d component of <em>Strickland, </em>that counsel is \u201cnot required to \u2018forecast changes or advances in the law.\u2019 \u201d <em>Sellan v. Kuhlman, </em>261 F.3d 303, 315 (2d Cir.2001) (quoting <em>Jameson v. Coughlin, </em>22 F.3d 427, 429 (2d Cir.1994)); <em>see also Mayo v. Henderson, </em>13 F.3d 528, 533 (2d Cir.1994). Therefore, we cannot say that appellate counsel\u2019s failure to raise an <em>Apprendi </em>challenge was objectively unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-14\">The judgment of the District Court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
