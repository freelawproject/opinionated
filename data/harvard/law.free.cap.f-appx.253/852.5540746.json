Del Cid contends his sentence is both procedurally and substantively unreasonable. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"853\">*853</page-number>He contends the sentence is procedurally unreasonable because the district court single-mindedly focused on the goal of deterrence to the detriment of all of the other 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors. Del Cid asserts the sentence is substantively unreasonable because it is four times the high end of his Guidelines range of zero to six months, at the statutory maximum, and far greater than necessary to accomplish the goals of sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-5\">After the district court has correctly calculated the Guidelines range, we review the final sentence for reasonableness. <em>United States v. Williams, </em>435 F.3d 1350, 1353 (11th Cir.2006). \u201cAfter <em>[United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005) ], a sentence may be reviewed for procedural or substantive unreasonableness. A sentence may be unreasonable if it is the product of a procedure that does not follow Bookeds requirements, regardless of the actual sentence. Additionally, a sentence may be substantively unreasonable, regardless of the procedure used.\u201d <em>United States v. Hunt, </em>459 F.3d 1180, 1182 n. 3 (11th Cir.2006). A defendant challenging his sentence bears the burden of establishing that it is unreasonable. <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b879-6\">\u201cWhen reviewing a sentence for reasonableness, we must evaluate whether the sentence achieves the purposes of sentencing as stated in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).\u201d <em>United States v. Williams, </em>456 F.3d 1353, 1360 (11th Cir.2006), <em>cert. dismissed, </em>\u2014U.S.-, 127 S.Ct. 3040, 168 L.Ed.2d 755 (2007). The factors presented in \u00a7 3553(a) include</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b879-9\">(1) the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant; (2) the need to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, and to provide just punishment for the offense; (3) the need for deterrence; (4) the need to protect the public; (5) the need to provide the defendant with needed educational or vocational training or medical care; (6) the kinds of sentences available; (7) the Sentencing Guidelines range; (8) pertinent policy statements of the Sentencing Commission; (9) the need to avoid unwanted sentencing disparities; and (10) the need to provide restitution to victims.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b879-11\"><em>Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 786 (citing 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)). The weight to be accorded any given statutory factor is a matter committed to the sound discretion of the district court. <em>United States v. Williams, </em>456 F.3d 1353, 1363 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b879-12\">In <em>United States v. Crisp, </em>454 F.3d 1285, 1290-92 (11th Cir.2006), we found a five-hour term of imprisonment was unreasonable. Although the district court stated \u201cthe sentence reflects the seriousness of the offense, provides just punishment, affords adequate deterrence and adequately protects the public,\u201d we noted the district court\u2019s primary concern at sentencing was restitution, and the brief sentence was imposed so the defendant could earn money to make restitution payments. <em>Id. </em>at 1290. We noted \u201ca district court\u2019s \u2018unjustified reliance upon any one [\u00a7 3553(a) ] factor is a symptom of an unreasonable sentence,\u2019 \u201d and concluded that \u201c[t]he district court focused single-mindedly on the goal of restitution to the detriment of all of the other sentencing factors. An unreasonable approach produced an unreasonable sentence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1292.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-13\">Del Cid\u2019s sentence was not procedurally unreasonable because the district court did not focus single-mindedly on one of the sentencing factors to the detriment of all of the others. The district court not only mentioned, but discussed, the Guidelines range, the nature and circumstances of the offense, the history and characteris<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"854\">*854</page-number>tics of the defendant, the seriousness of the offense, the need to promote respect for the law, specific and general deterrence, and the need to protect the public. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). Additionally, the district court\u2019s sentence did not operate to the detriment of the sentencing factors. The sentence in <em>Cnsp </em>did not serve the non-restitution sentencing factors because, by eliminating any real incarceration in favor of maximizing the defendant\u2019s ability to pay restitution, it did \u201cnot reflect the seriousness of the crime, promote respect for the law, and provide just punishment for the offense, as \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A) requires, nor [did] it afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct, as \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(B) requires.\u201d <em>Id. </em>By contrast, Del Cid\u2019s sentence actually promoted these sentencing factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-4\">Further, Del Cid\u2019s sentence was not substantively unreasonable. The district court considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, and found the Guidelines range did not produce a sentence sufficient to achieve the statutory purposes of sentencing. While Del Cid\u2019s sentence was four times the high end of the Guidelines range, any upward variance from an extremely short Guidelines range will necessarily be a proportionally large increase. In light of these considerations, the district court\u2019s determination that a two-year sentence was required was not unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
