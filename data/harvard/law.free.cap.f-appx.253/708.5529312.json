Substantial evidence supports the Board\u2019s conclusion. <em>See Wang v. Ashcroft, </em>341 F.3d 1015, 1019-1020 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b735-22\">To establish eligibility for asylum on the basis of past persecution, petitioners must show: \u201c(1) an incident, or incidents, that rise to the level of persecution; (2) that is \u2018on account of one of the statutorily-protected grounds; and (3) is committed by the government or forces the government is either \u2018unable or unwilling\u2019 to control.\u201d <em>Navas v. INS, </em>217 F.3d 646, 655-56 (9th Cir.2000). Petitioners failed to show that any claimed past persecution was committed by the Mexican government or forces that the government was unable or unwilling to control. The woman who allegedly beat Arcinda HernandezVenegas was not affiliated with the government; furthermore, Arcinda Hernandez-Venegas testified that the woman was incarcerated for over a month and forced to pay part of Arcinda Hernandez-Venegas\u2019 medical costs, evidencing the government\u2019s willingness and ability to control her.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>Petitioners are not eligible for relief under the CAT as there was no showing that the mistreatment was \u201cby or at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a public official.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.18(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b736-4\">Petitioners did not challenge on appeal the Board\u2019s determination that Reina Hernandez-Venegas was not born in the United States. The argument is therefore waived.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-5\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b735-16\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
