Jackson also argues that the District Court penalized him for exercising his right to a <em>post-Booker </em>re-sentencing and that the sentence imposed created improper disparities between himself and similarly-situated defendants. Because there is ample record evidence that the District Court considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and imposed a sentence that reflects a reasonable application of those factors, and because that sentence neither penalized Jackson for his re-sentencing nor created improper disparities between similarly-situated defendants, we will affirm the District Court\u2019s decision in all respects.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-16\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-17\">As we write only for the parties, our summary of the facts is brief. In 1997 Courtney Carter founded what became a sprawling, massive drug dealing organization (the Carter Organization). By February 2002, the Carter Organization was operating across Pennsylvania and Delaware. In total, the Carter Organization sold over a metric ton of cocaine and crack, and engaged in numerous shootings, one of which resulted in murder. Braheem Jackson was released from state prison in Pennsylvania in September 2001, and immediately set to work as a crack dealer for the Carter Organization. He operated at the corner of Brooklyn and Wallace Streets in West Philadelphia.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-18\">On December 8, 2001, Jackson was sleeping in bed at 636 Brooklyn Street when the police raided the property. After the police found 145 grams of crack, 20.7 grams of cocaine, $4,700.00 in cash, various drug paraphernalia, and five loaded handguns on the premises \u2014 one in the bed in which Jackson slept \u2014 they arrested Jackson, along with two other Carter Organization members. Jackson was arrested again on December 18, 2001 (in posses<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>sion of 3.27 grams of crack), and a third time on February 19, 2002 (in possession of 3.38 grams of crack).</p>\n<p id=\"b240-4\">On October 24, 2002, a federal grand jury indicted Jackson and thirty-six others on a total of 135 counts related to the Carter Organization\u2019s activities. The indictment included a wide variety of drug, gun, money laundering, and conspiracy charges. Jackson faced four charges, for conspiracy to distribute cocaine and crack, possession with intent to distribute crack, possession with intent to distribute crack within 1,000 feet of a school, and use of a firearm in furtherance of a drug offense. Jackson went to trial in February and March of 2004, and was convicted of all charges but the conspiracy count, which the government subsequently dismissed without prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">Following Jackson\u2019s conviction, a probation officer prepared a Presentence Report (PSR). This report discussed, <em>inter alia, </em>the circumstances surrounding the crimes of which Jackson was convicted, as well as Jackson\u2019s criminal history and other personal information. The PSR also concluded that Jackson had an offense level of 40 and a criminal history category of IV, which corresponded to an imprisonment range of 360 months to life for the drug convictions under the then-mandatory Sentencing Guidelines. Moreover, the conviction for the gun charge subjected Jackson to 60 months of mandatory consecutive imprisonment, resulting in a total minimum Guidelines imprisonment range of 420 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-6\">Jackson was first sentenced on May 7, 2004. The District Court sustained Jackson\u2019s objection to the PSR\u2019s drug weight calculation, which had the effect of lowering his base offense level to 36 and his total offense level to 38. After recalculating Jackson\u2019s Guideline range to 324-405 months for the drug convictions, the District Court sentenced Jackson to the bottom of this range for the drug convictions and added the mandatory 60-month consecutive sentence for the gun conviction, thereby reaching a total sentence of 384 months incarceration.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-8\">On May 20, 2004, Jackson appealed his sentence. On August 17, 2006, this Court affirmed the conviction, but remanded the case for re-sentencing in accordance with the mandates of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). <em>See United States v. Jackson, </em>192 Fed.Appx. 96, 97 (3d Cir.2006) (unpublished opinion).</p>\n<p id=\"b240-9\">On October 17, 2006, Jackson was re-sentenced, and received the same sentence \u2014 384 months imprisonment \u2014 as at his 2004 sentencing. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-10\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-11\">We review a sentence imposed by a District Court for reasonableness. <em>United States v. Cooper, </em>437 F.3d 324, 326 (3d Cir.2006). This inquiry has two steps, because in the sentencing context, reasonableness has both procedural and substantive components. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Ferguson, </em>456 F.3d 660, 664 (6th Cir.2006). First, we must review the record to determine if the District Court exercised its discretion by considering the relevant factors enumerated in \u00a7 3553(a). <em>Id. </em>at 329. A sentence is procedurally unreasonable if the District Court fails to consider the applicable Guideline range or neglects to consider the other factors listed in \u00a7 3553(a). <em>Cooper, </em>437 F.3d at 329. Imposition of a within-Guidelines sentence\u2014 without more \u2014 demonstrates only that the District Court \u201cconsidered one of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors \u2014 namely, the guideline range itself, [but] does not show that the court considered the other standards re-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>fleeted in that section....\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 330 (internal citations omitted); see also 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(4) (listing Sentencing Guidelines as one of seven factors the District Court must consider in imposing sentence).</p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">While \u201cthere are no magic words that a district judge must invoke when sentencing, ... the record should demonstrate that the court considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors [in fashioning the defendant\u2019s sentence].\u201d <em>Cooper, </em>437 F.3d at 332. Thus, we must determine whether the District Court gave \u201cmeaningful consideration\u201d to the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>Id. </em>If the record does not reflect adequate consideration of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, remand is required, and our inquiry ends there. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b241-6\">If, however, the record makes clear that the District Court gave meaningful consideration to the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, our analysis must proceed to the substantive aspect of reasonableness: an evaluation of whether the sentence reflects a rational application of those factors. <em>Cooper, </em>437 F.3d at 329.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-8\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-9\">Although there is no bright-line test to determine what depth of analysis qualifies as \u201cmeaningful consideration,\u201d we have recently articulated certain principles that guide our review in this respect. On the one hand, the District Court \u201cneed not discuss every argument made by a litigant if an argument is clearly without merit. Nor must a court discuss and make findings as to each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors if the record makes clear the court took the factors into account in sentencing.\u201d <em>Cooper, </em>437 F.3d at 329 (internal citations omitted). On the other hand, a \u201crote statement\u201d that the Court has considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors is insufficient. <em>Id. </em>This is so because \u201cthere is no way to review a court\u2019s exercise of discretion if it does not articulate the reasons underlying its decision.\u201d <em>Id. (quoting United States v. Johnson, </em>388 F.3d 96, 101 (3d Cir.2004) (internal quotations omitted)). The District Court need not recapitulate its consideration of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors during the plea colloquy, however, if the basis for the sentence imposed is \u201cotherwise apparent from the record.\u201d <em>Cooper, </em>437 F.3d at 329 <em>(quoting Becker v. ARCO Chem. Co., </em>207 F.3d 176, 180-81 (3d Cir.2000)). In view of these principles, the question is whether \u201cthe record as a whole reflects rational and meaningful consideration of the factors enumerated in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).\u201d <em>United States v. Schweitzer, </em>454 F.3d 197, 204 (3d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b241-11\">In this ease, there is ample evidence that the District Court considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors in imposing sentence. First, the District Court certainly considered \u00a7 3553(a)(4), because it recited the Guidelines Range and then sentenced Jackson to a sentence within that range. Next, the District Court adopted the findings and conclusions stated in the Presentence Report. In addition to a lengthy description of the Carter Organization\u2019s massive and brazen criminality, the PSR contained a detailed description of Jackson\u2019s specific participation in the Carter Organization. Moreover, the PSR set forth substantial amounts of information about Jackson\u2019s history and characteristics, including his personal and family history, employment history, mental and emotional health, educational background, and criminal history.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-12\">The District Court considered, at remarkable length, these factors and others at the re-sentencing hearing. The transcript of the re-sentencing hearing, stretching over fifty pages, reflects a careful and thorough consideration of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>\u00a7 3553(a) in all its aspects. The District Court did not merely \u201cdiscuss\u201d each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, it ruminated over them, struggling with the implications of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors on Jackson\u2019s sentence. <em>See, e.g., </em>Appendix (App.) J. 43 (calling the sentencing decision \u201cthe most difficult calculus a judge ever has to make. No question about it.\u201d); <em>see also, e.g., </em>App. J. 30 (noting that Jackson\u2019s sentencing raised \u201cthe issue of individual justice versus protecting society, that\u2019s why I say this is so darn profound.\u201d). Nonetheless, Jackson raises several challenges to the District Court\u2019s consideration of \u00a7 3553(a), which we will consider in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-4\">1.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">Jackson first argues that the District Court erred by not considering \u00a7 3553(a)(6), which mandates that \u201c[t]he court, in determining the particular sentence to be imposed, shall consider ... (6) the need to avoid unwarranted sentence disparities\u201d among similarly-situated defendants. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(6). Because a co-defendant, Rollerson, whose offense conduct was very similar to Jackson\u2019s, received a 300 month sentence, Jackson argues that his own 384 month sentence was unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-6\">Jackson is incorrect. First, as the District Court acknowledged in depth at the resentencing hearing, Rollerson was sentenced during the \u201cinterregnum\u201d in federal sentencing between <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004) and <em>Booker. </em>Faced with an uncertain sentencing landscape (the District Court called it a \u201cfog bank\u201d), the District Court followed the premise that only facts found by a jury or admitted by the defendant could be used in determining the Guidelines range. This analysis was ultimately rejected by <em>Booker, </em>which retained judicial fact-finding at sentencing but rendered the Guidelines advisory. Nonetheless, Rollerson benefitted from the District Court\u2019s interpretation of <em>Blakely, </em>and he wisely chose not to be resentenced under <em>Booker. </em>Jackson, however, was resentenced not under <em>Blakely </em>(and the District Court\u2019s ultimately erroneous assumption regarding <em>Blakely\u2019s, </em>implications), but under <em>Booker.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b242-8\">Because Rollerson\u2019s and Jackson\u2019s sentences were imposed under different sentencing regimes, the disparity between the two sentences is not an \u201cunwarranted disparity\u201d prohibited by \u00a7 3553(a)(6). Rather, it is very much a <em>warranted </em>disparity. That Rollerson benefitted from a fluke in the timing of his sentence does not mean that, under a new and different precedent, Jackson can benefit from the same fluke. As the District Court stated, simply because \u201cMr. Rollerson was enormously fortunate ... that does not mean that the Court is [ ] going to be or needs to be sucked into a sort of downward spiral of comparing every sentence to the very favorable treatment that a certain defendant or defendants received in the interregnum between <em>Blakely </em>and <em>Booker.\u201d </em>App. J. 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-9\">Second, the only way this Court could eliminate the warranted disparity between Jackson\u2019s sentence and Rollerson\u2019s would be to <em>create </em>unwarranted disparities between Jackson\u2019s sentence and two other defendants in the Carter Organization cases, Renard Brown and Nathaniel Montgomery. Brown\u2019s offense level was 40 and his criminal history category was I, and he did not have a gun conviction pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c) (which, as noted above, carries a mandatory consecutive 60 month sentence). He received a sentence of 300 months. Montgomery had an offense level of 38, a criminal history category of I, and no \u00a7 924(c) conviction. He received a sentence of 282 months. Jackson, with an offense level of 38, a criminal history cate<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>gory of IV, and an automatic 60 additional months for his \u00a7 924(c) conviction, received 384 months. Thus, without the \u00a7 924(c) conviction, Jackson\u2019s sentence presumably would have been 324 months. Given his significantly higher criminal history category, Jackson\u2019s sentence is manifestly in line with the sentences of both Brown and Montgomery. But Jackson would have his sentence be reduced to 300 months total \u2014 translating to a drug-dealing sentence of 240 months. That sentence would create an unwarranted disparity between his sentence and those of Brown and Montgomery \u2014 unwarranted, of course, because all three men have been sentenced under the same <em>post-Booker </em>sentencing regime. Such a result would not be reasonable, and we decline to endorse it.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">2.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-6\">Jackson next argues that the District Court did not consider Jackson\u2019s nonfrivolous argument regarding the crack/powder cocaine differential. In <em>United States v. Gunter, </em>462 F.3d 237, 249 (3d Cir.2006), this Court reminded district courts that they have the discretion to consider the crack/powder cocaine differential as a factor when imposing a sentence after considering \u00a7 3553(a). Jackson claims that he raised <em>Gunter </em>at his re-sentencing, but that the District Court \u201cfailed to respond in any meaningful way\u201d to Jackson\u2019s argument. Jackson therefore claims that his sentence cannot be upheld as reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-7\">We note first that this argument is ironic based upon the statements of Jackson\u2019s counsel at the re-sentencing hearing. <em>See </em>App. J. 24 (\u201cit has been my experience in this Court that your Honor always takes the arguments made by counsel seriously\u201d); App. J. 35 (\u201chaving appeared before you a number of times, I know that you give these issues a lot of thought____And, that your Honor is very serious about your role in sentencing defendants. I know that.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b243-9\">Second, however, Jackson\u2019s argument is belied by the record. Jackson\u2019s counsel only briefly touched on the <em>Gunter </em>argument himself at the re-sentencing hearing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A8\">Mr. Maneano: The final point, I really don\u2019t want to belabor that. Mr. Lloret spends a lot of time in his sentencing memo arguing that, but I don\u2019t think we disagree as to what Gunter says. We are not asking the Court to substitute its own ratio.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-10\">The Court: No, no, no. I read <em>Pho.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-11\">Mr. Maneano: All we are saying, among the factors, consider that differential in fashioning a sentence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-12\">The Court: All right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-13\">Mr. Maneano: That\u2019s all we are saying there, your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-14\">The Court: All right.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b243-15\">App. J. 38.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-16\">The Court indicated that it had read <em>United States v. Pho, </em>433 F.3d 53, 62 (1st Cir.2006), which relates to the same subject matter as <em>Gunter. </em>This makes plain that the Court was well aware of <em>Gunter's </em>import. In addition, the District Court indicated that it paid close attention to Jackson\u2019s brief, which set forth the <em>Gunter </em>argument in detail. The Court acknowledged Jackson\u2019s argument, and indicated that it understood the argument. Simply because the Court did not accept Jackson\u2019s position does not make the District Court\u2019s decision unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-17\">3.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-18\">Jackson\u2019s third argument is based upon the so-called \u201cparsimony provision,\u201d which states that \u201c[t]he court shall impose a sentence sufficient, but not greater than necessary,\u201d to comply with the goals of sentencing set forth in \u00a7 3553(a)(2). At <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>Jackson\u2019s original sentencing, the District Court commented that a 384 month sentence \u201csurely suffices to satisfy all the goals\u201d of \u00a7 3553(a)(2). It then reimposed the same sentence at Jackson\u2019s re-sentencing. According to Jackson, this means that the District Court \u201cexplicitly ignored\u201d the \u201cparsimony provision\u201d and therefore applied \u201cthe wrong legal standard ... in imposing [Jackson\u2019s] sentence,\u201d Jackson Br. at 14, resulting in \u201ca sentence which is much greater than necessary to accomplish the goals of Section 3553(a).\u201d Jackson Br. at 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-4\">Jackson is mistaken. Not only did the District Court specifically refer to the \u201cparsimony provision\u201d during a colloquy with Jackson\u2019s counsel, but it engaged in a lengthy discussion with Jackson\u2019s counsel regarding just that topic. The Court pressed counsel on how he could assure the Court that a 300 month (as opposed to a 384 month) sentence would be sufficient to, among other considerations, \u201cprotect the public from further crimes of the defendant.\u201d App. J. 30. This is the precise language of \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(C). The Court also discussed the need for the sentence to \u201cafford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct,\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(B), by noting that \u201cthere is a statistical difference, the older you get, the less likely you are to commit crimes.\u201d App. J. 32-33. It is thus clear that the District Court not only took the parsimony provision into account in determining Jackson\u2019s sentence, but delved thoroughly into the purposes of sentencing to which each particular sentence must comply. Accordingly, because the re-sentencing transcript demonstrates cleai\u2019ly that the Court considex\u2019ed the parsimony provision at length, we x\u2019eject Jackson\u2019s argument on this point.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">4.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">Finally, Jackson argues that the District Court erred by failing to consider propexdy \u00a7 3553(a)(1), which dictates that in fashioning a sentence, the District Coux\u2019t \u201cshall consider ... (1) ... the history and characteristics of the defendant.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1). According to Jackson, the Court was unable to find a way to measure precisely Jackson\u2019s tragic personal history vis a vis the Guidelines sentencing factors, and therefore \u201cmistakenly believed that ... the information could not be used at all.\u201d Jackson Br. at 23.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-8\">This assertion is belied by the record. The Coux\u2019t considered, and sympathized with, Jackson\u2019s heartbreaking personal history \u2014 at one point acknowledging that Mr. Jackson had endured \u201ca Dickensian background.... I mean one thinks about Oliver Twist.\u201d App. J. 28, 40-41. Indeed, the Court recognized that the question of how a defendant\u2019s background plays into sentencing \u201cis a very profound issue that you have raised.\u201d App. J. 26. But it also rejected a deterministic formula that a difficult background necessarily leads to a life of exime. The Court noted that many people who \u201ccome out of horxific circumstances [ ] don\u2019t end up [committing eximes]. Isn\u2019t it unfair to them to say, well, it was just inevitable\u201d for Jackson to end up a felon, because \u201cit does violence to the law abiding people\u201d who come from the hard corners of the woxid. App. J. 26.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-9\">Moreover, \u00a7 3553(a)(1) mandates consideration not only of the \u201chistory\u201d of the defendant, but also of the \u201ccharactexistics of the defendant.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1). In considerhxg this factor at length, the Court engaged in a discussion with Jackson\u2019s counsel regarding how, in part due to Jackson\u2019s terxibly fractured home life, the only job he had ever held\u2014 ever \u2014 was selling drugs. Therefox\u2019e, the Distxict Court concluded, reluctantly, that \u201cthe only thing that society can do is to incapacitate [Jackson] precisely because he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>has no other means of making a living. You see it is the issue of individual justice versus protecting society, that\u2019s why I say this is so darn profound.\u201d App. J. 30. In conclusion, the district court considered, at length, both aspects of \u00a7 3553(a)(1) \u2014 Jackson\u2019s history and Jackson\u2019s characteristics. The District Court\u2019s \u201cfailure to give mitigating factors the weight a defendant contends they deserve\u201d does not render the sentence unreasonable. <em>United States v. Bungar, </em>478 F.3d 540, 546 (3d Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-6\">The sole remaining issue is the substantive aspect of reasonableness, <em>ie., </em>whether the sentence imposed by the District Court reflects a reasonable application of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>See Cooper, </em>437 F.3d at 329. In an effort to show that the District Court erred in this regard, Jackson argues first that the District Court \u201clikely penalized\u201d him for exercising his right to be re-sentenced <em>post-Booker. </em>Jackson complains that at his original sentencing the District Court \u201cimplied\u201d that it would give Mr. Jackson a lower sentence if possible, but then failed to do so on re-sentencing. Jackson Br. at 14. He also asserts (calling it \u201ctroubling\u201d) that the District Court \u201cevidenced a pattern of increasing sentences\u201d for other Carter Organization-related defendants who chose post-<em>Booker </em>resentencings. <em>Id. </em>We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-7\">First, Jackson somehow ignores the fundamental fact that the District Court did not lengthen Jackson\u2019s sentence at re-sentencing. Without any additional punishment, Jackson plainly cannot demonstrate \u201cvindictiveness\u201d on the part of the District Court. But Jackson tries to put a twist on the concept of vindictiveness. He claims that because the District Court, at Jackson\u2019s original sentencing, \u201cmade numerous comments suggesting that he would impose a lower sentence if not bound by the Sentencing Guidelines,\u201d that it was somehow \u201cvindictive\u201d of the District Court to not actually lower his sentence at re-sentencing. Jackson seeks to penalize the District Court for expressing sympathy for Jackson\u2019s situation. The District Court followed the law at the original sentencing, as it was bound to, by imposing a within-Guidelines sentence. Indeed, it is worth noticing that the District Court sentenced Jackson at the bottom of his then-mandatory Guidelines range. But the Court empathized with Jackson\u2019s situation: \u201cIt\u2019s a very sad story and one that can only make one shake one\u2019s head in compassion as one human being to another.\u201d App. F. 28.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-9\">The District Court followed the law, as it was bound to, at Jackson\u2019s re-sentencing. In fact, the District Court even issued an Order on September 11, 2006, mandating that counsel confer with Jackson specifically to discuss the possible ramifications of a <em>post-Booker </em>re-sentencing, which Judge Posner had identified in <em>United States v. Goldberg, </em>406 F.3d 891, 894-95 (7th Cir.2005). In <em>Goldberg </em>(which the District Court appended to the September 11, 2006 Order), Judge Posner explained that in a <em>post-Booker </em>environment, a presumption on the part of defendants that \u201cany heavier sentence imposed on remand was vindictively motivated and therefore improper .... is a misunderstanding dangerous to criminal defendants.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 894. The misunderstanding would be dangerous because <em>\u201cBooker </em>brought about a fundamental change in the sentencing regime,\u201d so that re-sentencings occur \u201cunder a different standard, one that would entitle the judge to raise or lower the sentence, provided\u201d the new sentence was reasonable. <em>Id. </em>Note, of course, that <em>Goldberg </em>rejected a presumption of vindictiveness even when examining a sentence that had been <em>increased </em>at re-sentencing. Here, Jack<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>son\u2019s sentence remained exactly the same at re-sentencing. With no other evidence of vindictiveness, Jackson\u2019s argument fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-4\">At re-sentencing, the District Court made sure, on the record, that Jackson had met with his counsel to discuss the potential post <em>-Booker </em>ramifications. Moreover, \u201c[i]n an abundance of caution for Mr. Jackson,\u201d the Court also colloquied personally with Jackson, warning that \u201cbecause of the change in law that <em>Booker </em>made on re-sentencing, a judge may go up as well as down,\u201d and that in \u201ca number of re-sentencings in the Courtney Carter matter since <em>Booker </em>was decided,\u201d \u201c[w]e have gone in some cases below the original sentence. In others, we have given exactly the same sentence and ... we have gone above the original sentence.... It can go up. It has gone up. This is not a hypothetical conversation we\u2019re having.\u201d App. J. 5-6. The District Court asked Jackson if he would like some time to consider the implications of what the Court had told him, but Jackson replied, \u201cNo, your Honor. I\u2019m fully aware [of] what\u2019s going on at this time. I want to proceed.\u201d App. J. 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-6\">All this evinces a conscientious District Court that took seriously its sentencing responsibility and ensured that Jackson knew of the potential consequences of his re-sentencing. For Jackson to now argue that the District Court\u2019s efforts were somehow motivated by vindictiveness is, at best, simply backwards and we reject the argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-7\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-8\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the decision of the District Court in all respects.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
