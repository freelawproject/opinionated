We deny the petition for review. Because the parties are familiar with the factual and procedural history of this case, we will not recount it here.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-21\">Because the BIA affirmed without opinion, we review the IJ\u2019s decision as the \u201cfinal agency decision.\u201d <em>Falcon Carriche v. Ashcroft, </em>350 F.3d 845, 849 (9th Cir.2003). We review the IJ\u2019s decision under the substantial evidence standard; the IJ\u2019s findings must be upheld unless the evidence compels a contrary result. <em>See Tawadrus v. Ashcroft, </em>364 F.3d 1099, 1102 (9th Cir.2004). We review the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination under the same standard, as long as the IJ has established a legitimate articulable basis to question the applicant\u2019s credibility and offered \u201cspecific, cogent reasons for disbelief.\u201d <em>Farah v. Ashcroft, </em>348 F.3d 1153, 1156 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b659-22\">Substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination. The IJ supported her adverse credibility finding with specific reasons for disbelief, namely the inconsistencies between Ms. Musayelyaris testimony and that of her witness. The evidence in the record does not compel a contrary finding. Likewise, the IJ\u2019s determinations that the abuse Ms. Musayelyan suffered did not constitute past persecution, and that Ms. Musayelyan did not have an objectively reasonable fear of future persecution, are supported by substantial evidence in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>Substantial evidence in the record supports the conclusion that Ms. Musayelyan is not eligible for asylum, entitled to withholding of removal, or eligible for relief under the Convention Against Torture.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-4\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b659-23\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
