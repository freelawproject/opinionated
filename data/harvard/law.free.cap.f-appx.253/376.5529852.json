We affirm, although on different grounds than those articulated by the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-17\">I. FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b403-18\">A grand jury in the 339th District Court of Harris County, Texas indicted Knotts for delivery of more than one gram, but less than four grams, of cocaine. Knotts entered a plea of not guilty and was tried before a jury. The Texas Fourteenth Court of Appeals adequately summarized the facts that were presented to the jury as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-19\">On September 11, 1999, Houston Police Officer David Bearden [ (\u201cBear-den\u201d) ] was working as an undercover narcotics officer. While Bearden was driving along a city street looking for street dealers, he saw a man, Tealzie Randall [ (\u201cRandall\u201d) ], standing near the curb. Bearden pulled up to the curb and asked Randall where he could buy some \u201cweed.\u201d Randall got in Bearden\u2019s pickup truck and the conversation quickly diverted from marijuana to cocaine.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-20\">Bearden told Randall that he would purchase $50 of cocaine if he could get it \u201cwholesale.\u201d Bearden was directed to drive to a nearby house. Randall got out of Bearden\u2019s car and went to the door, but returned after learning the occupant did not have enough cocaine on hand to complete the transaction. Bear-den was then directed by Randall to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>drive to another location where they came upon appellant [Knotts] sitting in an automobile. Bearden gave Randall the money. Randall approached appellant and spoke to him a short while. Randall returned to Bearden with the money and said appellant wanted to move to another location to complete the sale.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-4\">Bearden drove, as instructed, to the parking lot of a nearby convenience store. Appellant followed in his car and parked nearby. Randall exited Bear-den\u2019s truck with the money and walked over to appellant\u2019s vehicle. Bearden watched as Randall got in appellant\u2019s vehicle; the two men appeared to make an exchange. Randall then exited appellant\u2019s car and returned to Bearden\u2019s truck with four \u201crocks\u201d of crack cocaine. As Bearden was inspecting the contraband, appellant got out of his vehicle, walked up to Bearden\u2019s window, identified himself as \u201cFred,\u201d and assured Bearden the cocaine was \u201cgood.\u201d Appellant also gave Bearden his pager number and told him to call when he needed more cocaine.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b404-5\"><em>Knotts v. State, </em>61 S.W.3d 112, 118-14 (Tex.App.2001). A chemist with the Houston Police Department Crime Lab testified that the cocaine weighed 1.1 grams, and Bearden testified that the cocaine weighed approximately 1.22 grams.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-6\">At trial, Knotts called Randall as his only witness.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> After Randall took the witness stand, however, the following exchange occurred outside of the presence of the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-7\">THE COURT: Are you the same Mr. Randall who the officers have alleged was present the night that this actually was supposed to have occurred?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-10\">[RANDALL]: That\u2019s right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-11\">THE COURT: All right. After listening to Mr. \u2014 the officer\u2019s testimony \u2014 and not saying whether I believe or disbelieve it \u2014 but I think you\u2019re placing yourself in the position \u2014 I don\u2019t know what your testimony is going to be. But you might be subject to being \u2014 the district attorney filing on you for committing perjury <em>if you testify to something different than what the officer testified to, </em>and I\u2019m not saying whether that\u2019s right or wrong. Just giving you your rights. You do not have to testify. But I\u2019ve got a lawyer standing by here who would be glad to talk to you about your rights. You want to talk to him about it before you testify?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-12\">[RANDALL]: Which one?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-13\">THE COURT: Sir? No, this lawyer here represents the defendant. He can\u2019t represent you. That might be a conflict of interest. You understand what I\u2019m telling you? <em>They may be filing on you for a criminal offense if you testify to something different from what the State thinks occurred.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-14\">[PROSECUTOR]: May I?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-15\">THE COURT: I want to be sure he understands what I\u2019m telling him first.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-16\">[RANDALL]: Yeah, I understand.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-17\">THE COURT: Do you want to waive your Fifth Amendment right and go ahead and testify? I\u2019ve got a lawyer standing here that can talk to you about that if you want to talk to a lawyer about it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>[RANDALL]: Well, I\u2019m just going to tell what\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-5\">THE COURT: Sir?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-6\">[RANDALL]: I was just going to tell what happened.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-7\">THE COURT: Well, I\u2019m not interested in what happened. I\u2019m interested in protecting your rights. <em>And if you say something different than the police say happened, they most likely are going to file on you for perjury. You\u2019ll be indicted. </em>If you think you can fight that\u2014 I mean, I\u2019m not saying who\u2019s right or who\u2019s wrong. I just want to be <em>sure </em>\u2014 I <em>want you to know you place yourself in a position where you could have criminal charges result from it by testifying. </em>You do not have to testify if you\u2019ve exercised your Fifth Amendment privilege. If you want to testify, you can waive that. You can certainly tell whatever you want to say. I just want to be sure you understand that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-8\">[RANDALL]: Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-9\">THE COURT: Do you want to testify?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"APO\">[RANDALL]: Right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-10\">THE COURT: All right. You want to give up your Fifth Amendment right and testify?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-11\">[RANDALL]: Right. Right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-12\">THE COURT: All right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-13\">[PROSECUTOR]: Judge, when he and I spoke this morning, he did not seem to comprehend what an along with stipulation is. And I think that \u2014 I\u2019m not sure how he can give up his Fifth Amendment right without someone explaining\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-14\">THE COURT: I\u2019ve tried to explain to him <em>if he testifies something contrary to what he\u2019s done before, he may be filed on for sure. </em>And I\u2019ve got a lawyer. He says he still wants to testify, and that\u2019s all I can do.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-15\">Do you understand that? Mr. Randall, you understand?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-16\">[RANDALL]: I don\u2019t understand what you\u2019re saying. If I testify, that they\u2019ll\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ACG\">THE COURT: As I understand, from listening to the prosecutor and having listened to the police, that you have signed some statements indicating an along with stipulation. If you would now get on the stand and deny that, they could file on you for perjury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AB2\">[RANDALL]: But I talked to my lawyer. He saw the papers that I had signed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-17\">THE COURT: I\u2019m going to \u2014 I\u2019m just telling you what can happen if you testify, and that\u2019s why you might want to talk to an independent lawyer about your rights if you want to. And I\u2019ve got one standing by to talk to you if you want to talk to that person. You can give up that right though and testify.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AmE\">[PROSECUTOR]: <em>And if you would explain he\u2019s on probation out of this court, if he is filed on for a nexo offense, they will also be filing a motion to revoke his probation.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-18\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: Judge, I think all of this \u2014 I mean, that\u2019s all trying to explain to this guy; but it\u2019s untruthful testimony\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-19\">THE COURT: Okay. I know \u2014 and I\u2019m not saying what\u2019s truthful and what\u2019s not truthful. I don\u2019t think \u2014 Mr. Justin, would you talk to him and explain to him?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-20\">MR. JUSTIN [appointed counsel]: Can I take him out in the witness room? THE COURT: Sure. Go in the witness room and talk to him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-21\">(Brief recess.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-22\">THE COURT: All right. Bring Mr. Randall back to the stand.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-23\">THE COURT: You are Mr. Tealzie Randall; is that right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>[RANDALL]: Right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-4\">THE COURT: Mr. Randall, you talked to a lawyer now. You may testify if you want to testify, or you may claim your Fifth Amendment right if you do not want to testify. What do you want to do?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-5\">[RANDALL]: I believe I\u2019m going to have to take the Fifth.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-6\">THE COURT: You want to take the Fifth Amendment?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-7\">[RANDALL]: Right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-8\">THE COURT: You do not want to testify then?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-9\">[RANDALL]: No, because they \u2014 if I testify, they said they\u2019ll revoke my probation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-10\">THE COURT: Well, I can\u2019t go into that. You want to invoke your Fifth Amendment privilege or not? That\u2019s all I want to know.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-11\">[RANDALL]: Right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-12\">THE COURT: All right.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b406-13\"><em>Knotts, </em>61 S.W.3d at 114-16. Randall thus did not testify, and on May 16, 2000, the jury convicted Knotts for delivery of cocaine and sentenced him to life in prison as a habitual offender.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-14\">On direct appeal, Knotts argued, in part, that he was denied due process of law when Randall refused to testify because of the intimidating warnings and threats of the trial court and prosecution. The Texas Fourteenth Court of Appeals agreed with Knotts that a constitutional error resulted from the trial court\u2019s admonition and prosecution\u2019s threat to Randall, but held that they were harmless and thus affirmed his conviction on October 25, 2001. The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals refused Knotts\u2019s petition for discretionary review on April 10, 2002. Knotts then filed a state application for a writ of habeas corpus on June 30, 2003, but the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals denied it without a written order, based on the findings of the trial court, on November 5, 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-16\">On November 13, 2003, Knotts, proceeding <em>pro se, </em>filed a federal petition for a writ of habeas corpus, which presented six claims for review, including his witness intimidation argument. On February 11, 2005, the district court, however, granted the Director of the Texas Department of Criminal Justice\u2019s (\u201cthe Director\u201d) motion for summary judgment, dismissed Knotts\u2019s petition, and denied Knotts\u2019s request for a certificate of appealability (\u201cCOA\u201d). On June 13, 2005, Knotts filed a motion for a COA in this Court, and on July 10, 2005, this Court granted a COA on the following issue: \u201c[W]hether the district court properly concluded that the state appellate court\u2019s application of harmless error analysis to Knotts\u2019s witness intimidation claim did not constitute an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law as determined by the Supreme Court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b406-17\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b406-18\">On a federal habeas appeal, \u201cwe review the district court\u2019s findings of fact for clear error and review its conclusions of law de novo, applying the same standard of review to the state court\u2019s decision as the district court.\u201d <em>Garcia v. Quarterman, </em>454 F.3d 441, 444 (5th Cir.2006) (internal quotations omitted). \u201cIf the issue is a mixed question of law and fact, such as the assessment of harmless error, we review the district court\u2019s determination de novo.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b406-19\">Knotts filed his federal habeas petition after the effective date of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (\u201cAEDPA\u201d) and thus the deferential AED-PA standard of review applies to his claim. <em>See Lindh v. Murphy, </em>521 U.S. 320, 336, 117 S.Ct. 2059, 138 L.Ed.2d 481 (1997); <em>Hill v. Johnson, </em>210 F.3d 481, 484 (5th Cir.2000). Under AEDPA, this Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>evaluates the merits determination of the state habeas court to determine if it either \u201c(1) resulted in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States; or (2) resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State coui\u2019t proceeding.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d). The reference to \u201cclearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States\u201d in \u00a7 2254(d)(1) \u201crefers to the holdings, as opposed to the dicta, of [the] Court\u2019s decisions as of the time of the relevant state-court decision.\u201d <em>Yarborough v. Alvarado, </em>541 U.S. 652, 660-61, 124 S.Ct. 2140, 158 L.Ed.2d 938 (2004) (internal quotations omitted). Reviewing courts are to \u201clook for the governing legal principle or principles set forth by the Supreme Court\u201d at that time. <em>Id. </em>at 661, 124 S.Ct. 2140 (internal quotations omitted). A decision is contrary to established federal law when it \u201creaches a legal conclusion in direct conflict with a prior decision of the Supreme Court or if it reaches a different conclusion than the Supreme Court based on materially indistinguishable facts.\u201d <em>Miniel v. Cockrell, </em>339 F.3d 331, 337 (5th Cir.2003). This Court notes that a state court\u2019s decision will not be disturbed where it is premised on an erroneous or incorrect, but not unreasonable, application of federal law. <em>Williams v. Taylor, </em>529 U.S. 362, 410, 120 S.Ct. 1495, 146 L.Ed.2d 389 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">III. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">The Fifth, Sixth, and Fourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution concomitantly provide a criminal defendant with the constitutional right to present a defense by compelling the attendance and presenting the testimony of his own witnesses. <em>Pennsylvania v. Ritchie, </em>480 U.S. 39, 56, 107 S.Ct. 989, 94 L.Ed.2d 40 (1987); <em>Washington v. Texas, </em>388 U.S. 14, 18-19, 87 S.Ct. 1920, 18 L.Ed.2d 1019 (1967). This right guarantees that a defendant may \u201cpresent witnesses to establish his defense without fear of retaliation against the witness by the government\u201d or any other improper governmental interference. <em>United States v. Bieganowski, </em>313 F.3d 264, 291 (5th Cir.2002) (internal quotations omitted). The Supreme Court has stated that this particular \u201cright is a fundamental element of due process of law.\u201d <em>Washington, </em>388 U.S. at 19, 87 S.Ct. 1920. The government, therefore, cannot substantially interfere with a defense witness\u2019s decision to testify without violating the defendant\u2019s due process rights. <em>Webb v. Texas, </em>409 U.S. 95, 98, 93 S.Ct. 351, 34 L.Ed.2d 330 (1972) (per curiam); <em>Bieganowski, </em>313 F.3d at 291. However, in order to demonstrate such a substantial interference and thus a due process violation, the defendant must show a causal connection between the governmental action and the witness\u2019s decision not to testify. <em>See Bieganowski, </em>313 F.3d at 291-92; <em>United States v. Thompson, </em>130 F.3d 676, 687 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b407-8\">In the instant case, the state appellate court applied <em>Webb </em>and held that \u201cthe tenor and persistence of the warnings [given to Randall by the trial judge] were [constitutionally] improper.\u201d <em>Knotts, </em>61 S.W.3d at 117. The court also found constitutional error in the substance of the trial court\u2019s warnings, which defined perjury as any statement that contradicted the government\u2019s version of events, and in the prosecution\u2019s threat to revoke Randall\u2019s parole if he testified. <em>Id. </em>The court held that the intimidating statements made to Randall, Knotts\u2019s sole witness at trial, constituted a substantial interference with Knotts\u2019s right to present witnesses in his defense. <em>Id. </em>at 118. Nevertheless, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>court found this error to be harmless because \u201cdespite the coercive nature of the admonitions, the witness persisted in waiving his Fifth Amendment privilege. Only after the witness consulted with appointed counsel did he decide not to testify.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The state habeas court found no error with the state appellate court\u2019s application of harmless error in this instance.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-4\">In his federal habeas petition, Knotts argues that the state court failed to apply clearly established federal law as established by the Supreme Court when it engaged in harmless error analysis for his witness intimidation claim. The Director, on the other hand, argues that the state court\u2019s application of harmless error analysis was not an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law. The district court agreed with the Director, granted his motion for summary judgment, and dismissed Knotts\u2019s petition. This Court, however, granted Knotts\u2019s motion for a COA on one issue: \u201cwhether the district court properly concluded that the state appellate court\u2019s application of harmless error analysis to Knotts\u2019s witness intimidation claim did not constitute an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law as determined by the Supreme Court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">Based upon our review of the record and the applicable law, we conclude that the district court erred when it held that the state appellate court reasonably applied harmless error analysis to Knotts\u2019s witness intimidation claim. In our view, the state court\u2019s analysis of harmless error was itself error. As previously stated, the state court found a due process violation, but held that it was harmless because Randall refused to testify based on the advice of independent counsel, not the trial court\u2019s perjury admonitions or the prosecution\u2019s threats. Instead of considering whether the improper admonitions and threats caused Randall not to testify in its harmless error analysis, the state court should have considered whether the purported due process violation (prevention of Randall\u2019s testimony) influenced the jury\u2019s verdict, as that is the question posed by the Supreme Court. <em>See, e.g., Fry v. Pliler, -U</em>.S.-, 127 S.Ct. 2321, 2328, 168 L.Ed.2d 16 (2007) (holding that \u201cin \u00a7 2254 proceedings a court must assess the prejudicial impact of constitutional error in a state-court criminal trial under the \u2018substantial and injurious effect\u2019 standard\u201d); <em>Brecht v. Abrahamson, </em>507 U.S. 619, 623, 113 S.Ct. 1710, 123 L.Ed.2d 353 (1993) (stating that the reviewing court must consider whether the constitutional violation \u201chad a substantial and injurious effect or influence in determining the jury\u2019s verdict\u201d (internal quotations omitted)); <em>United States v. Weddell, </em>800 F.2d 1404, 1411 (5th Cir.1986) (holding that the district court, in a case involving governmental interference with a defense witness, must evaluate \u201chow [the witnesses testimony would have affected the jury\u2019s assessment of the evidence\u201d in considering harmless error). The state court, however, did not do so and its consideration of causation as part of its harmless error analysis was an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law as determined by the Supreme Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-9\">Notwithstanding, because the state court expressly found that governmental action did not cause Randall not to testify, we conclude that Knotts\u2019s constitutional right to due process was not violated under <em>Webb. </em>The Supreme Court has provided that \u201cit surely is not a requirement that federal courts actually defer to a state-court application of the federal law that is, in the independent judgment of the federal court, in error.\u201d <em>Williams, </em>529 U.S. at 387, 120 S.Ct. 1495. Given the state court\u2019s finding that Randall\u2019s failure to testify was not the result of the trial court\u2019s or prosecution\u2019s actions, we are not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>precluded from holding that the trial court and prosecution did not violate Knotts\u2019s right to due process. In <em>Webb, </em>the Supreme Court concluded \u201cthat the judge\u2019s threatening remarks, directed only at the single witness for the defense, effectively drove that witness off the stand, and thus deprived the petitioner of due process....\u201d 409 U.S. at 98, 93 S.Ct. 351. The Supreme Court linked the due process violation to the fact that the threatening remarks caused the witness not to testify. Following this holding, this Court has repeatedly held that a defendant must demonstrate a causal connection between the governmental action and the witness\u2019s choice not to testify. <em>See Bieganowski, </em>313 F.3d at 291-92; <em>Thompson, </em>130 F.3d at 687; <em>United States v. Viera, </em>839 F.2d 1113, 1115 (5th Cir.1988). Consequently, the state court should have simply held that there was no due process violation, which would have obviated any harmless error analysis. <em>See United States v. Saunders, </em>943 F.2d 388, 393 (4th Cir.1991) (\u201cBecause [the defendant] has not demonstrated a due process violation, we need not reach the harmless error analysis.\u201d). In light of the state court\u2019s finding that Randall\u2019s failure to testify was attributable solely to Randall\u2019s legitimate invocation of his Fifth Amendment right based on the advice of independent counsel \u2014 and not governmental action \u2014 there can be no showing that Knotts\u2019s constitutional right to due process was actually violated. Therefore, the district court\u2019s ultimate denial of Knotts\u2019s petition for habeas relief was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">IY. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b409-6\">The district court\u2019s denial of Knotts\u2019s petition for a writ of habeas corpus is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b403-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
