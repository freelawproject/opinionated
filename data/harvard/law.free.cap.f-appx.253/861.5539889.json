(\u201cLanier\u201d) on a work and labor performed claim, and awarded a judgment for the balance due, in addition to relief under Alabama\u2019s Miller Act of 12 percent per annum interest and attorneys\u2019 fees. On appeal, Car-bone contends that the district court erred in (1) granting relief under Alabama\u2019s Miller Act because of the constraints of the law-of-the-case doctrine and Fed.R.Civ.P. 54(c); (2) excluding evidence as to the reasonable value of Lanier\u2019s services; and (3) establishing the attorneys\u2019 fee award. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"863\">*863</page-number>After thorough review of the record, we affirm the district court\u2019s decision in all respects except we vacate the award of attorneys\u2019 fees, and remand this limited issue to afford Carbone the opportunity to respond to Lanier\u2019s evidentiary submissions on the reasonable amount of the fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-5\">We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s application of the law-of-the-case doctrine. <em>See Alphamed, Inc. v. B. Braun Med., Inc., </em>367 F.3d 1280, 1285-86 (11th Cir.2004). We review each of Carbone\u2019s remaining claims for abuse of discretion. <em>See Carter v. Diamondback Golf Club, Inc., </em>222 Fed. Appx. 929, 931 n. 1 (11th Cir.2007) (reviewing a district court\u2019s application of Rule 54(c) to award unpled damages for abuse of discretion); <em>Hodges v. United States, </em>597 F.2d 1014, 1018 (5th Cir.1979)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (reviewing a district court\u2019s decision to bar evidence based on its interpretation of a pretrial order for abuse of discretion); <em>Drill South, Inc. v. Int\u2019l Fid. Ins. Co., </em>234 F.3d 1232, 1239 (11th Cir.2000) (reviewing a district court\u2019s award of attorneys\u2019 fees for abuse of discretion).</p>\n<p id=\"b889-6\">First, Carbone argues that in light of the law-of-the-case doctrine, the district court erred by granting Lanier 12 percent interest and attorneys\u2019 fees under the Miller Act after the court denied Lanier\u2019s motion for leave to amend its complaint to assert a Miller Act claim.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-7\">We have held that if a district court decision is interlocutory and subject to reconsideration, any constraints of the law-of-the-case doctrine are inapplicable. <em>See Gregg v. U.S. Indus., Inc., </em>715 F.2d 1522, 1530 (11th Cir.1983) (\u201cOrdinarily law of the case applies only where there has been a final judgment and not to interlocutory rulings.\u201d). <em>Cf. Toole v. Baxter Healthcare Corp., </em>235 F.3d 1307, 1315 (11th Cir.2000) (\u2018\u201cSince an order granting a new trial is an interlocutory order, the district court has plenary power over it----\u2019\u201d) (citation omitted); <em>Bon Air Hotel, Inc. v. Time, Inc., </em>426 F.2d 858, 862 (5th Cir.1970) (\u201cbecause the order was interlocutory, \u2018the court at any time before final decree (could) modify or rescind it\u2019 \u201d) (citation omitted). Here, the district court\u2019s denial of Lanier\u2019s motion for leave to amend the complaint was simply an interlocutory decision, <em>see Smith v. Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., </em>569 F.2d 325, 326 (5th Cir.1978) (characterizing ruling on motion to amend complaint to include punitive damages as interlocutory order), which the district court had ample discretion to reconsider. We therefore conclude that the law-of-the-case doctrine does not apply in this instance.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-13\">Second, Carbone argues that the district court\u2019s award of Miller Act relief was nonetheless a violation of Fed.R.Civ.P. 54(c), upon which the district court relied. Rule 54(c), says Carbone, does not permit district courts to grant unpled relief if that relief is based on an issue not squarely presented and litigated at trial with the express or implied consent of the parties. We are unpersuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-14\">This Court has held that \u201cissues not raised in the pleadings may be treated as if they were properly raised when they are \u2018tried by express or implied consent of the parties,\u2019 Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 15(b), <em>or are included in a pretrial order.\u201d Steger v. Gen. Elec. Co., </em>318 F.3d 1066, 1077 (11th Cir.2003) (emphasis added) (citing <em>Drill South, </em>234 F.3d at 1239 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"864\">*864</page-number>(\u201c[W]e do not believe that the district court abused its discretion in its decision to award Drill South fees despite its apparent failure to plead its entitlement to fees in its cross-claim against International Fidelity. The pre-trial order in this action clearly stated Drill South\u2019s intent to recover attorneys\u2019 fees from International Fidelity.\u201d)); <em>State Treasurer of the State of Michigan v. Barry, </em>168 F.3d 8, 9-10 (11th Cir.1999); <em>Ins. Co. of N. Am. v. M/V Ocean Lynx, </em>901 F.2d 934, 941 (11th Cir.1990). Here, Lanier stated in the joint proposed pretrial order that it sought Miller Act relief \u2014 to wit, it sought \u201cpre-judgment interest on liquidated damages at the rate of either 12% or 6% per annum and the attorneys\u2019 fees and costs incurred in bringing and prosecuting this action\u201d\u2014 and, even more notably, Carbone expressly responded in that order that <em>\u201cDefendant agrees that Plaintiff seeks these types of damages.\u201d </em>(emphasis added). Lanier plainly included its demand for Miller Act relief in the joint proposed pretrial order,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and the district court therefore did not abuse its discretion in awarding this relief via Rule 54(c).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b890-6\">Third, Carbone argues that the district court abused its discretion by precluding Carbone from introducing evidence at trial as to the reasonable value of the work performed by Lanier \u2014 the measure of damages for a \u201cwork and labor performed\u201d claim. <em>See Harbert Int\u2019l, Inc. v. Sunbelt Safety &amp; Barricade, Inc., </em>668 So.2d 848, 850 (Ala.Civ.App.1995). However, this matter is not properly before this Court because Carbone failed to make an offer of proof at trial and has not informed this Court of the substance of any evidence excluded. We have made clear that we \u201cwill not even consider the propriety of the decision to exclude the evidence at issue, if no offer of proof was made at trial.\u201d <em>United States v. Winkle, </em>587 F.2d 705, 710 (5th Cir.1979) (citing Fed.R.Evid. 103(a)(2)). Because Carbone has not indicated what evidence it would have proffered to demonstrate that the value of Lanier\u2019s services was unreasonable, we cannot find that the district court abused its discretion in excluding this evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-7\">Lastly, Carbone argues that the district court abused its discretion by setting the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"865\">*865</page-number>value of the attorneys\u2019 fees award without granting Carbone an opportunity to respond to Lanier\u2019s supplemental evidence. \u201cAn abuse of discretion occurs if the judge fails to apply the proper legal standard or <em>to follow proper procedures </em>in making the determination or bases an award [or a denial] upon findings of fact that are clearly erroneous.\u201d <em>Drill South, </em>234 F.3d at 1239 (quoting <em>United States v. Gilbert, </em>198 F.3d 1293, 1298 (11th Cir.1999)) (emphasis added). We agree with Carbone that the district court abused its discretion on this limited issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-5\">Here, only after Carbone had opposed Lanier\u2019s initial brief requesting reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees, Lanier filed a motion supplementing its brief with evidentiary submissions. Carbone responded by asking the district court to either deny Lanier\u2019s motion for leave to supplement, or alternatively, to give Carbone an opportunity to respond. Without deciding whether Carbone should have had the opportunity to respond to Lanier\u2019s <em>supplemental </em>evidentiary submissions, the district court granted Lanier\u2019s motion to supplement and entered an award of attorneys\u2019 fees, costs, and expenses, based on the submissions in that supplement.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-6\">In <em>U.S. v. Skanska USA Bldg., Inc., </em>209 Fed. Appx. 880, 883-84 (11th Cir.2006),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> we held that a district court\u2019s decision to rule on an attorneys\u2019 fees motion without affording the opposing party the opportunity to submit opposition evidence violated Rule 54(d), which requires the court to afford an opportunity for adversary submissions on an attorneys\u2019 fees motion. In so doing, the Court rejected the argument that the error was harmless, because \u201cSkanska could have offered [evidence] ... relevant to the fee award.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 884. Carbone specifically asserts on appeal that a response was necessary in order for it to submit evidence relevant to the fee award, including submissions regarding the hourly rates for both attorneys and the staff, the hours expended generally, the nature of the time-consuming discovery disputes, the quantity of hours spent on the dismissed fraud/concealment claims, and whether the supplemental evidence met the burden of proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-9\">Unlike <em>Skanska, </em>the district court here awarded fees pursuant to Rule 54(c), but we see no basis to hold that a party opposing discretionary relief under Rule 54(c)\u2014 rather than attorneys\u2019 fees pursuant to a motion under Rule 54(d) \u2014 should not be permitted to respond to the evidence lodged against it. The district court thus erred in failing to grant Carbone\u2019s request to respond to Lanier\u2019s supplemental evidence. By failing to \u201cfollow proper procedures,\u201d the district court has abused its discretion, and accordingly we vacate and remand the attorneys\u2019 fees award for the limited purpose of allowing Carbone to file opposition submissions so that the district court may re-calculate the award in light of those submissions.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-10\">AFFIRMED in part, VACATED in part, and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b889-8\">. As a former Fifth Circuit case decided before October 1, 1981, <em>Bon Air </em>is binding precedent. <em>See Bonner v. City of Prichard, </em>661 F.2d 1206, 1209 (11th Cir.1981) (en banc).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b889-15\">. The Miller Act, also known as the Alabama Prompt Pay Act, provides for recovery of the amount owed plus 12 percent interest, reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees, court costs, and reasonable expenses. Ala.Code 1975 \u00a7 8-29-6.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b890-4\">. Carbone contends that Lanier did not include its demand for Miller Act relief specifically in the disputed fact section of the joint proposed pretrial order. However, the plaintiff\u2019s and defendant\u2019s disputed facts in the \u201cWork and Labor Performed\u201d section of the order and the \"Defendant's Statement of the Case\u201d section of the order discussed the elements of Miller Act relief. In light of the wide discretion afforded district courts in construing pretrial orders, we cannot conclude that the district court abused its discretion in determining that Lanier sufficiently asserted its entitlement to Miller Act relief in the joint pretrial order. <em>See Transamerica Leasing, Inc. v. Inst. of London Underwriters, </em>430 F.3d 1326, 1334 (11th Cir.2005) (\u201cA district court has \u2018broad discretion\u2019 to construe its own pretrial orders....\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b890-5\">. In any event, Carbone cannot show that it was prejudiced by the inclusion of Miller Act relief. A defendant is found to be prejudiced if \"the defendant had no notice of the new issue, if the defendant could have offered additional evidence in defense, or if the defendant in some other way was denied a fair opportunity to defend.\u201d <em>Cioffe v. Morris, </em>676 F.2d 539, 542 (11th Cir.1982). To show prejudice, Carbone argues that it might have done things differently, but does not say in any real way how it would have done so. For example, it does not say how additional damages would have impacted its settlement and litigation strategy, or how additional discovery would have affected its liability. <em>See, e.g., Baker v. John Morrell &amp; Co., </em>382 F.3d 816, 832 (8th Cir.2004) (\u201caside from Morrell's bare assertion, we have no reason to believe it would have been any more inclined to settle this claim irrespective of whether an ICRA claim was pleaded\u201d). As the Eighth Circuit has held, \"we will not permit [Carbone\u2019s] bare assertion of prejudice to thwart the amendment.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b891-7\">.
