In agreeing to plead guilty, Vazquez reserved the right to appeal the district court\u2019s denial of his motion to suppress, which he filed jointly with his co-defendant, Erasmo Perez-Leyva (\u201cLeyva\u201d). Vazquez now appeals the district court\u2019s suppression ruling. For the following reasons, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-19\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b392-20\">At 11:36 a.m. on July 21, 2005, Texas Department of Public Safety (\u201cDPS\u201d) Trooper Lucian Ebrom made a traffic stop of a Lincoln automobile, in which Appellant was a passenger and Leyva was the driver.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Trooper Ebrom had noticed the vehicle driving on the improved shoulder <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>of Interstate Highway 35, failing to maintain a single lane of traffic, and constituting a hazard to other traffic on the roadway, in violation of sections 545.058 and 545.060 of the Texas Transportation Code.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">Once the Lincoln was stopped, Ebrom exited his police car, walked to the rear of the Lincoln, and knocked on the trunk. Prompted by Ebrom, the driver, Leyva, exited the vehicle, and both men proceeded to an area on the shoulder of the highway, near the rear bumper of the vehicle. Ebrom informed Leyva that he had been swerving back and forth on the roadway and asked him if he had been drinking. Leyva answered \u201cno\u201d and immediately volunteered that he was just coming from Laredo. Ebrom then asked Leyva what he was doing in Laredo, and Leyva responded that his brother-in-law (Vazquez) was working down there. Ebrom then asked Leyva for identification, which Leyva produced. As Leyva produced his identification, his right hand was shaking, and Ebrom asked if there was anything wrong and why Leyva was nervous. He again asked whether Leyva had been drinking. By this time, DPS Trooper Fred Ogden, Jr. had arrived at the scene, and Trooper Ebrom asked him to talk to the passenger, Vazquez.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-6\">At 11:38 a.m., Ebrom asked Leyva how long they were in Laredo, and Leyva responded \u201cthree days ... yeah Friday.\u201d Ebrom then questioned how that could be correct since it was already Thursday. Leyva was unable to account for the inconsistency and also stated that the purpose of the trip was to visit his father.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-9\">At 11:40 a.m., Ebrom left Leyva and joined Ogden, who was questioning Vazquez. Ebrom opened the driver\u2019s side door of the Lincoln and put his head in the car, allegedly to better hear the conversation between Ogden and Appellant. Ebrom and Ogden then conferred and discovered various inconsistencies in Leyva\u2019s and Vazquez\u2019s stories. Ogden informed Ebrom that Vazquez claimed that the purpose of the Laredo trip was to \u201cdrop off his step-daughter\u201d and that they arrived in Laredo the previous day.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-10\">At 11:42 a.m., Ebrom returned to Leyva and proceeded to ask him about the Laredo trip. Leyva again stated that they were in Laredo for three days, they stayed at the home of Leyva\u2019s sister, and they did not bring anyone else with them to Laredo. When Ebrom continued to ask Leyva about the inconsistency of leaving Friday and only spending three days in Laredo, Leyva changed his previous story and stated that they had left for Laredo on Monday. Ebrom then informed Leyva that he was going to write him a couple of warnings. Ebrom also commented again on the shakiness of Leyva\u2019s hands.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-11\">Troopers Ebrom and Ogden then re-approached Vazquez at 11:45 a.m. and questioned him further to confirm his version of the itinerary.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Vazquez stated that they left for Laredo on Tuesday morning, arrived in Laredo on Wednesday, and stayed the night at a Motel 9 in Laredo.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-12\">At 11:47 a.m., Ebrom radioed the dispatcher and requested information on Leyva and Vazquez. After receiving the returns of information from the dispatcher, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>Ebrom and Ogden re-approached Leyva at 11:50 a.m. Ebrom began writing Leyva a warning citation for Leyva\u2019s traffic offenses and asked Leyva to look at him without his glasses on.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Ebrom then stopped writing the citation and proceeded to question Leyva as to whether he was carrying anything illegal, which Leyva repeatedly denied. At 11:51 a.m., Ebrom asked Leyva for permission to search the vehicle and all its compartments. Leyva responded \u201cgo ahead\u201d but also informed Ebrom that the car belonged to Vazquez.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-4\">Ebrom and Ogden then approached Vazquez and asked him (in Spanish) whether there was anything illegal in the car, which Vazquez denied. Ogden then asked Vazquez for consent to search the car. Vazquez gave consent and, according to Ogden, did not hesitate in any way.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">Ebrom then returned to Leyva and resumed writing the warning. When Ebrom finished, he gave the warning citation to Leyva to sign. Leyva signed and returned the warning with shaking hands. Ebrom again questioned Leyva about his shaking hands.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">At 11:55 a.m., Ebrom went to his patrol vehicle and made a radio request for a canine unit. Ebrom and Ogden then patted down Leyva and Vazquez and commenced searching the vehicle at 11:57 a.m. At no time during the search of the vehicle did Leyva or Vazquez seek to withdraw their consent to search nor did they attempt to limit the search in any way. At 12:12 p.m., Ogden located a package of cocaine hidden in the air breather compartment of the engine. Leyva and Vazquez were subsequently handcuffed, placed under arrest, and read their <em>Miranda </em>rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-9\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b394-10\">In reviewing a district court\u2019s denial of a motion to suppress evidence under the Fourth Amendment, we review findings of fact for clear error and conclusions of law <em>de novo. Ornelas v. United States, </em>517 U.S. 690, 699, 116 S.Ct. 1657, 134 L.Ed.2d 911 (1996). We review the evidence \u201cin the light most favorable to the prevailing party\u201d \u2014 in this case the Government. <em>United States v. Santiago, </em>310 F.3d 336, 340 (5th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b394-11\">III. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b394-12\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-13\">We treat routine traffic stops as <em>Terry </em>stops. <em>United States v. Brigham, </em>382 F.3d 500, 506 (5th Cir.2004) (en banc). Pursuant to <em>Terry, </em>we employ a two-part test to determine the legality of police investigatory stops. <em>Id. </em>First, we examine \u201cwhether the officer\u2019s action was justified at its inception.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Second, we then inquire \u201cwhether the officer\u2019s subsequent actions were reasonably related in scope to the circumstances that justified the stop.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Importantly, a detention \u201cmay last no longer than required to effect the purpose of the stop.\u201d <em>United States v. Jenson, </em>462 F.3d 399, 404 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b394-14\">As a primary matter, Appellant admits that Trooper Ebrom\u2019s initial stop was lawful. Appellant argues, however, that Ebrom\u2019s and Ogden\u2019s actions and questioning during the traffic stop were not reasonably related to the circumstances that justified the stop \u2014 e.g., the traffic violations and suspicions regarding driving while intoxicated \u2014 and, therefore, consent to search the vehicle was given at a time when Leyva and Vazquez were illegally detained.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>Appellant first contends that the Troopers\u2019 questioning regarding Leyva and Appellant\u2019s itinerary and travel plans before the initiation of a computer check was impermissible. Ebrom\u2019s and Ogden\u2019s actions in this regard, however, were plainly proper. An officer may \u201cask about the purpose and itinerary of a driver\u2019s trip during the traffic stop,\u201d as such inquiries are \u201cwithin the scope of investigation attendant to the traffic stop.\u201d <em>Brigham, </em>382 F.3d at 508. An officer may also \u201cundertake similar questioning of the vehicle\u2019s occupants to verify the information provided by the driver.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotations omitted). Furthermore, such questioning can occur before initiation of a computer check. <em>Id. </em>at 511 (\u201c[Njeither our prior cases nor any other case law of which we are aware institutes a per se rule requiring an officer immediately to obtain the driver\u2019s license and registration information and initiate the relevant background checks before asking questions.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">Ebrom\u2019s questioning \u2014 from the time questioning began until Trooper Ebrom called dispatch to get information on Leyva and Vazquez \u2014 lasted only approximately ten minutes. <em>See id. </em>at 509 (holding that similar questioning for a period of seven minutes before checking registration and identification was permissible).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> As in <em>Brigham, </em>these questions undeniably extended the stop a few minutes, but the process \u201crequired as long as it did for reasons beyond [Ebrom]\u2019s control\u201d \u2014 Leyva and Vazquez\u2019s inconsistencies \u201ccreated suspicion, requiring further detective efforts by [Ebrom].\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 510. Thus, Ebrom\u2019s actions constituted a \u201cgraduated response to emerging facts.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 509.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-10\">Second, Appellant contends that Ebrom\u2019s continued interrogation after Leyva\u2019s and Appellant\u2019s information came back clean from dispatch was impermissible and constituted an unlawful detention. However, long before this point in the traffic stop, Ebrom had reasonable suspicion that \u201ccriminal activity may be afoot.\u201d <em>Terry v. Ohio, </em>392 U.S. 1, 30, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 20 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b395-11\">Generally, \u201conce all relevant computer checks have come back clean, there is no more reasonable suspicion, and ... continued questioning thereafter unconstitutionally prolongs the detention.\u201d <em>United States v. Lopez-Moreno, </em>420 F.3d 420, 431 (5th Cir.2005). A recognized exception to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>this general rule is that \u201cif additional reasonable suspicion arises in the course of the stop and before the initial purpose of the stop has been fulfilled, then the detention may continue until the new reasonable suspicion has been dispelled or confirmed.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b396-4\">In determining whether reasonable suspicion exists in certain circumstances, courts \u201cmust look at the \u2018totality of the circumstances\u2019 of each case to see whether the detaining officer has a \u2018particularized and objective basis\u2019 for suspecting legal wrongdoing.\u201d <em>United States v. Arvizu, </em>534 U.S. 266, 273, 122 S.Ct. 744, 151 L.Ed.2d 740 (2002). In doing so, courts must be careful to allow \u201cofficers to draw on their own experience and specialized training to make inferences from and deductions about the cumulative information available to them that might well elude an untrained person.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">Here, it is clear that Trooper Ebrom had reasonable suspicion of legal wrongdoing that justified extension of the initial traffic stop. Specifically, the \u201cparticularized and objective basis\u201d for reasonable suspicion consisted of: (1) Leyva\u2019s nervous demeanor; (2) the glaring and unresolvable inconsistencies in the stories given by Leyva and Vazquez; (3) Leyva\u2019s internally inconsistent answers regarding the travel itinerary, including the fact that he changed his story about their date of departure to Laredo; (4) the fact that Leyva and Vazquez were traveling from Laredo, a town on the border of Mexico and the United States;<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and (5) the fact that \u2014 based on Leyva\u2019s erratic driving\u2014 Ebrom had reasonable suspicion that Leyva was intoxicated from alcohol <em>or drugs. </em>Thus, even if Ebrom did extend the initial stop by asking Leyva and Vazquez questions after the computer check came back clean, such extension was justified by reasonable suspicion that arose \u201cin the course of the stop and before the initial purpose of the stop ha[d] been fulfilled.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>Lopez-Moreno, </em>420 F.3d at 431.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-8\">Contrary to the arguments of Appellant, and the fears of the district court, this analysis is not in tension with <em>United States v. Santiago, </em>310 F.3d 336 (5th Cir.2002), <em>United States v. Jones, </em>234 F.3d 234 (5th Cir.2000), or <em>United States v. Dortch, </em>199 F.3d 193 (5th Cir.1999). First, as explained in <em>Brigham, </em>these cases do not prevent an officer from asking a driver and the vehicle\u2019s occupants questions about the purpose and itinerary of them trip before initiating a computer check. 382 F.3d at 510. In fact, in <em>Santiago </em>and <em>Jones, </em>the officers \u201cinterrogated the drivers and their passengers before initiating the relevant computer checks, and this court did not criticize the order of investigation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 511 n. 12. Second, <em>Santiago, Jones, </em>and <em>Dortch </em>are distinguishable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>because the Court in these cases determined that no reasonable suspicion existed to prolong the stop after the computer checks came back clean \u2014 specifically, the Court in these cases determined that nervousness and inconsistencies in stories <em>by themselves </em>were not enough to create reasonable suspicion of legal wrongdoing. <em>See Santiago, </em>310 F.3d at 342 (holding that nervousness and the conflicting statements of the passenger and driver did not constitute reasonable suspicion for the officer to continue his interrogation after the computer checks came back clean); <em>Jones, </em>234 F.3d at 241-42 (finding that inconsistent answers, contradictory responses, and acknowledgment of a previous arrest on a crack-cocaine charge was not enough to give the officer reasonable suspicion to detain the passenger and driver after the computer check came back clean); <em>Dortch, </em>199 F.3d at 199 (holding that nervousness, inconsistencies in story, and the defendant\u2019s absence as an authorized driver on the rental agreement did not provide reasonable suspicion to prolong the traffic stop after the computer check came back clean). In the case at hand, however, as explained above, there is <em>additional </em>evidence supporting reasonable suspicion\u2014 namely that Leyva and Vazquez were coming from a town on the border of the United States and Mexico and that Ebrom had suspicions that Leyva was potentially intoxicated from alcohol or drugs at the time he stopped Leyva.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> This information, <em>in combination </em>with Leyva\u2019s nervousness and the inconsistencies in Leyva and Vazquez\u2019s story, was plainly enough to create reasonable suspicion to justify the continued questioning of Leyva and Vazquez after the computer check. <em>See United States v. Rodriguez-Flores, </em>249 Fed.Appx. 317, 322-23 (5th Cir.2007) (holding that evidence of the defendant\u2019s lies regarding his itinerary and arrest record <em>plus </em>the fact that the vehicle had recently crossed the border from Mexico amounted to reasonable suspicion of criminal activity).</p>\n<p id=\"b397-7\">Consequently, Ebrom obtained consent to search the vehicle during a time in which Appellant and Leyva were lawfully detained.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-8\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-9\">Appellant further argues that even if Leyva and Vazquez were not unlawfully detained at the time consent to search was given, the consent was ineffective because it was (1) involuntarily given and (2) not an independent act of free will. We find, however, that consent to search the vehicle was voluntarily given and an independent act of free will for essentially the same reasons stated by the district court.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b397-10\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b397-11\">For the foregoing reasons, the ruling of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b392-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b392-21\">. The entire stop was visually recorded by a camera mounted in Trooper Ebrom\u2019s police car, which was activated when Ebrom turned on his overhead emergency lights to pull over the Lincoln.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b393-7\">. Trooper Ebrom testified: \"I observed [the vehicle] swerve onto the improved shoulder of the solid white line with both right-side tires. The vehicle then swerved back into its lane and then swerved back across the center stripe and traveled on the center stripe for a short period of time. It repeated this act\u00edon \u2014 I believe in my report at least three times.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b393-14\">. Trooper Ogden conducted the conversation in Spanish, as Vazquez allegedly did not understand or speak English.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b394-7\">. Ebrom testified that he wanted to look at Leyva's eyes to \u201cconfirm his story about him not having anything to drink.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b395-6\">. For reasons explained <em>infra, </em>Trooper Ebrom had reasonable suspicion of other criminal activity before he initiated the computer check \u2014 most likely at approximately 11:42 a.m. At the very least, Ebrom\u2019s questions regarding purpose and itinerary for the five minutes between the start of questioning and the development of reasonable suspicion were permissible under <em>Brigham.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b395-7\">. Appellant argues that <em>Brigham </em>is distinguishable because the suspicions of the officer in <em>Brigham </em>were aroused immediately by the fact that the driver of the vehicle was not the lessee and that the lessee was not in the vehicle. The Court, however, stated unequivocally that an officer may \"ask about the purpose and itinerary of a driver\u2019s trip during the traffic stop.\u201d 382 F.3d at 508. Furthermore, the Court stated that the officer\u2019s questions during the seven minutes \"effectuated the purpose of the [initial] stop.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 509. Thus, the officer\u2019s initial questioning regarding purpose and itinerary in <em>Brigham </em>was permissible, irrespective of any reasonable suspicion developed during the stop. This is indistinguishable from the case at hand.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b395-13\">. Appellant claims that Ebrom\u2019s and Ogden\u2019s actions were impermissible because they routinely questioned motorists about their trip\u2019s purpose and itinerary \u2014 often upwards of ten minutes \u2014 regardless of the reason for the stop. However, as discussed, Ebrom\u2019s and Ogden\u2019s actions in this case were permissible, and \"courts may not scrutinize the motives behind otherwise permissible police actions.\u201d <em>Brigham, </em>382 F.3d at 510 (citing <em>Whren v. United States, </em>517 U.S. 806, 811-13, 116 S.Ct. 1769, 135 L.Ed.2d 89 (1996)).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b396-6\">. This factor is relevant because Mexico is \"a common origin of illicit drugs,\u201d <em>United States v. Estrada, </em>459 F.3d 627, 632 (5th Cir.2006) (internal quotations omitted), and Laredo is a \u201cknown source of drugs\u201d for parts of Texas, <em>Ramon v. Texas, </em>No. 05-00-00587-CR, 2001 WL 761809, at *3 (Tex.App. July 9, 2001) (not designated for publication). <em>Cf. United States v. Brignoni-Ponce, </em>422 U.S. 873, 884-85, 95 S.Ct. 2574, 45 L.Ed.2d 607 (1975) (permitting border patrol agents to consider \"the characteristics of the area in which they encounter a vehicle\" and the vehicle's \"proximity to the border\u201d in determining whether reasonable suspicion exists to stop a vehicle); <em>Estrada, </em>459 F.3d at 632 (taking into account a vehicle's recent border crossing in determining reasonable suspicion).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b396-10\">. Ebrom certainly had such reasonable suspicion before the initiation of the computer check, most likely as early as approximately 11:42 a.m. It was at this point that Ebrom became aware of the glaring and unresolvable inconsistencies between Leyva and Vazquez's stories, and the other factors giving Ebrom reasonable suspicion already existed by this time.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b397-5\">. Although the district court found reasonable suspicion based only on Leyva and Appellant\u2019s \"conflicting stories\u201d and \"Leyva\u2019s nervous behavior,\u201d a conclusion regarding reasonable suspicion is a question of law, which this Court reviews <em>de novo. See United States v. Jaime, 473 </em>F.3d 178, 181 (5th Cir.2006) (\"To the extent the underlying facts are undisputed we may resolve questions such as probable cause and reasonable suspicion as questions of law.\u201d). Thus, this Court\u2019s determination that additional facts in the record support a finding of reasonable suspicion is permissible.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b397-14\">. The district court seemingly only analyzed Leyva\u2019s consent to search the vehicle. Appellant argues that the troopers did not search the vehicle based on Leyva\u2019s consent, but instead relied on Appellant\u2019s subsequent consent to do so. Even if Appellant is correct, the analysis with respect to Appellant's consent is essentially the same.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
