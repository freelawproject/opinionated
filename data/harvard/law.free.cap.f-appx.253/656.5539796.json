We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-14\">Regarding the First Amendment retaliation claim, we conclude that Officer Carboun\u2019s letter to the city manager, while addressing several topics of varying public interest, sufficiently touched upon matters of public concern. <em>See Cochran v. City of Los Angeles, </em>222 F.3d 1195, 1200 (9th Cir.2000) (\u201cAlthough ... not addressed directly to the public, the speech here did concern matters which are relevant to the public\u2019s evaluation of its police department.\u201d); <em>Gilbrook v. City of Westminster, </em>177 F.3d 839, 866 (9th Cir.1999); <em>see also Connick v. Myers, </em>461 U.S. 138, 149, 103 S.Ct. 1684, 75 L.Ed.2d 708 (1983); <em>Voigt v. Savell, </em>70 F.3d 1552, 1562 (9th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b683-17\">Nonetheless, the claim fails as a matter of law under the balancing test of <em>Pickering v. Board of Education, </em>391 U.S. 563, 568, 88 S.Ct. 1731, 20 L.Ed.2d 811 (1968). Here, \u201c[w]e are not dealing with the rights of an ordinary citizen vis-a-vis the government; we are dealing with the rights of a governmental employee (a police officer at that) vis-\u00e1-vis his employer.\u201d <em>Dible v. City of Chandler, </em>502 F.3d 1040, 1048 (9th Cir.2007). We conclude that, based on the totality of the circumstances, the City\u2019s interest in the efficient management of its operations, particularly in avoiding disruption of morale, \u201cdiscipline, esprit de corps, and uniformity\u201d within the police department, \u201coutweighs the interests of the public and of [Officer Carboun] in the particular statements made,\u201d <em>Kannisto v. City &amp; County of San Francisco, </em>541 F.2d 841, 843 (9th Cir.1976), in light of the \u201cpublicness\u201d and content of his speech as a whole, his motivations, and the timing, manner and context in which he spoke. <em>See Cochran, </em>222 F.3d at 1200-02; <em>Brewster v. Bd. of Educ., </em>149 F.3d 971, 980-81 &amp; n. 4 (9th Cir.1998); <em>Rendish v. City of Tacoma, </em>123 F.3d 1216, 1224-25 (9th Cir.1997). The adverse employment action taken against Officer Carboun was within the City\u2019s \u201c \u2018wide discretion and control over the management of its personnel and internal affairs,\u2019 \u201d <em>Connick, </em>461 U.S. at 151, 103 S.Ct. 1684 (citation omitted), including the enforcement of departmental regulations regarding the job-related conduct of its officers, <em>see Kannisto, </em>541 F.2d at 842\u201444.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-18\">Because we resolve the <em>Pickering </em>balance in favor of Defendants, we need not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>reach the issues of qualified immunity and municipal liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-4\">Regarding Plaintiffs\u2019 state law defamation claim, we affirm for the reasons stated in the district court\u2019s opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b683-15\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
