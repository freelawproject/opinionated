Ellis\u2019 attorney has filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), stating that, in his opinion, there are no meritorious issues for appeal. Although concluding that such allegations lacked merit, counsel claims on appeal that the district court erred in enhancing Ellis\u2019 base offense level pursuant to <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 2D1.1. Ellis filed a supplemental pro se brief raising three issues: (1) the district court erred in denying him an evidentiary hearing; (2) his plea agreement was invalid; and (3) he was improperly sentenced. Finding no reversible error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-20\">Ellis asserts the district court erred in denying him an evidentiary hearing on his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 (2000) motion. This issue is not properly before the court in this criminal appeal, and we decline to consider it for that reason. In any event, we note that Ellis received the relief he requested in his \u00a7 2255 proceeding. Thus, Ellis can claim no prejudice on account of the dispo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>sition of his motion without an evidentiary hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">Ellis next claims his plea agreement was illegally induced with an oral promise of a five-year sentence. Because Ellis did not move in the district court to withdraw his guilty plea, any error committed during the Rule 11 hearing is reviewed for plain error. <em>United States v. Martinez, </em>277 F.3d 517, 526 (4th Cir.2002). A defendant\u2019s statements at a guilty plea hearing are presumed to be true. <em>See Blackledge v. Allison, </em>431 U.S. 63, 73-74, 97 S.Ct. 1621, 52 L.Ed.2d 136 (1977). Unsupported subsequent allegations are insufficient to overcome representations at the hearing. <em>Id. </em>at 74, 97 S.Ct. 1621; <em>see also United States v. DeFusco, </em>949 F.2d 114, 119 (4th Cir.1991) (stating defendant\u2019s statement at Fed.R.Crim.P. 11 hearing that he was neither coerced nor threatened was \u201cstrong evidence of the voluntariness of his plea\u201d); <em>Via v. Superintendent, Powhatan Corr. Ctr., </em>643 F.2d 167, 171 (4th Cir.1981) (holding statements made at plea hearing that facially demonstrate plea\u2019s validity conclusive absent compelling reason why they should not be, such as ineffective assistance of counsel).</p>\n<p id=\"b331-6\">At Ellis\u2019 plea hearing, he testified he read and discussed the plea agreement with counsel. When asked by the court, Ellis responded no one had made promises about his sentence other than what was in the plea agreement. He also indicated his understanding when told by the court that the probation officer may recommend another sentence after the presentence investigation and that any departures could not be appealed. We therefore find his guilty plea was knowing and voluntary.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-7\">Finally, Ellis contends his sentence was improper. He specifically objects to a two-level dangerous weapon enhancement and claims he was not given the opportunity to review the presentence report prior to sentencing. Because these claims were not asserted in the district court, we review for plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-9\">We conclude that Ellis\u2019 challenges to his sentence are belied by the record. First, Ellis testified at his rearraignment that he had read and fully understood the plea agreement, which explicitly provided that other conduct in which he had engaged, including the commission of other, similar criminal offenses, could be considered by the district court as relevant conduct for sentencing purposes. Second, Ellis unambiguously testified at the sentencing hearing that he read the presentence report and had no objections to its contents. We therefore find no sentencing error.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-10\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record in this case and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. We therefore affirm Ellis\u2019 conviction and sentence. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-11\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in. the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-12\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
