Ronald Aniello Aver-son was convicted in 2003 of conspiracy to unlawfully transport stolen property in interstate commerce. He was sentenced to twenty-four months\u2019 incarceration, to be followed by a three year term of supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-24\">After Averson began serving his term of supervised release, Averson\u2019s probation officer petitioned the district court, alleging that Averson violated the terms of his release by testing positive for cocaine and oxycodone. On June 14, 2006, the district court found that Averson violated the conditions of his release by using narcotics and sentenced him to one day in custody, followed by twenty-four months of supervised release. Six months of the super<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>vised release were to be served living in a halfway house.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-4\">Averson began supervised release in June 2006. Approximately three months later, Averson\u2019s probation officer again petitioned the district court, alleging that Averson violated the terms of his release by testing positive for cocaine. At the following revocation hearing, the district court determined that Averson had violated the conditions of his release. The district court therefore revoked supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">The district court noted that the sentencing guidelines recommended a range of four to ten months\u2019 imprisonment, but that under the statute, the district court could impose a maximum term of twenty-three months and twenty-nine days. The district court commented:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-6\">After consideration of the applicable statutes and guideline provisions, including 18 U.S.C. Section 3553(a), I am ready to impose sentence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-7\">... Mr. Averson, on a previous occasion you came before me on a revocation petition and I gave you what I think was a break. I gave you one day of imprisonment to be followed by six months in a halfway house. You have not taken the opportunity to avail yourself of that break.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b354-8\">The district court imposed fifteen months\u2019 imprisonment, to be followed by eighteen months of supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-9\">Averson argues on appeal that his sentence was plainly unreasonable because it was \u201cunduly punitive and does not serve the purposes of supervised release.\u201d A sentence imposed after revocation of supervised release should be affirmed if it is within the applicable statutory maximum and is not plainly unreasonable. <em>United States v. Crudup, </em>461 F.3d 433, 437, 439-40 (4th Cir.2006), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014\u2014U.S.-, 127 S.Ct. 1813, 167 L.Ed.2d 325 (2007). In determining whether a sentence is \u201cplainly unreasonable,\u201d this Court first assesses whether the sentence is procedurally and substantively reasonable. <em>Crudup, </em>461 F.3d at 438.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-11\">In evaluating the reasonableness of a revocation sentence, this court views issues of fact and the district court\u2019s exercise of discretion with deference. <em>Id. </em>at 439. A district court has broad discretion to revoke its previous sentence and impose a term of imprisonment up to the statutory maximum. <em>Id. </em>Moreover, a district court\u2019s statement of reasons for going beyond non-binding policy statement \u201cin imposing a sentence after revoking a defendant\u2019s supervised release need not be as specific as has been required when courts departed from <em>guidelines </em>that were, before <em>Booker, </em>considered to be mandatory.\u201d <em>Crudup, </em>461 F.3d at 439 (quoting <em>U.S. v. Lewis, </em>424 F.3d 239, 245 (2d Cir.2005)).</p>\n<p id=\"b354-12\">A sentence is procedurally reasonable if the district court considered the guidelines\u2019 Chapter 7 policy statements and the pertinent factors in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) (2000). <em>See Crudup, </em>461 F.3d at 440. A sentence is substantively reasonable if the district court stated a proper basis for concluding that the defendant should receive the sentence imposed, up to the statutory maximum. <em>See id. </em>Only if a sentence is found procedurally or substantively unreasonable will this Court \u201cthen decide whether the sentence is <em>plainly </em>unreasonable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 439.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-13\">Procedurally, the district court explicitly stated that it considered the required statutory factors and the guideline provisions in sentencing Averson. The district court expressly considered the guidelines advisory range of four to ten months\u2019 imprisonment, and Averson does not argue that the court failed to consider any pertinent sentencing factors under \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b355-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>Substantively, the district court sufficiently stated a proper basis for its decision to sentence Averson above the guidelines range. The district court\u2019s comments indicate that it imposed a sentence above the guidelines range because Averson\u2019s breach of trust was a repeat violation following an instance of extreme leniency. <em>See generally </em>USSG Ch.7, Pt.A, intro, comment. 3(b) (\u201c[A]t revocation the court should sanction primarily the defendant\u2019s breach of trust.\u201d); <em>see also Crudup, </em>461 F.3d at 440 (affirming the imposition of the statutory maximum sentence when the appellant had repeatedly violated numerous conditions of his supervised release). The district court also noted Averson\u2019s need for substance abuse treatment and required that he participate in a drug treatment program as a condition of supervised release. Based on the broad discretion that a district court has to revoke supervised release and impose a term of imprisonment up to the statutory maximum, Aver-son\u2019s sentence was not unreasonable. Therefore, we find Averson\u2019s sentence was not plainly unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">Accordingly, we affirm the sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
