The government argues that we do not have jurisdiction to review the IJ and BIA\u2019s findings that Cubides filed his asylum application untimely and no changed or extraordinary circumstances excuse the untimely filing.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-18\">We review subject-matter jurisdiction <em>de novo. Brooks v. Ashcroft, </em>283 F.3d 1268, 1272 (11th Cir.2002). An alien can apply for asylum if he \u201cdemonstrates by clear and convincing evidence that the application has been filed within 1 year after the date of the alien\u2019s arrival in the United States.\u201d INA \u00a7 208(a)(2)(B), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(2)(B). However, \u201c[a]n application for asylum of an alien may be considered ... if the alien demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Attorney General either the existence of changed circumstances which materially affect the applicant\u2019s eligibility for asylum or extraordinary circumstances relating to the delay in filing an application within the period specified....\u201d INA \u00a7 208(a)(2)(D), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(2)(D). Notwithstanding the BIA\u2019s authority to consider an untimely asylum application in circumstances where the applicant meets one of the exceptions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"860\">*860</page-number>to the one-year deadline, \u201cno court shall have jurisdiction to review any determination of the Attorney General under [section 1158(a)(2) ].\u201d <em>Mendoza v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>327 F.3d 1283, 1287 (11th Cir.2003) (quoting INA \u00a7 208(a)(3), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(3)) (alteration in original). We have held that \u00a7 1158(a)(3) divests our jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s determinations that an asylum applicant filed an untimely application and failed to establish changed or extraordinary circumstances to excuse his untimely filing. <em>Delgado v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>487 F.3d 855, 860 (11th Cir.2007) (citing <em>Mendoza, </em>327 F.3d at 1287). We have also held that the jurisdictional provisions in the REAL ID Act of 2005, Pub.L. No. 109-13, 119 Stat. 231, 310 (2005), did not alter our jurisdiction over this matter. <em>Delgado, </em>487 F.3d at 860 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b886-5\">Here, the BIA determined that Cu-bides\u2019s asylum application was untimely and that he had failed to establish changed or extraordinary circumstances to excuse his untimeliness. Therefore, we lack jurisdiction to consider whether the BIA erred in this regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-6\">Cubides argues that the totality of the death threats by the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (\u201cFARC\u201d) shows that he has a well-founded fear of future persecution based on his political opinion, entitling him to withholding of removal. Cubides argues that his case is distinguishable from <em>Sepulveda, </em>because Sepulveda was threatened by the National Liberation Army (\u201cELN\u201d), a lesser terrorist group than the FARC, and she received only three telephone calls over a short period of time, while Cubides\u2019s situation was objectively and subjectively more severe.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-7\">When the BIA issues a decision, we review only that decision, \u201cexcept to the extent that the BIA expressly adopts the IJ\u2019s decision.\u201d <em>Rodriguez Morales v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>488 F.3d 884, 890 (11th Cir.2007) (citation omitted). In this case, the BIA issued its own decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-9\">To the extent that the BIA\u2019s decision was based on a legal determination, we review <em>de novo. D-Muhumed v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>388 F.3d 814, 817 (11th Cir.2004). The BIA\u2019s factual determinations are reviewed under the substantial evidence test, and we \u201cmust affirm the BIA\u2019s decision if it is supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d <em>Sanchez Jimenez v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>492 F.3d 1223, 1230 (11th Cir.2007). The substantial evidence test is \u201chighly deferential\u201d and does not allow \u201cre-weigh[ing] the evidence from scratch.\u201d <em>Silva v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>448 F.3d 1229, 1236 (11th Cir.2006) (quotation and citation omitted). \u201cTo reverse the [BIA\u2019s] fact findings, we must find that the record not only supports reversal, but compels it.\u201d <em>Mendoza, </em>327 F.3d at 1287 (considering withholding of removal claim).</p>\n<p id=\"b886-10\">In a withholding of removal claim, an alien shall not be removed to a country if his life or freedom would be threatened on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion. <em>Id.; see also </em>INA \u00a7 241(b)(3), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3)(A). The alien must show that it is \u201cmore likely than not that [he] will be persecuted or tortured upon being returned to [his] country.\u201d <em>Sepulveda, </em>401 F.3d at 1232. This standard is more stringent than the \u201cwell-founded fear\u201d standard for asylum. <em>Id. </em>The applicant must show that his fear of persecution is subjectively genuine and objectively reasonable. <em>Id. </em>at 1231 (quotation and citation omitted) (asylum context).</p>\n<p id=\"b886-11\">The applicant can meet his burden by showing either (1) \u201cpast persecution in his country based on a protected ground,\u201d in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"861\">*861</page-number>which case a rebuttable presumption is created that his life or freedom would be threatened if he returned to her country; or (2) \u201ca future threat to his life or freedom on a protected ground in his country.\u201d <em>Mendoza, </em>327 F.3d at 1287. An applicant\u2019s credible testimony \u201cmay be sufficient to sustain the burden of proof without corroboration.\u201d <em>Mendoza, </em>327 F.3d at 1287 (quoting 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(b)).</p>\n<p id=\"b887-5\">While the INA does not define persecution, we have held that persecution is an \u201cextreme\u201d concept, mere harassment is not persecution, and that persecution requires \u201cmore than a few isolated incidents of verbal harassment or intimidation.\u201d <em>Sepulveda, </em>401 F.3d at 1231.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-6\">We are satisfied that substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s determination that Cubides is not entitled to withholding of removal. Cubides has not established that he suffered from past persecution in Colombia as the threatening phone calls he received does not rise to the level of persecution. Cubides also has not established that it is more likely than not that he would be persecuted in the future if forced to return to Colombia. Not only did threats to Cubides never escalate beyond telephone calls, but Cubides actually left Colombia after being threatened on two occasions, both times returning shortly thereafter, where he received more threatening calls, but nothing more. Accordingly, we dismiss the petition in part and deny the petition in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-7\">PETITION DISMISSED IN PART, DENIED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b885-14\">. Cubides does not raise any challenge in his brief to the denial of CAT relief, and therefore abandoned the issue. <em>See Sepulveda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1228 n. 2 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
