The state court denied Wolfe\u2019s ineffective-assistance, <em>Brady </em>and pre-indictment-delay claims. Because the state-court decisions were neither contrary to, nor an unreasonable application of, Supreme Court precedent, we affirm the district court\u2019s denial of Wolfe\u2019s habeas petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-21\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-22\">Donald Reynolds owned the Silver Rail Bar, where he tended bar and regularly cashed paychecks for employees of nearby businesses. Each night, at closing time, Reynolds counted the day\u2019s take, set aside <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>money for the next day\u2019s business and put all of the change in a tackle box.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-4\">In the early morning hours of September 4, 1980, officers found Reynolds dead from an apparent shooting in the parking lot of the Silver Rail Bar. Investigators identified possible leads, including Daniel Wolfe. Wolfe worked at the nearby Michigan Seat Company and frequently cashed his paychecks at the Silver Rail Bar. Officer Jerry Boyer interviewed Wolfe twice in 1981 and conducted follow-up investigations over the following years.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-5\">In December 1994, Detective Cliff Edwards spoke for the first time to Gary Raab about the incident, and Raab disclaimed knowing anything about the crime. In June 1995, Detective Edwards again met with Raab, told him that he had evidence against Wolfe and Greg Derbyshire, as well as evidence that Raab was involved in the crime, and offered Raab immunity in exchange for his testimony. Raab vaguely described having driven around with Wolfe and Derbyshire that night but insisted that \u201c[he] told [Edwards] everything that [he] possibly kn[e]w.\u201d JA 166. In August 1995, officers arrested Wolfe. In September, Raab provided details about the offense in a third statement, which he signed after obtaining a grant of immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-6\">The State tried Wolfe and Derbyshire together for the murder but before separate juries. Consistent with his third statement, Raab gave a detailed account of the murder. He acknowledged that he originally told Detective Edwards that he could not recall many of the events of the evening and explained that, after talking with Edwards, he spent \u201ca lot of nights\u201d thinking about the evening and having \u201cflashes\u201d about it. JA 559. He testified that he and Joe Griehs rode in the back seat of a car driven by Derbyshire on the evening of September 3, and Wolfe rode in the front passenger seat. While the four of them drove around town that night (and smoked marijuana), Raab overheard Derbyshire and Wolfe talk about stealing money. Derbyshire drove to the Silver Rail Bar, where he and Wolfe said that they planned to jump off the roof of the bar and steal a man\u2019s money. Derbyshire and Wolfe got out of the car, returned after some time, continued driving around and then went back to the bar. Raab testified that, while he was in the back seat of the car, he \u201cheard a noise,\u201d \u201cstarted looking out the window,\u201d saw a brief flash of light and heard two gun shots. JA 538-39. He saw three individuals \u2014 Wolfe, Derbyshire and an older man. Wolfe and Derbyshire returned to the car, after which Wolfe repeatedly said, \u201cWhy, [Derbyshire], why?\u201d JA 539. They all drove to a field, where Wolfe and Derbyshire took off some of their clothes; at that point, Raab saw a gun in Derbyshire\u2019s hand. They went to Donna Kilgore\u2019s house after that. Raab went home, heard about the incident the next day, returned to Kilgore\u2019s house and saw \u201ca bunch of change laying on a cushion\u201d and a box with checks in it. JA 546.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-8\">A jury found Wolfe guilty of first-degree felony murder of Reynolds, possession of a firearm during the commission of a felony and armed robbery. A jury also convicted Derbyshire on all three counts. The court vacated Wolfe\u2019s armed-robbery conviction and sentenced him to life imprisonment without parole for the first-degree murder conviction and to a consecutive two-year term for the felony-firearm conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-9\">In October 1997, the Michigan Court of Appeals granted Wolfe\u2019s motion to remand for a hearing on newly discovered evidence: a tape of Raab\u2019s second interview with the police and the fact that Raab was an inmate at the time of the murder. After the evidentiary hearing, the trial court denied Wolfe\u2019s motion for a new trial. The Michigan Court of Appeals affirmed his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>convictions and the Michigan Supreme Court denied leave to appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\">In 2006, the district court denied Wolfe\u2019s petition for a writ of habeas corpus. It granted a certificate of appealability on three claims: (1) the failure of the prosecution to disclose the recorded interview with Gary Raab; (2) ineffective assistance of counsel; and (3) the denial of a fair trial due to the 15-year delay between the murder and the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-7\">Under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), we may grant Wolfe\u2019s petition if the state-court rulings were \u201ccontrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1); <em>see also Williams v. Taylor, </em>529 U.S. 362, 404-05, 120 S.Ct. 1495, 146 L.Ed.2d 389 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b555-8\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-9\">To obtain relief under <em>Brady v. Maryland, </em>373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963), Wolfe must show: (1) that the evidence at issue was favorable to him; (2) that the prosecution suppressed that evidence; and (3) that he suffered prejudice from the non-disclosure, which is to say, there is \u201ca reasonable probability that, had the evidence been disclosed to the defense, the result of the proceeding would have been different,\u201d <em>Kyles v. Whitley, </em>514 U.S. 419, 433, 115 S.Ct. 1555, 131 L.Ed.2d 490 (1995) (internal quotation marks omitted). <em>See Banks v. Dretke, </em>540 U.S. 668, 691, 124 S.Ct. 1256, 157 L.Ed.2d 1166 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b555-10\">The prosecution violated <em>Brady, </em>Wolfe argues, when it failed to disclose Raab\u2019s second statement to Detective Edwards in June 1995, in which Raab gave a vague description of the events of the night and explicitly denied having any additional knowledge. <em>See </em>JA 166 (\u2018Why I, I, told you everything that I possibly know.\u201d). Wolfe argues that he could have used this evidence to impeach Raab when he later testified in detail about the night of the murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-12\">Even if Wolfe could satisfy the first two requirements of a <em>Brady </em>claim (which we need not decide), he cannot establish the requisite prejudice because his counsel impeached Raab at trial on the basis of similar evidence. At trial, Wolfe knew about an initial statement Raab gave to police in December 1994, in which he claimed he knew nothing about the murder. Defense counsel thoroughly impeached Raab multiple times on this point. <em>See </em>JA 552 (Derbyshire\u2019s Counsel: \u201cMr. Raab, when you originally spoke with Detective Edwards regarding this matter, you told him that you couldn\u2019t recall anything that occurred. Is that correct?\u201d Raab: \u201cYes, I did. I was too scared to say anything.\u201d Counsel: \u201cAnd essentially you\u2019re testifying here under what\u2019s called a grant of immunity. Is that correct?\u201d Raab: \u201cYes, it is.\u201d); JA 555 (Wolfe\u2019s Counsel: \u201cPrior to you being able to get to any kind of immunity ... you denied any knowledge at all. Is that correct?\u201d Raab: \u201cYes.\u201d Counsel: \u201cYou lied, right?\u201d Raab: \u201cI was scared.\u201d); JA 559-60 (Wolfe\u2019s Counsel: \u201cWhen you spoke to Detective Edwards the first time, you also didn\u2019t recall a lot of whatever took place. Is that correct?\u201d Raab: \u201cYes.\u201d Counsel: \u201cAnd you had to stay up at night sometimes, and you would think about it a whole, whole lot before you went to sleep and then have flashes of things. Is that right?\u201d Raab: \u2018Yes, I did.\u201d Counsel: \u201c[Y]ou needed to have a version of events that was acceptable to the Prosecution, didn\u2019t you?\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b556-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>Given the similarity between the first and second statements (that Raab knew nothing about the murder), given Wolfe\u2019s ability to impeach Raab about the difference between his first statement and his detailed recollections in the third statement and given the similarity in impeachment value of the first and second statements (they both suggested that Raab could recall the events of the evening only when he had an immunity incentive to so), Wolfe cannot show that his trial would have come out differently had he been in possession of two initial statements of ignorance rather than just one. The Michigan Court of Appeals reasonably determined that Wolfe failed to demonstrate a \u201creasonable probability\u201d that the result of his trial would have been different if the prosecution had turned over the second statement. <em>People v. Wolfe, </em>No. 193139, at 7, 1999 WL 33454812 (Mich.Ct.App. Feb.12, 1999) (quoting <em>Kyles, </em>514 U.S. at 433, 115 S.Ct. 1555).</p>\n<p id=\"b556-5\">Wolfe separately argues that \u201cthe fact that Gary Raab was under sentence at the time of [the crime] should have been disclosed to the defense\u201d because he was in a residence-home program with strict curfews and regular drug testing, which would have precluded Raab from witnessing the murder. Br. at 24-25. As the Michigan Court of Appeals correctly pointed out, however, the prosecution did not suppress Raab\u2019s status as an inmate. <em>See Wolfe, </em>No. 193139, at 7. The prosecutor provided Wolfe with a record of Raab\u2019s criminal history, which indicated that Raab was convicted of burglary on April 11, 1979, and sentenced to one-and-one-half years to fifteen years. As Wolfe\u2019s counsel admitted at the post-trial hearing, the period of that sentence covered the night of the murder. The defense, in short, possessed the relevant information, and as a result the state courts reasonably determined that no <em>Brady </em>violation occurred. <em>See Carter v. Bell, </em>218 F.3d 581, 601 (6th Cir.2000) (\u201c[T]here is no <em>Brady </em>violation if the defendant knew or should have known the essential facts permitting him to take advantage of the information in question, or if the information was available to him from another source.\u201d); <em>see also United States v. Lee, </em>188 Fed.Appx. 425, 427 (6th Cir.2006) (\u201cEvidence known (or even knowable) to the defendant does not constitute suppressed evidence under Bra- \u25a0 dy.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b556-7\">Even if the prosecution had suppressed this information, it was not strongly impeaching evidence. Rules were enforced only modestly at the residence-home program, and it was \u201ccertainly possible that people [could] violate the rules and get away with it.\u201d JA 705. Wolfe\u2019s status as an inmate does not create a reasonable probability of a different outcome.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-8\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-9\">To succeed on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, Wolfe must show (1) that the performance of his counsel, Sean Carroll, fell \u201cbelow an objective standard of reasonableness\u201d and (2) that Wolfe suffered prejudice as a result. <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 688, 695-96,104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). The prejudice inquiry, like the prejudice inquiry for a <em>Brady </em>claim, requires Wolfe to show that there is a \u201creasonable probability\u201d that, but for Carroll\u2019s deficiency, the trial would have come out differently. <em>Id. </em>at 694, 104 S.Ct. 2052.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-10\">The first defect in Carroll\u2019s representation, Wolfe claims, was his failure to \u201cindependently investigate\u201d Derbyshire\u2019s potential alibi defense, Br. at 41 \u2014 an alibi defense that Derbyshire\u2019s attorney, Ivan Brown, allegedly also did not pursue. Derbyshire claimed that, because he worked the second shift on September 3, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>1980, he \u201ccouldn\u2019t have been where the witnesses said he was\u201d on the eve of the offense. JA 643. Brown \u201c[thoroughly\u201d investigated this alibi and \u201chounded\u201d Derbyshire\u2019s former employer for evidence, but he located only a payroll register indicating that Derbyshire worked 32 hours during the week in question and that many of the other employees worked 40 hours. JA 643. Because the register also indicated that Derbyshire missed one day of work that week, Brown decided not to pursue this alibi defense further. At the post-trial hearing, Brown testified that he did not realize at the time of trial that September 3 fell during the week of Labor Day (September 1) \u2014 which could account for the missed time \u2014 but that he \u201cprobably [would] not\u201d have pursued the defense anyway because the register still suggested that Derbyshire worked fewer hours than other employees. Carroll testified that he relied on Brown\u2019s assessment of the alibi defense in deciding not to pursue the theory, though he also did not realize that Labor Day fell during that week.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-5\">\u25a0The Michigan Court of Appeals did not unreasonably apply <em>Strickland </em>in holding that Wolfe failed to satisfy the prejudice requirement. The payroll register provided ambiguous support at most for Derby-shire\u2019s alibi because the jury might not have believed that Derbyshire missed work on Labor Day, as opposed to September 3, particularly in view of the fact that other employees worked 40 hours that same week. As the district court pointed out, the records showed that Derbyshire worked during the <em>week </em>of the crime, but they \u201ccould not have provided an alibi for the <em>particular night </em>of the crime.\u201d <em>Wolfe v. Bock, </em>412 F.Supp.2d 657, 678 (E.D.Mich.2006) (emphasis added); <em>see also Matthews v. Rakiey, </em>54 F.3d 908, 918-19 (1st Cir.1995) (determining that there was no reasonable probability of a different outcome where counsel did not call defendant\u2019s employer as an alibi witness to testify that the defendant generally worked in the mornings because the employer \u201ccould <em>not </em>provide an alibi for ... the particular day of the crime\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b557-7\">Wolfe separately argues that Carroll gave ineffective assistance by failing to request the tape of Raab\u2019s second statement. But, once again, Wolfe cannot prove prejudice. Carroll thoroughly impeached Raab at trial based on his first statement in which he denied any knowledge of the event and, most importantly, he impeached Raab based on his later incentive to recall \u201ca version of events that was acceptable to the Prosecution\u201d in order to obtain immunity. JA 560. While the second statement may have provided Carroll additional fodder with which to impeach Raab, his failure to obtain a tape of the second statement does not \u201cundermine confidence in the outcome\u201d of the trial. <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 694, 104 S.Ct. 2052. The state courts thus did not unreasonably apply the prejudice prong of <em>Strickland.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b557-8\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-9\">Wolfe next argues that the \u201c15-year hiatus\u201d between the murder and his arrest violated his due-process right to a fair trial, Br. at 48, a claim that turns on \u201cthe reasons for the delay as well as the prejudice to the accused,\u201d <em>United States v. Lovasco, </em>431 U.S. 783, 790, 97 S.Ct. 2044, 52 L.Ed.2d 752 (1977). Our circuit \u201chas consistently read <em>Lovasco </em>to hold that dismissal for pre-indictment delay is warranted only when the defendant shows [1] substantial prejudice to his right to a fair trial <em>and </em>[2] that the delay was an intentional device by the government to gain a tactical advantage.\u201d <em>United States v. Brown, </em>959 F.2d 63, 66 (6th Cir.1992) (internal quotation marks omitted) (alterations in origi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>nal); <em>McKissic v. Birkett, </em>200 Fed.Appx. 463, 469-70 (6th Cir.2006) (applying this framework in a habeas challenge to a state-court conviction).</p>\n<p id=\"b558-4\">The 15-year delay prejudiced him, Wolfe claims, because he had difficulty remembering his whereabouts at the time of the offense and because his memory \u201cwent right to the heart of the case.\u201d Br. at 49. We need not decide whether Wolfe satisfies the \u201csubstantial prejudice\u201d requirement because he has not shown that the government delayed the prosecution for illegitimate reasons. <em>See Brown, </em>959 F.2d at 66 (\u201cA showing of prejudice to the defendant, without more, is not enough to prove a due process violation; rather, there must also be a consideration of the reasons for the delay.\u201d) (internal quotation marks omitted). \u201c[IJnvestigative delay is fundamentally unlike delay undertaken by the Government solely to gain tactical advantage over the accused,\u201d and thus a prosecutor may \u201crefuse[] to seek indictments until he is completely satisfied that he should prosecute and will be able promptly to establish guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Lovasco, </em>431 U.S. at 795, 97 S.Ct. 2044. Otherwise, prosecutors would be forced to file premature indictments and in some instances to file indictments that would never have been filed at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-5\">The prosecutor testified that he did not seek an indictment until 1995, because it was not until then that several witnesses came forward, including Raab, Kilgore and Griehs. Before then, the police had approached the prosecutor\u2019s office four times, and it was only on the fifth time, after these witnesses had come forward, that the prosecutor issued the charges. Once the prosecutor received this new evidence, the trial court determined that the prosecutor \u201cact[ed] expeditiously.\u201d JA 309. The Michigan Court of Appeals reasonably applied <em>Lovasco </em>when it determined that Wolfe failed to \u201cestablish ] that the prosecutor intentionally delayed this case to gain a tactical advantage\u201d and that the prosecutor in this case \u201cappropriately delayed\u201d prosecuting the case until he could establish Wolfe\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Wolfe, </em>No. 193139, at 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-8\">For these reasons, we affirm.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
