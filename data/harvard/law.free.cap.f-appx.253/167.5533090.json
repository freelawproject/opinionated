Felipe Victor Pereira Rocha requests that we find that the immigration judge (\u201cIJ\u201d) presiding over his hearing was so biased as to violate his due process rights. In the alternative, he argues that the BIA, in affirming the IJ\u2019s decision, erred by denying his applications for asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). For the reasons set forth below, we will deny his petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-18\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-19\">Because we write exclusively for the parties who - are familiar with the factual context and legal history of this case, we will set forth only those facts necessary to our analysis. Felipe Victor Pereira Rocha was born in Portugal, but his family moved to Venezuela when he was five, where he eventually became a citizen. Although he visited the United States for two weeks as a visitor in 1994, he remained a full-time resident of Venezuela until 1995 when he moved to the United States. Between 1995 and 1998, Rocha lived and worked in the United States, but he traveled to Venezuela approximately eight times. In 1999, Rocha was diagnosed as being HIV positive, and during his illness, his then-current visa expired. On April 1, 2003, Rocha was placed in removal proceedings. He conceded removability, but filed applications for asylum, withholding of removal, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>and protection under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">At a subsequent hearing, Rocha testified that he decided to file an asylum claim after he became ill and learned that Venezuela does not have the same treatments for HIV and AIDS that the United States has. He also testified that he had been harassed in Venezuela because of his homosexuality. In particular, in or around 1990, the Venezuelan police called him a \u201cwhore,\u201d struck his boyfriend, and sexually assaulted him with a gun, but he did not report the incident. In addition to Rocha\u2019s testimony, he presented the IJ with articles and reports regarding conditions in Venezuela. These articles described his brother\u2019s death,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> detailed the treatment of homosexuals, transgendered individuals, and cross-dressers in Venezuela, and detailed the treatment of those with HIV or AIDS in Venezuela.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">The IJ found that Rocha\u2019s asylum application was untimely with no excuse of exceptional circumstances, and Rocha had failed to provide sufficient evidence to prove that he was entitled to withholding of removal or relief under the CAT. The BIA adopted and affirmed the IJ\u2019s decision. Rocha timely filed a petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-8\">We have jurisdiction to review a final order of removal from the BIA pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b195-11\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-12\">Rocha first claims that the IJ was so biased against him that it was a violation of his due process rights.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We review <em>de novo </em>whether an IJ\u2019s bias resulted in a violation of an alien\u2019s due process rights. <em>Abdulrahman v. Ashcroft, </em>330 F.3d 587, 595-96 (3d Cir.2003). At a minimum, due process requires the right to \u201c \u2018be heard at a meaningful time and in a meaningful manner.\u2019 \u201d <em>Abdulai v. Ashcroft, </em>239 F.3d 542, 549 (3d Cir.2001) (quoting <em>Mathews v. Eldridge, </em>424 U.S. 319, 333, 96 S.Ct. 893, 47 L.Ed.2d 18 (1976)). In the immigration context, then, \u201cdue process requires that aliens threatened with deportation are provided the right to a full and fair hearing that allows them a reasonable opportunity to present evidence on their behalf.\u201d <em>Abdulrahman, </em>330 F.3d at 596 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). In order to ensure such a \u201cfull and fair hearing,\u201d an alien facing removal proceedings is entitled to an IJ who is neutral and impartial. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b195-13\">An IJ\u2019s statements and behavior while conducting a hearing may rise to the level of a due process violation where the IJ insults and belittles a petitioner. <em>See Wang v. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>423 F.3d 260, 265-69 (3d Cir.2005) (calling the petitioner a \u201chorrible parent,\u201d and stating that she found it \u201cinfuriating\u201d that Wang \u201cnever even one time did anything honest\u201d). However, mere discourtesy on the part of an IJ is insufficient to constitute a due process vio<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>lation. <em>See Abdulrahman, </em>330 F.3d at 597 (stating that a due process violation had not occurred even though the IJ\u2019s language \u201creflect[ed] an annoyance and dissatisfaction with [the alien]\u2019s testimony that is far from commendable\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b196-4\">In support of his claim that the IJ was biased, Rocha points to two portions of the record. The IJ questioned Rocha regarding (1) whether he has HIV or AIDS; and (2) his receipt of federal funds to pay for his AIDS medication. While the IJ seemed annoyed during these portions of the hearing, his statements and overall behavior were not so severe that he abdicated his role as a neutral and impartial arbiter. Therefore, the IJ\u2019s behavior did not rise to the level of a violation of Rocha\u2019s due process rights.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-6\">Rocha petitions for review of the IJ\u2019s denial of his applications for asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the CAT.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Where, as here, the BIA has adopted a portion of the IJ\u2019s decision, we review the decisions of both the BIA and the IJ. <em>Shehu v. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>482 F.3d 652, 657 (3d Cir.2007). We review the factual determinations of the BIA and IJ for substantial evidence, and uphold the decisions if they are \u201csupported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d <em>Balasubramanrim v. INS, </em>143 F.3d 157, 161 (3d Cir.1998) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). \u201c[T]he BIA\u2019s [and IJ\u2019s] finding must be upheld unless the evidence not only supports a contrary conclusion, but compels it.\u201d <em>Abdille v. Ashcroft, </em>242 F.3d 477, 483-84 (3d Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b196-10\">Pursuant to the Immigration and Nationality Act, the Attorney General may not remove an alien to his country of origin if his \u201clife or freedom would be threatened in that country because of [his] race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3)(A). In order to qualify for withholding of removal under \u00a7 1231, an alien must show the threat by a clear probability. <em>INS v. Stevic, </em>467 U.S. 407, 430, 104 S.Ct. 2489, 81 L.Ed.2d 321 (1984). \u201cA clear probability means \u2018more likely than not.\u2019 \u201d <em>Tarrawally v. Ashcroft, </em>338 F.3d 180, 186 (3d Cir.2003) (quoting <em>Stevic, </em>467 U.S. at 429-30, 104 S.Ct. 2489).</p>\n<p id=\"b196-11\">Here, substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s determination that Rocha failed to show that it was more likely than not that his life or freedom would be threatened in Venezuela based on his sexual preference. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>His decision to remain in Venezuela for many years after the alleged abuse and his eight extended trips to Venezuela after he moved to the United States undercut Rocha\u2019s claim that his life or freedom would be threatened in Venezuela. Moreover, he stated that he decided to file for asylum because of the lack of medication in Venezuela, and the IJ found that was the real reason for his application. Based on the record as a whole, reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence existed for the IJ\u2019s conclusion that Rocha did not qualify for withholding of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">In order to meet the requirements for protection under the CAT, an applicant must prove \u201cthat it is more likely than not that he or she would be tortured if removed to the proposed country of removal.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.16(c)(2). \u201cTorture is an extreme form of cruel and inhuman treatment and does not include lesser forms of cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment that do not amount to torture.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.18(a)(2). Rocha has not provided any evidence that rises to the level of torture. Therefore, substantial evidence also supports the BIA\u2019s and IJ\u2019s decision that Rocha was ineligible for relief under the CAT.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-7\">For the reasons set forth above, we will deny Rocha\u2019s petition for review.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b195-9\">. Rocha claims that the police murdered his brother, who was a homosexual. He provided some testimony about his brother's death, but the IJ stated that he was not sure whether it was relevant how Rocha\u2019s brother died.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b195-10\">. Before an alien may bring a matter to this Court's attention, he must exhaust his administrative remedies. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1). A petitioner has exhausted his administrative remedies before the BIA \u201cso long as [he] makes some effort, however insufficient, to place the Board on notice of a straightforward issue being raised on appeal.\u201d <em>Yan Lan Wu v. Ashcroft, </em>393 F.3d 418, 422 (3d Cir.2005) (citing <em>Bhiski v. Ashcroft, </em>373 F.3d 363, 367-68 (3d Cir.2004)). Rocha raised the issue of bias, and therefore, the BIA was on notice that this bias could have affected any of the types of relief Rocha sought to establish.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b196-7\">. Rocha also argues that the IJ's bias led him to improperly refuse to consider two pieces of evidence: (1) his brother's death; and (2) a policy statement from the Office of the General Counsel regarding HIV and AIDS policies. With regard to his brother\u2019s death, although the evidence may have been relevant to his claim, he cannot demonstrate that the failure to present this evidence potentially affected the outcome of his case because substantial evidence supported the IJ's determination. <em>See Cham v. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>445 F.3d 683, 693-94 (3d Cir.2006) (holding that the persecution of an alien's family members can be relevant to an alien's asylum claim, but the alien would also need to demonstrate that not admitting the evidence prejudiced his claim). With regard to the policy statement, the IJ did not err in his refusal to accept it as evidence because he is not bound by the policy statement, and further, counsel did not comply with the IJ\u2019s internal procedure to submit all documentation ten days prior to the hearing. For the reasons described above, we find these arguments unavailing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b196-13\">. We may not review Rocha's asylum claim. The IJ and BIA properly found that Rocha failed to file an application for asylum within one year of his last entry into the United States, and we may not review their determination that Rocha failed to show extraordinary circumstances relating to his delay in filing. See 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(2)(B), (3).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
