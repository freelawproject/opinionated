Okonkwo argues on appeal that the trial evidence failed to support his convictions. As to the conspiracy to defraud count, he asserts that the evidence showed only that he and John Adewunmi, his alleged co-conspirator, worked at the same tax preparation business. As to the remaining counts, he argues that no evidence linked him to Adewunmi\u2019s preparation of fraudulent tax returns, and that Adewunmi was acting by himself. In support, he points out that only one of the people whose tax returns were at issue ever saw or met him and only one witness placed Okonkwo in the same room as Adewunmi. Finally, Okonkwo argues that the government failed to prove that he knowingly and willfully filed the fraudulent tax returns.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-21\">We review a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence <em>de novo, </em>viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution. <em>United States v. Hasson, </em>333 F.3d 1264, 1270 (11th Cir.2003); <em>Jackson v. Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 319, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979). \u201cThe elements of a conspiracy under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371 are (1) an agreement among two or more persons to achieve an unlawful objective; (2) knowing and voluntary participation in the agreement; and (3) an overt act by a conspirator in furtherance of the agreement.\u201d <em>Hasson, </em>333 F.3d at 1270. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"2\">*2</page-number>\u201cTo prove knowing and voluntary participation, the government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that appellants had a specific intent to join the conspiracy,\u201d although a common purpose and plan may be inferred from the circumstances. <em>United States v. Calderon, </em>127 F.3d 1314, 1326 (11th Cir.1997), <em>modified on other grounds by United States v. Toler, </em>144 F.3d 1423, 1427 (11th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b28-4\">It is a felony to \u201cwillfully aid[] or assist ] in ... the preparation or presentation ... of a return ... which is fraudulent or is false as to any material matter.\u201d 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7206(2). \u201cIn a prosecution under 26 U.S.C.[] \u00a7 7206(2), the element of willfulness or intent is usually the most difficult to prove,\u201d and will usually be proven through circumstantial evidence, such as repetitive or evasive conduct. <em>United States v. Brown, </em>548 F.2d 1194, 1199 (5th Cir.1977).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b28-5\">After reviewing the record, we conclude that there was sufficient evidence to allow the jury to find that there was an agreement between Adewunmi and Okonkwo to conspire to defraud the government, and that Okonkwo had the intent to do so. Okonkwo admitted to being the president of Eagle Financial Services (\u201cEFS\u201d) and doing business as Rainbow Tax Service (\u201cRTS\u201d), the businesses that were listed as the tax preparers for all but one of the fraudulent returns.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Okonkwo stated that he was the only person to electronically file the 1999 tax returns for his business\u2014 the year in which the fraudulent returns were filed. Testimony from several of Okonkwo\u2019s employees indicated that he was exclusively responsible for printing refund checks. None of the taxpayers received the full amount of the refund paid to them and all but one check had a forged endorsement, and several refund checks were deposited into EFS\u2019s bank account. One taxpayer indicated that after she cashed her refund check, Okonkwo convinced her to return all but $1000.00 of it, falsely telling her that she still owed taxes. All of the tax returns \u2014 including returns of tax payers who dealt exclusively with Okonkwo \u2014 were prepared in such a way as to maximize the earned income tax credit and the resulting refund check by reporting non-existent income from CJB Ice Cream (\u201cCJB\u201d), a company that Adewunmi, and not Okonkwo, was involved with. Last, evidence supports the conclusion that Okonkwo attempted to conceal his conduct-all the taxpayers were paid by Okonkwo and Adewunmi in cash, and, when the IRS came to search the business location, the files for the eleven fraudulent tax returns were not found.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b28-6\">.
