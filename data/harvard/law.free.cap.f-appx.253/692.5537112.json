We affirm. Because the parties are familiar with the factual and procedural history, we will not recount it in detail here.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-8\">Solorio contends that the state trial court violated the Confrontation Clause of the U.S. Constitution by admitting hearsay statements by the murder victim, fellow Norte\u00f1o gang member, Vicente Sanchez. Guillermo Morales Diaz testified at trial that Sanchez told him that other Norte\u00f1os wanted Sanchez to kill Diaz but that he would not do so and that one of his friends would in turn kill him (Sanchez).</p>\n<p id=\"b719-9\">The trial court admitted Sanchez\u2019s statement as a declaration against social interest, admissible under California Evidence Code \u00a7 1230. The California Court of Appeal held that the admission of the statement did not violate the Confrontation Clause, finding that the statement bore particularized guarantees of trustworthiness. The district court agreed and denied Solorio\u2019s petition for habeas relief adjudicated on the merits in state court proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-10\">This Court reviews the district court\u2019s denial of a habeas petition de novo. <em>Parle v. Runnels, </em>387 F.3d 1030, 1034 (9th Cir.2004). Under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AED-PA), a federal court may not grant a writ of habeas corpus challenging a state conviction on the basis of a claim reviewed on the merits in state court unless the state court\u2019s adjudication of that claim resulted in a decision that (1) \u201cwas contrary to ... clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States,\u201d or (2) \u201cinvolved an unreasonable application of ... clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1); <em>Williams v. Taylor, </em>529 U.S. 362, 412-13, 120 S.Ct. 1495, 146 L.Ed.2d 389 (2000). Under the \u201ccontrary to\u201d clause, a federal court may grant habeas relief if the state court arrived at a conclusion opposite to that reached by the Supreme Court on a question of law or decided a case differently than the Supreme Court has on a set of materially indistinguishable facts. <em>Williams, </em>529 U.S. at 412-13,120 S.Ct. 1495. Under the \u201cunreasonable application\u201d clause, a federal court may grant habeas relief if the state court identified the correct governing legal principle but unreasonably applied it to the facts of the case. <em>Id. </em>at 413, 120 S.Ct. 1495.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-15\">At the time that Solorio\u2019s conviction became final, <em>Ohio v. Roberts, </em>448 U.S. 56, 100 S.Ct. 2531, 65 L.Ed.2d 597 (1980), and <em>Idaho v. Wright, </em>497 U.S. 805, 110 S.Ct. 3139, 111 L.Ed.2d 638 (1990), governed the admissibility of hearsay in a criminal case under the Confrontation Clause. Under <em>Roberts </em>and <em>Wright, </em>\u201ca hearsay statement is presumptively inadmissible against a criminal defendant unless the declarant is unavailable and the statement bears \u2018adequate indicia of reliability\u2019 \u2014 that is, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>statement falls within a \u2018firmly rooted hearsay exception\u2019 or contains \u2018particularized guarantees of trustworthiness.\u2019 \u201d <em>Parle, </em>387 F.3d at 1037 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b720-4\">The issue on appeal is whether the hearsay statements in this case had \u201cparticularized guarantees of trustworthiness.\u201d In finding that the totality of the circumstances surrounding Sanchez\u2019s statement rendered it particularly trustworthy, the Court of Appeal noted that Sanchez believed that his statement would make him an object of hatred, ridicule, or social disgrace in the eyes of his gang community; Sanchez feared the revelation might even lead to his death; a reasonable man in Sanchez\u2019s position would not have made the statement unless he believed it to be true; Sanchez asked for Diaz\u2019s gun; and Sanchez closed the door to Diaz\u2019s office so that others (including Solorio) could not see or hear what transpired between Sanchez and Diaz in the office. Given the totality of the circumstances, including the content of the hearsay statement at issue and the context in which was made, the state court\u2019s determination that the admission of that statement did not violate the Confrontation Clause was reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-5\">We, therefore, AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b719-16\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b720-7\">. Solorio suggested in his opening brief to this Court (at footnote 4) that the admission of certain other evidence violated his Fourteenth Amendment right to a fair trial. We declined to certify that issue for appeal (after the District Court denied Solorio\u2019s motion for a certificate of appealability), and we lack jurisdiction to resolve the merits of any claim for which a COA is not granted. <em>Beaty v. Stewart, </em>303 F.3d 975, 984 (9th Cir.2002). Also, we have held that the principle that the admission of evidence may violate due process if it renders a trial fundamentally unfair does not confer a right that has been clearly established by the Supreme Court, as required by AEDPA. <em>Alberni v. McDaniel, </em>458 F.3d 860, 865-67 (9th Cir.2006).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
