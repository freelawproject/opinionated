Roth, Senior United States Circuit Judge for the Third Circuit, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b665-9\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b665-10\">Jonathan Carter appeals the district court\u2019s order granting the Family and Child Treatment of Southern Nevada (\u201cFACT\u201d) and Clark County\u2019s motions to dismiss under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). We affirm the dismissal of Clark County, but reverse and remand the dismissal of FACT. Because the parties are familiar with the factual and procedural history, we will not recount it here.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-13\">Clark County asserts that Carter\u2019s claims are barred by Nevada\u2019s statute of limitations and that Clark County is entitled to absolute immunity. We affirm the district court\u2019s decision that Carter\u2019s claims are barred by the statute of limitations. Carter is unable to take advantage of Nevada\u2019s tolling exception embodied in the \u201cdiscovery rule\u201d because the uncontroverted evidence \u2014 namely the fact that he filed a Motion for Psychological Examination of Alleged Victim during the pendency of his criminal case \u2014 indicates that he knew or should have known about the purportedly withheld information regarding his sister\u2019s mental and/or emotional problems. <em>See Orr v. Bank of Am., NT &amp; SA, </em>285 F.3d 764, 780 (9th Cir.2002) (citing <em>Siragusa v. Brown, </em>114 Nev. 1384, 1400-01, 971 P.2d 801 (1998)). Because we affirm on statute of limitations grounds, we will not address Clark County\u2019s absolute immunity claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-14\">In addition, we note that Carter has failed to assert a cognizable claim under \u00a7 1983. The Constitution does not require the disclosure of impeachment evidence prior to a guilty plea.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See United States v. Ruiz, </em>536 U.S. 622, 628-29, 633, 122 S.Ct. 2450, 153 L.Ed.2d 586 (2002) (stating that \u201c[wjhen a defendant pleads guilty he or she, of course, foregoes not only a fair trial, but also other accompanying constitutional guarantees\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b665-15\">While we find that the district court\u2019s dismissal of the claims against Clark County was proper, the same cannot <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>be said of the dismissal of the claims against FACT. Although FACT\u2019S failure to plead res judicata as an affirmative defense is not fatal to its claim because Carter did not suffer any prejudice, <em>see Owens v. Kaiser Found. Health Plan, Inc., </em>244 F.3d 708, 713 (9th Cir.2001), we are unable to conclude that FACT may take advantage of Rule 41(a)(l)\u2019s Two Dismissal Rule. The district court improperly relied upon the contract between FACT and the State Defendants in ruling on the Rule 12(b)(6) motion because the contract was presented outside of the pleadings. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6); <em>Lee v. City of Los Angeles, </em>250 F.3d 668, 688 (9th Cir.2001). Treating the motion as a request for summary judgment pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56, the district court failed to provide the parties a \u201creasonable opportunity to present all material made pertinent\u201d to a summary judgment motion. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b666-4\">The district court also erred in finding that as a matter of law FACT and the State Defendants are in privity for res judicata purposes. The contract between FACT and the State Defendants raises material questions as to whether the parties are \u201csubstantially the same.\u201d <em>See Lake at Las Vegas Investors Group, Inc. v. Pac. Malibu Dev. Corp., </em>933 F.2d 724, 728 (9th Cir.1991) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b666-5\">Accordingly, the district court\u2019s order dismissing the claims against Clark County is AFFIRMED and the dismissal of the claims against FACT is REVERSED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b665-12\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b665-16\">. We note that this court\u2019s recent decision in <em>Goldstein v. City of Long Beach, </em>481 F.3d 1170, 1176 (9th Cir.2007), is not implicated since Carter pled guilty and therefore cannot assert that the prosecutor's failure to disclose material impeachment evidence violated a constitutional right.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
