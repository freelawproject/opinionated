Sept. 28, 2001), <em>aff'g </em>No. A31 281 809 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>(Immig. Ct. Hartford, May 30, 2001). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-4\">Lopez-De Rowley claims error in the IJ and BIA\u2019s conclusion that her conviction qualifies as an aggravated felony, because monetary loss is not an element of mail fraud as defined by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1341.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In <em>Dulal-Whiteway v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Homeland Sec., </em>501 F.3d 116, 126-28 (2d Cir.2007), we noted that a serious question exists with respect to the divisibility of statutes involving fraud. We need not resolve that issue now because our holding in <em>Dulal-Whiteway </em>made clear that to the extent a fraud statute is divisible, \u201cthe BIA may rely only upon facts to which a defendant actually and necessarily pleaded in order to establish the elements of the offense, as indicated by a charging document, written plea agreement, or plea colloquy transcript.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 131. Here, the indictment charged three different alleged frauds on Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Rhode Island, one of which involved a loss of less than $10,000. Without the plea allocution, the BIA could not determine the specific amount of loss, if any, to which Lopez-De Rowley actually pleaded, and therefore the agency improperly qualified her conspiracy conviction as an aggravated felony.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-5\">We reject, however, Lopezr-De Rowley\u2019s contention that the IJ and BIA improperly denied her application for withholding of removal. Although the BIA did not analyze Lopez-De Rowley\u2019s social group claim in light of the recently enumerated factors in <em>In re A-M-E &amp; J-G-</em>U-, 24 I. &amp; N. Dec. 69, 73 (B.I.A. Jan. 31, 2007), the BIA affirmed the IJ\u2019s decision for all of the reasons he stated. The IJ\u2019s reasons included an alternative grounds that, even if Lopez-De Rowley were a member of a cognizable \u201cparticular social group,\u201d she did not carry her burden in showing that her \u201clife or freedom would be threatened in [a] country on account of\u2019 her status as an \u201cAmericanized\u201d Colombian. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3)(B); <em>see Diallo v. INS, </em>232 F.3d 279, 284-85 (2d Cir.2000) (stating that petitioner must establish this burden by a \u201cclear probability\u201d). Because substantial evidence supports this conclusion, we affirm the agency\u2019s denial of withholding.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-8\">Finally, because Lopez-De Rowley did not challenge the IJ\u2019s denial of relief under the Convention Against Torture before the BIA, any such argument is not exhausted and we lack jurisdiction to consider it on appeal. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1); <em>Lin Zhong v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>480 F.3d 104, 119 (2d Cir.2007) (explaining this Court has consistently applied an issue exhaustion requirement to petitions for review from the BIA).</p>\n<p id=\"b90-9\">We have considered petitioner\u2019s remaining arguments and find them to be without merit. For the foregoing reasons, we GRANT the petition in part and DENY it in part; the decision of the BIA is VACATED in part and AFFIRMED in part; and the case is REMANDED for further proceedings consistent with this order.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b90-6\">. Lopez-De Rowley also argues that she did not commit a deportable offense because the United States or its agencies did not suffer any loss. As the government correctly observes, this contention does not speak to whether the conviction may serve as a basis for removal, but rather whether her conduct actually violated 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371. We therefore lack jurisdiction to consider this claim. <em>See Rodriguez v. Gonzales, </em>451 F.3d 60, 65 (2d Cir.2006) (per curiam).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
