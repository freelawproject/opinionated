No reversible error has been shown; we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-16\">In 2006, Special Agent Neil Norrman (\u201cNorrman\u201d), an officer of the United States Department of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (\u201cICE\u201d), twice visited Defendant\u2019s home to investigate possible falsifications in Defendant\u2019s petition to bring his fiancee to this country from the Phillipines. At trial, Norrman testified that, during the first visit, Defendant invited Norrman into the home after he showed his credentials and that Norrman interviewed Defendant about the immigration petition. But Defendant testified at trial that, during the first visit, Norrman quickly flashed his credentials, kicked in the front door of Defendant\u2019s home, and threatened to arrest Defendant. Defendant also testified that, at the time, he believed Norrman was an impostor posing as an immigration agent.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-17\">The events giving rise to Defendant\u2019s conviction occurred during Norrman\u2019s second visit to the residence. Norrman testified that a child answered the door and retrieved Defendant\u2019s fiancee. Norrman questioned the fiancee briefly and then asked to speak with Defendant, who was sleeping at the time. When Defendant came to the door, Norrman again showed his credentials and asked if Defendant remembered him. Defendant then pulled a gun from under his bathrobe, pointed the gun at Norrman\u2019s head, and ordered Norrman to sit down. When Norrman said he would leave, Defendant fired one shot toward Norrman, which passed over Norrman\u2019s left shoulder. Norrman immediately sat down and put his hands on the ground. Defendant then tapped Norrman\u2019s head with the gun and ordered him to lie down. Meanwhile, Defendant\u2019s fiancee called 911, and authorities were called <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"808\">*808</page-number>to the scene. While waiting for the police to arrive, Defendant said to Norrman several times, \u201cStay still, do you want to diet?]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b834-4\">Defendant\u2019s version of the events during Norrman\u2019s second visit differed slightly from Norrman\u2019s account. Defendant testified that he continued to believe that Norrman was an impostor posing as an immigration agent. Defendant also testified that he never pointed the gun at or tried to attack Norrman. But Defendant did admit that he fired a shot into the air \u201caway from\u201d Norrman.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-5\">The jury returned a guilty verdict on both counts of the indictment: (1) assault on a federal law enforcement officer with a deadly weapon and (2) discharge of a firearm in furtherance of a crime of violence. The district court then sentenced Defendant to 144 months\u2019 imprisonment. This appeal ensued.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-6\">On appeal, Defendant argues that the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction for assaulting a federal officer under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 111. He suggests that the evidence at trial left reasonable doubt that he possessed the requisite criminal intent because he was unaware that Norrman was a federal officer. Defendant contends he was acting in self defense to protect himself and his family from someone he believed to be impersonating a federal officer. Last, he argues that the conviction for discharge of a firearm in furtherance of a crime of violence must be reversed because insufficient evidence supports the conviction for the crime of violence.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-7\">We review <em>de novo </em>the sufficiency of the evidence supporting a conviction, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the government and drawing all reasonable inferences and credibility choices in favor of the jury\u2019s verdict. <em>United States v. Taylor, </em>480 F.3d 1025, 1026 (11th Cir.2007). After reviewing the record, we conclude that sufficient evidence supported Defendant\u2019s convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-9\">In this case, a reasonable jury could have concluded that Defendant used a deadly or dangerous weapon to assault forcibly, resist, impede, intimidate, or interfere with a federal official \u201cwhile engaged in or on account of the performance of official duties.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 111(a)(1) and (b). This Court has classified section 111 as a \u201cgeneral intent statute,\u201d meaning that it \u201cdoes not embody an unexpressed requirement that an assailant be aware that his victim is a federal officer.\u201d <em>United States v. Ettinger, </em>344 F.3d 1149, 1154 (11th Cir.2003) (citing <em>United States v. Feola, </em>420 U.S. 671, 95 S.Ct. 1255, 43 L.Ed.2d 541 (1975)). In other words, \u201cthe defendant\u2019s state of <em>knowledge </em>only requires an intent to assault, not an <em>intent to assault a federal officer.\u201d Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b834-10\">The Supreme Court has said that \u201cignorance of the official status of the person assaulted or resisted\u201d may negate criminal intent in certain circumstances, such as \u201cwhere an officer fails to identify himself or his purpose,\u201d and the officer\u2019s conduct \u201cmight reasonably be interpreted as the unlawful use of force directed either at the defendant or his property.\u201d <em>United States v. Feola, </em>420 U.S. 671, 95 S.Ct. 1255, 1264, 43 L.Ed.2d 541 (1975). This case does not present such a negating circumstance. A reasonable jury could have believed Norrman\u2019s testimony that he identified himself and his purpose on both visits and that he never used or threatened to use unlawful force.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-11\">Also, the jury was entitled to disbelieve Defendant\u2019s testimony at trial, which differed somewhat from Norrman\u2019s version of the facts. Indeed, \u201cwhen a defendant chooses to testify, he runs the risk that if disbelieved the jury might conclude the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"809\">*809</page-number>opposite of his testimony is true.\u201d <em>United States v. Brown, </em>53 F.3d 312, 314 (11th Cir.1995) (citation and quotation marks omitted). Because ample evidence supports the finding that Defendant assaulted Norrman with a deadly weapon, Defendant\u2019s convictions must be affirmed.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b835-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b835-17\">. Because we affirm Defendant's conviction for assault, and Defendant does not dispute that he fired a shot during the altercation with Norrman, we also affirm Defendant\u2019s conviction for discharging a firearm in furtherance of a crime of violence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
