At a change-of-plea hearing, the government proffered facts that Rosales made arrangements with an undercover agent to accept a firearm as partial payment for methamphetamine. Rosales met the agent, accepted the firearm and $8,000, and gave the agent one pound of methamphetamine. Rosales agreed that the government\u2019s proffer of those facts was accurate.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-7\">Subsequently, Rosales filed a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 habeas petition raising ineffective assistance of counsel claims. A magistrate judge recommended that Rosales\u2019s \u00a7 924(c) conviction and sentence be vacated because, pursuant to <em>United States v. Montano, </em>398 F.3d 1276, 1284 (11th Cir.2005), Rosales\u2019s barter of drugs in exchange for a firearm did not constitute \u201cuse of a firearm.\u201d The district court adopted the magistrate judge\u2019s report, vacated Rosales\u2019s sentence, and ordered that he be resentenced once the probation officer prepared an amended presentence investigation report (\u201cPSI\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b873-8\">According to the amended PSI, an undercover agent called Rosales about a deal for a pound of methamphetamine in \u2022 exchange for $8,000. The agent and Rosales made an arrangement to exchange a firearm for methamphetamine. At the meeting, the agent handed the firearm to Rosales. Rosales handed the agent a blue Wal-Mart bag, and, after the agent inspected the bag\u2019s contents, he handed Rosales $8,000. Rosales was then arrested without incident. In a subsequent written statement, Rosales acknowledged that he \u201caccepted a firearm as partial payment for a portion of the Methamphetamine.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b873-10\">The probation officer assigned Rosales a base offense level of 36, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(a)(3), and added two levels pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l) because Rosales possessed a dangerous weapon (including a firearm). Rosales objected to the two-level increase, but the district court overruled the objection and sentenced Rosales to 156 months imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-11\">On appeal, Rosales argues that the district court erred by enhancing his sentence under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l) because: (1) the undercover agent brought the firearm to the scene of the crime; (2) the undercover agent was not a co-conspirator; and (3) Rosales could not have \u201cpossessed\u201d the firearm because the district court had already determined that he did not \u201ccarry\u201d the firearm in relation to his drug offense when it vacated Rosales\u2019s 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c) conviction. Rosales contends that the court, in finding that Rosales possessed the firearm, engaged in prohibited fact-finding which violated his Sixth Amendment rights because the court\u2019s finding that he did not \u201ccarry\u201d a firearm for \u00a7 924(c) purposes precluded any further finding that Rosales \u201cpossessed\u201d a firearm.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-12\">We review \u201cthe district court\u2019s findings of fact under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l) for clear error, and the application of the Sentencing Guidelines to those facts <em>de novo.\u201d United States v. Gallo, </em>195 F.3d 1278, 1280 (11th Cir.1999). \u201cPossession of a firearm for sentencing purposes is a factual finding.\u201d <em>United </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"848\">*848</page-number><em>States v. Geffrard, </em>87 F.3d 448, 452 (11th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b874-4\">Pursuant to \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l), a defendant\u2019s offense level should be increased by two levels \u201c[i]f a dangerous weapon (including a firearm) was possessed.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l). Application Note 3 of the provision provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b874-5\">The adjustment should be applied if the weapon was present, unless it is clearly improbable that the weapon was connected with the offense. For example, the enhancement would not be applied if the defendant, arrested at his residence, had an unloaded hunting rifle in the closet.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b874-6\">U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1, comment, (n.3). \u201cThe government has the burden under \u00a7 2D1.1 to demonstrate the proximity of the firearm to the site of the charged offense by a preponderance of the evidence.\u201d <em>United States v. Audain, </em>254 F.3d 1286, 1289 (11th Cir.2001). The government need not prove that the firearm was used to facilitate the distribution of drugs. <em>Id.; see also United States v. Hall, </em>46 F.3d 62, 63-64 (11th Cir.1995) (holding that, under the plain language of \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l), the government is only required to prove that the firearm was present during the drug-trafficking offense). \u201cIf the government is successful, the evidentiary burden shifts to the defendant to demonstrate that a connection between the weapon and the offense was \u2018clearly improbable.\u2019 \u201d <em>Audain, </em>254 F.3d at 1289 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b874-7\">In <em>United States v. Shelton, </em>we held that, because the defendant admitted to the facts that the district court relied upon to enhance the sentence, the defendant\u2019s Sixth Amendment rights were not violated. 400 F.3d 1325, 1330 (11th Cir.2005). Further, because the defendant failed to raise objections to the PSI\u2019s factual statements, we found that the statements were deemed admitted as true. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b874-8\">As an initial matter, Rosales\u2019s argument that the district court engaged in prohibited fact-finding is without merit. The record reflects that Rosales admitted several times that he possessed the firearm, and, therefore, Rosales\u2019s Sixth Amendment rights were not violated.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-9\">Rosales\u2019s argument that the firearm enhancement is inapplicable because the district court already determined that he did not \u201cuse\u201d or \u201ccarry\u201d a firearm when it vacated his sentence and conviction under \u00a7 924(c) is also without merit. The government was only required to demonstrate that the firearm was present during the drug transaction, which Rosales established by his own admissions. Rosales failed to show that a connection between the weapon and the offense was clearly improbable, and his reliance on cases which discuss vicarious liability is inapposite. Thus, we conclude from the record that the district court did not clearly err by its application of \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b874-10\">Based upon the foregoing discussion and our review of the record and the parties\u2019 briefs, we conclude that the district court did not engage in prohibited fact-finding, nor did it clearly err in its application of the \u00a7 2D1.1(b)(1) firearm enhancement. Accordingly, we affirm Rosales\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
