Johnson appeals from the district court\u2019s order granting summary judgment for the City of Selah (\u201cthe City\u201d). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-6\">A. Inverse Condemnation</p>\n<p id=\"b649-7\">The district court did not err by holding that there was no genuine issue of material fact as to whether the City\u2019s actions constituted a compensable taking. The Washington State Constitution provides that \u201c[n]o private property shall be taken or damaged for public or private use without just compensation having been first made.\u201d Wash. Const, art. I, \u00a7 16. An inverse condemnation action occurs when a party seeks to \u201crecover the value of property which has been appropriated in fact, but with no formal exercise of the power of eminent domain.\u201d <em>Phillips v. King Cty., </em>136 Wash.2d 946, 968 P.2d 871, 876 (1998). A property owner is entitled to compensation where the governmental action deprived the property owner of a valuable right. <em>Manufactured, Hous. Communities of Wash. v. State, </em>142 Wash.2d 347, 13 P.3d 183, 193 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b649-8\">C.R. Johnson argues it had a vested right to develop the property using a water booster pump. Under Washington\u2019s vested rights doctrine:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b649-9\">A proposed subdivision of land ... shall be considered under the subdivision or short subdivision ordinance, and zoning or other land use control ordinances, in effect on the land at the time a fully completed application for preliminary plat approval of the subdivision ... has been submitted to the appropriate county, city, or town official.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b649-11\">Wash. Rev.Code \u00a7 58.17.033(1). A developer has the vested right to have his application processed under the regulations in effect at the time the complete permit application is filed, regardless of subsequent changes in the law. <em>Thurston Cty. Rental Owners Ass\u2019n v. Thurston County, </em>85 Wash.App. 171, 931 P.2d 208, 214 (1997). The doctrine is supported by interests of fairness and certainty. <em>West Main Assocs. v. City of Bellevue, </em>106 Wash.2d 47, 720 P.2d 782, 785 (1986). \u201cWhat vests is the applicant\u2019s right to have the preliminary plat application considered under the zoning ordinances and procedures existing at the time the applications should have been acted upon.\u201d <em>Norco Constr. Inc. v. King County, </em>29 Wash.App. 179, 627 P.2d 988, 995 (1981). A municipality should act as an administrative rather than legislative body in reviewing applications, making decisions based on previously adopted standards. <em>Id. </em>However, it retains some discretion in deciding whether to approve an application. <em>Jones v. Town of Woodway, </em>70 Wash.2d 977, 425 P.2d 904, 908-09 (1967) (\u201c[t]he discretionary power to disapprove a plat inheres in its statutory power to approve it.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b649-12\">Washington law also demands that cities make written findings regarding whether an application comports with public health, safety, and general welfare. Wash. Rev. Code \u00a7 58.17.110(2). Public safety is a municipality\u2019s paramount concern. <em>See, e.g., Hass v. City of Kirkland, </em>78 Wash.2d 929, 481 P.2d 9, 10-11 (1971) (\u201cThere is no such thing as an inherent or vested right to imperil the health or impair the safety of the community.\u201d) (quoting <em>Seattle v. Hinckley, </em>40 Wash. 468, 82 P. 747, 748 (1905)).</p>\n<p id=\"b650-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>In 1999, C.R. Johnson\u2019s rights vested to a regulatory scheme that neither forbade nor required the City to approve an application using a water booster pump, but allowed the City to exercise its reasonable discretion on behalf of public welfare and safety. The City previously approved two plans using water booster pumps, but the \u201cdoctrine vests no right in previous favorable decisions on other applications.\u201d <em>Citizens for Responsible and Organized Planning (CROP) v. Chelan Cty., </em>105 Wash.App.753, 21 P.3d 304, 307 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b650-4\">A municipality has the latitude to consider the impact of growth on its public utility systems. <em>See </em>Wash. Rev.Code \u00a7 58.17.110(2); <em>Hass, </em>481 P.2d at 10-11. The City held public hearings, sought expert opinions, and engaged in multiple conversations regarding the feasibility of this plan. Despite split expert opinions on the wisdom of installing booster pumps, the evidence does not sufficiently demonstrate that the City overstepped its authority and impermissibly interfered with the developers\u2019 use of this property. Even if C.R. Johnson is correct in stating there was no shortage of water storage capacity, the City presented evidence of serious concerns about reliability, costs, and fire flow requirements. The City was legitimately worried about supplying water and services to new developments. It passed a moratorium on building while it addressed these issues and worked towards constructing a new reservoir. C.R. Johnson did not take any action to contest the legality of the moratorium throughout its duration. In 2000, the City implemented its Comprehensive Water Plan, clearly stating its discomfort with development at high elevations. The record does not show that the City acted outside of the bounds of its authority in denying C.R. Johnson\u2019s application or instituting a temporary moratorium on building. Accordingly, C.R. Johnson fails to create a genuine issue of material fact on whether the City violated its rights in a way that warrants compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-6\">B. Wash. Rev.Code Ch. 64.40</p>\n<p id=\"b650-7\">The district court properly granted summary judgment denying C.R. Johnson\u2019s statutory claim. Under Washington law, a property owner may recover damages from acts of a city which are \u201carbitrary, capricious, unlawful, or exceed lawful authority.\u201d Wash. Rev.Code \u00a7 64.40.020(1). Conduct that is unlawful or exceeds lawful authority is actionable if a city knew or should reasonably have known such conduct was unlawful. <em>Id. </em>This section defines an \u201cact\u201d as a \u201cfinal decision by an agency which places requirements, limitations, or conditions upon the use of real property in excess of those allowed by applicable regulations in effect on the date an application for a permit is filed.\u201d Wash. Rev.Code \u00a7 64.40.010(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b650-8\">The evidence does not create a genuine issue of fact on whether the City is liable under this section. C.R. Johnson fails to present sufficient evidence that the City\u2019s decision making was arbitrary or capricious. The City did not unlawfully deprive C. R. Johnson of its vested rights or take property without just compensation. The City acted within its discretionary powers in denying the developers\u2019 applications.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-10\">\n<em>CONCLUSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b650-11\">For the foregoing reasons, the district court properly entered summary judgment for the City of Selah.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b649-13\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
