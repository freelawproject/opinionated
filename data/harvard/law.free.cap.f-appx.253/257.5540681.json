Ward pled guilty to possession with intent to distribute cocaine base (\u201ccrack\u201d) and cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 841(a)(1), (b)(1)(C) (West 1999 &amp; Supp. 2007) (Count One), and using and carrying a firearm during and in relation to, and possessing a firearm in furtherance of, a drug trafficking crime, in violation of 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A)\u00ae (West Supp. 2007) (Count Three). The district court sentenced Ward to 101 months in prison: forty-one months on Count One and a consecutive sixty months on Count Three. Ward appeals his convictions and sentence. His attorney has filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), finding no meritorious grounds for appeal but challenging the adequacy of the Fed. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>R. Crim.P. 11 hearing and questioning .whether the sentence imposed by the district court was reasonable. Ward was advised of his right to file a pro se supplemental brief, but he did not file one. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">Because Ward did not move in the district court to withdraw his guilty plea, any error in the Rule 11 hearing is reviewed for plain error. <em>United States v. Martinez, </em>277 F.3d 517, 525 (4th Cir.2002) (discussing standard). Our careful review of the record convinces us that the district court substantially complied with the mandates of Rule 11 in accepting Ward\u2019s guilty plea and ensured that Ward entered his plea knowingly and voluntarily and that the plea was supported by an independent factual basis. <em>See United States v. DeFusco, </em>949 F.2d 114, 116, 119-20 (4th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b285-6\">Turning to Ward\u2019s sentencing challenge, in imposing a sentence after <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), a court still must calculate the applicable guideline range after making the appropriate findings of fact and consider the range in conjunction with other relevant factors under the guidelines and 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(a) (West 2000 <em>&amp; </em>Supp.2007). <em>United States v. Moreland, </em>437 F.3d 424, 432 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014U.S.-, 126 S. Ct. 2054, 164 L.Ed.2d 804 (2006). This court will affirm a <em>post-Booker </em>sentence if it \u201cis within the statutorily prescribed range and is reasonable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 433 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). \u201c[A] sentence within the proper advisory [guidelines range is presumptively reasonable.\u201d <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>445 F.3d 339, 341 (4th Cir.2006); <em>see Rita v. United States, </em>\u2014U.S.-, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2462-69, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007) (upholding application of rebuttable presumption of reasonableness to within-guidelines sentence).</p>\n<p id=\"b285-12\">The district court sentenced Ward only after considering and examining the sentencing guidelines and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, as instructed by <em>Booker. </em>Ward\u2019s 101-month sentence, consisting of forty-one months for Count One and a consecutive sixty months for Count Three, is within the properly calculated advisory guideline range and well within the statutory maximum of twenty years and life, set forth respectively in 21 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(C) for Count One and 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 924(c)(2) for Count Three. Neither Ward nor the record suggests any information so compelling as to rebut the presumption that the sentence is reasonable. We therefore conclude that the sentence is reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-13\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record for any meritorious issues and have found none. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-14\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
