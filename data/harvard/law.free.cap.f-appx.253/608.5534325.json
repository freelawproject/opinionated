Green appeals, challenging the sufficiency of the evidence in a brief filed under <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). For the reasons that follow, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-12\">Viewed in the light most favorable to the verdict, <em>see United States v. Cuevas-Arrendondo, </em>469 F.3d 712, 715 (8th Cir.2006), we conclude that the evidence amply supported Green\u2019s conviction. In part, the government presented testimony that cocaine base weighing about 15 grams, more than a personal-use quantity, was found in the pocket of a pair of pants in a closet at Green\u2019s residence. A picture of Green wearing those same pants was also found in the residence, along with plastic bags and latex gloves, but no pipes or devices used to smoke or ingest crack cocaine; and Green acknowledged that $5,500 in cash found in the closet with the pants belonged to him. <em>Cf. United States v. Bell, 477 </em>F.3d 607, 613 (8th Cir.2007) (evidence sufficient to prove possession with intent to distribute where officers found about 7 grams of crack cocaine, which testimony indicated was greater than personal-use amount, in pants pocket in room in which defendant was found unclothed; where there was no indicia of personal use of crack cocaine, such as pipes; and where defendant admitted crack was his).</p>\n<p id=\"b635-16\">Having reviewed the record independently under <em>Penson v. Ohio, </em>488 U.S. 75, 109 S.Ct. 346, 102 L.Ed.2d 300 (1988), we have found no non-frivolous issues for appeal. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the district court. We grant counsel leave to withdraw, but direct counsel to provide Green with a copy of the record as appropriate. Green\u2019s pending motions are denied.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b635-13\">. The Honorable Catherine D.
