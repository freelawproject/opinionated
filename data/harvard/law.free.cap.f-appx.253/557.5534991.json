His request for asylum and withholding of removal was denied by the immigration judge, and the Board of Immigration Appeals affirmed the decision. The immigration judge also found that Mr. Bakiu had filed a frivolous application for asylum, and the BIA also affirmed this decision. Mr. Bakiu argues that the decision to deny him asylum and the finding of frivolousness were not supported by substantial evidence. We disagree, and therefore deny his petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-10\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b584-11\">Altin Bakiu, a citizen of Albania, claimed that he had endured persecution in Albania because of his immediate family\u2019s status. Most of Mr. Bakiu\u2019s immediate family legally live in the United States. Mr. Bakiu\u2019s mother, father, and two of his siblings won the diversity lottery, which entitled them to legally live within the United States. J.A. at 128. They moved to the Detroit, Michigan area in October 2000. Petitioner did not come with them because families winning the diversity lottery are only entitled to bring children under twenty-one, and Mr. Bakiu was twenty-three. J.A. at 96. Mr. Bakiu\u2019s brother Fatjon was also left behind in Albania, although it is not clear whether it was because he was too old or because he was wheelchair-bound. J.A. at 125.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-12\">At the time his family emigrated to the United States, Mr. Bakiu was legally living and working in Italy. J.A. at 128, 98. He returned to Albania roughly in August 2001 because he lost his job in Italy. J.A. at 128, 98. He then lived with his grandmother and brother in the family home where he grew up. He alleged that upon his return to Albania he was persecuted.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b584-13\">Mr. Bakiu claimed that he has been persecuted because he has family legally living within the United States. <em>E.g., </em>J.A. at 89. He asserted that, even though he was unemployed throughout his time in Albania, individuals believed he had money because his family lived in the United <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>States. He claimed that these individuals extorted him, and if he refused to give them money, they beat him. J.A. at 89-90. Mr. Bakiu was purportedly beaten five times for refusing to pay, and purportedly paid the extortionists more than five times. J.A. at 90-91. The alleged beatings occurred \u201cin remote places, in, let\u2019s say in the woods or a forest, remote places and they us[ed] force against [him] in any, in all the ways. Until [he] accepted to give money.... [They beat him with] [different objects like steel boot, stone.\u201d J.A. at 90. He asserted that even though he reported the violence to the police, the police were either ineffectual or refused to help and the beatings continued. J.A. at 94-95, 205, 210. While his parents had initially been sending him around $300 per month, they increased that amount incrementally until it reached $600 per month, allegedly to pay the extortionists. J.A. at 121.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-5\">Mr. Bakiu states that he fled Albania to escape persecution, and on March 2, 2003 he illegally entered the United States through Miami International Airport using a fraudulent visa. J.A. at 194. Mr. Bakiu requested asylum, alleging that he was being extorted and abused in Albania because his immediate family was legally living in the United States and it was therefore presumed by his abusers that he was wealthy.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-6\">The immigration judge (IJ) denied Mr. Bakiu\u2019s petition for asylum and withholding of removal. It found that Mr. Bakiu was not credible because of inconsistencies between his testimony and his application, as well as contradictory evidence from the state department reports and the experience of his family members and others in Albania. Additionally, it found that Mr. Bakiu had not carried his burden of proof. The IJ also found that Mr. Bakiu had filed a frivolous asylum application. Mr. Bakiu asks us to reverse the IJ\u2019s determinations. Because we believe that the IJ\u2019s decision that Mr. Bakiu was incredible and filed a frivolous application was supported by substantial evidence, we deny his petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-8\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b585-9\">Mr. Bakiu asserts on petition for review that the IJ\u2019s denial of asylum was not supported by substantial evidence. He also contends that the IJ\u2019s decision that his application for asylum was frivolous is not supported by substantial evidence. We review the BIA\u2019s decision, and when the BIA adopts the IJ\u2019s decision, we review the IJ\u2019s decision directly. <em>Hasan v. Ashcroft, </em>397 F.3d 417, 419 (6th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b585-10\">Mr. Bakiu claimed asylum under the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(1) (2006). An alien claiming such relief bears the burden of proving that he is a refugee, which is defined as a person unwilling to return to his native \u201ccountry because of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1101(a)(42). The testimony of the applicant can be enough to carry his burden of proof, but it must be credible. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.13(a) (2006). If the applicant\u2019s testimony is not credible, then corroborative evidence must be provided. <em>Id. </em>A determination that the applicant is incredible and has not carried his burden of proof is reversed when \u201cany reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B) (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b585-11\">Mr. Bakiu also claimed withholding of removal under the INA, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3) (2006). An alien claiming such relief bears the burden of proving \u201cthat it is more likely than not that he or she would be persecuted on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>particular social group, or political opinion upon removal to [his or her home] country.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.16(b)(2) (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b586-4\">Mr. Bakiu was also found to have submitted a frivolous application for asylum. J.A. at 69-70. Any alien adjudged to \u201cha[ve] knowingly made a frivolous application for asylum\u201d is forever ineligible for any sort of immigration to the United States. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1158(d)(6). \u201c[A]n asylum application is frivolous if any of its material elements is deliberately fabricated.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.20 (2006). We conduct substantial evidence review of frivolousness determinations. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b586-6\">I. Denial of Asylum</p>\n<p id=\"ATs\">Mr. Bakiu argues that his testimony was credible, and that he carried his burden of proof. We evaluate each argument in turn, and find that neither has merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-7\">A. Credibility</p>\n<p id=\"b586-8\">Mr. Bakiu asserts that his testimony was credible. Credibility determinations are upheld unless \u201cany reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B). The IJ must, however, give specific reasons for its determination. <em>Sylla v. INS, </em>388 F.3d 924, 926 (6th Cir.2004). Additionally, the issues and inconsistencies that provide a basis for the determination must \u201cgo to the heart of the applicant\u2019s claim,\u201d and therefore cannot be \u201cminor and irrelevant.\u201d <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b586-9\">The IJ\u2019s determination that Mr. Bakiu was incredible is supported by substantial evidence. The main inconsistencies which supported the judgment were regarding the nature of the police department\u2019s response to Mr. Bakiu\u2019s complaint and the identity of the perpetrators. Mr. Bakiu\u2019s vague testimony also significantly supported the IJ\u2019s determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-12\">Mr. Bakiu related inconsistent stories about his interaction with the police department. In his application he alleged that when he went to the police, they \u201crefuse[d] to try and stop [his neighbors] from attacking [him].\u201d J.A. at 205. Indeed, he asserted that the extortionists had the \u201ctacit support of the police.\u201d J.A. at 210. In his testimony at the removal proceedings, however, Mr. Bakiu stated that he reported the extortion and beatings to the police, the police stated that they were \u201cgoing to fix that problem,\u201d which he took to mean that the police were \u201cgoing to help,\u201d and that the police never refused to help him. J.A. at 91-95. He further intimated that the reason he believed the police could not protect him was because he was beaten the day after he made the report, and therefore he believed that the police were ineffectual. J.A. at 91, 94. He did not, however, pursue his initial police report nor did he make an additional complaint about the subsequent beating. J.A. at 94.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-13\">This is an inconsistency striking at \u201cthe heart of the applicant\u2019s claim.\u201d An applicant has to prove that he or she is \u201cunable or unwilling to avail himself or herself of the protection of\u2019 the country from which the applicant has fled. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42) (2006). It matters greatly, therefore, whether the police truly could not protect Mr. Bakiu, or whether the police were complicit in the alleged persecution. Refusing to help and being com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>plicit in persecution is much different than receiving one report and no further reports or requests for help from the complaining party. Indeed, Mr. Bakiu\u2019s testimony is not only inconsistent with his application, it likely supports a finding that Mr. Bakiu has not proven that the police are unable or unwilling to help him with the alleged persecution and therefore has not established his eligibility for asylum.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-5\">Mr. Bakiu\u2019s testimony at the removal hearing about the identity of his persecutors was also inconsistent with his asylum application. He repeatedly emphasized in his asylum application that his neighbors were extorting and beating him. J.A. at 210 (identifying his neighbors as those who caused him harm); J.A. at 210 (\u201cI believe that my neighbors think that since my family is in America, they must be rich and since I was alone, I was also vulnerable because of the police refusal to protect me from them.\u201d); J.A. at 205 (\u201cI am afraid of my neighbors, they have been the culprits.\u201d); J.A. at 235 (\u201cHe said that people in his neighborhood knew that his parents were living in the United States and they wanted money from him for this reason.\u201d). While testifying, however, Mr. Bakiu stated the opposite; Mr. Bakiu insisted that his extortionists were not his neighbors and were instead individuals unknown to him. J.A. at 102 (\u201cThey\u2019re unknown people from me.... I don\u2019t know their names, first names, last names.\u201d); J.A. at 103 (stating that the attackers were not his neighbors). When given a chance to explain the discrepancy, Mr. Bakiu only stated that it could \u201cmaybe\u201d be explained by the fact that he was not asked details in his application and prior interview or that \u201cmaybe\u201d he was \u201ca little bit scared\u201d and therefore did not \u201cconcentrate[ ] [o]n all of the questions.\u201d J.A. at 115.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-6\">This inconsistency similarly strikes at \u201cthe heart of the applicant\u2019s claim.\u201d An applicant has to prove that the persecution was \u201con account of\u2019 one of the protected grounds in the INA. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.13(b)(1) (2006). \u201c[T]he statute[, therefore,] makes motive critical, [so] he must provide <em>some </em>evidence of it, direct or circumstantial.\u201d <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 483, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992) (emphasis in original). Mr. Bakiu claimed that he was persecuted because he was presumed wealthy due to his immediate family members legally living within the United States. The identity of his persecutors, therefore, is circumstantial evidence as to whether or not they extorted and beat him because of his membership in this alleged particular social group. The fact that the extortionists were his neighbors would better support his claim; they would at least be aware that Mr. Bakiu\u2019s family lived in the United States. When Mr. Bakiu changed his story to his persecutors being unknown to him, his asylum claim was substantially weakened. How did he know that these unknown individuals were extorting him because of the status of his family? He testified that the attackers did know his family was in the United States, J.A. at 101, but he did not specify how he knew that the attackers knew the location of his family, and he did not provide much of an explanation for how the unknown attackers gained such information. J.A. at 101-02 (\u201cThey were individuals that knew that my family was in the United States? They sending some other individuals to, that I, unknown individuals that ask me for what they want.... I don\u2019t know [who they were]. They\u2019re unknown people from me.... I don\u2019t know their names, first name, last names.\u201d); J.A. at 103 (\u201cMaybe other people that knew me they, they, these guys took the information from the people that know me and they knew that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>my parents were in the United States so that\u2019s why they\u2019re asking me (indiscernible) \u2014 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b588-4\">It could be that Mr. Bakiu was using two different definitions of \u201cneighbor.\u201d On his application, Mr. Bakiu could have meant that his attackers were his \u201cneighbors\u201d because the individuals were aware that his family lived in the United States and had found out that he went to the police regarding the first attack. \u201cNeighbor\u201d in such a context would mean that it was a person in Mr. Bakiu\u2019s general vicinity, not necessarily someone he knew. In his testimony, then, Mr. Bakiu could have resisted the word \u201cneighbor\u201d because the questioners were focusing on whether Mr. Bakiu knew his attackers, which suggests that the questioner believes a \u201cneighbor\u201d to be someone Mr. Bakiu would know. While this is a reasonable explanation of the discrepancy, we are not compelled by the record to conclude that the IJ was incorrect in not so finding; the IJ\u2019s decision that Mr. Bakiu was using the word \u201cneighbor\u201d in the same manner, and that therefore his application was inconsistent with his testimony, was supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-5\">Mr. Bakiu\u2019s very vague testimony also greatly supports the IJ\u2019s finding that Mr. Bakiu lacked credibility. An applicant must provide \u201c \u2018credible, direct, and <em>specific </em>evidence\u2019 \u201d of past persecution or of the basis for the applicant\u2019s fear of future persecution. <em>Klawitter v. INS, </em>970 F.2d 149, 153 (6th Cir.1992) (quoting <em>Rodriguez-Rivera v. INS, </em>848 F.2d 998, 1002 (9th Cir.1988) (per curiam)) (emphasis added). Mr. Bakiu first testified that the extortionists used \u201cviolence\u201d against him. J.A. at 89-90. When asked what sorts of violence, he stated that it was \u201cphysical violence.\u201d J.A. at 90. When asked to be more specific, he stated: \u201cThey are taking me [to] remote places, let\u2019s say [to] the woods or a forest, remote places and they us[ed] force against me in any, in all the ways.\u201d J.A. at 90. This was followed by him being asked if he was beaten, and Mr. Bakiu answering in the affirmative. When asked what he was beaten with, he said \u201cDifferent objects like steel boot, stone.\u201d J.A. at 90. He was then asked how many times he was beaten, and he replied \u201cAnytime that I[ ] refus[ed] to give money.\u201d When asked to be more specific, he said that he \u201cremember[s] five times\u201d and that he did not refuse to pay the extortionists after the fifth beating. When asked how many times he had paid his persecutors prior to fleeing the country, he stated that he \u201cpaid more than five times.\u201d J.A. at 90-91.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-7\">This sort of testimony is very vague and lacking in detail, and it therefore permits the IJ to draw an inference of incredibility. Despite repeatedly being asked to elaborate, Mr. Bakiu never described basic parts of his story which would be easy to relate if the events had actually occurred. For instance, he never described how many individuals were extorting him, how old the individuals were, whether or not it was the same group of people each time, how he knew that the extortionists were aware his family was in the United States, whether he would give the extortionists all the money his parents sent or just partial sums, or whether he required medical treatment or sustained any sort of injury from being beaten when he refused to pay. There are numerous other details that could have made his story more credible. <em>Cf. Sylla, </em>388 F.3d at 928-29. Based on Mr. Bakiu\u2019s testimonial vagueness, his inconsistent statements regarding the identity of his attackers, as well as his inconsistent statements regarding the reaction of the police, the IJ\u2019s finding that Mr. Bakiu was incredible was supported by substantial evidence; the record does not compel us to conclude that Mr. Bakiu was credible.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>B. Burden of Proof</p>\n<p id=\"b589-5\">Mr. Bakiu next argues that the IJ erred in denying his claim for asylum because he carried his burden of proof. We review the IJ\u2019s decision for substantial evidence. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B) (2006). The IJ\u2019s decision here is supported by substantial evidence because Mr. Bakiu\u2019s testimony was central to establishing his claim, and the IJ found that testimony incredible.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-6\">C. Withholding of Removal</p>\n<p id=\"b589-7\">Mr. Bakiu also petitioned for withholding of removal under the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3) (2006). Because Mr. Bakiu failed to establish his eligibility for asylum, \u201cit therefore follows that he cannot satisfy the more stringent standard for withholding of [removal].\u201d <em>See Koliada v. INS, </em>259 F.3d 482, 489 (6th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b589-9\">II. Frivolousness of the Application</p>\n<p id=\"b589-10\">We review an IJ\u2019s determination that an asylum application was frivolous for substantial evidence. <em>Sterkaj v. Gonzales, </em>439 F.3d 273, 278 (6th Cir.2006). This means upholding the IJ\u2019s determination unless \u201cany reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B) (2006). \u201c[A]n asylum application is frivolous if any of its material elements is deliberately fabricated.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.20 (2006). It must further be found that the \u201calien [ ] knowingly made [the] frivolous application for asylum,\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(d)(6) (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b589-11\">While it is a close question, the IJ\u2019s determination that Mr. Bakiu\u2019s asylum application was frivolous was supported by substantial evidence. The IJ believed that Mr. Bakiu fabricated a story about being extorted because he wanted to join his family in the United States. JA. at 66. The IJ relied on the State Department\u2019s Profile of Asylum Claims, which described how many Albanians fabricate stories of persecution as a means to legally immigrate to join families already living within the United States. J.A. at 191. The IJ also relied on the fact that Mr. Bakiu was inconsistent about crucial details and very vague on other details that went to the heart of his application. Lastly, the IJ believed it likely that Mr. Bakiu deliberately falsified information because Mr. Bakiu failed to apply for asylum in Italy and France, two countries through which he traveled prior to entering the United States. J.A. at 55. While this is not the strongest evidence from which the IJ could infer a \u201cdeliberate\u201d and \u201cknowing[ ]\u201d falsification, we are not compelled by the record to conclude the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-13\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b589-14\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b584-9\">. Mr. Bakiu exhibited confusion regarding this timeline. While Mr. Bakiu alleged that his problems began \"six months after [his] family left,\u201d J.A. at 89, which would have been May 2001, this is inconsistent with his mother's testimony, which placed him working in Italy until August 2001, J.A. at 128. Mr. Bakiu made other ambiguous statements regarding this timeline. Mr. Bakiu's asylum application stated that he returned to Albania in January 2000, J.A. at 204, and he stated in the removal proceedings that he lived in Italy \"until 2000, 2001,\u201d J.A. at 98. He also stated in the removal proceedings, however, that he left Albania in February 2003 and had lived in Albania for two years prior to that time, which means he lived in Albania beginning roughly in February 2001.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b586-10\">.
