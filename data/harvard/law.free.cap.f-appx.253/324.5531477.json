Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). Brown was convicted by a jury of conspiracy under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (\u201cRICO\u201d), in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1962(d) (2000), and conspiracy to distribute and possess with intent to distribute cocaine base, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846 (2000). Initially, he received a 324-month sentence of imprisonment. Brown appealed his convictions and sentence. <em>See United States v. Batts, </em>171 Fed.Appx. 977 (4th Cir.) (unpublished), <em>cert. denied, -U</em>.S.-, 127 S.Ct. 160, 166 L.Ed.2d 113 (2006). We affirmed his convictions, but reversed his sentence and remanded to the district court for resentencing under the advisory guidelines in light of <em>Booker. </em>Brown appeals from resentencing, challenging the district court\u2019s application of the enhancement under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841 (2000) to his sentence. Finding no reversible error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>On remand, Brown challenged for the first time the application of the armed career criminal sentencing enhancement under \u00a7 841 to his sentence. Brown objected to the use of the prior conviction listed in the Government\u2019s 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851 (2000) notice as a predicate offense, arguing it was invalid for purposes of the enhancement. Brown contended the use of the prior conviction was improper because the prior offense was related to his current conspiracy conviction and his guilty plea to the prior conviction was involuntary. The district court overruled Brown\u2019s objection and resentenced him to 240 months\u2019 imprisonment-the alternate sentence it had announced at the original sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">Brown first argues on appeal that the district court erred in applying the \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A) enhancement to his sentence because the factual basis for the prior conviction was introduced at trial as evidence in the Government\u2019s case and was thus related to the conspiracy. We find the district court did not err in enhancing Brown\u2019s sentence because a conviction occurring during the course of a conspiracy can form the basis for a sentencing enhancement in a prosecution of the conspiracy. <em>See United States v. Howard, </em>115 F.3d 1151, 1158 (4th Cir.1997). The Government presented substantial evidence that Brown engaged in the conspiracy even after his February 2000 conviction became final. Brown\u2019s continued participation in the conspiracy after his prior drug conviction \u201cis precisely the type of recidivism to which section 841 is addressed.\u201d <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">Brown next argues the prior conviction used to enhance his sentence was unconstitutional because his guilty plea on the prior conviction was involuntary. We find the record shows Brown\u2019s guilty plea was knowing and voluntary, and thus was not unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-7\">Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-8\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
