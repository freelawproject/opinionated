This Court granted a certificate of appealability on the single issue of Martinez\u2019s <em>Batson </em>claim. We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-14\">Martinez argues that the Appellate Division unreasonably applied clearly established Supreme Court precedent when it denied his claim under <em>Batson v. Kentucky, </em>476 U.S. 79, 106 S.Ct. 1712, 90 L.Ed.2d 69 (1986), as interpreted in <em>People v. Bolling, </em>79 N.Y.2d 317, 582 N.Y.S.2d 950, 591 N.E.2d 1136 (1992), concluding that he failed to establish a prima facie case of discrimination. <em>See Harris v. Kuhlmann, </em>346 F.3d 330, 344 (2d Cir.2003) (explaining that, under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (AEDPA), when the state court correctly identifies the governing legal principle, as here, our review is limited to the \u201cunreasonable application\u201d prong of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1)); <em>see also People v. Gonzalez, </em>251 A.D.2d 51, 53, 673 N.Y.S.2d 669 (1st Dep\u2019t 1998). Martinez asserts that he made out a prima facie case of discrimination based on statistics alone when the prosecution, in exercising fourteen peremptory strikes against a panel of forty potential jurors, struck four out of five black members of the venire. We conclude that the state court did not act unreasonably in discounting one of the peremptory challenges based on its determination that the prosecution gave a reasonable race-neutral explanation for striking that juror in a previous for cause challenge. While statistics alone may establish a prima facie case in certain circumstances, <em>Overton v. Newton, </em>295 F.3d 270, 278 (2d Cir.2002), the state court did not unreasonably apply federal law in concluding that the prosecution\u2019s striking three of four prospective black jurors was not a sufficient pattern of strikes to draw <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>an inference of discrimination, at least not at that early point in the jury selection process, <em>see id. </em>at 279.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
