Smith appeals his sentence for conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute cocaine and marijuana, possession of a firearm by a convicted felon, and possession with intent to distribute marijuana and cocaine that was imposed after remand in his first appeal, <em>United States v. Allen, 302 </em>F.3d 1260 (11th Cir.2002). Allen, in his third appeal, appeals his sentence for conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute cocaine and marijuana and possession of cocaine with the intent to distribute following our remand to the district court for resentencing in light of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b869-10\">I. Corey Smith</p>\n<p id=\"b869-11\">First, Smith argues that the district court\u2019s application of the \u201cremedial\u201d holding of <em>Booker </em>violated the Ex Post Facto Clause of the Constitution. Smith argues, however, that he should receive the benefit of the \u201cconstitutional\u201d <em>Booker- </em>holding that any facts used to sentence him beyond the statutory maximum must be proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-14\">We have rejected the idea that a court may splice <em>Booker\u2019s </em>Sixth Amendment holding from the remedial holding and apply only paid of <em>Booker </em>retroactively. <em>See United States v. Duncan, </em>400 F.3d 1297, 1303-04 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>546 U.S. 940, 126 S.Ct. 432, 163 L.Ed.2d 329 (2005). Furthermore, we rejected the argument that the application of the <em>Booker </em>remedial holding would violate the Ex Post Facto Clause because it would effectively increase the sentence authorized by the jury verdict from the guideline range to the statutory maximum. <em>Id. </em>at 1307-08. There is no ex post facto violation in the retroactive application of the remedial <em>Booker </em>holding \u201cwhere, at the time the defendant committed the offense, the United States Code and the guidelines advised the defendant of the statutory maximum sentence and \u2018that a judge would engage in fact-finding to determine his sentence and could impose up to\u2019 the statutory maximum sentence.\u201d <em>United States v. Martinez, </em>434 F.3d 1318, 1323-24 (11th Cir.2006) (quoting <em>Duncan, </em>400 F.3d at 1307).</p>\n<p id=\"b869-15\">Smith also asserts that the district court violated the Fifth Amendment Indictment Clause by applying sentencing enhancements not found by the grand jury. We have rejected this argument, holding that there is no Fifth Amendment right under <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), or <em>Booker </em>to have all sentence-enhancing facts found by a grand jury and charged in the indictment. <em>See United States v. Thomas, </em>446 F.3d 1348, 1355 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b869-16\">Smith\u2019s next contention is that the district court erred by applying a statutory maximum of forty years to his conviction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"844\">*844</page-number>for Count 11 (possession with the intent to distribute cocaine) when it should have applied a twenty-year statutory minimum because the indictment did not allege a quantity of cocaine. In <em>Allen, </em>we carefully considered this argument and concluded that the evidence of the quantity was \u201coverwhelming\u201d and \u201cessentially uncontroverted\u201d so as to justify a maximum sentence beyond twenty years. 302 F.3d at 1279. Therefore, the district court properly rejected this argument, finding that the issue had already been decided by this court, and further holding, in accordance with <em>United States v. Nealy, </em>232 F.3d 825, 829 (11th Cir.2000), that because the evidence of drug quantity was clear and uncontroverted, any error under <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-4\">Smith argues that the district court erred in applying a career offender enhancement to his sentence because the \u201cprior conviction exception\u201d to <em>Booker </em>is \u201cgravely wounded.\u201d While recent decisions \u201cmay arguably cast doubt on the future prospects of Almendarez-Torres\u2019s holding regarding prior convictions, the Supreme Court has not explicitly overruled <em>Almendarez-Torres [v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998)].\u201d <em>United States v. Camacho-Ibarquen, </em>410 F.3d 1307, 1316 n. 3 (11th Cir.2005). Therefore, the use of Smith\u2019s prior convictions to enhance his sentence under USSG. \u00a7 4B1.1 did not violate his constitutional rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-5\">Smith\u2019s argument that his 1994 firearm conviction was related to the instant conspiracy, and thus cannot be used to define him as a career offender under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1, is similarly without merit. At sentencing, Smith challenged the 1994 concealed weapon charge as related to the instant offense. However, he did not object to the probation officer\u2019s accounting of the facts of these offenses, only that the conviction was related to the John Doe conspiracy. The undisputed facts show that the offense involved an individual not involved in the John Doe conspiracy, the offense did not occur near a known drug hole, the offense occurred four years prior to the John Doe firearm offenses, and the arrest was the result of a separate investigation of an armed robbery offense. The district court did not err in determining that the offense should be counted toward Smith\u2019s career offender status.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-7\">Smith also contends that the district court\u2019s sixty-year sentence was unreasonable. We review post <em>-Booker </em>sentences for reasonableness. <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 785 (11th Cir.2005). Under <em>Booker, </em>a sentencing court is still obligated to correctly calculate a defendant\u2019s Guidelines range. <em>United States v. Crawford, </em>407 F.3d 1174, 1178 (11th Cir.2005). The district court must also consider the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). <em>Id. </em>The party challenging the sentence bears the burden of establishing unreasonableness in light of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and the record below. <em>Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 788.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-8\">Upon review of the records and the briefs, we find no reversible error. The district court\u2019s sentence was reasonable, given its detailed rationale and the nature and circumstances of the offense. First, the district court correctly calculated Smith\u2019s Guidelines range. While the district court may have at first calculated a \u201cconstitutional guidelines\u201d range and excluded most enhancements, it later calculated the advisory range properly, including all enhancements that it found by a preponderance of the evidence. Second, the district court explained that its decision to sentence Smith to the statutory maximum for each conviction was based on the large quantity of drugs that Smith was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"845\">*845</page-number>responsible for, his leadership role in the offense, and for his possession of a firearm. Further, the district court explicitly considered each \u00a7 8553(a) factor and opined that Smith committed egregious offenses and had a violent criminal history, so significant punishment was necessary to provide deterrence and protect the public. The district court\u2019s justification for Smith\u2019s sentence shows that it was reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-5\">Smith argues for the first time on appeal that the district court violated his \u201canti-shuttling\u201d rights under the Interstate Agreement on Detainers (\u201cIAD\u201d), 18 U.S.C.App. 2, \u00a7 2, by resentencing him while his state criminal proceedings were pending. At the sentencing hearing, Smith\u2019s counsel stated his assumption that Smith\u2019s state criminal proceedings were complete and that the resentencing would not violate the anti-shuttling law. Smith failed to inform the court of his new pending state charge. Therefore, he waived the protections of the IAD. <em>See United States v. Scallion, </em>548 F.2d 1168, 1174 (5th Cir.1977) (finding Defendant had waived any violation of the IAD by failing to present the issue to the district court).</p>\n<p id=\"b871-6\">II. Antonio Allen</p>\n<p id=\"b871-7\">Allen argues that the district court violated the law of the case doctrine by not following our last opinion in this case, <em>United States v. Allen, </em>142 Fed.Appx. 410 (11th <em>Cir.2005)(\"Allen III\u201d).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b871-8\">\u201cThe law of the case doctrine, self-imposed by the courts, operates to create efficiency, finality and obedience within the judicial system.\u201d <em>United States v. Tamayo, </em>80 F.3d 1514, 1520 (11th Cir.1996). \u201cAn appellate decision binds all subsequent proceedings in the same case not only as to explicit rulings, but also as to issues decided necessarily by implication on the prior appeal.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Accordingly, \u201c[a] district court when acting under an appellate court\u2019s mandate, cannot vary it, or examine it for any other purpose than execution; or give any other or further relief; or review it, even for apparent error, upon a matter decided on appeal; or intermeddle with it, further than to settle so much as has been remanded.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal citations and quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b871-10\">Allen seizes upon one sentence from <em>Allen III </em>\u2014 \u201cthe district court cannot enhance Allen\u2019s sentence for his involvement with cocaine base\u201d \u2014 to support his argument that the district court could not include cocaine base in its Guidelines calculation. However, in <em>Allen III, </em>we repeatedly stated that the district court\u2019s error was that it made factual findings regarding the type of cocaine under a mandatory, not advisory, Guidelines scheme. Here, the district court sentenced Allen under an advisory Guidelines standard and did not exceed the statutory maximum sentence based upon the quantity of cocaine powder.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-11\">Allen also maintains that his 188-months\u2019 sentence was unreasonable. As we noted above, we review <em>post-Booker </em>sentences for reasonableness. <em>Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 785. We conclude that the district court\u2019s sentence was reasonable. The district court correctly calculated that Allen was responsible for an amount of cocaine that created a base offense level of thirty-two and then enhanced his sentence by two levels for possession of a firearm. With a criminal history category of I, the district court determined that Allen\u2019s Guidelines range was 151 to 188 months\u2019 imprisonment. The district court then sentenced Allen to 188 months, a sentence at the top of the Guidelines range. In support, the district court twice stated that it believed that Allen\u2019s previous 235-month sentence was reasonable given his role in the offense, but still sentenced him within the Guidelines range. These comments <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"846\">*846</page-number>implicate a number of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, such as the nature of the offense and the need to provide just punishment, and</p>\n<p id=\"b872-4\">Allen fails to show why his within-range sentence is unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
