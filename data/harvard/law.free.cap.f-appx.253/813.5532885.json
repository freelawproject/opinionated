After review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"814\">*814</page-number>I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b840-4\">A. Offense Conduct</p>\n<p id=\"b840-5\">Potts and two co-defendants, Freddie J. Newton and Travis Robinson, were charged in a multi-count indictment alleging a fraud scheme in which the defendants purchased cellular phones and service using counterfeit checks and then resold them for cash on the street. Potts was charged with seven counts of mail fraud and one count of conspiracy to commit mail fraud. Potts\u2019s co-defendants pled guilty. Newton received a 16-month sentence. Robinson received an 18-month sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-6\">Potts pled not guilty and proceeded to trial. A jury convicted Potts on the conspiracy count, but acquitted him on the substantive mail fraud counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-7\">According to the Presentence Investigation Report (\u201cPSI\u201d), in April 2003, Potts\u2019s co-defendants, Newton and Robinson, formed Federal Auditing Express ostensibly to provide credit rebuilding services for people with poor credit.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> However, Robinson and Newton used the company to purchase, with counterfeit checks, cellular phones and service and then resell them on the street for $200 each plus a monthly usage fee. Newton and Robinson began the scheme by ordering 50 phones from Nextel and mailing counterfeit checks to Nextel as payment.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-8\">Newton and Robinson then approached Potts to sell him a phone and told him of the scheme. Potts offered to help with sales and to organize the operation and later joined the operation. Potts became the vice president of operations.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-9\">Two weeks after Potts joined Federal Auditing Express, the defendants ordered and sold another 50 phones from Nextel. Three weeks later, the defendants ordered a third set of 50 phones from Nextel, for a total of 150 Nextel phones. After four months, Nextel discontinued service, and defendants ordered phones from T-Mobile. As each cell phone company discontinued service, defendants ordered phones from another cell phone company.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-13\">The three co-defendants divided the profits among themselves. During the course of the entire scheme, these phones were ordered and paid for with counterfeit cheeks: 150 phones from Nextel for a loss of $82,433.29, 150 phones from T-Mobile for a loss of $26,183.31, between 200 and 250 phones from Verizon for a loss of $126,128.76, and 50 phones from Sprint PCS for a loss of $14,345.57. In addition, Newton leased office furniture for Federal Auditing Express from Office Suites Plus and paid $30,503.00 using a counterfeit check. The total loss attributable to the scheme was $279,593.93.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The scheme continued for four months until Potts and Robinson had a disagreement with Newton and left the company.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-14\">B. PSI</p>\n<p id=\"b840-15\">The PSI recommended a total offense level of 18, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(l)(G), because the loss was more than $200,000 but less than $400,000. With Potts\u2019s criminal history category I, the PSI calculated an advisory guidelines range of 27 to 33 months. The PSI also stated that Potts was fully informed of the scheme and that neither an aggravating nor a mitigating role adjustment was warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"815\">*815</page-number>Potts filed a written objection limited to the factual allegations regarding the offense conduct. Specifically, Potts\u2019s objection did not dispute that he worked at Federal Auditing Express, that the phone orders were made at the times noted in the PSI, that he participated in phone orders, that Newton and Robinson were involved in the fraud scheme in issue or that the actual losses in issue occurred in the amounts shown in the PSI. <em>See United States v. Shelton, </em>400 F.3d 1325, 1330 (11th Cir.2005) (explaining that facts in the PSI that are not disputed by the defendant are deemed admitted). Rather, Potts\u2019s objection maintained his innocence, claimed that he was unaware of the fraud scheme during the time he worked at Federal Auditing Express and denied that Newton and Robinson told him of the scheme. Potts did not object to the PSI\u2019s guidelines calculations in paragraphs 11-28 and 52-61.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-5\">C. Sentencing Hearing</p>\n<p id=\"b841-6\">At the sentencing hearing, the district court overruled Potts\u2019s objections to the factual allegations in the PSI, noting that they attacked Potts\u2019s conviction and did not affect the guidelines calculations. The district court found that the advisory guidelines calculations resulted in a range of 27 to 33 months and asked Potts what sentence it should impose.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-7\">Potts\u2019s counsel argued for a probation sentence, emphasizing: (1) Potts\u2019s service in the Gulf War; (2) his two young children; (3) his involvement in the community and his church; (4) character letters; (5) his lack of a criminal history; and (6) his co-defendants\u2019 18- and 16-month sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-8\">Then Potts\u2019s counsel pointed out that Potts was with Federal Auditing Express for only two months. In response, the district court stated, \u201cYeah. I\u2019m kind of surprised, but you didn\u2019t seek a minor role adjustment.\u201d Potts\u2019s counsel stated that he \u201cthought it was pretty obvious that it was a minor role\u201d and asked the district court for probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-10\">The district court stated that, \u201cit\u2019s a tough argument to ask me to apply the factors without regard to the guidelines in this case, because with a fraud of this size, I don\u2019t think one could say rationally that a 27-month sentence is an unreasonable sentence even for a first offender.\u201d The district court opined that \u201cmaybe there is an argument here that he was a minor participant. He wasn\u2019t in on the scheme the entire time and the others do seem to have been more deeply involved,\u201d and asked for the government\u2019s position.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-11\">The government opposed a minor role reduction, noting that although Potts joined the fraud conspiracy after it had been in operation for a month, the conspiracy lasted four or five months. The government stressed that Potts took \u201cmajor steps\u201d in the conspiracy, including becoming the \u201cpoint of contact\u201d with the telephone companies, meeting phone company representatives and lying to them about the number of employees at Federal Auditing Express and signing contracts. In reply, Potts argued that he \u201cjust ordered telephones,\u201d \u201chad nothing to do with the checks\u201d and was not involved in setting up the scheme.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-12\">Potts again emphasized his co-defendants\u2019 16- and 18-month sentences. The government responded that the co-defendants had pled guilty and had received reductions for acceptance of responsibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-13\">Potts\u2019s counsel also argued that the fraud scheme was set up and started by Potts\u2019 co-defendants before Potts joined the conspiracy and that thus Potts was not responsible for the entire amount of the loss. The government responded that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"816\">*816</page-number>Potts became involved in the scheme after the first set of phones was ordered, which the PSI shows was the first 50-phone Nextel order. Potts did not object to the accuracy of the government\u2019s representation.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-4\">The district court then heard from Potts and his wife. The district court found that Potts\u2019s case was \u201cserious\u201d and involved a \u201cbig loss,\u201d and that a 27-month sentence was not unreasonable. The district court noted the need to deter criminal conduct. The district court concluded that, although Potts had no prior criminal record, it could not say \u201cthat the factors that favor a more lenient sentence in this case outweigh the factors that favor a guideline sentence.\u201d Stating that it had considered the statements of the parties, the PSI, the advisory guidelines calculations and the statutory factors, the district court imposed a 27-month sentence. When the district court asked for objections, Potts made none.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-5\">This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-6\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b842-7\">On appeal, Potts argues that he should have received a minor role reduction pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-8\">Under \u00a7 3B1.2, if a defendant was a minor participant in the criminal activity, then the offense level is decreased by two levels. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B 1.2(b). A minor participant is a defendant \u201cwho is less culpable than most other participants, but whose role could not be described as minimal.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2 cmt. n. 5. A defendant who seeks an adjustment under \u00a7 3B1.2 bears the burden of proving his mitigated role in the offense by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>United States v. De Varon, </em>175 F.3d 930, 939 (11th Cir. 1999). When determining the defendant\u2019s role in the offense, the district court\u2019s consideration is guided by two principles: (1) the court must compare the defendant\u2019s role in the offense with the relevant conduct attributed to him in calculating his offense level; and (2) the court may compare the defendant\u2019s conduct to that of other participants involved in the offense. <em>Id. </em>at 940-45.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-13\">Citing <em>De Var\u00f3n, </em>Potts argues that he is entitled to a minor role reduction because he was held responsible for the full amount of loss resulting from the conspiracy, including losses incurred before he joined the conspiracy. Under <em>De Var\u00f3n, </em>in determining Potts\u2019s role, we look to the conduct on which his offense level is founded. Here, Potts\u2019s offense level of 18 is founded on the total conspiracy in this case, which involved 550 to 600 phones bought with counterfeit checks at a total estimated loss of $279,593.93.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-14\">The problem for Potts is the evidence showed that he joined the conspiracy after the first Nextel order of 50 phones and that this Nextel order represents only a minor part (approximately $27,477.76<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>) of the total $279,593.93 loss. Thus, Potts participated in at least ninety percent of the fraudulent phone orders and ninety percent of the loss. In other words, Potts\u2019s actual conduct and relevant conduct were not materially different. Moreover, the loss of $27,477.76 from the first Nextel order did not affect Potts\u2019s offense level calculation. Under \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(l)(G), Potts\u2019s total offense level of 18 was based on an amount of loss exceeding $200,000. Even deducting the $27,477.76 loss amount from the total loss of $279,593.93, the loss attributable directly to Potts is $252,116.17. Thus, Potts\u2019s total offense <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"817\">*817</page-number>level remains the same even if the first Nextel order is deducted from his loss calculation.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b843-5\">Furthermore, Potts\u2019s role in the overall conspiracy was anything but minor. Potts was one of three partners in the scheme and shared in the proceeds. As vice president of operations, Potts was the \u201ccontact person\u201d with the phone companies, who placed orders, signed contracts and, when necessary, lied to phone company representatives to keep the scheme going. Potts presented over $100,000 in bad checks while knowing Federal Auditing Express had no bank account. Potts\u2019s role, although perhaps different from that of his co-defendants, was no less important to the continued success of the scheme. Even assuming <em>arguendo </em>that Potts was less culpable than his two co-defendants (the only other discernable participants), he was not a minor participant. <em>De Varon, </em>175 F.3d at 944 (\u201cThe fact that a defendant\u2019s role may be less than that of other participants engaged in the relevant conduct may not be dispositive of role in the offense, since it is possible that none are minor or minimal participants.\u201d).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b843-10\">Because the record amply shows that Potts was more than a minor participant in the conspiracy, the district court did not err, plainly or otherwise, in not granting Potts a minor role reduction under \u00a7 3B1.2(b).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b843-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b840-10\">. Newton was the president of Federal Auditing Express, and Robinson was the chief executive officer.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b840-16\">. Potts did not object to the PSI's calculation of the amount of loss during the entire conspiracy.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b842-9\">. The PSI indicated that, in toto, defendants ordered 150 phones from Nextel for a loss of $82,433.29. Thus, one third of Nextel\u2019s $82,433.29 in losses \u2014 or $27,477.76 \u2014 is fairly attributable to the first Nextel order of 50 phones.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b843-6\">. For the first time on appeal, Potts argues that the government\u2019s representation at sentencing that Potts joined the conspiracy after the first phone order was inconsistent with the evidence presented at trial. The government's representation, however, is consistent with the PSI, which stated in paragraph 5 that the second 50-phone Nextel order was placed by Federal Auditing Express two weeks after Potts was hired. In any event, as the government notes, there was trial evidence to support the government\u2019s representation. For example, Jeremy Latimer, the Nextel sales representative assigned to Federal Auditing Express, testified that Newton and Robinson placed the first order of 50 phones, but that around the time of the second order, Newton introduced him to Potts and explained that Potts would be handling the phone orders.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b843-7\">. Potts complains that the district court failed to rule explicitly on the minor-role-reduction issue. A district court\u2019s failure to make an explicit determination does not require remand if the record clearly supports the district court's implicit determination. <em>See United States v. Villarino, </em>930 F.2d 1527, 1528-29 (11th Cir.1991); <em>see also United States v. Taylor, </em>88 F.3d 938, 944 (11th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b843-14\">Here, after entertaining extensive argument from both parties on this issue, the district court concluded that Potts\u2019s case was serious and that a 27-month sentence was appropriate. By imposing a sentence at the low end of the advisory guidelines range calculated in the PSI, which clearly did not include a minor role reduction, the district court implicitly denied Potts a minor role reduction. That implicit determination is amply supported by the record. Therefore, remand is not required.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b843-15\">. Although we ordinarily review for clear error a district court\u2019s determination of a defendant\u2019s role in the offense, <em>De Varon, </em>175 F.3d at 937, the government urges us to apply plain error review because Potts did not request a minor role reduction or object to the district court\u2019s refusal to give him one. For the reasons discussed above, Potts has failed to show reversible error under either standard of review and thus it is unnecessary to resolve the applicable standard of review.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
