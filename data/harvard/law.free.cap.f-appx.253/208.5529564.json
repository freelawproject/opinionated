He was sentenced to seventy-five months imprisonment, followed by a four-year term of supervised release. On appeal, Carson contends that the District Court erred at sentencing by refusing to consider the Sentencing Commission\u2019s findings regarding the 100:1 disparity in the Guidelines sentencing ranges for crack cocaine and powder cocaine during its analysis of the relevant sentencing factors pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">We review the District Court\u2019s sentence for reasonableness. The record here reflects that the District Court arrived at its decision after it gave \u201cmeaningful consideration\u201d to the relevant \u00a7 3553(a) factors. At the sentencing hearing, the District Court made the following findings: (1) Carson \u201chad a long history of assaultive behavior and drug-related criminal activity, largely the possession of drugs,\u201d (2) the crime was \u201cserious,\u201d and (3) Carson was an \u201cintegral cog in this crime.\u201d The District Court also took into account Carson\u2019s \u201csignificant\u201d and \u201cextensive\u201d criminal history. In the end, after recognizing that Carson was subject to a mandatory minimum sentence of five years and a maximum of forty, the District Court found that a sentence of seventy-five months (6.25 years) to be a reasonable sentence, having taken into account the guideline provisions, the guideline range in this case and the other \u00a7 3553(a) factors. We see no basis for disturbing this sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-7\">The District Court\u2019s sentencing methodology comports with requirements of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). The District Court understood its authority to impose a non-guidelines sentence, but chose not to do so. A district court is \u201cunder no obligation to impose a sentence below the applicable Guidelines range solely on the basis of the crack/powder cocaine differential.\u201d <em>United States v. Gunter, </em>462 F.3d 237, 249 (3d Cir.2006). Here, the District Court specifically considered the crack/powder cocaine ratio, but found\u2014 given its analysis of the relevant \u00a7 3553(a) factors \u2014 that \u201cI have considered the defendant\u2019s argument through counsel that I should take into account the differential with respect to crack cocaine and powder cocaine. I have done that and I have concluded that whether the differential is considered individually or collectively and thrown into the mix with all of the other factors that I have previously described, I see no basis on this record to fashion a sentence below the advisory guideline range.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b235-9\">Accordingly, we will affirm.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
