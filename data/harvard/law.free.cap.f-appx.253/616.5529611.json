Box\u2019s counsel has moved to withdraw and has filed a brief under <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), arguing that Box\u2019s cooperation, age, and other factors warranted a 50-60% sentence reduction rather than the lower reduction the district court applied. Counsel\u2019s argument is unavailing. <em>See United States v. Haskins, </em>479 F.3d 955, 957 (8th Cir.2007) (per curiam) (court lacks jurisdiction to consider reasonableness of sentence following Rule 35(b) reduction; <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), did not expand 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(a) to include appellate review of discretionary sentencing reductions); <em>United States v. Coppedge, </em>135 F.3d 598, 599 (8th Cir.1998) (per curiam) (challenge to extent of sentence reduction upon government\u2019s Rule 35(b) motion was unreviewable because appeal was not based on any criteria listed in \u00a7 3742(a)).</p>\n<p id=\"b642-23\">Having reviewed the record independently under <em>Penson v. Ohio, </em>488 U.S. 75, 80, 109 S.Ct. 346, 102 L.Ed.2d 300 (1988), we find no nonfrivolous issues.
