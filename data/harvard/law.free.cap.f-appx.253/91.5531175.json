Aug. 24, 2004), <em>aff\u2019g </em>No. A75 962 531 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City May 27, 2003). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-7\">In this case, the BIA adopted and affirmed the IJ\u2019s decision \u201cinsofar as she found that [Singh] had not satisfied the burden of proof for asylum, withholding of removal or relief under the Convention Against Torture.\u201d The BIA further noted that Singh had failed to \u201cmeaningfully address\u201d the IJ\u2019s findings. When the BIA issues an opinion that adopts the IJ\u2019s decision, we review the IJ\u2019s decision. See, <em>e.g., Chun Gao v. Gonzales, </em>424 F.3d 122, 124 (2d Cir.2005); <em>Secaida-Rosales v. INS, </em>331 F.3d 297, 305 (2d Cir.2003). We review the agency\u2019s factual findings under the substantial evidence standard, overturning them only if any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>Zhou Yun Zhang v. INS, </em>386 F.3d 66, 73 (2d Cir.2004), <em>overruled in part on other grounds by Shi Liang Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>494 F.3d 296 (2d Cir.2007) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b118-10\">The Immigration and Nationality Act (\u201cINA\u201d) specifies that we may review only those categories for relief that an applicant raises before the BIA. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1); <em>see Lin Zhong v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>480 F.3d 104, 118 (2d Cir.2007) <em>(amending Lin Zhong v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>461 F.3d 101 (2d Cir.2006)). However, a petitioner\u2019s failure to argue particular issues before the BIA does not, as a statutory matter, bar our jurisdiction to consider those issues. <em>Lin Zhong, </em>480 F.3d at 121-22. We have described an alien\u2019s failure to raise issues before the BIA as \u201can affirmative defense subject to waiver,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 124; however, even when the government does not raise exhaustion in its brief, we may still refuse to consider unexhausted issues, <em>id. </em>at 107 n. 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-11\">The IJ\u2019s finding in regard to burden of proof rested on her adverse credibility finding, which was fraught with errors.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> First, the IJ did not believe that Singh \u201c[wa]s even in fact a Sikh.\u201d The IJ drew an adverse inference from the fact that Singh appeared at his final hearing without a turban and with his hair cut and his beard shaven. However, the IJ failed to assess Singh\u2019s explanation, that he \u201cnow [ ] works for Citywide Limousine Company, and they don\u2019t like that.\u201d <em>See Ming Shi Xue v. BIA, </em>439 F.3d 111, 125 (2d Cir.2006) (stating that it is the IJ\u2019s duty to ensure that the record include both an applicant\u2019s explanation for discrepancies <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>and the IJ\u2019s reasons for rejecting such an explanation). Moreover, the IJ\u2019s inference, that Singh must not actually be Sikh, is not supported by substantial evidence in light of the fact that, as the IJ noted, Singh appeared at all of his previous hearings wearing a turban and with long hair. The IJ also impermissibly drew an adverse inference from the fact that Singh did not provide details as to his understanding of the Sikh faith, <em>see Rizal v. Gonzales, </em>442 F.3d 84, 90 (2d Cir.2006) (\u201cBoth history and common sense make amply clear that people can identify with a certain religion, notwithstanding their lack of detailed knowledge about that religion\u2019s doctrinal tenets.... \u201d), particularly in light of the fact that the IJ did not probe for such details, <em>see Jin Shui Qiu v. Ashcroft, </em>329 F.3d 140, 152 (2d Cir.2003), <em>overruled on other grounds, Shi Liang Lin, </em>494 F.3d 296. Second, the IJ relied on a lack of corroboration in making her adverse credibility determination; however, she did not identify the particular pieces of missing evidence or show that these documents were reasonably available to Singh. <em>See Mei Chai Ye v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>489 F.3d 517, 527 n. 9 (2d Cir.2007). Third, the IJ drew an adverse inference from \u201cthe fact that the respondent\u2019s family members continue to reside undisturbed in his home country\u201d; however, the IJ\u2019s own decision states that Singh testified that his father had been arrested, his wife had been beaten, his three young children had been \u201cstripped of their clothes and paraded through the street,\u201d his family \u201cwas subjected to a lot of harassment,\u201d and since his prior hearing, he had been \u201chearing of problems by phone back home.\u201d Fourth, the IJ questioned \u201cthe <em>bona fides </em>of [Singhj\u2019s claim\u201d based on the fact that he came to the United States on a visa that was \u201cissued to him to perform in the United States,\u201d though \u201che is not actually an artist and never performed in this capacity in this country.\u201d However, we have stated that \u201ca petitioner\u2019s use of false travel documents to escape persecution is fully consistent with an asylum claim and should not be used as a basis to deny asylum.\u201d <em>Rui Ying Lin v. Gonzales, </em>445 F.3d 127, 133 (2d Cir.2006). Fifth, the IJ noted that Singh testified that he joined the Akali Dahl Mann organization on April 4, 1993; however, his asylum application stated that he joined on April 13, 1993. Such a minor inconsistency is not sufficient to support an adverse credibility determination. <em>Secaida-Rosales, </em>331 F.3d at 308. Finally, the IJ took note of some discrepancies in dates between Singh\u2019s direct examination testimony and his testimony on cross-examination. However, as the IJ herself noted, the cross-examination took place almost two years after the direct examination. Also, Singh explained when confronted with these inconsistencies that he was distressed because he had been \u201chearing of problems by phone back home.\u201d The IJ failed to take into consideration these two factors when rendering her adverse credibility determination. <em>See Ming Shi Xue, </em>439 F.3d at 125.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-7\">Given these significant errors in the IJ\u2019s analysis, we cannot confidently predict that the agency would reach the same result on remand absent the error-infected portions of the analysis. <em>See Xiao Ji Chen v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>471 F.3d 315, 338 (2d Cir.2006). Accordingly, the burden of proof finding, which rested on the adverse credibility determination, cannot be sustained.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b120-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>Although we have determined that the adverse credibility determination cannot stand, the IJ also found that Singh posed \u201ca danger to the security of the United States,\u201d and, as the BIA\u2019s decision makes clear, Singh did not challenge that finding on appeal to the BIA. Accordingly, we lack jurisdiction to review that determination, and that determination is dispositive as to Singh\u2019s claims for asylum, <em>see </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(2)(A)(iv); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(c)(1),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> withholding of removal, <em>see </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3)(B)(iv); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.16(d)(2),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and withholding of removal under CAT, <em>see </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3)(B)(iv); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.16(d)(2). However, Singh remains eligible for deferral of removal under CAT. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.17(a).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Accordingly, in light of our determination that the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding cannot stand, the case must be remanded for a determination of whether Singh\u2019s case merits deferral of removal under CAT.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b120-12\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DISMISSED in part and GRANTED in part; the decision of the BIA is VACATED; and the ease is REMANDED to the BIA for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b118-8\">. In his counseled brief to the BIA, Singh challenged the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination generally, but did not argue against the specific findings (listed herein) made by the IJ with respect to the credibility determination. However, because the government waived any argument regarding failure to exhaust issues, we will address those findings. <em>Lin Zhong, </em>480 F.3d at 123-24.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b119-5\">. The IJ also found that Singh had \u201cnot shown that his claim falls under any of the enumerated grounds\u201d for asylum. It is unclear whether the BIA did not explicitly affirm this finding because it disagreed with the finding or because of an observation that the finding was not \"meaningfully addressed on appeal.\u201d However, a review of the record <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>reveals that such an observation was erroneous, as Singh clearly argued this point in his BIA brief. We need not assess this determination in any event, because if the BIA disagreed with the determination, we would not review it, and if the BIA erroneously found that the determination was unexhausted, we would give the BIA the opportunity to assess the determination in the first instance.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b120-7\">. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(c)(1) provides, in relevant part: \"[A]n applicant shall not qualify for asylum if [8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(2)] applies to the applicant.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(2)(A)(iv) renders an alien ineligible for asylum when ''there are reasonable grounds for regarding the alien as a danger to the security of the United States.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b120-8\">. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.16(d)(2) provides, in relevant part: \"[A]n application for withholding of removal under [8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3)] or under the Convention Against Torture shall be denied if the applicant falls within [8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3)(B)].\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231 (b)(3)(B)(iv) renders an alien ineligible for withholding of removal when \"there are reasonable grounds to believe that the alien is a danger to the security of the United States.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b120-15\">. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.17(a) provides, in relevant part: \u201cAn alien who ... has been found ... to be entitled to protection under the Convention Against Torture [] and is subject to the provisions for mandatory denial of withholding of removal under \u00a7 1208.16(d)(2) ..., shall be granted deferral of removal to the country where he or she is more likely than not to be tortured.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b120-16\">. Although we do not have jurisdiction over the IJ\u2019s determination that Singh posed \"a danger to the security of the United States\u201d because he \"assisted a known and wanted terrorist,\u201d for purposes of his claims for asylum, withholding of removal, and withholding of removal under CAT, we note that, on remand, the BIA may wish to reconsider that determination in light of the fact that Singh testified that he did so under duress and at gunpoint and in light of the fact that Singh is no longer represented by the attorney that failed to address this issue in his BIA brief.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
