Morales was sentenced to the term recommended by the Guidelines. Morales submits that he is entitled to re-sentencing on the ground that the sentence was unreasonable. We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts, procedural history, and specification of appellate issues, which we refer to only as necessary to explain our decision to affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-16\">In his plea agreement, Morales agreed that he would \u201cnot file a direct appeal ... [from] any sentence at or below the Stipulated Sentence ... (20 years).\u201d In his timely appeal, Morales argued (1) that the sentencing judge failed to proffer any legitimate reasons for the sentence he imposed, including the reasons for imposing a consecutive sentence; and (2) that the sentencing judge failed to consider the Section 3553(a) factors. The government moved to dismiss the appeal on the ground that it was barred by the valid appellate waiver. On October 12, 2006, this Court granted in part and denied in part the government\u2019s motion. The Court ruled that Morales\u2019s appeal is barred to the extent that he argues that the sentencing judge failed adequately to explain the reasons for the sentence imposed. However, the Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>ordered additional briefing on whether the appellate waiver applied to Morales\u2019s challenge to the imposition of consecutive sentences. We now hold that it does. Morales relies on several cases in which this Court held that an appellate waiver did not encompass the defendant\u2019s challenge to the imposition of consecutive sentences. In each of the cases upon which Morales relies, however, the intent of the parties was ambiguous, because the agreement did not specify whether the sentence would run concurrently or consecutively to another sentence. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Williams, </em>260 F.3d 160, 166 (2d Cir.2001) (noting that \u201cthe bargain [wa]s silent about whether the parties intended the sentences to run concurrently or consecutively\u201d); <em>United States v. Velasquez, </em>136 F.3d 921, 922 (2d Cir.1998). Here there is no such ambiguity. Morales pleaded guilty to two counts in the indictment, each of which carried a statutory maximum of ten years\u2019 imprisonment. Hence, by agreeing not to appeal any sentence at or below twenty years\u2019 imprisonment, Morales was necessarily agreeing not to appeal the imposition of consecutive sentences. Thus, the appellate waiver bars Morales\u2019s argument that the sentencing court failed adequately to explain its reasons for running the sentences consecutively. <em>See United States v. Yemitan, 70 </em>F.3d 746, 748 (2d Cir.1995).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
