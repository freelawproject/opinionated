State Farm alleged that Dr. Lincow and his associates actively participated in a scheme by which they extracted over $1.4 million from insurers based upon, <em>inter alia, </em>fraudulent medical records, reports, prescriptions, bills, and referrals.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-10\">After several pre-trial conferences, two motions to dismiss, a motion for summary judgment, and numerous discovery rulings, Dr. Lincow filed a motion requesting that Judge Robreno recuse himself based on an appearance of bias.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Dr. Lincow contended that Judge Robreno expressed an \u201cunfavorable predisposition\u201d against him during criminal proceedings in 2003. After briefing and oral argument on the matter, Judge Robreno denied the motion, and denied a motion to stay the proceedings pending the present petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-14\">After careful review of the relevant transcripts, we conclude that Judge Robreno did not abuse his discretion when he refused to recuse himself. His remarks during the Hirsh proceedings do not warrant recusal. \u201c[Ojpinions formed by the judge on the basis of facts introduced or events occurring in the course of the current proceedings, or of prior proceedings, do not constitute a basis for a bias or partiality motion unless they display a deep-seated favoritism or antagonism that would make fair judgment impossible.\u201d <em>Liteky v. United States, </em>510 U.S. 540, 555, 114 S.Ct. 1147, 127 L.Ed.2d 474 (1994). Judge Robreno merely expressed his opinion that the Government should prosecute physicians, as well as other individuals who engage in insurance fraud. His comments do not reveal a \u201cdeep-seated antagonism\u201d toward Dr. Lincow specifically, nor do they raise any serious doubts regarding his impartiality three years later.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-15\">We conclude that Judge Robreno did not abuse his discretion in refusing to recuse himself. Accordingly, we will decline to issue the writ of mandamus.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b270-11\">. Dr. Lincow did not identify a statutory basis for his claim before the District Court, but now bases his claim on 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 455.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
