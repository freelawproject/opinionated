We presume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the facts and procedural history of the case, and the arguments on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-6\">As an initial matter, because the notice of appeal is timely from the denials of both the underlying judgment and the motion to reconsider, <em>see </em>Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(4), both of those orders are reviewed on appeal even though the notice of appeal references only the denial of reconsideration, <em>see Marrero Pichardo v. Ashcroft, </em>374 F.3d 46, 54-55 (2d Cir.2004). This Court reviews a district court\u2019s dismissal of a complaint for failure to state a claim pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) <em>de novo. See Cooper v. Parsky, </em>140 F.3d 433, 440 (2d Cir. 1998). Further, a district court\u2019s order denying a motion for reconsideration is reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>See Transaero, Inc. v. La Fuerza Aerea Boliviana, </em>162 F.3d 724, 729 (2d Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b173-7\">Having reviewed the record, we agree that appellant\u2019s complaint should have been dismissed for the reasons stated by the district court. Also, the district court correctly analyzed the relevant factual and legal issues and did not abuse its discretion in denying appellant\u2019s motion for reconsideration. Therefore, we hold that appellant\u2019s claims were properly dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-8\">Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
