Thorpe\u2019s attorney on appeal has filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), certifying there are no meritorious issues for appeal, but questioning whether Thorpe\u2019s sentence was reasonable. Thorpe was advised of his right to file a pro se supplemental brief, but has not done so. Finding no reversible error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-16\">Counsel questions the reasonableness of Thorpe\u2019s sentence. After <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), a sentencing court is no longer bound by the range prescribed by the sentencing guidelines, but still must calculate and consider the guideline range as well as the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) (2000). <em>See United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540, 546 (4th Cir.2005). We will affirm a post <em>-Booker </em>sentence if it is both reasonable and within the statutorily prescribed range. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b324-17\">In the presentence report, Thorpe\u2019s base offense level was determined to be 32. <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>(\u201cUSSG\u201d), \u00a7 2D 1.1 (c)(4) (2005). However, because Thorpe was determined to be a career offender under USSG \u00a7 4B1.1, his offense level was enhanced to 37. After he received a three-level adjustment for acceptance of responsibility, Thorpe had a total offense level of 34. With an offense level of 34 and career offender criminal history category VI, his advisory guidelines range was 262 to 327 months\u2019 imprisonment. There were no objections to the presentence report. The Government filed a motion for downward departure under USSG \u00a7 5K1.1, based on substantial assistance. The district court granted the motion, departed below the advisory guidelines range, and sentenced Thorpe to 180 months in prison, which was within the statutorily prescribed range of ten years to life imprisonment. The district court ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>propriately treated the guidelines as advisory, considered the guideline range and the Government\u2019s \u00a7 5K1.1 motion for downward departure, and weighed the relevant factors under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3558(a) (2000) in imposing Thorpe\u2019s sentence. We therefore find Thorpe\u2019s sentence is reasonable and within the statutorily prescribed range.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record in this case and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. We therefore affirm Thorpe\u2019s conviction and sentence. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
