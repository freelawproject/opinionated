After relocating to Tennessee following his Georgia conviction, Jones had obtained a Tennessee court restoration of rights. The district court rejected his motion to dismiss the federal felon-in-possession charge based on the Tennessee order, and Jones pled guilty to the \u00a7 922 charge. He was convicted and sentenced. Jones argues on appeal that: (1) Tennessee\u2019s restoration of his \u201cfull rights of citizenship\u201d barred his prosecution under \u00a7 922(g)(1); (2) his 1971 conviction should not have been considered in determining the base offense level of his sentence; and (3) his prosecution and conviction under \u00a7 922 violate the <em>Ex Post Facto </em>Clause. Because under the federal felon-in-possession statute we must look to Georgia law rather than Tennessee law regarding restoration of rights, and because Jones\u2019s other arguments are without merit, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-14\">On March 3, 1971, Richard Jones was convicted of aggravated assault and murder in Jackson, Georgia. His sentences for those convictions expired on January 21, 1991. The Government asserts \u2014 and Jones does not dispute- \u2014 that on January 4, 1991, the Georgia State Board of Pardons and Parole restored Jones\u2019s civil and political rights, expressly excluding the right to \u201creceive, possess, or transport in commerce a firearm.\u201d In the meantime, Jones moved to Tennessee, where his \u201cfull rights of citizenship\u201d were restored on November 23, 1994, by a state circuit court in Hamilton County, Tennessee.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-15\">On February 2, 2004, Jones was arrested in Chattanooga, Tennessee, on domestic violence charges. During a search incident to his arrest, the Chattanooga Police found 10 firearms at the residence. Jones admitted owning the guns, which included 4 or 5 rifles, 5 pistols, and 1 shotgun. All of the firearms were manufactured outside of Tennessee and had previously been shipped in interstate commerce.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>On November 1, 2005, Jones was indicted by a federal grand jury for violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1), which makes it unlawful for any person \u201cwho has been convicted ... of a crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year\u201d to possess a firearm. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1) (2000). Jones filed a motion to dismiss based on the Tennessee restoration of rights, which motion the district court denied. Jones entered a guilty plea, reserving the right to appeal the district court\u2019s ruling on his motion to dismiss. He was sentenced to 18 months in prison. The district court determined that, because Jones was a \u201cprohibited person\u201d at the time of his 2004 offense, the base level for his sentence was 14 under the federal Sentencing Guidelines. Four levels were added because the offense involved 10 firearms, and three levels were removed because Jones accepted responsibility, resulting in a total level of 15. Jones now appeals his conviction and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-4\">Jones argues on appeal that his Tennessee restoration of rights precludes his federal prosecution for felon-in-possession. However, the law is clear that Jones\u2019s rights must be restored under Georgia law for this purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">Georgia law, rather than Tennessee law, determines whether Jones\u2019s 1971 conviction constitutes a predicate offense under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1). Chapter 28 of the United States Code makes it unlawful for any person \u201cwho has been convicted ... of a crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year\u201d to</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AnH\">ship or transport in interstate or foreign commerce, or possess in or affecting commerce, any firearm or ammunition; or to receive any firearm or ammunition which has been shipped or transported in interstate or foreign commerce.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b578-6\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1) (2000). In defining the phrase \u201ccrime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year,\u201d Congress provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b578-8\">What constitutes a conviction of such a crime shall be determined <em>in accordance with the latv of the jurisdiction in which the proceedings were held. </em>Any conviction which has been expunged, or set aside or for which a person has been pardoned or <em>has had civil rights restored </em>shall not be considered a conviction for purposes of this chapter, <em>unless </em>such pardon, expungement, or restoration of civil rights <em>expressly provides that the person may not ship, transport, possess, or receive firearms.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b578-9\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 921(a)(20) (emphasis added). In other words, this exemption clause provides that a conviction for which a person has had civil rights restored is not considered a predicate conviction under \u00a7 922(g)(1), \u201cunless\u201d the restoration \u201cexpressly provides that the person may not ... possess ... firearms.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b578-10\">The Supreme Court in <em>Beecham v. United States </em>squarely held that, under this provision, the law of the jurisdiction in which proceedings were held applies not only to what is a conviction, but also to the effect of post-conviction events under the statute. 511 U.S. 368, 372, 114 S.Ct. 1669, 128 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994). The Court expressly rejected a contention that the applicable law was instead the state law of the place of later weapon possession. <em>Id.; see also United States v. Lang, </em>46 Fed.Appx. 816, 818 (6th Cir.2002) (unpublished) (applying the <em>Beecham </em>rule).</p>\n<p id=\"b578-11\">Jones\u2019s argument based on Tennessee law is therefore unavailing, and he has neither claimed nor set forth evidence that his Georgia restoration contained no express firearms limitation. Absent such a contention regarding Georgia law, Jones\u2019s 2004 prosecution under \u00a7 922(g)(1) for possession of firearms was proper. See <em>United States v. Flower, </em>29 F.3d 530, 535 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>(10th Cir.1994), which held that it is up to the felon-in-possession defendant to challenge the admissibility of a prior conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">It was also proper for the district court to consider Jones\u2019s 1971 conviction in calculating his sentence under the Sentencing Guidelines. The Guidelines instruct the court to apply a base offense level of 14 if the defendant \u201cwas a prohibited person at the time the defendant committed the instant offense.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(6)(A). \u201cProhibited person\u201d is defined in Application Note 3 to mean \u201cany person described in 18 U.S.C. 922(g) or 922(n).\u201d Section 922(g) lists certain categories of individuals who are prohibited from, among other things, receiving firearms that have been transported in interstate commerce. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g). For the reasons stated above, Jones is properly considered to be one of the persons prohibited by \u00a7 922(g) from possessing such firearms. Because he is a \u201cprohibited person\u201d under \u00a7 922(g), the district court properly assigned him a base offense level of 14 under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(6)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b579-6\">Finally, contrary to Jones\u2019s argument, his prosecution under \u00a7 922(g)(1) does not violate the <em>Ex Post Facto </em>Clause. The prohibited conduct \u2014 his possession of a firearm \u2014 occurred after the enactment of \u00a7 922. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Haire, </em>89 Fed.Appx. 551, 555 (6th Cir.2004) (unpublished); <em>United States v. Pfeifer, </em>371 F.3d 430, 436-37 (8th Cir.2004); <em>United States v. Hemmings, </em>258 F.3d 587, 594 (7th Cir.2001); <em>United States v. Mitchell, </em>209 F.3d 319, 322-23 (4th Cir.2000); <em>United States v. Brady, </em>26 F.3d 282, 290-91 (2d Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b579-7\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm Jones\u2019s conviction and sentence.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
