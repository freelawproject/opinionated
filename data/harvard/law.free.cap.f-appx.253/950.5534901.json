Wyeroski (\u201cWyeroski\u201d) seeks review of a final decision of the Merit Systems Protection Board (\u201cthe Board\u201d) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"951\">*951</page-number>dismissing his petition for review as untimely filed, without good cause shown for the delay. <em>Wyeroski v. Dep\u2019t of Transp., </em>106 M.S.P.R. 7 (2007). Because the Board did not abuse its discretion in concluding that Wyeroski failed to show good cause for his untimely filing, we <em>affirm.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b977-5\">The Federal Aviation Administration removed Wyeroski from his position as Aviation Safety Inspector based on various charges of misconduct. In a June 3, 2003, initial decision, an administrative judge affirmed the agency\u2019s removal action. The initial decision became final on July 8, 2003, when neither party filed a petition for review. <em>See </em>5 C.F.R. \u00a7 1201.113.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-6\">On February 5, 2007, Wyeroski filed a request with the Board to reopen his case, alleging that newly-discovered evidence impeached the credibility of Richard Martin, the primary witness in his removal action. The Board construed Wyeroski\u2019s request as an untimely-filed petition for review and, as such, notified him that he must file a motion, supported by affidavit or statement signed under penalty of perjury, showing good cause for the delay. <em>See </em>5 C.F.R. \u00a7 1201.114(f).</p>\n<p id=\"b977-7\">Wyeroski did not file a motion or sworn statement as required by \u00a7 1201.114(f). For that reason, the Board deemed his request insufficient to excuse the delay. <em>Wyeroski, </em>106 M.S.P.R. at 10 (\u201c[Wjhen a party\u2019s explanation for the untimeliness of a petition for review is not submitted in the form of an affidavit or statement signed under penalty of perjury, it is insufficient to establish the assertions it contains.\u201d). Nevertheless, the Board examined Wyeroski\u2019s explanation \u2014 predicated on newly-discovered evidence \u2014 and concluded that even if sworn, it was insufficient to constitute good cause. Acknowledging that the discovery of new evidence may in some instances establish good cause, the Board reasoned that Wyeroski\u2019s proffered evidence did not. The Board so concluded because: (i) \u201c[ejvidence offered merely to impeach a witness\u2019s credibility ... is generally not considered new and material\u201d; and (ii) the initial decision affirming Wyeroski\u2019s removal was based \u201cupon substantially more evidence ... than the testimony of [Martin] alone.\u201d Accordingly, the Board found lack of good cause and dismissed the petition as untimely filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-9\">This court\u2019s scope of review of Board decisions is defined and limited by statute. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7703(c). \u201cThe agency\u2019s action in this ease must be affirmed unless it is found to be: (1) arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law; (2) obtained without procedures required by law, rule or regulation having been followed; or (3) unsupported by substantial evidence.\u201d <em>Hayes v. Dep\u2019t of the Navy, </em>727 F.2d 1535, 1537 (Fed.Cir.1984). \u201cThe petitioner bears the burden of establishing error in the Board\u2019s decision.\u201d <em>Harris v. DVA, </em>142 F.3d 1463, 1467 (Fed.Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b977-10\">In this appeal, Wyeroski first contends that he did not have an opportunity to file a motion or sworn statement because the Board notice directing him to do so was sent by e-mail. We need not address this issue, however, because we, as did the Board, address his argument on the merits. In this regard, Wyeroski primarily rehashes the documents and testimony presented at his removal hearing and argues that the Board should reconsider the case in light of the newly-discovered evidence, which is alleged to impugn Martin\u2019s credibility. Br. for Pet\u2019r at 13 (\u201cI ask that this brief, be accepted as my appeal to the MSPB and instruct them to review the appeal transcript and the allegations against me, in lieu of this new evidence against the chief witness against me ....\u201d). <em>See generally id. </em>at 3-11. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"952\">*952</page-number>Board cannot, however, overturn an administrative judge\u2019s demeanor-based credibility determinations unless it has \u201csufficiently sound\u201d reasons. <em>Haebe v. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>288 F.3d 1288, 1301 (Fed.Cir.2002). The Board reviewed Wyeroski\u2019s evidence, which related primarily to Martin\u2019s misconduct after Wyeroski was removed, and determined that it \u201cd[id] not provide sufficiently sound reasons to overturn the credibility determinations made by the administrative judge who observed the witnesses at the hearing.\u201d The Board thus concluded that the evidence was not \u201cof sufficient weight to warrant an outcome different from the initial decision.\u201d We have carefully reviewed the record and find no basis to conclude that the Board in any way abused its discretion in reaching this conclusion. Consequently, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b978-4\">COSTS</p>\n<p id=\"b978-5\">No costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
