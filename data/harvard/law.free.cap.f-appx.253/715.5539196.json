He challenges his conviction and his sentence, and we affirm as to both.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-5\">1. Vargas\u2019s argument that the government failed to present sufficient evidence to prove that he had actually been removed from the United States prior to his reentry is without merit. The government introduced a warrant of removal stating that Vargas was deported on September 2, 2003, and signed by an INS official who attested to having witnessed Vargas\u2019s departure. This warrant constituted sufficient evidence of Vargas\u2019s prior physical removal.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See United States v. Bahena-Cardenas, </em>411 F.3d 1067, 1075 (9th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b742-6\">2. Vargas\u2019s challenge to his underlying deportation is likewise unavailing. Vargas failed to introduce any evidence that would support a plausible showing that he would have received an \u201cextreme hardship\u201d waiver of his inadmissibility under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(h) (1994).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Thus, the IJ\u2019s failure to advise Vargas of his potential avenues of relief was not prejudicial.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-10\">3. Finally, Vargas\u2019s 86-month sentence was reasonable under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). Vargas\u2019s sentence fell in the middle of the Guidelines range and was not substantially greater than his previous sentence for illegal reentry.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b742-7\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b742-8\">. Vargas\u2019s suggestion that the warrant was not actually admitted into evidence because the district court sustained two hearsay objections during testimony about the warrant is also without merit. The warrant of removal was received into evidence without objection; the two subsequent hearsay objections were made to the witness's testimony about the warrant, not to the warrant itself.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b742-14\">. Vargas was inadmissible under \u00a7 1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(I) (1994) because his 1990 conviction under Cal.Penal Code \u00a7 273.5 constituted a crime of moral turpitude. <em>See Grageda v. I.N.S., </em>12 F.3d 919, 922 (9th Cir.1993).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
