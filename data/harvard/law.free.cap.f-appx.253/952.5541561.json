Lacking jurisdiction, this court <em>dismisses </em>Mr. Calderon\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b979-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b979-8\">Mr. Calderon is a veteran of World War II, having served on active duty in the United States Army from January 1942 to October 1945. Nearly five decades later, in August 2001, Mr. Calderon filed a claim for service connection for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). In October of that year, he underwent a Veterans Administration (VA) medical examination. The examiner diagnosed Mr. Calderon as suffering from an anxiety disorder, with the primary stressors for this condition being aging and his son\u2019s death. In February 2002, a VA regional office (RO) denied his claim for service connection for PTSD.</p>\n<p id=\"b979-9\">In January 2004, a psychiatrist\u2019s comment that Mr. Calderon suffered from an \u201c[ajnxiety disorder ... related to World War II combat\u201d was included in a VA medical progress note. Also in January 2004, Mr. Calderon\u2019s representative told the Board that Mr. Calderon was seeking service connection for PTSD \u201cor anxieties secondary to the trauma of combat\u201d and for traumatic incidents including Mr. Calderon\u2019s combat wounds. In July 2004, the Board remanded Mr. Calderon\u2019s claim back to the RO for additional development and compliance with the Veterans\u2019 Claims Assistance Act of 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b979-10\">Soon after the remand, in August 2004, Mr. Calderon underwent another VA medical examination. The examiner stated that it was \u201cunlikely\u201d that Mr. Calderon\u2019s anxiety disorder was caused by his military service, but noted that any anxiety disorder may have been \u201caggravated\u201d by his military service. In May 2005, the Board denied Mr. Calderon\u2019s claim for service connection for an anxiety order, which the Veterans Court affirmed in June 2007. Mr. Calderon now appeals to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b979-11\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b979-12\">This court\u2019s jurisdiction to review decisions of the Veterans Court is limited. Under 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7292(a), this court has jurisdiction over rules of law or the validity of any statute or regulation, or an interpretation thereof relied on by the Veterans Court in its decision. This court may also entertain challenges to the validity of a statute or regulation, and to interpret constitutional and statutory provisions as needed for resolution of the matter. 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7292(c). In contrast, except where an appeal presents a constitutional question, this court lacks jurisdiction over challenges to factual determinations or laws or regulations as applied to the particular case. 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7292(d)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b979-13\">Mr. Calderon asserts in his informal brief to this court that his appeal involves several constitutional questions, giving this court jurisdiction. Specifically, Mr. Calderon asserts violations of his due process and equal protection rights. He bases these assertions on the regulatory definition of mental or psychoneurotic disorders, the failure of the Board and Veterans Court to afford him due process as a non-attorney appellant, the absence of \u201cmutual professional respect\u201d during his arguments, the inadequate weighing of his long-term unemployability due to combat wounds, his failing mental and physical <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"954\">*954</page-number>health, and a multitude of other allegations related to his claim for service connection.</p>\n<p id=\"b980-4\">A mere assertion of a constitutional claim does not confer jurisdiction on this court. <em>See Helfer v. West, </em>174 F.3d 1332, 1335 (Fed.Cir.1999). Nothing in Mr. Calderon\u2019s brief presents a true constitutional question that gives this court jurisdiction. Instead, Mr. Calderon\u2019s appeal seeks review of the Veterans Court\u2019s factual determinations and its application of the law to Mr. Calderon\u2019s particular situation. Even though Mr. Calderon has asserted that the Veterans Court and Board decisions violate his constitutional rights, this court perceives no genuine constitutional dimension to his allegations. Therefore, this court is unable to review them. This court thus lacks jurisdiction and must dismiss Mr. Calderon\u2019s appeal.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
