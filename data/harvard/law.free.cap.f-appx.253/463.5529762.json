Rodriguez-Hernandez contends that the BIA erred by determining that he was ineligible for relief pursuant to \u00a7 1182(c). The respondent moves for summary affirmance or, in the alternative, an extension of time to file a brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-22\">Rodriguez-Hernandez has not shown error in connection with the BIA\u2019s determination that he had failed to establish his status as a lawful permanent resident of the United States. <em>See INS v. Phinpathya, </em>464 U.S. 183, 188 n. 6, 104 S.Ct. 584, 78 L.Ed.2d 401 (1984). He has concomitantly failed to carry his burden of showing that he is eligible for relief under former \u00a7 1182(c). <em>See Vo v. Gonzales, </em>482 F.3d 363, 366-70 (5th Cir.2007); <em>see also Ashby v. INS, </em>961 F.2d 555, 557 (5th Cir.1992). Rodriguez-Hernandez\u2019s petition for review is DENIED. The respondent\u2019s motion is likewise DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b489-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
