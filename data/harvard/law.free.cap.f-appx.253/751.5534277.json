McKAY, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b777-20\">Petitioner, a state prisoner represented by counsel, seeks a certificate of appealability to appeal the district court\u2019s denial of his \u00a7 2254 habeas petition. Petitioner contends that he received ineffective assistance of counsel in his trial for first-degree and attempted first-degree murder because counsel failed to interview and present testimony from a woman who would have contradicted some of the testimony given by a key prosecution witness. This claim was rejected in state postconviction proceedings, and the federal magistrate judge concluded that this rejection was not \u201ccontrary to\u201d and did not \u201cinvolve[] an unreasonable application of[] clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1) (2006). The magistrate judge agreed with Petitioner that one of the state appellate court\u2019s factual findings was not supported by the record. However, this finding was not critical to the state court's other factual determinations nor to the court\u2019s conclusion that Petitioner had not demonstrated that he received ineffective assistance of counsel. After considering Petitioner\u2019s objections, the district court adopted and approved the magistrate judge\u2019s recommendation and accordingly denied the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-21\">To obtain a certificate of appealability, Petitioner must make \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2) (2006). In order to meet this burden, Petitioner must demonstrate \u201cthat reasonable jurists could debate whether (or, for that matter, agree that) the petition should have been re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"752\">*752</page-number>solved in a different manner or that the issues presented were adequate to deserve encouragement to proceed further.\u201d <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b778-4\">We have carefully reviewed Petitioner\u2019s filings, the magistrate judge\u2019s thorough report and recommendation, the district court\u2019s disposition, and the record on appeal, including the record from the state trial and postconviction proceedings. Nothing in these materials raises an issue which meets our standard for the grant of a certificate of appealability. For substantially the reasons set forth by the magistrate judge and district court, we DENY Petitioner\u2019s request for a certificate of appealability and DISMISS the appeal.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b777-17\"> This order is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R.App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
