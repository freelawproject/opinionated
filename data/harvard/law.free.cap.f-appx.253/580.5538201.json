On the one hand, we agree with the Commissioner that, even if the district court incorrectly assigned error to the ALJ\u2019s ruling that some of Fisk\u2019s impairments were not \u201csevere,\u201d any error was harmless. On the other hand, we agree with Fisk that the district court correctly identified a material failure by the ALJ to follow the procedural requirements of 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1527(d)(2) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>before disregarding the opinion of Fisk\u2019s treating physician. We accordingly reverse in part, affirm in part and remand the case to the agency to correct the procedural error.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-6\">Born in 1950, Michael Fisk is married and has four teenage children. Fisk graduated from the police academy in 1975 and earned an Associate\u2019s degree in criminal justice in 1992. Over the past 20 years, he has worked as a restaurant manager, delivery driver, corrections officer, security guard and mill worker. In March 2001, while working at a mill in Florida, Fisk began suffering from a variety of conditions, including \u201csudden blackouts from [vasojvagal [and] hypertension, constant back pain, hand cramps ... from osteoarthritis, headaches, nausea, hot flashes from ... diabetes along with shak[i]ness in hands and inability to focus vision [and] lack of energy.\u201d AR 108. He became unable to work at the mill on October 5, 2001, he alleges, and he quit working there on October 8. In the last few months of 2001, Fisk applied for disability insurance benefits and Supplemental Security Income, claiming he was disabled due to uncontrolled diabetes, hypertension, osteoarthritis, vasovagal syncope and diabetic retinopathy.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-7\">Fisk, regrettably, is no stranger to doctors\u2019 offices. Beginning in 2000, he suffered from chest pain, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, high blood sugar and high cholesterol. His treating physician, Dr. Marcus Williams, diagnosed him with onset diabetes mellitus and uncontrolled hypertension but found \u201cno evidence of any significant coronary artery disease.\u201d AR 266. In April and October 2001, Fisk made two separate visits to the emergency room. During the first visit, a chest x-ray revealed right lower lobe pneumonia, and Dr. Williams noted that Fisk had an \u201cepisode of near syncope\u201d \u2014 or fainting. AR 161; see 8 Lee R. Russ et ah, Attorneys Medical Advisor \u00a7 75:36. After the second visit, the hospital advised Fisk to follow up with his physician. In October, Fisk began to see Dr. Chanun Park, who diagnosed Fisk with Type II diabetes mellitus, obesity, gastritis, hypertension and osteoarthritis. Dr. Park recommended that Fisk \u201crefrain from working\u201d in the mill because it \u201cdeals with heavy duty machine tools without air conditioning.\u201d AR 205. In response to a request made by the state agency responsible for processing Fisk\u2019s claim for benefits, Dr. Park opined that Fisk had no loss of motion or deformity of the major joints; minimal muscle spasm, loss of motion of the spine and deficits in the extremities; a 4/5 grip strength; normal gait and station; the ability to squat; and the ability to \u201csometimes\u201d walk on toes and heels. AR 199.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-9\">The state agency also requested residual functional capacity assessments from other physicians who had reviewed Fisk\u2019s records. In August 2002, Dr. A.E. Archibald-Long concluded that Fisk had \u201cseveral credible impairments\u201d but maintained the ability to lift up to 50 pounds occasionally and 25 pounds frequently; to stand or walk for a total of about 6 hours per day; and to sit for a total of 6 hours per day. AR 260. To support his assessment, Dr. Archibald-Long listed several of Fisk\u2019s conditions, including hypertension and diabetes without end-organ damage and non-occlusive coronary artery disease. Dr. J.D. Perez recommended the same exertional limitations and added that Fisk should avoid even moderate exposure to fumes, odors, dusts, gases and poor ventilation.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-10\">In January 2003, Fisk and his family moved from Florida to Ohio, where Dr. Anil Agarwal became Fisk\u2019s treating phy<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>sician. Dr. Agarwal referred Fisk to the Dayton Eye Associates, but the physician there found no evidence of diabetic retinopathy. He also referred Fisk to Dr. Ir-shad Hussain, a cardiologist who noted that Fisk had \u201c[a]typical chest pain for cardiac ischemia\u201d and multiple risk factors. AR 327. On March 3, Dr. Agarwal completed a report listing Fisk\u2019s numerous medical problems and noting a number of limitations: Fisk could stand or walk for only one to two hours per day and for up to one hour without interruption; he could sit for up to one hour per day; he could lift up to five pounds; he had a \u201cmarkedly limited\u201d ability to push, pull, bend, reach, handle and make repetitive foot movements; and he had a \u201cmoderately limited\u201d ability to see. AR 370.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-4\">Between March and October, Fisk saw many more specialists for consultations, generally at the recommendation of Dr. Agarwal. Dr. Mangala Venkatesh conducted a neurological examination based on Fisk\u2019s tremors, noted that Fisk had a \u201ctrace tremor\u201d in his hands \u201cwith posture and action\u201d and concluded that Fisk may have mild essential tremor \u2014 a nerve disorder, <em>see </em>3 Russ et al., <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 28:371\u2014 or mild Parkinson\u2019s syndrome. AR 291. Dr. Ramesh K. Gandhi discovered a small hiatal hernia with mild inflammation. At the Center for Cholesterol Treatment and Education, Dr. Lawrence Mieczkowski modified Fisk\u2019s medications for hyperlipidemia \u2014 a condition associated with high cholesterol, <em>see </em>8 Russ et al., <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 85:16 \u2014 and diabetes. In September, testing showed \u201cfatty liver,\u201d a chronic liver condition often found in obese diabetics, AR 368; <em>see </em>Leon A. Adams et al., <em>Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease, </em>172(7) Canadian Med. Ass\u2019n J. 899, 899 (2005), and an x-ray revealed sclerotic changes in the shoulder area that \u201cmay reflect chronic [rotator] cuff disease,\u201d AR 363; <em>see </em>4 Russ et al., <em>swpra, </em>\u00a7 35:126. Dr. Robert Hawkins noted that Fisk\u2019s cervical spine had a \u201climited range of motion in all planes\u201d and that his shoulders had \u201climited active range of motion but normal passive range of motion.\u201d AR 379. Based on Fisk\u2019s left-shoulder symptoms, Dr. Hawkins concluded that Fisk suffered from osteoarthritis and probable diabetic tendonopathy, a tendon condition. An x-ray of Fisk\u2019s right knee revealed moderately severe arthropathy, or joint disease.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-6\">On October 4, Fisk was hospitalized overnight for chest and throat pain and an episode of dizziness. Dr. Hussain ordered a cardiac catherization, which showed \u201cmild single vessel coronary artery disease.\u201d AR 316.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-7\">In a letter to Fisk\u2019s attorney on November 10, Dr. Agarwal stated that Fisk \u201chas been totally disabled since October 2001\u201d and noted that Fisk suffers from \u201cnon-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus, hypertension, vasovagal syncope, severe right knee arthropathy, fatty liver, cysts of liver, arthritis of back and hand, erectile dysfunction, heart murmur, diabetic retinopathy, diverticulosis, low testosterone, hyperlipidemia, tremors in hand radiating up arm and down legs, cholecystitis, cholithiasis, 50 to 60% blockage in left coronary artery, hiatal hernia, GERD and bradycardia.\u201d AR 340. In his functional capacity assessment, Dr. Agarwal recommended significant limitations: Fisk could lift and carry up to five pounds occasionally; he could stand or walk for one to two hours in an eight-hour day but only up to one hour without interruption; he could sit for one to two hours in an eight-hour day but only up to one hour without interruption; he could \u201cnever\u201d climb, balance, stoop, crouch, kneel or crawl; his impairments affected his ability to reach, push and pull because he \u201chas limited mobility and is at risk for falls [and] passing out,\u201d AR 344; and he should not work in environments <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>involving heights, moving machinery, chemicals, temperature extremes, vibration, dust, fumes and humidity because he \u201cis at risk for falls [and] passing out\u201d and has \u201climited mobility,\u201d AR 345. Dr. Agarwal also cited Fisk\u2019s arthritis, vasovagal syncope and tremors in support of his findings and attached 32 pages of supporting documentation.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-5\">When the agency denied Fisk\u2019s application for benefits, he sought review of the decision. The ALJ concluded that Fisk was not under a \u201cdisability\u201d as defined by the Social Security Act; although the ALJ determined that Fisk suffered from severe impairments of right knee osteoarthritis and dysthymia (a type of mild chronic depression, <em>see </em>Fisk Br. at 11 n. 2), the ALJ maintained that Fisk retained the residual functional capacity to perform work in the Dayton area as an injection molding machine tender, an assembler, a hand packager or a machine packager.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-6\">After the Appeals Council denied review, Fisk sought judicial review in the district court. Adopting a magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation that identified several errors in the ALJ\u2019s handling of the case, the district court remanded the case to the agency.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-8\">The question in these cases is whether the ALJ applied the correct legal standard and whether substantial evidence supports the ALJ\u2019s findings. <em>Key v. Callahan, </em>109 F.3d 270, 273 (6th Cir.1997). We give de novo review to the district court\u2019s conclusions on each front. <em>Valley v. Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec., </em>427 F.3d 388, 390 (6th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b609-9\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-10\">The Commissioner argues that the district court erred in holding that the ALJ committed reversible legal error at step two of the five-step disability analysis, which asks whether the individual has a \u201csevere medically determinable physical or mental impairment\u201d or \u201ca combination of impairments that is severe.\u201d 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520(a)(4)(ii). The ALJ found that Fisk had only two severe impairments\u2014 right knee osteoarthritis and dysthmyia\u2014 rejecting in the process Fisk\u2019s other allegedly severe impairments, including mild coronai\u2019y artery disease and uncontrolled diabetes. The district court held that the ALJ erred by applying the incorrect standard for severity and by injecting his lay opinion into the analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-12\">When an ALJ determines that one or more impairments is severe, the ALJ \u201cmust consider limitations and restrictions imposed by all of an individual\u2019s impairments, even those that are not \u2018severe.\u2019 \u201d Soc. Sec. Rui. 96-8p, 1996 WL 374184, at *5. And when an ALJ considers all of a claimant\u2019s impairments in the remaining steps of the disability determination, an ALJ\u2019s failure to find additional severe impairments at step two \u201c[does] not constitute reversible error.\u201d <em>Maziarz v. Sec\u2019y of Health &amp; Human Servs., </em>837 F.2d 240, 244 (6th Cir.1987). In <em>Maziarz, </em>the agency determined that the claimant suffered from several severe impairments but that his cervical condition was not severe. <em>Id. </em>Because the agency continued with the remaining steps in the disability determination and because the agency \u201cproperly could consider claimant\u2019s cervical condition in determining whether claimant retained sufficient residual functional capacity to allow him to perform substantial gainful activity,\u201d the court held that any error at step two was harmless and that it was therefore \u201cunnecessary to decide\u201d whether the agency erred in failing to find that the claimant\u2019s cervical condition constituted a severe impairment. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b610-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>The same conclusion applies here. As in <em>Maziarz, </em>the ALJ decided that Fisk suffered from some severe impairments but that his remaining conditions were not severe. In the remaining steps of the disability determination, the ALJ \u201cconsider[ed] limitations and restrictions imposed by all of [Fisk]\u2019s impairments,\u201d including his non-severe impairments. Soc. Sec. Rui. 96-8p, 1996 WL 374184, at *5. When he assessed Fisk\u2019s residual functional capacity, the ALJ accounted for Fisk\u2019s claim of coronary artery disease, stating that Fisk \u201cunderwent extensive cardiac evaluation that was negative for significant coronary disease.\u201d AR 25. The ALJ also considered Fisk\u2019s diabetes, explaining that \u201cthe record did not document end organ damage secondary to ... diabetes.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Because the ALJ considered these impairments when determining Fisk\u2019s residual functional capacity, \u201c[w]e find it unnecessary to decide\u201d whether the ALJ erred in classifying the impairments as non-severe at step two. <em>Maziarz, </em>837 F.2d at 244. We thus reverse the district court\u2019s contrary conclusion on this point.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-4\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-5\">The district court also determined that the ALJ committed procedural error in the remaining steps of its analysis by insufficiently accounting for the medical opinion of Dr. Anil Agarwal, a treating physician. As to that, we agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-6\">The opinions of treating physicians generally receive considerable, though not always controlling, weight. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1527(d)(2). The ALJ must \u201cgive good reasons in [his] notice of determination or decision for the weight [it] give[s][a] treating source\u2019s opinion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>When an ALJ does not give controlling weight to a treating physician, the ALJ \u201cmust\u201d consider a number of factors, including the length of the treatment relationship, frequency of examination, nature and extent of the treatment relationship, supportability of the opinion, consistency with the record as a whole and any specialization of the treating source. <em>Wilson v. Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec., </em>378 F.3d 541, 544 (6th Cir.2004); <em>see also </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1527(d)(2). The ALJ\u2019s explanation \u201cmust be sufficiently specific to make clear to any subsequent reviewers the weight the adjudicator gave to the treating source\u2019s medical opinion and the reasons for that weight.\u201d Soc. Sec. Rui. 96-2p, 1996 WL 374188, at *5. When an ALJ fails to follow these procedural rules, we will reverse and remand unless the error is harmless. <em>See Wilson, </em>378 F.3d at 547.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-8\">Dr. Agarwal treated Fisk after he moved to Ohio in January 2003, referred Fisk to multiple specialists and completed two reports in October and November that noted Fisk\u2019s multiple diagnoses and that recommended significant limitations. In rejecting Dr. Agarwal\u2019s opinion, the ALJ stated that \u201cDr. Agarwal\u2019s opinion is not accepted as controlling, or even entitled to deferential weight, based on the lack of support from objective findings in the overall record.\u201d AR 25. The ALJ reasoned that Dr. Agarwal\u2019s recommended limitations were unsupported by the record because Fisk\u2019s arthritis was in the right knee only, because Fisk\u2019s cardiac evaluations were \u201cnegative for significant coronary disease\u201d and because the record \u201cdoes not document significant difficulty with ambulation or range of motion, motor strength, sensation, grip, or fine manipulation.\u201d AR 25.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-9\">The ALJ instead relied on the opinion of Dr. Archibald-Long, the physician who reviewed Fisk\u2019s file at the state agency\u2019s request in August 2002. In determining Fisk\u2019s residual functional capacity, the ALJ adopted Dr. Archibald-Long\u2019s recommended lifting restriction and agreed with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>Dr. Archibald-Long that \u201cthe record did not document end organ damage secondary to hypertension or diabetes, there was no physical evidence of severe motor, sensory, or neurological deficits, the claimant had normal gait and dexterity on examination, and cardiac catheterization did not show significant occlusion of critical arteries.\u201d AR 25.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-5\">Even if we assume for the sake of argument that the ALJ correctly determined that objective medical evidence does not support Dr. Agarwal\u2019s opinion, the ALJ\u2019s reason for rejecting the treating-physician opinion does not meet the agency\u2019s self-imposed procedural requirements. \u201c[A] finding that a treating source medical opinion ... is inconsistent with the other substantial evidence in the case record means only that the opinion is not entitled to \u2018controlling weight,\u2019 not that the opinion should be rejected,\u201d the agency has explained. Soc. Sec. Rul. 96-2p, 1996 WL 374188, at *4. \u201cTreating source medical opinions are still entitled to deference and <em>must be weighed using all of the factors provided in 20 CFR 404.1527 </em>____\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added). The regulations required the ALJ to consider the nature and extent of Fisk\u2019s treatment relationship with Dr. Agarwal, including \u201cthe kinds and extent of examinations and testing [that Dr. Agarwal] performed or ordered from specialists and independent laboratories.\u201d 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1527(d)(2)(ii); <em>see also </em>Soc. Sec. Rul. 96-2p, 1996 WL 374188, at *4.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-8\">The ALJ did not do this. He failed to recognize that Dr. Agarwal referred Fisk to at least five specialists for a variety of conditions: the Dayton Eye Associates for a diabetic eye evaluation; Dr. Hussain for a cardiac evaluation; Dr. Venkatash for a neurological consultation based on Fisk\u2019s upper extremity tremors; Dr. Mieczkowski for cholesterol testing at the Center for Cholesterol Treatment and Education; and Dr. Hawkins for polyarthralgias. The ALJ also failed to appreciate or at least acknowledge that Dr. Agarwal\u2019s opinion accounted for a year\u2019s worth of medical evidence that the earlier state physicians\u2019 reviews did not consider, such as stenosis of the arteries, AR 316, \u201c[a]typical chest pain,\u201d AR 333, a \u201ctrace tremor,\u201d AR 291, limited range of motion and \u201cprobable diabetic tendonopathy,\u201d AR 379, fatty liver and \u201csclerotic changes [that] may reflect chronic cuff disease,\u201d AR 363. Nothing in the ALJ\u2019s opinion indicates that he accounted for the \u201cnature and extent\u201d of Dr. Agarwal\u2019s treating relationship. Absent a \u201csufficiently specific\u201d explanation on this point, we cannot engage in meaningful review of the \u201creasons for [the] weight\u201d that the ALJ gave to Dr. Agarwal\u2019s opinion. Soc. Sec. Rul. 96-2p, 1996 WL 374188, at *5.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-10\">To be sure, the ALJ\u2019s decision to give greater weight to Dr. Archibald-Long\u2019s opinion was not, in and of itself, error. We recognize that \u201c[i]n appropriate circumstances, opinions from State agency medical ... consultants ... may be entitled to greater weight than the opinions of treating or examining sources.\u201d Soc. Sec. Rui. 96-6p, 1996 WL 374180, at *3. This may be true, for example, if \u201cthe State agency medical ... consultant\u2019s opinion is based on a review of a complete case record that ... provides more detailed and comprehensive information than what was available to the individual\u2019s treating source.\u201d <em>Id. </em>But where, as here, the <em>treating </em>source referred Fisk to numerous sources and made recommendations that accounted for a year\u2019s worth of specialists\u2019 opinions, we require some indication that the ALJ at least considered these facts before giving greater weight to an opinion that is not \u201cbased on a review of a complete case record.\u201d <em>Id.; see also </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1527(d)(2)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b612-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>There is, it is true, a narrow category of cases in which a <em>\u201cde minimis </em>\u201d procedural violation may constitute harmless error, such as when \u201ca treating source\u2019s opinion is so patently deficient that the Commissioner could not possibly credit it\u201d or where the Commissioner \u201chas met the goal of ... the procedural safeguard of reasons.\u201d <em>Wilson, </em>378 F.3d at 547. But this is not the \u201crare case\u201d where \u201cthe ALJ\u2019s analysis [met] the goal of the rule even if not ... its letter.\u201d <em>Nelson v. Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec., </em>195 Fed.Appx. 462, 472 (6th Cir.2006). We cannot engage in \u201c \u2018meaningful review\u2019 \u201d of the ALJ\u2019s decision, <em>id. </em>(quoting <em>Wilson, </em>378 F.3d at 544), because his reasoning is not \u201csufficiently specific to make clear\u201d that the ALJ realized the nature and extent of Dr. Agarwal\u2019s treating relationship, Soc. Sec. Rul. 96-2p, 1996 WL 374188, at *5.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-4\">Nor was Dr. Agarwal\u2019s recommendation \u201cso patently deficient that the Commissioner could not possibly credit it.\u201d <em>Wilson, </em>378 F.3d at 547. While Dr. Agaiwal would have done well to provide more explanation to support his recommendations, he supported his assessment by referencing his medical findings of \u201carthritis \u2014 knee, back and hands,\u201d \u201ctremors\u201d and \u201cvasovagal syncope.\u201d AR 343. To support his recommended physical function limitations on reaching, pushing and pulling and his recommended work-environment limitations, Dr. Agaiwal also noted that the \u201cpatient is at risk for falls [and] passing out. [P]atient has limited mobility.\u201d AR 344-45. He repeatedly wrote, moreover, \u201csee attached\u201d next to his explanation, leading the reader to 32 pages of supporting treatment records from his office as well as laboratory reports and specialists\u2019 assessments. <em>See </em>AR 347-78.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-5\">To the extent the Commissioner persists that substantial evidence nonetheless supports the ALJ\u2019s treatment of Dr. Agarwal\u2019s opinion, that is beside the point. \u201c[T]o recognize substantial evidence as a defense to non-compliance with \u00a7 1527(d)(2)[] would afford the Commissioner the ability [to] violate the regulation with impunity and render the protections promised therein illusory.\u201d <em>Wilson, </em>378 F.3d at 546.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-8\">For these reasons, we reverse the district court\u2019s assignment of error at step two, and we affirm the district court\u2019s decision to vacate the Commissioner\u2019s non-disability finding based on its treatment of Dr. Agarwal\u2019s opinion and remand to the agency for further consideration.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
