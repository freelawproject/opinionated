Delgado-Aguilar\u2019s counsel filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), stating that there are no meritorious claims for appeal, but raising the issue of whether Delgado-Aguilar\u2019s sentence was reasonable. Delgado-Aguilar was given an opportunity to file a supplemental pro se brief, but has declined to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-11\">This court reviews the imposition of a sentence for reasonableness. <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 260-61, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005); <em>United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540, 546-47 (4th Cir.2005). After <em>Booker, </em>courts must calculate the appropriate guidelines range, making any appropriate factual findings. <em>United States v. Davenport, </em>445 F.3d 366, 370 (4th Cir.2006). The court then considers the resulting advisory guidelines range in conjunction with the factors under 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(a) (West 2000 <em>&amp; </em>Supp. 2007), and determines an appropriate sentence. <em>Davenport, </em>445 F.3d at 370. This court will affirm a <em>post-Booker </em>sentence if it is within the statutorily prescribed range and is reasonable. <em>Hughes, </em>401 F.3d at 546-47. A sentence within the proper advisory guidelines range is presumptively reasonable. <em>United States v. Green, </em>436 F.3d 449, 457 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>-U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 2309, 164 L.Ed.2d 828 (2006); <em>see Rita v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b281-17\">At sentencing, Delgado-Aguilar did not object to the findings in his presentence report or to the sentencing guidelines range, which was calculated at 27 to 33 months. The district court imposed a variance sentence below the guidelines range, sentencing Delgado-Aguilar to twenty months\u2019 incarceration. The Government did not object to the variance. On appeal, Delgado-Aguilar has failed to demonstrate why his sentence is procedurally or substantively unreasonable. The district court correctly calculated the advisory guidelines range and considered the relevant factors under 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(a). Therefore, we find that the sentence imposed by the district court was not unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-18\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the record in this case and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. We therefore affirm Delgado-Aguilar\u2019s conviction and sentence. We deny counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw at this juncture. This court requires counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-4\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
