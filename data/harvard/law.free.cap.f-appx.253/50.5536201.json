Crosby, </em>397 F.3d 103 (2d Cir.2005). Forbes was convicted of: (1) conspiracy to distribute and possess with intent to distribute marijuana and 50 grams or more of cocaine base in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(b)(1)(A) and 846; and (2) the use of a minor to commit a drug trafficking crime in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 846 and 861(a)(1). He was sentenced principally to concurrent terms of life imprisonment, which fell within the applicable Sentencing Guideline range. We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the facts and procedural history of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-13\">Forbes contends that \u201cthe district court either failed to apply the Section 3553(a) factors, or that the district court gave priority to the Guidelines calculation in its consideration of the sentencing factors.\u201d We find no merit in Forbes\u2019s challenges to his sentence, which we review for reasonableness. <em>See United States v. Fernandez, </em>443 F.3d 19, 25-26 (2d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b77-15\">Here, the district court unambiguously stated in the April 12, 2006 order denying resentencing that it \u201cconsidered the various factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553\u201d and that \u201cit would not impose a sentence that is \u2018non-trivially different\u2019 from that previously imposed.\u201d Moreover, there is no indication in the record that the district court gave undue weight to the Guidelines in relation to the balance of other sentencing factors. While no longer mandatory, the Guidelines remain an important consideration in arriving at a fair sentence and have not been rendered \u201ca body of casual advice.\u201d <em>Crosby, </em>397 F.3d at 113; see <em>also Rita v. United States, </em>\u2014U.S.-, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2464-65, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007) (explaining that the Guidelines \u201cseek to embody the \u00a7 3553(a) considerations, both in principle and in practice ... [and] it is fair to assume that the Guidelines, insofar as practicable, reflect a rough approximation of sentences that might achieve \u00a7 3553(a)\u2019s objectives.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b77-18\">For the reasons discussed, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
