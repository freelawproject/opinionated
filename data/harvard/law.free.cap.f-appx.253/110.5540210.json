Korman, Judge of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b137-25\">SUMMARY ORDER</p>\n<p id=\"b137-26\">Constantine McLaughlin appeals from a judgment of conviction, dated March 14, 2006, principally sentencing McLaughlin to 10 years\u2019 imprisonment. We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the facts, the proceedings below, and the specification of issues on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-27\">While McLaughlin\u2019s challenges to the judgment of conviction are without merit, we note that the district court erred when it concluded that McLaughlin\u2019s statement to police was not a confession for purposes of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3501 because the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>statement was exculpatory.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Government used McLaughlin\u2019s statement against him, both because it established that he was on Staten Island on the day of the murder and because it established that he lied to the FBI about his activities that day. This use of McLaughlin\u2019s account made his statement \u201cself-incriminating,\u201d <em>id. </em>\u00a7 3501(e), even if he had not intended it to be so, and therefore satisfied the statutory definition of a confession.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-4\">Even if McLaughlin\u2019s statement was a confession, the district court did not err by failing to instruct the jury on voluntariness because that issue was never raised at trial. <em>See United States v. Fuentes, </em>563 F.2d 527, 535 (2d Cir.1977) (noting that an instruction on voluntariness under \u00a7 3501 is only mandated \u201cwhere an issue of voluntariness has in fact been raised at trial\u201d). Moreover, any error in failing to instruct the jury on voluntariness would not have been prejudicial, as the Government made limited use of McLaughlin\u2019s statement at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-5\">We have considered all of the defendant\u2019s other arguments and find them without merit. Accordingly, for the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b138-14\">. We presume without deciding that the portion of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3501(a) requiring the trial court in certain instances to instruct the jury on the issue of voluntariness survives <em>Dickerson v. United States, </em>530 U.S. 428, 120 S.Ct. 2326, 147 L.Ed.2d 405 (2000).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
