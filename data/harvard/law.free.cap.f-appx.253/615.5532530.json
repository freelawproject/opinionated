In a prior decision, we affirmed Urbina\u2019s conviction, and remanded for resentencing in light of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). On this appeal, in a brief filed under <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), Urbina\u2019s counsel challenges the length of Urbina\u2019s prison term, and makes a conclusory allegation that Urbina has been the victim of prosecutorial vindictiveness and selective law enforcement. In his pro se brief, Urbina contends that corruption pervaded every aspect of his criminal proceeding, and he focuses on the injustice of the denial of his motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-23\">Following careful review, we conclude that the district court did not impose an unreasonable sentence. <em>See United States v. Haack, </em>403 F.3d 997, 1003-04 (8th Cir.2005). Moreover, the denial of Urbina\u2019s motion to suppress was resolved against him during his first appeal, and he may not revisit the suppression ruling or any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>aspect of his conviction here. <em>See U.S. v. Urbina, </em>431 F.3d 305, 309-10 (8th Cir.2005); <em>United States v. Walterman, </em>408 F.3d 1084, 1086 (8th Cir.2005); <em>United States v. Behler, </em>187 F.3d 772, 776-77 (8th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b642-4\">After reviewing the record independently under <em>Penson v. Ohio, </em>488 U.S. 75, 109 S.Ct. 346, 102 L.Ed.2d 300 (1988), we have found no non-frivolous issues for appeal. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the district court, and we grant counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b641-15\">. The Honorable Richard E. Dorr, United States District Judge for the Western District of Missouri.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
