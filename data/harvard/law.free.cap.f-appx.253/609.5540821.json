He moved for a mistrial based on the government\u2019s failure to comply with a pre-trial production order and based on purported violations of \u201cGarrett\u2019s right to due process, the Jencks Act, <em>Brady v. Maryland, Giglio v. United States, </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 16, and the stipulated discovery order.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Brief at 5. It is undisputed that the government failed to comply with the stipulated discovery order in that the government disclosed certain prior statements by three government witnesses after the time allowed under the order, but before those witnesses testified against Garrett. The district court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> denied Garrett\u2019s motion for a mistrial, and Garrett appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-17\">We review for abuse of discretion the district court\u2019s discovery and evidentiary rulings. <em>United States v. Vieth, </em>397 F.3d 615, 617 (8th Cir.2005). We also review for abuse of discretion the district court\u2019s ruling on the motion for a mistrial. <em>United States v. Urqhart, </em>469 F.3d 745, 748 (8th Cir.2006). Notwithstanding Garrett\u2019s allegation of the government\u2019s numerous violations, Garrett has failed to articulate how any of the late-disclosed material was exculpatory under <em>Brady, </em>how the disclosures failed to satisfy the requirements of the Jencks Act, or how any actions by the government in this case caused prejudice to Garrett\u2019s defense. Garrett received all materials related to the three government witnesses before those witnesses testified, and on more than one occasion was granted the opportunity to question those witnesses outside the presence of the jury. Not only has Garrett failed to articulate how the government\u2019s actions caused prejudice, our review of the trial transcript convinces us that the district court correct<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>ly determined no prejudice occurred in this case. In light of this conclusion, we hold that the district court acted well within its discretion regarding the underlying discovery and evidentiary rulings and properly denied Garrett\u2019s motion for a mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-5\">The judgment of the district court is affirmed in accordance with Eighth Circuit Rule of Appellate Procedure 47B.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b636-15\">.
