Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). The district court properly considered the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors when imposing Sandoval\u2019s sentence. <em>See United States v. Gonzalez, </em>250 F.3d 923, 930 (5th Cir.2001). Sandoval\u2019s sentence, which was the statutory maximum, was neither unreasonable nor plainly unreasonable. <em>See </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number><em>United States v. Hinson, </em>429 F.3d 114, 120 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b412-4\">Sandoval also argues that the district court violated the Sixth Amendment when it revoked his release and imposed an additional prison term based on facts found only by a preponderance of the evidence. Sandoval acknowledges that this argument is foreclosed by <em>Hinson, </em>429 F.3d at 119, but raises it to preserve it for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b411-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
