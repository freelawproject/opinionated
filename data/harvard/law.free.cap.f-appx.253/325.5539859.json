The court sentenced him to 322 months\u2019 imprisonment. On appeal Taylor\u2019s counsel has filed a brief in accordance with <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), concluding that there are no meritorious issues for appeal. However, counsel states that Taylor has requested that he raise the following claims of ineffective assistance of counsel: (1) failure to thoroughly explain the import of the proceedings against him in that he has only a ninth grade education and did not fully understand the nature of the proceedings; (2) failure to interview several key witnesses; (3) coercing him to plead guilty to the charge of knowingly and unlawfully using and carrying a firearm in furtherance of a drug trafficking crime, a crime for which he is in fact innocent; and (4) refusing to assert his contention that the enhancement under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851 (2000) was improper as it was based upon an offense committed within the scope of the instant conspiracy. Taylor was advised of his right to file a pro se supplemental brief, but did not do so. Upon a thorough review of the record, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-7\">Claims of ineffective assistance of counsel must be brought in a collateral proceeding under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 (2000) unless it conclusively appears from the face of the record that appellant\u2019s counsel was ineffective. <em>See United States v. DeFusco, </em>949 F.2d 114, 120-21 (4th Cir.1991). We conclude that because the first three issues raised by Taylor require consideration of facts not contained in the existing record, they are not ripe for consideration on direct appeal. Taylor\u2019s claim that the enhancement under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851 (2000) was improper as it was based upon an offense committed within the scope of the instant conspiracy is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-9\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the record in this case and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. We therefore affirm Taylor\u2019s conviction and sentence. We deny counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw. This court requires that counsel inform Taylor, in writing, of the right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If Taylor requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may renew his motion at that time. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on Taylor. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-10\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
