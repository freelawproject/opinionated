He also appeals his 151-month sentence. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-21\">1. Reviewing de novo, <em>United States v. Nielsen, </em>371 F.Sd 574, 579 (9th Cir.2004), we hold that probable cause sup<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>ported the search warrant for the residence at 1310 Sharon Avenue, the arrest of Defendant, and the search of the red Jeep Cherokee. The facts alleged in the supporting affidavit indicated \u201ca fair probability that contraband or evidence of a crime\u201d would be found at the residence, <em>United States v. Diaz, </em>491 F.3d 1074, 1078 (9th Cir.2007) (internal quotation marks omitted), \u201ca \u2018fair probability5 that [Defendant] ha[d] committed a crime,\u201d <em>United States v. Hartz, </em>458 F.3d 1011, 1018 (9th Cir.2006), and a fair probability that the red Jeep Cherokee had been used \u201cin a[ ] manner to facilitate the transportation, sale, receipt, possession, or concealment of [controlled substances],\u201d 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 881(a)(4); <em>see Florida v. White, </em>526 U.S. 559, 563, 119 S.Ct. 1555, 143 L.Ed.2d 748 (1999) (holding that a search of a vehicle is warranted where probable cause exists that a violation of a civil forfeiture law such as 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 881 has occurred).</p>\n<p id=\"b740-4\">2. Reviewing the record de novo, we hold that Defendant voluntarily waived his <em>Miranda </em>rights. <em>See United States v. Amano, </em>229 F.3d 801, 803-05 (9th Cir.2000) (establishing standard of proof and listing the relevant factors).</p>\n<p id=\"b740-5\">3. The district court did not abuse its discretion by commenting on the evidence. <em>See White v. City of Norwalk, </em>900 F.2d 1421, 1426 (9th Cir.1990) (\u201c[A] trial judge may comment on the evidence, \u2018but he may not either distort it or add to it.\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Quercia v. United States, </em>289 U.S. 466, 469-70, 53 S.Ct. 698, 77 L.Ed. 1321 (1933))).</p>\n<p id=\"b740-6\">4. The district court did not abuse its discretion by denying Defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial on account of alleged prosecutorial misconduct, because the prosecutor\u2019s comments were only slightly improper, if improper at all, and the judge quickly issued a curative instruction to the jury. <em>See United States v. Younger, </em>398 F.3d 1179, 1192 (9th Cir.2005) (holding that a curative statement can suffice to correct any potential effect on the verdict); <em>United States v. Murillo, </em>288 F.3d 1126, 1140 (9th Cir.2002) (stating the standard of review).</p>\n<p id=\"b740-8\">5. The district court did not plainly err by failing to declare a mistrial after a witness referred to \u201cthe people in the tank.\u201d <em>See United States v. Geston, </em>299 F.3d 1130, 1134 (9th Cir.2002) (stating the plain error standard of review when the defendant does not object at trial). In context, that comment neither clearly referred to prison staff nor clearly referred to Defendant\u2019s incarceration. <em>Cf. United States v. Allen, </em>425 F.3d 1231, 1236 (9th Cir.2005), <em>cert. denied, </em>547 U.S. 1012, 126 S.Ct. 1487, 164 L.Ed.2d 263 (2006) (finding no abuse of discretion in a case in which a witness clearly referred to the defendant\u2019s incarceration).</p>\n<p id=\"b740-9\">6. The district court did not plainly err by allowing the prosecutor\u2019s statements during closing argument concerning Plaintiffs testimony about the truck. <em>See Geston, </em>299 F.3d at 1134-35 (stating the standard of review).</p>\n<p id=\"b740-10\">7. The district court did not abuse its discretion by admitting evidence under Federal Rule of Evidence 404(b) that a small amount of methamphetamine was found during the search of Defendant\u2019s Jeep, because possession of methamphetamine can be used to prove Defendant\u2019s knowledge of methamphetamine. <em>United States v. Ramirez-Robles, </em>386 F.3d 1234, 1242-43 (9th Cir.2004). Even if the district court did err, though, any error was harmless. The evidence of the methamphetamine in the Jeep played only a very small role in the government\u2019s case, and \u201cit is more probable than not that the erroneous admission of the evidence did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>not affect the jury\u2019s verdict.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1244 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b741-5\">8. The district court erred by allowing testimony under Federal Rule of Evidence 106 \u201cbecause no writing or recorded statement was introduced by a party[,] ... [the] out-of-court statements ... do not fall within an exception to the hearsay rule, ... [and] there was no concern in this case that [Defendant] introduced a misleadingly-tailored snippet.\u201d <em>United States v. Collicott, </em>92 F.3d 973, 983 (9th Cir.1996) (footnotes and citations omitted). But the error was harmless because we do not have \u201cgrave doubt whether the erroneously admitted evidence substantially affected the verdict.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 984. Unlike in <em>Collicott, </em>the underlying facts in the improperly admitted evidence had been introduced properly through the testimony of two different witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-6\">9. The cumulative error, if any, was harmless. <em>See United States v. Fernandez, </em>388 F.3d 1199, 1256-57 (9th Cir.2004) (stating that the cumulative effect of all errors must be examined for harmlessness), <em>modified, </em>425 F.3d 1248 (9th Cir.2005). The prosecution\u2019s case against Defendant was strong, and the cumulative error was minor. <em>See United States v. Frederick, </em>78 F.3d 1370, 1381 (9th Cir.1996) (holding that the stronger the prosecution\u2019s case against Defendant, the greater the cumulative error must be to warrant reversal).</p>\n<p id=\"b741-7\">10. Reviewing de novo, <em>United States v. Shetty, </em>130 F.3d 1324, 1333 (9th Cir.1997), we hold that the district court properly granted a two-point enhancement for obstruction of justice under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1. Defendant pleaded guilty under the original indictment but failed to appear for sentencing and remained at large for a year. <em>See United States v. Petersen, </em>98 F.3d 502, 508 (9th Cir.1996) (holding that willful failure to appear at sentencing supported obstruction of justice enhancement). We reject Defendant\u2019s argument that the government\u2019s filing of a superseding indictment to correct an erroneous date somehow alters the analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b739-12\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
