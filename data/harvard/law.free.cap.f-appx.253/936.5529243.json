Richard Schulte petitions for review of the final decision of the Merit Systems Protection Board (\u201cBoard\u201d) that sustained the action of Mr. Schulte\u2019s employer, the Department of the Air Force (\u201cAir Force\u201d), indefinitely suspending him from his position pending an investigation relating to his security clearance. <em>Schulte v. Dep\u2019t of the Air Force, </em>DE-0752-03-0403-1-4, 105 M.S.P.R. 558 (M.S.P.B. Apr. 9, 2007) <em>(\u201cFinal Decision </em>\u201d). We <em>affirm.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b963-18\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b963-19\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b963-20\">Prior to his indefinite suspension, Mr. Schulte worked as a Communications-Computer Systems Specialist in the 4th Space Operations Squadron at Schriever Air Force Base in El Paso County, Colorado. In order to hold this position, Mr. Schulte was required to have a Top Secret Security Clearance.</p>\n<p id=\"b963-21\">On September 23, 2002, the Air Force informed Mr. Schulte that it had commenced an investigation concerning alleged misconduct on his part. As a consequence of this investigation, the Air Force also commenced an investigation concerning Mr. Schulte\u2019s security clearance. On January 15, 2003, the Air Force informed Mr. Schulte that it proposed to suspend him without pay indefinitely pending the investigation relating to his security clearance.</p>\n<p id=\"b963-22\">Mr. Schulte was given in excess of sixty days in which to respond to his proposed suspension. During this period, Mr. Schulte requested additional information, which it appears the Air Force provided. Finally, on June 19, 2003, the Air Force issued a decision letter that placed Mr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"938\">*938</page-number>Schulte on indefinite suspension commencing on June 26, 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b964-4\">After the issuance of the decision letter, Mr. Schulte appealed his suspension to the Board three times, which each time dismissed the case without prejudice so as to permit completion of the security clearance investigation. Eventually, on October 17, 2006, the administrative judge (\u201cAJ\u201d) to whom the appeal was assigned issued an initial decision upholding Mr. Schulte\u2019s indefinite suspension. <em>Schulte v. Dep\u2019t of the Air Force, </em>DE-0752-03-0403-I-4 (M.S.P.B. Oct 17, 2006) <em>(\u201cInitial Decision </em>\u201d). The AJ determined that the Air Force had properly justified the decision to suspend Mr. Schulte pending the adjudication of his security clearance. <em>Id. </em>at 5. Citing <em>Jones v. Department of the Navy, </em>48 M.S.P.R. 680 (1991), for the proposition that an agency may indefinitely suspend an employee while investigating a security clearance if the agency believes that retention of the employee would compromise governmental interests, <em>id. </em>at 689-90, the AJ found that the Air Force had ample reason to suspend Mr. Schulte and that he was given sufficient opportunity to respond to the proposed suspension. <em>Initial Decision </em>at 2. The initial decision became the final decision of the Board on April 9, 2007, when the Board denied Mr. Schulte\u2019s petition for review for failure to meet the criteria for review set forth at 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 1201.115(d). <em>Final Decision. </em>This appeal followed. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1295(a)(9).</p>\n<p id=\"b964-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b964-6\">Our scope of review in an appeal from a decision of the Board is limited. Specifically, we must affirm the Board\u2019s decision unless we find it to be \u201carbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law\u201d; \u201cobtained without procedures required by law, rule, or regulation having been followed\u201d; or \u201cunsupported by substantial evidence.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7703(c) (2000); <em>see Kewley v. Dep\u2019t of Health &amp; Human Servs., </em>153 F.3d 1357, 1361 (Fed.Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b964-8\">In a case involving an adverse personnel action based upon the suspension of a security clearance, our review is limited to determining (i) whether a security clearance was a requirement of the appellant\u2019s position; (ii) whether, if it was, the security clearance was suspended or denied; and (iii) whether the procedures set forth in 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7513 were followed. <em>Hesse v. Dep\u2019t of State, </em>217 F.3d 1372, 1376 (Fed.Cir.2000). In addition, we may not review the underlying merits of the security clearance determination. <em>Dep\u2019t of the Navy v. Egan, </em>484 U.S. 518, 530, 108 S.Ct. 818, 98 L.Ed.2d 918 (1988); <em>Hesse, </em>217 F.3d at 1376.</p>\n<p id=\"b964-9\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b964-10\">On appeal, Mr. Schulte contends that the Board improperly failed to consider his status as a whistleblower, wrongly failed to consider the Colorado Uniform Commercial Code, and incorrectly applied 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7513. He also contends that the Board erred in its fact finding. We address these contentions in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b964-11\">With respect to whistleblowing, Mr. Schulte essentially argues that the Air Force improperly revoked his security clearance in retaliation for protected activity. The short answer to this argument is that we rejected a similar claim in <em>Hesse, </em>where we stated that neither we nor the Board is authorized to review an employee\u2019s claims that he or she has been denied a security clearance in retaliation for whistleblowing. 217 F.3d at 1380. We thus reject Mr. Schulte\u2019s argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b964-12\">We also reject Mr. Schulte\u2019s Colorado Uniform Commercial Code argument. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"939\">*939</page-number>The Uniform Commercial Code is irrelevant to the case at hand, wherein our scope of review is limited to determining whether a security clearance was suspended and whether the procedural requirements of 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7513 were met. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b965-5\">As far as the requirements of 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7513 are concerned, Mr. Schulte has failed to establish how the requirements of the statute were not met. Mr. Schulte was given roughly five months advance notice of his suspension, over sixty days in which to respond to the proposed action, the opportunity to retain counsel if he wished, and an adequate description of the nature of the charges against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-6\">Finally, toning to the Board\u2019s findings of fact, Mr. Schulte contends that the Board failed to find that his \u201cemployment contract\u201d did not refer to the <em>Egan </em>decision, which he ostensibly believes was necessary in order to apprise him of the standard of review applicable to indefinite suspensions. He also contends that the Board wrongfully ignored evidence establishing his status as a whistleblower. In addition, he faults the Board for failure to consider that the Air Force had not completed its security clearance investigation at the time of the AJ\u2019s initial decision. And lastly, he urges that the Board erred in its failure to consider his lack of gainful employment during his indefinite suspension pending the adjudication of his security clearance. None of these contentions has merit.</p>\n<p id=\"AnC\">First, with respect to the alleged failure of Mr. Schulte\u2019s \u201cemployment contract\u201d to mention <em>Egan, </em>there simply is no law that requires an agency, prior to hiring, to provide an employee with a statement of all of the case law that may become relevant during an adverse action.</p>\n<p id=\"As-\">Secondly, as far as the Board\u2019s failure to adjudicate Mr. Schulte\u2019s whistleblower status is concerned, we already have noted that, under <em>Hesse, </em>the Board was not authorized to consider any whistleblowing activity on Mr. Schulte\u2019s part.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-9\">Mr. Schulte\u2019s third argument appears to contest the propriety of an indefinite suspension pending the adjudication of a security clearance. However, as we noted in <em>Jones v. Department of the Navy, </em>978 F.2d 1223 (Fed.Cir.1992), an indefinite suspension is justifiable so long as the length thereof is necessary to enable full investigation with respect to the revocation of the security clearance, <em>id. </em>at 1227.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-10\">Finally, Mr. Schulte cites no legal authority for the proposition that the Board was required to consider his lack of income during the period of his suspension, and we know of no such authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-11\">We have considered Mr. Schulte\u2019s other arguments and have found them to be without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-12\">For the foregoing reasons, the final decision of the Board is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-13\">No costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
