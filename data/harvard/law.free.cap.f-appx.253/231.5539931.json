(Sym-Tech) appeals the District Court\u2019s order partially remanding to state court a complaint filed by Appellees George Cowatch (Cowatch) and Impact Marketing, Inc. (Impact). Sym-Tech argues that the District Court erred by: (1) finding that Sym-Tech unambiguously waived its right to federal jurisdiction in a forum selection clause; and (2) refusing to consider extrinsic evidence proffered by Sym-Tech to show that it did not intend to waive its right to federal jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-13\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-14\">Our review of the District Court\u2019s construction of the forum selection clause is plenary. <em>Foster v. Chesapeake Ins. Co., </em>933 F.2d 1207, 1216 (3d Cir.1991). We determine contractual waiver of federal jurisdiction using the same benchmarks of construction as we employ in resolving all preliminary contractual questions. <em>Id. </em>at 1217 n. 15. We ascertain the intent of the parties to a written agreement from the writing itself, and where the words contained in the agreement are clear and unambiguous, we enforce them. <em>Martin v. Monumental Ins. Co., </em>240 F.3d 223, 232-33 (3d Cir.2001). We will consider extrinsic evidence only where the language of the agreement itself is ambiguous. <em>Mellon Bank, N.A. v. Aetna Bus. Credit, Inc., </em>619 F.2d 1001, 1010 n. 9 (3d Cir.1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b258-15\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-16\">Because we write for the parties, we repeat only the facts essential to our decision. Sym-Tech, a Canadian corporation, alleges that it entered into an exclusive distributorship agreement with Cowatch and Impact, both citizens of Pennsylvania, under which Sym-Tech would be the sole Canadian distributor of a corrosion control device patented by Cowatch. Cowatch and Impact deny that any exclusive distributorship agreement was ever signed, but it is undisputed that the parties entered \u25a0 into non-disclosure/non-compete agreement, which stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b258-17\">THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT WILL BE INTERPRETED ACCORDING TO THE LAWS OF THE COMMONWEALTH OF PENNSYLVANIA AND ANY DIS<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>PUTES FROM THIS AGREEMENT WILL BE SETTLED IN AN APPROPRIATE COURT OF COMPETENT JURISDICTION IN THE COMMONWEALTH OF PENNSYLVANIA.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ap8\">SYM-TECH HEREBY ACKNOWLEDGES AND CONSENTS TO THE JURISDICTION OF SAID COURT OR COURTS AND HEREBY WAIVES ANY RIGHTS REGARDING DIVERSITY OF JURISDICTION PERTAINING TO THIS MATTER.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">After Cowatch and Impact entered into distribution agreements with other companies in Canada, Sym-Tech brought suit in Canada for breach of the alleged exclusive distributorship agreement. Cowatch and Sym-Tech responded with a patent infringement action in Canada, and also filed a complaint against Sym-Tech in the Court of Common Pleas of Clarion County, Pennsylvania, asserting claims for tortious interference with contract and requesting injunctive relief and a declaratory judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-6\">Sym-Tech removed the case to the District Court on the basis of diversity jurisdiction, and filed counterclaims for breach of contract, breach of fiduciary duty, tortious interference, negligent and fraudulent misrepresentation, and unjust enrichment. Cowatch and Impact filed a motion to remand to the Court of Common Pleas, relying upon the forum selection clause in the Non-Disclosure/Non-Compete Agreement. The District Court granted the motion to remand in part, finding that the contractual waiver provision was enforceable but was limited only to those claims arising out of the non-disclosure/non-compete agreement. Accordingly, it remanded Count I (seeking injunctive relief) in its entirety and Count III (tortious interference) to the extent it arose out of the nondisclosure/non-compete agreement, and retained the balance of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-8\">As a preliminary matter, we must address Appellees\u2019 contention that 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447(d), which provides that remand orders of a district court are \u201cnot renewable on appeal or otherwise,\u201d deprives this Court of jurisdiction. In <em>Foster, </em>we found that a remand order pursuant to a valid forum selection clause was not immune from review under \u00a7 1447(d). In so doing, we relied upon well-established Supreme Court precedent holding that \u00a7 1447(d) applies only to remand orders issued pursuant to \u00a7 1447(c). <em>Foster, </em>933 F.2d at 1210 (citing <em>Thermtron Prods., Inc. v. Hermansdorfer, </em>423 U.S. 336, 346, 96 S.Ct. 584, 46 L.Ed.2d 542 (1976)). Because \u00a7 1447(c) applied only to remand orders \u201con the basis of any defect in remand procedure,\u201d and a forum selection clause was not a procedural defect, \u00a7 1447(d) did not bar review. <em>Id. </em>We also held that a remand order pursuant to a forum selection clause is \u201cfinal\u201d for the purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 under the collateral order doctrine. <em>Id. </em>at 1211.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-9\">Appellees suggest that the 1996 amendment to \u00a7 1447(c), which bars review of \u201cany defect other than a lack of subject matter jurisdiction,\u201d not merely \u201cany defect in remand procedure,\u201d broadens the scope of the prohibition on review and effectively overturns our holding in <em>Foster. </em>But we rejected this argument in <em>Cook v. Wikler, </em>320 F.3d 431 (3d Cir.2003). Although we acknowledged that the 1996 amendment \u201crenders obsolete a certain amount of discussion in some of our prior decisions,\u201d we also observed that most of the <em>results </em>in the prior decisions \u201cappear unaffected by this statutory change because \u00a7 1447(d) still only precludes appellate review of remand orders based on a \u2018defect.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 435 n. 5. Thus, the amendment does not limit review of re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>mands \u201cfor which there is no \u2018authority in ... the controlling statute,\u2019 \u201d such as <em>sua sponte </em>remands, remands motivated by an overcrowded docket, remands on the basis of abstention or, critical to the instant case, remands pursuant to forum selection clauses. <em>Id. </em>(listing <em>Foster </em>as part of \u201clarge body of case law\u201d undisturbed by amendment). Accordingly, we have jurisdiction to entertain Sym-Tech\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-4\">Turning to the merits, we find that the District Court did not err when it found that Sym-Tech unambiguously waived its right to a federal forum. We agree with Sym-Tech that the phrase \u201ca court of competent jurisdiction in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania\u201d could include federal as well as state courts and the phrase \u201ccourt or courts\u201d suggests that a federal forum is not entirely foreclosed. But the last sentence of the provision, in which Sym-Tech waives \u201cany rights regarding diversity of jurisdiction pertaining to this matter,\u201d makes it clear that SymTech agreed to waive federal diversity jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">We are unpersuaded by Sym-Tech\u2019s suggestion that the use of the phrase \u201cdiversity of jurisdiction\u201d as opposed to \u201cdiversity of <em>citizenship </em>jurisdiction\u201d renders the provision ambiguous. Both phrases are commonly understood to refer to federal diversity jurisdiction. Indeed, this Court has at times used the phrases interchangeably. <em>See, e.g., Boyer v. Snap-On Tools Corp., </em>913 F.2d 108, 111 (3d Cir.1990); <em>Steel Valley Auth. v. Union Switch and Signal Div., </em>809 F.2d 1006, 1012 n. 6 (3d Cir.1987). Moreover, Sym-Tech\u2019s proffered interpretation \u2014 that \u201cdiversity of jurisdiction\u201d refers to any rights it might have to a Canadian forum \u2014 bolsters our conclusion that the District Court did not err in finding the operative language susceptible of only one reasonable interpretation. The first sentence of the provision provides that all disputes would be resolved within the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, so we reject summarily SymTech\u2019s suggestion that it retained a right to a Canadian forum under the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-7\">For the foregoing reasons, we will affirm the judgment below.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
