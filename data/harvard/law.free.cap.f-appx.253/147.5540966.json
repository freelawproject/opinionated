Hurd, Judge), entered on January 13, 2006 sentencing him on a guilty plea principally to 30 months\u2019 imprisonment for one count of possession of firearms by a convicted felon in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the balance of the facts, procedural history, and issues on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-18\">Spellicy first argues that his right to a speedy trial, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3162, was violated and that the indictment should therefore be dismissed. Findings of fact as they relate to a speedy trial challenge are reviewed for clear error and related legal conclusions <em>de novo. United States v. Gaskin, </em>364 F.3d 438, 450 (2d Cir.2004), <em>cert. denied, </em>544 U.S. 990, 125 S.Ct. 1878, 161 L.Ed.2d 751 (2005). The Speedy Trial Act \u201cgenerally requires a trial to begin within 70 days of the filing of an information or indictment or the defendant\u2019s initial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>appearance, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3161(c)(1), but the Act recognizes that criminal cases vary widely and that there are valid reasons for greater delay in particular cases.\u201d <em>Zedner v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 1976, 1983, 164 L.Ed.2d 749 (2006). Section 3161(h)(8) permits a court to grant a continuance, and exclude the resulting delay, if the court finds that the ends of justice are served by granting the continuance and that they outweigh the public\u2019s and the defendant\u2019s interests in a speedy trial. <em>Id. </em>at 1984.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-7\">Spellicy contends that the District Court\u2019s exclusion of time between August 11, 2005 and September 19, 2005 (the date on which Spellicy filed pretrial motions),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> was invalid because it indicated that Spellicy was the movant and that it was a stipulation, both of which were untrue. The exclusion may be made on the court\u2019s own motion or on a motion by the government or defendant, thus it is irrelevant whether defendant was the movant or whether the parties stipulated to the exclusion. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3161(h)(8).</p>\n<p id=\"b175-8\">However, Spellicy argues that those inaccuracies render any findings of fact in the order insufficient to satisfy the standard in <em>Zedner, </em>126 S.Ct. at 1989. This argument is unavailing. Though incorrectly titled a stipulation, the District Court\u2019s order excluding time from August 11, 2005 to and including September 28, 2005, pursuant to section 3161(h), stated that the ends of justice would be served by the exclusion. As reasons, the order signed by the District Court relied on the facts that a superceding indictment had been filed against Spellicy, Spellicy had just exercised his right to proceed <em>pro se, </em>and Spellicy expressed a desire to file pre-trial motions. All of these reasons were true and known to the District Court when it signed the order. Though those facts were erroneously cited as stipulated, they are entirely proper reasons for the exclusion of time. Thus, it was not error for the District Court to deny Spelliey\u2019s motion to dismiss based on a violation of the Speedy Trial Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-13\">Spellicy\u2019s second argument is that the search of his home violated his Fourth Amendment right against unreasonable search and seizure. \u201cTo be valid under the Fourth Amendment a search warrant must be supported by probable cause.\u201d <em>United States v. Irving, </em>452 F.3d 110, 125 (2d Cir.2006). The judicial officer\u2019s determination of probable cause is entitled to substantial deference, <em>see Illinois v. Gates, </em>462 U.S. 213, 236, 103 S.Ct. 2317, 76 L.Ed.2d 527 (1983), and our review is limited to \u201cwhether the issuing judicial officer had a substantial basis for the finding of probable cause.\u201d <em>United States v. Singh, </em>390 F.3d 168, 181 (2d Cir.2004). We review a district court\u2019s ruling on a suppression motion <em>de novo. United States v. Elmore, </em>482 F.3d 172, 178 (2d Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b175-14\">In deciding whether probable cause exists, a judicial officer must examine the totality of the circumstances. <em>Gates, </em>462 U.S. at 238, 103 S.Ct. 2317. \u201cThe core question in assessing probable cause based upon information supplied by an informant is whether the information is reliable. Information may be sufficiently reliable to support a probable cause finding if the person providing the information has a track record of providing reliable information, or if it is corroborated in material respects by independent evidence.\u201d <em>United States v. Wagner, </em>989 F.2d 69, 72-73 (2d Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b176-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>Here the town justice clearly had a substantial basis for a finding of probable cause. David Kashmer, Spellicy\u2019s neighbor, told police that he saw Spellicy moving rifles from his truck into his garage. The police investigator then personally met with Kashmer to obtain the information, had Kashmer sign a sworn affidavit, and corroborated Spellicy\u2019s address as well as Kashmer\u2019s claim that Spellicy was a convicted felon.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-4\">There is no allegation or indication that the police knew about and failed to include information regarding Kashmer\u2019s prior \u201cunfounded\u201d complaint that a marijuana smell was emanating from Spellicy\u2019s house. <em>See United States v. Ferguson, </em>758 F.2d 843, 848 (2d Cir.1985) (\u201cTo successfully challenge a search warrant based on the allegations set forth in the underlying affidavit, an objectant must show by a preponderance of the evidence that the affidavit contained false statements that were material on the issue of probable cause. The statements alleged to be false must be shown to have been made intentionally, knowingly, or with reckless disregard for the truth.\u201d) (citing <em>Franks v. Delaware, </em>438 U.S. 154, 98 S.Ct. 2674, 57 L.Ed.2d 667 (1978)). Nor is there reason to believe that inclusion of that \u201cunfounded\u201d complaint in the report would have made a finding of probable cause erroneous. Sufficiently reliable information was present in Kashmer\u2019s later tip to overcome any doubt that could have been created by the fact that Kashmer\u2019s earlier complaint was \u201cunfounded.\u201d <em>See Singh, </em>390 F.3d at 182.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-5\">Finally, we cannot say that the District Court erred in denying Spellicy\u2019s suppression motion based on the finding of good cause for a nighttime search. The nighttime search was reasonably authorized under the \u201cgood cause\u201d exception of Rule 41(e)(2) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure and its state law analogue, because the town justice found that firearms, rifles, or ammunition \u201ccould be easily disposed of.\u201d <em>See </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 41(e)(2); N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law \u00a7 690.35(4)(b)(i).</p>\n<p id=\"b176-7\">For these reasons, we AFFIRM the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b175-9\">. After Spellicy filed his pretrial motions, the time between the filing of the motions and denial was automatically excludable pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3161(h)(1)(F). See <em>Henderson v. United States, </em>476 U.S. 321, 330, 106 S.Ct. 1871, 90 L.Ed.2d 299 (1986).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
