In January 2006, Clime filed the instant complaint against Sunwest PEO, CNA ClaimPlus, Inc. and the Arias Law Firm (\u201cArias\u201d), appearing to allege: (1) racial discrimination, retaliation, and a hostile work environment, pursuant to Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (\u201cTitle VII\u201d), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2000e-2, 3; (2) unlawful misconduct and negligence by Arias; and (3) violations of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1981, 1982, and 1985 for \u201ccompiration,\u201d retaliation, and obstruction of justice. The district court adopted a magistrate judge\u2019s report recommending that Clime\u2019s action be dismissed for failure to state a claim and for failure to comply with its order to file an amended complaint in compliance with the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-24\">On appeal, Clime states, in his statement of material issues, that the district court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"806\">*806</page-number>erred by issuing \u201csummary judgment\u201d against him because he presented sufficient evidence to create a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the defendants violated the \u201cEPPA,\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> retaliated against him, engaged in misconduct, or were negligent. Clime also provides the standard of review for granting summary judgment. Clime then attempts to use his Blue Brief to file an amended complaint in compliance with the court\u2019s orders below, with attached exhibits, and a \u201ccounterclaim\u201d against Arias.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-4\">A district court\u2019s dismissal for failure to state a claim, pursuant to \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii), is reviewed <em>de novo, </em>using the same standards that govern Fed. R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6) dismissals. See <em>Mitchell v. Farcass, </em>112 F.3d 1483, 1490 (11th Cir.1997). Section 1915(e) provides, <em>inter alia, </em>that any <em>in forma pauperis </em>action or appeal shall be dismissed at any time if it fails to state a claim for which relief may be granted. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B). Although a plaintiff is not held to a very high standard in a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim, the federal rules do require \u201ca short and plain statement\u201d of the claim that will give the defendant fair notice of what the plaintiffs claim is and the grounds upon which it rests. See Fed. R.Civ.P. 8(a); <em>Roe v. Aware Woman Ctr. for Choice, Inc., </em>253 F.3d 678, 683 (11th Cir.2001). While notice pleading does not require the complainant to allege a fact to cover every element of a claim, \u201cit is still necessary that a complaint contain either direct or inferential allegations respecting all the material elements necessary to sustain a recovery under some viable legal theory.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotations and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b832-7\">Upon review of the pleadings, and Clime\u2019s brief, we find no reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-8\">As an initial matter, because Clime raises no argument regarding the court\u2019s finding that he failed to state a claim, he has abandoned this argument on appeal. See <em>Irwin v. Hawk, </em>40 F.3d 347, 347 n. 1 (11th Cir.1994) (noting that <em>pro se </em>litigant abandons issue by failing to challenge it on appeal); <em>Greenbriar, Ltd. v. City of Alabaster, </em>881 F.2d 1570, 1573 n. 6 (11th Cir.1989) (deeming issue waived where party fails to include substantive argument and only makes passing reference to the order appealed from). In any event, because Clime appeared, at most, to make conclusory and vague allegations, and his complaint was largely incoherent, the district court did not err by dismissing his complaint for failure to state a claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-9\">AFFIRMED.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b832-5\">. He may be referring to the Employee Polygraph Protection Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 2002(1), although he did not appear to allege a violation of this Act in his complaint.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b832-19\">.
