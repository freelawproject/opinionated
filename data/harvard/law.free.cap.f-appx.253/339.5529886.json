Mitchell appeals the district court\u2019s dismissal, for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction, of his suit seeking $2,246.00 and nonpecuniary relief because of Dr. Clinkseales\u2019s alleged failure to perform <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>oral surgery as promised. We have reviewed de novo the district court\u2019s reasons and judgment, the record, and Mitchell\u2019s brief and find no error in the district court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-4\">\u201c[Fjederal courts are ... empowered to hear only those cases that are within the constitutional grant of judicial power, and that have been entrusted to them by ... Congress.\u201d <em>Sarmiento v. Texas Bd. of Veterinary Med. Examiners By and Through Avery, </em>939 F.2d 1242, 1245 (5th Cir.1991). Subject-matter jurisdiction exists if a suit arises under the Constitution, laws, or treaties of the United States or arises between parties of diverse citizenship. <em>Arbaugh v. Y &amp; H Corp., </em>546 U.S. 500, 126 S.Ct. 1235, 1238, 163 L.Ed.2d 1097 (2006). The burden of pleading and proving subject-matter jurisdiction is on the party invoking federal jurisdiction. <em>Gassie v. SMH Swiss Corp., </em>165 F.3d 23 (5th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">The complaint contains no allegation that Mitchell and Clinkscales are citizens of different states; thus, Mitchell failed to plead and establish subject-matter jurisdiction based on the existence of complete diversity. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332. Additionally, although Mitchell argues that Clinkscales is liable under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, Mitchell does not allege facts demonstrating that Clinkscales acted under color of state law; thus, Mitchell failed to plead and establish subject-matter jurisdiction based on the existence of a federal question. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-6\">The district court was required to dismiss the complaint. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(h)(3). Because Mitchell failed to raise an issue of arguable merit in this court, this appeal is dismissed as frivolous. <em>See McGrew v. Rodriguez, </em>47 F.3d 425 (1995); 5th Cir. R. 42.2. Mitchell\u2019s motion for appointment of counsel is denied. Additionally, we take notice of our decisions in <em>Mitchell v. Bilby-Knight, </em>No. 95-40185, 1995 WL 337722 (5th Cir. May 17, 1995) (unpublished), and <em>Mitchell v. Owens, </em>No. 94-40166, 1995 WL 337746 (5th Cir. May 18, 1995) (unpublished), which dismissed Mitchell\u2019s appeals as frivolous. We also notice that in the instant action Mitchell certified to the district court that he had not previously been issued a sanction warning, a certification revealed to be false by our decision in <em>Bilby-Knight. </em>Mitchell is warned that the presentation of further frivolous actions will result in the imposition of sanctions, including monetary penalties and restrictions on his ability to seek relief in this court or in any court subject to our jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-8\">APPEAL DISMISSED; MOTION DENIED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b365-20\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
