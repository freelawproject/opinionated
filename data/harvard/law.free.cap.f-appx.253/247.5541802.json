Their appeals have been consolidated. Schenck was sentenced to 70 months incarceration and Walker to 57 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-24\">On September 2, 2005, Schenck entered a bank and handed the teller a plastic bag along with a note stating, \u201cPut all money in the bag nobody will get hurt or you die.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>After the teller handed him some money, Schenck left the bank and handed the money to Walker, who had been waiting outside. The two then split up in an effort to foil any pursuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-4\">In calculating the applicable Guidelines range for both defendants, the District Court added a two point enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(2)(F) for a threat of death. Defendants appeal only the threat of death enhancement. They argue that a reasonable person would not be put in fear of death by the demand note because Schenck was \u201cvisibly intoxicated and noticeably homeless\u201d and that their argument is supported by the teller\u2019s testimony that she did not really believe that Schenck\u2019s demand was real. We conclude that the District Court did not err in its ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">We have held that the test for application of the threat of death enhancement is the effect on a reasonable person. <em>See United States v. Thomas, </em>327 F.3d 253, 255 (3d Cir.2003). The teller\u2019s response is irrelevant because this is an objective, rather than a subjective, standard. Under the facts here, the District Court did not err in concluding that a reasonable person in the teller\u2019s position would believe her life was threatened. The argument that Schenck was visibly intoxicated and harmless was just that \u2014 mere argument. No evidence to this effect was produced.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-7\">Accordingly, the judgment of the District Court will be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
