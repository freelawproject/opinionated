Hawkes has filed two petitions to this court from decisions of the Merit Systems Protection Board, in Nos. SF-1221-02-0558-M-1 and SF-1221-06-0415-W-2. Both petitions pertain to allegations by Dr. Hawkes that he has been subjected to adverse personnel actions because of disclosures he has made regarding agency misconduct, in violation of the Whistleblower Protection Act. The Board has addressed his several claims in great detail in two lengthy and carefully reasoned opinions by administrative judge Craig A. Berg. In his order, the administrative judge granted relief to Dr. Hawkes on one of his claims, but held that most of his claims did not give rise to a right to relief. Although Dr. Hawkes has raised a number of objections to the Board\u2019s disposition of his two appeals, we <em>affirm </em>the decision of the Board in both cases, holding that the administrative judge\u2019s findings are supported by substantial evidence and are not infected by legal error.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-20\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b966-21\">Dr. Hawkes has served as a research chemist with the U.S. Department of Agriculture, working since 1994 at the Western Human Nutrition Research Center in California. In 1995, Dr. Hawkes made a disclosure to the California Office of Safety and Health Administration pertaining <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"941\">*941</page-number>to safety concerns he had regarding a study that the Research Center was planning to conduct involving the HIV virus. That disclosure led to an inspection of the Research Center by state and federal agencies, resulting in the issuance of recommendations regarding certain safety shortcomings at the Center. Subsequently, Dr. Hawkes made additional disclosures relating to computer security at the agency.</p>\n<p id=\"b967-5\">Between 1997 and 2000, the agency took several steps that Dr. Hawkes regarded as retaliation for his disclosures. He was removed from the Health and Safety Committee and the Operations Oversight Committee at the Research Center, he was removed as Acting Manager of the Bioanalytical Support Laboratory, and he lost supervisory responsibility over a subordinate employee. In addition, the agency suspended him for 14 days on charges relating to an inappropriate e-mail he had sent to various recipients within the agency-</p>\n<p id=\"b967-6\">In 2001, Dr. Hawkes filed an Individual Right of Action appeal with the Merit Systems Protection Board in which he contended that the agency\u2019s allegedly retaliatory acts violated the Whistleblower Protection Act. The Board denied relief. On appeal, this court upheld the Board\u2019s decision in several respects, but vacated the Board\u2019s order and remanded the case to the Board for further proceedings on one aspect of Dr. Hawkes\u2019 claim. In particular, this court directed the Board to address Dr. Hawkes\u2019 argument that his protected disclosure to the California Office of Safety and Health Administration was a contributing factor in the agency\u2019s decision to remove him from \u201cvarious positions at the Center,\u201d specifically, his positions as Acting Director of the Bioanalytieal Support Laboratory, as a member of the Operations Oversight Committee and the Health and Safety Committee, and his other supervisory responsibilities. <em>Hawkes v. Dep\u2019t of Agric., </em>116 Fed.Appx. 264 (Fed.Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b967-8\">In the remand proceedings, the administrative judge conducted a detailed review of the evidence relating to the remanded issues and reached the following conclusions: (1) that the agency had shown by clear and convincing evidence that it would have removed Dr. Hawkes from the Health and Safety Committee even in the absence of his protected disclosures; (2) that the agency had shown by clear and convincing evidence that it would have reassigned the subordinate employee from Dr. Hawkes\u2019 supervision even in the absence of his protected disclosures; (3) that the agency had shown by clear and convincing evidence that it would have removed Dr. Hawkes from the position of Acting Manager of the Bioanalytical Support Laboratory even in the absence of his protected disclosures; and (4) that the agency had failed to show by clear and convincing evidence that it would have removed Dr. Hawkes from the Operations Oversight Committee in the absence of the protected disclosures. Based on those findings, the administrative judge ordered specific relief with regard to Dr. Hawkes\u2019 position on the Operations Oversight team, but otherwise denied his claim. On Dr. Hawkes\u2019 petition for review, the full Board sustained the administrative judge\u2019s decision on the merits of the whistleblowing claims but remanded for further proceedings on Dr. Hawkes\u2019 request for consequential damages and foiwarded to the regional office Dr. Hawkes\u2019 allegations that the agency had not complied with the interim relief, directing that those allegations be treated as a petition for enforcement of a Board order. The administrative judge subsequently ordered the agency to pay Dr. Hawkes $1648.61 in consequential dam<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"942\">*942</page-number>ages and $3116.27 in attorney fees and costs. Dr. Hawkes now petitions for this court to review the Board\u2019s decision on remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-4\">While he was pressing his claims on remand, Dr. Hawkes filed a new Individual Right of Action Appeal with the Board in March 2006, in which he alleged that he made a protected disclosure of violations of various safety regulations in July 2005 and that the agency took adverse personnel actions against him in retaliation for that disclosure as well as the previous disclosures. That appeal was also assigned to administrative judge Berg. After a hearing, the administrative judge issued an initial decision on February 13, 2007, in which he denied Dr. Hawkes\u2019 request for corrective action with respect to each of his specific claims. In particular, the administrative judge ruled (1) that Dr. Hawkes had failed to show that his disclosures were a contributing factor in the agency\u2019s decisions not to reclassify Dr. Hawkes\u2019 position or to promote him; (2) the alleged threat to disband the Research Center\u2019s Health and Safety Committee did not constitute a \u201cpersonnel action\u201d within the meaning of the Whistleblower Protection Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 2302(b)(8), and even assuming that it did, the agency had shown by clear and convincing evidence that it would have discussed the possibility of disbanding the Health and Safety Committee even in the absence of Dr. Hawkes\u2019 disclosures; (3) that there was \u201coverwhelming evidence\u201d that there was no connection between an incident of oral counseling of Dr. Hawkes by a superior and Dr. Hawkes\u2019 whistleblowing disclosures, and that the agency had shown by clear and convincing evidence that it would have held the oral counseling session with Dr. Hawkes even in the absence of any of his disclosures; and (4) that the agency\u2019s January 2006 rating of Dr. Hawkes\u2019 performance as \u201cunacceptable,\u201d and its subsequent act of placing him on a Performance Improvement Plan (\u201cPIP\u201d), the administrative judge was \u201cleft with the firm conviction that, even in the absence of the appellant\u2019s disclosures, the agency would have given him an unacceptable rating for 2005 and placed him on a PIP.\u201d Dr. Hawkes did not seek review of the initial decision by the full Board, but petitioned directly to this court for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b968-7\"><em>Appeal No.2007-80i5. </em>Dr. Hawkes\u2019 first appeal is from the Board\u2019s decision following the remand from this court\u2019s 2004 order. In the 2004 decision, this court upheld the Board decision that was under review in all but one <em>respect </em>\u2014 we found it necessary to remand to the Board for a decision as to whether Dr. Hawkes\u2019 disclosure to the California Office of Safety and Health Administration contributed to four specific agency actions taken against Dr. Hawkes. The administrative judge conducted a comprehensive review of the evidence pertaining to that issue and ruled in Dr. Hawkes\u2019 favor with respect to one of the agency actions and against him with respect to the other three. We are fully satisfied that substantial evidence supports the administrative judge\u2019s conclusions as to each of the three contested actions on which the administrative judge ruled against him, and we sustain the administrative judge\u2019s decisions on those issues for the reasons given in the administrative judge\u2019s opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-8\">In his brief, Dr. Hawkes seeks to raise a large number of other issues, such as the propriety of the 14-day suspension imposed on him based on charges relating to an e-mail he sent to co-workers containing jokes with sexually oriented themes. Those issues, however, were not within the scope of this court\u2019s remand to the Board, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"943\">*943</page-number>and it was therefore proper for the Board to decline to address those issues. The issue regarding the 14-day suspension was raised and fully addressed in our earlier opinion, where we upheld the administrative judge\u2019s decision that the agency had proved by clear and convincing evidence that it would have imposed the 14-day suspension even in the absence of the protected disclosures. Other issues were either not raised in the earlier appeal or were not included within the scope of the remand. The Board was therefore correct not to address those issues in the course of the remand proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b969-5\"><em>Appeal No.2007-318h. </em>Dr. Hawkes\u2019 second appeal relates to complaints that arose after the first appeal. Dr. Hawkes\u2019 principal contention in the second appeal is that the denial of graduate student support and the delay of his research project, which he contends were acts of reprisal for his earlier disclosures, contributed to his low research productivity, which in turn contributed to the agency\u2019s denying him a promotion.</p>\n<p id=\"b969-7\">The administrative judge addressed Dr. Hawkes\u2019 argument in the opinion in the second appeal, noting that Dr. Hawkes had argued that his earlier disclosures were a contributing factor in the denial of his promotions and the failure to upgrade his position, because the agency had allegedly interfered with his ability to do the research necessary to warrant those benefits. The administrative judge concluded, however, that Dr. Hawkes had \u201cpresented no specific evidence supporting his claim that any delay in his research or any study he planned was connected to his whistleblowing, and thus his contention does not support a finding that the \u2018contributing factor\u2019 criteria was satisfied.\u201d The administrative judge\u2019s assessment of the evidence bearing on that issue is reasonable, and we therefore conclude that substantial evidence supports the administrative judge\u2019s conclusion that Dr. Hawkes failed to show that his protected disclosures contributed to the agency\u2019s act of denying him a promotion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
