Crosby, </em>397 F.3d 103 (2d Cir.2005) (establishing procedures for review of a defendant\u2019s sentence in the aftermath of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005)). <em>See United States v. Maldonado, </em>108 Fed.Appx. 29 (2d Cir.2004). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the facts and procedural history of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-18\">On appeal, Maldonado claims that the District Court failed to follow the procedures set out in <em>United States v. Garcia, </em>413 F.3d 201 (2d Cir.2005) (establishing procedures for <em>Crosby </em>review when the original sentencing judge is no longer available), when reviewing his sentence.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Specifically, Maldonado alleges that Judge Cote \u201cfailed to adequately consider aspects of the record that indicated that [Judge Martin] would have imposed a materially different sentence\u201d had Judge Martin not felt bound by the United States Sentencing Guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-19\">When a district court declines to resentence a defendant after a <em>Crosby </em>remand proceeding, we review \u201cthe procedure whereby the District Court decided not to resentence\u201d for reasonableness. <em>United States v. Williams, </em>475 F.3d 468, 471 (2d Cir.2007). For the reasons given below, we decline to order a second <em>Crosby </em>remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-20\">In <em>Garcia, </em>we noted that \u201cwe do not expect a successor judge to ... determine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>what sentence the original judge would have imposed on behalf of the court with a correct understanding of the law and a fully developed record.\u201d 413 F.3d at 228. \u201cRather, the successor judge should consider [the original sentencing judge\u2019s] observations together with all other relevant factors and then decide what sentence the successor judge would have imposed with the benefit of <em>Booker </em>and a fully developed record.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 228 n. 19. We further noted in <em>Garda </em>that \u201cthe necessary comparative assessment is most clearly made if the new judge states whether the sentence that judge would have imposed with the benefit of <em>Booker </em>is or is not the same as the challenged sentence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 229.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-4\">At Maldonado\u2019s original sentencing, Judge Martin noted that (1) Maldonado appeared to be a long-term dealer in medium quantities of drugs, rather than a high-level drug dealer and (2) his Criminal History Category overstated the seriousness of his criminal history. On that basis, Judge Martin reduced Maldonado\u2019s offense level by two points and granted Maldonado a horizontal departure from Criminal History Category III to Criminal History Category II. Judge Martin also ordered Maldonado\u2019s sentence to run concurrently with any sentence arising from Maldonado\u2019s recent state conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-5\">Before holding the post-remand <em>Crosby </em>hearing, Judge Cote requested the parties to provide supplementary briefing on the question of whether the sentence imposed upon Maldonado \u201cwould have been materially different ... had the standards enunciated in <em>[Booker </em>] been in effect\u201d at the time of his original sentencing. At the <em>Crosby </em>hearing, she noted that she had considered (1) \u201cthe parties\u2019 submissions and the facts of this case,\u201d (2) \u201cthe guidelines calculation,\u201d and (3) the structure of the sentence imposed by Judge Martin. Judge Cote then explained that \u201cunderstanding my discretion and my duty to take into account all of these factors, I do not find it appropriate to impose a sentence, or that I would in my discretion impose a sentence different from what Judge Martin originally imposed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b178-7\">Because the record indicates that Judge Cote considered all relevant factors before determining that she would have imposed substantially the same sentence that Judge Martin originally imposed, we cannot say that her decision not to resentence Maldonado was procedurally unreasonable. <em>Cf. United States v. Fernandez, </em>443 F.3d 19, 29-30 (2d Cir.2006) (noting that \u201cspecific verbal formulations\u201d are not necessary \u201cto demonstrate the adequate discharge of the duty to consider matters relevant to sentencing\u201d and explaining that \u201c[a]s long as the judge is aware of [the requirements] that are arguably applicable, and nothing in the record indicates misunderstanding about such [matters] or misperception about then* relevance, we will accept that the requisite consideration has occurred\u201d (quoting <em>United States v. Fleming, </em>397 F.3d 95, 100 (2d Cir.2005)) (internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b178-8\">Having considered all of Maldonado\u2019s arguments on appeal and found them to be without merit, we hereby AFFIRM the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b177-13\">. Maldonado was originally sentenced by <em>the </em>Honorable John S. Martin, Jr., United States District Judge for the Southern District of New York, who retired from the bench on September 30, 2003.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
