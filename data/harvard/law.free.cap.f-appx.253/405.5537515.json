In denying the petition, the district court held that Griggs had no protected liberty interest in his conditional release prior to the expiration of his sentence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3621(e). For the reasons below, we VACATE and REMAND.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-8\">\n<em>Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"Abn\">1. <em>Statement of Facts</em></p>\n<p id=\"b432-9\">In 1994, Steven Griggs plead guilty to conspiracy to manufacture, distribute, and possess 100 grams or more of methamphetamine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1), 846. He received a two-level enhancement at sentencing because he possessed a firearm during the offense; his ultimate sentence was 292 months of imprisonment. In November of 1995, he agreed to participate in the 500 Hour Residential Drug Abuse Program (\u201cDAP\u201d) at the El Reno, Oklahoma Federal Correctional Institution. He entered the residential phase on December 29,1995.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-10\">Four days later, on January 2, 1996, he was told he was ineligible for early release under the DAP guidelines because his crime was considered a crime of violence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(3) and Program Statements 5162.02 and 5330.10. After completing the residential phase in January of 1997, Griggs filed a Request for Administrative Remedy seeking a one-year sentence reduction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3621(e)(2)(B). The Bureau of Prisons (\u201cBOP\u201d) denied the request on the ground that his drug conviction with a sentence enhancement for possession of a firearm, constituted a crime of violence, rendering him ineligible for early release. Griggs\u2019s administrative appeals were unavailing.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-15\">In January of 1998, Griggs filed a \u00a7 1983 suit in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, challenging the BOP\u2019s ineligibility determination. The case was transferred to the United States District Court for the Western District of Oklahoma, as Griggs was then incarcerated at the Federal Transfer Center in Oklahoma City. In December of that year, the Oklahoma federal court dismissed his suit for failure to state: 1) a \u00a7 1983 claim because defendants were not state officials; 2) a claim for compensatory damages because defendants were entitled to sovereign immunity; and 3) a due process claim because he had no protected liberty interest in his sentence reduction. The district court construed his request for injunctive or declaratory relief as a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 petition. The Oklahoma federal court adopted the Magistrate\u2019s Report and Recommendation, which concluded that Griggs \u201cis entitled to be considered for a \u00a7 3621 sentence reduction ...\u201d The Oklahoma court then \u201cdirected [the BOP] to consider ... whether Plaintiff should receive a sentence reduction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3621 for his successful completion of the drug treatment program without reliance upon sentencing factors.\u201d In Jan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>uary of 1999, the Government filed a response indicating that in October, 1998, prior to the Oklahoma court\u2019s judgment, \u201c[pjlaintiffs eligibility for early release pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3621(e) was reviewed and <em>granted </em>on October 20, 1998. Plaintiffs projected satisfaction date has been recalculated ----\u201d (emphasis in the original).</p>\n<p id=\"b433-7\">By September of 2001, Griggs had been transferred to the Federal Medical Center in Fort Worth, Texas. At that time, he filed a motion in the Oklahoma district court seeking to compel the BOP to perform its duty. According to Griggs, after his transfer the BOP rescinded his eligibility for a sentence reduction. He alleged that the BOP\u2019s decision violated a constitutionally-protected liberty interest in his early release, created at the time the BOP determined that he was eligible under \u00a7 3621(e). The BOP, on the other hand, explained that its decision to rescind was based on a recent United States Supreme Court decision upholding the validity of the 1997 version of the regulations that permitted the BOP within its statutory discretion to consider sentencing factors. <em>See Lopez v. Davis, </em>531 U.S. 230, 235, 121 S.Ct. 714, 148 L.Ed.2d 635 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b433-8\">Ruling on Griggs\u2019 motion to compel, the Oklahoma federal court held that no liberty interest in a sentence reduction had been created, and that Griggs could not establish a violation of due process. In addition, the Oklahoma federal court determined that the BOP\u2019s decision did not constitute retroactive application of a new BOP policy because the BOP had always maintained that offenders with sentence enhancements for possession of a firearm at the time of the offense were ineligible for \u00a7 3621(e) early release. On appeal, the Tenth Circuit construed Griggs\u2019 motion to compel as a \u00a7 2241 petition and determined that the Oklahoma federal court lacked jurisdiction since Griggs was confined in Texas. The Tenth Circuit took a \u201cquick look\u201d at the merits of Griggs\u2019 claims, and \u201cconclude[d] that plaintiffs claims have sufficient merit to warrant a transfer to the Northern District of Texas.\u201d Gr<em>iggs v. U.S., </em>79 Fed.Appx. 359, 363 (10th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b433-10\">Accordingly, the Tenth Circuit vacated the second Oklahoma federal court judgment on the motion to compel and remanded the case with instructions to transfer the case to the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas. The Texas district court adopted the reasoning of the Oklahoma district court and denied the petition. Griggs timely appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-11\">2. <em>Conditional Release under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3621(e)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b433-13\">As incentive for inmate participation in substance abuse treatment programs, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3621(e)(2)(B) provides that prisoners convicted of \u201cnonviolent offenses who complete [such a program] may apply for a sentence reduction of up to one year; the determination lies in the discretion of the director of the Bureau of Prisons (\u201cBOP\u201d).\u201d In May of 1995, the BOP promulgated 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 550.58, which defines \u201cnonviolent offense\u201d by excluding those offenders convicted of offenses that meet the definition of \u201ccrime of violence\u201d in 18 U.S.C. 924(c)(4). <em>See Warren v. Miles, </em>230 F.3d 688, 691 (5th Cir.2000). In July of 1995, the BOP issued Program Statement 5162.02, which defines \u201ccrime of violence\u201d within the context of \u00a7 3621. <em>Id. </em>BOP\u2019s Change Notice CN-01 to Program Statement 5162.02, clarified the definition of \u201ccrime of violence\u201d by listing examples of ineligible inmates and included inmates serving a sentence for drug conspiracy enhanced for possession of a firearm, like Griggs. <em>Id. </em>at 691-92.</p>\n<p id=\"A9s\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>We have held that, under the 1995 version of \u00a7 550.58, the BOP\u2019s \u201cexclusion of ... drug convictions with enhanced sentences due to possession of a weapon from eligibility for early release after substance abuse treatment is consistent with the letter and spirit of the [BOPj\u2019s authority as derived from [\u00a7 3621(e) ].\u201d <em>Venegas v. Henman, </em>126 F.3d 760, 761-62 (5th Cir.1997). The Tenth Circuit, however, takes a different approach. Faced with the same question in 1998, that Circuit held that the language of the statute \u201cdoes not permit resort to sentencing factors or sentencing enhancements attached to the nonviolent offense[]\u201d and that the BOP\u2019s construction of the 1995 version of the regulations was therefore impermissible. <em>Fristoe v. Thompson, </em>144 F.3d 627, 631 (10th Cir.1998). In essence, the 1995 regulations would not apply in the Tenth Circuit, thus rendering inmates, like Griggs, eligible for a sentence reduction; the regulations, however, would apply within the Fifth Circuit rendering inmates, like Griggs, ineligible.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-4\">The BOP published a new \u00a7 550.58 in 1997. While the new version of the regulation still excluded offenders in possession of a firearm during the offense, the 1997 regulation did not do so by defining \u201cprisoner convicted of a nonviolent offense\u201d or \u201ccrimes of violence.\u201d <em>Lopez, </em>531 U.S. at 235, 121 S.Ct. 714. \u201cInstead, the [1997] regulation relie[d] upon \u2018the discretion allotted to the Director of the Bureau of Prisons in granting a sentence reduction to exclude [enumerated categories of] inmates.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting Drug Abuse Treatment and Intensive Confinement Center Programs: Early Release Consideration, 62 Fed.Reg. 53,690 (Oct. 15, 1997)). In 2001, the Supreme Court upheld the validity of the 1997 version of \u00a7 550.58. <em>See Lopez, </em>531 U.S. at 244, 121 S.Ct. 714.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-8\">According to the BOP\u2019s Operations Memorandum,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> an inmate who successfully completes the residential phase of a DAP in a Tenth Circuit Institution remains eligible for his sentence reduction even if he is later transferred out of the Tenth Circuit. The Memorandum states, however, that in order to maintain that eligibility \u201can inmate whose offense includes sentence enhancement factors must have completed the residential drug treatment program on or after April 28, 1998 in a Tenth Circuit institution.\u201d Griggs completed the residential program before April 28, 1998.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-9\">\n<em>Analysis</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b434-10\">On appeal,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Griggs argues 1) that the BOP violated his due process rights by retroactively applying a more restrictive version of 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 550.58, <em>i.e., </em>the 1997 regulations, in deciding to rescind the early release; 2) that his due process rights were violated when the BOP rescinded the \u00a7 3621(e) sentence reduction without any written notification or opportunity to be heard and 3) his rights to the sentence reduction should be preserved as <em>res judicata </em>and/or collateral estoppel.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-11\">The Government responds with several arguments: 1) the conditions of the Operations Memorandum are not fulfilled, so Griggs did not maintain his eligibility when he was transferred from the Tenth to the Fifth Circuit; 2) the BOP official who de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>nied Griggs eligibility erroneously relied solely on <em>Lopez, </em>but should have relied on the Fifth Circuit\u2019s opinion in <em>Venegas, </em>which upheld the BOP\u2019s 1995 regulations; 3) even if the denial was based on <em>Lopez, </em>the BOP has always maintained that felons like Griggs are ineligible, and therefore the 1997 regulation as applied to Griggs was no more restrictive than policies in existence when it granted Griggs eligibility; and 4) <em>res judicata </em>is not applicable to successive federal habeas petitions.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">We agree with Griggs that <em>res judicata </em>bars the BOP from raising any arguments that Griggs must now be determined ineligible based on sentencing factors.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Since the BOP\u2019s asserted bases below and on appeal for rescinding Griggs\u2019 eligibility rely on the applicability of sentencing factors, we now reinstate Griggs\u2019 eligibility and order the BOP to comply with the previous court order and determine \u201cwhether Plaintiff should receive a sentence reduction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3621 for his successful completion of the drug treatment program without reliance upon sentencing factors.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b435-6\">1. <em>Standard of Review</em></p>\n<p id=\"b435-7\">We review issues of law related to a denial of habeas relief under \u00a7 2241 <em>de novo. Royal v. Tombone, </em>141 F.3d 596, 599 (5th Cir.1998). We also review <em>pro se </em>briefs liberally. <em>Johnson v. Quarterman, </em>479 F.3d 358, 359 (5th Cir.2007) (citing <em>Haines v. Kerner, </em>404 U.S. 519, 520, 92 S.Ct. 594, 30 L.Ed.2d 652 (1972)).</p>\n<p id=\"b435-11\">2. <em>Res judicata Demands BOP Determine Griggs\u2019 Eligibility for a Sentence Reduction Without Considering Sentencing Factors</em></p>\n<p id=\"b435-12\">The dispositive question in this appeal is whether the BOP can consider sentencing factors, such as the possession of a firearm during the commission of the crime, in determining Griggs\u2019 eligibility for a sentence reduction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3621. This exact issue was already litigated between the parties. In the original action before the Oklahoma district court, the district court considered arguments from both Griggs and the BOP concerning the use of sentencing factors in determining Griggs\u2019 eligibility for a sentence reduction. <em>See Defendant\u2019s Motion to Dismiss and Brief to Support, </em>at R. 126-27 (May 26, 1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b435-13\">The district court granted Griggs habeas relief and fully adopted the Magistrate\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>Report and Recommendation, which rejected BOP\u2019s use of sentencing factors to determine Griggs\u2019 eligibility and concluded, as a matter of law, that Griggs \u201cis entitled to be considered for a \u00a7 3621 sentence reduction....\u201d R. at 344. To implement this decision, the district court granted habeas relief \u201cto the extent that the Bureau of Prisons is directed to consider ... without reliance on sentencing factors, whether plaintiff should receive a sentence reduction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3621.\u201d R. at 364a. The BOP never appealed the district court\u2019s adoption of the Magistrate\u2019s Report and Recommendation nor the order granting habeas relief; therefore the report and order are final judgments with <em>res judicata </em>effect. <em>Royal Ins. Co. of Am. v. Quinn-L Capital Corp., </em>960 F.2d 1286, 1293 (5th Cir.1992). We must now give full <em>res judicata </em>effect to this original final judgment. <em>United States v. Davenport, </em>484 F.3d 321, 327 n. 10 (5th Cir.2007).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AP7\"><em>\u201cRes judicata </em>is appropriate if (1) the parties are identical or in privity; (2) the judgment in the prior action was rendered by a court of competent jurisdiction; (3) the prior action was concluded to a final judgment on the merits; and (4) the same claim or cause of action was involved in both suits.... If these conditions are satisfied <em>res judicata </em>prohibits either party from raising any claim or defense in the later action that was or could have been raised in support of or in opposition to the cause of action asserted in the prior action.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b436-7\"><em>Matter of Swate, </em>99 F.3d 1282, 1286 (5th Cir.1996). The conditions for <em>res judicata </em>are fulfilled here. The parties are identical; the Oklahoma district court had competent jurisdiction over the original action; the prior action was concluded to a final judgment (not appealed) on the merits; and the same cause of action is asserted in both habeas petitions, <em>i.e., </em>whether determining Griggs\u2019 eligibility using sentencing factors is appropriate.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>Res judicata </em>applies to any BOP argument that use of sentencing factors is now appropriate in considering whether to grant Griggs a sentence reduction.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b437-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>Since the BOP later rescinded Gi'iggs\u2019 eligibility based on sentencing factors by citing to <em>Lopez </em>and <em>Venegas, </em>which are cases that upheld the BOP\u2019s use of sentencing factors in eligibility decisions, the BOP has failed to comply with the binding effect of the previous judgment barring the use of sentencing factors. We must now issue a remedy necessary to protect Griggs\u2019 judgment in the original district court decision. \u201cPrevailing parties are entitled to the protection and fruits of the judgments which become final.\u201d <em>Cliett v. Hammonds, </em>305 F.2d 565, 572 (5th Cir.1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b437-5\">The intervening transfer of the case from the Tenth Circuit to the Fifth Circuit does not affect the res <em>judicata </em>effect of the final Oklahoma court judgment. <em>See In re Korean Air Lines Disaster of Sept. 1, 1983, </em>829 F.2d 1171, 1177 (D.C.Cir.1987) (Ginsburg, D.H., J., concurring) (\u201c[Tjhere are some circumstances in which a federal court is bound to apply the decisions of another circuit, but they are the rare instances where a preclusion doctrine so requires. The doctrines of <em>res judicata, </em>collateral estoppel, and law of the case come to mind.\u201d); <em>Skil Corp. v. Millers Falls Co., </em>541 F.2d 554, 558 (6th Cir.1976) (applying <em>res judicata </em>effect to decision from the Seventh Circuit). Moreover, even if the original basis for the Oklahoma district court decision was erroneous based on changing intervening law, courts respect the finality of a previous judgment and accord the judgment full <em>res judicata </em>effect. <em>Fed. Dep\u2019t Stores, Inc. v. Moitie, </em>452 U.S. 394, 398, 101 S.Ct. 2424, 69 L.Ed.2d 103 (1981) (\u201cNor are the <em>res judicata </em>consequences of a final, unappealed judgment on the merits altered by the fact that the judgment may have been wrong or rested on a legal principle subsequently overruled in another case.\u201d); <em>RecoverEdge L.P. v. Pentecost, </em>44 F.3d 1284, 1296 (5th Cir.1995) (\u201cIt is well settled, however, that even arguably erroneous judgments have preclusive effect if the requirements for collateral estoppel are satisfied.\u201d) (citing numerous Circuit cases for this proposition); <em>Matter of Teal, </em>16 F.3d 619, 622 (5th Cir.1994) (\u201cThis conclusion comports with the well-known rule that a federal court may not abrogate principles of <em>res judicata </em>out of equitable concerns.... Indeed, it must give <em>res judicata </em>effect to a prior judgment even if it would be voidable on appeal because of legal error.\u201d); <em>In re </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number><em>Atlas Sewing Centers, Inc., </em>437 F.2d 607, 614 (5th Cir.1971) (\u201c[i\u00fces <em>judicata] </em>does not allow parties to await the event and then to determine that a judgment acquiesced in earlier ought to have been challenged.\u201d). Therefore, even if the BOP may now challenge the basis for the district court decision as arguably wrong under Fifth Circuit case-law or subsequent Supreme Court decisions, the finality and binding effect of the decision is unaffected.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-4\">The <em>res judicata </em>analysis also renders irrelevant the Government\u2019s use of the Operations Memorandum as a basis to bar Griggs from maintaining his eligibility upon transfer outside of the Tenth Circuit.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The Operations Memorandum is irrelevant to his appeal, because <em>res judicata </em>preserves his eligibility after transfer. The Operations Memorandum offers Griggs a regulatory route to \u201cmaintain\u201d his eligibility, but Griggs does not need this regulatory mechanism to maintain his eligibility. <em>Res judicata </em>provides an alternative and sufficient mechanism that maintains his eligibility without the consideration of sentencing factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">The Government\u2019s cited reasons for rescinding Griggs\u2019 eligibility are all based on Griggs\u2019 sentencing factors, which is a violation of the previous final court order from the Oklahoma district court. Therefore, we now GRANT Griggs habeas relief and REVERSE the Texas district court judgment and REMAND this case to the Texas district court for it to enforce the previous final court order and ensure the BOP determines \u201cwhether Plaintiff should receive a sentence reduction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3621 for his successful completion of the drug treatment program without reliance upon sentencing factors\u201d consistent with this opinion and within a reasonable time period.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b432-11\">.

The Operations Memorandum states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b434-6\">To maintain eligibility upon transfer out of the Tenth Circuit, an inmate whose offense includes sentence enhancement factors must have completed the residential drug treatment program on or after April 28, 1998 [i.e., the date the Tenth Circuit issued its decision in <em>Fristoe </em>], in a Tenth Circuit institution.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b434-13\">.

Moreover, in the pleadings below, the Government interprets Griggs' argument as raising <em>res judicata </em>and collateral estoppel issues, and presents a counterargument that the \"law of the case\u201d should be the applicable doctrine. The Government states in the record below:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-9\">Plaintiff argues he has been eligible for early release for nearly three years, and the Bureau of Prisons cannot now, on a whim, take away that vested interest, essentially arguing the principle of <em>res judicata </em>or issue preclusion.

We read the Magistrate's Report and Recommendation adopted by the district court as concluding that the use of sentencing factors in determining Griggs' eligibility is not appropriate. \"The effect of a decree, as an adjudication conclusive on the parties, is not determined by isolated passages in opinion, but by examination of issues made and intended to be submitted and decided.\u201d <em>State of Okla. v.

The Government misconstrues <em>Patrasso </em>because it is clear that <em>Patrasso </em>is discussing the <em>res judicata </em>effect of a <em>state </em>post-conviction judgment on a federal habeas petition. <em>Id; Carter v.

United States, </em>373 U.S. 1, 7, 83 S.Ct. 1068, 10 L.Ed.2d 148 (1963) (\"At common law, the denial by a court or judge of an application for habeas corpus was not <em>res judicata.\u201d).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b436-9\">On the other hand, a judgment granting a petitioner habeas relief is <em>res judicata </em>on the issues of law and fact necessarily involved in the result. <em>Collins v. Loisel, </em>262 U.S. 426, 430, 43 S.Ct. 618, 67 L.Ed. 1062 (1923); <em>Anselmo v.

An order granting habeas corpus, unlike a denial of habeas relief, is a \"final judgment\u201d and is <em>res judicata </em>on issues in subsequent habeas petitions, since the petitioner is now enforcing a final court order. <em>Compare Patterson v. Haskins, </em>470 F.3d 645, 661 (6th Cir.2006); <em>In Re Moody, </em>817 F.2d 365, 368 (5th Cir.1987) (\"That further proceedings were necessary to enforce the judgment .... does not mitigate the effect of the order. A judgment becomes final despite the fact that it has not been executed. The finality of a decree is not impaired because some future order of the court may become necessary to carry it into effect.\u201d), <em>with Potts v. Zant, </em>638 F.2d <em>727, </em>738 (5th Cir.1981) (\u201cThe doctrine of abuse of the writ has developed as a result of the familiar rule of law that a denial of an application for habeas corpus is not <em>res judicata </em>with respect to subsequent applications.\u201d). The case-law permits the application of <em>res judicata </em>to <em>successful </em>habeas petitions as part and parcel of the power of this court to enforce a final judgment in subsequent proceedings, whereas <em>unsuccessful </em>habeas petitions are subject to the \u201cabuse of the writ\u201d doctrine empowering federal courts to control the potentially endless successive petitions attacking the conviction after an initial denial of habeas relief. <em>Cf. In re Cain, </em>137 F.3d 234, 235-36 &amp; n. 1 (5th Cir.1998) (describing the federal court's \"gate-keeping\u201d function under AEDPA and the \u201cabuse of writ\u201d doctrine).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b438-15\">. Moreover, the BOP concedes the agency decision to rescind Griggs' eligibility was based solely (and erroneously) on <em>Lopez. </em>Reference to other reasons for the decision to rescind Griggs\u2019 eligibility, including the Operations Memorandum, offered for the first time on appeal is a <em>\u201cpost hoc </em>rationalization\u201d advanced by an agency seeking to defend past agency decision against attack. <em>See Burlington Truck Lines, Inc. v.
