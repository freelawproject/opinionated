As part of his decision, Magistrate Judge Bianchini issued a certificate of appealability on Janick\u2019s claim \u201cthat his plea agreement was ambiguous and should have been construed as a \u2018no misconduct\u2019 agreement and on his claim that, having found that his plea agreement contained a \u2018no arrest\u2019 provision, the court erred in applying only the \u2018legitimate basis\u2019 standard of proof.\u201d <em>Janick v. Superintendent, Franklin Corr. Facility, </em>404 F.Supp.2d 472, 488 (W.D.N.Y. 2005). Janick appeals only whether the state court erred in using the \u201clegitimate basis\u201d standard of proof to enhance his sentence. We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and the procedural history of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-7\">Janick claims that the state court\u2019s determination that his sentence could be enhanced as a result of his arrest pending sentencing, <em>see People v. Outley, </em>80 N.Y.2d 702, 594 N.Y.S.2d 683, 610 N.E.2d 356 (1993), is contrary to, or an unreasonable application of, clearly established federal law as determined by the Supreme Court. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d). In particular, Janick argues that his due process rights were violated because he was not punished for actual misconduct but rather for having been arrested for a crime he contends that he did not commit. Supreme Court precedent, however, does not shed much light on the minimum burden of proof that must be met when factual contentions are subject to dispute at sentencing. <em>See, e.g., McMillan v. Pennsylvania, </em>477 U.S. 79, 91-92, 106 S.Ct. 2411, 91 L.Ed.2d 67 (1986) (finding no \u201cwarrant [for] constitutionalizing burdens of proof at sentencing\u201d but noting that \u201cthe preponderance standard satisfies due process\u201d). Nevertheless, to the extent that this Court has stated that \u201cdue process in sentencing requires at least a showing by a preponderance of evidence,\u201d <em>Torres v. Berbary, </em>340 F.3d 63, 71 (2d Cir.2003), Janick received sufficient process in his state court proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-9\">As the district court observed, Janick had \u201cmore than a full-blown evidentiary hearing [at his <em>Outley </em>hearing before sentencing] to determine whether he had violated the \u2018no arrest condition\u2019 of the plea agreement \u2014 the prosecution essentially conducted a \u2018mini-trial\u2019 of its case against Janick with respect to the charges underlying the new arrest.\u201d <em>Janick, </em>404 F.Supp.2d at 486. In light of police officer testimony that Janick admitted during questioning that he met the complainant in the park; the complainant\u2019s testimony suggesting that Janick sat in the passenger side of complainant\u2019s car and touched the car door in several places; physical evidence confirming that Janick\u2019s fingerprints were found where the complainant said they were; and expert testimony concerning the lifting of the prints and the fingerprint analysis, the sentencing judge reasonably concluded that the evidence \u201cmore than sufficiently establishes a legitimate basis for [Janick\u2019s] arrest.\u201d Although the sentencing judge did not specifically utter the words \u201cpreponderance of the evidence,\u201d it is clear from his comments and the evidence adduced at the hearing that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>the preponderance standard was satisfied and Janick was afforded due process. Moreover, Janick had a \u201cmeaningful opportunity to be heard,\u201d <em>Boddie v. Connecticut, </em>401 U.S. 371, 377, 91 S.Ct. 780, 28 L.Ed.2d 113 (1971), in that he presented a full defense and testified under oath at the hearing. <em>Cf. Torres, </em>340 F.3d at 72 (holding without explanation that because defendant\u2019s testimony at his sentencing was unsworn, this was a factor in granting the writ). We therefore agree with the district court that \u201c[t]here is no point in upsetting Janick\u2019s conviction for purely academic reasons,\u201d <em>Janick, 404 </em>F.Supp.2d at 487, and deny Janick\u2019s request for relief.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b93-5\">We have considered Janick\u2019s remaining arguments and find them to be without merit. For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b93-15\">. Because we find that the <em>Outley </em>hearing satisfies due process requirements, we need not address whether Justice Kenneth R. Fisher\u2019s findings pursuant to Janick\u2019s N.Y. Crim. Law \u00a7 440.20 motion, which more clearly articulated that Janick \"most likely committed the act charged,\u201d and that the evidence of guilt was \"clear and convincing,\u201d <em>see People v. Janick, </em>186 Misc.2d 1, 713 N.Y.S.2d 838, 842 (N.Y.Sup.Ct.2000) (citation omitted), are entitled to deference under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(e)(1).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
