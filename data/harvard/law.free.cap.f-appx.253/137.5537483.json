We presume the pai\u2019ties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-15\">Although the BIA adopted the IJ\u2019s decision, it substantially modified it by finding that the majority of the IJ\u2019s findings did not support an adverse credibility determination. Instead, the BIA found that many of the IJ\u2019s findings supported its conclusion that petitioner\u2019s account was insufficiently specific and insufficiently corroborated to sustain his burden of proof. Therefore, we review the IJ\u2019s decision as modified by the BIA, i.e., minus the findings rejected by the\u2019 BIA. <em>See Xue Hong Yang v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>426 F.3d 520, 522 (2d Cir.2005). We decline to consider, however, whether the BIA\u2019s findings regarding the motivation of the 1985 attack, petitioner\u2019s subsequent relocation, and his return to India after coming to the United States support the BIA\u2019s conclusion that petitioner failed to sustain his burden of proof, as they constitute impermissible factfinding. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(d)(3)(i), (iv); <em>Xian Tuan Ye v. Dep\u2019t of Homeland Sec., </em>446 F.3d 289, 296 (2d Cir.2006). Because the BIA rejected the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>and phrased its reasoning in terms of petitioner\u2019s failure to corroborate his claim, we review the BIA\u2019s decision in that respect.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">Before denying a claim solely because of an applicant\u2019s failure to provide corroborating evidence, the agency must \u201cexplain specifically, either in its decision or otherwise in the record: (1) why it is reasonable under the BIA\u2019s standards to expect such corroboration; and (2) why [the applicant\u2019s] proffered explanations for the lack of such corroboration are insufficient.\u201d <em>Diallo v. INS, </em>282 F.3d 279, 290 (2d Cir.2000). Whereas this analysis is not required when the IJ\u2019s corroboration concerns are tied to an adverse credibility determination, <em>see Xiao Ji Chen v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>434 F.3d 144, 164 (2d Cir.2006), the agency has \u201cno leeway\u201d to deny an otherwise credible asylum application solely for want of corroborative evidence without first carrying out these two steps, <em>Jin Shui Qiu v. Ashcroft, </em>329 F.3d 140, 153 (2d Cir.2003). Furthermore, the applicant must be given an opportunity not only to \u201cexplain\u201d the absence of the requested corroboration, <em>Cao He Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>428 F.3d 391, 394-95 (2d Cir.2005), but also \u201cto submit what may be readily available evidence,\u201d <em>see Ming Shi Xue v. BIA, </em>439 F.3d 111, 122 (2d Cir.2006) (explaining that these requirements are designed \u201cnot only to guard against arbitrary and excessive requests by an IJ, but also, and equally importantly, to guarantee applicants an opportunity to remedy the supposed evidentiai\u2019y gap\u201d (internal citations omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">In support of its determination, the BIA cited the IJ\u2019s finding that Hass failed to submit documentation corroborating his father\u2019s murder. Hass was questioned extensively regarding this insufficiency and testified that nothing the IJ requested was available. Because the agency requested nothing further that Hass could have obtained, it was unreasonable to expect Hass to produce corroboration and fault him for this deficiency. <em>See Jin Shui Qiu, </em>329 F.3d at 153. The BIA further cited the IJ\u2019s finding that Dr. Sood\u2019s affidavit was too general to corroborate petitioner\u2019s claim concerning the March 2001 attack. Hass was not questioned regarding Dr. Sood\u2019s affidavit during the hearing, and the agency failed to explain why it was reasonable to expect further corroboration of the claim. Additionally, the agency failed to explain why Davinder Kumar\u2019s affidavit was insufficient corroboration of the March 2001 incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-8\">Because many of these findings were in error, we cannot confidently predict that the same result would be reached on remand absent these errors, and therefore remand petitioner\u2019s asylum claim. See <em>Xiao Ji Chen, </em>434 F.3d at 162; <em>Li Hua Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>453 F.3d 99, 108 (2d Cir.2006). We dismiss petitioner\u2019s withholding and CAT claims because they were waived on appeal. See <em>Yueqing Zhang v. Gonzales, </em>426 F.3d 540, 545 n. 7 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b165-9\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is GRANTED as it relates to petitioner\u2019s claim for asylum. Petitioner\u2019s claims for withholding and CAT relief are DISMISSED. The BIA\u2019s order is VACATED, and the case is REMANDED for further proceedings with respect to the asylum claim. Having completed our review, any stay of removal that the Court previously granted in this petition is VACATED, and any pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DENIED as moot. Any pending request for oral argument in this petition is DENIED in accordance with Federal Rule of Appel<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>late Procedure 34(a)(2), and Second Circuit Local Rule 34(d)(1).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
