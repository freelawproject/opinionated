Petitioners International Association of Machinists &amp; Aerospace Workers (\u201cLAM\u201d) and SSA Terminals, LLC, seek judicial review of Respondent National Labor Relations Board\u2019s order quashing a notice of hearing in a proceeding initiated under \u00a7 10(k) of the National Labor Relations Act (\u201cNLRA\u201d), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 160(k).</p>\n<p id=\"b651-24\">The Board\u2019s findings of fact are conclusive if supported by substantial evidence. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 160(e)-(f). \u201cUnder this standard, a finding will not be disturbed if supported by \u2018such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u2019 \u201d <em>Howard v. FAA, </em>17 F.3d 1213, 1216 (9th Cir.1994) (quoting. <em>Consol. Edison Co. of N.Y. v. NLRB, </em>305 U.S. 197, 229, 59 S.Ct. 206, 83 L.Ed. 126 (1938)). We must consider \u201cthe record as a whole, ... weighing both the evidence that supports and the evidence that detracts from the [agency\u2019s] decision.\u201d <em>Mayes v. Massanari, </em>276 F.3d 453, 459 (9th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b651-25\">In this case, there was testimony that, prior to 2004, workers represented by the International Longshore and Warehouse Union (\u201cILWU\u201d) had exclusively per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>formed the \u201creefer\u201d work at Howard Terminal regardless of the ownership of the containers. Furthermore, the record contains, and the Board\u2019s decision discussed, the collective bargaining agreement between IAM and SSA, the collective bargaining agreement between ILWU and SSA, and the arbitration decisions of both arbitrator Souza and arbitrator Sutliffe. Therefore, viewing the Board\u2019s findings of fact \u201cwith a deferential eye,\u201d <em>Recon Refractory &amp; Constr. Inc. v. NLRB, </em>424 F.3d 980, 986 (9th Cir.2005), we hold that the findings as to the substance of the controversy as a work preservation dispute and not a jurisdictional dispute were supported by substantial evidence on the record as a whole.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-4\">The Board\u2019s legal conclusions are entitled to \u201cconsiderable deference\u201d and must be upheld unless arbitrary and capricious or based upon a mistake of law. <em>Recon, </em>424 F.3d at 987. Likewise, \u201c[i]f the Board\u2019s construction of the [NLRA] is \u2018reasonably defensible,\u2019 it should not be rejected merely because the courts might prefer another view of the statute.\u201d <em>USCP-WESCO, Inc. v. NLRB, </em>827 F.2d 581, 583 (9th Cir.1987). Thus, we owe deference to the Board\u2019s application and understanding of \u00a7 10(k), the result of which is to maintain the status quo until the parties bargain for a new contract. Notwithstanding the somewhat abstruse penultimate paragraph \u2014 and corresponding footnote \u2014 of the Board\u2019s decision, the <em>holding </em>in the preceding paragraph of the Board\u2019s decision is clear and represents a permissible interpretation of the situation. Furthermore, the Board reasonably relied upon <em>Teamsters Local 578 (Uscp-Wesco, Inc.), </em>280 N.L.R.B. 818 (1986), and (Recon <em>Refractory &amp; Constr. Inc.), </em>339 N.L.R.B. 825 (2003)\u2014each dealing with the same specific issue and the same critical facts as this case \u2014 in concluding that this dispute was a work preservation dispute occasioned by the employer\u2019s unilateral actions. The Board\u2019s legal conclusions are therefore neither arbitrary and capricious nor based upon a mistake of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b651-18\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
