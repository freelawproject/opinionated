Berman, Judge) granting defendantappellee\u2019s motion to dismiss Parks\u2019s complaint as time-barred. We presume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the facts and the issues on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-20\">We review an order granting a motion to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) <em>de novo, </em>\u201cconstruing the complaint liberally, accepting all factual allegations in the complaint as true, and drawing all reasonable inferences in the plaintiff\u2019s favor.\u201d <em>Chambers v. Time Warner, Inc., </em>282 F.3d 147, 152 (2d Cir.2002). In our review, we consider only those facts alleged in the complaint or in documents attached to the complaint as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>exhibits or incorporated in the complaint by reference. <em>See Pani v. Empire Blue Cross Blue Shield, </em>152 F.3d 67, 71 (2d Cir.1998), <em>cert. denied, </em>525 U.S. 1103, 119 S.Ct. 868, 142 L.Ed.2d 770 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b169-5\">A plaintiff must satisfy two conditions before bringing a private lawsuit under Title VII in federal court: (1) timely filing of a charge of discrimination with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (\u201cEEOC\u201d) and (2) timely filing of a federal court suit. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(e)(1). In New York, a Title VII \u201ccomplainant has 300 days from the date of the alleged unlawful employment practice to institute proceedings\u201d with the relevant state or local agency \u2014 in this case, the New York City Commission on Human Rights (\u201cNYCCHR\u201d). <em>Forsyth v. Fed\u2019n Employment &amp; Guidance Serv., </em>409 F.3d 565, 572 (2d Cir.2005), <em>abrogated on other grounds by Ledbetter v. Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co., </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 127 S.Ct. 2162, 167 L.Ed.2d 982 (2007); <em>see also Harris v. City of New York, </em>186 F.3d 243, 247 n. 2 (2d Cir.1999) (characterizing New York as a so-called \u201cdeferral state\u201d for purposes of Title VII). \u201cOtherwise, the complainant has only 180 days from the date of the alleged unlawful employment practice to file a complaint with the EEOC.\u201d <em>Forsyth, </em>409 F.3d at 572. Where a plaintiff fails to file a timely charge with the EEOC, either directly or through an authorized state or local agency, the federal complaint is time-barred. <em>See Ford v. Bernard Fineson Dev. Ctr., </em>81 F.3d 304, 307 (2d Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b169-8\">Here, the District Court correctly concluded that Title VII does not cover alleged discrimination on the basis of an employee\u2019s arrest record and that Parks\u2019s original NYCCHR complaint discusses only this kind of discrimination. Moreover, the District Court also correctly concluded that the allegations of race discrimination contained in Parks\u2019s federal complaint do not relate back to the NYCCHR complaint. Parks raised her race discrimination claims for the first time on her direct appeal from the initial NYCCHR determination, and she has identified no authority in support of the proposition that such an action amounts to an amendment of her original complaint, or is the equivalent of filing of an entirely new complaint before the NYCCHR. Our review of the case law has revealed none. Parks\u2019s racial discrimination claims therefore cannot be deemed to have been dually-filed with the EEOC on the date that she first raised them before the NYCCHR. Moreover, to the extent that Parks argues that her EEOC charge should form the basis of her satisfying \u00a7 2000e-5(e)(l), the District Court correctly found that the date of her filing that charge \u2014 March 8, 2005 \u2014 lay beyond the 300-day statutory limitations period. As there was no indication that Parks filed a charge alleging discrimination prohibited by Title VII within the applicable time limits of the alleged adverse employment action, her federal complaint is time-barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-10\">For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
