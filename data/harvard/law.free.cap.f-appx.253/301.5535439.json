Commander was sentenced to five years of probation. Commander was subsequently charged with conspiracy to com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>mit bank fraud, in violation of 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 1344 (2000) and 1349 (West 2000 and Supp. 2007) for his participation in a check kiting scheme. Pursuant to a plea agreement, Commander pled guilty to the sole count in the indictment on November 20, 2006. The probation office then issued a petition for a warrant or summons for Commander, alleging that his conviction for conspiracy to commit bank fraud violated the terms of his probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-4\">On April 19, 2007, the district court held a sentencing hearing for Commander\u2019s new conviction and a probation revocation hearing. Prior to the hearing, the probation office prepared a presentence investigation report and a probation violation report. In Commander\u2019s presentenee report, the probation officer calculated an advisory guidelines range of twenty-seven to thirty-three months. In the probation violation report, a different probation officer determined that, pursuant to USSG \u00a7 7B1.1, conspiracy to commit bank fraud constituted a Grade B violation. The officer then recommended a sentence of twelve to eighteen months\u2019 imprisonment based on USSG \u00a7 7B1.4(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">At Commander\u2019s hearing, the district court, after hearing no objection from either counsel regarding the officer\u2019s calculations, adopted the presentence report and sentenced Commander to twenty-seven months\u2019 imprisonment for his conviction of conspiring to commit bank fraud. The district court then revoked Commander\u2019s probation and sentenced him to a consecutive term of twelve months\u2019 imprisonment, in conformity with the probation officer\u2019s calculation in the probation violation report. Commander timely noted his appeal to both his conviction for conspiring to commit bank fraud and his revocation of probation. Commander\u2019s counsel has filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), and questions whether: (1) the district court complied with Fed.R.Crim.P. 11 in accepting Commander\u2019s guilty plea; (2) the district court abused its discretion in revoking Commander\u2019s probation; and (3) the sentence imposed by the district court was reasonable.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> We affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-9\">Under Fed.R.Crim.P. 11(b), a district court must address the defendant in open court and inform him of the following: the nature of the charge; any mandatory minimum sentence and the maximum possible sentence; the applicability of the sentencing guidelines; the defendant\u2019s right to an attorney; his right to plead not guilty; his right to be tried by a jury with the assistance of counsel; his right to confront and cross-examine witnesses; and his right against self-incrimination. The court must also advise the defendant that a guilty plea waives any further trial and that his answers at the proceeding may be used against him in a prosecution for perjury. Under Rule 11(b)(2), the court must address the defendant to determine that his plea is voluntary. The court must require disclosure of any plea agreement under Rule 11(c)(2), and determine whether a factual basis exists for the plea under Rule 11(b)(3). Our review of the record reveals that the district court conducted a thorough inquiry pursuant to Rule 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-10\">Commander next questions whether the district court abused its discretion in revoking his supervised release. A decision to revoke a defendant\u2019s supervised release is reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Davis, </em>53 F.3d 638, 642-43 (4th Cir.1995). A district court need only find a violation by a preponderance of the evidence to revoke a defendant\u2019s su<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>pervised release. 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3583(e)(8) (West 2000 and Supp. 2007). Here, Commander knowingly and intelligently pled guilty to conspiring to commit bank fraud; Commander committed his new offense while on supervised release. Accordingly, the district court did not abuse its discretion in revoking Commander\u2019s supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">Finally, Commander questions whether his sentence is reasonable. After <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), a sentencing court must engage in a multi-step process at sentencing. After calculating the correct advisory guidelines range, the sentencing court must consider the guidelines range, any relevant factors set forth in the guidelines, and the factors in 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(a) (West 2000 and Supp. 2007); then the court may impose sentence. <em>United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540, 546 (4th Cir.2005). On appeal, this court reviews a sentence to determine whether it is reasonable. <em>United States v. Moreland, </em>437 F.3d 424, 433 (4th Cir.2006). A <em>post-Booker </em>sentence may be unreasonable for procedural or substantive reasons. However, a sentence that falls within a properly calculated advisory guidelines range is presumed to be reasonable. <em>Rita v. United States, </em>\u2014U.S.-, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2462,168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b329-8\">On the basis of the record presented to this court, we cannot conclude that Commander\u2019s sentence of twenty-seven months, at the low end of his guidelines as calculated by the district court, was unreasonable. The district court specifically considered the advisory nature of the guidelines, the factors in \u00a7 3553(a), Commander\u2019s cooperation in the bank fraud case, and Commander\u2019s declining health. The court also considered defense counsel\u2019s argument that the two sentences should run concurrently; however, the court determined that consecutive sentences at the low end of Commander\u2019s guideline ranges was the appropriate outcome.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-10\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the record in this case and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. We therefore affirm the district court\u2019s judgment. This court requires that counsel inform Commander, in writing, of the right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If Commander requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was seived on Commander.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-11\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-12\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b328-6\"> Commander was informed of his right to file a pro se supplemental brief. He has elected not to do so.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
