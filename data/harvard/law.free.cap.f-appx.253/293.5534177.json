Quijivix-Xicara appeals his sentence, challenging the district court\u2019s enhancement of his base offense level by sixteen levels after finding that his prior third degree assault conviction under Or. Rev.Stat. \u00a7 163.165(l)(h) (2003) qualified as a crime of violence, <em>see U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 2L1.2 (b)(l)(A)(ii) &amp; cmt. n. l(B)(iii) (2005). Finding no reversible error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-24\">Quijivix-Xicara asserts on appeal that his prior Oregon third degree assault conviction does not qualify as a crime of violence under the guidelines because the statute does not have as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against another. \u201cIn assessing a challenge to a sentencing court\u2019s application of the Guidelines, we review <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>the court\u2019s factual findings for clear error and its legal conclusions de novo.\u201d <em>United States v. Allen, </em>446 F.3d 522, 527 (4th Cir.2006). Our review of the record leads us to conclude that third degree assault under \u00a7 163.165(l)(h) qualifies as a crime of violence under the guidelines. <em>See Taylor v. United States, </em>495 U.S. 575, 602, 110 S.Ct. 2143, 109 L.Ed.2d 607 (1990) (discussing cat\u00e9gorieal approach); <em>State v. Capwell, 52 </em>Or.App. 43, 627 P.2d 905, 907 n. 3 (1981) (\u201cThe term \u2018physical injury\u2019 [in the criminal assault statute, regardless of degree,] recognizes that the cause of such an injury is some form of external violence that produces a harmful effect upon the body\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b320-4\">Accordingly, we affirm. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
