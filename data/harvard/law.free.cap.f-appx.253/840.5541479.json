Nat\u2019l Adver. Co. v. City of Miami, </em>402 F.3d 1335, 1338 (11th Cir.2005), <em>cert. denied, </em>546 U.S. 1170, 126 S.Ct. 1318, 164 L.Ed.2d 48 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b867-7\">After reviewing the record and reading the parties\u2019 briefs, we affirm the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of the County based on its well-reasoned and thorough 61-page order. We agree with the district court that Ordinance 96-13 is a proper time, place, and manner regulation, and not a total ban on speech, because it does not prohibit the viewing of sexually explicit materials, but instead, regulates the manner in which such materials must be viewed. We also agree with the district court that in enacting Ordinance 96-13 the County had before it sufficient evidence reasonably relevant to combat the spread of AIDS and STDs, which was the stated purpose of Ordinance 96-13.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-8\">In conclusion, because we find no merit to any of the arguments plaintiffs make in this appeal, we affirm the district court\u2019s final judgment entered in favor of the County.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
