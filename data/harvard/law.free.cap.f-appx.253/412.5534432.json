For the first time on appeal, Moreland contends that the 36-month sentence imposed by the district court exceeded the statutory maximum sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-17\">Generally when an issue is not raised below, we review only for plain error. <em>United States v. Sias, </em>227 F.3d 244, 246 (5th Cir.2000). \u201cHowever, because a sentence which exceeds the statutory maximum is an illegal sentence and therefore constitutes plain error, our review of the issue presented in this appeal will be de novo.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b439-18\">Moreland\u2019s conviction for making false statements on his loan application to the FmHA carried with it the most severe penalty, up to 30 years of imprisonment. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number><em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1014. Thus, Moreland\u2019s conviction on these counts was for a Class B felony. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3559(a). Under the version of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(3) applicable to Moreland\u2019s 1998 convictions, the maximum cumulative term of imprisonment upon revocation to which Moreland was subject was 36 months. However, More-land had previously been sentenced to a total of ten months of imprisonment as a result of his two prior revocations in 2002 and 2006, and as a result of these two prior revocations, Moreland was serving only a single term of supervised release. Consequently, the maximum term of imprisonment to which Moreland could be sentenced following the third revocation was 26 months. Accordingly, as the Government concedes, the total sentence of 36 months imposed by the district court exceeded the statutory maximum and is illegal. Moreland\u2019s sentence is VACATED and the case is REMANDED for resentencing.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b439-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
