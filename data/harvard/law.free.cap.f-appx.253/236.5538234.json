Because no substantial question is presented by the appeal, we will grant Appellee\u2019s Motion for Summary Action and will affirm the District Court\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-24\">Elienist, a citizen of the Bahamas, is serving a prison sentence for his drug and counterfeit currency convictions. Elienist filed a \u00a7 2241 petition, arguing that he had been improperly designated by the Bureau of Prisons (BOP) as a \u201cdeportable alien,\u201d which prevented his transfer to a prison closer to his family in Florida.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-25\">The BOP uses a <em>Security Designation and Custody Classification Manual </em>to aid in determining inmate placements in federal facilities. The <em>Manual </em>lists nine Public Safety Factors (PSF) to be applied to inmates who are not appropriate for minimum security placements. One of the PSFs is the designation \u201cDeportable Alien.\u201d At the time of the decision Elienist complained of, such a designation was to be applied to an inmate who is a citizen of a foreign country unless he met each of three criteria. One criterium was that the inmate document or independently verify a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>history of stable employment for at least the three years immediately prior to incarceration; the other two required a verified history of five or more consecutive years of U.S. domicile and strong family ties. Program Statement (PS) 5100.07 (effective Sept. 3,1999-Sept. 12, 2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">Before filing his \u00a7 2241 petition, Elienist pursued internal prison remedies. In the Warden\u2019s response to his \u201cInmate Request to Staff Member,\u201d Elienist was informed of the three criteria of PS 5100.07, and was advised to address the issue with his \u201cUnit Team,\u201d which would be responsible for requesting a waiver of the PSF. The response indicated that Elienist should provide his Unit Team with adequate verification of the three criteria. Elienist appealed the response, and the Regional Director affirmed, noting that Elienist was \u201cpending participation in the immigration hearing process,\u201d and that his \u201cdeportation status ha[d] not yet been determined.\u201d The Regional Director informed Elienist that he could submit a transfer request if his status changed. Elienist appealed to the Administrator of National Inmate Appeals, who found that the \u201cWarden and the Regional Director adequately responded to the issue you raised in your appeal,\u201d and that the designation of \u201cDeportable Alien\u201d was appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-6\">Elienist\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition claimed that the BOP was not following its regulations. In its response, the respondent noted that Elienist\u2019s presentence investigation report showed that he had not had stable employment for the three years prior to his incarceration, and that he thus did not meet one of the criteria that would allow him to avoid the \u201cdeportable alien\u201d designation. In her Report and Recommendation (R&amp;R), the Magistrate Judge noted that Elienist had not satisfied the three criteria, and stated that the BOP therefore had correctly designated Elienist as a \u201cdeport-able alien.\u201d The District Court, after considering Eliemst\u2019s objections and the respondent\u2019s response thereto adopted the Magistrate Judge\u2019s Report and Recommendation as the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-8\">Elienist filed a motion for reconsideration, arguing that the Court had not considered the \u201cspecial circumstance\u201d (mentioned in his objections to the R&amp;R) that he was a juvenile for a portion of the three years before his incarceration, and thus could not have been expected (or even allowed) to have full-time employment. The District Court denied the motion for reconsideration, noting that it had already considered Elienist\u2019s special circumstance argument, and finding that his argument was moot. For the reasons that follow, we agree that Elienist\u2019s claims, which challenge PS 5100.07, are moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-9\">In its response to Petitioner\u2019s Objections to the Magistrate Judge\u2019s R&amp;R, the Warden noted that since the time the \u00a7 2241 petition was filed, PS 5100.08 was issued, superceding PS 5100.07. PS 5100.08 eliminates the three criteria mentioned in PS 5100.07. Elienist\u2019s custody classification was reviewed on October 3, 2006, using the new Program Statement. The PSF of \u201cdeportable alien\u201d was still found to be appropriate under the new Program Statement. Thus, Elienist\u2019s challenge to the criteria of 5100.07 is moot. Any challenge to the October 3, 2006 decision would have to be brought in a new petition, after exhausting administrative remedies.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-10\">For the foregoing reasons, we will affirm the District Court\u2019s order.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
