R.App. P. 34(a); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The cause is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b743-22\">ORDER AND JUDGMENT<footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<author id=\"b743-23\">TIMOTHY M. TYMKOVICH, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b743-24\">Carlos Humberto Reynoza-Maldonado pleaded guilty to reentry by a deported alien previously convicted of an aggravated felony in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1326(a)(1), (a)(2), and (b)(2). He was sentenced to 37 months imprisonment. On appeal to this court, Reynoza-Maldonado\u2019s counsel submitted a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), stating her belief that the defendant possessed no meritorious issues to appeal. The government did not submit a brief. ReynozaMaldonado was given time to file additional arguments with this court, but has failed to do so. <em>See Anders, </em>386 U.S. at 744, 87 S.Ct. 1396. After independently reviewing the record, we agree that Reynoza-Maldonado has no legally non-frivolous issues to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>appeal. His guilty plea was validly given and he has waived his right to challenge the sentence imposed upon him.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b744-4\">Reynoza-Maldonado\u2019s guilty plea was unquestionably valid under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11. The magistrate judge, serving at the plea hearing with the defendant\u2019s consent, performed a satisfactory Rule 11 colloquy. He determined, among other things, that Reynoza-Maldonado was fully competent and capable of entering an informed plea; that he was aware of the nature of the charges against him and the consequences of his plea; that there was an adequate factual basis for the plea; and that the plea was knowingly and voluntarily given. There are no grounds upon which Reynoza-Maldonado may successfully appeal his guilty plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-5\">Reynoza-Maldonado cannot appeal the sentence imposed upon him, because he has waived that right. Recognizing the value of plea bargaining to criminal defendants, the government, and the public, this court will generally enforce the waiver of appellate rights as part of a plea. <em>United States v. Hahn, </em>359 F.3d 1315, 1318, 1328 (10th Cir.2004) (en banc) (per curiam) (noting that for the government to receive the benefit of its bargain in a plea agreement, a defendant\u2019s knowing waiver of appeal should be upheld in an efficient manner). This court will enforce a criminal defendant\u2019s waiver of his right to appeal when: (1) \u201cthe disputed appeal falls within the scope of the waiver of appellate rights,\u201d (2) \u201cthe defendant knowingly and voluntarily waived his appellate rights,\u201d and (3) \u201cenforcing the waiver [will not] result in a miscarriage of justice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1325.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-6\">Pursuant to his plea agreement, Reynoza-Maldonado \u201cknowingly waive[d] the right to appeal any sentence within the statutory range applicable to the statute(s) of conviction.\u201d Plea Agreement at 5. The district court imposed a 37-month sentence, which is within the guideline range of 37 to 46 months established by the defendant\u2019s criminal history and offense level. Based on our review of the record, we are satisfied that the current appeal is within the scope of Reynoza-Maldonado\u2019s waiver, that the waiver was knowing and voluntary, and that enforcing the waiver would not result in a miscarriage of justice. <em>See Hahn, </em>359 F.3d at 1325-28. We therefore enforce the waiver.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-10\">For the reasons set forth above, we DISMISS Reynoza-Maldonado\u2019s appeal and GRANT his counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw from the case.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b743-25\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R.App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b744-7\">. Reynoza-Maldonado\u2019s appellate waiver prohibits an appeal of \u201cany sentence within the statutory range applicable to the statute(s) of conviction.\u201d Plea Agreement dated April 19, 2006, at 5.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
