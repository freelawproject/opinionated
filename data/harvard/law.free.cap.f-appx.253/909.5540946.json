Lin argues that the IJ erred because the IJ (1) erred in making an adverse credibility finding; and (2) denied her applications without considering all of the evidence presented; and (3) denied her applications despite the fact that she established her eligibility for asylum, withholding of removal, and CAT relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-13\">\n<em>Adverse Credibility</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b936-14\">\u201cWe review [our] subject matter jurisdiction <em>de novo.\u201d See Gonzalez-Oropeza v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>321 F.3d 1331, 1332 (11th Cir.2003). We lack jurisdiction to consider claims raised in a petition for review unless the petitioner exhausted her administrative remedies with respect to those claims. <em>See 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1); <em>Sundar v. I.N.S., </em>328 F.3d 1320, 1323 (11th Cir.2003). In order to exhaust all administrative remedies, an alien must raise her claims before the BIA. <em>Sundar, </em>328 F.3d at 1323; <em>Amaya-Artunduaga v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>463 F.3d 1247, 1250 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b936-15\">Because the record demonstrates that Lin failed to challenge the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination in her appeal to the BIA, we lack jurisdiction to consider that claim. <em>Amaya-Artunduaga, </em>463 F.3d at 1250. Accordingly, we dismiss the petition for review as to this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-16\">\n<em>The IJ\u2019s consideration of Lin\u2019s Evidence</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b936-17\">Because the BIA summarily affirmed the IJ without opinion, we review the IJ\u2019s opinion. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(e)(4); <em>Mendoza v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>327 F.3d 1283, 1284 n. 1 (11th Cir.2003). \u201cTo the extent that the [IJ\u2019s] decision was based on a legal determination, [our] review is <em>de novo.\u201d D-Muhumed v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>388 F.3d 814, 817 (11th Cir.2004). \u201cThe IJ\u2019s findings of fact are reviewed under the substantial evidence test, and we \u2018must affirm the IJ\u2019s decision if it is supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"911\">*911</page-number>dence on the record considered as a whole.\u2019 \u201d <em>Antipova v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>392 F.3d 1259, 1261 (11th Cir.2004) (quoting <em>Al Najjar v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1283-84 (11th Cir.2001)). In addition, we will only reverse the IJ if we find that the record compels that conclusion. <em>Fahim v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>278 F.3d 1216, 1218 (11th Cir.2002). However, an issue is abandoned if an appellant does not argue the issue in her brief. <em>Sepulveda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1228 n. 2 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b937-5\">An alien who arrives in, or is present in, the United States may apply for asylum. INA \u00a7 208(a)(1), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(1). The Attorney General or Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security has discretion to grant asylum if the alien meets the INA\u2019s definition of a \u201crefugee.\u201d INA \u00a7 208(b)(1), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(1). A \u201crefugee\u201d is defined in the INA as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ads\">any person who is outside any country of such person\u2019s nationality ... and who is unable or unwilling to return to, and is unable or unwilling to avail himself or herself of the protection of, that country because of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b937-6\">INA \u00a7 101(a)(42)(A), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A). The INA also provides that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b937-8\">a person who has been forced to abort a pregnancy or to undergo involuntary sterilization, or who has been persecuted for failure or refusal to undergo such a procedure or for other resistance to a coercive population control program, shall be deemed to have been persecuted on account of political opinion, and a person who has a well founded fear that he or she will be forced to undergo such a procedure or subject to persecution for such failure, refusal, or resistance shall be deemed to have a well founded fear of persecution on account of political opinion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b937-10\">INA \u00a7 101(a)(42)(B), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b937-12\">To qualify for withholding of removal under the INA, an alien must show that if returned to her country, the alien\u2019s life or freedom would be threatened on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion. INA \u00a7 241(b)(3), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3). To be entitled to relief under CAT, an applicant must establish that it is \u201cmore likely than not that he or she would be tortured if removed to the proposed country of removal.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b937-13\">If credible, an alien\u2019s testimony may be sufficient, without corroboration, to sustain her burden of proof in establishing her eligibility for relief from removal. <em>Forgue v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1282, 1287 (11th Cir.2005). \u201cConversely, an adverse credibility determination alone may be sufficient to support the denial of an asylum application.\u201d <em>Id. </em>However, \u201can adverse credibility determination does not alleviate the IJ\u2019s duty to consider other evidence produced by an asylum applicant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>If an applicant produces evidence beyond her testimony, \u201cit is not sufficient for the IJ to rely solely on an adverse credibility determination in those instances.\u201d <em>Id. </em>As long as all the evidence submitted by the applicant is considered, however, the IJ does not need to address specifically every piece of evidence presented. <em>Tan v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>446 F.3d 1369, 1374 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b937-14\">As an initial matter, Lin\u2019s arguments on appeal all relate to her claim that she fears that she will be persecuted because, by having two children since coming to the United States, she has violated China\u2019s family laws. Therefore, she has aban<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"912\">*912</page-number>doned the claims she made before the IJ that she will be persecuted because of other grounds. <em>See Sepulveda, </em>401 F.3d at 1228 n. 2. In addition, as previously discussed, Lin cannot challenge the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination because she failed to raise that claim before the BIA. Despite this adverse credibility finding, however, the IJ still must consider all of the evidence in the record and, in this case, the IJ failed to do so. <em>See Forgue, </em>401 F.3d at 1287.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-4\">Lin submitted supporting documentary evidence to the IJ in the form of a copy of the Population and Family Planning Law of China, 2002 Congressional testimony of John Aird on China\u2019s Family Planning Law, and an article from the World Socialist Web Site. In his decision, however, the IJ stated, \u201cOther than her oral testimony, [Lin] has not produced supporting documentation or explained the absence of such documentation.\u201d Based on this, it appears that the IJ not only failed to consider Lin\u2019s supporting documentary evidence, but also based his denial of Lin\u2019s claims in part on his incorrect belief that she had not submitted any such evidence. Thus, substantial evidence does not support the IJ\u2019s decision to deny Lin\u2019s application for asylum, withholding of removal, and CAT relief. <em>See Forgue, </em>401 F.3d at 1287. Accordingly, we vacate and remand the IJ\u2019s decision for further consideration with respect to Lin\u2019s claim that she fears she will be persecuted because she has had two children while in the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-5\">PETITION DISMISSED IN PART, GRANTED IN PART, AND REMANDED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
