BATCHELDER, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b522-12\">Petitioner Raymond L. Covington appeals the district court\u2019s dismissal of his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 petition for habeas corpus. Covington cites five instances of ineffective assistance of trial counsel that warrant reversal of the dismissal of his petition: (1) counsel\u2019s failure to investigate the circumstances of a letter challenging the credibility of the State\u2019s key witness; (2) counsel\u2019s failure to subpoena Covington\u2019s co-defendant, whose testimony would have supported Covington\u2019s explanation of events; (3) counsel\u2019s failure to enhance a tape-recorded conversation between Covington and the State\u2019s key witness; (4) counsel\u2019s failure to object to the handwritten amendment of Covington\u2019s indictment; and (5) counsel\u2019s failure to appropriately advise Covington concerning whether he should testify. Because Covington provides no basis on which to grant habeas relief, we affirm the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-13\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b522-14\">The following facts are taken from Covington\u2019s direct appeal to the Tennessee Court of Criminal Appeals. <em>See State v. Covington, </em>No. 01C01-9109-CC-00267, 1992 WL 99060, 1992 Tenn.Crim.App. LEXIS 392 (Tenn.Crim.App. May 13, 1992).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-15\">This case concerns the killing of Ernie Anglin on April 14, 1979. Bonnie Parker, the mother of Mr. Anglin\u2019s daughter, was living with Mr. Anglin on the date of his death. According to her testimony, two masked men entered their house at approximately 9:30 p.m. Brandishing weapons, they took a substantial amount of cash from Anglin\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>pants pocket and then led him out of the house while pointing a gun at his back. The victim\u2019s four-year-old daughter was a witness to this robbery and abduction. The little girl was crying hysterically while her mother, Ms. Parker, desperately sought help. She called a Mend; but before anyone arrived, Ms. Parker heard two gunshots from across the street. Shortly thereafter, Ernie Anglin was found dead on the ground with two gunshots to his body.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-5\">Sheriffs investigations led to Greg Hill as a possible suspect. [In July 1990,] Hill made a statement to law enforcement officers implicating himself, the appellant, and a man named Ronnie Brown. Hill agreed to allow himself to be wired and to engage in a conversation with the appellant. The conversation was videotaped and recorded. During the taped conversation, the appellant admitted robbing and shooting Anglin. The court reporter had difficulty hearing every word of the tape and would certify the transcript of the recording as a \u201cbest effort\u201d only. According to the court reporter, a portion of the tape was as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-6\">Mr. Hill: Hey, Ray-Ray?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-7\">Mr. Covington: What?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-8\">Mr. Hill: There\u2019s something I always wanted to ask you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-9\">Mr. Covington: What?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-10\">Mr. Hill: That night you shot old Ernie, that night,\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-11\">Mr. Covington: Uh-huh.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-12\">Mr. Hill: \u2014 You didn\u2019t mean to shoot the mother-fucker, did you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-13\">Mr. Covington: No, I told you he backed into the gun.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-14\">Mr. Hill: He backed into the shotgun?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-15\">Mr. Covington: Oh, you know, I had him, and we was walking out with him. Right? Right? I was behind him and he was in front of me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-17\">Mr. Hill: uh-huh.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-18\">Mr. Covington: And he stopped. And I\u2019m looking back, and not paying attention to him, and when he stopped, I\u2019m, like that there, jammed into him, and the mother-fucker went off. * * * Think I was trying to kill him? No, I wasn\u2019t trying to kill him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-19\">Mr. Hill: Well, see, somebody, they thought, at one time that Ronnie had a contract out on him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-20\">Mr. Covington: Yeah.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-21\">Mr. Hill: You know, Ronnie was going to get some money off of him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-22\">Mr. Covington: You don\u2019t think I wanted to kill him? Shit.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-23\">Mr. Hill: I know that\u2019s right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-24\">Mr. Covington: I done got what I wanted and got out of there.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-25\">Mr. Hill: I know that\u2019s right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-26\">Mr. Covington: No, that mother-fucker stopped, man. He stopped.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-27\">Mr. Hill: I figured that what it was.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-28\">Mr. Covington: When he stopped\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-29\">Mr. Hill: An accident.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-30\">Mr. Covington: When he stopped, I nudged him, \u2018cause, hey, it scared me.... Yeah, he stopped and he nudged that shotgun, and when it went off, you talking about \u2014 got where I panicked. It scared me, more than it did \u2014 well, it didn\u2019t scare him, \u2018cause he was through. Mr. Hill: (Laughter.) It was all over for him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-31\">Mr. Covington: It scared the hell out of me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-32\">Mr. Hill: He was dead then.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-33\">Mr. Covington: That mother-fucker</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-34\">went off twice, quickly.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-35\">Mr. Hill: I thought I heard two shots. Mr. Covington: That\u2019s an automatic. That\u2019s one of them automatics..</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>The videotape as well as the taped recorded conversation was played for the jury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-4\">Greg Hill testified at trial. In March of 1979, he, Ronald Brown, and Ray Covington made plans to rob Ernie Anglin, who was known to carry large sums of money. They selected April 14th as the date of the robbery. They met at Brown\u2019s apartment at 7:00 p.m. to discuss the robbery. They left the apartment carrying a shotgun, a pistol, and two ski masks. Hill testified that at approximately 8:30 he dropped the other two off near Anglin\u2019s house. Thirty minutes later he heard two shots. Brown and Covington came running back to the car and as they got in, Hill drove off. Brown and Covington were arguing. Brown stated, \u201cyou done killed him\u201d; and Covington replied that he didn\u2019t mean to, that the gun went off accidentally. Hill testified about wearing the hidden microphone and engaging in a conversation about the homicide with the appellant. Hill further testified that the excerpts from the transcript [as set forth above] essentially represent the conversation that he remembers.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-5\">The appellant testified on his own behalf. His explanation of the events of April 14, 1979, is vague and somewhat confusing. A summary of his testimony is as follows: Hill and Riley Cooper went to the appellant\u2019s house to get a shotgun the appellant had borrowed from Ronnie Brown. The appellant refused to give the gun to the two men, but said he would go with them to take it back to Brown. Hill drove to a spot near Ernie Anglin\u2019s house; Hill and Cooper got out of the car; and appellant stayed in the car. He contended that he was unaware of the reason for stopping near Anglin\u2019s house. The appellant then got out and took the path the other two men had taken. He saw them with Ernie Anglin. Cooper was behind Anglin with a shotgun. The appellant contends that he [appellant] bumped into the shotgun and it went off twice, and then they all ran back to the car.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b524-8\"><em>Id. </em>at *1-2, 1992 Tenn.Crim.App. LEXIS 392 at *1-6.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-9\">The jury convicted Covington of felony murder and robbery by use of a deadly weapon. He received a life sentence for the murder and a ten-year sentence, to run concurrently, for the robbery. On direct appeal, the Tennessee Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed Covington\u2019s convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-10\">Covington then pursued state post-conviction relief, alleging ineffective assistance of trial counsel. Following the dismissal of his post-conviction petition, he appealed to the Tennessee Court of Criminal Appeals, which affirmed the dismissal of Covington\u2019s petition. Covington then submitted to the Tennessee Supreme Court an application for discretionary review, which the Tennessee Supreme Court denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-11\">On January 24, 1997, Covington filed a pro se petition for habeas corpus relief. Counsel was appointed and filed an amended petition on February 17, 1998. Covington\u2019s petition alleged, among other claims, the ineffective assistance of trial counsel. In 2002 <footnotemark>1</footnotemark>, the district court dismissed eight ineffective assistance sub-claims as procedurally defaulted because Covington failed to present them to the Tennessee Supreme Court in his appliea<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>tion for discretionary review: trial counsel\u2019s failure (1) to request discovery; (2) to investigate the ease; (3) to develop a coherent theory of defense; (4) to seek expert assistance to enhance the quality of a tape recording that was received in evidence; (5) to provide sound advice to Covington as to the exercise of his right to testify; (6) to object to an improper jury instruction on reasonable doubt; (7) to raise or preserve the issue of sufficiency of the evidence; and (8) to object to a handwritten amendment of the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">On appeal, we reversed, concluding that Covington had fairly presented four instances of ineffective assistance to the Tennessee Court of Criminal Appeals, and remanded with instructions for the district court to consider on the merits those four instances of ineffective assistance: trial counsel\u2019s (1) failure to investigate the case; (2) failure to seek expert assistance to enhance the quality of a tape recording that was received into evidence; (3) failure to provide sound advice to Covington as to the exercise of his right to testify; and (4) failure to object to a handwritten amendment of the indictment. <em>Covington v. Mills, </em>110 Fed.Appx. 663, 665-66 (6th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b525-6\">On September 9, 2005, the district court dismissed the petition. Covington timely noticed an appeal, and the district court subsequently issued a Certificate of Appealability as to all four instances of ineffective assistance.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b525-9\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b525-10\">We review <em>da novo </em>the district court\u2019s denial of Covington\u2019s petition for writ of habeas corpus. <em>Clinkscale v. Carter, </em>375 F.3d 430, 435 (6th Cir.2004). An \u201cineffective assistance of counsel claim is a mixed question of law and fact, for which district-court determinations are subject to <em>da novo </em>review.\u201d <em>Lucas v. O\u2019Dea, </em>179 F.3d 412, 416 (6th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b525-11\">Because Covington filed his habeas petition after April 24, 1996, the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 (\u201cAEDPA\u201d), applies to this case. Section 2254(d) provides that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-12\">An application for a writ of habeas corpus on behalf of a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a State court shall not be granted with respect to any claim that was adjudicated on the merits in State court proceedings unless the adjudication of the claim\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-13\">(1) resulted in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>(2) resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b526-4\">In order to establish ineffective assistance of counsel, Covington must demonstrate both components of the claim:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-5\">First, the defendant must show that counsel\u2019s performance was deficient.... Second, the defendant must show that the deficient performance prejudiced the defense. This requires showing that counsel\u2019s errors were so serious as to deprive the defendant of a fair trial, a trial whose result is reliable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b526-6\"><em>Strickland, v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). \u201cWhen determining prejudice, the Court must consider the errors of counsel in total, against the totality of the evidence in the case.\u201d <em>Stewart v. Wolfenbarger, </em>468 F.3d 338, 361 (6th Cir.2006) (citing <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 695-96, 104 S.Ct. 2052).</p>\n<p id=\"b526-7\">On appeal, Covington raises five instances of ineffective assistance of trial counsel. First, prior to trial, Covington provided trial counsel with a letter from Pete Bondurant, an inmate at the Lawrence County Jail where Hill also was incarcerated, in which Bondurant stated that Hill was bragging to inmates about pulling a fast one on the district attorney\u2019s office. The letter, dated February 22, 1991 (shortly before the start of Covington\u2019s trial), read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AJA\">Tell Ray-Ray [Covington] that MotherFucker Hill is sitting in the Second Drunk Tank of the Lawrence County Jail reviewing notes [District Attorney] Bottoms gave him yesterday. Trusttees told me they were all over the fucking place. Hill told me \u201cHe wasn\u2019t going to take no fall so long as the D.A. was a Sucker.\u201d Man that Motherfucker is Treacherous.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b526-8\"><em>Covington v. Mills, </em>No. 1:97-0013, 2005 WL 2204976, at *6, 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 33022, at *14 (M.D.Tenn. Sept. 9, 2005). Covington alleges that trial counsel failed to investigate the letter: he did not interview Bondurant or the inmates mentioned in the letter, nor did trial counsel subpoena Bondurant (or anyone else who might have information regarding this letter or Hill\u2019s statements).</p>\n<p id=\"b526-10\">Second, Covington argues that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to subpoena Ronnie Brown (and Brown\u2019s alibi witnesses) who would testify that Ronnie Brown was not present at Anglin\u2019s house that night \u2014 directly contradicting Hill\u2019s testimony that Brown participated in the robbery and killing of Anglin. Third, Covington argues that counsel was ineffective for failing to enhance the tape-recording of his conversation with Hill because an enhancement \u201cmay have revealed that the words were different than those transcribed, in a way helpful to the defense.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Br. 32.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-11\">Fourth, Covington argues that he did not consent to the handwritten amendment of his indictment, and trial counsel was ineffective for failing to object to the amendment. And fifth, Covington argues that his trial counsel was ineffective because he failed to explain to him Tennessee\u2019s corroboration rule (a defendant cannot be convicted solely upon the uncorroborated testimony of an accomplice), which meant that Covington\u2019s own testimony could be used to corroborate Hill\u2019s testimony that Covington participated in Anglin\u2019s robbery/murder. Nor did trial counsel discuss the amendment of the indictment with him. Covington claims that because of these failures on the part of his counsel, he believed that the State was required to prove that he deliberately or with premeditation killed Anglin, and he therefore testified in order to show that the shooting was accidental. Covington contends that had he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>known any of this, he would not have testified.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">At the outset, we conclude that Covington\u2019s second subclaim \u2014 trial counsel\u2019s failure to subpoena Brown \u2014 is not properly before us. Covington labeled this subclaim as an independent subclaim in his habeas petition (\u201cC. Counsel Failed to Seek or Subpoena Exculpatory Witnesses\u201d), and it was not included in our order of remand to the district court. The district court, therefore, did not consider this claim on its merits, and we will not address it for the first time on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-6\">Covington does not challenge the legal standard applied by the Tennessee Court of Criminal Appeals to his claims of ineffective assistance of counsel; rather, he quarrels with its application of the law to his facts. Applying <em>Strickland, </em>the Tennessee Court of Criminal Appeals concluded that trial counsel\u2019s decision not to call Bondurant to testify was strategic, and therefore not deficient:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-7\">Trial counsel also explained his decision not to call Pete Bondurant as a witness. Bondurant had written a letter to his brother, Pat, in which he claimed that Hill had said that \u201che wasn\u2019t going to take no fall so long as the D.A. was a sucker.\u201d While this statement would have cast doubt upon the truthfulness of Hill\u2019s testimony, trial counsel was concerned about the credibility of the Bondurants; both were in jail on second degree murder charges at the time of the communication. Pete Bondurant would have been fair game for impeachment by his prior criminal record. Trial counsel believed that any possible success in the trial hinged upon the credibility of the defense and that the Bondurant participation presented a risk to that strategy.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b527-8\"><em>Covington v. State, </em>No. 01C01-9408-CC-00286, 1996 WL 10084, at *2 (Tenn.Crim. App. Jan.ll, 1996). We note as well that, even without further pursuing the Bondurant letter, for example, by interviewing the prison trustees mentioned in the letter, trial counsel was able to impeach Hill at trial. On cross examination, Hill affirmed that he would be \u201cwilling to say anything to get out of jail\u201d; Hill admitted that he \u201cplayed crazy\u201d in jail in an effort to get out; and trial counsel questioned Hill about his criminal record (which included forging his father\u2019s name on checks). Covington cannot show prejudice from his trial counsel\u2019s decision not to pursue Bondurant or the letter.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-10\">Likewise, the Tennessee Court of Criminal Appeals concluded that trial counsel\u2019s decision not to enhance the tape was strategic: \u201c[trial counsel] believed that a more accurate transcript might have further incriminated the petitioner. The poor quality of the tape offered the petitioner an opportunity to impeach Hill about the tape.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b527-11\">\u201c[A] court must indulge a strong presumption that counsel\u2019s conduct falls within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance; that is, the defendant must overcome the presumption that, under the circumstances, the challenged action \u2018might be considered sound trial strategy.\u2019\u201d <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 689, 104 S.Ct. 2052 (quoting <em>Michel v. Louisiana, </em>350 U.S. 91, 101, 76 S.Ct. 158, 100 L.Ed. 83 (1955)). The Tennessee court\u2019s conclusions were not an unreasonable application of, nor contrary to, <em>Strickland.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b527-12\">Hill\u2019s remaining instances of ineffective assistance \u2014 the amendment to the indictment and counsel\u2019s alleged failure to explain to Covington the ramifications of that amendment with regard to Covington\u2019s testifying at trial \u2014 fail because he cannot show prejudice resulting from trial counsel\u2019s performance. Because the state <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>courts did not address these subclaims, we cannot review a decision to determine whether it is an unreasonable application of, or contrary to, Supreme Court precedent. <em>See Clinkscale, </em>375 F.3d at 436 (\u201cIn this case, no state court has adjudicated the merits of Clinkscale\u2019s ineffective assistance claim. Therefore, the deferential standard of review set forth in section 2254(d) is inapplicable.\u201d). Instead, we review the remaining subclaims to determine if Hill\u2019s trial counsel was ineffective under <em>Strickland\u2019s </em>standards. <em>See id. </em>at 442 (Though <em>de novo, </em>\u201c[o]ur review of Clinkscale\u2019s ineffective assistance claim is governed by the familiar two-prong test set forth in <em>Strickland.\u201d).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b528-4\">Covington was indicted for first degree murder, in violation of Tenn.Code Ann. \u00a7 39-2-202. He claims that his counsel was ineffective because he failed to object to the handwritten amendment to the indictment, which deleted the premeditated murder language and substituted felony-murder language \u2014 either of which constituted first degree murder. Covington concedes that this claim is foreclosed by our decision in <em>Blake v. Morford, </em>563 F.2d 248 (6th Cir.1977), but argues that this result is fundamentally unfair. We disagree. Under Tennessee\u2019s 1979 first degree murder statute, the State could prosecute first degree murder by establishing premeditated murder, i.e., \u201ccommon law\u201d murder, or by establishing that the defendant committed the murder during the perpetration of a felony, such as robbery. The intent to commit the felony served as the legal equivalent for the intent required for premeditation. The amendment of the indictment, which was procedurally proper under Tennessee law, <em>see </em>Tenn. R.Crim. P. 7(b)(2), did not add or change the offense with which Covington was charged, nor did the amendment deprive him of notice of the charges he faced. As was the case in <em>Blake, </em>Covington suffered no prejudice as a result of the amendment to the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-6\">Finally, Covington cannot show prejudice as a result of his counsel\u2019s failure to explain to him the ramifications of that amendment. Even without Covington\u2019s testimony, the jury had before it Hill\u2019s testimony, the taped conversation between Hill and Covington, and a \u201cbest effort\u201d transcript of that conversation \u2014 all of which indicated that Covington was involved in Anglin\u2019s robbery and death.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-7\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b528-8\">For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b524-6\">. In March of 1998, the district court dismissed Covington\u2019s petition, without prejudice, because it construed the petition as a successive habeas petition. A panel of this Court reversed the dismissal and remanded to the district court with instructions to consider Covington's habeas petition on the merits. <em>See Covington v. Mills, </em>No. 98-5879, 1999 WL 96646, 1999 U.S.App. LEXIS 2002 (6th Cir. Feb. 4, 1999).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b525-7\">. The State argues that we should find two instances of Covington's ineffective assistance claim \u2014 the amending of the indictment and Covington\u2019s testifying \u2014 procedurally defaulted even though our prior remand directed the district court to consider on the merits these two instances of ineffective assistance. While the State acknowledges that normally the law of the case applies, it argues that we should not apply the doctrine here. \u201c The [law of the case] doctrine precludes our reconsideration of the [previously decided issue] unless one of three \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d exists,\u2019 \u201d <em>Coal Res., Inc. v. Gulf &amp; W. Indus., Inc., </em>865 F.2d 761, 767 (6th Cir.1989) (citation omitted): \"(1) where substantially different evidence is raised on subsequent trial; (2) where a subsequent contrary view of the law is decided by the controlling authority; or (3) where a decision is clearly erroneous and would work a manifest injustice,\u201d <em>Hanover Ins.

Russell, </em>432 F.3d 668, 677 (6th Cir.2005) (internal punctuation and citation omitted).
