Fed. R.App. P. 4(b)(1)(A). With or without a motion, upon a showing of excusable neglect or good cause, the district court may grant an extension of up to thirty days to file a notice of appeal. Fed. R.App. P. 4(b)(4); <em>United States v. Reyes, </em>759 F.2d 351, 353 (4th Cir.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b280-7\">The district court denied Crews\u2019 \u201cRenewed Motion to Waive Fine\u201d by order entered on September 20, 2006, and denied his motion for reconsideration of that order by order entered on December 8, 2006. Crews filed his notice of appeal on January 10, 2007,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> after the ten-day appeal period expired but within the thirty-day excusable neglect period. Because the notice of appeal was filed within the excusable neglect period, we remand the case to the district court for the court to determine whether Crews has shown excusable neglect or good cause warranting an extension of the ten-day appeal period. The record, as supplemented, will then be returned to this court for further consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-8\">\n<em>REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b280-24\"><em> See Houston v.
