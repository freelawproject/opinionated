The BIA denied petitioner\u2019s motion to terminate removal proceedings, rejecting petitioner\u2019s argument that the government should be equitably estopped from denying that petitioner derived citizenship from his mother under former 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1432 (repealed 2000), which was in effect at the time Gray turned eighteen. Further, the BIA found that petitioner was barred from seeking cancellation of removal under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(a)(3) because he had been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>convicted of an aggravated felony. <em>In re Ellis Joseph Gray, </em>No. A 41 926 232 (B.I.A. Oct. 17, 2005), <em>aff'g </em>No. A 41 926 232 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City, July 13, 2005). We assume the parties\u2019 and counsel\u2019s familiarity with the facts and procedural history of this case, and the scope of the issues presented by this petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-4\">During oral argument, petitioner appeared to abandon the argument that but for the INS\u2019s unreasonable delay in processing his mother\u2019s application for naturalization he would have met the material conditions for derivative citizenship under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1432 and that, therefore, the government should be equitably estopped from denying that he derived citizenship under the statute. The argument was in any event without merit. \u201cThe doctrine of equitable estoppel is not available against the government except in the most serious of circumstances and is applied with the utmost caution and restraint. Specifically, estoppel will only be applied upon a showing of affirmative misconduct by the government.\u201d <em>Rojas-Reyes v. I.N.S., </em>235 F.3d 115, 126 (2d Cir.2000) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). A showing \u201conly that the Government failed to process promptly an application falls far short of establishing [affirmative misconduct].\u201d <em>INS v. Miranda, </em>459 U.S. 14, 19, 103 S.Ct. 281, 74 L.Ed.2d 12 (1982). Thus, \u201cunexplained delay in processing does not give rise to estoppel.\u201d <em>Dhine v. Slattery, </em>3 F.3d 613, 618 (2d Cir.1993). Accordingly, there was no showing of affirmative misconduct here.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-5\">The BIA also properly determined that petitioner\u2019s conviction of attempted criminal possession of a controlled substance qualifies as a conviction of an aggravated felony and bars petitioner from obtaining discretionary relief in the form of cancellation of removal under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(a)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b106-7\">As defined in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101, \u201c[t]he term \u2018aggravated felony\u2019 [encompasses] ... illicit trafficking in a controlled substance (as defined in section 802 of Title 21), including a drug trafficking crime (as defined in section 924(c) of Title 18).\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(B). An \u201cattempt ... to commit\u201d illicit trafficking in controlled substances is also an aggravated felony. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(U). 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924 further specifies that \u201cthe term \u2018drug trafficking crime\u2019 means any felony punishable under the Controlled Substances Act (CSA)(21 U.S.C. \u00a7 801 et seq.), the Controlled Substances Import and Export Act (21 U.S.C. \u00a7 951 et seq.), or chapter 705 of title 46.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b106-8\">Petitioner was convicted under New York law of attempted criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree. \u201cA person is guilty of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree when he knowingly and unlawfully possesses ... a narcotic drug with intent to sell it.\u201d N.Y. Penal L. \u00a7 220.16(1) (McKinney 2000). This crime is a Class B felony under New York law, <em>id., </em>and an attempt to commit this crime is a Class C felony under New York law, N.Y. Penal L. \u00a7 110.05(4) (McKinney 2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b106-9\">\u201c[A] state offense constitutes a \u2018felony punishable under the Controlled Substances Act\u2019 only if it proscribes conduct punishable as a felony under that federal law.\u201d <em>Lopez v. Gonzales, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 625, 633, 166 L.Ed.2d 462 (2006). \u201c[T]he crimes the [Controlled Substances Act] defines as \u2018felonies\u2019 are those crimes to which it assigns a punishment exceeding one year\u2019s imprisonment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 631 n. 7. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>Under the Controlled Substances Act, it is a crime for \u201cany person knowingly or intentionally ... [to] possess with intent to manufacture, distribute, or dispense, a controlled substance.\u201d 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1). This crime is punishable by a term of imprisonment greater than one year, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(C), and, therefore, constitutes a felony under the CSA. And because the CSA dictates that attempt offenses are \u201csubject to the same penalties as those prescribed for the offense [itself],\u201d 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846, attempted possession of a controlled substance with intent to distribute is also a felony under the CSA.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-5\">The BIA correctly concluded that the conduct proscribed by N.Y. Penal L. \u00a7\u00a7 220.16(1) and 110, the New York statutes under which petitioner was convicted, would also be punishable under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1) and 846 of the CSA. Consequently, petitioner has been convicted of an aggravated felony and is barred from cancellation of removal by the terms of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(a)(3). Petitioner\u2019s argument that the plain meaning of drug trafficking does not comport with the conduct for which he was convicted is meritless.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-6\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review of the order of the Board of Immigration Appeals is hereby DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
