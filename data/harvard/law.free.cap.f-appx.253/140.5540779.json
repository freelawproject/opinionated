Horn that denied her application for cancellation of removal under section 240A(b)(l) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(b)(l). <em>See In re Fatoumata Keita, </em>No. A 98 415 444 (B.I.A. Oct. 19, 2006), <em>aff'g </em>No. A 98 415 444 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City Apr. 19, 2005). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the facts, the issues on appeal, and the procedural history.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-20\">We lack jurisdiction to review the discretionary and factual determinations underlying the denial of an application for cancellation of removal. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)(i); <em>De La Vega v. Gonzales, </em>436 F.3d 141, 144 (2d Cir.2006). We do, however, have jurisdiction to review \u201cchallenges to the exercise of routine dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>cretion\u201d that \u201craise \u2018constitutional claims or questions of law.\u2019 \u201d <em>De La Vega, </em>436 F.3d at 146; <em>see also </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D).</p>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">Keita contends that the BIA denied her a full and fair opportunity to present her application for cancellation of removal by refusing to (1) consider the new evidence she sought to offer on appeal or (2) construe her pro <em>se </em>brief to the BIA as a motion to remand based on newly acquired evidence. We conclude that, although Keita frames her petition for review as a due process challenge to the BIA\u2019s determination, her claim essentially amounts to a disagreement with the manner in which the IJ and BIA exercised their discretion. We therefore dismiss her petition. <em>Cf. Barco-Sandoval v. Gonzales, </em>496 F.3d 132, 136 (2d Cir.2007) (noting that we lack \u201cjurisdiction to review decisions under the INA when the petition for review essentially disputes ... the wisdom of [an agency\u2019s] exercise of discretion and raises neither a constitutional claim nor a question of law\u201d) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b167-6\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DISMISSED. As we have completed our review, Keita\u2019s pending motion for a stay of removal is DISMISSED as moot.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
