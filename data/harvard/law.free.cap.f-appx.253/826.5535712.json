After review, we deny Boraelus\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-10\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b853-11\">Bornelus, a native and citizen of Haiti, filed an application for asylum, withholding of removal and relief under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d), contending that he was persecuted in Haiti on account of his political opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-12\">According to Bornelus\u2019s application and hearing testimony, he operated a store with his brother in City Soliel, Haiti. In April 2003, while Bornelus was out buying goods for the store, a group known as the \u201cChimere\u201d entered the store, killed his brother and burned the store down.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-13\">The Chimere is an armed gang linked to the Fanmi Lavalas Party supported by former President Jean-Bertrand Aristide. The Chimere killed Bornelus\u2019s brother because he was involved in politics and opposed the Fanmi Lavalas Party.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-14\">The Chimere then fired shots in the air and told witnesses outside the store that if the Chimere found Bornelus, they would kill him because they believed Bornelus would seek revenge for his brother\u2019s death. Some of the witnesses found Bornelus at his warehouse and told him of his brother\u2019s death and the Chimere\u2019s death threat. Bornelus immediately went into hiding and fled to the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-15\">At the asylum hearing, Bornelus testified that he was not involved in politics and was unaware of his brother\u2019s political involvement before the April 2003 incident. Bornelus stated that he disliked polities and did not discuss politics with his brother. When asked why he felt the need to go into hiding if he was not involved in politics, Bornelus responded that the Chimere \u201cwere after me because they think that I would go to revenge, to get revenge for my brother.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b853-16\">The IJ denied Bornelus\u2019s application for asylum, withholding of removal and CAT relief. The IJ found Bornelus\u2019s testimony to be incredible. Alternatively, the IJ concluded that, even if he accepted Bornelus\u2019s testimony as true, the persecution alleged in Bornelus\u2019s story was not \u201con account of one of the five grounds set forth in the Act,\u201d but \u201cis based upon a fear that someone would harm him because he would either report the crime or take revenge.\u201d The IJ found that Bornelus\u2019s story \u201cis certainly not based upon political opinion or even an imputed political opinion....\u201d The IJ fux\u2019ther found that \u201cthis respondent has absolutely no knowledge of any political opinion expressed by his brother, nor could he articulate any imputed or actual opinion his brother had expressed or was known to have been persecuted.\u201d Thus, the IJ concluded that Bornelus was not eligible for asylum or withholding of re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"828\">*828</page-number>moval.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b854-4\">Bornelus appealed to the BIA. The BIA found that the IJ had clearly erred when he failed to provide a specific basis for his adverse credibility determination. Nonetheless, the BIA affirmed the IJ\u2019s decision, finding that Bornelus \u201cdid not demonstrate that the harm he fears is on account of an enumerated ground of persecution in the Act.\u201d The BIA explained that, although Bornelus claimed that he \u201cwill be targeted on account of an imputed political opinion, [Bornelus] testified that he feared harm from Lavalas Chimere, because they believed that he would seek revenge for his brother\u2019s death....\u201d The BIA concluded that \u201crevenge or personal retribution does not constitute persecution on account of political opinion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b854-5\">Bornelus filed this petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-6\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b854-7\">On appeal, Bornelus argues that he suffered past persecution and has a well-founded fear of future persecution on account of an imputed political opinion because, after murdering his brother, the Chimere , destroyed Bornelus\u2019s business and threatened his life.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Chimere made the death threat because they believed that Bornelus would seek revenge for his brother\u2019s murder. Bornelus argues that, in Haiti, political opinions are \u201coftentimes expressed through violence,\u201d and vengeance \u201cis political expression.\u201d According to Bornelus, an act of vengeance by him \u201cwould be considered a political act by Chimeres.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b854-12\">To establish asylum eligibility, an applicant must, with specific and credible evidence, establish: (1) past persecution on account of a statutorily listed ground, or (2) a well-founded fear that the statutorily listed ground will cause future persecution. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(a),(b); <em>Ruiz v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>440 F.3d 1247, 1257 (11th Cir.2006). If an asylum applicant establishes past persecution on a protected ground, he is presumed to have a well-founded fear of future persecution and the burden shifts to the government to demonstrate that either conditions in the home country have changed or the applicant could avoid persecution by relocating within the home country and that relocation is reasonable. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(b)(l)(i)(A)-(B).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b854-13\">It is well-settled that persecution on account of political opinion \u201c \u2018is persecution on account of the <em>victim\u2019s </em>political opinion, not the persecutor\u2019s.\u2019 \u201d <em>Sanchez v. U.S. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"829\">*829</page-number><em>Att\u2019y Gen., </em>392 F.3d 434, 437-38 (11th Cir.2004) (quoting <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 482, 112 S.Ct. 812, 816, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992)). A political opinion may be imputed if the persecutors mistakenly attribute a political opinion to the asylum applicant \u201cand then persecuted him because of that mistaken belief about his views.\u201d <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1289 (brackets omitted). To warrant a reversal of a finding that an alien failed to demonstrate a sufficient nexus between the alleged persecution and the alien\u2019s actual or imputed political opinion, \u201cwe must be compelled to find that the alien will be persecuted <em>\u2018because of\u2019 </em>his political opinion.\u201d <em>Rodriguez Morales v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>488 F.3d 884, 890 (11th Cir.2007) (quoting <em>Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. at 483, 112 S.Ct. at 816).</p>\n<p id=\"b855-5\">Here, the IJ found that there was no nexus between the alleged persecution or the fear of future persecution and Bornelus\u2019s political opinion. After review, we conclude that the record does not compel a finding to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-6\">Because we take Bornelus\u2019s testimony as true, we do not doubt that the Chimere killed Bornelus\u2019s brother on account of his brother\u2019s political opinion. However, it is Bornelus\u2019s political opinion, not his brother\u2019s, that must have motivated the alleged persecution for Bornelus to be eligible for asylum and withholding of removal. Bornelus admits that he was politically neutral in Haiti and does not claim persecution because of his actual political opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-7\">Instead, Bornelus contends that he was persecuted for an <em>imputed </em>political opinion. However, Bornelus does not claim that the Chimere mistakenly believed that he shared his brother\u2019s political opinion. Indeed, it is undisputed that the Chimere\u2019s interest in Bornelus results not from a belief that Bornelus holds political views, but from a belief that Bornelus wants to avenge his brother\u2019s murder. The Chimere targeted Bornelus to prevent him from carrying out that perceived threat. Such a motive is not one that is \u201con account of\u2019 Bornelus\u2019s imputed political opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-9\">Bornelus\u2019s perceived desire for revenge is similar to an asylum applicant\u2019s refusal to cooperate with a guerrilla group, as both are forms of resistance that an asylum applicant, such as Bornelus here, may engage in without any political motivation on the applicant\u2019s part. The Supreme Court and this Court have held that persecution because of resistance to or refusal to cooperate with a guerrilla group alone is insufficient to satisfy the nexus requirement. <em>See Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. at 481-82, 112 S.Ct. at 815-16 (refusal to join guerrilla forces); <em>Rodriguez Morales, </em>488 F.3d at 890-91 (refusal to provide dental services to guerrillas); <em>Rivera v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>487 F.3d 815, 821-22 (11th Cir.2007) (refusal to pay guerrillas\u2019 war tax); <em>Sanchez, </em>392 F.3d at 438 (refusal to meet with and cooperate with guerrillas).</p>\n<p id=\"b855-10\">For example, in <em>Elias-Zacarias, </em>the Supreme Court concluded that being targeted because one resists being recruited by a guerrilla group is not persecution \u201con account of\u2019 political opinion. 502 U.S. at 482, 112 S.Ct. at 816. The Supreme Court rejected the argument that the \u201cmere existence of a generalized \u2018political\u2019 motive underlying the guerrillas\u2019 forced recruitment\u201d established that the persecution was on account of political opinion. <em>Id. </em>The Supreme Court explained that the Immigration and Nationality Act requires the persecution to be on account of the victim\u2019s political opinion, not the persecutor\u2019s political opinion. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b855-11\">The Supreme Court reasoned that \u201c[e]ven a person who supports a guerrilla movement might resist recruitment for a variety of reasons \u2014 fear of combat, a desire to remain with one\u2019s family and friends, a desire to earn a better living in civilian life, to mention only a few.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"830\">*830</page-number>482, 112 S.Ct. at 815-16. Because EliasZacarias had not presented evidence that his resistance was politically motivated or that \u201cthe guerrillas erroneously <em>believed </em>that Elias-Zacarias\u2019 refusal was politically based,\u201d the evidence did not compel a conclusion that the guerrillas would persecute him because of his political opinion. <em>Id. </em>at 482-83, 112 S.Ct. at 816.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-4\">Guided by <em>Elias-Zacarias, </em>we reject Bornelus\u2019s arguments that the act of revenge or vengeance is political expression <em>per se </em>and that the Chimere\u2019s preemptive harassment and death threat necessarily constitute persecution \u201con account of\u2019 political opinion. Even a person who supports the Chimere may seek revenge for a relative\u2019s murder for a variety of reasons, not least of which is the personal desire to punish the murders or to see that justice is done. Bornelus did not present any evidence that the Chimere believe that his perceived desire for revenge is politically based. Bornelus\u2019s arguments to the contrary, there is no evidence in the record that the Chimere imputes a political opinion to anyone who seeks revenge or that they imputed a political opinion to Bornelus in particular based on his perceived desire for revenge for his brother\u2019s murder. <em>See Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. at 482, 112 S.Ct. at 816 (noting that there was no indication in the record that \u201cguerillas erroneously <em>believed </em>that [the asylum applicant\u2019s] refusal was politically based\u201d). The only evidence in the record as to the Chimere\u2019s motive vis-a-vis Bornelus is that the Chimere believe Bornelus will seek revenge. This evidence is insufficient to compel a conclusion that the Chimere have targeted Bornelus on account of an imputed political opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-6\">Absent evidence that the Chimere believed Bornelus\u2019s desire for revenge was political rather than personal, the vendetta upmanship alleged by Bornelus is more consistent with acts of private violence or criminal activity that do not provide the required nexus. <em>See Ruiz v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>440 F.3d 1247, 1258 (11th Cir.2006) (\u201c[E]vidence that either is consistent with acts of private violence or the petitioner\u2019s failure to cooperate with guerillas, or that merely shows that a person has been the victim of criminal activity, does not constitute evidence of persecution based on a statutorily protected ground.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b856-7\">For these reasons, the record does not compel a conclusion that Bornelus has been persecuted or has a well-founded fear of future persecution on account of his political opinion.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b856-8\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b854-8\">. The IJ also concluded that Bornelus was not eligible for CAT relief. Bornelus makes only one passing reference to his claim for CAT relief in his appellate brief to this Court. Therefore, we do not address his CAT claim. <em>See Sepulveda v. U.S. Att'y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1228 n. 2 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b854-9\">. Because the BIA's opinion adopted the IJ's decision as to Bornelus\u2019s failure to show that his fear of persecution was \"on account of\" a protected ground, we review the decisions of both the BIA and the IJ with regard to this issue. <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir.2001). We review legal determinations <em>de novo. Mohammed v. Ashcroft, </em>261 F.3d 1244, 1247-48 (11th Cir.2001). We review factual determinations under the substantial evidence test. <em>Adefemi v. Ashcroft, </em>386 F.3d 1022, 1026-27 (11th Cir.2004) <em>(en </em>banc). Under this highly deferential test, to reverse \u201cwe must find that the record not only supports reversal, but compels it.\u201d <em>Mendoza v. U.S. Att'y Gen., </em>327 F.3d 1283, 1287 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b854-15\">. To establish eligibility for withholding of removal, the applicant must show that it is more likely than not that \"his or her life or freedom would be threatened in the proposed country of removal\u201d on account of a protected ground. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(b); <em>Mendoza v. U.S. Att'y Gen., </em>327 F.3d 1283, 1287 (11th Cir.2003). As with asylum, an applicant for withholding of removal who establishes past persecution is presumed to have a well-founded fear of future persecution and the same burden shifts to the government. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(b)(1).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b856-5\">. Because the record does not compel a finding that Bornelus was persecuted on account of his political opinion, the record also does not compel a finding that Bornelus satisfied the more stringent standard applicable to a claim of withholding of removal. <em>See Zheng v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>451 F.3d 1287, 1292 (11th Cir.2006), <em>cert. denied, </em>-U.S.-, 127 S.Ct. 1124, 166 L.Ed.2d 891 (2007).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
