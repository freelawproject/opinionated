MARTIN, JR., Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b590-15\">Defendant Kentrell O\u2019Daniels pled guilty to possession of more than fifty grams of crack cocaine in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A)(iii). He now appeals his sentence, arguing that it is both procedurally and substantively unreasonable. For the following reasons, we AFFIRM his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-16\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-17\">On August 23, 2005, members of the Straits Area Narcotics Enforcement Team executed a controlled purchase of crack cocaine from a residence in Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan. The next day, another controlled purchase was made from this residence. After this second purchase, the police obtained and executed a search warrant. Inside the residence, detectives found 928 grams of marijuana, 58.6 grams of crack, and 55.2 grams of powder cocaine. Kentrell O\u2019Daniels, the defendant-appellant, and Tredis Lazaell O\u2019Daniels, a co-defendant, lived at the residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-18\">On November 14, 2005, a federal grand jury returned an indictment charging Kentrell O\u2019Daniels with conspiracy to distribute and possession with intent to distribute marijuana, cocaine, and 50 or more grams of crack cocaine. On March 21, 2006, the government'filed a superseding felony information charging O\u2019Daniels with a single count of possession with intent to distribute 50 or more grams of crack. The same day, O\u2019Daniels pled guilty to the charge in the superseding information.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>A Presentence Investigation Report was compiled before O\u2019Daniels\u2019s sentencing. That report lists two prior criminal episodes for which he was convicted and received criminal history points under the guidelines: (1) delivery of cocaine, for which he received 40 to 240 months; and (2) possession of a firearm while committing a felony, carrying a deadly weapon with intent to do great bodily harm less than murder, and assault with intent to do great bodily harm less than murder, for which he received sentences of 24 months, 42 to 90 months, and 42 to 180 months, respectively.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-5\">The Report calculated O\u2019Daniels\u2019s base offense level two ways: (1) for violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(l)(A)(iii) under Sentencing Guideline \u00a7 2Dl.l(c)(4); and (2) as a career offender under Sentencing Guideline \u00a7 4B1.1. Under the first calculation, O\u2019Daniels\u2019s base offense level under \u00a7 2Dl.l(c)(4) was 32 for \u201c[a]t least 50G but less than 150G of Cocaine Base.\u201d The report then recommended a two-level deduction for acceptance of responsibility and a one-level deduction for entering a guilty plea, resulting in a total offense level of 29. However, instead of using this offense level, the report re-calculated O\u2019Daniels\u2019s sentence as a career offender under \u00a7 4B1.1 of the guidelines. Because violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(l)(A)(iii), for which O\u2019Daniels was convicted, carries a maximum penalty of life in prison, under \u00a7 4B1.1 of the guidelines, O\u2019Daniels\u2019s base offense level was 37. Because this number \u201cis greater than the offense level otherwise applicable,\u201d it trumped the initial base level of 32. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Bl.l(b). Applying the three-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility and pleading guilty, the report ultimately recommended a total offense level of 34.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-11\">The report also calculated O\u2019Daniels\u2019s criminal history category. Without taking into account his status as a career offender, O\u2019Daniels\u2019s past convictions resulted in 13 criminal history points, placing him in criminal history category VI. When calculated as a career offender, \u00a7 4B1.1 requires the same criminal history category of VI be used. Thus, under the career offender calculation ultimately recommended by the report, O\u2019Daniels\u2019s total offense level was 34 and his criminal history category was VI, resulting in a guidelines range of 262-327 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-12\">Before his sentencing hearing, O\u2019Daniels filed a sentencing memorandum which asked for a downward variance from the guidelines range recommended in the report. In his memorandum, O\u2019Daniels raised the following arguments for a downward departure: (1) the drug weight was at the low end of the 50 grams to 150 grams range for sentencing; (2) O\u2019Daniels\u2019s good character as evidenced by letters of support from family and friends; (3) the 100:1 ratio between powder cocaine and crack cocaine is irrational and does not meet the purposes of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553;<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>(4) O\u2019Daniels\u2019s motive was strictly financial, and no drug use was supported by his crime; (5) the effective doubling of the recommended sentence due to O\u2019Daniels\u2019s career offender status is inequitable; (6) O\u2019Daniels\u2019s career offender status overstates his personal risk of recidivism; (7) O\u2019Daniels\u2019s incarceration would be costly to taxpayers; (8) O\u2019Daniels\u2019s tragic background and upbringing; (9) O\u2019Daniels\u2019s family responsibility to his child; (10) O\u2019Daniels\u2019s past drug use and need for additional treatment; and (11) O\u2019Daniels\u2019s cooperation with the government.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-4\">At sentencing, the government moved for a two-level downward departure of O\u2019Daniels\u2019s offense level for substantial assistance. The district court granted the motion, resulting in an offense level of 32 with a criminal history category of VI, and a new guidelines range of 210 to 262 months imprisonment. The district court proceeded to sentence O\u2019Daniels to 210 months imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-6\">O\u2019Daniels\u2019s primary argument is that because the district court failed to address his arguments for mitigation during sentencing, his sentence is both procedurally and substantively unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-7\">This Court reviews a district court\u2019s sentencing determination for reasonableness, <em>United States v. Thomas, </em>498 F.3d 336 (6th Cir.2007) (citing <em>Rita v. United States, </em>\u2014U.S.-, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2459, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007)), which, this Court has determined \u201chas both substantive and procedural components,\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>United States v. Jones, </em>489 F.3d 243, 250 (6th Cir.2007)). \u201cThe Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in <em>Rita v. United States </em>reinforces our conclusion that reasonableness review requires us to inquire into both the length of the sentence and the factors evaluated and the procedures employed by the district court in reaching its sentencing determination.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks and citations omitted). After <em>Rita, </em>it is incumbent upon the sentencing judge to \u201csatisfy the procedural requirement of \u2018set[ting] forth enough to satisfy the appellate court that he has considered the parties\u2019 arguments and has a reasoned basis for exercising his own legal decision-making authority.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Lion, </em>491 F.3d 334, 338 (6th Cir.2007) (quoting <em>Rita, </em>127 S.Ct. at 2468). This Court reviews the district court\u2019s decision to \u201censure (1) that the sentencing judge adequately considered the relevant \u00a7 3553(a) factors and clearly stated his reasons for imposing the chosen sentence, and (2) that the sentence is substantively reasonable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 339 (footnote omitted). Although \u201c[t]he amount of reasoning required varies according to context,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 338, \u201cwe will vacate a sentence if the \u2018context and the record\u2019 do not \u2018make clear\u2019 the court\u2019s reasoning,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 339 n. 4 (quoting <em>Rita, </em>127 S.Ct. at 2469).</p>\n<p id=\"b592-11\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-12\">\n<em>1. O\u2019Daniels\u2019s sentence was procedurally reasonable.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b592-13\">O\u2019Daniels argues that the district court\u2019s sentencing determination was procedurally unreasonable because the district court did not adequately set forth reasons for imposing O\u2019Daniels\u2019s sentence. The sentencing transcript makes clear that the district court considered O\u2019Daniels\u2019s status as a career criminal offender and referenced his background, drug use, and inability to get a job. The district court noted that growing up in a \u201ctough, tough circumstance ... is still not an excuse, at least as far as the law is concerned.\u201d The court also noted the need to \u201cget [O\u2019Daniels] away from drugs and to obtain substance abuse treatment at the Bureau of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>Prisons.\u201d Finally, the court stated that while \u201cit is probably difficult coming out of prison to get a job, ... that\u2019s not an excuse as far as the law is concerned.... \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b593-5\">As described above, O\u2019Daniels raised numerous arguments regarding application of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors in his sentencing memorandum, and not all of those arguments were specifically addressed by the district court. However, we do not require district courts to explicitly address every argument made by a defendant for a lower sentence. <em>See United States v. Gale, </em>468 F.3d 929, 940 (6th Cir.2006) (\u201cA sentencing judge has no more duty than we appellate judges to discuss every argument made by a litigant; arguments clearly without merit can, and for the sake of judicial economy should be passed over in silence.\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)). While the district court did not expressly address O\u2019Daniels\u2019s sentencing memorandum, as we wish he would have for a more complete record, we cannot say that the district court did not sufficiently articulate its reasons for O\u2019Daniels\u2019s sentence such that reasonable appellate review is impossible. On the contrary, it appears the district court took into account the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and adequately explained why it chose the sentence it did. <em>See id. </em>(\u201c[W]e will not conclude that a district judge shirked her obligation to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors simply because she did not discuss each one individually or did not expressly parse or address every argument relating to those factors that the defendant advanced.\u201d) (quoting <em>United States v. Fernandez, </em>443 F.3d 19, 30 (2d Cir.2006)).</p>\n<p id=\"b593-6\">\n<em>2. O\u2019Daniels\u2019s sentence was substantively reasonable.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b593-7\">\u201cA sentence may be substantively unreasonable where the district court selects the sentence arbitrarily, bases the sentence on impermissible factors, fails to consider pertinent \u00a7 3553(a) factors or gives an unreasonable amount of weight to any pertinent factor.\u201d <em>United States v. Jones, </em>489 F.3d 243, 252 (6th Cir.2007) (internal quotation marks, citations and alterations omitted). Because O\u2019Daniels was sentenced within the applicable Guidelines range, his sentence is credited with a \u201crebuttable presumption of reasonableness.\u201d <em>Rita, </em>127 S.Ct. at 2462; <em>see also United States v. Williams, </em>436 F.3d 706, 708 (6th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b593-9\">O\u2019Daniels argues that his 210-month sentence is substantively unreasonable because it does not fulfill the purposes of sentencing as outlined in the Sentencing Reform Act and \u00a7 3553(a)(2). According to O\u2019Daniels, the disparity in sentencing for crack cocaine offenses as compared to powder cocaine offenses is unconstitutional and flies in the face of the purposes of sentencing. However, because of O\u2019Daniels\u2019s status as a career offender, the 100:1 crack cocaine ratio did not affect his sentence. If O\u2019Daniels had not been sentenced as a career offender, the 100:1 crack cocaine ratio would be before us. But here, where the ratio played no role under the guidelines in Ms sentence, it does not appear that his argument holds water.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-10\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-11\">For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM O\u2019Daniels\u2019s sentence as both procedurally and substantively reasonable.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b591-6\">. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553.
