The district court\u2019s granted summary judgment against Elston holding that her action was barred by judicial estoppel because she had failed to list her claim in her bankruptcy proceeding. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-20\">We review the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment de novo, and will affirm if, viewing the \u201cevidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, there are no genuine issues of material fact and the district court applied the relevant substantive law.\u201d <em>Hamilton v. State Farm Fire and Cas. Co., </em>270 F.3d 778, 782 (9th Cir.2001). However, we review \u201cthe district court\u2019s application of judicial estoppel to the facts of [a] case for an abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b725-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>In <em>Hamilton, </em>we explained that \u201c[j]udicial estoppel is an equitable doctrine that precludes a party from gaining an advantage by asserting one position, and then later seeking an advantage by taking a clearly inconsistent position.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We further explained that we invoke judicial estoppel not only to prevent a party from gaining an advantage by taking inconsistent position, but because of general considerations of the orderly administration of justice and regard for the dignity of the judicial process. <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Russell v. Rolfs, </em>893 F.2d 1033, 1037 (9th Cir.1990)). Taking our lead from the Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in <em>New Hampshire v. Maine, </em>532 U.S. 742, 121 S.Ct. 1808, 149 L.Ed.2d 968 (2001), we considered three factors: (1) whether the party\u2019s later position is clearly inconsistent with its earlier position; (2) whether the party had succeeded in persuading a court to accept its earlier position; and (3) \u201cwhether the party seeking to assert an inconsistent position would derive an unfair advantage or impose an unfair detriment on the opposing party if not estopped.\u201d <em>Hamilton, </em>at 782-83.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-5\">We have also held that the inquiry is whether \u201cthe debtor ha[d] knowledge of enough facts to know that a potential cause of action exists during the pendency of the bankruptcy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 784. <em>See also Hay v. First Interstate Bank of Kalispell, N.A., </em>978 F.2d 555, 557 (9th Cir.1992) (\u201cWe recognize that <em>all </em>facts were not known to Desert Mountain at that time, but enough was known to require notification of the existence of the asset to the bankruptcy court.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b725-6\">Elston contends that she actually informed the trustee and bankruptcy judge of the claims.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> She claims to have stated in her filings that her bankruptcy was caused \u201csolely as a result of a severe back injury and result of permanent disability sustained on the debtor\u2019s last job.\u201d She also alleges that she sent a letter to the bankruptcy trustee indicating that she was \u201cstill awaiting rehabilitate medical care under my workers compensation claim.\u201d Even accepting these allegations as true for the purposes of evaluating the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment, these disclosures were insufficient to disclose to the trustee and creditors that she was asserting a bad faith insurance tort claim and had received a settlement offer prior to bankruptcy. Thus, even assuming \u2014 as Elston contends \u2014 that she did not intend to mislead the bankruptcy court, this does not raise a genuine issue of fact. The district court\u2019s determination that Elston had sufficient knowledge of her claims to be required under <em>Hamilton </em>and <em>Hay </em>to list her claims in her bankruptcy proceeding is factually and legally sound. Furthermore, there is no doubt that (1) Elston\u2019s position in this litigation is inconsistent with her earlier position, (2) the Bankruptcy Court adopted Elston\u2019s earlier position when it granted her a discharge, and (3) as noted by the district court, Elston would derive an unfaii\u2019 advantage if allowed \u201cthe Chapter 7 discharge of her debts and whatever judgment or settlement would come from the instant action.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b725-10\">For the foregoing reasons, the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment against Elston on the basis that her claims are barred by judicial estoppel is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b724-21\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
