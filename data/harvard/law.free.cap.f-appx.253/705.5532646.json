Shadur, Senior United States District Judge for the Northern District of Illinois, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b732-11\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>***</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b732-12\">Plaintiff Tod Thelen appeals the district court\u2019s affirmance of the decision of the Administrative Law Judge\u2019s (\u201cALJ\u201d) denial of Social Security Disability Benefits and Supplemental Income. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we vacate and remand for reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-16\">We review de novo the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment. <em>Burch v. Barnhart, </em>400 F.3d 676, 679 (9th Cir.2005). The denial of benefits by the ALJ may be set aside only if it is based on legal error or is not supported by substantial evidence. <em>Id. </em>Absent affirmative evidence of malingering, an ALJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding must be supported by clear and convincing reasons. <em>Vertigan v. Halter, </em>260 F.3d 1044, 1049 (9th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b732-17\">In discrediting Thelen\u2019s testimony, the ALJ repeatedly emphasized that Thelen \u201ccoaches children\u2019s baseball.\u201d Although Thelen himself used the word coaching, the transcript of his testimony makes it clear that his only involvement as a coach was to count pitches. There is no evidence in the record that Thelen did anything more than that. The label in the ALJ\u2019s decision of this passive and sedentary activity as \u201ccoaching\u201d without any further qualification materially overstates the record and creates a misleading impression of Thelen\u2019s capacity. Any person who read the words \u201ccoaches children\u2019s baseball\u201d would have an impression of Thelen\u2019s activity far different from the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-18\">Second, and more importantly, the ALJ did not have all parts of the record before him. Specifically, a letter from a treating psychologist, Dr. Levinson, was not before the ALJ. The letter explains that Levinson had performed a series of tests on Thelen, including the Beck Depression Inventory, the McGill Pain Questionnaire, the Multi-Dimensional Pain Inventory, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>and the Minnesota Multiphase Personality Inventory. The letter went on to summarize the results of the tests performed, and stated \u201c[i]n general, this profile suggests that this patient is very psychologically distressed.\u201d The letter was in the Appeals Council\u2019s exhibits and stamped \u201creceived June 29, 2001.\u201d A notation on the letter reads: \u201cThese two reports were received by the H.O. but were not entered into the record. They were found at the bottom of the claim file.\u201d Although the Appeals Council did not find that the missing letter could have changed the outcome with regard to whether Thelen\u2019s depression constituted an impairment, the Appeals Council did not consider whether the letter might have bolstered Thelen\u2019s credibility in the ALJ\u2019s eyes.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-5\">VACATED and REMANDED to the district court for REMAND to the Social Security Administration for reconsideration.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b732-19\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
