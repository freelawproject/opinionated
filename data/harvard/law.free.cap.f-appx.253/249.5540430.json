Our review of the district court docket sheet reveals that the district court denied the motion in April 2007. Accordingly, because the district court has already acted on Knight\u2019s motion, we deny the mandamus petition as moot. We grant Knight\u2019s motion to proceed in forma pauperis. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-21\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b275-17\"> Although Knight characterizes his district court pleading as a motion for release from illegal imprisonment, our review of the district court docket sheet reveals that the only motion filed by Knight in October 2007 was a motion for return of property and that there is no motion for release pending in the district court.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
