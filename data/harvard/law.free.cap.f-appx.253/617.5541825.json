His counsel has moved to withdraw and filed a brief under <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), arguing that the sentences, at the top of the advisory Guidelines range, are unreasonable, because the court gave undue weight to a robbery victim\u2019s testimony as compared to Williamson\u2019s mental illness and sentenced him beyond what was minimally sufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-24\">The presumption of reasonableness accorded a sentence within the Guidelines range, <em>see Rita v. United States, </em>\u2014U.S.-, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2462-68, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007), may be rebutted by showing that the district court failed to consider a factor that should have received significant weight, gave significant weight to an irrelevant factor, or otherwise committed a clear error of judgment, <em>see United States v. Davidson, </em>437 F.3d 737, 741 (8th Cir.2006). The record supports that the district court properly considered only relevant factors, including the offense circumstances and Williamson\u2019s extensive criminal history, as well as his serious mental illness; and that the court did not commit a clear error of judgment in choosing sentences at the top of the Guidelines range. Thus, we conclude that the sentences are not unreasonable. <em>See United States v. Haack, </em>403 F.3d 997, 1003 (8th Cir.2005) (standard of review).</p>\n<p id=\"b643-27\">Having reviewed the record under <em>Penson v. Ohio, </em>488 U.S. 75, 80, 109 S.Ct. 346, 102 L.Ed.2d 300 (1988), we find no nonfrivolous issues. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment and we grant counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw on condition <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>that counsel inform appellant about the procedures for filing petitions for rehearing and for certiorari.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b643-22\">.
