We deny the petition on both grounds that Mboussi-Ona presents.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-23\">Mboussi-Ona argues that the IJ committed a host of due process errors. <em>See, e.g., Agyeman v. INS, </em>296 F.3d 871, 876-77 (9th Cir.2002); <em>Campos-Sanchez v. INS, </em>164 F.3d 448, 450 (9th Cir.1999). Mboussi-Ona claims that the IJ failed to act as a neutral factfinder and failed to assist him as a pro se litigant by not ensuring that he understood the relief available or the evidence needed to prove his claims, and by not helping him develop the record. None of these arguments is convincing. The IJ adequately informed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>Mboussi-Ona of his rights and the options for relief he could pursue and helped him develop the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-4\">Mboussi-Ona also argues that because his two convictions in 1997 for grand theft under Cal.Penal Code \u00a7\u00a7 484 and 487.1 (currently \u00a7 487(a)) were expunged under Cal.Penal Code \u00a7 1203.4 they do not constitute \u201cconvictions\u201d for the purposes of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2); <em>see also </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(48)(A) (defining \u201cconviction\u201d). But our precedent forecloses this argument. <em>See Ramirez-Castro v. INS, </em>287 F.3d 1172, 1174-75 (9th Cir.2002) (noting that, \u201cas a general rule, an expunged conviction qualifies as a conviction under the INA,\u201d and holding that, even \u201cassuming that some state expungement statutes could eliminate completely the immigration consequences of a state conviction, California Penal Code section 1203.4 is not such a statute\u201d); <em>Murillo-Espinoza v. INS, </em>261 F.3d 771, 774 (9th Cir.2001) (similar). Even if other exceptions exist beyond the one carved out for the Federal First Offender Act, <em>see Lujan-Armendariz v. INS, </em>222 F.3d 728 (9th Cir.2000), and <em>Dillingham v. INS, </em>267 F.3d 996 (9th Cir.2001), the present case does not demand such an exception. <em>Cf. Ramirez-Castro, </em>287 F.3d at 1174 (\u201cPetitioner must demonstrate that his case falls within the exception created by <em>Lujan-Armendariz, </em>or show that some other, yet unrecognized, exception applies.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b694-5\">Petition DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b693-24\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
