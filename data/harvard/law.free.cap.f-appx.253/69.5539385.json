He was sentenced principally to a term of 324 months\u2019 imprisonment and three years\u2019 supervised release. We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-20\">Reviewing the district court\u2019s decision for unreasonableness, <em>see United </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number><em>States v. Fernandez, </em>443 F.3d 19, 26 (2d Cir.2006) (citing <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 261-62, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005)), without presuming that it is so, <em>cf. Rita v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2462, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007), we find no merit to Smith\u2019s claim that the district court imposed a procedurally unreasonable sentence when, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1, it converted $4,500 in cash seized from Smith\u2019s bedroom wastepaper basket to an equivalent drug amount of 45 grams of cocaine base. As an initial matter, at Smith\u2019s sentencing hearing, the district court adopted the findings of the probation officer\u2019s presentence investigation report (\u201cPSR\u201d), which reasonably concluded that the amount of cocaine that \u201caccurately reflect[ed] the scale of this offense\u201d included both the seized cocaine base and the 45 grams converted from the seized currency. Thus, we need not address Smith\u2019s contention that the sentencing court, in all instances, must make a specific finding that \u201cthe amount seized does not reflect the scale of the offense,\u201d <em>see </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1, cmt. n. 12 (2004), before converting currency to its equivalent weight in drug quantity. <em>See United States v. Prince, </em>110 F.3d 921, 924 (2d Cir.1997) (\u201cA district court satisfies its obligation to make findings sufficient to permit appellate review ... if the court indicates, either at the sentencing hearing or in the written judgment, that it is adopting the recommendations in the PSR.\u201d (alteration in original) (internal citation omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b97-7\">Further, we reject Smith\u2019s claim that the district court erred when it determined his quantity of drugs for sentencing purposes. Smith\u2019s reliance on <em>United States v. Shonubi, </em>103 F.3d 1085, 1089 (2d Cir.1997), is unavailing. The \u201cspecific evidence\u201d standard set forth in <em>Shonubi </em>requires \u201cevidence that points specifically to a drug quantity for which the defendant is responsible,\u201d in order to calculate a defendant\u2019s base level offense. 103 F.3d at 1089-90. Here, officers observed Smith selling cocaine base and seized $4,500 in cash, bundled in rubber bands by denomination, from a bedroom wastebasket that also contained hundreds of individually packaged bags of cocaine base, a small scale, and a loaded revolver. Smith admitted in a signed statement that he kept his gun and drugs in the wastebasket, which he knew also contained $5,000 in cash. In light of the evidence particular to Smith\u2019s drug possession, including Smith\u2019s own admissions, we find that the district court\u2019s calculation of the drag quantity was not clearly erroneous. <em>See Prince, </em>110 F.3d at 924. Accordingly, we find no procedural error in the district court\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-9\">Finally, we reject Smith\u2019s claim that the district court erred by considering acquitted conduct to enhance his sentence. Smith concedes that this argument is foreclosed by our decision in <em>United States v. Vaughn, </em>430 F.3d 518, 526-27 (2d Cir.2005), ce<em>rt. denied sub nom. Lindo v. United States, </em>547 U.S. 1060, 126 S.Ct. 1665, 164 L.Ed.2d 405 (2006), but we acknowledge that Smith raises this challenge to preserve it.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-10\">UPON DUE CONSIDERATION, it is hereby ORDERED, ADJUDGED AND DECREED that the judgment of conviction is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
