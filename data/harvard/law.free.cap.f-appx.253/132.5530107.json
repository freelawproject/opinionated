He was sentenced principally to 24 months\u2019 and 19 days\u2019 imprisonment, followed by three years\u2019 supervised released. We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-9\">Abreu-Vasquez challenges the reasonableness of his sentence on the grounds that the availability of lower sentences through \u201cfast-track\u201d programs in some, but not all, districts creates unwarranted sentencing disparities within the meaning of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(6). We rejected this argument in <em>United States v. Mejia, </em>461 F.3d 158 (2d Cir.2006), and therefore find that the district court did not err in refusing to reduce Abreu-Vasquez\u2019s sentence based on the alleged disparities created by fast-track programs. <em>See id. </em>at 164.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-10\">We also reject Abreu-Vasquez\u2019s contention that the district court committed procedural error by not considering all of the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors. The record reflects that the court treated the Guidelines as advisory and considered the defendant\u2019s background, in addition to reviewing the arguments raised by AbreuVasquez in support of a downward departure or non-Guidelines sentence. Aceordingly, we find no unreasonableness here, <em>See United States v. Fernandez, </em>443 F.3d 19, 26 (2d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b159-11\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
