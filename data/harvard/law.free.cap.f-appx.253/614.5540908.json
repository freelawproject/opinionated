Gurrola argues that his sentence is unlawful because it is contrary to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(6) and the directions of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). The government urges that the appeal waiver in Gurrola\u2019s plea agreement calls for dismissal of the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>We will enforce an appeal waiver where both the plea agreement and the appeal waiver were entered into knowingly and voluntarily, the appeal falls within the scope of the waiver, and no miscarriage of justice would result. <em>See United States v. Andis, </em>333 F.3d 886, 889-92 (8th Cir.2003) (en banc). We conclude that Gurrola knowingly and voluntarily entered into his plea agreement and appeal waive. The appeal falls within the scope of the broad appeal waiver, which provided that Gurrola waived all rights to appeal his sentence unless it exceeded 188 months. <em>Cf. United States v. Reeves </em>410 F.3d 1031, 1034-35 (8th Cir.2005) (broad appeal waiver includes issues arising from <em>Booker). </em>And enforcing the waiver would not result in a miscarriage of justice. <em>See Andis, </em>333 F.3d at 891-92 (sentence within statutory range is not illegal sentence). We therefore enforce the appeal waiver and dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b640-28\">. The Honorable Joan N.
