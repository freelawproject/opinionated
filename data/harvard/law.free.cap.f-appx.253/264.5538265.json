Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-15\">Gross first contends the court erred by punishing him for a drug quantity greater than that found by the jury or admitted by him. Count Three of the superseding indictment alleged distribution of one kilogram or more of heroin and five kilograms or more of cocaine. The district court found by a preponderance of the evidence, after considering the advisory nature of the guidelines, a quantity of three to ten kilograms of heroin.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-16\">As alleged in the superseding indictment, Gross faced a maximum possible sentence of life imprisonment. 21 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A) (West 2000 &amp; Supp.2007). Following <em>Booker, </em>the federal sentencing guidelines are now advisory. However, when calculating guideline ranges, sentencing courts may still make factual determinations regarding sentencing enhancement by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>United States v. Morris, </em>429 F.3d 65, 72 (4th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b291-17\">As the indictment alleged Gross was responsible for one kilogram or more of heroin, and as the district court\u2019s finding of three to ten kilograms did not increase Gross\u2019 sentence beyond the prescribed statutory maximum, Gross\u2019 first challenge to the district court\u2019s findings of fact is without merit. <em>See Booker, </em>543 U.S. at 244, 125 S.Ct. 738; <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 490, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000); <em>United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540, 546 (4th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b291-18\">Gross next attacks the district court\u2019s finding that he possessed a firearm during <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>the commission of a drug offense. Gross asserts that no evidence was presented that he possessed a firearm. Also, Gross did not admit to possession of a firearm, and he was not found guilty beyond a reasonable doubt by the jury of possession of a firearm. Accordingly, Gross asserts that the district court erred in enhancing his sentence two levels under <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l) (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b292-4\">Section 2Dl.l(b)(l) provides for a two level increase to a defendant\u2019s base offense level if the defendant possessed a dangerous weapon during a drug offense. A \u00a7 2D1.1 enhancement is to be applied unless it is clearly improbable that the weapon was connected with the offense. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1, cmt. n. 3. \u201cIt is well established that even where no conspiracy is charged, enhancement is appropriate where a firearm is physically possessed by another participant in the offense conduct to further the illegal enterprise.\u201d <em>United States v. Falesbork, </em>5 F.3d 715, 720 (4th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">Because there was overwhelming evidence that Gross\u2019 co-conspirators possessed weapons during and in furtherance of the course of the criminal conduct for which Gross was convicted and as this possession was reasonably foreseeable by Gross, the court did not err in enhancing Gross\u2019 sentence under \u00a7 2D1.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">Gross raises a third challenge to the district court\u2019s calculation of his advisory guidelines range. Based on Gross\u2019 three prior convictions, the district court determined Gross to be a career offender. According to Gross, one of those three convictions was a 2001 conviction for distribution of heroin. Gross argues that this conviction cannot be used to enhance his guidelines range because the heroin distribution was a specific predicate act used to convict him of RICO violations under Count One. This court rejected the argument Gross makes now in Gross\u2019 and co-defendant Ronald Eddie\u2019s prior appeal. <em>United States v. Gross, </em>199 Fed.Appx. 219, 244 (4th Cir.2006) (unpublished). Accordingly, Gross\u2019 third alleged error is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-8\">Gross\u2019 final argument on appeal is that his sentence was unreasonable. Gross argues that his sentence of 600 months was unreasonable as it was, due to his age, a de facto life sentence. Also, Gross argues that the district court imposed a variance sentence and failed to adequately explain the reasons for the variance.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-9\">Following <em>Booker, </em>a sentencing court must engage in a multi-step process at sentencing. After calculating the correct guidelines range, the sentencing court must consider the guidelines range, any relevant factors set forth in the guidelines, and the factors in 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(a) (West 2000 <em>&amp; </em>Supp.2007); then the court may impose sentence. <em>United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540, 546 (4th Cir.2005). Considering the factors in \u00a7 3553(a) does not require \u201cdiscussion of each factor in a checklist fashion.\u201d <em>United States v. Moreland, </em>437 F.3d 424, 433 (4th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b292-10\">On appeal, this court reviews a sentence to determine whether it is reasonable. <em>Moreland, </em>437 F.3d at 433. A <em>post-Booker </em>sentence may be unreasonable for procedural or substantive reasons. However, a sentence that falls within a properly calculated advisory guidelines range is presumed to be reasonable. <em>Rita v. United States, </em>\u2014U.S.-, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2462, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b292-13\">Gross\u2019 sentence was procedurally reasonable. In imposing sentence, the district court recognized the advisory nature of the guidelines and discussed the applicability of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors to Gross\u2019 case. The district court specifically noted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>that: (1) the nature and circumstances of the offense evidence a total disrespect for the law; (2) a severe sentence was necessary to reflect the seriousness of the offense and to promote respect for the law; (3) a severe sentence was necessary to deter others; and (4) a severe sentence was necessary to protect the public from Gross. The court then sentenced Gross to 600 months\u2019 imprisonment, which fell within Gross\u2019 advisory guidelines range.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">Gross\u2019 sentence was also substantively reasonable. Gross was the leader of a large drug conspiracy and was responsible for a number of criminal acts, including distributing five or more kilograms of cocaine and three to ten kilograms of heroin. Additionally, Gross had a significant criminal history that included the rape of a twelve year old, which occurred while he was on supervised release for a prior drug offense. As Gross\u2019 sentence fell within his properly determined guidelines range, Gross\u2019 sentence is presumed to be reasonable. Gross has failed to rebut the presumption of reasonableness.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">We affirm the judgment of the district court. We dispense with oral argument as the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-7\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b293-9\"> Gross' 600-month sentence fell in his guidelines range of 360 months to life, so this was not a variance sentence.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
