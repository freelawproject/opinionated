NORRIS, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b580-6\">Defendant Daniel Lee LaCasse challenges the sentence imposed after he pleaded guilty to being a felon in possession of a firearm. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g). He contends that the district court erred when it enhanced his sentence under the Aimed Career Criminal Act (\u201cACCA\u201d), 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e), based upon three prior convictions for either drug offenses or violent felonies. He argues that the definition of \u201cviolent felony\u201d renders the ACCA void for vagueness or, in the alternative, that his prior conviction under Michigan\u2019s \u201cfleeing and eluding\u201d statute, Mich. Comp. Laws, \u00a7 750.479a, does not qualify as a violent felony.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-8\">This prosecution was triggered when defendant\u2019s girlfriend, while intoxicated, crashed the car in which the couple was driving. Officers of the Menominee County Sheriffs Department responded and defendant asked officers for a ride home from the scene. Although they indicated that he would be subject to a search for weapons, he consented. The search uncovered a Bryco Arms, .380 caliber pistol. Defendant was arrested at the scene for carrying a concealed weapon, being a felon in possession of a firearm, possessing of a firearm while intoxicated, and carrying open intoxicants while in a motor vehicle. The county prosecutor\u2019s office referred this case to federal authorities, resulting in a single-count indictment for being a felon in possession of a firearm. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b580-9\">Defendant entered into a plea agreement with the government. The agreement left open the possibility that defendant could be subject to the enhanced penalties of the ACCA, which provides for a minimum sentence of fifteen years of incarceration for felons who have three previous convictions for a \u201cviolent felony or a serious drug offense.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(1). Among other things, \u201cviolent felony\u201d means a crime that is \u201cburglary, arson, or extortion, involves the use of explosives, or <em>otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\u201d </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(ii) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b580-11\">With respect to defendant\u2019s prior fleeing and eluding conviction, the agreement reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-12\">In 2001, the Defendant was convicted in the 41st Circuit Court, Menominee County, Michigan, of fleeing and eluding a police officer in the 3rd degree, in violation of Mich. Comp. L. \u00a7 750.479a(3), with a sentencing enhancement for being a habitual offender, in violation of Mich. Comp. L. \u00a7 769.11(l)(a). The Defendant received a sentence of 3 to 10 years for this offense. This offense is punishable by up to 10 years in prison and qualifies as a \u201ccrime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year,\u201d as that phrase is defined in Title 18, United States Code, Section 921(a)(20).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b580-13\">Prior to sentencing, defense counsel filed a memorandum arguing that the fleeing and eluding conviction does not constitute a crime of violence for purposes of the ACCA. Counsel repeated her position at the sentencing hearing and also contended that the definition of \u201cviolent felony\u201d was void for vagueness. The district court rejected both of these positions before sentencing defendant to 188 months of imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>ii.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-5\">This court reviews <em>de novo </em>the legal question of whether a prior conviction constitutes a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under the ACCA. <em>United States v. Martin, 378 </em>F.3d 578, 580 (6th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b581-6\">In two decisions, we have considei\u2019ed whether Michigan\u2019s fleeing and eluding statute represents a crime of violence for purposes of the analogous career offender enhancement of the Sentencing Guidelines, U.S.S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 4B1.1, 4B1.2, which uses the same \u201cserious potential risk of physical injury\u201d language as the ACCA. In <em>Martin </em>this court concluded that a third-degree fleeing and eluding conviction constitutes a crime of violence because the additional factors required to raise the offense to third-degree from fourth-degree \u2014 to wit, if the violation results in a collision or accident, or if a portion of the violation occurred in a 35 miles-per-hour or less speed zone \u2014 satisfy the requirement that the offense presents a \u201cserious potential risk of physical injury.\u201d 378 F.3d at 583-84.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-7\">We subsequently limited <em>Martin </em>to cases involving third-degree fleeing and eluding convictions, however. <em>United States v. Foreman, </em>436 F.3d 638 (6th Cir.2006). In setting the stage for its discussion, <em>Foreman </em>provides the following thumbnail sketch of the appropriate approach:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-8\">The Supreme Court has provided some guidance as to how to determine whether an offense may be considered a crime of violence. In <em>Taylor v. United States, </em>495 U.S. 575, 110 S.Ct. 2143, 109 L.Ed.2d 607 (1990), the Court addressed \u2022what evidence a trial court may consider in answering the question. The Court concluded that we must take a categorical approach and first consider the statutory definition of the offense. <em>Id. </em>A categorical approach requires this Court to look at \u201cthe fact of the conviction and the statutory definition of the predicate offense\u201d but not the \u201cunderlying facts regarding the offense.\u201d <em>United States v. Martin, </em>378 F.3d 578, 581 (6th Cir.2004) (quoting <em>United States v. Arnold, </em>58 F.3d 1117, 1121 (6th Cir.1995)). This approach \u201cavoids subsequent evidentiary enquiries into the factual basis for the earlier conviction,\u201d preventing the defendant from having to re-defend previous conduct which may not have been found true by the previous jury. <em>Shepard v. United States, </em>544 U.S. 13, 125 S.Ct. 1254, 1259, 161 L.Ed.2d 205 (2005).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-10\">However, should this initial inquiry under the categorical approach fail to be determinative, a court may consider \u201cthe statutory definition, charging document, written plea agreement, transcript of plea colloquy, and any explicit factual finding by the trial judge to which the defendant assented\u201d in determining whether the crime was a crime of violence. <em>Id. </em>at 1257. Although both <em>Shepard </em>and <em>Taylor </em>addressed whether burglary could be considered a violent felony under the Armed Career Criminal Act, the application of these rules to the definition of \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under the Sentencing Guidelines has become an accepted practice in this Circuit. <em>See United States v. Arnold, </em>58 F.3d 1117, 1121-22 (6th Cir.1995).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b581-11\"><em>Id. </em>at 640-41 (citation omitted). Ultimately, Foreman held that \u201cthe categorical approach is not determinative of whether fourth degree fleeing and eluding is a \u2018crime of violence,\u2019 \u201d and thus remanded to allow the district court to consider the sources approved by <em>Shepard. Id. </em>at 643.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-12\">While the district court in this case discussed the underlying facts of the case during the sentencing hearing, it ultimately made clear that it based its holding on the categorical approach taken by this court in <em>MaHin. </em>The following exchange <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>between the court and the assistant United States attorney (\u201cAUSA\u201d) resolves any ambiguity with respect to this point:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b582-4\">AUSA: [I]t\u2019s the government\u2019s position in this case that, based on <em>Martin, ... </em>this fleeing and eluding third, whether it\u2019s involving an accident or in an area with a speed limit less than 35 miles an hour, just as a general matter, would qualify as a violent felony under the 924(e), regardless of the facts of the case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b582-5\">THE COURT: Yes. And I agree with you, and ... that\u2019s what I have held, and that\u2019s what I do hold, if I haven\u2019t said so. I just made the observation that the facts are pretty egregious in this case, but I\u2019m not basing my decision on that.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b582-6\">Defense counsel takes the position that, because the fleeing and eluding statute can be violated without giving rise to any serious potential risk of physical harm to another, it cannot be categorically considered a crime of violence. She recognizes, of course, that <em>Martin </em>held to the contrary and asks us to distinguish that case because it was decided based upon the Sentencing Guidelines\u2019 career offender enhancement, not the ACCA. The <em>Martin </em>panel recognized that defendant had some potential relief under the Guidelines, which counsel contends makes a difference:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b582-7\">Had the district court believed that the calculation of Martin\u2019s criminal history category under the Guidelines resulted in an inequitable sentence, \u00a7 4A1.3 would have permitted a downward adjustment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b582-8\"><em>Martin, </em>378 F.3d at 584. The ACCA contains no such provision, which means that any judicial \u201cfact finding\u201d with respect to the nature of prior convictions assumes heightened importance and should be discouraged. The possibility of a downward departure under the Sentencing Guidelines does not mean that interpretations of what constitutes a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under the Sentencing Guidelines may not be followed in construing whether a crime is a \u201cviolent felony\u201d under the ACCA. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Sawyers, </em>409 F.3d 732, 740 n. 9 (6th Cir.2005) (using Guidelines to interpret ACCA); <em>United States v. Taylor, </em>489 F.3d 1112, 1113 (11th Cir.2007) (\u201cWe have also held that our cases interpreting \u2018crime of violence\u2019 under \u00a7 4B1.2 provide important guidance in determining what is a \u2018violent felony\u2019 under the ACCA \u2018because the definition for both terms are virtually identical.\u2019 \u201d (citation omitted)); <em>United States v. Ladwig, </em>432 F.3d 1001, 1005 n. 9 (9th Cir.2005) (noting that the court can consult cases construing \u00a7 4B1.2 of the Sentencing Guidelines when considering whether a crime is a violent felony under the ACCA because the definition of \u201cviolent felony\u201d under the ACCA is identical to the definition of \u2018crime of violence\u2019 under the Sentencing Guidelines); <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>417 F.3d 990, 996-97 (8th Cir.2005) (\u201cThe statutory definition of \u2018violent felony\u2019 is viewed as interchangeable with the guidelines definition of \u2018crime of violence.\u2019 Therefore, in determining whether a defendant qualifies as an armed career criminal under the ACCA, we are bound by case law defining a crime of violence under \u00a7 4B1.2.\u201d (internal citations omitted)). In our view, the district court\u2019s conclusion that Michigan\u2019s third-degree fleeing and eluding conviction constituted a crime of violence under the ACCA is fully consistent with <em>Shepard </em>and <em>Martin </em>and we affirm on that basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-10\">Defendant also contends that the provision of the ACCA which defines a violent felony as one that \u201cinvolves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another\u201d is void for vagueness. The Supreme Court recently held that attempted burglary qualified as a \u201cvi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>olent felony\u201d under the ACCA\u2019s residual provision for crimes that present \u201cserious potential risk of physical injury to another.\u201d <em>James v. United States, </em>-U.S.-, 127 S.Ct. 1586, 1590, 167 L.Ed.2d 532 (2007). In dissent, Justice Scalia took the position that the residual provision must either be interpreted coherently \u201cso that it applies in a relatively predictable and administrable fashion to a smaller subset of crimes\u201d or be deemed void for vagueness. <em>Id. </em>at 1609. The majority addresses the vagueness contention, albeit in a footnote, before rejecting it. <em>Id. </em>at 1598 n. 6. Although not contested in that case, we are unwilling to find the provision void for vagueness when the Supreme Court so recently declined an invitation to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-8\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
