He argues that his positive test for marijuana and prior convictions for drug-related offenses did not give the parole officer reasonable cause to conduct the search. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-24\">A parolee\u2019s reasonable expectation of privacy under the Fourth Amendment is defined by the conditions of his parole. <em>See Samson v. California, </em>547 U.S. 843, 126 S.Ct. 2193, 2199, 165 L.Ed.2d 250 (2006). As a Nevada parolee, Rasberry was prohibited from possessing narcotics and was subject to search \u201cupon reasonable cause as ascertained by [his] Parole Officer.\u201d Reasonable cause, as defined by Nevada courts, includes \u201creasonable grounds to believe a violation of a parole agreement has occurred.\u201d <em>Allan v. State, </em>103 Nev. 512, 746 P.2d 138, 140 (1987). Because Rasberry\u2019s positive drug screen for marijuana gave his parole officer a reasonable belief that he had violated the narcotics condition of his parole, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>search of Rasberry\u2019s apartment violated no reasonable expectation of privacy.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b673-17\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
