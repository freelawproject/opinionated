We have reviewed the record and find no reversible error. Accordingly, we affirm for the reasons stated by the district court. <em>Reed v. Lafoon, </em>No. 1:07-cv-00186-CMH (E.D. Va. filed Mar. 28, 2007 &amp; entered Apr. 2, 2007). We deny Reed\u2019s motion to submit new evidence and dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-7\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
