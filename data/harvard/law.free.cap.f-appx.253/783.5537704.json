TYMKOVICH, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b811-20\">Abel Torres, proceeding pro se, seeks a certificate of appealability (COA) to enable him to appeal the district court\u2019s denial of the habeas petition he filed pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1)(A) (providing an appeal may not be taken from the denial of a \u00a7 2254 habeas petition unless the petitioner first obtains a COA). Torres also seeks an evidentiary hearing and leave to proceed in forma pauperis. For substantially the same reasons provided by the district court, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"786\">*786</page-number>I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b812-4\">Torres was tried for killing his 21-month old daughter. A Kansas state jury convicted him of felony murder in the first degree based on the underlying crime of felony abuse of a child. Torres is serving a sentence of life in prison with no possibility of parole for twenty years. The Kansas Supreme Court affirmed his conviction on direct appeal. Torres filed this \u00a7 2254 action in the United States District Court for the District of Kansas, and the court denied his petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-5\">II. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b812-6\">In order to obtain a COA, Torres must make \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2). In order to do so, Torres \u201cmust show that reasonable jurists could debate whether ... the petition should have been resolved in a different manner or that the issues presented were adequate to deserve encouragement to proceed further.\u201d <em>Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 336, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003) (internal quotation marks omitted). \u201c[A] claim can be debatable even though every jurist of reason might agree, after the COA has been granted and the case has received full consideration, that [the] petitioner will not prevail.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 338, 123 S.Ct. 1029.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-7\">In his \u00a7 2254 petition, Torres raises several grounds for relief. The district court concluded he procedurally defaulted on the following two claims: (1) the trial court violated his Sixth Amendment rights when it admitted gruesome autopsy photographs \u2014 other than state\u2019s Exhibits 22 and 31 \u2014 into evidence; and (2) the trial court erred in allowing the state to introduce testimony of six expert witnesses on shaken baby syndrome.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-8\">The district court then reviewed and rejected the following eleven grounds for relief: (1) the record contained insufficient evidence of felony murder; (2) the trial court violated his Sixth Amendment right to confront witnesses when it admitted evidence of his statements to law enforcement officials; (3) the state violated his right to due process because it did not record his two interviews with law enforcement officers, and the trial court erred when it did not instruct the jury it could make an inference against the state based on its failure to record the interviews; (4) the trial court violated his <em>Miranda </em>rights by admitting evidence of statements he made to law enforcement officials; (5) the trial court erred in not instructing the jury on the lesser included offenses of reckless second degree murder and reckless involuntary manslaughter; (6) the tidal court erred in admitting state\u2019s Exhibits 22 and 31 into evidence; (7) the trial court erred in denying a motion for mistrial based on allegations that the prosecutor tampered with a witness; (8) the trial court erred in allowing demonstrative illustrations of \u201cshaken impact\u201d and \u201cshaken baby\u201d syndrome; (9) the trial court erred in allowing Dr. Katherine Melhorn\u2019s testimony; (10) the trial court erred in allowing certain testimony of expert witness Dr. Mary Dudley; and (11) the cumulative effect of trial errors deprived Torres of his right to a fair trial-.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-10\">For substantially the same reasons as those set forth in the district court\u2019s order, we conclude Torres is not entitled to a COA.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-11\">A. <em>Procedural Default</em></p>\n<p id=\"b812-12\">We first consider whether Torres procedurally defaulted any of his claims. On habeas review, federal courts do not review claims that have been defaulted in state courts on an independent and adequate state procedural ground, unless the petitioner demonstrates cause for the de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"787\">*787</page-number>fault and actual prejudice, or alternatively demonstrates a fundamental miscarriage of justice. <em>McCracken v. Gibson, </em>268 F.3d 970, 976 (10th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b813-5\">The district court concluded Torres proeedurally defaulted on the following claims: (1) the trial court violated his Sixth Amendment rights when it admitted gruesome autopsy photographs \u2014 other than state\u2019s Exhibits 22 and 31<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u2014 into evidence; and (2) the trial court erred in allowing the state to introduce testimony of six expert witnesses<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> on shaken baby syndrome. <em>Torres v. Roberts, </em>No. 06-3237-KHV, 2007 WL 1662645, at *8 (D.Kan. June 5, 2007). We agree with the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-6\">Torres raised both of these contentions in his direct appeal to the Kansas Supreme Court, and the court declined to consider these issues because he had not preserved the issues at trial. In reaching this conclusion, the court relied upon the following state procedural rule: a timely and specific objection to the admission of evidence is necessary to preserve an issue for appeal. <em>State v. Torres, </em>280 Kan. 309, 121 P.3d 429, 442-43, 446 (2005) (citing <em>State v. Diggs, </em>272 Kan. 349, 34 P.3d 63, 75 (2001)).</p>\n<p id=\"b813-7\">The Kansas Supreme Court\u2019s application of its preservation rule is an independent and adequate state law ground to default Torres\u2019s claims. Torres asserts no cause for the default. Nor has he shown the probability of actual innocence required by the fundamental miscarriage of justice exception. <em>See Bousley v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 614, 623, 118 S.Ct. 1604, 140 L.Ed.2d 828 (1998). For these reasons, we conclude he defaulted on both claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-12\">B. <em>Torres\u2019s Reviewable Claims</em></p>\n<p id=\"b813-13\">The following claims are reviewable. The district court did not err in concluding they would not support habeas relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-14\">1. <em>Sufficiency of Evidence Regarding Felony Murder</em></p>\n<p id=\"b813-15\">The Kansas Supreme Court rejected Torres\u2019s claim that there was insufficient evidence of felony murder. <em>Torres, </em>121 P.3d at 437. In reaching this conclusion, it applied a standard of review nearly identical to the one required under <em>Jackson v. Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 319, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979). Because the court reasonably applied the correct standard to the facts of the case, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254, we conclude Torres is not entitled to a COA on this ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-16\">2. <em>Sixth Amendment Right to Confrontation</em></p>\n<p id=\"b813-17\">The Kansas Supreme Court rejected Torres\u2019s argument that the trial court violated his Sixth Amendment right to confront witnesses when it admitted the statements he made to law enforcement officers. <em>Torres, </em>121 P.3d at 437-38. The court explained <em>Crawford v. Washington, </em>541 U.S. 36, 53-54, 124 S.Ct. 1354, 158 L.Ed.2d 177 (2004), did not prohibit the district court from admitting these statements, even though Torres did not testify. <em>Torres, </em>121 P.3d at 438. We agree that no clear authority exists for the proposition that the Sixth Amendment guarantees a right to \u201cconfront oneself\u2019 at trial. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Brown, </em>441 F.3d 1330, 1359 (11th Cir .2006), <em>cert. denied, \u2014U</em>.S.-, 127 S.Ct. 1149, 166 L.Ed.2d 998 (2007) (holding district court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"788\">*788</page-number>did not violate Sixth Amendment by admitting defendant\u2019s out-of-court statement) (citing <em>United States v. Zizzo, </em>120 F.3d 1338, 1354 (7th Cir.1997); <em>United States v. Moran, </em>759 F.2d 777, 786 (9th Cir.1985); <em>United States v. Rios Ruiz, </em>579 F.2d 670, 676-77 (1st Cir.1978); 4 Jack B. Weinstein &amp; Margaret A. Berger, <em>Weinstein\u2019s Federal Evidence </em>\u00a7 802.05[3][d] at 802-25 (2d ed.2005) (explaining \u201ca party cannot seriously claim that his or her own statement should be excluded because it was not made under oath or subject to cross-examination\u201d)); <em>United States v. Lafferty, </em>387 F.Supp.2d 500, 511 (W.D.Pa.2005) (\u201cInherent in Justice Scalia\u2019s analysis in the <em>Crawford </em>opinion was the idea that the right of confrontation exists as to accusations of third parties implicating a criminal defendant, not a criminal defendant implicating herself.\u201d); <em>but see United States v. Gibson, </em>409 F.3d 325, 338 (6th Cir.2005) (implying admission of an out-of-court confession by defendant might raise confrontation problems under Crawford). We conclude the court\u2019s decision was not contrary to, nor an unreasonable application of <em>Crawford.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b814-4\">3. <em>Failure to Record Interviews</em></p>\n<p id=\"b814-5\">Torres claims the state violated his right to due process when it did not record his two interviews with law enforcement officers. In <em>Arizona v. Youngblood, </em>the Court explained a defendant could set forth a due process violation by showing police acted in bad faith in failing to preserve evidence \u201cthat [] could have been subjected to tests, the results of which might have exonerated the defendant.\u201d <em>Arizona v. Youngblood, </em>488 U.S. 51, 57, 109 S.Ct. 333, 102 L.Ed.2d 281 (1988). The Kansas Supreme Court interpreted <em>Youngblood </em>as holding absent bad faith, the failure to preserve evidence potentially useful to the defendant does not violate due process. <em>Torres, </em>121 P.3d at 438-39; <em>see also Bullock v. Carver, </em>297 F.3d 1036, 1056 (10th Cir.2002) (interpreting <em>Young-blood </em>in a similar manner).</p>\n<p id=\"b814-7\">The Kansas Supreme Court concluded Torres had not demonstrated that law enforcement officials acted in bad faith, and it noted neither Kansas law nor federal law required officers to record the interviews. It also properly rejected Torres\u2019s claim that the trial court erred in failing to instruct the jury that it could draw a negative inference from the state\u2019s failure to record the interview.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-8\">We conclude the court\u2019s interpretation and application of <em>Youngblood </em>was reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-9\">4. <em>Alleged Miranda Violation</em></p>\n<p id=\"b814-10\">Torres argues the law enforcement officers who interviewed him violated his <em>Miranda </em>rights, <em>Miranda v. Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 444-45, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966), and therefore the district court erred by not suppressing these statements. The Kansas Supreme Court held the interviews were not custodial interrogations requiring <em>Miranda </em>warnings. <em>Torres, </em>121 P.3d at 441. We conclude this determination was reasonable and neither contrary to, nor an unreasonable application of <em>Miranda.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b814-11\">5. <em>Jury Instructions Regarding Lesser Included Offenses</em></p>\n<p id=\"b814-12\">Torres claims the trial court violated his right to due process by failing to instruct the jury on the lesser included offenses of reckless second degree murder and reckless involuntary manslaughter. Neither the Tenth Circuit nor the Supreme Court has held a defendant has a constitutional right to an instruction on lesser included offenses in non-capital cases. <em>Beck v. Alabama, </em>447 U.S. 625, 638 n. 14, 100 S.Ct. 2382, 65 L.Ed.2d 392 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"789\">*789</page-number>(1980); <em>Dockins v. Hines, </em>374 F.3d 935, 938 (10th Cir.2004) (\u201cOur precedents establish a rule of \u2018automatic non-reviewability\u2019 for claims based on a state court\u2019s failure, in a non-capital case, to give a lesser included offense instruction.\u201d). This alleged error, therefore, does not entitle Torres to a COA.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-5\">6. <em>Admission of Photographs</em></p>\n<p id=\"b815-6\">Torres contends the admission of numerous autopsy photographs of his daughter violated his right to a fair trial. As explained above, Torres procedurally defaulted on this claim, except for state\u2019s Exhibits 22 and 31. Because the admission of photographs is generally a matter of state evidentiary law, federal courts on habeas review look only to \u201cwhether the admission of the photographs rendered the proceedings fundamentally unfair.\u201d <em>Smallwood v. Gibson, </em>191 F.3d 1257, 1275 (10th Cir.1999). The Kansas Supreme Court determined Exhibits 22 and 31 were probative and rejected Torres\u2019s claim that they were cumulative and overly gruesome. <em>Torres, </em>121 P.3d at 442. In light of the probative value of the photographs, we conclude the admission of these exhibits was not fundamentally unfair.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-7\">7. <em>Alleged Prosecutorial Misconduct</em></p>\n<p id=\"b815-8\">Torres claims the district court erred in denying a motion for mistrial based on the allegation that the prosecutor tampered with a witness. \u201cHabeas relief is available for prosecutorial misconduct only when the misconduct is so egregious that it renders the entire trial fundamentally unfair.\u201d <em>Cummings v. Evans, </em>161 F.3d 610, 618 (10th Cir.1998) (citing <em>Donnelly v. DeChristoforo, </em>416 U.S. 637, 642-48, 94 S.Ct. 1868, 40 L.Ed.2d 431 (1974); <em>Jackson v. Shanks, </em>143 F.3d 1313, 1322 (10th Cir.1998)). Torres alleges the prosecution threatened to take a witness\u2019s child away from her and send her sister to prison if the witness did not change her testimony. The Kansas Supreme Court determined the district court did not abuse its discretion by denying the motion because Torres failed to produce credible evidence showing the alleged misconduct occurred. <em>Torres, </em>121 P.3d at 445. Because the court\u2019s ruling was not contrary to, nor an unreasonable application of United States Supreme Court precedent, we conclude Torres is not entitled to a COA on this ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-10\">8. <em>Illustrations as Demonstrative Evidence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b815-11\">Torres argues the district court erred in allowing the prosecution to present illustrations of \u201cshaken impact\u201d and \u201cshaken baby\u201d syndrome. Torres \u201cmay only obtain habeas relief for an improper state evidentiary ruling \u2018if the alleged error was so grossly prejudicial [that it] fatally infected the trial and denied the fundamental fairness that is the essence of due process.\u2019 \u201d <em>Bullock v. Carver, </em>297 F.3d 1036, 1055 (10th Cir.2002) (quoting <em>Revilla v. Gibson, </em>283 F.3d 1203, 1212 (10th Cir.2002) (internal quotation marks omitted)). The Kansas Supreme Court reviewed these exhibits and determined the district court did not err in admitting these illustrations: they were fair and accurate representations of the human body and they helped expert witness Dr. Dudley explain her testimony. <em>Torres, </em>121 P.3d at 445. We conclude this decision was not contrary to United States Supreme Court precedent, nor did it involve an unreasonable application of federal law.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-12\">9. <em>Dr. Melhorn\u2019s Testimony</em></p>\n<p id=\"b815-13\">Torres contends the district court erred in allowing the state to call six expert witnesses to the stand while he only called one. He argues the sheer number <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"790\">*790</page-number>of the state\u2019s witnesses overpowered his, rendering his trial fundamentally unfair. As explained above, Torres procedurally defaulted on this issue. Torres did, however, preserve his objection to Dr. Mel-horn\u2019s testimony. <em>Torres, </em>121 P.3d at 445-46. Although the Kansas Supreme Court conceded Dr. Melhorn\u2019s testimony was cumulative in part, it determined the admission of this evidence was not an abuse of discretion. <em>Id. </em>at 446.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-4\">In <em>Fox v. Ward, </em>200 F.3d 1286, 1297 (10th Cir.2000), this Circuit held a district court\u2019s admission of testimony from various forensic experts did not render the defendant\u2019s trial fundamentally unfair. The court emphasized each expert was qualified to testify and was subject to cross-examination. Similarly, Dr. Melhorn was qualified to testify and was subjected to cross-examination. Because Torres failed to show the admission of Dr. Mel-horn\u2019s testimony was fundamentally unfair, we conclude the Kansas Supreme Court\u2019s rejection of Torres\u2019s claim did not entitle him to a COA.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-5\">10. <em>Dr. Dudley\u2019s Rebuttal Testimony</em></p>\n<p id=\"b816-6\"> Torres argues Dr. Dudley usurped the role of the jury and denied Torres his right to a fair trial by testifying that his daughter\u2019s death was a homicide and was a \u201ccase example\u201d of shaken baby or shaken impact syndrome. The Kansas Supreme Court concluded Dr. Dudley\u2019s testimony did not go to the ultimate question of Torres\u2019s guilt or innocence. Even if the court erred in admitting the evidence, it did not rise to the level of denying Torres\u2019s constitutional right to a fair trial. <em>Torres, </em>121 P.3d at 446-47. Because the Kansas Supreme Court\u2019s conclusion was reasonable and not contrary to United States Supreme Court precedent, Torres is not entitled to habeas relief on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-7\">11. <em>Cumulative Effect</em></p>\n<p id=\"b816-8\">Finally, the Kansas Supreme Court\u2019s rejection of Torres\u2019s claim based on cumulative error was not contrary to, nor an unreasonable application of federal law. There can be no cumulative error analysis, because this analysis \u201cdoes not apply to the cumulative effect of non-errors.\u201d <em>Moore v. Reynolds, </em>153 F.3d 1086, 1113 (10th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b816-9\">III. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b816-10\">Based on our review of the record, we are not persuaded jurists of reason would disagree with the district court\u2019s disposition of Torres\u2019s petition. Accordingly, we DENY the application for COA, DENY the request for an evidentiary hearing, GRANT the motion to proceed in forma pauperis, and DISMISS the appeal.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b811-21\"> This order is not binding precedent except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata and collateral estoppel.
