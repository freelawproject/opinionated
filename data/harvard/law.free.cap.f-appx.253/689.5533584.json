We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-17\">Because the parties are familiar\u2019 with the facts and procedural history, we do not restate them here except as necessary to explain our disposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-18\">To obtain relief under \u00a7 2254, Collier must show that the state court decision was \u201ccontrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States.\u201d 28 U.S.C. 2254(d)(1); <em>see Williams v. Taylor, </em>529 U.S. 362, 412-13, 120 S.Ct. 1495, 146 L.Ed.2d 389 (2000). We review the last reasoned decision of the state court. <em>See Ylst v. Nunnemaker, </em>501 U.S. 797, 803-04, 111 S.Ct. 2590, 115 L.Ed.2d 706 (1991); <em>Barker v. Fleming, </em>423 F.3d 1085, 1091-92 (9th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b716-19\">First, Collier contends that trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance by misinterpreting his prior gross misdemeanor conviction as a felony and eliciting testimony relating to that conviction at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>trial. An ineffective assistance of counsel claim requires a showing of deficient performance and prejudice. <em>See Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 688, 694, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). The state supreme court addressed prejudice, concluding that Collier failed to demonstrate that any error by counsel \u201crendered the jury\u2019s verdict unreliable.\u201d In light of the evidence presented at trial, this conclusion was not objectively unreasonable. Because courts may consider either prong of <em>Strickland\u2019s </em>test first and need not address both prongs if either one fails, the state supreme court was not required to analyze deficient performance. <em>See Young v. Runnels, </em>435 F.3d 1038, 1043 (9th Cir.2006) (citing <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 697, 104 S.Ct. 2052).</p>\n<p id=\"b717-5\">Second, Collier contends that the evidence presented at trial was insufficient to support his convictions. A sufficiency of the evidence analysis requires a court to decide whether the evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to the prosecution, would allow any rational trier of fact to find the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>See Jackson v. Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 319, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979). Collier was identified at trial as one of three men \u201cexit[ing] a vehicle from which shots had just been fired\u201d and an eyewitness stated that she had seen \u201cthree guys outside and they were firing off guns,\u201d \u201cmaybe two rounds each.\u201d Because a rational trier of fact could find Collier guilty beyond a reasonable doubt, the state supreme court\u2019s decision was not an objectively unreasonable application of <em>Jackson. See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b717-6\">Third, Collier contends that the district court erred by considering evidence not relied upon by the state court when performing its <em>Jackson </em>analysis. However, a reviewing court considers the totality of the evidence when evaluating a state court\u2019s application of <em>Jackson </em>for objective unreasonableness. <em>See Sarausad v. Porter, </em>479 F.3d 671, 678 (9th Cir.2007), <em>vacated in part on other grounds, </em>503 F.3d 822 (9th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b717-8\">Fourth, Collier contends that the trial court\u2019s exclusion of a prior inconsistent written statement violated the Sixth Amendment\u2019s Confrontation Clause. The \u201cConfrontation Clause guarantees only \u2018an <em>opportunity </em>for effective cross-examination, not cross-examination that is effective in whatever way, and to whatever extent, the defense might wish.\u2019 \u201d <em>Kentucky v. Stincer, </em>482 U.S. 730, 739, 107 S.Ct. 2658, 96 L.Ed.2d 631 (1987) (quoting <em>Delaware v. Fensterer, </em>474 U.S. 15, 20, 106 S.Ct. 292, 88 L.Ed.2d 15 (1985)). As the state supreme court noted, \u201cCollier\u2019s attorney questioned Murillo regarding the inconsistencies\u201d between her written statement and her testimony at trial. The only limitation placed on Collier\u2019s cross-examination of Murillo was that the written statement itself was not admitted into evidence. Because defense counsel had a full opportunity to cross-examine Murillo as to the contents of the statement, excluding it did not involve an objectively unreasonable application of clearly established Supreme Court precedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-9\">Collier also raises two uncertified issues, which we construe as a motion to expand the Certificate of Appealability (\u201cCOA\u201d). <em>See </em>9th Cir. R. 22-l(e). \u201cThe required showing for originally obtaining a COA on a claim remains the standard by which this court reviews the broadening of a COA. A habeas petitioner\u2019s assertion of a claim must make a \u2018substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u2019 \u201d <em>Hiivala v. Wood, </em>195 F.3d 1098, 1104 (9th Cir.1999) (quoting 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2)). Neither of Collier\u2019s two issues meets this standard and thus we decline to expand the COA.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>Collier first contends that we should consider his ineffective assistance of counsel at sentencing claim. Because counsel advanced numerous arguments at sentencing, whether counsel\u2019s failure to do even more constituted deficient performance is not debatable among jurists of reason. <em>See Morrison v. Mahoney, </em>399 F.3d 1042, 1047 (9th Cir.2005) (refusing to expand COA because ineffective assistance of counsel claim not debatable among jurists of reason).</p>\n<p id=\"b718-4\">Finally, Collier contends that the district court erred by denying his motion for an evidentiary hearing. However, as noted by the district court, Collier made \u201conly a conclusory assertion,\u201d and provided \u201cabsolutely no argument in the COA application in any way tending to establish how the requirements for a evidentiary hearing ... were satisfied.\u201d This claim, too, is not debatable among jurists of reason.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b716-11\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
