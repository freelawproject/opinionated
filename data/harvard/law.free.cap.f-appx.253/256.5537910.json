Janhamir challenges the Board\u2019s finding that she was an arriving alien and inadmissible, and claims that the Notice to Appear charging her with removability is thus null and void. We have reviewed the administrative record and the Board\u2019s decision and conclude that Janhamir\u2019s claims are without merit. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(13)(C) (2000). We accordingly deny the petition for review for the reasons stated by the Board. <em>In re: Janhamir, </em>No. A28-023-510 (B.I.A. July 26, 2005). We deny Janhamir\u2019s motions to strike Respondent\u2019s reply brief, for reproduction of relevant portions of the administrative record, and to substitute certain pages of the administrative record. Finally, we dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-22\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
