For the reasons that follow, we will dismiss his appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b264-16\">On January 3, 2007, Pruden filed a complaint pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. The District Court determined that the injunctive relief Appellant sought was no longer available and dismissed the complaint as moot. Pruden appealed, and we dismissed his appeal for his failure to timely prosecute. C.A. No. 07-1319. Thereafter, Pruden filed several motions requesting counsel and consolidation of his cases. The District Court denied the motions as moot because Pruden\u2019s case had been closed. Pruden appeals from the denial of his third motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-17\">We have jurisdiction over this appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(a)(1). Because Pruden has been granted <em>in forma pauperis </em>status pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915, we review this appeal for possible dismissal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B). An appeal may be dismissed if it has no arguable basis in law or fact. <em>Neitzke v. Williams, </em>490 U.S. 319, 325, 109 S.Ct. 1827, 104 L.Ed.2d 338 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b264-18\">We conclude that the District Court properly denied Pruden\u2019s motion for counsel and motion to consolidate as moot. Because Pruden\u2019s complaint had been dismissed and the action closed, the District Court had no alternative except to deny the motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-19\">For the foregoing reasons, we will dismiss this appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B). Pruden\u2019s motion for counsel is denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
