Bukszpan denying Sun\u2019s applications for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). <em>In re Sun, </em>No. A 77 997 792 (B.I.A. Jan. 16, 2007), <em>aff'g </em>No. A 77 997 792 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City Aug. 24, 2005). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-23\">When the BIA does not expressly \u201cadopt\u201d the IJ\u2019s decision, but its brief opinion closely tracks the IJ\u2019s reasoning, this Court can consider both the IJ\u2019s and the BIA\u2019s opinions for the sake of completeness if doing so does not affect the Court\u2019s ultimate conclusion, which it does not here. <em>Jigme Wangchuck v. Dep\u2019t of Homeland Sec., </em>448 F.3d 524, 528 (2d Cir.2006). This Court reviews the agency\u2019s factual findings under the substantial evidence standard. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>see, e.g., Zhou Yun Zhang v. INS, </em>386 F.3d 66, 73 &amp; n. 7 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>(2d Cir.2004), <em>overruled in part on other grounds by Shi Liang Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>494 F.3d 296, 305 (2d Cir.2007) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b130-4\">As an initial matter, petitioners must have raised to the BIA the specific issues they later seek to raise in this Court. <em>See Foster v. INS, </em>376 F.3d 75, 78 (2d Cir.2004). While not jurisdictional, this judicially imposed exhaustion requirement is mandatory. <em>Lin Zhong v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>480 F.3d 104, 119-20 (2d Cir.2007). At Sun\u2019s hearing the IJ specifically asked, \u201c[Wjhat is the theory of your claim?\u201d to which Sun\u2019s counsel replied that his claim was based only on his father\u2019s practice of Falun Gong; he did not assert the claim he now seeks to present on appeal \u2014 that China engaged in a pattern or practice of persecuting Falun Gong practitioners. The regulations make clear that a pattern and practice claim is a distinct basis for relief from that based on an individual risk of persecution. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.13(b)(2); <em>Steevenez v. Gonzales, </em>476 F.3d 114, 117-18 (2d Cir.2007). The Government has raised this failure to exhaust in its brief to this Court, and we therefore decline to consider Sun\u2019s pattern or practice claim asserted before us. <em>See Lin Zhong, </em>480 F.3d at 115.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">Substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s finding that Sun did not suffer past persecution because the IJ accurately observed that Sun was never arrested, threatened, or otherwise mistreated. <em>See Zhou Yun Zhang, </em>386 F.3d at 73 <em>&amp; </em>n. 7; <em>Ivanishvili v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>433 F.3d 332, 341 (2d Cir.2006). We are similarly unable to find that the agency erred in concluding that Sun did not establish a well-founded fear of future persecution. The agency acknowledged that Sun\u2019s father had been arrested for practicing Falun Gong, <em>cf. Poradisova v. Gonzales, </em>420 F.3d 70, 80 (2d Cir.2005), but reasonably found that Sun\u2019s fear was speculative where nothing in the record indicated he, individually, was threatened with persecution. <em>See Jian Xing Huang v. INS, </em>421 F.3d 125, 129 (2d Cir.2005) (finding that a fear is not objectively reasonable if it lacks \u201csolid support\u201d in the record and is merely \u201cspeculative at best\u201d). Additionally, the agency accurately found that the background materials do not indicate that the Chinese government persecutes family members of Falun Gong practitioners.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-7\">Therefore, the IJ properly denied Sun\u2019s application for asylum where he did not establish a well-founded fear of persecution. Because Sun was unable to show the objective likelihood of persecution needed to make out an asylum claim, he was necessarily unable to meet the higher standard required to succeed on a claim for withholding of removal. <em>See Paul v. Gonzales, </em>444 F.3d 148, 156 (2d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b130-8\">Sun did not sufficiently challenge the IJ\u2019s denial of CAT relief in his brief to this Court. <em>See Yueqing Zhang v. Gonzales, </em>426 F.3d 540, 545 n. 7 (2d Cir.2005) (finding that a petitioner abandoned a claim where the petitioner \u201cdevotes only a single conclusory sentence to the argument\u201d). As such, we deem that claim abandoned. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b130-9\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. As we have completed our review, any pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot. Any pending request for oral argument in this petition is DENIED in accordance with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 34(a)(2), and Second Circuit Local Rule 34(d)(1).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
