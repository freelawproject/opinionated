We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and relevant procedural history of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-14\">Alshalabi argues that the district court abused its discretion in denying his motion to withdraw his guilty plea. Under Fed. R.Crim.P. 11(d)(2)(B), a defendant \u201cmay withdraw a plea of guilty ... after the court accepts the plea, but before it imposes sentence^] if ... the defendant can show a fair and just reason for requesting the withdrawal.\u201d We review a district court\u2019s denial of a motion to withdraw a plea of guilty for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Maher, </em>108 F.3d 1513, 1529 (2d Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b94-15\">Alshalabi sought to withdraw his plea in the district court on the grounds that he is innocent, lacked sufficient time with his attorney, was hampered by the use of a translator, and did not sufficiently understand the law. We find that the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying his motion. Alshalabi\u2019s claim of innocence is belied by the unequivocal statements he made on the record concerning his guilt. <em>Maher, </em>108 F.3d at 1530 (\u201cThe self-inculpatory statements he made under oath at his plea allocution \u2018carry a strong presumption of verity.\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Black-</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number><em>ledge v. Allison, </em>431 U.S. 63, 74, 97 S.Ct. 1621, 52 L.Ed.2d 136 (1977))). Moreover, prior to accepting Alshalabi\u2019s plea, Judge Dearie asked several times, and in several different ways, whether Alshalabi had adequate time with his attorney, was satisfied with the representation she had provided, and understood the charges to which he was pleading guilty. The district court considered Alshalabi\u2019s demeanor, education level, and took great care in confirming the voluntariness of his decision to plead guilty. Under these circumstances, we find no abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-5\">Accordingly, the district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
