ANDERSON, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b745-15\">In a prior order, this panel has determined unanimously to grant the parties\u2019 request for a decision on the briefs without oral argument. See Fed. R.App. P. 34(f); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-16\">Defendant-appellant Brian B. Tucker pled guilty, pursuant to a plea agreement, to aiding and abetting armed bank robbery, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2113(a), (d) and 2; aiding and abetting the using and carrying of a firearm in relation to a crime of violence, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 924(c) and 2; using an explosive to commit a felony, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 844(h)(1) and 2; and aiding and abetting bank robbery, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2113(a) and 2. Tucker was sentenced to twelve years\u2019 imprisonment, followed by four years of supervised release. Tucker appeals, arguing the government breached the plea agreement. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-17\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b745-18\">The facts are not disputed and, as detailed in Tucker\u2019s statement in advance of plea, reveal the following: On February 20, 2004, Tucker aided and abetted in the commission of an armed bank robbery at the Far West Bank in Orem, Utah, in which two other defendants, Troy Wendall Hansen and Steven Bennett Bingham, obtained approximately $2,200. Hansen carried a shotgun into the bank and discharged a shell into a wall; Bingham carried a handgun. Tucker assisted in the robbery by creating a diversion across town by placing an explosive device underneath a car and calling in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>bomb threat to police, and by calling another bank and telling a bank employee that he (Tucker) had placed a bomb in the bank building. On March 5, 2004, Tucker assisted in planning and shared in the proceeds of an unarmed robbery at Zion\u2019s Bank in Herriman, Utah, in which Bingham and Hansen entered the bank and obtained approximately $78,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-4\">After his arrest, Tucker agreed to plead guilty to four counts originating out of the robberies, in exchange for several promises from the government. Pursuant to the plea agreement, the government agreed to recommend \u201cthe ten year minimum mandatory consecutive sentence as provided for pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c).\u201d Statement by Defendant in Advance of Plea of Guilty at H 12(B)(2), R. Vol. III at Doc. 140 (hereafter \u201cStatement\u201d). The government made no specific sentencing recommendations regarding the other three counts to which Tucker agreed to plead guilty. The government also agreed to recommend a two or three level reduction in Tucker\u2019s offense level under the advisory United States Sentencing Commission, <em>Guidelines Manual </em>(\u201cUSSG\u201d), if Tucker demonstrated an acceptance of responsibility, and agreed to consider filing a motion for a downward departure for substantial assistance under USSG \u00a7 5K1.1, which would permit the district court to sentence below any applicable statutory minimum sentences.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b746-8\">In preparation for sentencing, the United States Probation Office prepared a presentence report (\u201cPSR\u201d) which calculated an advisory sentencing range under the Guidelines of forty-six to fifty-seven months\u2019 imprisonment. Additionally, as the PSR noted, the \u00a7 924(c) (use of a firearm) and the \u00a7 844(h) (use of an explosive) each carried a statutory minimum ten-year prison term, to be served consecutively to any other sentences imposed.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Thus, Tucker faced a possible sentence totaling 286 to 297 months, if the two consecutive statutory minimum terms of ten years were imposed consecutively to the advisory Guideline sentence of forty-six to fifty-seven years.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-9\">Prior to sentencing, the government did file a \u00a7 5K1.1 motion, based upon Tucker\u2019s substantial assistance, thereby allowing the district court to sentence below the twenty-year statutory minimum. At sentencing, the government recommended a total term of fifteen years\u2019 imprisonment for all four counts of conviction. The district court imposed a twelve-year sentence. Tucker appeals, arguing the government breached the plea agreement by recom<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>mending a sentence of more than ten years for all four counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b747-6\">\u201cThis Court reviews <em>de novo </em>the question of whether the government has breached the plea agreement, even when the defendant fails to preserve this objection below.\u201d <em>United States v. VanDam, </em>493 F.3d 1194, 1199 (10th Cir.2007). \u201cGeneral principles of contract law define the content and scope of the government\u2019s obligations under a plea agreement.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cWe thus look to the express language in the agreement to identify both the nature of the government\u2019s promise and the defendant\u2019s reasonable understanding of this promise at the time of the entry of the guilty plea.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We must \u201cconstrue all ambiguities against the government, to the extent it is the drafting party.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Finally, \u201c[w]e evaluate the record as a whole to ascertain whether the government complied with its promise.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b747-7\">The plea agreement in this case specifically acknowledged that count II of the indictment (using and carrying a firearm in relation to a crime of violence, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)) carried a minimum mandatory sentence of ten years, to run consecutively to any other sentence imposed. It further specifically acknowledged that count V of the indictment (using an explosive to commit a felony, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 844(h)(1) and (2)) carried a ten-year sentence, in addition to any sentence imposed for the underlying felony.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b747-8\">As indicated, in exchange for Tucker\u2019s guilty pleas to the four counts, the government agreed to recommend a two- or three-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility. Additionally, and of particular importance to this case, the government further agreed to \u201c[rjecommend the ten (10) year minimum mandatory consecutive sentence as provided for pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c).\u201d Statement at 1112(B)(2). The government also agreed to dismiss two of the counts in the six-count indictment and to move for a Rule 35 reduction in sentence \u201cafter the defendant has been sentenced and after he has provided truthful information and/or testimony regarding the bank robberies, specifically the Grand Junction case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1112(B)(4). Finally, in addition to agreeing not to indict Tucker\u2019s wife, the government agreed to evaluate whether to file a motion for a \u00a7 5K1.1 downward departure based on Tucker\u2019s substantial assistance, although the government agreed that \u201cin the event that the Government deems that a \u00a7 5K1.1 departure is not appropriate and does not make a motion for downward departure it will NOT be grounds for the defendant to withdraw his plea of guilty.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at It 12(B)(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b747-11\">Pointing to the sentence in the plea agreement where the government agreed to recommend the ten-year \u201cminimum mandatory consecutive sentence as provided pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c),\u201d Tucker argues the plain language of the plea agreement demonstrates that the government agreed to recommend a total sentence of ten years on all counts. He further argues that, given his lack of sophistication, that was his understanding of the government\u2019s promise when he signed the plea agreement. Thus, he argues, the government breached the terms of the plea agreement when, at sentencing, it recommended a fifteen-year sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>To resolve this issue under our precedents as stated above, we examine the language of the plea agreement in order to identify \u201cboth the nature of the government\u2019s promise and the defendant\u2019s reasonable understanding of this promise at the time of the entry of the guilty plea.\u201d <em>VanDam, </em>493 F.3d at 1199. We start with the language of the plea agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-4\">The plea agreement contains the government\u2019s commitment to recommend the \u201cminimum mandatory <em>consecutive </em>sentence as provided pursuant to \u00a7 924(c).\u201d By its plain terms, the agreement gave notice to Tucker that the ten-year sentence recommendation related to the \u00a7 924(c) count, and that it was consecutive to any other sentence imposed. Tucker argues it implicitly conveyed the commitment that the government would not recommend any <em>other </em>sentence beyond the ten-year sentence. We do not agree with Tucker that the plea agreement contained that implicit commitment. Its plain language simply does not support such a construction \u2014 it specifically related to only one of the four counts for which Tucker would be sentenced, and it indicated it would be consecutive to any other sentence. There would be no reason to refer to the ten-year sentence as \u201cconsecutive\u201d if it was the only sentence the government was permitted to recommend. Nor would it make sense to specifically reference \u00a7 924(c), if the government\u2019s commitment actually related to all four counts of conviction. Thus, the government\u2019s silence on any sentencing recommendation on the remaining three counts does not, in our view, constitute an agreement to not recommend any sentence on any of those other counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-5\">Further, we must \u201c \u2018evaluate the promise in light of the defendant\u2019s reasonable understanding of the promise at the time of the guilty plea.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Rodriguez-Delma, </em>456 F.3d 1246, 1250 (10th Cir.2006) (quoting <em>United States v. Guzman, </em>318 F.3d 1191, 1195-96 (10th Cir.2003)), ce<em>rt. denied, </em>\u2014U.S.-, 127 S.Ct. 1338, 167 L.Ed.2d 134 (2007). We conduct our analysis in light of the entire record. <em>See id. </em>at 1251 (finding no breach of plea agreement after \u201cconsideration of the entire record\u201d). We begin our examination of the record by considering what occurred, and what representations were made by the government concerning its sentencing recommendation, at the change of plea hearing in which Tucker pled guilty in accordance with the plea agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-9\">In the change of plea hearing, the district court began by reviewing the plea agreement. It initially noted that the plea agreement did not make it clear that the ten-year sentence for count V, using an explosive to commit a felony, was a mandatory minimum to be imposed consecutively to any sentence for the underlying felony. This led to the district court\u2019s express statement to Tucker as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b748-10\">[T]o summarize, ... count one charges you with armed bank robbery and it carries a maximum penalty of 25 years. It could be much lower than that. Count two charges you with using and carrying a firearm in relation to a crime of violence and carries a minimum mandatory sentence of ten years. That is above and on top of and in addition to and consecutive to whatever you get for the armed bank robbery, and then you have in count five this crime charging you with using an explosive to commit a felony, and that has an additional mandatory minimum requirement of at least ten years.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b748-11\">Tr. of Change of Plea at 6, R. Vol. VII. This, in turn, led to Tucker\u2019s counsel asking that the district court clarify for Tucker whether the ten-year sentence for using the explosive would have to run consecutively to the ten-year sentence for carrying <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>a firearm, or was it possible for them to run concurrently. After the district court expressed dismay that the parties had not clarified everything in the plea agreement, the court informed Tucker:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b749-5\">I don\u2019t have any discretion for the gun charge, and then another ten years mandatory for the explosives charge. I think you are probably looking at 20 years mandatory plus whatever you get on the bank robbery. That is my guess just based on many sentences in the past. I don\u2019t know. I think that is a pretty important thing for you to have straight before you enter a plea of guilty.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b749-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-7\">Government counsel subsequently informed the court that a USSG \u00a7 5K1.1 motion to depart downward based on substantial assistance would be filed, which led to Tucker himself asking the district court the following: \u201cgiven the nature of the mandatory ten years and the minimum mandatory, how much discretion do you have with those two given the government motions to go below them?\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 11. The court responded, \u201c[Ojnee the 5K1.1 is filed by the prosecutor, I can fall all the way to the bottom.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b749-8\">After further colloquy, the district court reminded Tucker that, should the government not file a \u00a7 5K1.1 motion for downward departure, he could not \u201ccome back in here and set aside the plea that [he] ha[d] entered today.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 27. Tucker indicated he understood. From our review of the record, there was no discussion at all at the change of plea hearing concerning a sentencing recommendation by the government.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-9\">The government then filed, as it had indicated it would, a USSG \u00a7 5K1.1 motion for a downward departure based upon Tucker\u2019s substantial assistance. In that motion, the government stated as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b749-10\"><em>It is the motion of the Government that the defendant receives no additional sentence for Count I, Armed Bank Robbery and Count VI, Bank Robbery. The defendant must currently serve a minimum mandatory ten-year sentence for Counts II and IV </em>Based upon the defendant\u2019s assistance in the investigation of several cases ... where the defendant has identified several suspects. Although the information provided by the defendant has not led to any arrests or prosecutions the defendant has provided said information.... Pursuant to the Sentencing Guidelines ... the defendant\u2019s total offense level is 23, with a criminal history category of I resulting in a range of 46-57 months. <em>Additionally, the defendant must serve minimum maudatoiy terns of 120 months, in Counts II and V by statute. </em>A downward departure requesting no additional sentence on Counts I and VI would have no impact on the statutory sentence as required in Counts II and V.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b749-11\">Gov.\u2019s Mot. for Downward Departure Pursuant to USSG \u00a7 5K1.1 at 1-2, R. Vol. III (emphasis added). Thus, the government represented that it would not recommend any additional sentence beyond that required under the two mandatory statutory ten-year provisions for possessing the firearm and the explosive. We find no other representations by the government regarding sentencing anywhere in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-12\">From that review of the record, we must assess Tucker\u2019s \u201creasonable understanding,\u201d <em>VanDam, </em>493 F.3d at 1199, of the government\u2019s promise in the plea agreement to recommend a ten-year \u201cminimum mandatory consecutive sentence as provided for pursuant to ... \u00a7 924(c).\u201d Statement at H 12(B)(2). In our view, Tucker\u2019s questions at the change of plea proceeding indicated he was hardly unsophisticated, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>and, indeed, indicated that he understood the sentencing options available to the court.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Further, the court\u2019s comments at the change of plea proceeding conveyed to Tucker that he faced a substantial sentence, including mandatory statutory sentences totaling twenty years, which <em>could </em>be reduced depending on the degree of his assistance to the government. Thus, as the district court informed Tucker, if a successful \u00a7 5K1.1 motion was filed, the court could depart below the statutory mandatory ten-year terms for the firearms and explosives charges. In that context, the government\u2019s recommendation in the plea agreement that Tucker serve the ten-year minimum mandatory sentence for the \u00a7 924(c) conviction was meaningful \u2014 the government, in other words, recommended that the district court should not depart below that ten-year sentence, even though, following the \u00a7 5K1.1 motion, it would have discretion to do so. However, nowhere did the government agree to recommend a total sentence of ten years for all counts, and we discern no indication that Tucker was anything other than completely aware of what sentencing prospects he faced, and completely aware that, depending on the extent of his \u00a7 5K1.1 substantial assistance, his sentence could drop to some indeterminate level below the otherwise-applicable two ten-year statutory mandatory sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-4\">We therefore conclude that Tucker reasonably understood that the government would recommend that he serve ten years for the \u00a7 924(c) count, but that there was a possibility of a longer sentence, depending primarily on how the \u00a7 5K1.1 motion developed. While the plea agreement was perhaps not a model of clarity, the district court adroitly clarified any confusion and ensured that Tucker understood the sentencing ranges he faced. Moreover, there was no ambiguity as to the government\u2019s sentencing recommendation. And, the government\u2019s position remained consistent throughout \u2014 from the plea agreement, where it agreed to recommend ten years for the \u00a7 924(c) notwithstanding the possibility that the district court could sentence beneath any applicable mandatory statutory sentence if a \u00a7 5K1.1 motion was filed; through the change of plea hearing, where Tucker was informed that the statutory terms, including the \u00a7 924(c) term, would apply unless a successful \u00a7 5K1.1 motion permitted the district court to sentence to a lower term; through the \u00a7 5K1.1 motion itself, where the government moved for no further sentence beyond the statutory terms, including the \u00a7 924(c) ten-year term.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-11\">Subsequently, at sentencing, the government explained its position on sentencing as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b750-12\">I would ask the Court to focus on the nature and circumstances of the offenses. It is true that Mr. Tucker has provided some information to the government. Some of the information was quite good, and most recently I really thought that we could help Mr. Tucker even more, except the prosecutors in the case that he provided- information on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number>decided he just had too much liability with them in his testimony and chose not to use him based upon that and because of this case....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b751-5\">Judge, he is facing roughly 24 years in prison with the minimum mandatories. I still believe that a significant sentence should be imposed for a couple of reasons. The nature and circumstances of the case, and they are most egregious, ... [and] most recently ... the defendant\u2019s motions before this Court where he seems to minimize his role in these cases significantly.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b751-6\">The factors under 3553 I think will be met if the Court were to impose a 15-year sentence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b751-7\">Tr. of Sentencing at 9-10, R. Vol. VIII. Government counsel explained that the government\u2019s additional reason for recommending the fifteen-year sentence was because Tucker\u2019s co-defendants, Hansen and Bingham, both cooperated and received ten-year sentences, whereas \u201cMr. Tucker has not cooperated to that degree, at least not involving this particular case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-8\">The district court ultimately sentenced Tucker to twelve years, and explained that the court felt that sentence was \u201cconsistent\u201d with the sentences imposed on Hansen and Bingham:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b751-9\">I do think it is worth a couple of extra years for your lack of coming forward, and especially with the generosity of the government with the substantial assistance motion that they have made. I could sit here and very easily in this case have decided not to grant any departure based on that motion. I frankly could make a very good, strong position that you have not rendered substantial assistance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b751-10\">I am troubled by the level of animosity and hatred and vitriol that was passed from the family of the defendant to law enforcement including you, Mr. Tucker. You stated the authorities used every means to obtain a guilty plea. They threatened to indict my wife and further jeopardize my children. Those kinds of outrageous comments \u2014 again, in many ways the best thing you could have done was plead guilty in this case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b751-11\"><em>Id. </em>at 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-12\">After carefully reviewing the entire record, we conclude that the government did not breach the plea agreement when it recommended a fifteen-year sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-13\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b751-14\">For the foregoing reasons, the sentence is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b745-12\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel.
