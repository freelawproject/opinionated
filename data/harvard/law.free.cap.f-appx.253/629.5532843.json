We affirm. Because the parties are familiar with the factual and procedural history of this case, we need not recount it here.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-27\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b655-28\">Under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (\u201cAEDPA\u201d), a federal court may not grant a writ of habeas corpus challenging a state conviction on the basis of a claim that was reviewed on the merits in state court unless the state court\u2019s adjudication of the claim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>\u201c(1) resulted in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States; or (2) resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b656-4\">A state court decision is \u201ccontrary to\u201d Supreme Court authority only if \u201cthe state court arrives at a conclusion opposite to that reached by [the Supreme] Court on a question of law or if the state court decides a case differently than [the Supreme] Court has on a set of materially indistinguishable facts.\u201d <em>Williams v. Taylor, </em>529 U.S. 362, 412-13, 120 S.Ct. 1495, 146 L.Ed.2d 389 (2000). A state court decision is an \u201cunreasonable application of\u2019 Supreme Court authority if it correctly identifies the governing legal principle from the Supreme Court\u2019s decisions but \u201cunreasonably applies that pxinciple to the facts of the prisoner\u2019s case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 413, 120 S.Ct. 1495.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-5\">Under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(2), \u201c[factual determinations by state courts are presumed cox'rect absent clear and convincing evidence to the contrary\u201d and a state coux\u2019t decision \u201cbased on a factual determination will not be overturned on factual grounds unless objectively unreasonable in light of the evidence presented in the state-court proceeding.\u201d <em>Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 340, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003). On habeas review, a state trial court\u2019s findings regarding juror fitness are entitled to \u201cspecial deference.\u201d <em>Perez v. Marshall, </em>119 F.3d 1422, 1426 (9th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b656-6\">In conducting review of a state court decision, we \u201clook to the last reasoned state-court decision.\u201d <em>Van Lynn v. Farmon, </em>347 F.3d 735, 738 (9th Cir.2003). Because the Supreme Court of Califoxmia declined review of Mr. Hightower\u2019s case, we review the California Court of Appeal\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-8\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b656-9\">The district court did not ex\u2019r in denying habeas relief on Hightower\u2019s claim that the state trial court\u2019s investigation of juror misconduct was overly intrusive in violation of his right to trial by jury. The record supports the California Court of Appeal\u2019s conclusion that the trial court\u2019s investigation was a proper exercise of its authority under California law. After a careful review of the record, we cannot say that the state court\u2019s factual determination that the juror was unwilling to deliberate and had been asleep during portions of the trial was objectively unreasonable in light of the evidence presented in the state court proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-10\">The removal of the lone holdout juror does give rise to concern and, under certain circumstances, it has warranted the gx\u2019ant of habeas relief. <em>Sanders v. Lamarque, </em>357 F.3d 943, 944 (9th Cir.2004). But the fact that a trial judge knows that a juror is a lone holdout does not, by itself, invalidate the decision to excuse the juror for cause. <em>Perez v. Marshall, </em>119 F.3d 1422, 1427 (9th Cir.1997). Here, in view of the recox\u2019d, we cannot say that the state court unreasonably applied Supreme Court precedent in reaching its conclusions. Therefore, federal habeas relief is not warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b655-29\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
