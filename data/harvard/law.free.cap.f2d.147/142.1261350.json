United States, 9 Cir., 299 F. 407, 411, certiorari denied 266 U.S. 611, 45 S.Ct. 94, 69 L.Ed. 467; United States v. Antonelli Fireworks Co., D.C.W.D.N.Y., 53 F.Supp. 870, 874; United States v. Ruffner, D.C.Md., 51 F.2d 579; United States v. Sergio, D.C. E.D.N.Y., 21 F.Supp. 553; United States v. Thomson, 7 Cir., 113 F.2d 643, 644, 129 A. L.R. 1291; State v. Griswold, 67 Conn. 290, 34 A. 1046, 33 L.R.A. 227. Moreover, the papers show an issue, raised by the superintendent at the time of search, and later in an affidavit presented by petitioner, that the particular spot where alcohol was found was in the possession not of the owner, but of a tenant. United States v. Ebeling, 2 Cir., 146 F.2d 254, and cases cited; Matthews v. Correa, 2 Cir., 135 F.2d 534, 537; Schnitzer v. United States, 8 Cir., 77 F.2d 233, 235. Petitioner appears to have been content to rely upon affidavits; if, however, he has additional facts to offer, the opportunity given him to renew his motion at trial, should one be had, affords him ample protection.
