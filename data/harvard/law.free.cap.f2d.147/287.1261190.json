NLRB v. Bank of America, 9 Cir., 130 F.2d 624. The employee was reinstated but was subsequently discharged for the ostensible reason that he was actively prosecuting a libel suit against the respondent, filed after the entry of the Board\u2019s order and prior to our own decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-24\">The respondent has answered the petition and the Board has filed a reply. In these pleadings certain controversial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>matters are developed but the controversies are <em>primarily, </em>if <em>not </em>entirely, concerned with inferences to be drawn from facts themselves not substantially in dispute. Acr cordingly, the matter may appropriately be disposed of on the pleadings.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-4\">On the whole showing we are not persuaded that respondent has acted otherwise than in good faith, or that its conduct in discharging the named employee was in contempt of the letter or spirit of our decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">The petition is accordingly dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
