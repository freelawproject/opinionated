On September 27, 1943, judgment was entered as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b250-24\">\u201cIt is Hereby Ordered, Adjudged and Decreed that plaintiff herein recover nothing against the said defendants [David C. Jeffcott and Elsie Jeffcott], or either of them, and that the said defendants recover of plaintiff the sum of Eight Hundred Sixty-four and 72/100 Dollars ($864.72) costs taxed and allowed by said Circuit Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, and that said defendants have execution therefor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b250-25\">That judgment was a final decision, within the meaning of \u00a7 128(a) of the Judicial Code, 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 225(a), and hence was appealable, but no appeal was taken therefrom.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-26\">On October 1, 1943, plaintiff moved the District Court to vacate the judgment of September 27, 1943, and to rehear the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>motion of August 27, 1943. An order denying the motion of October 1, 1943, was entered on December 13, 1943. From that order plaintiff has appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-4\">That order was not a final decision, within the meaning of \u00a7 128(a) of the Judicial Code, 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 225(a), and was not appealable.
