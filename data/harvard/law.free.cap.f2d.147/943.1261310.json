His counsel explained to him each and every charge as contained in the two indictments. Moreover, petitioner and his counsel went over his case, at his request, with the trial judge, consuming more than one hour. Thereafter, petitioner entered pleas of guilty to each of the two indictments.</p>\n<p id=\"b996-11\">No error was committed by the trial court in discharging the writ and remanding petitioner into the custody of the respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b996-12\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
