Raymond A. Gilmartin, the employee, was injured on November 3, 1941, and thereafter was granted an award of $3,805.67 against the bankrupt pursuant to \u00a7 14-a of the New York Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law, Cotisol.Laws, c. 67, the award being duly filed with the State Department of Labor on January 20, 1943. On February 23, 1943, pursuant to \u00a7 26 of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law, the Industrial Commissioner obtained a judgment in the Supreme Court of Queens County against the employer. But the latter had filed a petition for an arrangement in the District Court on February 18, 1943, and it was adjudicated a bankrupt on February 25, 1943. Consequently the Industrial Commissioner on March 8, 1943, duly filed a verified claim asserting a statutory lien for the amount of the award upon the assets of the bankrupt. There were no prior recorded liens, and the assets in the hands of the trustee were sufficient to cover administration expenses and wages in addition to the lien claimed by the Commissioner. The referee directed that any surplus after the payment of wages, administration expenses, and any prior recorded liens he applied to the satisfaction of the Commissioner\u2019s lien; his order was affirmed on the trustee\u2019s petition for review, and the trustee now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>The sole question before us is whether or not \u00a7 34 of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law creates a lien. That section, entitled \u201cPreferences,\u201d provides that the awarded \u201ccompensation shall be a lien against the assets of the carrier or employer without limit of amount subordinate, however, to claims for unpaid wages and prior recorded liens.\u201d As passed originally in 1913, Laws 1913, Ex.Sess., c. 816, it provided for \u201cthe same preference or lien\u201d as that allowed wage claims; it was amended to its present form in 1932. The trustee nevertheless contends that the use of the word \u201clien\u201d in the section is inadvertent, and that merely a state priority is created, which, since the amendment in 1938, is no longer recognized by the Bankruptcy Act, 11 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1 et seq. Strom v. Peikes, 2 Cir., 123 F.2d 1003, 138 A.L.R. 937; 51 Yale L. J. 863. He argues that a lien must be perfected by making it a matter of public record through filing, recording, or docketing, and that there are no such requirements in the present instance. This precise argument was rejected, however, by the Appellate Term in a decision declaring that \u00a7 34 creates a valid statutory lien on a specific deposit claimed by an assignee. Albert Pipe Supply Co. v. Callanan, 159 Misc. 547, 288 N.Y. S. 307, reversing 157 Misc. 136, 283 N.Y. S. 716. True, the trustee cites the recent case of United States v. Waddill, Holland &amp; Flinn, Inc., 323 U.S. -, 65 S.Ct. 304, as holding that state decisions are not controlling in cases such as this; but that case decided only that state decisions cannot defeat the priority given claims of the United States by act of Congress, cf. United States v. State of Texas, 314 U.S. 480, 62 S.Ct. 350, 86 L.Ed. 356, and hence has no particular pertinence here.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-6\">We should use the state decisions to define the interest created by state law, and then it becomes a question under the Bankruptcy Act whether fairly considered the interest thus defined is a lien or merely a preferred claim. Strom v. Peikes, supra; 4 Moore\u2019s Collier on Bankruptcy, 14th Ed. 1942, 111, 171, 172. Here the trustee\u2019s contention must fail, in any event, since \u00a7 34 of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law, when read with \u00a7 20, provides for the filing of an award with the State Department of Labor, thereby prescribing a procedure substantially identical with that contained in statutes requiring the perfection of a lien. This award was filed with the Department of Labor both before bankruptcy and within the period provided by state law. Consequently it comes within the terms, as it seems well within the policy, of \u00a7 67, sub., b, of the Bankruptcy Act, 11 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 107, sub. b, to constitute a valid statutory lien, enforceable against the trustee.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-8\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
