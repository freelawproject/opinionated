In practice, however, their use was confined, largely, to tetra-ethyl. The ultimate question of the case is whether the knowledge of the prior art was sufficient to suggest to a skilled chemist, familiar with gasoline fuels and the operation of internal combustion engines, the particular combinations disclosed in appellant\u2019s claims, or whether those disclosures went so far beyond the prior art as to constitute invention. The District Court found that: \u201c13. The selection of the particular lead alkyls and the proportions thereof to he used in the fuel as recited in Bartholomew\u2019s claims depend upon climatic conditions, the particular type of engine being used, and other factors. The selection is made as a result of experimentation. 14. There is nothing critical in the proportions of the ingredients, more or less indefinitely recited in Bartholomew\u2019s claims at bar. 15. None of Bartholomew\u2019s claims at bar recites anything amounting to an invention over the disclosures made in the patents to Midgley, Sullivan, Voorhees and Shapirio.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b79-26\">We are satisfied from an examination of the record that the findings of the District Court are amply supported by the evidence. What we have here is no more than a showing of great industry in experimental research, insufficient in itself to constitute invention; the product and the process described by the claims differ from the prior art only in degree; the result, useful as it may be, constitutes, merely, one step forward in a gradual process of experimentation.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b79-27\">We conclude, therefore, that appellant is not entitled to a patent.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-28\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b79-21\"> 85 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 63.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b79-22\"> \u201c7.
