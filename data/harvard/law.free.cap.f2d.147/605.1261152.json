Furthermore, the petitioner contends he was not represented by counsel, knew nothing of legal procedure and that he entered his plea believing he was charged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>with a single offense in violation of the National Motor Vehicle Theft Act, 18 U.S. C.A \u00a7 408.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-4\">The lower court found that petitioner had intelligently waived his right to assistance of counsel, that he understood and was not misled as to the offense charged against him, and that he entered pleas of guilty to both counts. On appeal, this court will not disturb such findings. O\u2019Keith v. Johnston, 9 Cir., 146 F.2d 231; Michener v. Johnston, 9 Cir., 141 F.2d 171.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-5\">As to the sufficiency of the indictment, we \u00e1re in accord with the lower court\u2019s conclusion of law that the sufficiency of the indictment is not open to challenge on habeas corpus. Batson v. Squier, 9 Cir., 146 F.2d 264.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
