Taylor and Evelyn Flynn, appeal from a final judgment of the United States District Court, restraining them from violating Maximum Rent Regulation No. 28, issued under the Emergency Price Control Act of 1942, 56 Stat. 23, 50 U.S.C.A.Appendix, \u00a7 901 et seq., hereinafter called the Act.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> This appeal is also from an order adjudging .ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"827\">*827</page-number>pellant, Stanley Taylor, in contempt of court for violation of a temporary restraining order issued in the same action, The appellants, Stanley W. Taylor and Isabelle D. Taylor, are the owners of an apartment house at 530 Larkin Street, San <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"828\">*828</page-number>Francisco, California, and the appellant, Evelyn Flynn, is the manager thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-4\">The Price Administrator filed under Section 205(a) of the Emergency Price Control Act a complaint against the appellants, charging them under counts 1, 3 and 4 thereof with having violated Maximum Rent Regulation 28 as follows: (a) By demanding and receiving higher rents for the apartments than those permitted by the Regulation; . (b) by evicting and attempting to evict certain tenants from the apartments, notwithstanding the fact that under the Act the tenants were lawfully entitled to remain in possession; and (c) by renting and offering for rent housing accommodations without having filed any registration statements as required by the regulation.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AiA\">The complaint concluded with a prayer for a temporary restraining order, a preliminary injunction, and a permanent in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"829\">*829</page-number>junction restraining the appellants from violating the Regulation and requiring them to abide by its terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-4\">Appellants\u2019 answer pleaded that the Act and Regulation were unconstitutional and void and generally denied that they had violated either.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-5\">Upon the filing of the complaint, which was supported by affidavits, a temporary restraining order was issued, enjoining appellants from demanding or receiving for any housing accommodation in the San Francisco Bay Defense-Rental Area (including furniture) (other than a room in a hotel or rooming house) rents or total charges in excess of the rental rate effective on March 1, 1942, and from excluding or threatening or attempting to exclude by any means whatever Lloyd C. Havercroft or any other tenant from possession of any housing accommodations contrary to the provisions of Maximum Rent Regulation No. 28 or contrary to the provisions of Section 4(a) of the Emergency Price Control Act of 1942.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-6\">By successive orders the temporary restraining order was continued in effect until January 25, 1943.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-7\">Prior to the trial on the merits a stipulation of fact was entered into by the parties with reference to the issues raised by the complaint and answer. Two schedules attached thereto show the rents charged for the apartments on March 1, 1942, July 1, 1942, and November 1, 1942, and that the tenants were charged in November, 1942, for the occupancy of their apartments from $2 to $15 more monthly than they were charged for the same apartments in March, 1942.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-8\">It was further stipulated that on June 6, 1942, Stanley W. Taylor and Evelyn Flynn entered into an agreement whereby Taylor purported to sell the furniture and furnishings in the apartment house to Mrs. Flynn for $15,000. The agreement provided that the purchase price, of which only $1 was paid on the execution of the agreement, should be paid solely from charges to be thenceforth imposed on tenants of the apartments for the use of the furniture and furnishings. The utilization of the furniture and furnishings by Mrs. Flynn for any purpose was by the express terms of the agreement restricted to the apartment house. The furniture was not moved from the apartments as a result of the execution of the agreement but remained in the apartments subject to occasional replacements and the shifting of individual items from one apartment to another.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-10\">On July 31, 1942, the agreement was modified by a supplementary agreement which prohibited the removal of the furniture from the apartment house until such time as the purchase price should be fully paid and also provided that the agreement should not be assigned without the prior consent of Taylor. The supplementary agreement also contained the following: \u201cIt is further agreed that if due to governmental interference or for any other cause the purchaser [Evelyn Flynn] finds it impossible to carry out the terms of the purchase, that the return of the furniture and furnishings then in her legal possession to the sellers thereof, shall constitute full payment of any claim against her by the sellers on account of the contract of sale of June 6th, 1942, or as amended.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b881-11\">It was also stipulated as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b881-12\">\u201cOn June 27, 1942, Stanley W. Taylor caused to be installed in said apartment house a Bendix Automatic Laundry washing machine at a total cost of approximately $500.00 and this machine was, on or about said date, made available to the use of all tenants in the building. It was not annexed to any particular apartment unit in the building.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b881-13\">\u201cSince March 1, 1942, some 14 apartments in the building have been repainted and/or repapered more or less extensively and some items of furniture have been added or replaced in some of the apartments in the building.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b881-14\">\u201cExcept as stated in the preceding paragraphs, there has been no substantial change or improvement in the apartments in the building since March 1, 1942.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b881-15\">After trial on the merits, the court made findings of fact and conclusions of law in which it found the following facts among others:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b881-16\">\u201c * * * that each of said forty-eight (48) apartments was rented on March 1, 1942. Since July 1, 1942, defendants, and each of them, have demanded and received for the use and occupancy of forty-three (43) of said apartments as housing accommodations for periods subsequent to July 1, 1942, rents in excess of the respective rents for said apartments on March 1, 1942. None of said forty-eight (48) apartments was changed between March 1, 1942, and July 1, 1942, from unfurnished to fully furnished or from fully furnished to unfur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"830\">*830</page-number>nished or by a major capital improvement and no order adjusting the maximum rents for any of said apartments has been made by the Price Administrator. * * *.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b882-4\">\u201c * * * that on and since July 1, 1942, defendants, and each of them, have attempted to exclude and have excluded certain tenants of housing accommodations at 530 Larkin Street, San Francisco, California, from possession of such accommodations, although no ground for the eviction of said tenants existed, under Maximum Rent Regulation No. 28 * * *.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b882-5\">\u201c * * * that defendants, and each of them have rented and offered for rent, as housing accommodations, apartments at 530 Larkin Street, San Francisco, California, continuously since July 1, 1942, and defendants have not at any time filed any Registration Statements with the Price Administrator, specifying' the maximum rents for any of said apartments in accordance with Maximum Rent Regulation No. 28. Defendants have attempted to file certain Registration Statements with the Administrator, but none of said statements specified the maximum rent for any of said Apartments, and none of said statements was in the form prescribed by the Administrator and the employees of the Administrator refused to accept them for these reasons. Defendant did file certain Registration Statements with the Administrator on February 3, 1943, but none of said statements specified the maximum rent for any of said apartments and none of said statements was in the form prescribed by the Administrator.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b882-7\">Judgment was entered restraining the appellants from violating the Regulation, (a) by charging for any of the apartments a rental higher than .that charged therefor on March 1, 1942, or (b) by evicting or attempting to evict any of the tenants of the apartments except as permitted by the Regulation; and requiring appellants to file registration statements with the Office of Price Administration showing the maximum legal rents for the apartments as that charged therefor on March 1, 1942.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-12\">Prior to the trial on the merits, appellant, Stanley W. Taylor, on December 3 and December 4, 1942, served the tenants of the apartments with a notice to vacate on or before December 15, 1942.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-13\">On December 5, 1942, the Price Administrator filed a motion to adjudge said appellant in contempt of court, charging violation of the provisions of the temporary restraining order by the service of notices to vacate.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-14\">Appellant answered the motion, admitting the service, but denying that this constituted a violation of the temporary restraining order on the ground that he intended \u201cto withdraw his property from the market and not to offer any accommodations for rent in accordance with the rights granted him pursuant to Subsection (d) of Section 4 of the Emergency Price Control Act of 1942,\u201d which subsection provides as follows: \u201cNothing in this Act shall be construed to require any person to sell any commodity or to offer any accommodations for rent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b882-16\">Prior to the hearing on the motion, a stipulation of fact was entered into with reference to the issues raised thereby, showing that, in addition to the service of notices purporting to terminate existing tenancies and demanding possession of the apartments occupied by the tenants, appellant filed on December 8, 1942, with the Office of Price Administration a petition for a certificate authorizing the eviction of his tenants in compliance with \u00a7 1388.1806 (b) of the Regulation.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The petition was denied on January 21, 1943.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b882-17\">With reference to the contempt proceeding, the District Court found: \u201cThat <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"831\">*831</page-number>defendant, Stanley W. Taylor, together with the other defendants in the above-entitled action are, and at all times herein mentioned have been, the operators of an apartment house at 530 Larkin Street, San Francisco, California, renting apartments therein to tenants as housing accommodations; that on December 3 and December 4, 1942, defendant, Stanley W. Taylor, caused notice to be given to the tenants in forty (40) apartments in said building, requiring each tenant to vacate his apartment on or before December 15, 1942; that in said notices, defendant, Stanley W. Taylor, stated that the tenants were being required to vacate because he wished to withdraw the property from rental. In so doing Defendant Taylor was acting in had faith in that the reasons stated by him in said notices was not the real motive for the giving of said notices. Withdrawal of property from rental is not a ground for eviction of tenants under Maximum Rent Regulation No. 28 unless and until, on petition of the landlord, the Price Administrator issues a certificate authorizing the landlord to pursue his remedies for eviction in accordance with the requirements of the local law. Defendant, Stanley W. Taylor, had not at the time of serving said notice, and has not since, obtained any such certificate and no such certificate has been issued. Defendant has not formally withdrawn any of said notices.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-4\">\u201cThe Court further finds that defendant\u2019s claim that the Price Administrator does not come before the Court with clean hands is not true.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-5\">\u201cFrom the foregoing facts, the Court concludes that the giving of said notices constituted an attempt to exclude tenants from possession of housing accommodations in violation of said Temporary Order.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b883-6\">A fine of $500 was imposed on appellant, Stanley W. Taylor, but it was to be remitted if he proved to the satisfaction of the court that he had, during the sixty days following the entry of the order, fully and faithfully complied with the order of the court. This he did, and the fine was remitted on July 20, 1943.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-7\">The contentions of the appellants, for the most part, appear to be set forth in their opening brief under the caption \u201cQuestions Presented and Manner in Which They are Raised.\u201d We shall treat them in the order therein presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-9\">(1) May the trial court lawfully override the provisions and procedures set up in the Emergency Price Control Act of 1942, Maximum Rent Regulation 28, and Official interpretations issued by the Office of Price Administration for the guidance of its administrative branches and the public, adversely to appellants merely upon application or argument of an enforcement attorney for the appellee?</p>\n<p id=\"b883-10\">This question, say appellants, arises by reason of the fact that it appears from the record that the trial court has overridden these various provisions and procedures in the following manner:</p>\n<p id=\"b883-11\">(a) By its holding in both judgments appealed from that appellant Taylor may not withdraw his property from rental without the consent of appellee, the court has nullified the express prohibition of Section 4(d) of the Emergency Price Control Act of 1942 which states: \u201cNothing in this Act shall he construed to require any person to sell any commodity or to offer any accommodations for rent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b883-12\">The answer to this question is to be found in Taylor v. Bowles, Em.App., 145 F.2d 833, 834, and it is as follows: \u201c* * * except in a few specified situations, it is provided that the landlord must first obtain authorization from the Office of Price Administration before proceeding to evict a tenant. Originally, one of the situations in which evicton was permitted without prior administrative authorization was where \u2018the landlord seeks in good faith not to offer the housing accommodations for rent.\u2019 Evidently this worked out unsatisfactorily, for a tenant, served with such an eviction notice, would not know whether he was obliged to comply with it or not, in the absence of a conclusive determination of fact as to whether the landlord had the bona fide intention of withdrawing the accommodations from the rental market. The regulation was therefore amended, effective October 20, 1942, * * * so that a landlord wishing to withdraw his housing accommodations from the market could no longer proceed to evict his tenants without prior authorization by the Office of Price Administration. But the regulation as so amended does not conflict with Section 4(d) of the Act, for such a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"832\">*832</page-number>landlord upon a proper showing may obtain an eviction certificate from the Area Rent Director.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b884-4\">(b) By holding that none of the apartments in question had been changed by a major capital improvement, the court has overridden official O.P.A. Interpretation 5(a) (1)-I \u201cElements of Major Capital Improvement,\u201d previously known as Regional Rent Memorandum No. 19.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-6\">We refer the appellants to the holding of this court in Taylor v. United States, <em>9 </em>Cir., 1944, 142 F.2d 808. It is therein recited at pages 813, 814 as follows: \u201cThe only evidence of any substantial change in the apartment house during the periods involved in the information was the addition about June 27, 1942, of a Bendix washing machine for the general use of the apartment house tenants. The installation of this standard brand appliance necessitated an additional plumbing connection and an electrical outlet contacting -the wiring system which was already in the premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-7\">\u201cIn view of the Regulations to which we have adverted earlier in this opinion and of the ohly interpretation of .the Office of Price Administration that has any relevancy here, namely, Interpretation 5 (a) (1)-I, it would, we think, be repugnant to the purposes of the Emergency Price Control Act to conclude that the addition and installation of one electric washing machine, costing $300, in a large apartment house of forty-eight apartments, constitutes a major capital improvement to such housing facilities, particularly to the extent of increasing the total apartment house rentals between $300 and $400 monthly, and increasing the rent for an apartment $12.50 per month, as was done in one instance, at least.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Note that the Administrator\u2019s interpretation on this point reads as follows: \u201cA structural addition is a clear addition to the housing accommodations, such as the construction of an additional room or a new porch or the installation of plumbing, heating or electricity where such facilities did not previously exist. The addition need not necessarily be a part of the structure, but might also include a new garage or the installation of sidewalks. If \u25a0 the improvement has resulted in some added feature which did not exist prior to the change of a kind which would normally result in an increase in the rental value, then it would be a substantial change by a major capital improvement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b884-14\">(c) By rendering its judgment in the manner indicated in (b) above, the court has disregarded the provisions and procedures of Maximum Rent Regulation 28, Section 1388.1805(d) and Official O.P.A. Interpretation 4(d)-I, previously known as Interpretation No. 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-15\">We again refer the appellants to \u2022the case just cited at page 814 thereof: \u201c * * * This sub-section of the Regulation<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> has no relevance to the instant cause. The section merely states what may be done in those instances wherein a dispute arises between the landlord and tenant, or where there is doubt as to the actual rentals that should be charged for occupancy of the accommodations. Here there was no contention that there was any dispute between Taylor and\" his tenants relating to rents and whatever doubts may have arisen in the defendant\u2019s mind respecting rents that should have been charged for the apartments were, we think, effectually answered by the regulations.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b884-16\">(2) (a) Was the installation for the first time of automatic laundry equipment, and of hot and cold water lines and electric and sewer lines to serve the same, different from ordinary repair, replacement and maintenance ?</p>\n<p id=\"b884-17\">(b) Was such installation of automatic laundry equipment with plumbing, sewer and electric lines, a clear addition or a new facility added to the housing accommodations and not previously existing there?</p>\n<p id=\"b885-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"833\">*833</page-number>(c) Did such installation result in an added feature which would normally result in an increase in the rental value?</p>\n<p id=\"b885-5\">These questions are repetitious and, we think, are fully answered above.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-6\">(3) Could the extensive work of painting, papering, refinishing and refurnishitigs in some fourteen of appellants\u2019 apartments, taken into consideration with the existing circumstance of initially low rentals he expected to result in a comparatively high percentage adjustment in rentals?</p>\n<p id=\"b885-8\">This question, say appellants, arises because Interpretation 5(a) (1)-I, issued by the Office of Price Administration setting forth \u201cElements of Major Capital Improvement\u201d for the guidance of the public, as well as its own employees, sets forth in subdivision (3) thereof that under such circumstances complete rehabilitation of housing accommodations constitutes a major capital improvement.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-9\">The Administrator\u2019s interpretation on this point reads as follows: \u201cA complete rehabilitation is a general modernization and reconstruction such as would make the property attractive in a different rental range. Even though the individual items involved would, if considered separately, be normal repair, replacement and maintenance, if in .the aggregate, there is a substantial change in the character of the housing accommodations, there would be grounds for adjustment. The difference between a rehabilitation which is a major capital improvement and ordinary repairs is primarily a question of degree and extent. Only where the rehabilitation is so comprehensive that it could be expected to result <em>in </em>a comparatively high percentage adjustment in rental would it constitute a major capital improvement.\u201d Contrary to the contention of appellant, Stanley W. Taylor, the appellant, Evelyn Flynn, testified that of the fourteen apartments alleged to have been renovated, only seven were so renovated between March 1, 1942, and J-uly 1, 1942. Although the record shows that the amount of expenditures in this regard was approximately $2,000 during this period, plus some additional expenditures for renovations thereafter, the description of the work done shows that it consisted of ordinary maintenance and repairs. We do not find clear error in the trial court\u2019s finding that there had not been a complete rehabilitation of the apartments within the meaning of the foregoing definition.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-12\">(4) What are the maximum legal rents applicable to the property in question under Maximum Rent Regulation 28? (a) Are they the rents charged on March 1, 1942, or (b) are they the first rents charged after <em>the </em>changes and improvements made between March 1, 1942, and July 1, 1942?</p>\n<p id=\"b885-15\">Quite plainly the maximum legal rents applicable to the property in question under the Regulation are the rents charged on March 1, 1942, since it was found by the court that there were no major capital improvements such as would entitle appellants to additional rent. The first rents charged, if any, after the alleged changes and improvements made between March 1, 1942, and July 1, 1942, should, therefore, be disregarded. For general information regarding maximum rents chargeable, see Maximum Rent Regulation No. 28, Section 4, et seq., set forth in footnote 2 hereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-16\">(5) (a) May appellants be compelled to continue renting the property in question under the provisions of the Emergency Price Control Act of 1942?</p>\n<p id=\"b885-17\">(b) May the appellants or either of them as to their respective interests, be compelled to obtain the consent of appellee before withdrawing their property from rental, i.e., recovering possession thereof, when they no longer wish to rent such property ?</p>\n<p id=\"b885-18\">(c) Is Maximum Rent Regulation No. 28 valid under the Act insofar as it requires the appellants to obtain the consent of the appellee as a prerequisite to the withdrawal of housing accommodations from the rental market?</p>\n<p id=\"b885-19\">(d) Is the permanent injunction herein valid under the Act insofar as it enforces any provision of Maximum Rent Regulation No. 28 which requires that the consent of appellee be first obtained before the appellants may recover possession of their property and withdraw same from the rental market?</p>\n<p id=\"b885-20\">These questions are not susceptible of direct answers, as they assume inaccurate bases. The principles applying have been adequately treated in Taylor v. Bowles, Em. App., 145 F.2d 833, and in Taylor v. Brown, Em.App., 1943, 137 F.2d 654, in a manner generally contrary to appellants\u2019 contentions, and no further comment is needed.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-21\">We do not consider seriously appellants\u2019 use of the words \u201crecovering possession\u201d and \u201crecover possession,\u201d which appear in the above questions. See Bowles <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"834\">*834</page-number>v. Willingham, 321 U.S. 503, 517, 64 S.Ct. 641, 648: \u201c * * * We are not dealing here with a situation which involves a \u2018taking\u2019 of property. * * * \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b886-4\">There is nothing in the permanent injunction to prevent appellants\u2019 withdrawal of housing accommodations from the rental market. However, as has been pointed out, it is necessary to first obtain an eviction certificate from the Area Rent Director. It will be noted that at the time of the filing of the complaint and the entering of the temporary restraining order, appellants had shown no valid grounds under the Act for evicting or attempting to evict their tenants.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-5\">With reference to the contempt proceeding, the District Court found: \u201c * * * In so doing [causing notices to be given to tenants requiring them to vacate] Defendant Taylor was acting in bad faith in that the reasons stated by him in said notices was not the real motive for the giving of said notices. Withdrawal of property from rental is not a, ground for eviction of tenants under Maximum Rent Regulation No. 28 unless and until, on petition of the landlord, the Price Administrator issues a certificate authorizing the landlord to pursue his remedies for eviction in accordance with the requirements of the local law. Defendant, Stanley W. Taylor, had not at the time of serving said notice, and has not since, obtained any such 'Certificate and no such certificate has been issued. Defendant has not formally withdrawn any of said notices.\u201d \u201cFrom the foregoing facts, the Court concludes that the giving of\u2019 said notices constituted an' attempt to exclude tenants from possession of housing accommodations in violation of said Temporary Order.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b886-7\">Although the District Court predicated its conclusion on the above finding in part, and although it was subsequently decided by the Emergency Court of Appeals that \u201cbad faith\u201d is not necessarily to be considered when a landlord wishes to withdraw completely from the rental business, still, the \u2022 violation was effected by the giving of notices to vacate (or the attempt to evict), which was expressly prohibited by the temporary restraining order. Further, although the Emergency Court of Appeals also subsequently ruled that the Acting Area Rent Director should have issued a certificate authorizing the landlord to pursue his remedies in accordance with the local law, since the appellant, Stanley W. Taylor, wished to withdraw completely from the rental business, it will be noted that at the time of giving the notices to vacate, appellant had filed no petition with the Administrator, and, therefore, could not have received a certificate of authorization to proceed as he did. There can be no question but that appellant, Stanley W. Taylor, did violate the temporary restraining order and was, therefore, guilty of contempt.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-9\">(6) May the appellants or either of them without compensation due or paid to them be lawfully required to leave their respective property in the possession of tenants and to- be lawfully compelled to provide to such tenants the services and facilities agreed upon between said tenants and the appellants and at the same time be enjoined from collecting from said tenants either the amount the tenants agreed to pay, or in lieu thereof, just compensation for the facilities and services provided ?</p>\n<p id=\"b886-11\">This question, say appellants, arises by reason of the fact that appellants and each of them are required by the judgment and order herein to supply facilities and services at rentals wholly inadequate and below average rentals for similar facilities. Appellants contend that in this respect the judgment and order of the court in the permanent injunction violates the Fifth and Thirteenth Amendments to the Constitution of the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-12\">The facts of the instant case are practically the same as in Taylor v. United States, 9 Cir., 1944, 142 F.2d 808, in which this court said at page 813: \u201cThe claim that the furniture deal between the defendant and Mrs. Flynn transformed the housing accommodations involved in this appeal from furnished to unfurnished facilities is illusory.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-14\">\u201cThere was no detachment or separation in any way of the furniture or furnishings from the respective apartments by the sale agreement. As far as the appointments in the housing units were concerned, with the exception of the availability for \u25a0temporary use of an electric washer (and that always revocable at the option of the house management), the situation repecting the tenant was practically identical at all times from March 1, 1942, to the applicable dates in October and November, 1942, when the information charges the violations of the Regulations to have occurred.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b887-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"835\">*835</page-number>It will be noted that the additional \u201claundry service\u201d may be withdrawn at any time, but, clearly, the furniture under the so-called sales agreement cannot be removed (unless, of course, appellants withdraw completely from the rental market under the procedure indicated heretofore) ; and whatever problems may arise between the appellant-Taylors and Mrs. Flynn under the contract are their own concern. However, looking at the modification of the agreement, it would seem that such problems had been foreseen and provided for. See also Bowles v. Willingham, 321 U.S. 503, at pages 517-518, 64 S.Ct. at page 648: \u201c* * * There is no requirement that the apartments in question be used for purposes which bring them under the Act. Of course, price control, the same as other forms of regulation, may reduce the value of the property regulated. But * * * that does not mean that the regulation is unconstitutional. * * * \u201d We think the foregoing also answers adequately the appellants\u2019 next question, which is as follows: May the appellants, or either of them, be lawfully compelled under one order to supply the respective services and facilities required of each of them, and be enjoined from jointly collecting for such services and facilities more than a specified amount, which said amount being wholly inadequate as compensation for the facilities provided, applies to the appellants jointly, no provision being contained therein by which either of the appellants may determine what each may collect for the services and facilities provided by such respective appellants?</p>\n<p id=\"b887-6\">Attention is directed to the District Court\u2019s finding (and this supported by ample evidence) that \u201cnone of said forty-eight (48) apartments was changed between March 1, 1942, and July 1, 1942, from unfurnished to fully furnished or from fully furnished to unfurnished or by a major capital improvement and no order adjusting the maximum rents for any of said apartments has been made by the Price Administrator.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b887-7\">Appellants\u2019 last three questions are as follows: Is the construction placed upon the Act and Maximum Rent Regulation 28 in the judgment valid under the due process and just compensation clause of the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution? Is Maximum Rent Regulation 28 valid (a) under the Act, (b) under the Constitution of the United States ? Is the Emergency Price Control Act of <em>1942 </em>as applied to appellants by Maximum Rent Regulation No. 28 valid under the Fifth and Thirteenth Amendments to the Constitution?<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b887-10\">In Taylor v. United States, 9 Cir., 1944, 142 F.2d 808, at page 817 the court states as follows: \u201cThe constitutional basis of the Emergency Price Control Act of 1942 and Maximum Rent Regulation Number 28, \u2018born of the exigencies of war,\u2019 has been the subject of extensive and comprehensive litigation. The objections raised by appellant to this Act have been recently answered directly or in substance and adversely to appellant\u2019s cojltentions by the United States Supreme Court in Chester Bowles, as Administrator, etc. v. Mrs. Kate C. Willingham et al., [321 U.S. 503], 64 S.Ct. 641, and in Yakus, Petitioner, v. United States, and Rottenberg et al., Petitioners, v. United States [321 U.S. 414], 64 S.Ct. 660. There can be no longer any question as to the constitutional validity of either the Act or of any Regulation under attack in this appeal. Moreover, it should be noted that we are without jurisdiction to pass upon the validity of Rent Regulation Number 28 in view of the provisions of Section 204 of the Act, 50 U.S.C.A.Appendix, \u00a7 924.\u201d See also Taylor v. Brown, Em.App., 1943, 137 F.2d 654.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-13\">According to appellants\u2019 contention the district court, by its conclusion of law that it has no jurisdiction to consider the validity of Maximum Rent Regulation No. 28 issued by the Price Administrator under the Emergency Price <em>Control Act, 50 </em>U.S.C.A.Appendix \u00a7 901 et seq., has made an unlawful surrender of its power to consider the equities involved in and to apply its order to the circumstances of the particular case. The question has been decided adversely by the Supreme Court of the United States. In Lockerty v. Phillips, 1943, 319 U.S. 182, 63 S.Ct. 1019, 87 L.Ed. 1339, the Supreme Court, faced with the question \u201cwhether the jurisdiction of the district court below to enjoin the enforcement of price regulations prescribed by the Administrator under the Emergency Price Control Act of 1942, 56 Stat. 23, was validly withdrawn by \u00a7 204(d) of the Act\u201d (319 U.S. at page 184, 63 S.Ct. at page 1021, 87 L.Ed. 1339), gave as the answer that: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"836\">*836</page-number>\u201cIn the light of the explicit language of the Constitution and our decisions, it- is plain that Congress has power to provide that the equity jurisdiction to restrain enforcement of the Act, or of regulations promulgated under it, be restricted to the Emergency Court, and, upon review of its decisions, to this Court.\u201d 319 U.S. at page 188, 63 S.Ct. at page 1022, 87 L.Ed. 1339.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-4\">Insofar as the Thirteenth Amendment is concerned, all of the foregoing, having to do with constitutionality and validity, is equally applicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-5\">The above treatment of the issues of the main case disposes, as well, of the issues raised in regard to the appeal from the judgment of contempt.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b878-5\"> Section 2(b) of the Act authorizes the Price Administrator to prescribe by regulation the maximum rents which may be demanded or received, for housing accommodations within any defense-rental area (which by Section 302(d) of the Act is defined as meaning any \u201carea designated by the Administrator as an area where defense activities have resulted or threaten to result in an increase in the rents for housing accommodations inconsistent with the purposes of this Act.\u201d)</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b878-6\">Other pertinent parts of the Act are as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AMB\">\u00a7 2(d). \u201cWhenever in the judgment of the Administrator such action is necessary or proper in order to effectuate the purposes of this Act, he may, by regulation or order, regulate or prohibit speculative or manipulative practices (including practices relating to changes in form or quality) or hoarding, in connection with any commodity, and speculative or manipulative practices or renting or leasing practices (including practices relating to recovery of the possession) in connection with any defense-area housing accommodations, which in his judgment are equivalent to or are likely to result in price or rent increases, as the case may be, inconsistent with the purposes of this Act.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AdFF\">\u00a7 4(a). \u201cIt shall be unlawful, regardless of any contract, agreement, lease, or other obligation heretofore or hereafter entered into, for any person to sell or deliver any commodity, or in the course of trade or business to buy or receive any commodity, or to demand or receive any rent for any defense-area housing accommodations, or otherwise to do or omit to do any act, in violation of any regulation or order under section 2, or of any price schedule effective in accordance with the provisions of section 206, or of any regulation, order, or requirement under section 202(b) or section 205(f), or to offer, solicit, attempt, or agree to do any of the foregoing.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AIHd\">| 4(d). \u201cNothing in this Act shall be construed to require any.person to sell any commodity or to offer any accommodations for rent.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b878-10\">\u00a7 204(d). \u201cWithin thirty days after entry of a judgment or order, interlocutory or final, by the Emergency Court of Appeals, a petition for a writ of certiorari may be filed in the Supreme Court of the United States, and thereupon the judgment or order shall be subject to review by the Supreme Court in the same manner as a judgment of a circuit court of appeals as provided in section 240 of the Judicial Code, as amended (U.S.C. 1934 edition, Title 28, see. 347). The Supreme Court shall advance on the docket and expedite the disposition of all causes filed therein pursuant to this subsection.
