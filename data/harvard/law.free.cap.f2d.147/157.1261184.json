The policy had lapsed in the veteran\u2019s lifetime; but it had afterwards revived and matured, by reason of his total permanent disability, under section 305, World War Veterans\u2019 Act, 1924, as amended, 44 Stat 799, 38 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 516. Thereafter, in his lifetime, the statutory period of limitations elapsed and suit on the- policy was barred. Despite that fact, appellant argues that since she is an infant she is entitled to sue because section 19 of the World War Veterans\u2019 Act, 46 Stat. 992, 38 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 445, provides that \u201cInfants, insane persons, or persons under other legal disability, or persons rated as incompetent or insane by the Veterans\u2019 Administration shall have three years in which <em>to </em>bring suit after the removal of their disabilities.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b209-23\">We agree with the District Court that this suit cannot be maintained. The quoted provision in favor of infants and other incompetent persons does not mean that such persons may bring suit without having a right or claim to sue on. Nor does this provision confer any right upon such persons. Its only effect is to keep alive such rights as they have or acquire. Since suit on the policy was already barred when the veteran died, appellant acquired no right as beneficiary of the policy. \u201cThe legislation and the policy do not confer two rights. The beneficiary\u2019s interest in the policy is derivative from that of the veteran.\u201d United States v. Towery, 306 U.S. 324, 330, 59 S.Ct. 522, 524, 83 L.Ed. 678.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-24\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
