The court below held that no such liability on the part of the owner existed in view of the fact that it had procured from the War Shipping Administration a war risk insurance policy insuring those who were required by the order to be insured. Whether the procurement of such a policy is a compliance with the order is a question which is no longer of any practical importance, since it has been answered in the affirmative by a subsequent order or decision of the Board. We think, however, that it was correctly answered by the judge below for reasons adequately set forth in his opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-23\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
