The indictment alleged in effect that the conspiracy consisted of illegally demanding sums from taxpayers to each of whom it was represented that serious discrepancies existed between his books and his reported income, and that if he paid the demanded sum, a favorable report of his tax examination would be made.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-20\">There was evidence from which the jury could reasonably find the following: The conspiracy originated during July of 1946 when Miller, an accountant practicing in Catskill, New York, received a letter from Talanker, then an Internal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>Revenue Agent, stating that the income-tax returns of Spector Bros, (one of Miller\u2019s clients) were under examination. Talanker, on a visit to Miller, informed him that Spector had failed to include some $60,000 of income in its returns. Together, Miller and Talanker went to see Spector who, after discussing the deficiency, agreed to pay $3,000 for a favorable tax report. Several weeks later, Spector, refusing to pay any more than $1,500 as a bribe, gave that sum to Miller in Talanker\u2019s presence. As was agreed, Talanker put through a favorable report on the Spector case.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-4\">Sometime during 1947 Miller contacted the officers of the H. &amp; H. Transportation Lines, and showed them his notes indicating that the company\u2019s tax would be well over $10,000. He then stated that the whole thing could be cleared up for $5,000 cash. A few days later, Holmes, president of H. &amp; H. Transportation Lines, drove with Miller to 73 Winthrop Street in Albany, New York, where he paid $5,000 to an agent whom he could not positively identify at the trial. Tal-anker admitted that he lived at 73 Winthrop Street. Miller positively identified Talanker as the man to whom Holmes gave the money.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">Talanker left the Internal Revenue Department on June 30, 1947. In August 1947, O\u2019Brien, who died after sentence, became Chief of the Internal Revenue Department\u2019s office at Troy, New York.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-7\">Sometime during the latter part of 1948, Miller learned that Acme Glove Corporation, another of his clients, was about to undergo an examination of its corporate tax returns by an agent named Nudelman whom Talanker characterized as a \u201ctough agent.\u201d Miller contacted Talanker; Talanker promised to get in touch with O\u2019Brien and have the case assigned to another agent. Talanker and Miller then called on Snyder, Vice-President of Acme Glove Corporation, who agreed to pay $3,000 for a favorable examination. On October 30, 1948, when Miller and Talanker appeared with Agent Rourke, Snyder gave $3,000 to Miller in Talanker\u2019s presence. According to Miller, Talanker, Rourke and O\u2019Brien shared the $3,000 equally.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-10\">The tax returns of Oppenheimer, a Miller client, were assigned to Agent Zelnick for investigation in November of 1948. Miller cultivated Zelnick during the period November 1948 to March 1949, and finally, in March, persuaded Zelnick to \u201cfix the case.\u201d Miller then conferred with Oppenheimer and suggested to him that he offer Zelnick a bribe. The price agreed on was $1,000. After speaking to O\u2019Brien, Zelnick replaced pages 3 and 4 of the Oppenheimer return with new pages so that no additional tax was due.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-13\">The tax return of Orloff C. Barlow was \u201cfixed\u201d by Miller, Inkeles and O\u2019Brien in June of 1949. During that month, Miller approached Talanker on the subject of the tax return of Ernest Bell, for the purpose of having Talanker arrange to have another agent substituted for the one then investigating Bell\u2019s tax returns. During this period, Talanker introduced Miller to O'Brien; O\u2019Brien gave the file on Bell to Miller and instructed Miller to see Witt about it. Witt, under Talan-ker\u2019s direction, wrote out a report in Talanker\u2019s office. Miller, also under Talanker\u2019s direction, collected $1,000 from Bell. Talanker, Witt, Miller and O\u2019Brien shared the $1,000 paid by Bell.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-14\">During the summer of 1949, the return of the New Hotel Walters, Inc. (a Miller client) was assigned to Zelnick for investigation. Miller, Zelnick and O\u2019Brien shared the $2,000 paid by this taxpayer for a favorable examination. Inkeles received $1,000 for \u201cpreparing\u201d the return of Dr. Brown; this sum was divided among Miller, Inkeles and O\u2019Brien. Toward the end of 1949, Miller, Inkeles and O\u2019Brien shared the $2,000 received for \u201cfixing\u201d Dr. McQuade's return.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-15\">Van Loan, a client of Miller\u2019s, informed Miller, sometime during 1949, that his (Van Loan\u2019s) returns were under investigation in the Boston Office. Talanker told Miller to have the case transferred to the Troy Office. Later, Talanker informed Miller that Witt had been assigned to the case. After examin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>ing the taxpayer\u2019s 1947 return, Talanker ordered Witt to write a favorable report. Miller was instructed by Talanker to obtain $1,000 from the taxpayer. Miller, Witt, Talanker and O\u2019Brien shared this \u201cfee.\u201d Zelnick handled Van Loan\u2019s 1948 tax return, and, with Miller\u2019s help, obtained $800 for this \u201cfix.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\">The Levison return was examined by Witt in December of 1949. Miller, Witt and O\u2019Brien shared the $1,000 paid by Levison. In that same month, Miller and Zelnick collected $750 from Dr. Page.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-6\">From June of 1950, when Talanker, Witt, Inkeles, Zelnick, O\u2019Brien and their wives were all present at a party given by Miller, until January of 1951, five cases were \u201cfixed.\u201d Zelnick and Miller obtained $3,500 for \u201cfixing\u201d the Osborn return. Witt and Miller were paid $1,000 for \u201cfixing\u201d the Reis return. Miller and Zelnick \u201cfixed\u201d the Krauss and Ingalls returns. During this period, the 1948 Van Loan return was \u201cfixed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b627-7\">In January of 1951, Miller and Zelnick approached De Stefano Bros., although the De Stefano returns were not under investigation by any government agency. They succeeded in getting $3,000 from De Stefano Bros.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-8\">Both Miller and Zelnick testified for the prosecution in the present case. Talanker, Witt, Inkeles and O\u2019Brien were found guilty and sentenced. Rourke was acquitted. O\u2019Brien died subsequent to sentencing. Talanker, Witt and Inkeles have appealed from the judgment of conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-9\">1. Talanker contends that the proof shows not one conspiracy but a number of separate conspiracies to some of which he was not a party, and that, accordingly, we must reverse, pursuant to Kotteakos v. United States, 328 U.S. 750, 66 S.Ct. 1239, 90 L.Ed. 1557. We do not agree. There was evidence from which the jury could reasonably conclude that appellants, together with Miller, O\u2019Brien and Zelnick, formed a single \u201cring,\u201d the aim of which, known to all the conspirators, was, for a \u201cfee\u201d in each instance to \u201cfix\u201d real or</p>\n<p id=\"b627-11\">purported government claims based on defective income-tax returns and thus to defraud the United States; and that the operations of this single over-all conspiracy had a continuing character. It is not inconsistent with that conclusion that any particular \u201cfix\u201d was conducted by particular conspirators, or was not known to all the conspirators, or that the \u201cfee\u201d exacted in each \u201cfix\u201d was retained by those of the conspirators who participated in that \u201cfix.\u201d We think Blu-menthal v. United States, 332 U.S. 539, 558, 68 S.Ct. 248, 92 L.Ed. 154 governs here. See United States v. Ganey, 2 Cir., 187 F.2d 541.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-12\">2. Talanker alleges error in the reception of evidence of the Spector \u201cfix,\u201d in which he and Miller participated, because it occurred in 1946, before December of that year, the earliest date named in the indictment as to the existence of the conspiracy. We think this evidence properly admissible to show the way the conspiracy came into being and its <em>modus operandi </em>when it operated. See United States v. Dennis, 2 Cir., 183 F.2d 201; Heike v. United States, 227 U.S. 131, 33 S.Ct. 226, 57 L.Ed. 450.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-13\">Witt and Inkeles assert that, as against them, it was error to admit that evidence and also evidence of the Holmes \u201cfix,\u201d since both those transactions occurred without their knowledge and before the time when (according to the government) these defendants became conspirators. We think there was no error. This evidence tended to show the nature of the conspiracy in existence when these defendants joined it. United States v. Lekacos, 2 Cir., 151 F.2d 170, reversed on other grounds <em>sub nom. </em>Kotteakos v. United States, 328 U.S. 750, 66 S.Ct. 1239, 90 L.Ed. 1557; Lefco v. United States, 3 Cir., 74 F.2d 66.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-14\">3. We see no merit in Talanker\u2019s contention that, as to him, the judge erred in admitting the testimony of the bribing of Revenue Agent Zelnick, because the indictment did not specifically charge that Talanker conspired to corrupt Zelnick. Talanker, as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>a member of the single, comprehensive iconspiracy, was responsible for the acts of his co-conspirators which formed a <em>part of </em>their joint undertaking. United :States v. Kissel, 218 U.S. 601, 31 S.Ct. 124, 54 L.Ed. 1168.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-4\"><em>4. The </em>indictment named, as violated statutes, 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 4047(e)(4) and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371 (formerly 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 88). Under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 3748, the statute of limitations applicable to 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 4047 (e)(4) is six years; under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3282, the period applicable to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371 is three years. Talanker contends \u2014 and we assume arguendo\u2014 that 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 4047(e) (4) relates solely to crimes by revenue agents and does not extend to others even <em>if the </em>latter conspired with such agents. There is no proof of overt acts by the conspirators \u2022during that period of 1947 before Talanker ceased to be a revenue agent. Later, as an accountant in.private practice, he actively participated in the conspiracy in 1949 but not later. On these facts, ;he contends that, when the indictment was filed, on April 14, 1953, the three-year statute of limitations, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3282;-had run,</p>\n<p id=\"A5V\">We do not agree. There is \u00e1mple evidence that other members of the conspiracy committed overt acts as part of the conspiracy after April \u00cd4, 1950. Since Talanker failed to prove, and there is no evidence, that he ever affirmatively dissociated himself from the conspiracy, he must be deemed to have remained a party to it subsequent to April 14, 1950.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Accordingly, since he was liable as a private person under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371, the three-year statute had not run in his favor when the indictment was filed. As the indictment stated that he ceased to be a revenue agent in 1947, and cited 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371, we think it sufficiently charged him in his capacity as a private person.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"Auhs\">5. Witt and Inkeles complain that the prosecutor, in his opening statement to the jury, failed to state the character of the entire conspiracy, to read the indictment, and to refer to the names of government witnesses other than Miller and Zelnick. Not only in our opinion was this statement adequately informative,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> but none of the appellants objected to it at the time.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-16\">6. One of the jurors, during the trial, asked whether defendants who had not sought a bill of particulars might have done so and thereby obtained government evidence before the trial. We think the judge answered the question satisfactorily: he made it clear that no adverse inference should be drawn from the failure of defendants to seek such a bill.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-17\">7. During the trial, some of the jurors, with the judge\u2019s consent, put questions to witnesses and received answers. We think that a matter within the judge\u2019s discretion, like witness-questioning by the judge himself, as to which see United States v. Rosenberg, 2 Cir., 195 F.2d 583, 593-594.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-18\">8. One juror, during the trial, went to the library to see \u201cif he could find out about the ethics of a lawyer in taking cases.\u201d The prosecutor informed the judge and defense counsel of this fact. The judge sent for the juror who told the judge in chambers that \u201che could not find what he was looking for,\u201d that he had formed no opinion concerning the case, that he \u201chad not told any of his fellow jurors\u201d about his investigation, that nothing he had found \u201cwould affect him,\u201d and that \u201che would take the law from the court.\u201d Nevertheless, the prosecutor moved that this juror be ex-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>\u00abused and an alternate juror substituted. After consulting the defendants, defense counsel stated that they did not join in the prosecutor\u2019s motion, which the judge denied. It is incomprehensible that defendants should now assert error in this respect.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-5\">9. Nor do we agree with the defendants that the judge erroneously \u201cappealed\u201d to the jury to convict them in that part of his charge quoted in the footnote,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> which is substantially similar to the charge we approved in United States v. Hiss, 2 Cir., 185 F.2d 822.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b628-6\">. Hyde v. United States, 225 U.S. 347, 369, 32 S.Ct. 793, 56 L.Ed. 1114; Pinkerton v.

As noted below, neither he nor any of the other defendants sought a bill of particulars.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b628-22\">. Again it is pertinent that, as noted below, none of the defendants sought a bill of particulars.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b629-24\">. \u201cNow, ladies and gentlemen, if you find that the evidence respecting the defendants, or a defendant, is as consistent with innocence as with guilt, such defendant or defendants should be acquitted. If you find that the law has not been violated, you should not hesitate for any reason to find a verdict of acquittal. But, on the other hand, if you find that the law has been violated as charged, you should not hesitate because of sympathy or any other reason to render a verdiet of guilty, as a clear warning that a crime of this character may not be committed with impunity. The public is entitled to be assured of this.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
