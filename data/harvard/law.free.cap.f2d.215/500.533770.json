He appeals from an order of the District Court which granted the defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment and dismissed the complaint. Roth v. Brownell, D.C., 117 F.Supp. 362.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-17\">Plaintiff was removed from his position, as of the close of business July 31, 1953, by a letter dated June 29, 1953. He had been given no notice that his removal was contemplated. He was given no reasons. He had served in various attorney positions in the executive departments since 1938. He had become a member of the classified civil service April 15, 1943, under the Ramspeck Act, 54 Stat. 1211, 5 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 631a, 631b, and Executive Order 8743, April 23,1941, 6 F.R. 2117. All this is undisputed.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-18\">The Lloyd-LaFollette Act, 37 Stat. 555 (1912), as amended, 62 Stat. 354 (1948), 5 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 652(a), provides: \u201cNo person in the classified civil service of the United States shall be removed or suspended without pay therefrom except for such cause as will promote the efficiency of such service and for reasons given in writing. Any person whose removal or suspension without pay is sought shall (1) have notice of the same and of any charges preferred against him; (2) be furnished with a copy of such charges; (3) be allowed a reasonable time for filing a written answer to such charges, with affidavits; and (4) be furnished at the earliest practicable date with a written decision on such answer. * * * \u201d The question is whether the plaintiff could be removed legally, as he was actually, without compliance with these requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-19\">In 1947, when Roth had been in the classified civil service about four years, Executive Order No. 9830 [U.S.Code Cong.Service 1947, p. 1972], was issued. It provides that the \u201cpositions named in Schedules A and B * * * shall be ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>cepted from the competitive service. * * * \u201d [\u00a7 6.1] Schedule A includes attorneys. 12 F.R. 1259, 1263. It is agreed that \u201ccompetitive service\u201d and \u201cclassified civil service\u201d are equivalent terms. But Order 9830 was apparently intended, when it was issued, not to apply to attorneys who, like Roth, were already in the classified civil service. Until the District Court decided this case, the Civil Service Commission interpreted Order 9830 as not applying' to these attorneys.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">The defendants assume, without directly asserting, that the plaintiff was not \u201cremoved\u201d from the classified civil service in 1947 when Order 9830 \u201cexcepted\u201d such \u201cpositions\u201d as his from that service. But despite that assumption, the defendants say that by reason of Order 9830 the plaintiff ceased to be \u201cin the classified civil service\u201d, with the result that he was not \u201cremoved\u201d from it in 1953 either, and that there was therefore no need to comply with the Lloyd-LaFollette Act in removing him from the position he held in 1953. This is a paradox. Roth was once' in the classified civil service, did not leave it voluntarily, and is now out of it. It follows that he was removed from it. We think he was removed from it in 1953. But whether he was removed from it in 1947 or in 1953 there was no compliance with the Lloyd-LaFollette Act. Neither the formula of \u201cexcepting\u201d the kind of position a person holds, nor any other formula, can obviate the requirement of the Lloyd-LaFollette Act that \u201cNo person in the classified civil service of the United States shall be removed * * * therefrom\u201d without notice and reasons given in writing. The power of Congress thus to limit the President\u2019s otherwise plenary control over appointments and removala is clear.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-7\">It is immaterial here that the-President has long been \u201cauthorized <em>to </em>prescribe such regulations for the <em>admission </em>of persons into the civil service of' the United States as may best promote-the efficiency thereof * * 16 Stat.. 495, R.S. \u00a7 1753, 5 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 631. (Emphasis added.) Complete control over-admissions does not obviate the removal requirements of the Lloyd-LaFollette-Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-9\">In our opinion the plaintiff is entitled; to a summary judgment that his removal, from his position was not in accordance-with law and that he should be restored to the position.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-10\">Reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
