We think the proof was ample that appellant aided and abetted those who took the automobile and the property, and as an aider and abettor he was liable as a principal.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The evidence showed that the planning and the taking were within the District of Columbia and that the appellant, in the District of Columbia, participated in various acts which were part, both preliminarily and subsequently, of the criminal venture. We find no error which affected the substantial rights of the appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-21\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b79-22\">. 37 Stat. 656 (1913), D.C.Code, \u00a7 22-2204 (1951).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b79-24\">. 31 Stat. 1324 (1901), 50 Stat. 628 (1937), D.C.Code, \u00a7 22-2201 (1951).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"AGm\">. 31.
