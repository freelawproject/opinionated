They appeal from their conviction contending, <em>inter alia, </em>that the court erroneously admitted in evidence certain articles seized by the arresting officers at the time of arrest. A motion to suppress this evidence, filed pursuant to Rule 41 (e), Fed.R.Crim.Proc., 18 U.S.C., was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-13\">Whether the crime charged is a misdemeanor because so designated by \u00a7 22-1506, supra, or is a felony because punishable by imprisonment for more than one year, see 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1 (1952), we think the evidence as to what the officers saw transpiring justified them in making the arrest without a warrant. The articles seized as an incident to the valid arrest were accordingly not inadmissible in evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-15\">In other respects as well the appellants were fairly tried and convicted.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-16\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
