The federal court ordered that he be returned to the custody of the state authorities for continuation of his life sentence. In 1952 on direction of the Attorney General he was transferred from the Kentucky State Penitentiary to the United States Penitentiary at Terre Haute, Indiana, and subsequently transferred to the penitentiary at Alcatraz. A detainer has been placed upon him by the Kentucky authorities.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-24\">Appellant contends that his transfer from the state to the federal authorities, despite the sentencing court\u2019s order that he be returned to his Kentucky confinement, was unlawful and that he is therefore entitled to be discharged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>from custody. The contention is without substance. It is the province of the Attorney General, not of the court, to determine the place of confinement. Mahoney v. Johnston, 9 Cir., 144 F.2d 663; Banghart v. Swope, 9 Cir., 175 F.2d 442.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-5\">The order below is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
