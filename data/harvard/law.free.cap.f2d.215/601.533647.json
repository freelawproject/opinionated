Plaintiff, a night watchman in a cotton warehouse, also sought liquidated damages and attorney\u2019s fees. The case was submitted for final judgment upon the pleadings and a stipulation of the facts. The district judge, after allowing certain partial defenses, entered judgment for the plaintiff in the amount of $142 and attorney\u2019s fees. From this judgment the defendant appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-9\">Among the defenses relied upon by the defendant was a claim of complete exemption under 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 213(a) (10), in that the definition of \u201carea of production (as defined by the Administrator)\u201d was invalid. The district judge, although allowing the partial exemption for seasonal employment,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> held the Administrator\u2019s definition valid and concluded that the defendant was not entitled to the complete exemption under section 213(a)(10). It is upon this alleged error of the district judge that we think the case is to be decided.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-10\">The stipulations disclose that the plaintiff was employed in a cotton warehouse located in a town of 6,309 population (in excess of 2,500 population) in an area having a high volume of cotton production; that over 95% of all cotton received in the warehouse each month was grown within twenty airline miles of the warehouse; that nearly all cotton stored in the warehouse was owned by the farmers who grew it; that more than 200 bales of cotton are grown each year within the city limits of the town.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-12\">Section 213(a) (10) of 29 U.S.C.A. reads: \u201cThe provisions of sections 206 and 207 of this title <em>shall not apply </em>with respect to * * * any individual employed <em>within the area of production </em>(as defined by the Administrator), engaged in * * * storing * * * in their raw or natural state * * * of agricultural or horticultural commodities for market * * (Emphasis ours.)</p>\n<p id=\"b646-13\">The applicable provisions of the definitive regulation promulgated by the Administrator under this section are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-14\">\u201c(a) An individual shall be regarded as employed in the \u2018area of production\u2019 within the meaning of Section 13(a) (10) of the Fair Labor Standards Act in * * * storing * * * in their raw or natural state * * * of agricultural or horticultural commodities for market * * *:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-16\">\u201c(1) If the establishment where he is employed is located in the open country or in a rural community and 95 percent of the commodities on which such operations are performed by the establishment come from normal rural sources of supply located not more than the following air line distances from the establishment: ******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-17\">\u201c(iii) With respect to the storing of cotton * * * 20 miles;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-18\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-19\">\u201c(b) For the purposes of this section:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-20\">\u201c(1) \u2018Open country or rural community\u2019 shall not include any city, town or urban place of 2,500 or greater population * * 29 C.F.R. 536.2.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b646-21\">The specific question with which we are confronted is the validity of the administrative regulation excluding from the area of production any establish<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>ment located in towns in excess of 2,500 population.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-5\">In Addison v. Holly Hill Fruit Products, Inc., 322 U.S. 607, at page 619, 64 S.Ct. 1215, at page 1222, 88 L.Ed. 1488, the court, excluding from consideration the 2,500 population test, but holding invalid the administrator\u2019s exclusion of establishments having in excess of seven employees, stated, \u201cConcluding, then, that when Congress granted exemptions for workers within the \u2018area of production (as defined by the Administrator)\u2019 it restricted the Administrator to the drawing of geographic lines, even though he may take into account all relevant economic factors in the choice of areas open to him, the regulations which made discriminations within the area defined by applying the exemption only to plants with less than seven employees are <em>ultra vires.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b647-6\">The statute by giving to the Administrator the authority and duty to define the \u201carea of production\u201d contemplates that the area will be delimited; but here we must determine whether, after having fixed the boundaries of the area of production, the administrator may proceed further and exclude from the exemption establishments located within the geographic boundaries because of the existence of other conditions. We do not think so. When reasonable geographic lines of the area of production have been established, the act makes the exemption effective within that area. Because of the close analogy between the regulation which limited the number of employees in a plant, declared invalid in the Holly Hill case, and the regulation with which we are concerned, which excludes establishments located within a town having 2,500 or more population, we hold the latter definition invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-7\">Though this particular point has not previously come before the Fifth Circuit, the thinking of this court was set forth in the case of Jenkins v. Durkin, 208 F.2d 941. In that case, this court agreed, and we now hold, that said definition is invalid. See dissenting opinion of Judge Pickett of the Tenth Circuit in Tobin v. Traders Compress Co., 199 F.2d 8, at page 11.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b647-9\">As stated by Mr. Justice Frankfurter in the Holly Hill case, supra: \u201cBut that leaves the difficult problem of the proper disposition of the case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b647-10\">In the Holly Hill case, the court said, in the last paragraph on page 618 of 322 U.S., on page 1221 of 64 S.Ct.: \u201cWe agree therefore with the Circuit Court of Appeals in holding invalid the limitations as to the number of employees within a defined area. But we cannot follow that Court in deleting this part of the administrative regulation and, by applying what remains of the definition, exempting Holly Hill\u2019s employees from the requirements of the Act. Since the provision as to the number of employees was not authorized, the entire definition of which that limitation was a part must fall. We can hardly assume that the Administrator would have defined \u2018area of production\u2019 merely by deleting the employee provision, had he known of its invalidity. It would be the sheerest guesswork to believe that elimination of an important factor in the Administrator\u2019s equation would have left his equation unaffected even if he did not here insist upon its importance. It is not for us to write a definition. That is the Administrator\u2019s duty.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b647-11\">It is our opinion based upon Mr. Justice Frankfurter\u2019s reasoning in the Holly Hill case, that although the Administrator\u2019s definition of \u201carea of production\u201d is invalid because of the 2,500 population feature, we are not authorized to rewrite the definition, eliminating that factor. This necessitates this case being remanded to the district court with instructions to hold it until the Administrator, by making a valid determination of the area with all deliberate speed, acts within the authority given him by Congress. Chief Judge Rice of the Eastern <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>District of Oklahoma quite clearly expressed this line of reasoning in the case of Messenger v. Traders Compress Co., 107 F.Supp. 354,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> in his conclusion of law No. 5, page 360.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-4\">The judgment appealed from is reversed, and the cause remanded to the district court for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-5\">Reversed and Remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-6\">Judge Strum sat during the oral argument of this case, but died before the opinion was written.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b646-22\">. 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 207 (b) (3).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b647-12\">.
