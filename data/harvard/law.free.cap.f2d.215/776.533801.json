Prior thereto in December, 1950, they had executed and recorded in the office of the County Recorder of Los Angeles County a Declaration of Homestead which read in its entirety as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b820-20\">\u201cDeclaration of Homestead</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"aql-dedup-0\">\u201c(By Head of Family)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b820-21\">\u201cKnow All Men by These Presents:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b820-22\">\u201cThat I, Robert L.

Their main objection to the instrument was that Section 1263 of the California Civil Code provides, inter alia, that a declaration of homestead must contain \u201can estimate of their [the premises] actual cash value\u201d and, so the trustee and referee said, this requirement had not been met; therefore, no valid declaration had been made.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-23\">The bankruptcy schedules reported the real estate, asserted its exemption under California law and listed the property as having no value \u201cabove the encumbrances and homestead.\u201d Nowhere in the record before this court is there any indication that the debtors have ever officially stated what the actual value is of the property itself. It does appear that two trust deeds (i. e., the encumbrances) on the property secured amounts which total about $12,800.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-24\">On review in the district court, the referee was reversed, 114 F.Supp. 301, the district court construing the document to mean that the homestead declaration could affect only so much of the property\u2019s value as was unencumbered, and it was logical to assume herein that the declarants meant to say in their declaration, when they left the value of the property blank, that in their opinion the property had no value or no value above encumbrances.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-25\">The argument is ingenious, but we cannot accept it. As we see it, in logic, the argument turns upon itself and destroys itself in the mere statement. For if one must have value to declare a homestead, then how could there be a homestead of no value ? In our view, the Stot-lers, being face up against the necessity of stating the value of their property in the declaration, failed to state that the property had value or no value and, if It had value, what the value was.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-26\">Construing, as we do, that the claimants failed to declare the value of the homestead, then we come to the legal effect of the failure.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"778\">*778</page-number>Both parties cite many California homestead cases. Many of these cases tend toward a liberal construction of the California exemption statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-3\">Although homestead exemptions are a creature of statute and not of common law, we are bound to and we do accept the idea that the statute should not be too strictly construed. But where the homestead requires as a condition of its existence the performing of certain acts and some of them have not been performed, we find no California case that would justify us in reading statutory requirements out of the statute. As we have construed the declaration, the bankrupts did little more than say in writing, \u201cWe want a homestead.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b822-4\">We think we are compelled to deny the homestead on the basis of the underlying reasoning of the following California cases: Rich v. Ervin, 86 Cal.App. 2d 386, 194 P.2d 809; Crenshaw v. Smith, 74 Cal.App.2d 255, 168 P.2d 752; Schuler-Knox Co. v. Smith, 62 Cal.App. 2d 86, 144 P.2d 47; Reid v. EnglehartDavidson Co., 126 Cal. 527, 58 P. 1063; Ames V. Eldred, 55 Cal. 136; Ashley v. Olmstead, 54 Cal. 616.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-5\">It may be said that the California statute serves no useful purpose in requiring that the value of a homestead should be set forth in a declaration. Maybe the United States statutes should allow a homestead of decent value. Those are legislative matters.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-6\">The circumstances of the execution of the homestead on the standard California Wolcott form, we have no way of knowing. Edgar J. Bramble appears thereon as the notary who executed the jurat. If the bankrupts composed the declaration themselves and Mr. Bramble acted only in his proper function as a notary, then the Stotlers must charge their loss to their own failure to carry out the plain suggestions of the form or to seek advice from a competent lawyer. There is no indication that Notary Bramble is a member of the Calfornia bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-7\">The judgment of the district court is reversed with instructions to affirm the referee in denying the claim of the bankrupts for exemption of the real estate herein involved.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b821-19\">.
