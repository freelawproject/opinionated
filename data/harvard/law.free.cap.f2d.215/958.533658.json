The Government, in answer, makes two points. The first is that the district court had no jurisdiction to grant the writ since the appellant\u2019s conviction had been affirmed by this court, 204 F.2d 507. Without considering the question of jurisdiction of the district court we are clearly of the opinion that the appellant has presented no facts on which he is entitled to relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-28\">The decision of the district court will, therefore, be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
