Appellee\u2019s mark \u201cJoy\u201d was registered in 1950.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-11\">It is alleged in appellee\u2019s petition for cancellation that the goods of the parties are of the same descriptive properties and that the use of appellant\u2019s mark \u201cJoy Suds\u201d on its goods is such as to cause confusion and deception as to the origin of the goods.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-13\">Appellant in its answer has generally denied the material allegations of the petition for cancellation and, as an affirmative defense, has alleged that appel-lee, by reason of laches, is estopped to contest appellant\u2019s right of registration of its mark \u201cJoy Suds.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b327-14\">Both parties have filed testimony and briefs and were represented at the oral hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-15\">The Examiner of Interferences was of the opinion that there are substantial differences between the marks \u201cJoy Suds\u201d and \u201cLa Joie De Jean Patou\u201d and between the toilet preparations to which the marks \u201cJoy Suds\u201d and \u201cJoy\u201d are respectively applied, and that these differences between the marks and the goods involved were controlling on the question of likelihood of confusion when considered in connection with appellant\u2019s defense of laches. He also was of the opinion that since appellant\u2019s registration of its mark \u201cJoy Suds\u201d under the Trade-Mark Act of 1905 has been a matter of public record since its publication in the Official Gazette appellee has been chargeable with constructive notice thereof since that date and that appel-lee\u2019s delay of more than eight years in bringing this proceeding, during which time appellant has built up a valuable good will in connection with its mark, constitutes such laches as to estop appel-lee from now asserting that it would be injured by the continued existence of appellant\u2019s registration.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-16\">The Examiner-in-Chief agreed with the Examiner of Interferences that there is little or no likelihood of confusion between appellee\u2019s registration \u201cLa Joie De Jean Patou\u201d and \u201cJoy Suds\u201d but was of the opinion that appellee\u2019s mark \u201cJoy\u201d as applied to perfumes, and appellant\u2019s mark \u201cJoy Suds\u201d as applied to a preparation for use in the bath, are closely similar and would be very likely to cause confusion if manufacturers of perfumes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>also make and distribute bath preparation under the same name as their perfumes and he held that there is a distinct likelihood of confusion between the mark \u201cJoy\u201d and \u201cJoy Suds\u201d when applied to-the goods of the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-4\">The Examiner-in-Chief was also of the opinion that the doctrine of laches, based upon constructive notice, should not be applied in the instant case-unless appellant shows \u201cincreased sales, profits, investment, etc., up to the present in order to establish that respondent would be in a worse position now, if the registration were cancelled, than he would have been if the cancellation proceedings were earlier instituted.\u201d Citing Willson v. Graphol Products Co., Inc., 188 F.2d 498, 38 C.C.P.A., Patents, 1030; Lightnin Chemical Co. v. Royal Home Products, Inc., 197 F.2d 668, 39 C.C.P.A., Patents, 1031; Continental Distilling Corporation v. Bohemian Distributing Co., 95 U.S. P.Q. 160; Krantz Brewing Corporation v. Henry Kelly Importing &amp; Distributing Co., Inc., 96 U.S.P.Q. 219.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">The testimony discloses that both parties refused to state how much business they did or how much they expended for advertising. Appellant\u2019s testimony was to the effect that its sales were in <em>excess </em>of $25,000 per year beginning in 1939 and that it expended in <em>excess </em>of $12,000 per year for advertising in newspapers, pamphlets, radio and television. Also that in 1939 the Hylo Company, Inc., was incorporated for $1,000. In 1942 the capital was increased to $10,000 and further increased at different times to its present capital of $100,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-6\">The testimony of Mr. Smolowe, Executive Vice-President of appellee, discloses that he did not know of appellant\u2019s \u201cJoy Suds\u201d until it was brought to his attention by his attorney about eight months before the taking of testimony in the instant case. Therefore appellee can only be charged with constructive notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-7\">We think the case of Willson v. Graphol, supra, is controlling on the issue of laches. In that case we held that publication of the mark involved in . the Official Gazette of the Patent Office &gt; is-constructive notice and that a party may not sit idly by for ten years after such publication and then move to have the mark so published cancelled.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-9\">In the case at bar appellant\u2019s mark \u201cJoy Suds,\u201d was duly registered and published in the Official Gazette in 1941, since which time it has been continuously' used.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-10\">Appellee brought this proceeding over eight years after appellant\u2019s mark \u201cJoy Suds\u201d was registered and published in the Official Gazette. Under the circumstances set forth above we think this delay of more than eight years in bringing this proceeding, during which time appellant continuously used its said mark and has built up a valuable good will in connection with the mark constitutes such laches as to estop appellee from now asserting that it would be injured by the continued existence and use of the mark \u201cJoy Suds.\u201d\"</p>\n<p id=\"b328-11\">There has been some question raised as to appellant\u2019s right to the mark \u201cJoy Suds.\u201d However, the record shows that the original Hylo Company, Inc., which was issued the mark \u201cJoy Suds\u201d' was dissolved and its business taken over by a partnership composed of the persons who owned all of the stock in that corporation. Later, the partnership formed a new corporation, Hylo Company, Inc., in which they owned all of the stock. Each of the business enterprises maintained the use of the mark \u201cJoy Suds.\u201d On-these stated facts, we agree with the holding of the Examiner of Interferences that \u201cthe present Hylo Company, Inc., is the present successor to the business, and good will associated therewith, formerly conducted by the original registrant, and, therefore, it must be regarded as the owner of the mark \u2018Joy Suds,\u2019 used therein, MacWilliam v. President Suspender Co., 46 App.D.C. 45, 1917 C.D. 179.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b328-12\">We have carefully considered all of the arguments of the parties and cited cases, but deem it unnecessary to further <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>discuss them. For the reasons hereinbe-fore stated, the decision of the Examiner-in-Chief is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">Reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-6\">O\u2019CONNELL and COLE, Judges, dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-7\">JACKSON, Judge, retired, sat for GARRETT, Chief Judge.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
