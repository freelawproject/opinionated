Aronson, 124 F.Supp. 453.</p>\n<p id=\"b998-22\">During the argument in this court it was disclosed that the Supreme Court of Montana now has under submission a cause involving among others, the same question which appellant sought to present in the court below. As appellant, who is only a prospective bidder for a state lease, must lean heavily upon the Declaratory Judgments Act, 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 2201, 2202, the fact that the merits of appellant\u2019s complaint have been argued in the state court is an additional reason for the district court\u2019s denial of relief. \u201cThe extent to which the declaratory judgment procedure may be used in the federal courts to control state action lies in the sound discretion of the Court.\u201d Alabama State Federation of Labor v. McAdory, 325 U.S. 450, 471, 65 S.Ct. 1384, 1394, 89 L.Ed. 1725. Cf. Great Lakes Dredge &amp; Dock Co. v. Huffman, 319 U.S. 293, 298, 300, 63 S.Ct. 1070, 87 L.Ed. 1407; Kerotest Mfg. Co. v.
