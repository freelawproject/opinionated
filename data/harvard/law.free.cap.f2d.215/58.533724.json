The Commissioner mailed notice of deficiency assessment for that year in the amount of $6,461.78 on March 27, 1951, which was more than three years, but less than five years, after the return was filed. The amount of the deficiency assessment is admitted to be correct. The taxpayer petitions for review of the Tax Court\u2019s decision, which sustained the assessment as timely made within the five-year limitation period provided by \u00a7 275(c) of the Internal Revenue Code, 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 275(c), on the ground that the taxpayer had omitted from his return an amount of \u201cgross income\u201d properly includible therein which was in excess of 25 per cent of the amount of gross income \u201cstated\u201d in his return. The only question presented on this review is whether the three-year period of limitation provided in \u00a7 275(a) of the Internal Revenue Code for the assessment of a deficiency, or the five-year period of limitation for the assessment provided in \u00a7 275(c) was applicable. Section 275(a) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-14\">\u201cThe amount of income taxes imposed by this chapter shall be assessed within three years after the return was filed, and no proceeding in court without assessment for the collection of such taxes shall be begun after the expiration of such period.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b103-15\">Section 275(c) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-16\">\u201cIf the taxpayer omits from gross income an amount properly includible therein which is in excess of 25 per centum of the amount of gross income stated in the return, the tax may be assessed, or a proceeding in court for the collection of such tax may be begun without assessment, at any time within 5 years after the return was filed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b103-17\">The taxpayer contends that the assessment and collection of the agreed deficiency of $6,461.78 was barred by the three-year limitation provided in \u00a7 275(a). On the other hand, the Commissioner contends that the assessment was timely under the five-year limitation provided in \u00a7 275(c). To answer this question as to whether the three-year or the five-year period of limitation was applicable, we must first determine whether the taxpayer in his 1945 return omitted from his <em>statement of gross income </em>an amount properly includible therein which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>was in excess of 25 per cent of the amount \u201cstated.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b104-4\">The material facts are stipulated. In his 1945 return the taxpayer reported his \u201coccupation\u201d and \u201cnature of business\u201d as \u201cTransfer &amp; Storage Grocery &amp; Trailers,\u201d and stated that he was self-employed. Under item 4 \u2014 \u2019\u201cIf you received any other income, give details on page 2 and enter the total here\u201d \u2014 the taxpayer stated the sum of $2,640.47, which he had shown in Schedule C on page 2 as the \u201cnet profit\u201d from his business. He entered no amount under item 2 representing wages, salaries, and other compensation, or under item 3 representing dividends and interest, or under item 5 representing the total amount of items 2, 3, and 4. In \u201cSchedule C. \u2014 Profit (or Loss) from Business or Profession,\u201d he made the following statement relative to his gross and net profit:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-5\">\u201cl.

However, he contends that the Commissioner should have revised his entire tax return and rearranged the figures so as to show a \u201cgross income\u201d greatly in excess of the $7,000.47 he had stated. He asks in effect that his return be revised so as to show a \u201cgross income\u201d of $46,677.82 or, in the alternative, $35,-063.75, computed on the following basis:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b105-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>\u201cProposed Alternate</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b105-4\">\u201cGross sales................. $ 67,105.95 $ 67,105.95</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b105-5\">\u201cCost of goods sold: Beginning inventory..... 2,100.00 2,100.00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b105-7\">Purchases ................ 19,849.41 19,849.41</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b105-8\">Ending inventory........

The Commissioner contends that the sum of $7,000.47 reported in the return as gross profit was actually the taxpayer\u2019s <em>statement </em>of his \u201cgross income,\u201d and that as the unreported net capital gain of $4,556.20 was in excess of 25 per cent of his statement of gross income, the deficiency assessment was timely made within the five-year limitation. Section 22(a) of the Code, 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 22(a), provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AgC\">\u201cGeneral definition. \u2018Gross income\u2019 includes gains, profits, and income derived from salaries, wages, or compensation for personal service * * *, of whatever kind and in whatever form paid, or from professions, vocations, trades, businesses, commerce, or sales, or dealings in property, whether real or personal, growing out of the ownership or use of or interest in such property; also from interest, rent, dividends, securities, or the transaction of any business carried on for gain or profit, or gains or profits and income derived from any source whatever.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b105-18\">The taxpayer\u2019s statement that his occupation or business was \u201cTransfer &amp; Storage Grocery &amp; Trailers,\u201d brings him within the classification of a merchandising business. Section 29.22(a)-5 of Treasury Eegulations III promulgated under the Internal Eevenue Code provides :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b105-19\"><em>\u201cGross income from business. </em>In the case of a manufacturing, merchandising, or mining business, \u2018gross income\u2019 means the total sales, less the cost of goods sold, plus any income from investments and from incidental or outside operations or sources. In determining the gross income subtractions should not he made for depreciation, depletion, selling expenses, or losses, or for items not ordinarily used in computing the cost of goods sold.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b105-20\">Although tax report form 1040 used by the taxpayer does not contain the term \u201cgross income,\u201d it is nevertheless clear that the statement in his return of a gross profit of $7,000.47 was actually his statement of his \u201cgross income\u201d within the meaning of that term as used in \u00a7 275(c). There was no obligation on the Commissioner to revise or reconstruct the return, and the taxpayer is bound by that statement of his gross income. Furthermore, in determining the deficiency assessment of $6,461.78 the Commissioner considered not only the unreported net capital gain item of $4,556.20 but also the nondeductible and additional income items of: alimony settlement, $11,200; legal expense, $762.60; and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>inventory adjustment $254.92. As the taxpayer admits the deficiency assessment is correct, it could be argued with considerable force that these nonallowable deductions and additional items aggregating $12,217.52 were also omitted by the taxpayer in computing his statement of \u201cgross income\u201d in his return. In Corrigan v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 6 Cir., 155 F.2d 164 at page 166, this court, in affirming the Tax Court\u2019s holding that the five-year limitation provided in \u00a7 275(c) was applicable, said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b106-4\">\u201cThe taxpayer urges that the five-year limitation does not govern, upon the ground that the proposed increases in her income taxes result from the disallowance of deductions from gross income and not from omissions from gross income. The income of the taxpayer was increased by the amount of the deductions taken which was in excess of twenty-five per cent of the amount of gross income stated in the return. Since she did not report this amount in her return, she omitted it from gross income. The fact that the trustee in its return set out the entire trust income and deductions claimed does not relieve the taxpayer from her obligation to include these amounts in gross income. The omission falls squarely within the terms of \u00a7 275(c) and the five-year limitation applies.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b106-5\">Section 275(c) provides that if the taxpayer omits from gross income an .amount properly includible which is in excess of 25 per cent of the <em>amount of gross income stated, </em>the deficiency tax may be assessed at any time within five .years. Therefore, the amount of $7,000.-47 which the taxpayer <em>stated </em>in his return is the controlling figure. There was no obligation on the Commissioner to -change that <em>statement of gross income </em>by a reaudit or revision of the return, -even though a complete reaudit or revision might have changed the figure of .-gross income. In O\u2019Bryan v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 9 Cir., 148 F.2d 456, 459, 460, the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b106-7\">\u201cThe mere appearance of the total amount of gross income somewhere on the face of an income tax return is not sufficient to prevent an omission within the terms of \u00a7 275(c). The government is not required to search carefully throughout a tax return to ascertain some fact which will put it on notice of error. It is apparent from the pertinent legislative history that care and good faith on the part of a taxpayer will not prevent the applicability of subsection (c). Ewald v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 6 Cir., 1944, 141 F.2d 750, 753. To satisfy the terms of the section, the figure which represents gross income and from which net income is derived must not be understated by an amount in excess of 25 per cent of the figure. In the instant case gross income was shown as only half the correct amount. Therefore, the limitation period for assessing deficiencies was determined by \u00a7 275(c).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b106-9\">In Ewald v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 6 Cir., 141 F.2d 750 at page 753, this court in affirming the decision of the Tax Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b106-10\">\u201cIt is clear that it was the congressional purpose to fix a longer period of limitation regardless of the intention of the taxpayer where the sum omitted from gross income was 25 percent or more. As we view it the act is so plain that it can have but one interpretation. The word \u2018omits\u2019 is in no way qualified by the context of the Revenue Act. If it had been the intention of the framers of the act to qualify it so as to apply only to negligent omission, the word \u2018negligently\u2019 easily could have been inserted. Ordinarily, the word \u2018omit\u2019 means to disregard, to fail, forbear, neglect to mention, or to fail to insert or include. In fact, the meaning of the word includes the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>failure to do all things that could be done under the circumstances.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b107-6\">See also Reis v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 6 Cir., 142 F.2d 900; Ketcham v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 2 Cir., 142 F.2d 996, 997; Foster\u2019s Estate v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 5 Cir., 131 F.2d 405. The factual situation presented in the case of Uptegrove Lumber Co. v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 3 Cir., 204 F.2d 570, cited and relied upon by the taxpayer clearly distinguishes it from the present case and does not support his contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-7\">We agree with the Tax Court that in his 1945 return the taxpayer omitted from his gross income an amount properly includible therein in excess of 25 per cent of the amount of \u201cgross income stated\u201d in the return. Therefore, the Commissioner\u2019s assessment of the deficiency of $6,461.78 was timely made within the five-year period provided by \u00a7 275(c) of the Internal Revenue Code. The decision of the Tax Court is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b105-21\">.

Gross income for this type of taxpayer is defined by Sec. 29.22(a)-5, Treasury Regulations III as the total sales, less the cost of goods sold, without subtracting depreciation, selling expenses or losses. The tax return shows on its face that the reported \u201cGross profit\u201d of $7,-000.47 is not the same as \u201cgross income\u201d but is the result of deducting from total receipts of $67,105.95 not only the cost of goods sold but also an item of $25,-869.98 (item 6 of Schedule C) which should not be deducted in determining gross income. The failure of the tax form to provide a place where gross income could be specifically stated does not authorize the Commissioner to treat \u201cgross profit\u201d the same as \u201cgross income.\u201d \u201cGross income\u201d can be correctly determined from the figures shown in Schedule C of the return, which is the same schedule showing \u201cgross profit.\u201d See Uptegrove Lumber Co. v.
