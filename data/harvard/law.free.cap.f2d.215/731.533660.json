Under the circumstances, we deemed it advisable to withhold our disposition, until expression had been made upon the question in that litigation by the Arkansas Supreme Court. That Court has now spoken. Winfrey &amp; Carlile v. Nickles, Adm\u2019r, 270 S.W.2d 923.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-20\">The question is whether a lawyer is entitled to charge, or a court has the right to allow, without an order on the part of the Arkansas Workmen\u2019s Compensation Commission, an attorney\u2019s fee on that portion of the funds of a settlement or a recovery, obtained by a workman or his personal representative from a third party, to which the workman\u2019s employer and the latter\u2019s insurance carrier are subrogated, under Ark.Stats. 1947, \u00a7 81-1340, as revised by Acts 1949, No. 4, \u00a7 40, p. 1420, by virtue of such employer\u2019s and carrier\u2019s liability to the workman or his dependents for benefits under the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law of that State, Ark.Stats.1947, \u00a7 81-1301 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"732\">*732</page-number>et seq., as revised, which liability they have duly admitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-4\">The Arkansas Workmen\u2019s Compensation Commission had made the administrative construction of \u00a7 81-1340, as revised, in connection with a distribution of proceeds of that character, in the case which became the subject of review by the Arkansas Supreme Court, that \u201can attorney entering a third party action, being aware of, or chargeable with, the knowledge of the rights of all the parties thereto, where a fee is to be contracted for upon a percentage basis, must limit his percentage to the amount of the recovery effected over and above that amount that must be reimbursed to the employer, or compensation carrier, for the amount of their compensation liability paid, or to be paid, by reason of the accidental injury or death, and * * no fee can be charged against that amount representing the reimbursement fund against which the employer or his compensation insurance carrier has a lien for their compensation liability, except upon petition for, and allowance of same by the Commission.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The state trial court in that case, where a contested, trial and jury submission had been involved, had refused to follow the Commission\u2019s administrative ruling on the distribution necessary under the statute of such part of the proceeds and, without the approval of the Commission, had allowed the attorneys for the employee\u2019s personal representative a fee out of the portion of the recovery to which the employer and his insurance carrier were subrogated by reason of their admitted compensation liability, in addition to an allowance out of the share of the recovery to which the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"733\">*733</page-number>personal representative was directly entitled. The insurance carrier appealed, and the Arkansas Supreme Court affirmed the trial court\u2019s order. See Winfrey &amp; Carlile v. Nickles, Adm\u2019r, 270 S.W.2d 923.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-4\">The basis of the Court\u2019s affirmance was the fact that the proceeds in question, as indicated above, were shown to be the product of a contested trial and jury submission, and its view that the provisions of subsection (c) of \u00a7 81-1340, supra, as to procuring the approval of the Commission to distributions of any proceeds, representing compensation reimbursement, obtained from a third party, and as to not deducting any costs of collection from such proceeds, \u201cexcept upon direction and approval of the Commission\u201d, where the employer or the insurance carrier had admitted liability for compensation, were without application to funds which had had to be thus con-testedly recovered. The Court said that, in having made the requirement in subsection (c) for obtaining the approval of the Commission, \u201cthe legislature meant compromise settlements only\u201d, and that the subsection \u201cdoes not apply to a contested case.\u201d 270 S.W.2d at page 926.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-5\">The present situation is like that case, to the extent that it is one where, without the approval of the Arkansas Workmen\u2019s Compensation Commission, the trial court allowed, to the attorney for the personal representative of a deceased employee, an attorney\u2019s fee out of the portion of some funds, collected from a third party, that represented subrogated compensation reimbursement to the employer and his insurance carrier, in addition to an allowance out of the share of the funds to which the personal representative was directly entitled, and also entered a conforming order of distribution. The appeal here is taken by the employer and the insurance carrier.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-6\">The abbreviated printed record before us does not enable us to tell whether the trial court, in viewing it as unnecessary for the personal representative\u2019s attorney to seek the approval of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Commission to the allowance of an attorney\u2019s fee out of the compensation reimbursement funds, did so on the basis of the distinction drawn by the Arkansas Supreme Court or on some other basis. Statements contained in the brief of appellee (prepared before the Arkansas Supreme Court decision) suggest that appellee, at that time at least, viewed the trial court\u2019s holding as being one to the broad effect that \u00a7 81-1340, supra, did not intend that the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Commission should have anything whatsoever to say or do about funds collected by an employee or his personal representative from a third party, no matter how they had been obtained, until \u201cafter [the] attorneys had been paid.\u201d Whether this was in fact the construction and application which the court made of the statute, we are not able to determine from the printed record.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-8\">Since the decision of the Arkansas Supreme Court, however, appellee, by supplementary written expression, has argued that the situation involved should be held by us to be one that is within the category of what that Court referred to as \u201ca contested case.\u201d Appellants, on the other hand, contend that the funds in question are in actual nature and fact merely proceeds of a compromise settlement. The record, in its present state, does not enable us to make an absolute answer to the question, one way or the other.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-9\">The record does indicate that an action had been instituted by appellee (the deceased employee\u2019s personal representative) against the third party involved, and that the third party had filed an answer, and the employer and the insurance carrier a petition of intervention, in that suit. But the contents of the complaint and the answer are not before us, nor are the details clear of what adversarial path may thereafter have existed in the litigation, although the amount paid seems to have been cloaked, outwardly at least, with a judgment form.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-10\">We would not feel warranted in abstractly assuming that the opinion of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"734\">*734</page-number>Arkansas Supreme Court means that a mere filing of pleadings in court of itself has the effect, for' purposes of the distinction which the Court drew in relation to subsection (c) of \u00a7 81-1340, supra, of necessarily lifting whatever payment may be thereafter made by the third party, for purposes of the statute, into the category of fruits of \u201ca contested case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b778-4\">Nor do we feel entitled to hold abstractly that what may be in fact a compromise settlement of a claim against a third party, without representing the product of such legal services and processes as are usually incident to the preparing, conducting and terminating of litigation, will nevertheless automatically acquire the status of proceeds of \u201ca contested case\u201d, within the use of that term in the Arkansas Supreme Court opinion, merely because the parties, or one of them, may desire, for some extraneous reason or purpose, to have the court cloak the settlement with the formality of a judgment entry.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-5\">For these reasons, we think that the case should be remanded to the trial court, to enable the conflicting contentions of compromise settlement and contested case, now being abstractly urged before us, to be developed and considered in their full light, and with the benefit of that court\u2019s knowledge of the nature of the proceedings had before it. Furthermore, since the trial court\u2019s previous act of allowance cannot here be said to have been made in relation to the construction of the statute contained in the Arkansas Supreme Court\u2019s opinion, it seems only fair that the court should have the opportunity to consider and dispose of the situation on that basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-6\">To enable this to be done, the judgment will be vacated and the cause will be remanded for further proceedings. Neither party will be allowed costs in this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-7\">Judgment vacated and cause remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-8\">A true copy.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b776-5\">. Ark.Stats.1947, \u00a7 81-1340, as revised, contains the following provisions:</p>\n<p id=\"A6T\">Subsection (a) authorizes an employee or his dependents to make claim or maintain an action against any third party for the employee\u2019s injury, without prejudice to the right to compensation benefits from the employer or his insurance carrier, but requires the giving of reasonable notice to the employer or his carrier and opportunity to them to join in the action and \u201cIf they, or either of them, join in such action they shall be entitled to a first lien upon two thirds of the net proceeds recovered in such action that remain after the payment of the reasonable costs of collection, for the payment to them of the amount paid and to be paid by them as compensation to the injured employee or his dependents\u201d, and further \u201cany amount recovered by the injured employee or his dependents from a third party shall be applied as follows: Reasonable costs of collection shall be deducted; then one-third of the remainder shall, in every case, belong to the injured employee or his dependents, as the case may be; the remainder, or so much thereof as is necessary to discharge the actual amount of the liability of the employer and the carrier; and any excess shall belong to the injured employee or his dependents.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b776-6\">Subsection (b) similarly grants to an employer or an insurance carrier, as a matter of subrogation, the right to maintain an action in tort against any third party responsible'for an ' employee\u2019s injury or death, subject to the giving of reasonable notice and opportunity to be represented on the part of the compensation beneficiary and with the following provision as to distribution: \u201cAfter recovery shall be had against such third party, by suit or otherwise, the compensation beneficiary shall be entitled to any amount recovered over and above the amount that the employer and carrier have paid or are liable for in compensation, after deducting reasonable costs of collection, and in no event shall the compensation beneficiary be entitled to less than one-third of the amount recovered from the third party, after deducting the reasonable cost of collection.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"A35\">Subsection (c), which is the one by which the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Commission\u2019s position, as referred to above, was controlled, and which is the basis of appellants\u2019 contention here, reads as follows: \u201cSettlement of such claims under subsections (a) and (b) of this section must have the approval of the Court or of the Commission, except that the distribution of that portion of the settlement which represents the compensation payable under this act must have the approval of the Commission. Where liability is admitted to the injured employee or his dependents by the employer or carrier, no cost of collection shall be deducted from that portion of the settlement under subsections (a) or (b) of this section, representing compensation, except upon direction and approval of the Commission.\u201d\u2019\u2019 \u2022 ,</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
