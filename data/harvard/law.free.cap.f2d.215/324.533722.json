After a trial by jury in the United States District Court he was found guilty and sentenced. These appeals followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">Our examination of the record has brought to our notice a serious question which was not urged in the briefs or oral argument, namely, whether the trial court erred in failing to suppress certain evidence seized by the police from appellant\u2019s rooms. Under Rule 52(b) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, 18 U.S.C.A., we can, of course, notice \u201cPlain errors or defects affecting substantial rights * * * although they were not brought to the attention of the court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b370-6\">The record discloses that early in the trial the prosecution called Officer Douglas of the Metropolitan Police. He testified that at about 3:30 in the morning of January 3, 1952, he went to appellant\u2019s house and knocked on the door. Appellant replied, he said, by asking \u201cWho is it?\u201d Douglas responded, \u201cIt is the police.\u201d A long interval passed. Douglas knocked again and said, \u201cCome on, open up.\u201d During the interval Douglas heard \u201ca door being pushed open near the rear of his room and a sliding sound on the floor.\u201d Appellant finally opened the door and the officer arrested him. Douglas opened the door in the rear of the room and found a Navy jacket, a target pistol, and other objects, all in a box inside the adjoining room. Douglas questioned appellant about these objects and was told by the latter that he had found them in Rock Creek Park. Douglas also asked appellant about a number of holdups, but appellant denied having taken part in them. The officer took appellant and the jacket and other objects to the police station, and turned him and the effects over to the Robbery Squad. Douglas further testified that he came to look for the appellant because \u2014 and this, he said, was his only source of information \u2014 a man bad told him that Contee \u201cwas the party that had been involved in some robberies * * * I don\u2019t know the man\u2019s name even. He was a man that lived in the neighborhood, apparently, and knew Contee.\u201d This man was not, Douglas said, one of the complaining witnesses. Early in the course of the examination of the officer, appellant\u2019s court-appointed attorney said, \u201cI will have to object to this testimony unless it is established he had probable cause to make an investigation.\u201d The court replied that there had been no motion to suppress. Counsel answered, \u201cI was not aware of all this evidence.\u201d The objection was overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-8\">At the conclusion of Douglas\u2019 testimony appellant\u2019s counsel said, \u201cIn spite of the fact that a motion to suppress was not filed, I think it was clear that the evidence in question taken by the officer was illegally seized and should not be admitted in evidence.\u201d The court then said, \u201cI am going to overrule your motion, both on the ground it should have been made before, because the rules seem to contemplate that, but, even so, I think in view of the fact there was a voluntary offering of it to him, it is proper.\u201d After further colloquy, the court overruled the objection as to the admission of the coat. It sustained the objection as to certain cartridges and a wallet, evidently on the ground that these latter had not been sufficiently identified.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-9\">Rule 41(e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure provides that a motion to suppress evidence unlawfully obtained \u201cshall be made before trial or hearing unless opportunity therefor did not exist or the defendant was not aware of the grounds for the motion, but the court in its discretion may entertain the motion at the trial or hearing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b370-10\">We think that under all the circumstances of the present case the court erred in denying the motion to suppress. In the first place, it seems clear that the property in question was illegally seized, in violation of the Fourth Amendment. There was no search warrant, and no arrest warrant. We think it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>plain as a matter of law that the appellant did not freely consent to the search. Johnson v. United States, 1948, 333 U.S. 10, 68 S.Ct. 367, 92 L.Ed. 436; Higgins v. United States, D.C. Cir., 1954, 209 F.2d 819; Judd v. United States, 1951, 89 U.S.App.D.C. 64, 190 F.2d 649. The Government now argues that the search may be justified as an incident of the arrest under the doctrine of United States v. Rabinowitz, 1950, 339 U.S. 56, 70 S.Ct. 430, 94 L.Ed. 653. But to justify the search on this ground the arrest itself must be valid. United States v. Rabinowitz, supra, 339 U.S. at page 60, 70 S.Ct. 430. Here it clearly was not. The question is \u2014 did the officer making the arrest have probable cause to believe that the person arrested had committed an offense? See Mills v. United States, 90 U.S.App.D.C. 365, 196 F.2d 600, certiorari denied, 1952, 344 U.S. 826, 73 S.Ct. 27, 97 L.Ed. 643. As we have seen, the officer here testified that an individual who \u201clived in the neighborhood, apparently, and knew Contee\u201d was his sole source of information. An uncorroborated tip by an informer whose identity and reliability are both unknown does not constitute probable cause to make an arrest.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> ******Nor is any exceptional circumstance alleged to have existed here: there is no suggestion that appellant would have escaped, or that there was any necessity for apprehending him in the small hours of the morning.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\"> In the second place, we think the motion to suppress was timely made. Appellant\u2019s attorney \u2014 appointed by the court- \u2014 stated that he was not aware of the seized evidence. This statement by counsel would appear to satisfy, prima facie at least, the provision of the rule allowing a motion to be made during trial if the defendant \u201cwas not aware of the grounds for the motion.\u201d The court made no inquiry to test the validity of counsel\u2019s statement, but denied the motion without further questioning. If it had questioned further it would have found that the defendant had been adjudicated mentally incompetent shortly after his apprehension and that he had spent nearly a year thereafter in mental institutions under circumstances to be discussed presently. True, some element of neglect on the part of counsel may have entered in. But under the circumstances we must give the accused the benefit -of the doubt, and hold that the court\u2019s peremptory rejection of counsel\u2019s statement was erroneous. We think that it was plain error affecting substantial rights, within the meaning of Rule 52(b). The conviction must be reversed and a new trial granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-15\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b371-16\">In this disposition of the case we do not reach the questions posed by counsel in their briefs and argument.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Nor do we need to canvass at length the issue, briefed and argued by counsel at our request, of appellant\u2019s fitness to stand trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-17\">After appellant\u2019s apprehension and arraignment, the District Court appointed counsel to represent him. Counsel moved that appellant receive a mental examination, and the court on February 12, 1952, ordered him committed for that purpose. Physicians\u2019 reports were received on March 4 and March 6, advising the court that appellant was of unsound mind and suffering from de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>ment\u00eda praecox. The United States Attorney thereupon moved the court for a judicial determination of the mental competency of the accused, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4244 (1952), on the basis of the physicians\u2019 reports. An inquisition under that statute was held by the court on March 14, during which testimony was received from both doctors. The court found appellant \u201cpresently insane and so mentally incompetent as to be unable to understand the proceedings against him, or properly to assist in his own defense.\u201d Appellant was then committed to St. Elizabeths Hospital. On January 29, 1953, the Superintendent of the Hospital addressed a letter to the Attorney General of the United States which said, in part, that \u201cIt has now been determined that Michael M. Contee, Jr., is mentally competent to stand trial and is able to consult with counsel and properly assist in his own defense.\u201d Appellant was then removed to the District of Columbia jail, and without further order of the court was brought to trial on March 3, 1953. This procedure was erroneous, for the reasons stated in Gunther v. United States, 1954, 94 U.S. App.D.C., 215 F.2d 493. Before appellant is again tried, a judicial determination of his competency to stand trial should be made.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-5\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b372-6\">One other matter seems to us to require comment. While the case was pending here we inquired of the United States Attorney, by order to show cause, why the Director of the Bureau of Prisons had not acted pursuant to the provisions of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4245 (1952) with respect to this appellant, in view of numerous indications in the record before us that appellant had long been suffering from mental illness. That section provides a procedure for the relief of convicted persons incarcerated in Federal prisons who, there is probable cause to believe, were mentally incompetent at the time of their trials.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In such a case, after the Director of the Bureau of Prisons has made an appropriate certificate, the District Court wherein the conviction was had holds a hearing to determine the mental competency of the accused at the time of the trial. However, a proviso in Section 4245 limits its application to cases where \u201cthe issue of mental competency was not raised and determined before or during * * * trial.\u201d The United States Attorney in his return stated that it was the view of the Bureau of Prisons and its Director that this proviso barred the application of Section 4245 to Con-tee, since in his case \u201ca proceeding had been had under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4244, et seq., and a certificate had been made to the District Court on January 29, 1953, that Contee was competent to stand trial * * We think this position erroneous as a matter of law. In appellant\u2019s case no judicial determination had been made of the kind of which the proviso in Section 4245 speaks, namely, that he was competent to stand trial. On the contrary, he was the subject of a judicial determination that he was incompetent to stand trial, followed simply by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>an administrative finding of competency. Under these circumstances the benefits of Section 4245 should not have been denied him if he was otherwise entitled to them. Our disposition of these appeals, however, makes it unnecessary for us to enter any order on this subject.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-4\">The judgments of the District Court will be</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">Reversed, and new trial granted.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b371-6\">.

The court relies upon Gunther v. United States, 94 U.S. App.D.C.-, 215 F.2d 493, decided July 1, 1954.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-10\">The determination of incompetency in March 1952 was the result of proceedings initiated by motion filed pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4244. See Perry v. United States, 90 U.S.App.D.C. 186, 195 F.2d 37. Such motion was for a \u201cjudicial determination\u201d as to the accused\u2019s mental competency; when that determination, to the effect he was then incompetent to stand trial, was made, the purpose of the motion was fulfilled. It was no longer pending. A period of hospitalization at St. Elizabeths Hospital followed. Then came the certification of its Superintendent, in February 1953, that the accused was of sound mind, after which he was brought to trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-11\">Proceedings for a judicial determination under \u00a7 4244 are initiated only by motion of the United States Attorney, or of defense counsel, or of the court <em>sua sponte. </em>At the trial accused was represented by the same able counsel who had initiated the \u00a7 4244 proceedings in 1952. He did not move for another inquiry as to competency. Nor did the United States Attorney. Nor did the court. The record shows that all were fully aware of the 1952 determination of incompetency.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-14\">The case of Gunther v. United States, supra, is illustrative of a situation which calls for another inquiry before trial; but I think this is not so, as the court there held, because of a requirement of the statute itself, no motion under it for further inquiry having been made. It is so because, apart from statute, proper administration of the criminal law called for another inquiry in the factual situation presented. See excerpts from the legislative history quoted in the court\u2019s Gunther opinion. My difficulty is that the opinion grounds the necessity for a further judicial determination upon the statute itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-15\">The statute prescribes its method of raising the issue of competency; that is, as above set forth, by motion.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The court adds a provision, not inserted by Congress, to the effect that where there has once been a judicial determination, of incompetency, another, of competency, is a statutory requirement in any and all circumstances, before a trial can be had, notwithstanding evidence of restoration to competency accepted as satisfactory by counsel for the accused, by the United States Attorney, and by the court, none of whom invokes by motion the available statutory provisions for a further inquiry.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-16\">The Gunther opinion, furthermore, contains I think two inconsistencies with the statute it purports to follow. In the first place, in relying upon the original motion as if it were still pending, the court nevertheless ruled that the case could go to trial after a determination not based upon the only kind of hearing such a motion leads to once an adverse report by a court appointed psychiatrist has been made, as was there done. In the second place, in the situation there assumed by the court to exist, namely, an effective motion before trial, the stat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>ute requires that the judicial determination precede the trial. Perry v. United States, 'supra. Nevertheless, the court did not grant a new trial so that the determination of competency might precede it, but held that such determination might be made long afterwards, thus assimilating \u00a7 4244 proceedings to those under \u00a7 4245.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> *****8</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b374-25\">. In not reversing and remanding for a new trial in Gunther, under the procedure adopted in Perry, the court seeks to distinguish Perry on the ground that no previous determination of incompetency had there been made and hence there was no medical certificate of recovery and competency to stand trial. It seems to me that the determination of incompetency in Gunther is a more compelling reason for following the Perry procedure than existed for its original adoption, which nevertheless I think was sound,</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b373-17\">. After trial the issue may be raised in accordance with the provisions of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4245.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
