This note is given for an actual loan of the above amount and is secured by a trust dieed of even date herewith, which is a first lien on the property herein described.

The note is indorsed on its hack in blank and without date to John B. Lubbock and William B. Lubbock by the Jarvis-Conklin Mortgage Trust Co. At the time the note was made the makers executed a deed in trust upon a certain tract of land to secure its payment. The deed in trust provided that in case of suit, 10 per cent should be recoverable by the trustee for the use of the attorney. The note was indorsed by the payee to John B. Lubbock and W. B. Lubbock. They, together with S. M. Jarvis, the trustee of the deed in trust, brought suit upon the note and to enforce the lien of the mortgage. Henry Fields having died, the suit was brought against Mary Fields, his executrix. She died while the action was pending, and it was revived against R. C. Parks, as \"administrator de bonis non of Henry Fields\u2019 estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-3\">The defendant pleaded that the contract was usurious, and sought to defeat a recovery for the interest. The trial court held that there was no usury in the contract and gave judgment for the full amount claimed. The Court of Civil Appeals took the same view of the transaction and affirmed the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-4\">We incline to think that, treating the question as one to be decided by the common law, the Court of Civil Appeals, in holding that the contract was not usurious, reached a correct conclusion. Interest, as known to the common law, is defined as \u201ca compensation usually reckoned by a percentage of the loan, use, or forbearance of the money.\u201d Abbott\u2019s Law Diet.; Am. and Eng. Enc. of Law. This does not embrace the compensation for the detention of money beyond the time at which it ivas agreed to be paid \u2014 that is to say, after the maturity of the debt. Therefore the parties to a contract for the payment of money might lawfully stipulate that, upon the failure of the debtor to pay at maturity, he should pay for its detention a rate in excess of what the law would allow as interest. The sum so agreed to be paid for the detention of the money is treated not as interest, but as a penalty for failing to pay at maturity. The authorities seem to be practically unanimous in upholding the legality of such a stipulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-5\">But we think our statute has made a different rule. It defines interest as follows: \u201cArticle 3097. \u2018Interest\u2019 is the compensation allowed by law or fixed by the parties to a contract for the use or forbearance or detention of money.\u201d According to this article, as we analyze it, the use' of money referred to is that which is contracted for when a loam is made; the forbearance occurs when there is a debt due or to become due and the parties agree to extend the time for its payment; the detention of money arises in a case when a debt has become due and the debtor withholds its payment without a new contract giving him a right to do so. It follows, therefore, that what would have been deemed a penalty under the rfile of the common law is made interest under our statute; and if the rate agreed upon for the detention of the money after the maturity of the debt exceed the 10 per cent per annum, the contract is usurious and is void as to interest. Rev. Stats., art. 3104.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>The definition above quoted was not contained in our first statute upon the subject of interest. It first appeared in the Revised Statutes of 1879 as article 2972. It was probably borrowed from the Civil Code of California, article 1915 of which defines \u201cinterest\u201d in precisely the same words. Article <em>1095 </em>of the Revised Codes of Dakota gives the following definition of the word: \u201cInterest is the compensation allowed for the use, or forbearance, or detention of money, or its equivalent.\u201d According to Stimson, the Civil Code of Louisiana contained the same definition (1 Stimson\u2019s Statutory Law, article ,4810); but we have found it in neither of the codes of that State to which we have access. We have not found, however, any decision by the courts of either of the States mentioned in which the definition has ever been construed, nevertheless, the conclusion is not to be resisted that there ivas a purpose in adding the word \u201cdetention\u201d to the accepted definition of \u201cinterest,\u201d and that this purpose was to meet the case when the debtor should detain the money owed beyond the stipulated period of forbearance, and so to provide that a promise to pay an additional sum for such detention should be deemed interest, and not merely damages by Avay of a penalty' to secure a prompt performance of the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-5\">The attention of the Court of Civil Appeals was not called to the definition of the word \u201cinterest\u201d as contained in our statute, and they seem to have overlooked it in deciding the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-6\">The other questions presented by the appeal and the application for the writ of error were, we think, correctly disposed of by the opinion of that court.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-7\">The judgment of the District Court and that of the Court of Civil Appeals are reversed and judgment is here rendered for the sum lent without interest, less the admitted credits, and for 10 per cent attorney\u2019s fees and costs of the District Court, and for the foreclosure of the mortgage. The defendants in error will pay.the costs of the appeal and of the writ of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-8\">It is further ordered that this judgment be certified to the County Court for observance.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-9\">\n<em>Reversed and rendered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
