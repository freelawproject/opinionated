Adkins.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-7\">\u2018\u201cWe hereby guarantee the fulfillment of the above and foregoing contract for and on the part of Felix Mann, this 3d day of .September, 1894.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-8\">\u201c\u2018Wji. Beyans,</p>\n<p id=\"b413-9\">\u201c\u2018W. W. Lewis/ \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b413-10\">We make the following condensed statement of the facts certified which are applicable to the question answered by us. \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"b413-11\">Eleven hundred and seven head of cattle were gathered by Mann at his ranch and he notified the Dublin Cotton Oil Company of the fact, when Connell, the president of the company, went to the ranch and accepted the cattle in part performance of the contract. Mann had the cattle driven to or near Brownwood. Jas. A. White was the bearer \u2022of the following note: \u201cThe bearer, Jas. A. White, will represent me in weighing my cattle. Tours truly, Felix Mann.\u201d Which note was delivered by White to Connell, the president of the cotton oil company. There were no suitable scales at Brownwood to weigh the cattle on, which were held at that place without feed and water, and the next morning White had them loaded on the cars and they were shipped to Dublin, where they were weighed without being watered or fed.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-12\">The guarantors, Lewis and Bevans, at no time consented to the removal of the cattle from Brownwood to Dublin to be weighed, nor did they consent to any change in the contract. No other cattle were ever delivered under the contract except 1107 head.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-13\">The following questions are submitted:</p>\n<p id=\"b413-14\">1. \u201cDid the written authority of Mann to White authorize the latter, \u25a0as to Mann, to carry the cattle to Dublin to be weighed?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b413-15\"><em>2. </em>\u201cIf Lewis and Bevans did not consent to have the cattle weighed at Dublin and they did not ratify the same, and plaintiff accepted the \u25a0cattle and their weights as weighed at Dublin, would such alteration in the contract in the part performance of it discharge the guarantor\u00bb Lewis and Bevans?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b413-16\">We answer the first question in the negative. The writing submitted empowers Jas. A. White to perform a particular act, \u2014 to superintend the weighing of the cattle according to the contract between the parties, but did not authorize him to vary from the terms of the contract in the time, place, or manner of weighing them.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-17\">The answer to be given to the second question depends upon the determination of a question of fact not found by the Court of Civil Appeals; that is, did the Dublin Cotton Oil Company consent to the talcing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>of the cattle to Dublin to be weighed? If they did consent, one answer would probably be given, and if it did not, a different answer might be made to the question. This court has no power to determine questions of fact from conflicting testimony submitted to it, and we must decline to answer the second question, because the issue of fact has not been determined by the Court of Civil Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-5\">As to the manner of certifying questions to this court, we invite attention to Railway v. Zantzinger, this day decided by this court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
