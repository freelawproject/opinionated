(P. 316.)</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b346-8\">2. Same \u2014 Reference to Previous Deed.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b346-9\">A judgment and deed in foreclosure described a tract of one acre in a square, and for \u201ca better description\u201d referred to a previous deed in which was conveyed, in addition to such acre tract, a smaller and adjoining one. The reference to the deed for description was insufficient to include the smaller tract also in the land foreclosed upon.

Same \u2014 Mistake in Courses \u2014 Lines Inclosing Nothing.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b346-11\">A judgment and sheriff\u2019s deed described a tract of land by four courses, with distances each of seventy yards, \u2014 the courses from the beginning point being, thence north, thence south, thence east, thence west to the beginning, \u2014 and referred, for \u201cbetter description,\u201d to a previous deed in which the courses were north, east, south, aind west, respectively. Held, that, if the mistake was not indeed so obvious as to make apparent the land intended, the description was aided by the reference to the previous deed, and was sufficient to identify the land.

Brown v. Chambers, 63 Texas, 135; Martindale on Conveyancing, sec. 108.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b347-5\">Where the body of the land is sufficiently described to identify it beyond doubt, and control with sufficient certainty particular erroneous descriptions, the latter may be rejected to give effect to the former and uphold the deed. Smith v. Chatham, 14 Texas, 322.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b347-6\"><em>W. P. McLean, B. Boston, </em>and <em>Sheppard &amp; Jones, </em>for defendant in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AlB\">If the description in the petition referring to the Freeman and James deed to Meadors can be considered by the court, then the metes and boundary description is superior to it. See the following' authorities supporting the legal proposition that where an instrument contains a description of a tract of land by metes and. bounds, and also refers to another instrument as containing a description of the same tract of land, and there is a variance between the two descriptions, the description of the land by metes and bounds will control: Cullers v. Platt, 81 Texas, 258; Koenigheim v. Miles, 67 Texas, 113; Cassidy v. Bank, 21 N. E. Rep., 372; Stark v. Spalding, 39 S. W. Rep., 234; Prentice v. Railway, 14 U. S., 997; Cummings v. Black, 25 Atl.

Rep., 29.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b347-8\">The reference to the deed of the Freemans and James to Meadors of October 27, 1894, in the original petition of foreclosure and the judgment rendered thereon and order of sale and sheriff\u2019s deed, are void, because said deed and its record were at that time and prior thereto destroyed by fire. Brown v. Chambers, 63 Texas, 131.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b347-9\">If the ambiguity in the description of the judgment, order of sale, and sheriff\u2019s deed were latent, the court should have submitted the case to the jury. Brown v. Chambers, 63 Texas, 131. But if the ambiguity was patent, parol evidence was not admissible to explain it. Beze v. Calvert, 20 S. W.

T. Roberts, and one D. B. Meadors and A. L. Forgatson, in an ordinary action of trespass to try title to the following described land, to wit:</p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">\u201cSituated in Titus County, Texas, about nine miles southwest from the town of Mount Pleasant, and being a part of the Mary Morris headright survey; beginning 22 yards from the gin situated on said survey, and known as the J. E. Freeman Bros.\u2019 gin, and 22 yards from the southwest corner of the said gin tract of land, a stake; thence north 36 yards, a stake; thence east 70 yards, a stake; thence south 36 yards, a stake; thence west 70 yards to the place of beginning.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-6\">\u201cAlso one acre out of the same survey, being 70 yards square, and adjoining the above tract on the south; that there is situated on said land a steam gin and grist mill, and the rental value of the same is $200 per month.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-7\">\u201cAppellees then set out their claim of title in their petition, which was that they owned and claimed title to said land by purchase at sheriff\u2019s sale, under a judgment of the District Court of Morris County, rendered on- April 10, 1896, which judgment foreclosed a vendor\u2019s lien against each and all of the defendants in this suit. Appellees then pleaded an error in the judgment of the District Court of Morris County as to the description of the land in the foreclosure suit, and seek a foreclosure on the land in controversy against each and all of the defendants. Appellees\u2019 prayer is for the title and possession of the land and for damages and costs; and in the alternative, that if the appellees did not acquire a good title to the lands herein sued for under the decree of the foreclosure suit in the District Court of Morris County, and the order of sale and the sheriff\u2019s deed, then for this court to declare said order of the District Court of Morris County, and the sheriff\u2019s deed for said land, and sheriff\u2019s deed to said appellees void, and set aside and annul same, and then to foreclose the vendor\u2019s lien on the land described in their petition as to all the defendants, and for a judgment against the defendant D.

The jury found for plaintiffs for the land and $125 rents, and, in accordance with said verdict, the court rendered a judgment for the plaintiffs for the land described in plaintiffs\u2019 petition, against each and all of the defendants, and against the defendant J. T. Roberts and his sureties on his replevy bond the sum of $125 for the use and occupation of the premises from July 18, 1896, to date, and against the defendants for costs.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b348-10\">********</p>\n<p id=\"b348-11\">\u201cPlaintiffs read in evidence a certified copy of the judgment rendered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>in the District Court of Morris County on April 10, 1896, in the case of Sanger Bros. v.

testified in the case say that the description given in appellees\u2019 petition in this suit is the same description contained in the-deed from the Freemans and James to Meadors, referred to in the petition in the foreclosure suit in the District Court of Morris County, judgment and order of sale, and sheriff\u2019s deed to appellees.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b350-8\">We note that in that portion of petition in this case which purports to describe the land sued for, the words \u201cthat there is situated on said land a steam gin and grist mill and the rental value of the same is $200 per month,\u201d are not found. The allegations a.re found in another part of the petition, where they are doubtless inserted with a view to recover rents. The correction is important only in view of the fact that the witnesses who identified the land conveyed by the deed from James and others to Meadors as being the same as that given in the petition most likely referred to that part of the petition only which purported to describe the premises for which the suit was brought.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-9\">We concur in the proposition announced by the Court of Civil Appeals, that when there is a repugnancy between a particular description of a tract of land in a deed and a general description, the former will, as a general rule, control. In other words, where the premises are described by metes and bounds and that is followed by a reference to some other writing for a further description, the latter can not ordinarily be looked to to enlarge the former.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-10\">But we are of the opinion that, in applying the rule, the court has given it too broad a scope. The petition in the foreclosure suit gives all the lines by proper courses and distances to embrace one acre of land in the form of a square, and then follows a reference to the deed to Meadors for \u201ca better description.\u201d The proof showed that the Meadors deed contained a description of two parcels, a rectangle extending thirty-six yards north and south and seventy yards east and west; the other an acre seventy yards square lying south of and adjoining the tract <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>above described. There is clearly no repugnancy here. The description of a tract of an acre of the same shape and with lines running the same -courses and distances is \u201ccontained in\u201d the Meadors deed. It is perhaps a better description, because it may be better capable of being identified upon the ground bjr .reason of the reference to the other parcel described in that conveyance. But that the reference to the Meadors deed does not enlarge the description in the petition in the foreclosure suit so as to embrace the first tract described in it we think too clear for argument. But we think it equally clear that if the judgment, order of sale and sheriff\u2019s deed had followed the description in the petition, the title to the parcel of one acre would have passed to the purchaser at the sheriff\u2019s sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">But it is just here, as it seems to us, that the difficulty arises. In the judgment, order of sale, and in the sheriff\u2019s deed, the calls for the courses and distances of the boundary lines of the one acre parcel, taken literally, describe nothing. But it may be a question whether the mistake is not so obvious as to make apparent the land which was intended to be designated. Coffey v. Hendricks, 66 Texas, 676. It is clear, we think, that the mistake is as to the course of some of the limes and not as to the length of either. The first call is from the beginning point north seventy yards, and the second is from the point so reached south seventy yards; from which it is evident that there is a mistake in the call for the course of the second line. So if we reverse the calls, we would run east from the point of beginning, west seventy yards, and back east the same distance along the same line. We have .at all events the first line well established, and probably the last; and we know the length of all the lines. If we have the two lines established, as the diagram given by the court would show them, then, in order to complete the survey by two other lines each of the length of seventy yards and make the field notes close, it would be necessary to run from the north end of the first line east seventy yards, and from the east end of the last, north the same distance. In no other manner could we construct a quadrangle of four sides of seventy yards each upon the lines so established. But if on the other hand it should be held that the last line is not fixed, then it would seem there is enough in the description to show that the intention was to project a square extending east upon the established first line. All the calls run to the cardinal points of the compass, and there is no call running west of that line, while there is one to run east. It would seem, therefore, from the face of the description itself, that in copying the field notes the clerk made a mistake in the second call by writing \u201csouth\u201d instead of \u201ceast;\u201d and in the third by writing \u201ceast\u201d instead of \u201csouth.\u201d Whether the mistake is so obvious that the field notes should be held to correct themselves is a question, however, which we do not find it necessary to determine. If not, the reference to the deed to Meadors makes clear what was before obscure. It describes the land \u201cas an acre seventy yards square adjoining the above tract on the south.\u201d The \u201cabove tract\u201d referred to is approximately a half acre, the south boundary of which is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>seventy yards long and extends directly east and west. With the aid of that description, no person of ordinary intelligence could fail to see what land was attempted to be described by the purported field notes in the judgment of foreclosure and to fix its identity with certainty. If the defendant in that suit had thought that his land, by reason of the blunder in the description, would bring less at the sheriff\u2019s sale than it ought to bring, he could have had the judgment entry amended and the land described as it was described in the petition in that suit. If his land was sold for an inadequate price and the inadequacy was traceable to the manner in which the land was described in the decree, he might have had the sale set aside in a direct proceeding brought for that purpose. But he can not take advantage of the irregularity in the description in a collateral attack.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">Because the trial court charged the jury to find a verdict for the plaintiffs for all the land described in their petition, and because the Court of Civil Appeals adjudged that they should take no part.of it, the judgment of each is reversed and the cause remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-6\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
