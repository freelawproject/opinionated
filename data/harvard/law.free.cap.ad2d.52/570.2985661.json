Order modified, on the facts, by deleting therefrom the words: \"the court\u2019s order shall take effect at the end of the present semester in January 1976\u201d and substituting therefor the words: \"the court\u2019s order shall take effect at the end of the semester in June, 1976\u201d. As so modified, order affirmed, without costs or disbursements. The record clearly supports the trial court\u2019s conclusion that respondent is a loving and fit mother and that a change of custody was not warranted (cf. <em>Matter of Irene O., </em>38 NY2d 776; <em>Matter of Ebert v Ebert, </em>38 NY2d 700). The petitioner should be awarded liberal visitation rights, application for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>which may be made to the Family Court. Hopkins, Acting P. J., Cohalan, Christ, Shapiro and Titone, JJ., concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
