No point is made as to the form or sufficency of this particular ordinance; but the sole question presented to this Court (as by counsel stipulated) is, Has the City of Olympia, under its present charter, power to pass an ordinance fixing the rate of liquor license at a greater sum than the maximum amount fixed by general law, and to prescribe pun<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>ishment by fine and imprisonment for a violation of such ordinance ?</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b349-3\"><em>Judson $ </em>Israel, and <em>Gerrit T. </em>Thorne, for Plaintiff in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b349-4\">Section 16 of the City Charter, giving the power under which the ordinance was passed, reads as follows : \u201c The City of Olympia shall have power to regulate, license and tax all carts, drays, trucks, wagons, carriages, coaches, omnibusses and other vehicles kept for hire * * * and to prescribe and fix the rate thereof, * * * to license, regulate or restrain drinking saloons, beer shops, breweries and other places where intoxicating or other beverages are sold or disposed of.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b349-5\">The power here given must be construed as power to prescribe by ordinance rules for regulation, only and not for revenue or taxation.

If the temperance element prevailed in the Council, they could so fix the rate that no man could engage in the business. Its license exactions would operate as prohibition. This, clearly, is not warranted by our laws.

A special charter or statute prevails over the general law. The city has, by her charter, exclusive control over the licensing of drinking saloons within the corporate limits, and so long as the rate fixed be reasonable, she has not stepped beyond her power.

On appeal to the District Court of the Second Judicial District, holding terms at Olympia, having waived a jury trial, he was, after hearing before the Judge of said Court, again convicted.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-7\">The case is brought here on writ of error, the parties waiving by stipulation, notice and assignment of errors required by the statute, and presenting to this Court for decision one question only, namely: \u201c Has the City of Olympia power to pass an ordinance fixing the rates of saloon or liquor licenses within its limits, in amount greater than the amount fixed by the general laws of the Territory ? \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b352-8\">The general laws referred to is the act entitled \u201c Act in relation to Licenses,\u201d approved November 13th, 1873, in which it. is provided that annual licenses to keep drinking houses or saloons in the several counties of the Territory shall be granted,, upon the payment into the county treasury of three hundred dollars, and the giving bond to keep such house or saloon in a-quiet, peaceable, and orderly manner. The act further provided that the County Commissioners of any county might grant li<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>censes for less than three hundred dollars, where little business was done, but in no case for less than one hundred. The act further provided that all moneys collected under the act for licenses, within the corporate limits of the Town of Olympia-should be paid directly into the town treasury of said town as-a municipal fund for the use of the town.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-4\">This law constituted a limitation on the Town of Olympia by virtue of the provisions of an act to amend the charter of said! town, approved November 11th, 1873, in which it was declared that the Board of Trustees of the town should have the same-powers, within the limits of the town, as were conferred by the general law upon County Commissioners, and that licenses were-to be issued in conformity to the general laws regulating the issue of licenses throughout the Territory. The ordinance of the City of Olympia, for a violation of which the plaintiff in error was convicted, fixed the rate of license for saloons at more than three hundred dollars.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">We are of the opinion that the acts in question, which were limitations upon the powers of the Town of Olympia, were repealed by the act entitled \u201c An Act to incorporate the City of Olympia, approved November 28,1883 ; and that the power of the city to exact the payment of the sum named, as a requisite to the right to keep a drinking house or saloon, must be governed exclusively by the provisions of the latter act.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-6\">We are also of opinion that the City of Olympia has power under the said act to require the payment of a sum greater than three hundred dollars per annum. A majority of the Court consider the exaction of the sum fixed by the city ordinance as a proper exercise of the police power conferred by the authority to-\u201clicense, regulate, or restrain drinking saloons,\u201d &amp;c. A minority of the Court, consisting of the Judge who renders this opinion, considers the language of the act broad enough to authorize the exaction of a license tax, and would doubt the power to demand so large a sum for a license, considered merely as a police-regulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-7\">However, the conclusion is the same, and the judgment of the Court below is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-8\">We concur: S. C. Wingard, Associate Justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-9\">Roger S. Greene, Chief Justice.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
