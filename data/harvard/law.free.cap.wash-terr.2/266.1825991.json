To the complaint, the defendant, who is here defendant in error, answered, 1st, denying each and every allegation in the complaint; and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>2d, alleging \u201c that each and every of the said causes of action, sis alleged in plaintiff\u2019s complaint, did not accrue within six years before the commencement of this action.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b275-3\">The plaintiff failed to file any reply within the time limited by the rules of the Court, whei-eupon defendant filed a motion, .asking that the default of the plaintiff might be entered, and that he have judgment against plaintiff upon the pleadings. This motion the Court sustained, and entered the judgment fx-orn which this writ of error is taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-4\">We are of opinion that the District Coux-t erred in sustaining the motion. The attempted plea of the Statute of Limitations \u25a0contained a negative pregnant; therefore the judgment of that \"Court must be reversed, and the cause remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">We concur: John P.
