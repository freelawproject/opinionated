There can be .no action in this Territory for such neglect, unless it is given by \u2022statute. The common law governs unless superseded by statute. <em>(Russell </em>v. <em>Men of Devon, </em>2d Term Reports, Durnford and East, 667; <em>Winbigler </em>v. <em>Los Angeles, </em>45 Cal. 36; <em>Detroit </em>v. <em>Blakely, </em>21 Mich. 84; Same Case in 4th American, 450; <em>Eastman </em>v. <em>Meredith, </em>36 New Hampshire, 284; <em>Hill </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>122 Mass. 344; <em>Wixon </em>v. <em>Newport, </em>13 Rhode Island, 454; <em>Altnow </em>v. <em>Town of Sibley, </em>30 Minn. 186; <em>Kent </em>v. <em>Cheyenne, </em>2 <em>Wyoming, 6</em>; <em>Nerasota </em>v. <em>Pearce, </em>46 Tex. 525; <em>Grand Rapids </em>v. <em>Wyman, </em>46 Mich. 516; <em>Oliver </em>v. <em>Worcester, </em>102 Mass. 496, 499.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b325-7\">This provision of the charter gives the extent of corporate power that defendant has over the sidewalks within its corporate limits. There is no other statute giving any right of action \u2022except Section 662 of the Code, which provides that action may be maintained for an injury to the rights of plaintiff arising irom some act or omission of the corporation.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b325-8\">The plaintiff assumes that the duty of defendant to repair \u2022sidewalks is mandatory; a ministerial duty that is positively \u2022commanded or necessarily implied by the provisions of the charter. Wc insist that the duty of the defendant in this matter is very clearly judicial, and not discretionary. The power of a city council in matters of street improvements is a specially del<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>egated authority, and the acts of the city government thereunder are legal only when tliey are strictly in conformity with its directions. (Dillon on Municipal Corporations, 3d ed., Sec. 89; <em>Carron </em>v. Martin, 2 Dutcher, N. J. 594; <em>State, Terhune, Pros. </em>v. <em>Passaic, </em>41 N.

J. Law, 660; M<em>inturn </em>v. <em>Lorne, </em>23 Howard, W. S. 437, and cases there referred to; <em>Chicago </em>v. <em>Rumpf, </em>45 Ill. 90; <em>Merriam </em>v.

Under the provision of this act, a city is responsible for injuries occasioned by defects in the carriage-way or street proper, and in the cross walks, but not sidewalks. <em>(Detroit </em>v. <em>Putnam, </em>45 Mich. 263; <em>O\u2019Neill </em>v. <em>Detroit, </em>50 Mich. 133.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b326-6\">Opinion by</p>\n<author id=\"Ah7\">Greene, Chief Justice.</author>\n<p id=\"b326-7\">This is a suit in error to reverse a judgment which was rendered upon sustaining a demurrer to the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-8\">The single question submitted to this Court for its decision is, as to the liability of the city of Olympia, under its charter and the statutes of this Territory, to an action by a private person for an injury caused by the neglect of the city to repair a defect in one of its sidewalks.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>Section G2, and Subdivision 25 of Section 3, appear to be the only parts of the defendant\u2019s charter material to be considered. These are as follows :</p>\n<p id=\"b327-4\"><em>\"</em>Sec. 62. The wards, streets, and alleys within said city limits shall be under the exclusive control of the common council, who shall make all needful rules in regard to the improvement, repair, grading, cleaning, etc., etc., thereof, and for the purposes of this act, said city shall not be included in any road district; but the road tax due by law within the city shall be collected as provided by ordinance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">\u201c Twenty-fifth.\u201d \u201c To construct and repair sidewalks, and to remove obstructions from streets, alleys, sidewalks and sewers, and to levy and collect a special tax or assessment upon all blocks, lots, or parcels of land fronting on such streets, alleys, or sidewalks within the city limits, sufficient to pay the expenses-of such improvement, or repair, or removal of obstruction ; and for such purpose may establish districts consisting of the blocks,, lots, or parcels of land fronting in the whole or such portions o\u00a3 the street, alley, or sidewalk to be made or repaired, as may be deemed advisable. -A lot or parcel of land shall he deemed tn front on an alley when such alley runs through it, or it shall touch upon said alley. But in no case shall such sidewalk be built, and such assessment be made or tax levied to pay therefor, unless a majority of the property owners in such district shall, by petition to the Common Council, ask for the same, or two-thirds of the members of the Common Council assent thereto, by vote at a regular meeting.\u201d t</p>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">That these sections cast on the city the duty of keeping its sidewalks in repair, wc entertain no doubt. It is to be observed that Section 62 gives the city exclusive control \u201d of the streets, and expressly devolves upon it the function of making \u201c all needful rules in regard to the improvement and repair thereof.\u201d This grant of \u201c exclusive control \u201d implies that control is deemed by the Legislature desirable and necessary for the accommodation of the public, and imposes the duty of exercising that control as far as public convenience and safety may require. The imposition of the duty to make \u201c all needful rules\u201d for the improvement and repair of streets, implies that rules will be needed \u2014that is to say, because public use and welfare will demand <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>such improvements and repairs. We think that the provisions of this section, taken by themselves, impose a manifest duty upon the municipality to keep its streets in repair; and if its streets, then also its sidewalks, for they are a part of its streets.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-4\">Subdivision 25 has been assumed by defendant to qualify \u25a0Sec. 62, and to indicate that the Legislature intended not to \u2022charge the city with any such duty. Defendant bases this assumption upon the supposition, that, according to this subdivision, there can be no repair of a sidewalk, except upon one or the other of two contingences, namely : a petition by a majority of property owners, or a two-thirds vote of the Council. But the language used, as we read it, does not say or import any such thing. It only says, that without such petition or vote there shall in no case a \u201c sidewalk be built,\u201d and an \u201c assessment be made or tax levied to pay therefor.\u201d \u201cTherefor\u201d means <em>for the sidewalk being built. </em>\u201c Built \u201d means <em>constructed. </em>Between building and repairing there is a plain distinction.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">To build a sidewalk in a country town, or in an unfrequented quarter of a city, might be a very inexpedient, because a needless, public work. But if a sidewalk, once built, be not' kept in Tepair, it becomes directly a positive offense to the public, a anan-trap and a nuisance.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-6\">As regards the liability of a city like Olympia to a private action, in a case like this, except by authority of express statute giving the right to sue, there is considerable conflict among the authorities, and many shades of distinction are made in endeavors to reconcile them. The various views are presented, and the cases jjro and con discussed in Dillon on Municipal Corporations, and in the cases of <em>Burns </em>v. <em>The District of Columbia, </em>1 Otto, 540; <em>Hill </em>v. Boston, 122 Mass. 344, and 21 Mich.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-7\">In <em>Burns </em>v. <em>The District cf </em>Columbia, the Supreme Court of the United States declare unequivocally in favor of the liability. It does not seem to us to have been necessary for the decision of that case to have asserted so broad a doctrine; but that the 'Court intended to assert it, and to plant their decision upon it, there can, we think, be no mistake. We regard that decision as binding upon us, and conclusive of this case as to the liability of the city.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-8\">Such being our opinion, we do not think it necessary or wise <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>to consider the question of whether Sections 661 and 662 of the Code do not make all municipal or <em>quasi </em>corporations liable to private action for personal injuries caused by their neglect of \u00abduty owed to the public.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">The decision of the Court below will be reversed, and the \u00abause remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-6\">We concur : S. C. \"Wingard, Associate. Justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-7\">George Turner, Associate Justice.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
