Code of Washington, p. 125. The demurrer does not raise this question. Besides, the statute must be pleaded by answer. (Code of Washington, ec. 25; Van Santvoord\u2019s Pleading by Moak, 3d ed., pp. 206-253; Waite\u2019s N. Y.

The Code of Washington having repealed the provisions of the Practice Act of 1877 (Stats., p. 115, Sec. 555), providing for ad-measurement of dower in actions at law, the remedy was in equity for partition.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b234-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number><em>Elwood Evans, </em>and <em>McNaught, Eerry, McNaught &amp; Mitchell, </em>for Appellees.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b234-4\">Dower was abolished by the law of December 2d, 1869.

It is not such an interest in property as is protected by the Constitution. Mr. Cooley, in. his treatise upon constitutional limitations, defines it to be \u201c only a capacity to acquire a right.\u201d (Cooley\u2019s Con.

(Cooley\u2019s Con. Lim., 2d ed., top p. 364, 365, 366; <em>Parker </em>v. <em>Kane et al., </em>4 Wis. 1; <em>Howell </em>v. <em>Howell, </em>15 Wis. 55; <em>Horbach v.

That plaintiff was married to Stephen H. Hilton, of Pierce county, in this Territory, on the 16th day of September, 1871, and lived with him as his wife until August 19th, 1878, when he died. Plaintiff subsequently was married to one Jerome Hamilton, her present husband.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-4\">2. That at the date of the said marriage, Stephen H, Hilton was seized in fee of the lands described in the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">3. That on July 5th, 1873, said Hilton conveyed the said lands by deed to the defendants, in which said deed the plain\u00bbtiff did not join.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">4. That plaintiff had an estate in dower in the lands aforesaid, which she prays may be assigned, etc., and for general relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-7\">\u2022 To the complaint in this case a general demurrer was filed, which was sustained by the District Court. A final judgment was entered for the defendant, and the plaintiff appeals to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-8\">The important and decisive question in the case is, \u201c Was dower allowed by the law of this Territory at the date of the decease of plaintiff\u2019s husband ? \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b235-9\">It is not questioned that dower as at common law was given to the widow in this Territory, and remained until the somewhat radical legislation of 1869. (Daws of W. T., p. 318.)</p>\n<p id=\"b235-10\">In this last named law, no mention is made whatever of dower, much less is there any expression which in terms abolishes it.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-11\">It is claimed, however, that it abolishes dower by implication. Whether this be so or not, at the next following session of the Legislature \u2014 Act, November 29th, 1871, by Section 23d \u2014 it was enacted that \u201c neither dower or courtesy shall hereafter accrue.\u201d That is to say, that as to all persons living in this Territory at that date, and all who might subsequently abide therein, dower should be abolished. (See 25 Ibid.)</p>\n<p id=\"b235-12\">The plaintiff was then a resident of the Territory. She had then no vested right of dower.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-13\">In the language of Judge Cooley, which we adopt as a correct definition, she had \u201c only a capacity to acquire a right.\u201d It could, therefore, be abolished by legislative enactment, as could an estate in expectancy vested in an ancestor. (Leading Cases Am. Law Real Property, Vol. 1, p. 300.) We are of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>opinion that it was abolished. The judgment of the Court below in sustaining the demurrer is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-4\">We concur. George Turner, Associate Justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">John P. Hoyt, Associate Justice.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
