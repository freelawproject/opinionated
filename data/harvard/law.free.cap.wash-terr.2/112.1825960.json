The judgment relied upon by the defendant was rendered in 1867, but had not been entered in the journal of the Court, nor was there any file-mark upon-it; neither was it attached b}*- any fastening to the papers in the case. The cause had been tried by the Court, a jury being waived. The present Clerk of the \u25a0Court testified, against the objection of the plaintiff, that the findings and judgment entry were in the handwriting of the Judge then presiding; that on taking possession of the clerk\u2019s office, the witness had found the same among the papers in the case; and he also found on the original calendar of such Judge, in the same handwriting, a memorandum to the effect that such judgment had been entered. Others also testified to the handwriting of the Judge. From this evidence, the trial Court found the judgment a valid and subsisting judgment, and that the same was conclusive against the plaintiff, as an adjudication of the title of the premises in dispute.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b121-7\"><em>j\u00fcolph, Bronough, Dolph &amp; Simon, </em>counsel for Plaintiff in error,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ABT\">to the point that the judgment pleaded had not been rendered, cited the following authorities. <em>(Russel </em>v. <em>Armador, </em>2 Cal. 305; <em>McKeon </em>v. <em>McDermott, </em>22 Id. 667; <em>Pierce </em>v. <em>Lynch, </em>88 Ib. 530; <em>Adams </em>v. <em>Nellis, </em>59 Howard\u2019s Practice Rep. 385.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b121-8\">And to the point that no sufficient proof of the alleged judgment had been offered, cited the following : <em>(Casement </em>v. <em>Ringgold, </em>28 Cal. 335, 339; Freeman on Judgments, 3d ed., Secs. 38, 39, 407, 409; 1 Greenleaf\u2019s Evidence, Secs. 501, 502, 508; <em>Croswell </em>v. <em>Byrnes, </em>9 John. 287; <em>Waldon </em>v. <em>Green, </em>4 Wendell, 409; <em>Hall </em>v. <em>Hudson, </em>20 Alabama, 284; <em>Whitney </em>v. <em>Townsend, </em>67 New York, 40, 43.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b121-9\">If plaintiff has any title, it is equitable, and cannot be maintained in ejectment. <em>(Fenn </em>v. <em>Holme, </em>21 Howard, 481; <em>Smith </em>v. <em>McCann, </em>24 Ib. 398; <em>Watkins </em>v.

The Town Site Act is not in words of present grant, and passed title only by patent. Hence noestoppel arises. (Revised Statutes U. S., Secs. 2,383, 2,387, 2,394; <em>Bagnell </em>v.

T., 1863, pages 127, 417; Freeman on Judgments, 3d ed., Sec. 38; <em>McGrath </em>v. <em>Lea </em>Grave, 2 Allen, 443; <em>Hawks </em>v. <em>Davenport, </em>5 Ib. 392; <em>Townsend </em>v. <em>Way, </em>Ib. 427; <em>Park </em>v. <em>Darling, </em>4 Cushing, 197; <em>Pruden </em>v. <em>Alden, </em>23 Pickering, 184; <em>Tillotson </em>v. <em>Warner, </em>3 Gray, 574; <em>Sharp </em>v. <em>Lumley, </em>34 Cal. 611; <em>Lick </em>v. <em>Stockdale, </em>18 Ib. 219; <em>Carland </em>v. <em>Heinborg, </em>2, Oregon, 75; <em>Fish </em>v. <em>Emerson, </em>44 New York, 378; <em>Fairchild et al. </em>v. <em>Keith, </em>29 Ohio State, 156.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b122-6\">The <em>entry </em>of judgment, being a ministerial act, only affects the evidence of its existence, and gives occasion for proof <em>aliunde. (Matthewson </em>v. <em>Houghton, </em>11 Me. 377; <em>Fish </em>v. <em>Emerson, </em>44 New York, 376; <em>Younge </em>v. <em>Broxson, </em>23 Ala. 684; <em>Matthewson\u2019s Admir. </em>v. <em>Grant\u2019s Admir., </em>2 Howard, U.

(Tyler on Ejectment, 563; <em>Carpenter </em>v. <em>Schmidt, </em>26 Cal. 479; <em>Marshall </em>v. Shafter, 32 Ib. 178; <em>Mahoney </em>v. <em>Middleton, </em>41 Ib. 41; <em>Stevens </em>v. <em>Zimmerman, </em>55 Pennsylvania State, 446; <em>Garwood </em>v. <em>Garwood, </em>26 Cal. 493; <em>Doak </em>v. <em>Wiswell, </em>33 Maine, 355.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b123-5\">Plaintiff shows no title or rights acquired since the judgment against his grantor. <em>(Newell </em>v. <em>Carpenter, </em>118 Mass. 411; <em>Mahoney </em>v. <em>Van Winkle, </em>33 Cal. 448; <em>Emerson </em>v. <em>Sansome, </em>41 Ib. 552; <em>Campbell </em>v. <em>Hall, </em>16 N. Y. 579.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b123-6\">Under the Town Site Act, by force of the entry and payment, a trust at once arose in favor of the several occupants, and the issuance of patent operated by relation for their benefit.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b123-7\">Opinion by</p>\n<author id=\"AK\">Greene, Chief Justice.</author>\n<p id=\"b123-8\">Plaintiff sued in the District Court to recover possession of Lot seven in Block thirteen in the City of Walla Walla. He alleged in usual form his ownership in fee, and right to possession, and the wrongful withholding of such possession by defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-9\">Defendant answered, denying plaintiff\u2019s ownership, and affirming that he himself is administrator of one Dennis McCraith, deceased, and that in September, 1886, in a certain suit between defendant\u2019s decedent and plaintiff\u2019s grantor, the title and right to possession of the premises was duly litigated, and was upon such litigation duly adjudged in favor of defendant\u2019s decedent. In his reply, the plaintiff denied the litigation and adjudication alleged in the answer.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-10\">On the trial it appeared, that in the suit mentioned in the answer there had been no judgment regularly recorded; but evidence was adduced competent, and in our opinion sufficient, to prove that such a judgment had actually been rendered. It was in evidence, also \u2014 and about this fact there seems to be no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>dispute \u2014 that a tract of land, including the premises in controversy, was on July 17th, 1865, entered pursuant to statute, by the city of Walla Walla, and the purchase price then paid into the local Land Office. It further appeared in evidence, that on August 4th, 1886, the city deeded the premises to one J. O. Hawthorne, who aftei-wards transmitted the paper title by a chain of conveyance to the plaintiff; and that the patent from the United States was issued to the city July 20th, 1869.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-4\">The Judge who tried the case \u2014 a jury having been waived\u2014 found as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b124-5\">\u201c That on the fourth day of September, 1866, Dennis Mc-Craith brought suit in this Court against J. C. Hawthorne, through whom Robert Eakin, the plaintiff, claims title in this suit; and recovered a judgment in 1867 against said Hawthorne for the identical real estate claimed by the plaintiff Eakin in his complaint in this suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-6\">\u201c As a conclusion of law, I find that the defendant is entitled to a judgment in this case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b124-7\">To the introduction of the'evidence offered to show the former adjudication, and to each of the Judge\u2019s findings, exception was duly taken and allowed. Judgment was given for defendant conformably to the legal finding of the Judge, and this judgment is now brought here for reversal by this writ of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-8\">In making entry of the land, the city acted under the Town Site Act of the 23d of May, 1884 (5 Stat. 657), which was subsequently amended and supplanted by the very similar act of the 2d of March, 1867 (14 Stat. 541). By the entry and payment, and the instant they were consummated, the city of Walla Walla became vested with the legal title to the land. <em>(Hussey </em>v. Smith, 99 U. S. 20-22.) This title it forthwith and thenceforth held \u201c in trust for the several use and benefit of the occupants thereof, according to their respective interests,\u201d and not otherwise. Between plaintiff\u2019s grantor, Hawthorne, and defendant\u2019s decedent, after the passage of title out of the United States, and after the city had deeded to Hawthorne, the question of occupancy and interest was litigated and determined. That determination was in favor of defendant\u2019s decedent, and against Hawthorne,the plaintiff\u2019s grantor. Plaintiff is not here claim- \u25a0 ing any other title than what the city was able to give under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>the Town Site Act, nor any other right to ownership or possession than what his grantor had, or is supposed to have had, at the date of the litigation. The result of the litigation, therefore, bound as privies in estate and l-epresentation the parties now in this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-4\">The Judge\u2019s findings of fact are so meager, that they do not cover all the material issues made by the pleadings. His conclusion of law, therefore, does not flow as a logical sequence from the facts found. But if advantage was to be taken of this, there should have been a motion addressed to the Court below, to make additional findings to meet the omitted issues. It is obvious, upon the undisputed facts and the findings actually made, that the substantial rights of the plaintiff are not affected by the Judge\u2019s inadvertence. We must, therefore, following the rule laid down in Sec. 113 of the Code, direct that the judgment of the District Court be <em>affirmed.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
