If the Divorce Act is valid, does it affect the rights of the divorced wife, under the Donation Law ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b330-6\">We maintain that the Divorce Act is not valid for any purpose, and that it does not purport to affect property rights of the parties, and could not in any event take away or abridge the rights of either party to the benefits of the Donation Law.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b330-7\">The Territoiy' of Oregon was not a sovereignty; its Legislature possessed only <em>delegated </em>powers, and must be limited within the scope of the powers granted in <em>the </em>organic act; the grant of power extends only to <em>rightful subjects of </em>legislation, not inconsistent with the Constitution and laws of the United States. (General Laws of Oregon, p. 24, note 2, and p. 55, Sec. 6, note 1; 9 Statutes at Large, 323; 1 Kent\u2019s Commentaries, 384; Story on the Constitution, Secs. 1324-5; Cooley on Constitutional Limitations, 28, 85, 174; <em>American Insurance Co. </em>v.

To ascertain and declare the existence of sufficient cause in a particular case is not a legislative but a judicial function, and judicial power is not given to the Legislature,.but is vested in the Courts by the organic act; therefore, the marriage relation of particular individuals is not a <em>rightful subject of legislation. </em>(Story on Conflict of Laws, Secs. 108, 200: 2 Kent\u2019s Commentaries, pp. 76, 105, note C, 106, 118, note 3; 1 Kent\u2019s Commentaries, 291, 448; Schouler on Domestic Relations, 22, 205; 1 Bishop on Marriage and Divorce, 5th ed., Secs. 35, 689; Cooley on Constitutional Limitations, 6, 87, 90, 91, 95, 174, 175, 188, 391, 109, 113, 114, note 3; General Laws of Oregon, 56, Sec. 8; 9 Statutes at Large, 323; Story on the Constitution, 4th ed., Sec. 1397 and note, Sec. 1592; <em>Clark v.

Maynard, at the time of the passage of the act, was not within the Territory of Oregon; and being separated from her husband, in fact, without her fault, she was not affected by his change of domicile, but remained as he left her, domciled in Ohio. Such being the case, the act passed without notice to her, and without her consent, is void as to her. (Cooley on Constitutional Limitations, 128; Story on Conflict of Laws, Secs. 20, 539; 2 Kent\u2019s Commentaries, 117, notes; 2 Bishop on M. and D., Sec. 128 a; Freeman on Judgments, Sec. 582; <em>Maguire </em>v. <em>Maguire, </em>7 Dana, 181; <em>Cheever </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>9 Wallace, 108; <em>Pennoyer </em>v. <em>Neff, </em>5 Otto, 722; <em>Cheely </em>v. <em>Clayton, </em>110 United States, 701; <em>People </em>v. <em>Baker, 76 </em>New York, 78.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b331-7\">Under the peculiar circumstances of this case, the divorce was a gross fraud upon a blameless woman, and for that reason void. (Bishop on M. and D., Sec. 687.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b331-8\">The marital rights of persons are rights resting upon a contract in which the parties have pecuniary interests; and the Donation Law is an offer made by the Government of a reward for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>valuable services, and upon acceptance of the offer there is a Talid and binding contract between the Government and the settler under its provisions. To such a contract the wife of a married settler is also a party; and a law which has the effect to \u2022defeat her of her rights under the contract is a law impairing the obligations of a contract; therefore, the Divorce Act is in conflict with Section 10, Article 1, of the Constitution of the United States, and with the Ordinance of 1787, which is expressly incorporated into the organic law of Oregon Territory. (General Laws of Oregon, p. 59; Story on Conflict of Laws, Sec. 108; Story on the Constitution, Sec. 1394; 1 Bouvier\u2019s Law Dictionary, 513; <em>Van Dolf v. Otis, </em>1 Oregon, 153; <em>Murray </em>v. <em>Murray, </em>6 Oregon, 26; <em>Stark </em>v. <em>Starrs, </em>6 Wallace, 408; <em>Vance v. Burbank, </em>11 Otto, 520.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b332-5\">Section 6 of the organic law of Oregon Territory expressly forbids the passage by the Territorial Legislature of any law interfering with the primary disposal of the soil; and any law which directly or indirectly has the effect to interfere with the \u25a0operation of the land laws of Congress is, therefore, void. For this reason, whatever effect may be given to the Divorc\u00e9 Act in other respects, it cannot cut off nor abridge the rights of Lydia A. Maynard or her heirs under the Donation Law. <em>(Hall v. Russell, </em>11 Otto, 514; <em>Crandall v. Nevada, </em>6 Wallace, 35; <em>Henderson v. Mayor of New York, </em>2 Otto, 268; <em>Tobelman v. Packard, </em>109 United States, 421; Railroad Tax Cases, 13 Federal Reporter, 731; 18 Central Law Journal, 320.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b332-6\">The Donation Law is a benevolent statute in favor of a deserving class, and its provisions are to be liberally construed; no aiew conditions or limitations upon the rights of the donees are to be incorporated into it by construction. The law provides that the quantity of land g-ranted to the settler, if married, or if lie shall become married within one year from the first day of December, 1850, shall be double the quantity granted to a single man, and one half to a. wife in her own right; the grant to married settlers, therefore, depends upon the existence of the marriage relation at a particular time, viz: the date of the act, <em>or </em>any time thereafter, and within one year from the first day of December, 1850, and does not depend upon the continuance of the marriage relation. (9 Statutes at Large, p. 496; <em>Stark </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>v. <em>Starr, </em>6 Wallace, 402; <em>Silver </em>v. <em>Ladd, </em>7 Wallace, 225; <em>Meek &amp; Luelling </em>v. <em>United States, </em>1 Copp\u2019s Land Owner, p. 21; <em>Davenport v. Lamb, </em>13 Wallace, 418; 10 Opinions of Attorney General, 381.)</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b333-5\"><em>Smith &amp; Jacobs, </em>for Appellees.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b333-6\">Opinion by</p>\n<author id=\"AWa\">Hoyt, Associate Justice.</author>\n<p id=\"b333-7\">The Court below sustained a demurrer to the complaint filed in this action, and rendered judgment in favor of defendants, from which judgment plaintiffs appealed, and have brought the case here for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-8\">Upon the facts stated in the complaint, plaintiffs were entitled to recover the lands in controversy, unless the special act of the Legislature of the Territory of Oregon declaring the bonds of matrimony between David S. Maynard and Lydia A. Maynard to be dissolved, has had the effect to deprive her of the benefits she would otherwise have been entitled to under the Donation Law of the United States. The case therefore involves two questions, viz: 1st, Was said act of the Legislature valid for any purpose ? and, 2d, If valid, did it affect the rights of the divorced wife under said Donation Law ?</p>\n<p id=\"b333-9\">The first inquiry, then, is as to the power of said Legislature to pass a special act of divorce ; for this power being conceded, the fact that it did pass such an act will raise a conclusive presumption that it was rightfully passed, and that just cause therefor was shown to the satisfaction of the said Legislature; and therefore the allegation of the complaint that no such cause in fact existed, is simply a conclusion of law inconsistent with the facts stated in the complaint, and cannot avail plaintiffs. Had such Legislature the power to pass such special act ? If it had the power to dissolve the bonds of matrimony at all, it must do so by special act, as from the nature of the legislation it must be special and not general.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-10\">The said Legislature is given full power (subject to certain restrictions not pertinent to this discussion) to legislate upon all rightful subjects not inconsistent, with the Constitution and laws of the United States. We will first enquire as to whether such a law was upon a rightful subject of legislation, and then as to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>its being contrary to any provision of the Constitution or laws of the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">The word rightful, as used in the Organic Act of said Territory, is, in our opinion, substantially equivalent to the word lawful; and Congress, by its use, intended only to prohibit legislation that was wrongful in a legal sense, and not necessarily all that might be offensive to the highest standard of moral ethics.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-6\">At the time said act was passed, was it lawful for legislative bodies not restricted by any constitutional provisions to pass acts of divorce, and were such acts legal and of effect ?</p>\n<p id=\"b334-7\">That must be considered as legal and binding which is recognized and enforced by the Courts; and if this be so, then in 1852, when this act was passed, such acts, examined in the light of all the adjudications upon that subject, must be held to be legal and within the legislative power ; and this, too, despite the fact that the power of government under which such acts had been passed and said adjudications had, had been by the sovereign power distributed into the legislative, executive, and judicial branches. This proposition is so fully established by the text writers upon the subject and the cases by them cited, that a simple reference to some of them will suffice to show it; though it is clear from what is said by most of them that, upon moral grounds, they regretted that such had been and was the course of decision upon the subject. (See 1st Bishop on Marriage and l)ivorce, 664; Cooley Const. Lim.,4th ed., 132; 2d Kent\u2019s Com. 98, 105.)</p>\n<p id=\"b334-8\">Besides, theexistence of'this power as a part of the legislative branch of Government has been so well understood, that nearly all of the State Constitutions have, by express provision, restrained their Legislatures from exercising this power; and while this fact may tend to show that the exercise of it was not approved by the moral sentiment of such States, we think that it likewise tends clearly to show that in the absence of such restrictions, its exercise would be lawful, and sustained by the Courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-9\">The passage of the act in question was, then, a rightful-subject of legislation.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-10\">If this act was inconsistent with the Constitution or laws of the United States, it is because the marriage relation is a con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>tract, such as the said Constitution and laws intended to protect from impairment.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">And it has been so often decided that such relation is a status rather than a contract, and that the vested rights therein, if any, must yield to the public interest in the regulation and control of such status, and the opinions therein rendered have been so numerous and able, that we content ourselves with a reference to a few of such decisions, from which it will appear that the marriage relation is not a contract, within the meaning of the \u25a0constitutional restrictions above referred to. (See <em>Butler </em>v. Penn, 10 How. 302, 416; <em>Adams </em>v. <em>Palmer, </em>51 Maine, 480; 1 Bishop on Marriage and Divorce, Secs. 2, 19, 667, 669; Cooley Const. Lim. 134; <em>Brigham </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>17 Ohio, 445.)</p>\n<p id=\"b335-6\">Besides, we think that the fact that Congress nullified certain acts of this nature, and did not, when its attention was thus \u25a0called to the subject, change the general law as to the territoral legislation in the premises, tends strongly to show that in its \u25a0opinion such acts were lawful and of full effect, unless set aside by it, under its power of supervision over all of the laws of the Territories.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-7\">But it is said that the wife was never domiciled in the said Territory of Oregon, and consequently said act can have no effect upon her or her rights ; but with this claim we cannot agree, for if we admit that under the facts pleaded she was domiciled in the State of Ohio, still as the husband was a resident of said Territory, the Legislature could regulate his status therein; and having released him from the bonds' of his marriage, he was, at least while in said Territory, absolved from all its duties, and deprived of all its rights, and from the time he was thus released he occupied the status of a single, and not that of a married man ; and the wife could not come here and assert any right as .such wife thereafter.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-8\">Did the wife, at the time said act was passed, have such a vested right in her half of said Donation Claim as would continue to her, notwithstanding its passage ? We think not; as it is now .the settled law that no title passes to such donation claimants, until the settlement and cultivation required by law have been fully completed. (See <em>Hall </em>v. <em>Russell, </em>101 U. S. 503.)</p>\n<p id=\"b335-9\">Her rights, therefore, were simply contingent; liable to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>defeated by the acts of the husband, and in no sense so vested as to be protected from legislative interference.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">Besides, the facts pleaded show that as to her half of said claim there never was any compliance with the requirements of said Donation Law; as after said divorce the status of her former husband was that of a single and not of a married man, his residence and cultivation could only serve to complete title to his half of said claim; and as there never was any other settlement or cultivation, it follows that her half has never been earned, but remained the property of the United States, and was properly disposed of as such.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-6\">For a more elaborate discussion of the questions involved in-this case, we refer to and approve the opinion of this Court by its Chief Justice, in the case of <em>Maynard </em>v. Valentine, 2 Wash. Territory, 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-7\">Let a decree be entered here, as in the Court below, dismiss-\u2019 ing the complaint, and for costs in favor of the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-8\">I concur: George Turner, Associate Justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-9\">It does not appear, except inferentially, that I dissented from the decision in the case of <em>Maynard </em>v. Valentine, 1 Washington Territory, 3; but I did dissent therefrom, and I dissent from the majority opinion in this case.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
