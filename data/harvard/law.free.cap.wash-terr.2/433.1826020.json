The other alleged defect in these notices is, that there <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>is no sufficient description of the property to entitle said liens to be enforced as against the defendants who appeared in the cause, who were incumbrancers of the property against which said lienors were seeking to enforce their liens.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-3\">The notices were not exactly alike, and if we find any of them sufficient, the demurrer must be overruled. We will therefore investigate that of Ballard &amp; Sox, which was conceded on the argument to be the best one of the four.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-4\">This notice sets out that they furnished materials used in the construction of seven certain dwelling houses, situated on said lots five and six, upon which there was due and unpaid the sum of $79.5(3 ; and claims a lien therefor \u201c in the proportion aforesaid,\u201d to wit: $12.74 upon each of the seven houses ; the words \u201c proportion aforesaid \u201d having, however, nothing in the notice upon which it could be predicated, unless it was the statement that the said seven houses, were of about the same size. And there is nowhere in said notice an allegation that of the materials furnished $12.74 worth, or any other certain amount, went into any particular one of said houses, excepting a repetition towards the close thereof of the words \u201c in the proportion aforesaid.\u201d And we do not think this loose statement sufficient to show that, of the said materials, any particular amount went into any one of said houses, and without such an allegation there is no foundation for the claim of lien. In order to make said lien claim of $12.74 enforcable against any or each of said houses, it should at least appear by direct averment that that particular amount of material had gone into the particular house in question, and was unpaid for, and that a lien was claimed therefor; and should further contain a description of the property upon which such house was situated, sufficient for identification ; and to say that a particular house is one of seven, all of which are situated on two certain lots, is no designation at all as to the location of said particular house, as there is nothing tending even to show as to which of said lots it is upon.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">If the claimant had set out in his notice that he furnished said material as a single transaction for the building of the seven houses, and that they were all built as substantially one building, and claimed a lien on the whole thereof for his entire claim, a different question would have been presented; but he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>saw fit to claim seven distinct liens of $12.74 each, and in order to sustain such lien on any one house, there must be such direct averments as would make such claim good if it stood alone, unconnected with the claims against the other houses. Of course, some cf the statements could be grouped, but it must clearly appear that the lien for the sum of $12.74 claimed upon any \u25a0one house is for that amount of unpaid-for materials used in the \u25a0construction thereof; and said notice must further contain a definite description of that particular house, so as to identify it not only with all the others, but also from all the others.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-4\">Wo have already seen that the most liberal construction of this notice will fail to make of any averment therein, even substantially, a statement of these necessary facts. It follows that the notices were void, and that the action of the Court in sustaining the demurrer to the complaint was correct, and that the \u2022decree rendered thereon must be affirmed, and it is so ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">We concur: S. C. Wingard, Associate Justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-6\">George Turner, Associate Justice.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
