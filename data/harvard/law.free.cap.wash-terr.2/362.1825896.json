I. \u201c That any person desiring to remove a cause from any District Court of Washington Territory may do so, either in person or by his attorney of record, and in the following manner:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b371-6\">\u201c Such person or attorney may give notice in open Court, or at \u25a0chambers, that he appeals such cause to the Supreme Court of the Territory. Such notice shall, by order of the Court or Judge having jurisdiction of the cause, be entered in the journal of such Court, and no other service or notice of process shall be required ; and, thereupon, the Clerk of such Court shall make and. certify a full and complete transcript of said cause, including the journal entries thereunto appertaining, and cause such transcript to be filed with the Clerk of the Supreme Court within the time allowed by law ; and, thereupon, the Supreme Court shall have complete and perfect jurisdiction of such cause.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b371-7\">Seo.

Such assignment of errors shall be substantially the same as that provided for in Section 458 of the Code, and a copy thereof shall be served on the adverse party or his attorney within twenty days after the entry in the journal of the District Court of the notice of appeal. No formal joinder in error shall be required, but such joinder will be deemed made upon the errors assigned.\u201d'</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b372-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>Several months later, this cause, which is an action at law, was appealed from the District Court at Walla Walla, under said Act of 1883.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b372-5\">A motion was made to dismiss the appeal, because no assignment of errors had been served on the appellee within twenty days after the entry of the notice of appeal on the journal of the District Court.

Again, to dismiss this case upon the ground that the assignment of errors was not filed within the strict time provided by the rule, would be depriving the plaintiff of having the cause heard upon the merits. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>defendant in error has not suffered, or had any of his rights put in jeopardy. The grounds upon which he asks a dismissal are purely technical. The assignment of errors was made in ample time to give him full knowledge of the points upon which plaintiff in error would rely, and his attorney accepted service of the assignment after it was filed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b373-5\">An acceptance of service of the assignment of errors was a waiver of any default or <em>laches </em>on the part of the plaintiff in \u25a0error. <em>(Hestres\u2019 Administrator </em>v. Clements, 21 Cal. 425; 1 Wait\u2019s Pr., 557, 660-662; 2 Id., 521; 3 Estee\u2019s Pl. 40.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b373-6\">Opinion by</p>\n<author id=\"A_s\">Greene, Chief Justice.</author>\n<p id=\"b373-7\">This cause has been brought here under the provisions of the Appeal Act of 1883, which allow all cases of whatever jurisdiction to be taken to this Court by the simple service of a notice of appeal given and entered in the lower Court. The uniformity of mode of procedure prescribed by that act does not do away with the essential distinctions between causes at law and causes in equity, for purposes of review. Rule Y. of this Court, in view of these distinctions, and to facilitate the business of the Court, and to harmonize the appellate practice under the Act of 1883 with that under the Code, has provided in substance that in all law causes brought up under the Act of 1883 an assignment of errors shall be made in writing, and filed with the clerk of the proper District Court, to be certified to this Court as a part of the record; and that a copy of such assignment shall be served on the adverse party within twenty days after the entry in the journal of the District Court of the notice of appeal. Plaintiff in error did not serve a copy of assignment of errors in this cause within the time limited, and on that ground defendant in error moves to dismiss the appeal. No good reason for denying the motion appears. Doubtless, Rule Y., ever since its adoption, has been part of the law applicable to suitors in this Court, without regard to when it was first published in print.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-8\">Let the motion to dismiss the appeal be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-9\">We concur: John P.
