The Court committed no error in admitting the testimony -of Jamieson, as stated in the first assignment of error.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b264-8\">The plaintiff had a right to show a subsequent agreement as to the place of payment. <em>(Stearns </em>v. <em>Hall, </em>9 Cushing, 31; <em>Bakers </em>v. <em>Whitesides, </em>12 Am.

(1 Greenleaf on Evidence, Redfield\u2019s edition, Secs. 99, 100.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b264-11\">Sweeney accepted the money paid to Brandt, and subsequently on three several occasions called at Jamieson\u2019s office and received money under the contract in the same way that Brandt had agreed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b264-12\">Under the circumstances testified to, the plaintiff had a right to make the tender to Bunce for Sweeney.

Plaintiff had a right to procure brick at the nearest available place. (Sedgwick on the Measure of Damages, 5th ed., p. 310, note 1; <em>Grand Tower Company </em>v. <em>Phillips, </em>23 Wallace, 479, 480; Benjamin on Sales, 23d ed., Sec. 879, note f.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b265-5\">The defendant did not raise the objection at the trial, that Pruisse\u2019s testimony was incompetent, but that it was \u201c irrelevant and immaterial.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b265-6\">There is a wide distinction between the two. (1 Greenleaf on Evidence, Redfield\u2019s edition, 2, 51 a.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b265-7\">We object to any discussion on the question of incompetency.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b265-8\">However, such testimony is held to be competent and relevant.

The appellant, who was tlie defendant below, answered, as a defense to the complaint, a prior breach of the contract on the part of the appellees, in failing to pay for brick as they were delivered, and a release upon his part thereby from obligation to further comply with the contract. Numerous questions upon the introduction of testimony for and against this defense arose in the Court below, and exceptions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>were reserved to the rulings of the Court thereon, and to instructions given by the Court to the jury concerning defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-4\">We find no error in said rulings or instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">We think, however, that there was no evidence in the case to warrant a verdict for the full amount recovered by appellees.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-6\">The damages claimed in the complaint were:</p>\n<p id=\"b266-7\">1. The difference between the purchase price of the brick, which was procured to furnish the building after the breach by the appellant, and the contract price under the contract with, appellant. ,</p>\n<p id=\"b266-8\">2. Damage to the appearance and finish of the- building, caused by appellant\u2019s failure to furnish pressed or faced brick with which to finish the front of the building, thus rendering it necessary for the appellees to finish the front of the building-with common brick.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-9\">According to the testimony of appellees, they purchased fifty-seven thousand additional brick with which to finish their building after the default of the appellant, paying $13.50 per thousand for forty thousand, and $15.50 per thousand for the-additional seventeen thousand. As the contract price with the appellant was $9 per thousand, it needs but a simple computation to show that the damage under this head was in the neighborhood of $300.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-10\">The verdict against appellant was for $800. The excess over $300, therefore, must have been for a damage to the appearance and finish of the building, caused by the use of common brick in the finish of the front of the building. This defect in the building was a proper subject for the computation of damage, if the evidence on the trial had disclosed that it was the necessary result of the breach of the contract by the appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-11\">The evidence, however, shows no more than that the appellees, when they found that the appellant would furnish no more pressed brick, changed their plans as to the finish of the front of the building, and concluded to finish it with common brick. It does not show an inability to procure pressed brick from other persons in Spokane Falls, at the same or a less price than they had agreed to pay the appellant. On the contrary, it shows affirmatively that they failed to make inquiries on the subject before changing their plan of construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>Under these circumstances, they were not entitled to have a verdict from the jury for damage caused by the change. The damages, therefore, were excessive, and the motion for a new trial based upon that ground should have been granted, unless the appellees had remitted the excess.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-5\">No offer to remit having been made in this Court, the judgment of the Court below is reversed, and the cause remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-6\">\u00a5e concur: John B. Hoyt, Associate Justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-7\">Boger S. Greene, Chief Justice.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
