McCoy, deceased, sued the plaintiff in error and Margaret A. McCoy (the plaintiff in error alone served and defending), for the alleged conversion of property of said estate of the value of twenty thousand, two hundred dollars, and recovered a judgment for three thousand, two hundred and forty-three dollars and fifteen cents, and costs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b211-12\">The recovery was for the conversion of negotiable railroad stocks and notes ; the stock being of a railroad in Walia Walia County, and the notes secured by mortgages on real property and real estate in said county.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b211-13\">The pleadings admit that deceased, Thomas K. McCoy, died \u25a0on the 19th of February, 1877, and said notes and stocks be' longed to his estate.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b211-14\">The issues made are :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b211-15\">Whether deceased, at the time of his death, had his domicil in the county of Umatilla, State of Oregon, or in the county of Walla Walla, Territory of Washington.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b211-16\">Whether the assets which defendant is charged with converting were at said time located in the county of Umatilla, State of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>Oregon, or in the county of Walla Walla, Territory of Washington.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b212-5\">Whether the Probate Court ever had jurisdiction of said assets.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b212-6\">Whether defendant, as administrator of said estate in Oregon, had said property vested in him by a decree of the Oregon Court; and whether, if so vested, it was rightful for defendant to sell the stock and collect the notes.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b212-7\">Whether any property in said assets vested in the Administrator of Washington Territory.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b212-8\"><em>T.

McCoy, deceased, in Umatilla Connty.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b212-10\">As proof that, in collecting said debts and selling said stocks, they were acting as administrators rightfully, the defendant at the trial offered in evidence a duly certified copy of the County Court of Umatilla County, State of Oregon, which appears in the transcript in connection with the printed Code of the State of Oregon.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b212-11\">The domicile of deceased is the <em>situs </em>of all his personal property, and an administrator at that place becomes vested with the title to such property, so that when once so vested, he may follow such property into another State, and recover the same in his own personal right. This rule includes all negotiable property which the administrator might'sell at the domicile, and all other debts which ho can collect without suit, without fraud upon creditors in another State.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b212-12\">There are some authorities which hold that when such deceased has creditors in a foreign State, and owes on non-negotiable debts,- an administrator in such foreign State may be appointed, and seize such debts to pay the said creditors, and remit the balance to the administrator of the domicile.

It follows that the proceedings recited in said transcript were not void, and it was error to exclude them for that reason. Defendants in error, however, strongly insist that such error could not have prejudiced the rights of the plaintiff in error, as said transcript did not tend to prove or disprove any of the issues in the case. But we think it did; as one of the issues was as to whether at a certain date certain notes and other specific articles of property were in Walla Walla County, or in said Umatilla County; and in our opinion the fact that said transcript showed that at said date the Probate Court of Umatilla County had assumed jurisdiction over said articles, and was proceeding against them as within its control, would <em>prima facie </em>establish <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>the fact that they were then within the said County of Umatilia, and within the jurisdiction of said Probate Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-4\">The transcript, then, should have been admitted in evidence, \u2022and its exclusion was error; for which the judgment must be reversed and a new trial granted, and it is so ordered.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
