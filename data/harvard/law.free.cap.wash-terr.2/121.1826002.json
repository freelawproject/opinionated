W. Hartley and one Theodore F. Barnes, of Nebraska, for the sale of what is commonly known as \u201c Soldiers\u2019 Additional Homestead Scrip \u201d ; but of which alleged agency defendants in error claimed entire ignorance, and, on the contrary, produced numerous letters and writings, tending to show that he held himself forth as the owner of the scrip in which he dealt. This scrip purported to be written evidence of the right granted by Congress to every private soldier or officer who served in the army of the United States for ninety days during the recent rebellion, who was honorably discharged therefrom, had remained loyal to the United States ever since that time, and who had, prior <em>to </em>the 8th day of June, 1872, entered under the homestead laws of the United States a quantity of land less than one hundred and sixty acres, to enter, as a homestead, sufficient land to make one hundred and sixty acres when added to that already entered.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b129-11\">The homestead right of each claimant was represented by a separate set of papers, consisting of, first, a certificate from the Begister of a United States Land Office, that the soldier named therein had an original homestead, describing it; second, an application by the original claimant for an additional homestead <em>; </em>third, an affidavit of the original claimant, stating that he had made application for an additional homestead, giving the number of the application ; and that said application was made for his own exclusive benefit, and not directly or indirectly for the ben<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>efit of any other person whatsoever; fourth, an affidavit of the original claimant as to the length of his service in the army; fifth, a certified copy of his discharge; sixth, a power of attorney executed by the original claimant, authorizing the person therein named to enter the additional homestead in the name of the claimant, and receive the duplicate certificate and patent therefor ; seventh, a power of attorney executed by the original claimant, and in terms irrevocable, authorizing the person therein named to enter the additional homestead of such claimant in his name, and to sell the same and execute deeds thereof.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b130-4\">The plaintiff in error informed the defendants in error, who were engaged in the lumber business at Port Blakely, that he had this scrip for sale. This gave rise to a correspondence between the parties, which resulted in the defendants in error ordering of the plaintiff in error scrip for one thousand acres, two hundred and forty to be delivered to one \"W. B. Moore.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b130-5\">The scrip was delivered to Moore, with the exception of one piece, returned to plaintiff in error, and is not in controversy in this case.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b130-6\">At the time of delivery of the scrip, the applications for additional homesteads and powers of attorney were executed in blank \u2014 that is to say, none of the applications stated its number or date, or the land office where it was to be made, or described the land to be entered; and none of the powers of attorney stated the name of the attorney, the land office where the entry was to be made, or described the land to be entered. The scrip was purchased by defendants in error as a medium for acquiring timber land for logging purposes; and to make it serviceable for such use they caused the blanks t.o be filled accordingly ; and having inserted the names of some of their own employees as attorneys for the original claimants, about the 18th day of March, 1876, presented it at the Land Office at Olympia, in order to enter the land. The entry, however, was at once re-, fused, and the scrip rejected, on account of the alleged spurious character of the signatures of the officers before whom the affidavits were taken and the powers of attorney acknowledged, as claimed by plaintiffs in error; but according to the claim of the defendants in error, it was rejected because of instructions from the General Land Office, and was afterwards rejected as spurious by the Commissioner of the General Land Office.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b131-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>In January, 1879, after the return of the scrip to defendant in error, it was tendered to plaintiff in error, and being refused, action was commenced for the purchase price.

This complaint the defendant, who is here plaintiff in error, saw fit to answer without demurring. Issues of fact were made, and a trial had before the Judge. Findings of fact and. judgment, following in due course, were for plaintiff. In bringing their action, the plaintiffs sought to recover back an amount paid by them upon a contract to purchase what goes by the name of \u201c Soldiers\u2019 Additional Homestead Scrip.\u201d Their complaint in substance declares that defendant contracted to sell them, at an agreed price, certain Soldiers\u2019 Additional Homestead Scrip, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>\u25a0 which was afterwards duly delivered, and for which the price agreed was paid, but which turned out to be forged and valueless. It is now urged in this Court, that the complaint does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action, since it appears, on the face of it, that the contract set up attempted to effect a sale which could not be made without contravening public policy. By the phrase \u201c Soldiers\u2019 Additional Homestead Scrip,\u201d no other scrip can be understood than such as purports to carry a soldier\u2019s right to make and perfect entries of land under Section 2306, and connected sections of the United States Revised Statutes. Equally clear it is, that, under those sections, the right to make such entries and take the benefit of them belongs to the soldier himself alone, and that it is against the plain intent and policy of Congress for any one to negotiate to transfer it.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-4\">For ordinary cases the rule is well settled, that no action can be maintained upon an agreement contrary to the policy of the law. This rule has exceptions. An exception occurs, where the contract has been entered into under circumstances of mistake or misrepresentation, or where the party plaintiff is decidedly the less to blame. Of such circumstances, a Court of Equity would take cognizance, and in a fit case grant relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">Here, the complaint puts forward nothing but a supposed contract, an execution of it on plaintiff\u2019s part, and a total failure of consideration on defendants\u2019 \u2014 nothing, in fact, but what purports to be a mere legal cause of action. Possibly it might be amended, so as to show a state of affairs deserving of equitable redress; but as it stands, it lacks the facts essential to a good pleading.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-6\">Persuaded of this, we do not need to express an opinion upon questions arising out of anything later in the cause. The judgment of the District Court will be reversed, and the cause remanded to that Court, with directions to vacate all proceedings subsequent to the amended complaint and to dismiss the cause, unless the plaintiffs, within such reasonable time and upon such terms as that Court may fix, shall so amend their complaint as to show themselves <em>prima facie </em>entitled to recover.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
