D. 1882, Wells, Fargo <em>&amp; </em>Company applied to the Judge of the District Court holding terms at New Tacoma for, and obtained, an <em>ex parte </em>interlocutory injunction against the Northern Pacific Eailroad Company. The order granted enjoined the Northern Pacific Eailroad Company,, its agents, servants and employees, from ejecting Wells, Fargo &amp; Company\u2019s messengers and express matter off the road of said defendant, then constructed and operated. It commanded the said Northern Pacific Eailroad Company to receive upon and carry Wells, Fargo <em>&amp;\u25a0 </em>Company\u2019s express messengers and express matter over the said Company\u2019s then unconstructed road, when the same should be thereafter constructed and operated. At that time, the defendant\u2019s road was not constructed through Montana, east of Missoula.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b311-14\">This <em>ex parte </em>order was mandatory, in so far as it applied <em>tO' </em>the then unconstructed portion of defendant\u2019s road. Immediately after the granting of said injunction, notice was served upon the defendant, and the defendant moved the Court to dissolve or .modify said order.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b311-15\">On the 1st of September, 1883, the Court modified said order, so as to require the Northern Pacific Eailroad Company to car<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>\u00a1ry Wells, Fargo &amp; Company\u2019s express messengers and express matter within the limits covered by its then operated road, that is to say, from Puget Sound, in Washington Territory, to Missoula, in Montana Territory.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b312-4\">On the 4th of September, 1888, the said Court, without notice to said railroad company, suspended the order made by \u00abaid Court on the 1st day of September, 1883, until the further hearing by the Court thereon; and on said 4th day of September, Wells, Fargo <em>&amp; </em>Company appealed to this Court from the order of'said Court modifying said original restraining order; and, on said day, said Northern Pacific Eailroad Company appealed to said Supreme Court from the order of said Court refusing to dissolve said injunction entirely, and also from the order of said Court suspending said order.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b312-5\">After said appeals as aforesaid had been taken, and while \u00abaid matters were pending in said Supreme Court, Wells, Fargo <em>&amp; </em>Company moved the Court to reinstate the original restraining order; and, thereafter, in April, 1884, the Judge of said \u2022Court did reinstate said original restraining order. From this order said Northern Pacific Eailroad Company duly appealed <em>to </em>this Court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b312-6\">Counsel for Wells, Fargo &amp; Company moved the Court to dismiss the appeal of the Northern Pacific Eailroad Company, and also the cross appeal of Wells, Fargo <em>&amp; </em>Co., for two reasons. First, that the statutes of the Territory did not authorize an appeal from an interlocutory order. Second, that under the Organic Act an appeal can be allowed from a final judgment only.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b312-7\">The motion was allowed, and the cause dismissed, and upon a, rehearing the Court affirmed its judgment of dismissal.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b312-8\">McNaught, <em>Ferry, McNaught &amp; </em>Mitchell, for N.

But owing to the peculiar-constitution of the Supreme Court of this Territory, as it now exists, and to the unsettled state which would obtain as to the practice in the Territory if we were to hold that appeals will lie in cases like-the one under consideration, and the other two members of said Court hold the contrary, we have come to the conclusion that the public interests will be best subserved if we treat this question as <em>stare decisis, </em>and allow the rule established by the case of <em>McCormick </em>v. <em>The W. W. &amp; C. R. R., </em>1st Wash. Ty. Reports, 512, to stand as the settled law of the Territory.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">I concur: George Turner, Associate Justice.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
