L. Taylor.\u201d Each party instituted an action, but the two were consolidated for trial. The collision occurred off Cape Flattery, about the hour of nine o\u2019clock in the forenoon. Preceding the collision, the <em>\u201c </em>Ranier \u201d was sailing in a westerly course, and the \u201c Taylor \u201d in a southeasterly, with the wind southerly.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b101-18\">A large mass of evidence was introduced at the trial, tending to show the relative positions of the vessels at and immediately <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>prior to the collision; the movements or want of action of the vessels, respectively; the direction, rate, and character of the wind ; the observance, or lack of seamanship, in the different contingencies shown; and in brief, the numerous circumstances and factors that, on the one hand, tended to show fault, or on the other, to show care.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b102-4\">In addition to the testimony of those aboard the vessels at the time, the evidence of numerous experts was made use of; numerous authorities were cited by the respective counsel in support of different conclusions, claimed to be the result from established propositions of fact, which cannot aptly be reported without devoting more space to a statement of parts of the evidence than the opinion rendered warrants.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b102-5\"><em>J.

L. Taylor \u2019* and the bark \u201cEanier,\u201d off Cape Flattery, near the mouth of the straits Juan de Fuca. The bark was owned by the Puget Sound Commercial Company.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-6\">Actions for damages, civil and maritime, were brought by both parties ; the causes were, consolidated, and both parties appeal to this Court from the judgment of the Court below. The testimony of the officers and crews of the two vessels is conflicting, and the expert testimony, being largely hypothetical, is unsatisfactory. On a careful review of the whole case, we are convinced that the findings of the District Court are correct. They are as follows :</p>\n<p id=\"b104-7\">\u201c The damages suffered by the two vessels respectively, including demurrage, were as follows : By the \u201c Eanier,\u201d $4,000 ; by the \u201c Taylor,\u201d $5,000. Both vessels were guilty of contributory faults.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-8\"><em>\u201c 1st. The </em>Eanier \u2019 was in fault for passing as close as she did astern. of the \u2018 Taylor,\u2019 while the wind was baffling and variable, and the \u2018 Taylor \u2019 was in stays.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-9\">\u201c 2d. The \u2018 Eanier \u2019 was in' fault for not keeping a man at her helm, and for not using great diligence to keep, herself under control, while in the immediate neighborhood of the \u2018 Taylor.\u2019 '</p>\n<p id=\"b104-10\">\u201c 3d. The Taylor \u2019 was in fault for trying to pass astern of the \u2018 Eanier \u2019 while she saw that the latter was caught aback, and that the wind would tend to drift her under the former\u2019s bows.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-11\">\u201c 4th. The \u2018 Taylor \u2019 was in fault for not luffing when she approached the <em>\u2018 </em>Eanier,\u2019 and found that the latter was n aking sternway, and was unmanageable.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-12\">\u201c 5th. The \u2018 Eanier \u2019 was in fault for not recovering command of herself sooner.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>\u201c 6th. The \u2018 Taylor \u2019 was in fault for not beginning to lower her sails the instant it was clearly inevitable that the vessels must come together.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">\u201c 7th. The \u2018 Ranier \u2019 was in fault for not cutting her main topmast backstay-lanyards as soon as it was evident that the <em>* </em>Taylor\u2019s\u2019 foreyard was held fast by them.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-6\">\u201c Such loss as has been sustained should be -divided between both.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-7\">\u201c A decree should be rendered in favor of the Taylor \u2019 for $500.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b105-8\">The judgment of the Court below is affirmed. Costs being -entirely within the discretion of the Court, those made in this Court will be equally divided between the parties.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
