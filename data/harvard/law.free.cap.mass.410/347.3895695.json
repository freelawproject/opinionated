Following a bench trial and a jury-waived trial de novo, the order was confirmed. In 1988, the department issued another order extending commitment. See G. L. c. 120, \u00a7 19 (1988 ed.) (requiring new order within two years). The order was confirmed after a bench trial in the West Roxbury Division of the District Court Department, the original committing court. The defendant sought a jury trial de novo in the appellate session of the Juvenile Court Department. See G. L. c. 120, \u00a7 20 (1988 ed.). A jury found beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant was dangerous by reason of mental illness, and confirmed the department\u2019s order extending commitment of the defendant. A judge of the Juvenile Court confirmed the order in accordance with the jury verdict. This appeal by the defendant challenges his extended commitment to the custody of the department pursuant to G. L. c. 120, \u00a7\u00a7 16-20 (1988 ed.).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We allowed the defendant\u2019s application for direct appellate review. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">The facts adduced at the jury trial are as follows. The Commonwealth presented the testimony of four witnesses duly qualified as experts. Dr. Carol N. Maurer, a supervising psychiatrist at a Pennsylvania treatment center where the department placed the defendant, diagnosed the defendant as being mentally ill by reason of a bipolar affective disorder in remission.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Dr. Maurer also stated in her diagnosis that the defendant suffered from a sexual identity disorder, pedo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>philia, and a narcissistic personality disorder. In her opinion, neither pedophilia nor a narcissistic personality disorder was a mental illness, but, she testified, the latter could intensify a bipolar affective disorder. Based on her diagnosis, Dr. Maurer stated her opinion that the defendant was dangerous by reason of mental illness and was \u201ccapable, when frustrated, of carrying out the same act [the murder of a child] again.\u201d* *<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"A7A\">The Commonwealth\u2019s second witness, Dr. Albert J. Scott, who holds a doctoral degree in education, evaluated the defendant on one occasion at the treatment center. He diagnosed the defendant as suffering from a bipolar affective disorder and a borderline personality disorder with antisocial tendencies. Dr. Scott classified both disorders as mental illnesses and considered the defendant dangerous to himself and others as a result of these disorders.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b366-6\">Dr. Craig Latham, a forensic psychologist with the Department of Mental Health, had examined the defendant on one occasion. He testified that the defendant was a danger to the public, that he \u201chad not received any treatment\u201d for his \u201csex offender\u201d behavior, and, according to staff reports, had been \u201ccommitting repeated acts of sexual aggression and manipulative behavior toward younger residents in the program.\u201d In Dr. Latham\u2019s opinion, the defendant exhibited \u201ca pattern of behavior that, if left unchecked or untreated, would continue,\u201d and that the \u201ccircumstances [for which the defendant was originally committed] could occur again.\u201d Dr. Latham opined, however, that there was no evidence of bipolar disorder and that pedophilia was not a mental illness. He <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>concluded that the defendant was not mentally ill and was not subject to commitment.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">The Commonwealth presented, as its final witness, Dr. George L. Hardman, a psychiatrist who had examined the defendant once three years before the trial. The doctor\u2019s diagnosis of the defendant included a bipolar affective disorder in remission and a narcissistic personality disorder, both of which Dr. Hardman classified as mental illnesses. Based on his review of the defendant\u2019s records prior to the trial and on the reports of Drs. Maurer, Scott, Latham, and Seghorn, Dr. Hardman stated his opinion that the defendant still suffered from these disorders and still presented a danger.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-6\">The defendant presented the testimony of one witness, Dr. Theoharis Seghorn, whose diagnosis and opinion were based on a personal evaluation of the defendant and interview with the staff at the treatment center conducted in conjunction with Dr. Latham, and on evaluation reports in the defendant\u2019s file, as well as on the results of a penile plethysmograph examination (discussed <em>infra). </em>This witness concluded that the defendant was not mentally ill and was not dangerous by reason of mental illness.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-7\">The defendant alleges the following errors occurred at the jury trial: (1) The judge abused his discretion in failing to declare a mistrial when members of the jury panel were left in a court hallway, prior to the taking of evidence, with members of a group calling themselves \u201cParents of Murdered Children\u201d; (2) the judge erred in admitting the testimony of Dr. Scott in violation of the psychotherapist-patient privilege; (3) the judge erred in admitting testimony of Dr. Maurer to the extent that her testimony relied on confidential conversations between the defendant and his therapist, Timothy Blackson, allegedly an agent of Dr. Maurer; (4) the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>judge erred in admitting the testimony of Dr. Hardman, as it was based on stale information; (5) the judge improperly instructed the jury regarding Dr. Seghorn\u2019s reliance on the results of a penile plethysmograph examination; (6) there was insufficient evidence to prove that the defendant was dangerous by reason of mental illness; and (7) the judge should have excluded testimony regarding personality disorders because such disorders are not mental illnesses under 104 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 3:01 (a) (1986). The defendant also contends that the two-tier de novo review of a department order extending commitment violated his right not to be put in jeopardy twice and his right to due process; that G. L. c. 120 does not authorize multiple extensions, and that multiple extensions violated his right to due process; that the commitment procedure under G. L. c. 120 denied the defendant his right to equal protection of the laws; and finally, that commitment without proof of a recent overt act demonstrating dangerousness deprived the defendant of his due process rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">1. <em>Motion for a mistrial. </em>The defendant claims that the judge should have declared a mistrial when it was discovered that members of the jury had been seated in a hallway among members of a group known as \u201cParents of Murdered Children,\u201d all of whom wore buttons bearing the name of the group. The defendant fails to cite any authority to support this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-6\">The judge conducted a voir dire examination of the jurors in accordance with the procedure prescribed in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>376 Mass. 790, 800-801 (1978), to determine whether any possible prejudicial information had reached any juror. Having found no prejudice, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Palmariello, </em>392 Mass. 126, 142 (1984) (judge has right to rely on juror statements), the judge took the added precaution of dismissing one juror who sat particularly close to the group. The judge also ordered all the buttons confiscated. The denial of the motion for a mistrial was not an abuse of the judge\u2019s discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"ae8-dedup-0\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>\n<em>Evidentiary Issues.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"acr-dedup-0\">a. <em>Psychotherapist-patient privilege. </em>The defendant argues that it was error to admit the testimony of one expert witness, Dr. Scott, a psychologist who evaluated the defendant, because Dr. Scott failed to give the defendant the appropriate warning prescribed in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lamb, </em>365 Mass. 265 (1974), prior to evaluating him. The judge ruled that the defendant\u2019s conversations with Dr. Scott did not fall within the statutory bounds of the psychotherapist-patient privilege, G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 20B (1988 ed.), because Dr. Scott has a doctoral degree in education, not a doctoral degree in the field of psychology.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> \u201cThe patient-psychotherapist privilege has never been recognized at common law. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gordon, </em>307 Mass. 155, 158 (1940). We are thus not inclined here to extend the patient-psychotherapist privilege beyond the bounds established by the Legislature. See <em>Usen </em>v. <em>Usen, </em>359 Mass. 453, 457 (1971).\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mandeville, </em>386 Mass. 393, 409 (1982). See <em>Adoption of Diane, </em>400 Mass. 196, 201 (1987). There was no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-9\">The defendant contends that the judge erred in allowing Dr. Maurer, a psychiatrist who qualifies as a psychotherapist under G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 20B,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and who allegedly supervised the defendant\u2019s therapist, to testify to her opinion of the defend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>ant\u2019s mental state which was based in part on communications between the defendant and his therapist.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The defendant argues that the therapist was an agent of Dr. Maurer, and, therefore, communications between the defendant and his therapist should be privileged to the extent communications between the defendant and Dr. Maurer would be privileged.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-6\">The therapist, Timothy Blackson, does not qualify independently as a psychotherapist under G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 20B, because he holds neither a medical degree in psychiatry nor a doctoral degree in the field of psychology. We have recognized the possibility of extending this statutory privilege to an agent of a psychotherapist where there exists a confidential relationship between the patient and the psychotherapist, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mandeville, supra </em>at 409; see also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Clemons, </em>12 Mass. App. Ct. 580, 586-587 (1981), and the therapist-psychotherapist relationship also meets the requirements of an agency relationship. Cf. <em>Kirk-Patrick </em>v. <em>Boston Mut. Life Ins. Co., </em>393 Mass. 640, 645 (1985) (agency relationship arises when one consents to act on behalf of another and subject to her control); Restatement (Second) of Agency \u00a7 1 (1958). There was no such agency relationship shown between Blackson and Dr. Maurer. Additionally, the evidence indicates that the defendant was told on numerous occasions, by his therapist and by his case worker from the department, that conversations with the therapist were not confidential. The defendant testified on voir dire that he had been so informed. We are therefore not inclined to extend the privilege to the conversations between the defendant and his therapist, Blackson.9 <footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b371-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>b. <em>Stale testimony. </em>The defendant contends that the judge should not have admitted the testimony of Dr. Hardman, who examined the defendant on one occasion over three years before the trial. Dr. Hardman based his opinion on that evaluation and a review of the defendant\u2019s records since that time. A judge has broad discretion in determining the admissibility of testimony concerning an evaluation which occurred at some time in the past. See <em>DeJesus </em>v. <em>Yogel, </em>404 Mass. 44, 47 (1989). The period of time between an evaluation, here Dr. Hardman\u2019s clinical examination of the defendant in 1986, and the testimony of a witness is a factor which the trier of fact may weigh in assessing the credibility of the testimony. The judge did not abuse his discretion by admitting testimony based on an evaluation conducted three years earlier, as well as a review of the defendant\u2019s records since that time. Additionally, the judge could have considered trial testimony by Dr. Latham that \u201cnothing about [the defendant\u2019s] particular pattern of thinking has changed.\u201d There was no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">c. <em>The judge\u2019s limiting instructions regarding basis of expert\u2019s opinion. </em>The defendant claims that the judge improperly instructed the jury that Dr. Seghorn\u2019s opinion of the defendant\u2019s mental state was based \u201c[t]o a great degree\u201d on the results of a penile plethysmograph examination,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> which, the judge told the jury, was not commonly used, but which has a \u201cfair degree of reliability.\u201d On the basis of this language, the defendant asserts that the judge essentially told the jury they could discount Dr. Seghorn\u2019s testimony. The defendant exaggerates the effect of these words.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>\u201cA trial judge may properly bring to the jury\u2019s attention issues of fact and conflicts of testimony. He may point out factors to be considered in weighing particular testimony. Nothing . . . precludes, or could properly, preclude, such guidance where the judge clearly places the function of ultimate appraisal of the testimony upon the jury.\u201d <em>Barrette </em>v. <em>Hight, </em>353 Mass. 268, 271 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b372-5\">Review of the trial transcript reveals that, while the results of the plethysmograph test may not have had great significance in Dr. Seghorn\u2019s over-all evaluation of the defendant, the results were a basis of his opinion as to the defendant\u2019s sexual orientation. The transcript reveals that the judge clearly and extensively instructed the jury that they, not the judge, were the ultimate fact finders who determined what weight and effect to give testimony. There was no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-6\">d. <em>Sufficiency of the evidence. </em>The defendant claims there was insufficient evidence for a jury to find beyond a reasonable doubt that he was dangerous by reason of mental illness. We review the record in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth to determine whether a jury reasonably could find beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant was dangerous by reason of mental illness. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Barboza, </em>387 Mass. 105, 110, cert, denied, 459 U.S. 1020 (1982). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Burbank, </em>388 Mass. 789, 797 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b372-7\">The standard for extending an individual\u2019s commitment to the control of the department is whether that individual \u201cwould be physically dangerous to the public because of the person\u2019s mental or physical deficiency, disorder or abnormality.\u201d G. L. c. 120, \u00a7 17. In <em>Department of Youth Servs. </em>v. <em>A Juvenile, </em>398 Mass. 516, 523 (1986), we held that, because G. L. c. 120 and c. 123 \u201care concerned with the same general subject matter,\u201d c. 123\u2019s definitions of similar words would apply to c. 120. A \u201cmental or physical deficiency, disorder or abnormality\u201d in c. 120 is defined by the term \u201cmental illness\u201d in c. 123. <em>Id. </em>at 524.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Chapter 120\u2019s term <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>\u201cphysically dangerous to the public\u201d is defined by \u201clikelihood of serious harm\u201d in c. 123. <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>13</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">There was evidence before the jury that the defendant had sexually assaulted and murdered a five year old boy, that nothing about the defendant\u2019s pattern of thinking had changed, and that the defendant was \u201ccapable, when frustrated,\u201d of committing the same act of violence again. There was also evidence that the defendant had attempted suicide and had demonstrated sexual aggression and manipulative behavior. Each of the Commonwealth\u2019s witnesses testified that the defendant was a danger to himself and others. Three of those four witnesses testified that the defendant was dangerous by reason of mental illness. There was expert testimony indicating that the defendant suffered from bipolar affective disorder in remission, which is a mood disorder impairing his judgment, a narcissistic personality disorder, which is also a mood disorder, and pedophilia. The expert witnesses disagreed about whether a narcissistic personality disorder is a mental illness. That is a question of fact for the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">\u201cJudicial experience with psychiatric testimony makes it abundantly clear that it would be unrealistic to treat an opinion .. . by an expert on either side of . . . [an] issue as conclusive. . . . The law should not, and does not, give the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>opinions of experts on either side of . . . [an] issue the benefit of conclusiveness, even if there are no contrary opinions introduced at the trial.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>DeMinico, </em>408 Mass. 230, 235 (1990), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lamb, </em>372 Mass. 17, 24 (1977). There was sufficient evidence for a jury reasonably to find beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant was dangerous by reason of mental illness.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">3. <em>Constitutional Issues.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b374-6\">a. <em>Constitutionality of the two-tier review system for extending a Department of Youth Services commitment order. </em>According to the defendant, the two-tier procedure for extending commitment of individuals to the department placed the defendant in double jeopardy. The defendant acknowledges that the two-tier system currently in place in the District Court Department of the Trial Co\u00fart of this Commonwealth has been found constitutional even where there was insufficient evidence presented at the bench trial to warrant a conviction. See <em>Justices of the Boston Municipal Court </em>v. <em>Lydon, </em>466 U.S. 294 (1984); <em>Lydon </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>381 Mass. 356, cert, denied, 449 U.S. 1065 (1980). The defendant argues that the present appeal is distinguishable, because in <em>Lydon </em>the defendant had the option of a jury trial in the first instance or a bench trial with a right to seek a jury trial on a determination of guilt at the bench trial, whereas in this case the defendant was given no option to choose a jury trial in the first instance.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-7\">The issue of a defendant\u2019s option was not determinative for the United States Supreme Court in <em>Justices of the Boston Municipal Court </em>v. <em>Lydon, supra, </em>nor was it determinative in this court\u2019s holding in <em>Gibson </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>381 Mass. 372 (1980), cert, denied, 449 U.S. 1089 (1981), and <em>A Juvenile </em>v. <em>Commonwealth (No. 2), </em>381 Mass. 379, cert, denied, 449 U.S. 1062 (1980). Contrast <em>Gibson </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, supra </em>at 378 (Liacos, J., dissenting, with whom Abrams, J., joined). The Court held that, the process does not expose a defendant to double jeopardy. There is no merit to the defendant\u2019s double jeopardy claim under the decided case law.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>b. <em>Multiple extensions of commitment under G. L. c. 120, \u00a719, and due process. </em>The defendant contends that the statute permitting the extended commitment of an individual to the department is impermissibly vague on the issue of multiple extensions. General Laws c. 120, \u00a7 19, set out in the margin,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> applies when the department has already secured the confirmation of one extension order. When a person committed as a juvenile has that commitment extended, the department must, according to G. L. c. 120, \u00a7 19, make a new order and new application for review if the department deems the individual \u201cphysically dangerous to the public because of the person\u2019s mental or physical deficiency, disorder or abnormality,\u201d the requirement for extending commitment under \u00a7 17. \u201cSuch orders and applications may be repeated at intervals as often as in the opinion of the department may be necessary for the protection of the public, except that the department shall have power, in order to protect other children and adolescents, to transfer the custody of any person eighteen years of age or older to the department of correction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>for placement in the appropriate institution.\u201d G. L. c. 120, \u00a7 19.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The statute clearly permits at least two extensions.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">The defendant next argues that he was denied due process of law because the department is not capable of providing the defendant with the proper treatment for his mental illness. The cases the defendant cites do not support his proposition that a mentally ill person has a constitutional right to be committed to one State agency rather than another. Instead, the cases hold that a person committed for treatment of mental illness has a due process right to receive treatment, see <em>O\u2019Connor </em>v. <em>Donaldson, </em>422 U.S. 563 (1975); <em>Rouse </em>v. <em>Cameron, </em>373 F.2d 451 (D.C. Cir. 1966); <em>Wyatt </em>v. <em>Stickney, </em>325 F. Supp. 781 (M.D. Ala. 1971), and the right to receive the least restrictive or least burdensome control necessary to pursue rehabilitation. See <em>Thompson, petitioner, </em>394 Mass. 502, 505-507 (1985); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Nassar, </em>380 Mass. 908, 917-918 (1980). There was <em>no </em>evidence that the defendant received inadequate treatment or that commitment to the department was unnecessarily restrictive. See <em>Youngberg </em>v. <em>Romeo, </em>457 U.S. 307 (1982); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>407 Mass. 47, 49-51 (1990); <em>Newton, petitioner, </em>357 Mass. 346, 352-353 (1970); <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Gaughan, </em>808 F.2d 871, 877 (1st Cir. 1986). Cf, G. L. c. 120, \u00a7 6 (1988 ed.). The defendant was not denied his right to due process of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-6\">c. <em>Equal protection. </em>The defendant\u2019s third constitutional challenge is that the procedural differences between commitments under c. 120, \u00a7\u00a7 16-20, and commitments under c. 123, which have as the same purpose the treatment of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>mentally ill persons, see <em>Department of Youth Servs. </em>v. <em>A Juvenile, </em>398 Mass. 516, 523 (1986), denied the defendant equal protection of the laws. Specifically, the defendant indicates that the c. 123 commitment process is initiated by the superintendent of a Department of Mental Health facility, whereas the c. 120 commitment process is initiated by a \u201cbureaucratic order.\u201d Compare G. L. c. 123, \u00a7 7 <em>(a) </em>(1988 ed.), with G. L. c. 120, \u00a7 17. The defendant contends that a superintendent of a Department of Mental Health facility is more qualified to determine the committability of \"an individual for mental health reasons than is the Department of Youth Services. The defendant also challenges the venue of the committing court, claiming that a \u201cc. 123 court\u201d is more appropriate than a \u201cc. 120 court.\u201d Compare G. L. c. 123, \u00a7 7 <em>(a) </em>(District Court in jurisdiction of superintendent), with G. L. c. 120, \u00a7 17 (original committing court). These differences are insignificant and do not rise to the level of an equal protection concern.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">Last, the defendant notes that commitment under c. 123 is initially for a period of six months, or in some circumstances, one year, with later extensions for no greater than one year. G. L. c. 123, \u00a7 8 <em>(d) </em>(1988 ed.). The defendant, however, asserts incorrectly that an individual may be committed under c. 120 for two years without review. General Laws c. 120, \u00a7 5 <em>(b) </em>(1988 ed.), requires \u201cperiodic reexamination of all persons within [the department\u2019s] control.\u201d The reexaminations \u201cmay be made as frequently as the department considers desirable, and shall be made with respect to every person at intervals not exceeding one year.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Failure to reexamine an individual within one year entitles that individual to petition the committing court for an order of discharge. G. L. c. 120, \u00a7 5 <em>(d) </em>(1988 ed.). As stated in <em>Department of Youth Servs. </em>v. <em>A Juvenile, supra </em>at 523, c. 120 and c. 123 \u201care concerned with the same general subject matter\u201d and \u201chave as their purpose the protection of others from physical harm and the treatment of the mentally ill person.\u201d Given that the statutes have the same purpose, yet one chapter initially commits an individual for a shorter time period, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>G. L. c. 123, \u00a7 8 <em>(d), </em>there must be a rational basis for distinguishing between those civilly committed as dangerous by reason of mental illness under c. 123, and those committed as dangerous by reason of mental illness after commitment to the Department of Youth Services. See <em>Baxstrom </em>v. <em>Herold, </em>383 U.S. 107, 111 (1966); <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Gaughan, supra </em>at 880-881. A short interval for review of a recently committed person\u2019s condition while in the control of the Department of Mental Health assures familiarity with that individual and the state of his condition. An individual whose commitment is extended by action of the Department of Youth Services under c. 120, has been in the control of the department for some time. The department\u2019s familiarity with that individual\u2019s condition is assured. There is a rational basis for this differentiation. The defendant was not denied equal protection of the laws.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">d. <em>Evidence of dangerousness and due process. </em>The defendant argues that the judge deprived him of due process by failing to instruct the jury that dangerousness by reason of mental illness must be predicated on evidence of a recent overt act. To support his contention, the defendant cites <em>Lynch </em>v. <em>Baxley, </em>386 F. Supp. 378, 391 (M.D. Ala. 1974); <em>Lessard </em>v. <em>Schmidt, </em>349 F. Supp. 1078, 1093 (E.D. Wis. 1972), vacated on other grounds, 414 U.S. 473 (1974); and <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Nassar, </em>380 Mass. 908, 916-918 (1980). The holdings in <em>Lessard </em>and <em>Lynch </em>are no longer persuasive, however, in light of <em>United States </em>v. <em>Sahhar, </em>917 F.2d 1197 (9th Cir. 1990), cert, denied, 111 S. Ct. 1591 (1991) (considering involuntary civil commitment standard). The <em>Sah-har </em>court held that \u201ca finding of \u2018substantial risk\u2019 [of causing bodily injury] . . . may be based on <em>any </em>activity that evinces a genuine possibility of future harm to persons .... Whether that activity occurred recently is but one factor for the [finder of fact] to consider in weighing the evidence.\u201d (Em<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>phasis in original. Citation omitted.) <em>Id. </em>at 1207. \u201cNor do we believe that due process requires a finding that defendant recently committed dangerous acts. In establishing the clear and convincing evidence standard for civil commitments, [the Supreme Court, in <em>Addington </em>v. <em>Texas, </em>441 U.S. 418, 427 (1979),] held that commitment must be based on \u2018something more serious than is demonstrated by idiosyncratic behavior.\u2019 . . . Otherwise, <em>Addington </em>placed no due process limits on the range of evidence a [trier of fact] may consider in reaching its decision.\u201d (Citation omitted.) <em>Id. </em>at 1207-1208. Further, contrary to the defendant\u2019s assertion, our decision in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Nassar, supra, </em>did not recognize a requirement of a recent overt act as a basis for finding a \u201clikelihood of serious harm.\u201d Rather, referring to <em>Lessard </em>v. <em>Schmidt, supra, </em>we said that a showing of imminent <em>future </em>harm was linked to the enhanced standard of proof beyond a reasonable doubt, and that to \u201cthe degree that the anticipated physical harm is serious \u2014 approaches death \u2014 some lessening of a requirement of \u2018imminence\u2019 seems justified.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 917. There is no requirement that a \u201clikelihood of serious harm\u201d be established by evidence of a <em>recent </em>overt act. Nor does the statutory definition of \u201clikelihood of serious harm,\u201d G. L. c. 123, \u00a7 1, require a recent overt act. The judge made no error in excluding such a requirement from his instructions to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b365-6\">The defendant sexually assaulted a five year old boy and drowned him when the boy threatened to disclose the incident.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b365-7\">General Laws c. 120, \u00a7\u00a7 16-19, as appearing in St. 1990, c. 267, \u00a7\u00a7 6-9, effective December 5, 1990, do not apply to this case as the defendant\u2019s extended commitment occurred before the effective date of the amendment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b365-8\">A bipolar affective disorder, Dr. Maurer explained, is characterized by dramatic mood swings from a manic or highly excited state, to a depressed state.
