Limone, was convicted in July, 1968, of being an accessory before the fact to murder, and of participating in two separate conspiracies to murder. We affirmed the convictions of Limone and his co-defendants in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>French, </em>357 Mass. 356 (1970), judgments vacated as to death penalty sub nom. <em>Limone </em>v. <em>Massachusetts, </em>408 U.S. 936 (1972). Several other appellate and postconviction remedy attempts litigated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>between 1970 and 1976 also failed to overturn the defendant\u2019s convictions.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The defendant filed a second motion for a new trial on January 2, 1990. After hearing, a judge of the Superior Court denied the motion. A single justice of this court allowed the defendant\u2019s application for leave to appeal to the full court only in so far as the motion for a new trial challenged the trial judge\u2019s charge to the jury on reasonable doubt. <em>Leaster </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>385 Mass. 547, 549 (1982). We affirm the order denying the defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">The facts of this case are set forth in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>French, supra, </em>and <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cassesso, </em>360 Mass. 570 (1971), judgments vacated as to death penalty sub nom. <em>Limone </em>v. <em>Massachusetts, </em>408 U.S. 936 (1972). In his appeal, the defendant claims that the trial judge\u2019s charge on reasonable doubt was improper because it included specific examples of personal decisions in the lives of the jurors. The defendant relies on a line of cases beginning with <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ferreira, </em>373 Mass. 116, 128-130 (1977), in which we held that, where the judge drew an analogy between proof beyond a reasonable doubt and the making of important decisions in the jurors\u2019 personal lives, the use of specific examples of personal decisions trivialized the jurors\u2019 duty and the Commonwealth\u2019s burden of proof. Although the defendant did not raise this issue at trial, he is not precluded from doing so at this time, because the constitutional theory on which he relies was not sufficiently developed at the time of his trial and appeal.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Tameleo, </em>384 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>Mass. 368, 369 n.2 (1981); <em>DeJoinville </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>381 Mass. 246, 248 (1980). Furthermore, the theory has been applied retroactively. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Garcia, </em>379 Mass. 422, 438-442 (1980), citing <em>In re Winship, </em>397 U.S. 358 (1970), made retroactive by <em>Ivan V. </em>v. <em>New York, </em>407 U.S. 203 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"A8T\">The relevant portion of the charge appears in the margin.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Tameleo, </em>384 Mass. 368 (1981), we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>scrutinized this very charge in the course of reviewing the appeal from a denial of a motion for new trial of one of Limone\u2019s codefendants. There, we held that the charge, read in its entirety, did not so trivialize the concept of proof beyond a reasonable doubt as to require reversal of the convictions. <em>Id. </em>at 371. We noted that \u201c[t]he charge emphasized the \u2018great responsibility\u2019 of the jurors to ascertain the truth from the evidence presented, and generally impressed on the jurors the caution and care they must exercise before returning any verdict against any defendant.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">We recognize that there is a certain amount of tension between <em>Tameleo </em>and our later decision in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rembiszewski, </em>391 Mass. 123 (1984). In <em>Rembiszewski, </em>we reversed a conviction of murder in the first degree after finding that the charge on reasonable doubt, which used specific examples of personal decisions in the jurors\u2019 lives, was not distinguishable in any significant way from the erroneous charges in <em>Ferreira </em>and <em>Garcia, </em>and was constitutionally inadequate. <em>Id. </em>We reiterated, however, that \u201cwe have never held nor do we now hold, that the use of specific examples necessarily imports error, constitutional or otherwise.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 128-129, quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>381 Mass. 141, 145 (1980). Instead, we repeated our consistent position that \u201cto determine whether a definition of reasonable doubt accurately conveys the meaning of the term, it is necessary to consider the charge as a whole.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 130, quoting <em>Smith, supra. </em>The charge here is more like those upheld in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Grace, </em>381 Mass. 753 (1980); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Smith, supra', </em>and <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hughes, </em>380 Mass. 596 (1980), than those found to be defective in <em>Ferreira </em>and <em>Garcia.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b383-6\">In <em>Ferreira, supra </em>at 128-129, the judge charged the jury that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b384-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>\u201c[y]ou must be as sure as you would have been any . time in your own lives that you had to make important decisions affecting your own economic or social lives. You know, . . . you couldn\u2019t be absolutely, mathematically sure that you were doing the right thing \u2014 you weigh the pros and cons; and unless you were reasonably sure beyond a reasonable doubt . . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">He then gave specific examples of these decisions. <em>Id. </em>Similarly, the erroneous charges in <em>Garcia, supra </em>at 439 n.9, and <em>Rembiszewski, supra </em>at 128 n.l, also compared the degree of certainty the jury members should have when rendering a verdict to the degree they would want when deciding to make specific changes in their personal lives, after weighing the pros and cons of making such a change.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In criticizing this type of charge, we stated that \u201c[w]e do not think that people customarily make private decisions according to this [beyond a reasonable doubt] standard nor may it even be possible to do so. Indeed, we suspect that were this standard mandatory in private affairs the result would be massive inertia.\u201d <em>Fer-reira, supra </em>at 130. See <em>Rembiszewski, supra </em>at 131 (\u201cHuman experience teaches that most, if not all, of the decisions to which the judge referred as illustrating the meaning of proof beyond a reasonable doubt [what work to go into, whether to marry, buy a house, change jobs, have surgery] are made on the basis' of perceptions as to probabilities\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b385-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>The charge in this case, unlike the charges criticized above, did not compare the jurors\u2019 duty in rendering a verdict to weighing the wisdom of taking a future course of action in their personal lives. Rather, the jurors\u2019 duty was compared to making a decision as to the truth of a factual proposition, based on the credibility of the person relating it. The judge said, \u201cNow, you received some information from a certain person. If he has related the truth, you should make the change. But if he is not telling the truth, you will make a terrible mistake. Now, shall you believe him or not . . . You were not present when . . . this incident took place about which he talked.\u201d The specific examples of personal decisions merely introduced this illustration, and were used to explain the seriousness of the factual decision rather than to illustrate the required degree of certainty.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hughes, </em>380 Mass. 596, 601 (1980) (charge not erroneous because the judge \u201cused the heart surgery illustration more to explain the seriousness of the decision than to illustrate the required degree of certainty\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">Furthermore, in other portions of the charge the judge instructed that \u201ceach of you should vote as your conscience dictates, and your conscience alone,\u201d that \u201c[a] false verdict against a defendant is as deep an injury to the community as a false verdict in favor of the defendant. A verdict must be a true verdict,\u201d and that a unanimous verdict is required \u201c[t]o assure deliberation. To assure a dissection, a consideration of every bit of evidence . . . and in that way we get as near to the truth as possible.\u201d These statements contributed to im<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>press on the jurors the seriousness of their duty. Accordingly, we reaffirm our conclusion in <em>Tameleo, supra </em>at 371, that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-5\">\u201c[t]he charge emphasized the \u2018great responsibility\u2019 of the jurors to ascertain the truth from the evidence presented, and generally impressed on the jurors the caution and care they must exercise before returning any verdict against any defendant. We conclude that, read in its entirety, \u2018the charge did not so trivialize the concept of proof beyond a reasonable doubt as to require reversal of the conviction.\u2019 <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>381 Mass. 141, 146 (1980).\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b386-6\">Finally, the judge\u2019s comment that beyond a reasonable doubt means \u201cbeyond a doubt with a reason behind that doubt\u201d would not have shifted the burden of proof by requiring the jury to search for a \u201creason\u201d to acquit, as the defendant argues. Just prior to this comment, the judge had instructed the jury as to the presumption of innocence and had stated that \u201cthe burden is on the Commonwealth to convince you beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant is guilty. The burden of proof is not on the defendant to prove that he is innocent, and the burden of proof is to convince you beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d In light of this instruction and of the charge as a whole, we do not believe that the challenged language could have shifted the burden of proof in the minds of the jurors. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bjorkman, </em>364 Mass. 297, 308 (1973). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>382 Mass. 189, 198 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b386-7\">For the foregoing reasons, the order denying the defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-8\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b381-6\">The defendant\u2019s first motion for a new trial was denied by a Superior Court judge in 1970, and that denial was affirmed by this court in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cassesso, </em>360 Mass. 570 (1971). The United States District Court dismissed a Federal habeas corpus petition filed by Limone in 1974, and that dismissal was affirmed in <em>Grieco </em>v. <em>Meachum, </em>533 F.2d 713 (1st Cir.), cert, denied sub nom. <em>Cassesso </em>v. <em>Meachum, </em>429 U.S. 858 (1976).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b381-7\">There was no foreshadowing of the rule expressed in <em>Ferreira </em>until our decision in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bumpus, </em>362 Mass. 672, 682 (1972), judgment vacated and remanded on other grounds, 411 U.S. 945 (1973), a ff'd on rehearing, 365 Mass. 66 (1974), reviewed on petition for habeas corpus sub nom. <em>Bumpus </em>v. <em>Gunter, </em>452 F.

It means beyond a doubt with a reason behind that doubt. It does not mean beyond a doubt in the mind of someone who is looking for a doubt, and it does not mean to a . mathematical certainty. Perhaps I have said this to you already, but I think I can best explain what is meant by convincing a jury beyond a reasonable doubt by correcting [defense counsel] who tried to discuss this same matter in his argument yesterday.</p>\n<p id=\"AmGE\">\u201cSuppose you have an important question of your own, a real serious problem, one that means a great deal to your future \u2014 whether you should buy a business or not; shall you sell your house and buy another; shall you move your family to another state or not.

You just have to make up your own mind, and you meditate and you think of him, think of all you know about him, his past, his education, his intelligence, his reputation, anything you know about him you think about.- And after serious thought and meditation you say to yourself, \u2018Well, I don\u2019t have enough confidence in him.
