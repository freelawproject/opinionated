M. Lynch applied to the commissioner for a medallion. The application was denied because the commissioner had already distributed the maximum of 1,525 medallions, and Lynch appealed to the department. BNTA, CBCA, and the city of Boston were allowed to intervene in the proceedings before the department. On March 14, 1990, after lengthy hearings, the department determined that \u201c300 to 500 additional medallions would be an absolute minimum number to meet the public convenience and necessity standard.\u201d The department decided to \u201cphase in increases in the medallion limit in a three-step process\u201d so that it could analyze \u201cthe degree to which public convenience and necessity has been met by [each] incremental increase in medallions.\u201d Accordingly, the department ordered that the maximum number of medallions be raised to 1,825 \u201ceffective immediately,\u201d to 1,925 within the following eighteen months, and to 2,025 a year after that. The order requires the city of Boston to file a \u201cprogress report\u201d one year after the first 300 additional medallions are issued, whereupon the department will \u201cevaluate] whether the public convenience and necessity require the completion of the second two increases of the phase-in.\u201d Both BNTA and CBCA appealed the department\u2019s order to the single justice of this court who consolidated the cases and reserved and reported the matter to the full court. He allowed the motions of Lynch and the city of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>Boston to intervene, and granted a stay of the department\u2019s order pending appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-5\">BNTA and CBCA urge that we reverse the department\u2019s order on the ground that the department lacked the authority to raise the medallion limit above 1,525. In addition, CBCA argues that the department exceeded its jurisdiction by increasing the limit beyond the one medallion Lynch requested. We reject these arguments. We conclude, however, that the department lacked the authority to order the increase in three stages.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-6\">1. BNTA and CBCA contend that St. 1934, c. 280, bars the department from raising the medallion limit above 1,525. The 1934 statute (see note 4, supra) provides, in part, that the commissioner shall fix the maximum number of medallions to be issued at a number not to exceed 1,525. In the next paragraph the statute states that, if an applicant is denied a license because the <em>\u201cmaximum number of licenses limited </em>hereunder\u201d has been issued, the department may \u201cdetermine that public convenience and necessity require a higher limit and shall establish the limit so required . . .\u201d (emphasis added). St. 1934, c. 280. BNTA and CBCA suggest that the italicized phrase extends the 1,525-medallion cap to the department as well as the commissioner. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-7\">BNTA\u2019s and CBCA\u2019s interpretation contradicts the plain language of the statute. The statute provides only that the department\u2019s discretion is limited by the \u201cpublic convenience and necessity\u201d standard. It states: \u201c[The department] may . . . determine that public convenience and necessity require a higher limit than that fixed by [the] commissioner . . . and shall establish the limit so required . . . .\u201d St. 1934, c. 280. To import the 1,525-medallion limit from the preceding paragraph would violate the rule of construction that \u201cwhere the Legislature has employed specific language in one paragraph, but not in another, the language should not be implied where it is not present.\u201d <em>Massachusetts Medical Soc\u2019y </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Ins., </em>402 Mass. 44, 63 (1988), quoting <em>Beeler </em>v. <em>Downey, </em>387 Mass. 609, 616 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b706-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>Furthermore, the text of the disputed phrase does not suggest that the 1,525-medallion limit applies to the department\u2019s decision. Giving the words of the statute their ordinary meaning, <em>Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Ins., </em>397 Mass. 416, 420 (1986), we read the phrase merely as a condition of the department\u2019s jurisdiction to entertain an appeal: <em>if </em>the commissioner refuses to issue a medallion \u201cby reason of the fact that the maximum number of licenses limited hereunder [that is, under St. 1934, c. 280] has been issued,\u201d <em>then </em>the department may consider an appeal of that decision. St. 1934, c. 280. Logically, this prerequisite is unrelated to the criteria the department is to use in deciding such an appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-5\">Accordingly, we conclude that the language of the statute clearly establishes that, in deciding an appeal such as Lynch\u2019s, the department is to determine the appropriate number of medallions to be issued according to the \u201cpublic convenience and necessity\u201d standard, unconstrained by the 1,525-medallion cap. We will not, as B\u00d1TA and CBCA urge, consider the legislative history or agency interpretations of the statute where its meaning is unambiguous. See <em>Massachusetts Community College Council MTA/NEA </em>v. <em>Labor Relations Comm\u2019n, </em>402 Mass. 352, 354 (1988); <em>McCarthy </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue, </em>391 Mass. 630, 633 (1984); <em>Hoffman </em>v. <em>Howmedica, Inc., </em>373 Mass. 32, 37 (1977). \u201cIt is elementary that the meaning of a statute must, in the first instance, be sought in the language in which the act is framed, and if that is plain, ... the sole function of the courts is to enforce it according to its terms.\u201d <em>Massachusetts Community College Council MTA/NEA, supra, </em>quoting <em>Caminetti </em>v. <em>United States, </em>242 U.S. 470, 485 (1917).</p>\n<p id=\"b706-6\">2. CBCA next contends that, even if the department had the authority to raise the medallion limit above 1,525, it lacked the authority to establish a limit higher than 1,526 because Lynch had only applied for one medallion. The short answer to this argument is that the statute does not limit the department\u2019s discretion to fix the number of issuable medallions to the number of applicants before it. The statute pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>vides that the department \u201cmay, after a hearing, determine that public convenience and necessity require a higher limit than that fixed by [the] commissioner or previously established by [the] department and shall establish the limit so required . . . .\u201d St. 1934, c. 280. Thus, the Legislature plainly directed that the public interest alone is to guide the department\u2019s determination. See <em>Zachs </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Utils., </em>406 Mass. 217, 223-224 (1989) (discussing \u201cpublic convenience and necessity\u201d standard). Again, we reject as contrary to the statute\u2019s plain meaning the contention that the statute places a numerical limit on the maximum the department may set.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-5\">3. We agree with CBCA\u2019s final argument, however, that the form of the department\u2019s order exceeds the department\u2019s jurisdiction. The department ordered that the medallion limit be increased from 1,525 to 1,825 effective immediately. In addition, the department ruled that, \u201cunless otherwise ordered by the Department,\u201d the limit would rise to 1,925 eighteen months from the date of the order, and to 2,025 one year thereafter. The department stated: \u201cThe Department may, at its discretion, solicit comments and/or reopen hearings\u201d after the first 300 additional medallions are issued in order to determine \u201cwhether the public convenience and necessity require the completion of the second two increases of the phase-in.\u201d This three-step process does not conform to the requirements of St. 1934, c. 280, for two reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-6\">First, under the plain language of the statute, an applicant\u2019s appeal is a prerequisite to the department\u2019s considering the medallion limit. The statute provides that the department acquires jurisdiction to consider the medallion limit only upon the \u201cpetition of [an] applicant\u201d who \u201cis refused a license ... by reason of the fact that the maximum number of licenses limited hereunder has been issued.\u201d St. 1934, c. 280. See note 4, <em>supra. </em>The department circumvents this statutory requirement by finding that public convenience and necessity require an additional \u201c300 to 500\u201d medallions, and allowing for a later determination of whether that number will be 300, 400, or 500. This procedure violates the statute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>because it permits the department itself to initiate the subsequent consideration of the medallion limit. Under St. 1934, c. 280, the department\u2019s involvement can only be triggered by a frustrated applicant\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-5\">Second, the statute does not permit an incremental \u201cphase-in\u201d of new medallions. The statute directs the department to \u201cestablish the limit . . . required\u201d by \u201cpublic convenience and necessity.\u201d We construe this to mean the number of medallions currently warranted by the public requirements, for it is unrealistic to think that the department can predict what the public need will be at some point in the future. In this case, however, the department\u2019s \u201cphase-in\u201d requires the release of 100 medallions one and one-half years in the future, and of 100 more medallions a year later. The statute does not ask the agency to prophesy the public\u2019s need for taxi service at these points.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-6\">We accord due weight and deference to an agency\u2019s reasonable interpretation of a statute within its charge. <em>Massachusetts Medical Soc\u2019y </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Insurance, </em>402 Mass. 44, 62 (1988). In addition, we acknowledge that an agency is deemed to have not only those powers expressly conferred by statute, but also those reasonably necessary to carry out its mission. See <em>Morey </em>v. <em>Martha\u2019s Vineyard Comm\u2019n, </em>409 Mass. 813, 818 (1991); <em>Town Taxi, Inc. </em>v. <em>Police Comm\u2019r of Boston, </em>377 Mass. 576, 586 (1979). We conclude, however, that the department\u2019s construction of St. 1934, c. 280, to permit an incremental release of medallions runs afoul of the statute\u2019s plain meaning, and therefore we reverse the agency\u2019s construction in this respect. The department\u2019s order and accompanying written opinion do not fix the medallion limit at a precise number.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Therefore we remand this case to the department to fix an appropriate, definite number of medallions in light of the current public con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>venience and necessity, to take effect immediately upon the department\u2019s order.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b709-5\">4. Finally, CBCA argues that the department erred in denying motions brought by BNTA for reconsideration and for clarification of the order. It is doubtful whether CBCA has standing to bring such a claim.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Standing to appeal a final order of the department is limited to an \u201caggrieved party in interest.\u201d G. L. c. 25, \u00a7 5 (1990 ed.). See <em>American Hoechest Corp. </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Utils., </em>379 Mass. 408, 410-411 (1980); <em>Boston Gas Co. </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Utils., </em>368 Mass. 780, 805 (1975). Because it does not affect the outcome of this case, however, we pass over the question whether, for purposes of the statute, CBCA may be considered \u201caggrieved\u201d by the denial of motions it did not bring.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-6\">CBCA contends on appeal that the recent downturn in economic conditions justifies the department\u2019s reexamining whether the public interest will be served by additional taxicabs taking to the streets of Boston. However, neither BNTA nor CBCA raised this argument before the agency in support of the motions. Generally, a party is not entitled to raise an argument on appeal that was not raised before the administrative agency. <em>Seagram Distillers Co. </em>v. <em>Alcoholic Beverages Control Comm\u2019n, </em>401 Mass. 713, 724 (1988). <em>Langlitz </em>v. <em>Board of Registration of Chiropractors, </em>396 Mass. 374, 382 (1985). Therefore, we decline to consider this claim for the first time here.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-7\"><em>Conclusion. </em>The department\u2019s findings and order are affirmed in all respects except the requirement that additional medallions be released in increments over two and one-half <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>years. Accordingly, we remand the case to the department for further action consistent with section 3 of this opinion.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b710-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b703-14\">Statute 1963, c. 386, limits the right of persons who do not have a Boston medallion to solicit passengers within the city. <em>Town Taxi, Inc. </em>v. <em>Police Comm\u2019r of Boston, </em>377 Mass. 576, 578 (1979).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b703-15\">In relevant part, St. 1934, c. 280, reads as follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-16\">\u201c[The Boston police] commissioner shall, as soon as may be, fix a limit for the number of licenses to be issued under this section, which limit shall be based upon the number of licenses then issued and outstanding but shall not be in excess of fifteen hundred and twenty-five, and he may from time <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>to time, after reasonable notice and a hearing, decrease the limit so fixed, but in no event to a number less than nine hundred.</p>\n<p id=\"AfEH\">\u201cIf an applicant is refused a license hereunder by reason of the fact that the maximum number of licenses limited hereunder has been issued, the department of public utilities, on petition of such applicant, may, after a hearing, determine that public convenience and necessity require a higher limit than that fixed by said commissioner or previously established by said department and shall establish the limit so required, in which case the limit set by said department shall be considered final until again changed as herein provided.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b708-7\">The department found, in part: \u201cCredible testimony of the City\u2019s witnesses leads us to conclude that the recommended range of 300 to 500 additional medallions would be an absolute minimum number to meet the public convenience and necessity standard. . . . [T]he addition of 300 to 500 taxicab medallions is more than justified by the record in this case.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b709-8\">As this opinion merely calls for a clarification of the department\u2019s previous order, we do not imply that the department must hold new hearings or expand the record before it.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-9\">We do not reach CBCA\u2019s argument that the department\u2019s decision to authorize the issuance of additional medallions in three stages is unsupported by the record.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b709-10\">BNTA itself does not argue that the department erred in denying its motions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b710-6\">Robert K. M. Lynch argues that he is entitled to one of the newly authorized medallions. This issue is not properly before the court because Lynch never sought from the department a ruling that he was entitled to a medallion, nor has the commissioner in fact refused to issue him a medallion. For present purposes, therefore, Lynch\u2019s pursuit of a medallion is significant only as the catalyst for the department\u2019s consideration of the medallion limit. The statute does not specifically authorize the department to grant licenses to applicants turned down because the statutory cap on licenses has been reached, although that power may exist by implication. On remand Lynch ought to be allowed to amend his petition in order to raise the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-7\">In addition, amici representing physically disabled persons ask this court to uphold parts of the department\u2019s order finding, in brief, that \u201cit would be appropriate that some portion of the [new] medallions be expressly set aside for wheelchair-accessible vehicles.\u201d No party contests the department\u2019s findings and order pertaining to taxi service for the physically disabled, and therefore, this aspect of the department\u2019s findings and order also present no justiciable issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
