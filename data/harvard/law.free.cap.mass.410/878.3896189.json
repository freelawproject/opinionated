The warrant was issued by an assistant clerk-magistrate of the Taunton Division of the District Court Department. A few hours later, the warrant was executed by Dr. Philip M. Falkoff, a physician at Morton Hospital (hospital) in Taunton. The plaintiff brought this action in Superior Court alleging that Furtado, the city, Dr. Falkoff, and the hospital interfered with her constitutional right under art. 14 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights to be free from unreasonable searches in violation of the State Civil Rights Act, G. L. c. 12, \u00a7\u00a7 11H, 111 (1990 ed.) (SCRA).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"880\">*880</page-number>The defendants filed motions for summary judgment pursuant to Mass. R. Civ. P. 56, 365 Mass. 824 (1974). A judge of the Superior Court granted the motions. The plaintiff appealed from the ensuing judgments. We transferred the case from the Appeals Court on our own motion. We conclude that the doctrine of qualified immunity protects Furtado and Dr. Falkoff from liability. We also conclude that there are no facts in the record to support the plaintiffs contention that the city and the hospital interfered with her constitutional rights \u201cby threats, intimidation or coercion.\u201d G. L. c. 12, \u00a7 11H. We affirm. We note, however, that if the plaintiffs allegations are true, we would view the conduct of the police in this case as outrageous.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-5\">The facts of record, viewed in a light favorable to the plaintiff, are as follows.* *<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> On August 21, 1986, at approximately 1 a.m., Furtado and other police officers arrived at the plaintiffs apartment. The police officers had a warrant to search the apartment (this warrant is not in issue on this appeal) and a warrant to search the plaintiffs vagina for narcotics \u201cto be conducted by a licensed physician at M\u00f3rton Hospital.\u201d The officers knocked on the door and proceeded to force the door open. The plaintiff was in bed with her husband. Furtado entered the bedroom and told the plaintiff that he had a warrant to search her vagina. Furtado demanded that the plaintiff reach into her vagina and take out the \u201cstuff,\u201d but she refused. The plaintiff and other members of her household (husband, daughter, grandson, and nephew) were then \u201cherded\u201d into the living room while the police <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"881\">*881</page-number>searched the apartment for two hours. The police failed to find any narcotics in the apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-5\">At approximately 3:30 a.m., the plaintiff was taken to the hospital by Officer Jane McManus of the Taunton police department. After they arrived at the hospital, the plaintiff was left by McManus in an examining room. McManus then showed the warrant to Dr. Falkoff, the emergency room physician on duty. A few minutes later, Dr. Falkoff and a nurse entered the examining room. The plaintiff informed Dr. Falkoff that she was not consenting to being touched in any way. Dr. Falkoff left the room and telephoned Thomas Porter, the hospital\u2019s acting president and \u201con-call\u201d administrator. Porter advised Dr. Falkoff of the hospital\u2019s consent policy and its policy that court orders be obeyed. Dr. Falkoff returned to the examining room and told the plaintiff that he was going to search her vagina. The plaintiff once again refused to consent to being touched by Dr. Falkoff. The nurse then grabbed the plaintiff by the shoulders and pushed her down onto the examining room table and placed her legs in stirrups.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Dr. Falkoff put on rubber gloves and proceeded to insert a probe into the plaintiff\u2019s vagina. He then removed the probe, placed one hand on the plaintiffs stomach, and inserted his \u201cfingers or some other instrument\u201d far into her vagina. No drugs were found inside the plaintiffs vagina.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-6\">1. <em>Qualified immunity. </em>We consider first whether Furtado and Dr. Falkoff are immunized from liability as matter of law. We conclude that they are immunized. Thus, it is not necessary to discuss the plaintiffs claim against Furtado and Dr. Falkoff, arising from the alleged violation of the SCRA, except to the extent that the claim affects the determination whether Furtado and Dr. Falkoff are entitled to immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-7\">a. <em>Joseph Furtado. </em>The Legislature, in enacting the SCRA, intended to adopt the standard of immunity for public officials developed under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 (1988). <em>Duarte </em>v. <em>Healy, </em>405 Mass. 43, 46 (1989). The United States Supreme Court has held that most public officials who exercise <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"882\">*882</page-number>discretionary functions are entitled to qualified immunity from liability for damages under \u00a7 1983. <em>Harlow </em>v. <em>Fitzgerald, </em>457 U.S. 800, 818 (1982).* ***<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The Court in <em>Harlow </em>concluded that \u201cgovernment officials performing discretionary functions, generally are shielded from liability for civil damages insofar as their conduct does not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Court explained that qualified immunity is a necessary compromise between the need to provide remedies to individuals whose constitutional rights have been violated and the necessity of protecting public officials from \u201c[insubstantial lawsuits\u201d which may deter them from carrying out their official responsibilities. <em>Id. </em>at 814.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b898-4\">The plaintiff makes two arguments in support of her claim that her constitutional right to be free from unreasonable searches was violated. First, citing <em>Rochin </em>v. <em>California, </em>342 U.S. 165 (1952), and <em>Schmerber </em>v. <em>California, </em>384 U.S. 757 (1966), the plaintiff contends that a search of an individual\u2019s body cavities is always unconstitutional because of the intrusive nature of the search. In <em>Rochin, </em>the police, without a warrant, entered the defendant\u2019s home. The defendant, upon seeing the police, placed two small capsules into his mouth. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"883\">*883</page-number>The police struggled with the defendant in an attempt to extract the capsules. When this failed, the defendant was handcuffed and taken to a hospital where, at the direction of the officers, a physician forced an emetic solution through a tube into the defendant\u2019s stomach against his will. The defendant vomited, and the police found two capsules of morphine. <em>Id. </em>at 166. The Court reversed the conviction for possession of narcotics, concluding that the conduct of the police \u201cshocks the conscience\u201d and violated the defendant\u2019s right to due process. <em>Id. </em>at 172-174.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b899-4\">In <em>Schmerber </em>v. <em>California, supra, </em>the police, also without a warrant, took a blood sample from the defendant who was arrested for driving an automobile while under the influence of alcohol. <em>Id. </em>at 758-759. The Court held that the search was reasonable even though there was no warrant because of the exigent circumstances (a delay would have reduced the level of alcohol in the blood), the intrusion was minor, and the test was performed in a reasonable manner. <em>Id. </em>at 770-771. The Court cautioned in dictum, however, that more substantial intrusions, or intrusions under other conditions, may be prohibited by the United States Constitution. <em>Id. </em>at 772.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-5\"><em>Rochin </em>and <em>Schmerber </em>do not support the plaintiff\u2019s argument that it was clearly established at the time her vagina was searched that such a search violated the Constitution. The fact that Furtado sought and was issued a warrant, while not dispositive, see <em>Malley </em>v. <em>Briggs, </em>475 U.S. 335, 345-346 (1986), differentiates this case from <em>Rochin. </em>In addition, Furtado, unlike the police officers in <em>Rochin, </em>did not engage in a struggle with the plaintiff in an attempt forcibly to extract items from her vagina. <em>Schmerber, </em>on the other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"884\">*884</page-number>hand, dealt with the exigent circumstances exception to the warrant rule, and, while the Court in that case was concerned with the intrusive nature of searches \u201cinvolving intrusions beyond the body\u2019s surface,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 769, it did not state, in its holding or in dictum, that such searches are per se unconstitutional. We cannot say that a reasonable police officer in Furtado\u2019s position would have known that the search of the plaintiffs vagina violated constitutional rights which were clearly established at the time of the search. See <em>Duarte </em>v. <em>Healy, supra </em>at 48-49. Compare <em>Hopper </em>v. <em>Callahan, </em>408 Mass. 621, 625 (1990) (constitutional rights of involuntarily committed individuals clearly established at time of defendants\u2019 acts).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b900-5\">The second argument raised by the plaintiff involves the affidavit which Furtado presented to the magistrate in support of the issuance of the warrant. The affidavit relied on information provided by a confidential informant. \u201cWhen law enforcement officials use an informant\u2019s tip as the basis <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"885\">*885</page-number>for a[ ] ... search, art. 14 . . . requires that the Commonwealth satisfy the two-pronged test set out in <em>Aguilar </em>v. Texas, 378 U.S. 108 (1964), and <em>Spinelli </em>v. <em>United States, </em>393 U.S. 410 (1969). The Commonwealth \u2018must demonstrate some of the underlying circumstances from which (a) the informant gleaned his information (the \u201cbasis of knowledge\u201d test), and (b) the law enforcement officials could have concluded the informant was credible or reliable (the \u201cveracity\u201d test).\u2019 <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cast, </em>407 Mass. 891, 896 (1990).\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Frazier, ante </em>235, 239 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b901-5\">While the plaintiff is correct when she argues that the <em>Aguilar-Spinelli </em>requirements were clearly established at the time Furtado applied for the warrant, that is not sufficient to preclude Furtado from using a qualified immunity defense. See <em>Anderson </em>v. <em>Creighton, </em>483 U.S. 635, 639-640 (1987). Instead, the dispositive question \u201cis whether a reasonably well-trained [police] officer in [Furtado\u2019s] position would have known that his affidavit failed to establish probable cause and that he should not have applied for the warrant. If such was the case, [Furtado\u2019s] application for a warrant was not objectively reasonable, because it created the unnecessary danger of an unlawful [search].\u201d <em>Malley </em>v. <em>Briggs, supra </em>at 345.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-6\">The confidential informant\u2019s belief that the plaintiff kept narcotics in her vagina was based on the fact that he or she once went to the plaintiff\u2019s apartment, and after the informant requested a \u201cfix,\u201d the plaintiff \u201c[took] the money and enter [ed] the bath room only to return with the works all ready to shoot up.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The confidential informant also heard <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"886\">*886</page-number>other individuals talking about the fact that the plaintiff kept drugs in her vagina.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-5\">Even if we were to assume, without deciding, that the affidavit failed the \u201cbasis of knowledge\u201d test of <em>AguilarSpinelli, </em>we cannot conclude that the affidavit was \u201cso lacking in indicia of probable cause as to render official belief in its existence unreasonable.\u201d <em>Malley </em>v. <em>Briggs, supra </em>at 345.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The fact that an affidavit fails the \u201cbasis of knowledge\u201d test is not sufficient to overcome a qualified immunity defense. If this were not the case, a police officer would be liable every time he or she files an affidavit which lacks probable cause. The imposition of liability on a police officer because an affidavit lacks probable cause would \u201cdampen the ardor of all but the most resolute, or the most irresponsible [police officers].\u201d <em>Harlow </em>v. <em>Fitzgerald, </em>457 U.S. 800, 814 (1982), quoting <em>Gregoire </em>v. <em>Biddle, 117 </em>F.2d 579, 581 (2d Cir. 1949), cert, denied, 339 U.S. 949 (1950). \u201c[I]t is inevitable that law enforcement officials will in some cases reasonably but mistakenly conclude that probable cause is present, and . . . in such cases those officials \u2014 like other officials who act in ways they reasonably believe to be lawful \u2014 should <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"887\">*887</page-number>not be held personally liable.\u201d <em>Anderson </em>v. <em>Creighton, supra </em>at 641.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-4\">b. <em>Dr. Philip M. Falkoff. </em>The judge granted summary judgment in favor of Dr. Falkoff based on <em>LaLonde </em>v. <em>Eissner, </em>405 Mass. 207 (1989). In <em>LaLonde, </em>we held that a psychiatrist who was designated by the probation department pursuant to a court order to perform a psychiatric evaluation of a child was entitled to absolute immunity because of the quasi judicial nature of the psychiatrist\u2019s assignment. <em>Id. </em>at 213. We need not decide whether Dr. Falkoff should receive absolute immunity, since he is entitled to qualified immunity which is sufficient to protect him from liability. See <em>Mulgrew </em>v. <em>Taunton, ante </em>631, 634-635 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b903-5\">While private parties such as Dr. Falkoff usually are not entitled to the defense of qualified immunity, see <em>Downs </em>v. <em>Sawtelle, </em>574 F.2d 1, 15 (1st Cir.), cert, denied, 439 U.S. 910 (1978) (under \u00a7 1983, qualified immunity does not protect private actors who allegedly conspired with State actors to violate plaintiff\u2019s constitutional rights), Dr. Falkoff in this case performed a duty customarily carried out by a public employee, namely the execution of a warrant.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Policy and fairness considerations militate in favor of extending immunity to physicians who, pursuant to a warrant, conduct searches of body cavities. If a law enforcement official would be entitled to immunity for executing a particular warrant, it would be anomalous to deny a private physician immunity for executing the same warrant. Since it was not \u201cobjectively unreasonable\u201d for Furtado to have sought a warrant in this case, we cannot conclude that it was objectively unreasonable for Dr. Falkoff to have executed the warrant. See <em>Malley </em>v. <em>Briggs, </em>supra; <em>Harlow </em>v. <em>Fitzgerald, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b903-6\">Even though we conclude that Furtado and Dr. Falkoff are entitled to qualified immunity which shields them from liability, we are nonetheless deeply troubled by the search <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"888\">*888</page-number>which was conducted in this case. The fact that the plaintiff was taken to the hospital by the police in the middle of the night to have her vagina searched raises, at the very least, the possibility that the police were more interested in intimidating the plaintiff than they were in finding narcotics. It is difficult to imagine a more intrusive, humiliating, and demeaning search than the one conducted inside the plaintiff\u2019s body. In cases such as the present one, where the police seek to conduct a search inside the body of an individual, it may be appropriate to require a higher level of certainty than \u201cmere\u201d probable cause. If less than probable cause is required in cases where the level of intrusion is relatively low, see <em>Terry </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>392 U.S. 1, 26 (1968), it may be appropriate to require a higher level of certainty in cases involving extremely intrusive searches. Additionally, we think it sound policy to require that, in the future, such a warrant be issued only by a person legally trained, i.e., a judge. Thus, at the very least, in the future, under the exercise of our general superintendence powers, we shall deem a warrant authorizing the search of a body cavity to be invalid unless issued by the authority of a judge, on a strong showing of particularized need supported by a high degree of probable cause.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> We must, however, leave the development of this rule for another day when we shall be able to analyze fully the constitutional implications of these types of highly intrusive searches without being constrained by the doctrine of qualified immunity.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b905-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"889\">*889</page-number>2. <em>The city and the hospital. </em>The plaintiff argues that the city should be liable under the SCRA because it has a policy whereby experienced police officers such as Furtado may seek warrants without the authorization of supervisors. The plaintiff, however, fails to explain how the city, by having such a policy, interfered with her constitutional right to be free from unreasonable searches \u201cby threats, intimidation or coercion.\u201d G. L. c. 12, \u00a7 11H. There is no evidence in the record that the city, directly or indirectly through Furtado, threatened, intimidated, or coerced the plaintiff. See <em>Bally </em>v. <em>Northeastern Univ., </em>403 Mass. 713, 719 (1989); <em>Deas </em>v. <em>Dempsey, </em>403 Mass. 468, 470-471 (1988).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Similarly, there is no evidence in the record that the hospital, through its agent Thomas Porter (who advised Dr. Falkoff of the hospital\u2019s policies on consent and court orders), interfered with the plaintiff\u2019s constitutional right to be free from unreasonable searches through threats, intimidation, or coercion. See <em>Bally </em>v. <em>Northeastern Univ., supra; Deas </em>v. <em>Dempsey, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b905-5\">\n<em>Judgments affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b895-13\">Prior to bringing this action in Superior Court, the plaintiff filed suit in United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts alleging vio<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"880\">*880</page-number>lations of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 (1988) and the SCRA. A summary judgment was granted in favor of the defendants on the \u00a7 1983 claim. The SCRA claim was dismissed without prejudice.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b896-8\">While we state the facts in this fashion, see <em>Martin </em>v. <em>School Comm. of Natick, </em>395 Mass. 461, 462 (1985), we note that various affidavits of the defendants dispute the plaintiffs allegations of use of force and crude behavior by the police officer and by medical personnel. In the view we take, the disputed facts as to the method of the search become immaterial. See Mass. R. Civ. P. 56 (c) (summary judgment may issue if no \u201cgenuine issue as to any <em>material </em>fact\u201d [emphasis supplied]).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b897-8\">But see note 3, <em>supra. </em>These facts are disputed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b898-5\">The Court also has stated that some public officials such as judges, legislators, prosecutors, and the President of the United States are entitled to absolute immunity. See <em>Harlow </em>v. <em>Fitzgerald, </em>457 U.S. 800, 807 (1982), and cases cited.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b898-9\">In <em>Wood </em>v. <em>Strickland, </em>420 U.S. 308, 322 (1975), the Court had held that the standard for qualified immunity should have both an objective and a subjective component. Thus, a public official will \u201cnot [be] immune from liability for damages under \u00a7 1983 if he knew or reasonably should have known that the action he took within his sphere of official responsibility would violate the constitutional rights of the [plaintiff], or if he took the action with the malicious intention to cause a deprivation of constitutional rights or other injury to the [plaintiff].\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Court in <em>Harlow, </em>however, eliminated the subjective component of the qualified immunity standard, reasoning that it was incompatible with the policy rationale of precluding insubstantial lawsuits from proceeding to trial since \u201cquestions of subjective intent . . . rarely can be decided by summary judgment.\u201d <em>Harlow </em>v. <em>Fitzgerald, supra </em>at 816.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b899-6\">The plaintiff, in her complaint, does not argue that her substantive due process rights were violated. Instead, her claim is that the search of her vagina was unreasonable. <em>\u201cRochin </em>was decided on \u2018substantive\u2019 due process grounds before <em>Mapp </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>367 U.S. 643 . . . (1961), had extended the reach of fourth amendment protections to state action. But its standard for gauging the fundamental fairness of bodily intrusions under due process guarantees applies as well to gauging the reasonableness of body searches under fourth amendment guarantees.\u201d <em>Lee </em>v. <em>Winston, </em>717 F.2d 888, 899 n.13 (4th Cir. 1983), aff'd, 470 U.S. 753 (1985).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b900-6\">There is much law on the constitutionality of body cavity searches in prisons. See, e.g., <em>Bell </em>v. <em>Wolfish, </em>441 U.S. 520 (1979); <em>Langton </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>404 Mass. 165 (1989); <em>Blackburn </em>v. <em>Snow, 771 </em>F.2d 556 (1st Cir. 1985); <em>Arruda </em>v. <em>Fair, </em>710 F.2d 886 (1st Cir. 1983), cert, denied, 464 U.S. 999 (1984). We do not think that those cases are germane to the present case because of the \u201cdiminished\u201d Fourth Amendment rights of prisoners, see <em>Bell </em>v. <em>Wolfish, supra </em>at 557, 558-560, and their visitors, see <em>Blackburn </em>v. <em>Snow, supra </em>at 563.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-7\">In <em>Winston </em>v. <em>Lee, </em>470 U.S. 753 (1985), the Court upheld the decisions of the lower Federal courts that intrusive surgery to recover a bullet in the body of the defendant would not be a \u201creasonable\u201d search under the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution. The Court stated: \u201cNotwithstanding the existence of probable cause, a search for evidence of a crime may be unjustifiable if it endangers the life or health of the suspect.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 761. In contrast, in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Montoya de Hernandez, </em>473 U.S. 531, 541 (1985), a border search case, the Court upheld the detention of a traveler for several hours on a showing of \u201creasonable suspicion.\u201d During the period in which the traveler was detained, a warrant was issued which authorized a rectal examination of the traveler. <em>Id. </em>at 535. No Massachusetts decision under art. 14 on body cavity searches has been cited, nor have we discovered any. We do not decide today the issues whether body cavity searches are precluded totally under art. 14. For the purpose of this case, it suffices that the law was not \u201cclearly established\u201d when Furtado obtained the warrant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b901-7\">Furtado\u2019s affidavit contained fifteen paragraphs.

Black Flag is also called black hero or black tar. This informant said that it is kept under the kitchen sink and that there is a strong possibility that Shirley Mello Rodriquez might be holding some in a rubber in her vagina. The informant said that there is also cocaine in the apartment. That this officer asked the informant what made it [believe] that it would be kept in her vagina and it went on to say that on one occasion it went to [Shirley\u2019s] and in asking for a fix Shirley would take the money and enter the bath room only to return with the works all ready to shoot up, and that he has heard other people talking about it, especially from Paul Guzman who is real close to Shirley.

We are of the view, however, that, in cases involving the search of a body cavity, there must be a high degree of probable cause to believe that contraband is inside the cavity <em>independently </em>whether there is probable cause to believe that the individual searched is hiding contraband elsewhere in his or her home or on his or her person.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b904-6\">Even if we were to conclude today that more than probable cause is required before an individual\u2019s body cavity can be searched, it would not benefit the plaintiff, since such a rule was not clearly established at the time the search in this case was conducted.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b905-6\">The United States Supreme Court has held that a municipality will be liable under \u00a7 1983 only \u201cwhen execution of a government\u2019s policy or custom, whether made by its lawmakers or by those whose edicts or acts may fairly be said to represent official policy, inflicts the injury\u201d to the plaintiff. <em>Monell </em>v. <em>Department of Social Servs. of the City of N.Y., </em>436 U.S. 658, 694 (1978). The plaintiff argues that the city\u2019s policy satisfies <em>Monell. </em>We need not decide, however, whether the Legislature intended to adopt the <em>Monell </em>standard when it enacted the SCRA since there is no evidence that the city interfered with the plaintiff\u2019s alleged constitutional rights through threats, intimidation, or coercion.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
