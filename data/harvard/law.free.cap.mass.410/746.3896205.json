Represented by new counsel on appeal, the defendant argues that the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument gave rise to a substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice. We reject this contention. We also conclude that there is no reason to exercise our power under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"747\">*747</page-number>(1990 ed.), to reduce the conviction of murder in the first degree to second degree or to order a new trial.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b763-5\">The underlying facts of the crimes are essentially undisputed, and we recount them in brief. The defendant had lived with his girl friend, Carmen Milagro Pineiro, for approximately six years prior to the fall of 1983. Some weeks before the murders, the defendant\u2019s brother, Doel Cosme Figueroa, moved into the apartment with the defendant, Carmen, and their children. Difficulties developed between the defendant and Carmen and Doel, the defendant apparently becoming jealous over Doel\u2019s relationship with Carmen. About six weeks before the murders, Carmen ejected the defendant from the apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-6\">Sometime thereafter (about a week prior to the murders), the defendant purchased a revolver and ammunition. On October 2, 1983, the defendant spent most of the day at the apartment of Carmen\u2019s mother, discussing his situation. Carmen\u2019s mother tried to persuade the defendant to return to Puerto Rico. As he left, however, the defendant said, \u201cI know what I\u2019m going to do.\u201d Later that day, the defendant arrived at Carmen\u2019s apartment. Both Carmen and Doel were there. Carmen refused the defendant entry, and angry words were exchanged between the defendant and Carmen and Doel. The defendant then went outside to Doel\u2019s truck in the parking lot. He disabled the truck by removing the ignition cables, then went to get his car. Seeing this, Carmen, Doel, and the children went outside.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-7\">While the group was gathered around the truck, the defendant returned in his car. Three times the defendant drove around and parked near the group and got out of the car. The first two times, the defendant glared angrily at Doel and Carmen, and Doel told the defendant in substance that the defendant would have to kill both him (Doel) and Carmen. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"748\">*748</page-number>After each of these two confrontations, the defendant temporarily left the area. When the defendant returned the third time, the same confrontation occurred. Rather than leaving this time, the defendant returned to his car, removed his revolver, then approached Doel and shot him four times, including once in the head. The defendant then chased the fleeing Carmen and shot her twice, including once in the head. Both Doel and Carmen died of their wounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-5\">The defendant\u2019s revolver was of single action design, so the defendant had to pull the revolver\u2019s hammer back manually each time that he fired it. Three and one-half pounds of pressure was required to pull the trigger. Thus, for each of the six shots fired, the defendant pulled the hammer back fully and exerted the necessary pressure on the trigger.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-6\">After the shootings, the defendant fled in his car, discarding the gun, a bag of bullets, and a holster nearby. The defendant spent the hours after the shootings but prior to his arrest with a friend who assisted the defendant in moving his car out of the area and transferring it to another owner. The defendant told his friend that he had shot his brother three times and his girl friend twice, and that he was sure that his brother was dead, but he was not sure about his girl friend. During this time, the defendant appeared \u201cpeaceful\u201d and \u201cnormal,\u201d and there was nothing unusual about his behavior.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-7\">In addition to the testimony that established the facts just summarized, there was expert testimony concerning the issue of the defendant\u2019s criminal responsibility. In support of his argument that he lacked the ability to conform his conduct to the requirements of the law, the defendant called two expert witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-8\">The defendant\u2019s first expert witness was Dr. Vernon Mark. Dr. Mark, a neurosurgeon, testified to the defendant\u2019s history and the results of tests that he had administered to the defendant in 1987 and 1989. Dr. Mark indicated that the defendant sustained a head injury as a child, had little formal education, and suffered from chronic, severe headaches. Testing revealed that the defendant had substandard mental function. There also was some evidence of abnormal electri<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"749\">*749</page-number>cal activity in the brain. From this information, Dr. Mark concluded that the defendant had abnormal brain functions in his frontal lobe, the seat of, among other functions, an understanding of the consequences of one\u2019s actions. Dr. Mark expressed no opinion on criminal responsibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-5\">Dr. Jonathan Lieff, a neuropsychiatrist, also obtained the defendant\u2019s history and performed a battery of tests in 1989. Based on his examinations, Dr. Lieff testified that the defendant had a very \u201crigid and constricted\u201d personality (consistent with his head injury), and lacked the ability to control his conduct when angered and to avoid acting impulsively. Thus, at the time of the shootings, although the defendant appreciated the wrongfulness of his conduct, he was, in Dr. LiefFs view, unable to control his aggression and conform his conduct to the requirements of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-6\">The Commonwealth presented the expert testimony of Dr. Martin Kelly, a psychiatrist. Based on his review of the defendant\u2019s records, including legal records and those examined by the defense experts, and an interview of the defendant, Dr. Kelly concluded that, at the time of the shooting, the defendant did not have a serious mental disease or defect that would impair his capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness of his conduct or to conform his conduct to the requirements of the law. Dr. Kelly explained that neurological damage does not necessarily indicate the existence of a mental disease or defect; the crucial question is whether the person\u2019s behavior, thoughts, moods, or interaction with others is affected. Dr. Kelly concluded, based on the defendant\u2019s conduct before and after the shootings, that the defendant was able to make choices and was able to conform his behavior and conduct to those choices. In Dr. Kelly\u2019s view, the choices may have been unwise, and the defendant might now regret them, but they made sense at the time within his understanding of the situation between his girl friend and his brother.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b766-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"750\">*750</page-number>1. <em>The prosecutor\u2019s closing argument. </em>During his closing argument, the prosecutor attacked the testimony of the defendant\u2019s expert witnesses. The defendant argues that many of the prosecutor\u2019s statements were so improper that a new trial is required.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-5\">The prosecutor\u2019s statements that have been singled out for criticism by the defendant are set forth in the Appendix to this opinion in the context in which they were made. We have added numbers in brackets before each passage in which a criticized remark appears for purposes of more easily identifying matters in the discussion to follow. The statements were not objected to by the defendant\u2019s trial counsel. Our inquiry is limited to whether the prosecutor\u2019s argument created a substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sullivan, ante </em>521 (1991). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Colon, </em>408 Mass. 419, 444 (1990). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Roberts, </em>407 Mass. 731, 736 (1990). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Glass, </em>401 Mass. 799, 805-807 (1988). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kozec, </em>399 Mass. 514, 518 n.8 (1987). In deciding that question, we apply the following standard, recently stated in an opinion considering an allegation of prosecutorial misconduct in a first-degree murder case. \u201cIn examining remarks made during closing arguments for overreaching, this court considers the remarks in the context of the entire argument, and in light of the judge\u2019s instruction to the jury, and the evidence at trial. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Yesilciman, </em>406 Mass. 736, 746 (1990). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lamrini, </em>392 Mass. 427, 432 (1984). \u2018The prosecutor is entitled to argue the evidence and fair inferences to be drawn therefrom.\u2019 <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Paradise, </em>405 Mass. 141, 152 (1989). <em>Lamrini, supra </em>at 431. Counsel may attempt to assist the jurors in analyzing the evidence by suggesting what conclusions they should draw from the evidence. <em>Lamrini, supra </em>at 431. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ferreira, </em>381 Mass. 306, 316 (1980).\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Colon-Cruz, </em>408 Mass. 533, 553 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"751\">*751</page-number>(1990). We conclude, for the following reasons, that the defendant has not demonstrated the existence of a substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-5\">First, the prosecutor was entitled to make fair reply to the argument of the defendant\u2019s trial counsel about the weight to be given to the testimony of the defendant\u2019s experts. In that argument, defense counsel essentially told the jury not to try to understand the fine points of the testimony of the defense doctors \u201cbecause a lot of what they said was in medical terms that none of us understand,\u201d and he urged them to accept the doctors\u2019 conclusions solely because of their impressive credentials.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The prosecutor was thus faced with the task of countering the aura of scientific invincibility that de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"752\">*752</page-number>fense counsel had tried to create. He attempted to do this by arguing that, although they possessed impressive credentials, the defendant\u2019s experts were both fallible and mistaken. In support of that theme, the prosecutor advised the jury that the case was a simple one, and that the defendant\u2019s true state of mind should best be determined by his deliberate conduct and statements before, during, and after the shootings.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-5\">Second, the goals stated above w.ere legitimate, and, based on the evidence, the prosecutor was entitled to argue to the jury, see Appendix [1], [3], [4], that tests done on the defendant should be discounted in favor of the evidence of the defendant\u2019s thoughts and conscious actions at the time of the killings. Indeed, the Commonwealth\u2019s expert had testified that the proper approach to the issue of criminal responsibility in this case was just that: the existence of a mental defect did not depend on test results, but turned on the defendant\u2019s behavior, thoughts, mood, and interaction with others. The prosecutor\u2019s comments could perhaps be characterized in some respects as overly rhetorical, but on the whole they were fair and supported by the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence.* **<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"753\">*753</page-number>See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Moore, 408 Mass. 117, 133-134 (1990). It was also reasonable comment for the prosecutor to suggest, see Appendix [2], [3], [4], [7], that the defense experts possessed limited information, derived from tests conducted years after the incident, which did not square with the substantial evidence that the defendant had acted with deliberate premeditation. This argument was based on the evidence described above and also took into account evidence that because brain function is \u201cdynamic,\u201d the results of the tests done on the defendant might not disclose his functioning at the time of the crimes when he could well have behaved normally. Over-all, the prosecutor\u2019s argument sought to show that the defendant\u2019s expert testimony was subject to criticism because it was narrowly grounded, based on the existence of a questionable neurological impairment, lacking in any proof of any psychosis, and quick to concede that, at the time of the shootings, the defendant was fully aware of his conduct and its lawlessness.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-5\">Third, the judge gave several instructions that are relevant to the issue of substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice. The judge told the jury that \u201cnothing the attorneys say ... in their closing arguments\u201d is evidence, because the arguments are \u201cexactly that, arguments from the evidence . . . .\u201d This instruction, of course, is common, but the judge repeated its substance three times: before trial, before the start of final arguments, and during final instructions. The judge also gave clear and comprehensive instructions on what constituted the evidence, how credibility should be assessed, and the role of expert witnesses. These instructions emphasized the role of counsel\u2019s arguments as compared to the absolute function of the jury in deciding credibility and determining ultimate facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-6\">Importantly, the judge gave clear and comprehensive instructions on the law of criminal responsibility and on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"754\">*754</page-number>principles stated in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gould, </em>380 Mass. 672 (1980), and the Commonwealth\u2019s burden of proof with regard thereto. We think these instructions established a detailed framework for the jury to consider, in a reasonable and objective manner, whether the Commonwealth had met its burden of proof on the elements of the crimes charged and on the issues of criminal responsibility and on the principles stated in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gould, supra</em>.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-5\">Fourth, we agree with the defendant that the references to the testimony of the defendant\u2019s two doctors as a \u201cdog and pony show,\u201d and to one of the doctors as a \u201clittle head specialist,\u201d and a \u201cwizard,\u201d see Appendix [4], were tasteless and improper. These references, however, were so manifestly sarcastic and hyperbolic that the jury likely accepted them as such and discounted them accordingly. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Good, </em>409 Mass. 612, 626 (1991). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bradshaw, </em>385 Mass. 244, 277 (1982). In light of what has been said thus far, we do not consider them to have been as potentially destructive as the condemnation leveled at the defense psychiatrists in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Shelley, </em>374 Mass. 466, 470 (1978), where it was flagrantly suggested that the defendant had purchased the testimony of his expert witness.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b770-6\">In summary: taken as a whole, and in the context of the actual trial and the jury instructions, we think the jury would have considered the prosecutor\u2019s argument as urging them to pay attention to the defendant\u2019s conduct before, during, and after the crimes and to reject the theory of the defendant\u2019s experts about the defendant\u2019s criminal responsibility as narrowly grounded and improbable.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-7\">The defendant also argues that the prosecutor misstated and mischaracterized the evidence in several respects. His <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"755\">*755</page-number>principal complaints here concern the prosecutor\u2019s statement that Dr. Mark did not know the defendant played a guitar,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> see Appendix [3], and the statements that the doctors had indicated that the defendant could not use his fingers and hands, see Appendix [5], and would have the jury believe that the defendant was someone who could barely walk and talk.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> See Appendix [6],</p>\n<p id=\"b771-5\">The thrust of these parts of the prosecutor\u2019s argument was to reemphasize that the jury should consider the opinions of the doctors in light of the considerable evidence that the defendant possessed the physical ability to commit the crimes charged. Although imperfectly executed, the argument was an appropriate one to make. We cannot say that these statements created a substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Thomas, </em>400 Mass. 676, 683 (1987); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Haas, </em>398 Mass. 806, 813 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b771-6\">2. <em>Review under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E. </em>The essential facts surrounding the shooting of Doel are as follows. The defendant purchased the murder weapon days before the shooting. On the day of the murders he armed himself and went to Carmen\u2019s apartment (after having told Carmen\u2019s mother, \u201cI know what I\u2019m going to do\u201d). After the initial confrontation with Carmen and Doel, the defendant restricted Doel\u2019s opportunity to flee by disabling Doel\u2019s truck. The defendant then confronted Doel three more times before shooting him. To discharge the revolver, the defendant manually cocked the hammer and pulled the trigger for each of four shots. One of the four shots was to Doel\u2019s head, and there was evidence suggesting that it was delivered while Doel was lying helpless on the ground. On this evidence, the jury were more than justified in finding the defendant guilty of deliberately premeditated murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"756\">*756</page-number>In the circumstances of this case, neither the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument, nor the evidence that the defendant may have suffered from certain dysfunctions or personality disorders, nor the facts that the defendant knew the victims well and had no prior criminal record, persuade us that a miscarriage of justice has occurred. We decline to exercise our power to reduce the verdict of murder in the first degree or to order a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-5\">\n<em>Judgments affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b772-6\">Appendix.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-7\">[1] \u201cThere\u2019s no issue that Mr. Cosme shot two people. You don\u2019t have to go in there and say, gee, Paula Reddick, is she sure, was Carmen sure, was Angel Santiago? <footnotemark>[1]</footnotemark> There\u2019s no question about that, is there? The Commonwealth suggests, that while that\u2019s an element of the crime, it\u2019s not an issue you need to discuss. You don\u2019t have to discuss where it happened, what weapon was used, how many bullets were in each person\u2019s brain, how he got away in the get away car, how he tried to sell it in Rhode Island. A lot of the evidence is there, undisputed.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-8\">\u201cThe Commonwealth suggests to you, the only thing, the only thing you should even consider and discuss for any length of time, any critical analysis, the only thing to look at is what Vernon Mark tried to do with his color photographs, but you do it through witnesses, look inside this man\u2019s head, not with x-rays and CAT scans and EEC\u2019s, no. Look inside. Did he know what he was doing? Do you think he knew what he wanted to do and what he did that day?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b772-9\">[2] \u201cDefense counsel wants you to focus on a lot of things, the Commonwealth suggests to you, are [un] important. He\u2019d like you to look at death certificates and look at them, they\u2019re still dead. He wants you to listen to Larry Bolduc, <footnotemark>[2]</footnotemark> who testified this morning, but he said, oh, yeah, I did forget my glasses, when I looked out the window. He wants you to focus on tests that are 1987, 1988, look at who these professionals are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"757\">*757</page-number>and their background, so you won\u2019t know what they said, just look at who they are.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-4\">\u201cLook. Look. Look. But don\u2019t look down like Carmen Pineiro did to the parking lot. Don\u2019t look down at her mother with her life going from her and the baby brother in her arms. Don\u2019t look at them.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-5\">\u201cDid defense counsel want to talk about that? Did he talk about how Julio had to load the gun and pull the trigger back each time he fired? No. He doesn\u2019t want to look at that, because that tells you what Julio was thinking that day, doesn\u2019t it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b773-6\">\u201cDr. Mark and Dr. Lieff, they can tell you that, yes, six years later, I had him do this little test with his hands, fine. That\u2019s beautiful.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-7\">\u201cLadies and gentlemen, the evidence in this case, the Commonwealth suggests to you, is overwhelming, that Julio Cosme knew what he was doing that day. You don\u2019t need experts. You don\u2019t need psychiatrists. If we wanted psychiatrists as jurors, that\u2019s all we\u2019d have. You don\u2019t need them. You don\u2019t need them to understand. Isn\u2019t the case simple enough?</p>\n<p id=\"b773-8\">[3] \u201cHusband gets thrown out by wife. Husband doesn\u2019t like that. Husband gets gun. Husband loads gun. Tells mother-in-law, I know what I\u2019m going to do. He goes back to get the wife. She says, no. He says, okay. You\u2019re not coming? See you later. Doel goes, kill me first. Okay, Doel. Four shots. Hey, Carmen, don\u2019t run. In the back. Hey, Carmen, you\u2019re still alive. In the forehead. And I\u2019m getting out of here.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-9\">\u201cNot very complicated. No one has to go through x-ray and CAT scans to figure out why someone would kill.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-10\">\u201cIf you\u2019re going to listen to Dr. Mark and Dr. Lieff and say, he\u2019s not responsible for that. I mean, the poor guy, he fell off a horse when he was ten. Come on, the poor guy.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-11\">\u201cWhat did Dr. Mark tell you? He tells you that, well, the first test I did, and they were done on, let\u2019s see, four years after the murder. Four years after the murder, I looked at his brain, did EEC\u2019s and CAT scans, and they were normal. But there\u2019s a new sophisticated test. I have all these pictures I\u2019ve pulled out. There\u2019s colors and lines and graphs and I saw some abnormality in the frontal lobe. So what? I said, doctor, did he have that back in \u201883? I don\u2019t know. How did he get the injury? I don\u2019t know. He doesn\u2019t know. What Dr. Mark said was very significant to him, I had him do a test where he had to open one hand and close the other hand and he couldn\u2019t do it.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-12\">\u201cI said, doctor, do you know he plays the guitar? Well, I didn\u2019t. Think he could load a gun? Think he could shoot a gun? Yes. Think he could drive a car? Yes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b773-13\">[4] \u201cAnd then, he brings in Dr. Lieff. Like a little dog and pony show. First the x-rays and then his little head specialist that comes in after, with all these doctors. And what did Dr. Lieff tell you? In my opinion, he couldn\u2019t control himself. Thank you, doctor. Do you care about what he did that day? Is that significant, I asked him. Is it significant how Julio <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"758\">*758</page-number>Cosme acted just before he killed his wife and brother and just after? You know what he said, not particularly.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-5\">\u201cThis man\u2019s a wizard. Dr. Lieff can look in his mind all by himself. He doesn\u2019t need to hear what he did. He doesn\u2019t need to talk to his friends. But he tells you, he can look in this man\u2019s mind as a psychiatrist, tell you, tell you, listen to me, folks, you don\u2019t understand. 1989, I can tell you what he was thinking in 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-6\">\u201cAnd what was his big significant point, the basis of his opinion? The most significant thing to him, the most significant thing to Dr. Lieff, remember what it was, the old distraction test. Remember what he said? He said, I had Mr. Cosme read numbers and letters and there\u2019s pictures of blood that were put in front of him and guns. And geez, it took him a long time to finish reading those numbers and letters. He said that is a significant basis of his opinion, that he couldn\u2019t control himself six years before.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-7\">\u201cDid that impress you? Is there a lot of common sense to that?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b774-8\">[5] \u201cRemember what Trooper Caulfield told you about the gun? The first latch, you can\u2019t shoot it. The second, no. It\u2019s got to be all the way back. You\u2019ve got to load it manually. I don\u2019t know. These doctors say he can\u2019t use his fingers and his hands. Look at this gun. He did a pretty good job loading it, didn\u2019t he? Twenty-two caliber. He was in such a rage that day.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-9\">\u201cDr. Lieff tells you, oh, it was terrible. He was in such a state, he was vomiting, he couldn\u2019t eat. What did Julio do before he killed them? He had a nice meal at the mother-in-law\u2019s and killed them after. I know what I have to do. Loaded the gun. Knew what he wanted to do every time he fired, do it again. Doel, two. Doel\u2019s still under the car trying to fix it. Three. It was the last to go, four.\"</p>\n<p id=\"b774-10\">[6] \u201cRemember what [Carmen\u2019s daughter] told you? She went over to pick her baby brother up and here\u2019s Julio, poor estranged husband, goes over to Carmen. Remember what Dr. Hori said? Close contact wounds? Hey, Carmen.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-11\">\u201cDoesn\u2019t that tell you everything you have to know? What does he do after he shoots them? Is he in some wild rage? Does he fall on the ground? Does he sit and cry? Does he? Does he fall on top his wife and go, Carmen, I love you, but I had to do it?</p>\n<p id=\"b774-12\">\u201cNo. Out of there, in his car. And what\u2019s he think about? This man, who, if you listen to the psychiatrists, he\u2019d be lucky if he could walk and talk. What does he do? Pulls around the corner, gets out, takes the gun, over the fence; gets the ammunition, over the fence. You think he knew what he was doing? Of course, he did. And what does he do? He goes to Waltham, to his friend Angel Santiago and tells Angel, I just shot her. He even remembered the wife may not be dead yet. But what did he tell Angel? Not only did he tell Angel that he shot them both, Angel said, why did you do it? Why did you do it? And remember what Angel told you?

I still don\u2019t know \u2014 I couldn\u2019t understand exactly what this brain injury they\u2019re talking about is, I don\u2019t think he could either, when I asked him. But if they do all these little shows with their hands, that tells him, that you should listen to him. You people don\u2019t know enough, listen to these experts; that\u2019s what he\u2019s telling you. Mr. Courtney says, they\u2019re so qualified. At what?</p>\n<p id=\"b775-5\">\u201cThey got common sense? Did they hear from the witnesses, like you did? No. You heard from them. You know more about this case than them. You know more about this case than anyone. You\u2019ve heard eye witnesses of this murder. You\u2019ve heard this case and you\u2019ve heard what this man did and you heard the way he acted. He knew what he was doing. He wanted to kill them. He wanted to kill them. He did. Shot them in the back. Did he have a reason? Did he have a motive? You don\u2019t need one but I think he has one.

An earlier appeal to this court was remanded for an evidentiary hearing which resulted in a new trial. At that time, this court did not reach the trial issues, or consider the case under G.

Dr. Kelly accepted a score of eighty-nine on a \u201cperformance\u201d test and rejected lower scores that depended on the defendant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"750\">*750</page-number>very limited background and schooling. He also stated that the defendant\u2019s functioning and behavior demonstrated no lack of understanding.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b767-6\">The argument of defendant\u2019s trial counsel on this point proceeded as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b767-7\">\u201cYou have to look at the testimony of Vernon Mark. You don\u2019t have to understand it. You just have to look at him, think of where he\u2019s been in his life. Ask yourself, does Vernon Mark take life seriously? Did Vernon Mark accomplish certain things during his life? Did Vernon Mark sit in front of you yesterday as an accomplished professional neurologist and neurosurgeon? Do you think Vernon Mark would come in here and say what he said, knowing his function in this case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b767-8\">\u201cAnd in the same vein, you have to assess Dr. Jonathan Lieff. Each of those doctors, as they approached their task, that is, to examine him, gathered together, I think they said \u2014 Well, I forget the numbers. One of them said four or five doctors, another one said four or five doctors, Each of their doctors \u2014 those doctors conducted a series of tests that took 20 to 25 hours.

You don\u2019t have to go in there, into the jury room, and say, yeah, I understand how someone could be so angry that they lose their ability to control themselves. That\u2019s not what those doctors were saying.

Although the defendant had a scar on the right front part of his head, the scar itself apparently did not reveal the nature of the wound that caused it. No medical records were obtained, or apparently sought, to determine the exact nature and degree of the injury. As the injury had been allegedly sustained in childhood, the defendant\u2019s recollections were not fresh. Moreover, the defendant, facing murder charges, could not be considered a disinterested source. There was no structural damage to the defendant\u2019s brain; the brain wave abnormalities were absent in 1987, though present in 1989; and many of the neurological tests used to assess the defendant\u2019s abilities were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"753\">*753</page-number>dependent on his cooperation.</p>\n<p id=\"axd-dedup-0\">Further, the prosecutor was entitled to exploit the fact that the defendant had deceived his psychiatrist about many of the circumstances of the shooting, a consideration that weakened the expert\u2019s opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b770-8\">The comment that psychiatrists were not needed in the case, see Appendix [2], is not in the same category.
