He ordered the school committee to reinstate a juvenile who had been suspended for one year in accordance with that policy. As the school committee and the superintendent of schools (superintendent) were not parties to that case, they filed a complaint pursuant to G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 3 (1990 ed.), seeking a stay of the order.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> A single justice stayed that order, and the case was reserved and reported to the full court. We conclude that the Juvenile Court judge lacked the authority to issue the order.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-10\">The Worcester Juvenile Court case began as a proceeding to determine whether a high school student was a \u201cchild in need of services\u201d within the meaning of G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 21 (1990 ed.). A complaint alleging that the student was a \u201cchild in need of services\u201d was filed pursuant to G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 39E (CHINS petition) in February, 1990. In October, 1990, the juvenile, a ninth grade student at a public high school in Worcester, was discovered to be in possession of a knife on school premises. Before the 1990-1991 school year began, the school committee had adopted a rule providing that any high school student bringing a weapon onto school <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"833\">*833</page-number>premises would be suspended for a minimum of twelve months. A hearing was held, at which the juvenile, her foster mother, and the principal of the school testified. The school committee then voted to suspend the juvenile for one year. In November, 1990, a hearing was held on the CHINS petition, and the court determined that the juvenile was \u201cin need of services.\u201d The court held a dispositional hearing as part of the CHINS proceeding in December, 1990.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-5\">The chairman of the school committee and the superintendent were subpoenaed to testify as witnesses at the CHINS dispositional hearing. The judge questioned these witnesses at length about the details of the policy. A Department of Social Services employee testified as to the juvenile\u2019s options during the suspension period: she could apply for a special needs evaluation, attend a private school, or attend public school in another school district. The school committee chairman also testified that, following the suspension, a student is offered extra tutoring and summer school to aid in catching up. Following the hearing, the Juvenile Court judge issued a dispositional order in the CHINS proceeding ordering that the juvenile was to continue to reside with her father, and ordering the school committee and the superintendent to reinstate the juvenile immediately and to provide her with remedial instruction. The judge based his reinstatement order on his conclusion that the school committee\u2019s action in expelling the juvenile for a year was invalid as a matter of State constitutional law.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-6\">The plaintiffs filed motions before the Juvenile Court judge requesting a stay of the order pending appeal and requesting amendment of the order deleting references to the plaintiffs. The judge denied the motions. The school committee and the superintendent then filed the present complaint pursuant to G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 3, naming the Juvenile Court judge as defendant. See note 2, <em>supra. </em>The complaint requested a stay of the order and reversal of those portions of the order that related to the school committee. A single justice stayed the order. In March, 1991, another single justice reserved and reported the case, without decision, to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"834\">*834</page-number>1. <em>Review, pursuant to G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 3. </em>In general, \u201c[t]he supervisory power of this court is used sparingly. . . .\u201d <em>Parents of Two Minors </em>v. <em>Bristol Div. of the Juvenile Court Dep\u2019t, </em>397 Mass. 846, 849 (1986), quoting <em>Soja </em>v. <em>T.P. Sampson Co., </em>373 Mass. 630, 631 (1977). However, we agree with the plaintiffs\u2019 assertion that this is an appropriate case in which to exercise that power. The plaintiffs were not parties to the CHINS proceeding. General Laws c. 119, \u00a7 391 (1990 ed.), provides a right of appeal for a child who is adjudicated in need of services. Section 391 does not provide an avenue of relief to the school committee or the superintendent. In these circumstances, we consider that review under c. 211, \u00a7 3, is appropriate. See <em>Parents of Two Minors, supra </em>at 849-850. See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gordon, ante </em>498, 499 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b850-5\">2. <em>Authority of the Juvenile Court to issue the order. </em>The plaintiffs contend that the Juvenile Court judge acted beyond his authority when he found the school committee policy to be unconstitutional and ordered the school committee to reinstate the juvenile. The Juvenile Court argues that Juvenile. Court jurisdiction supporting the ruling is provided by G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 39G, or, alternatively, by G. L. c. 218, \u00a7 59 (1990 ed.). We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-6\">We examine the arguments put forth by the Juvenile Court to determine whether, in this particular case, the jurisdiction of the Juvenile Court extends to the ruling that was made. \u201cThe Juvenile Courts, like all the courts of the Commonwealth, except the Supreme Judicial Court, are creatures of the Legislature and derive their powers, other than those powers that are inherent in all courts, . . . from the Legislature\u201d (citations omitted). <em>Parents of Two Minors, supra </em>at 851. Legislative grants of power \u201cmust either be articulated expressly or be capable of being deduced by \u2018necessary and inevitable\u2019 implication.\u201d <em>Police Comm\u2019r of Boston </em>v. <em>Municipal Court of the Dorchester Dist., </em>374 Mass. 640, 663 (1978), quoting <em>Mountfort </em>v. <em>Hall, </em>1 Mass. 443, 457 (1805). <em>Parents of Two Minors, supra </em>at 851. Implied powers have been recognized as \u201cinherent\u201d in courts where the power is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"835\">*835</page-number>necessary to allow the court to function. <em>Police Comm\u2019r of Boston, supra </em>at 664, citing <em>O\u2019Coin\u2019s, Inc. </em>v. <em>Treasurer of the County of Worcester, </em>362 Mass. 507 (1972). Implied powers also have been recognized as ancillary to a specific grant of jurisdiction, where the power is necessary so as not to \u201cdeny the existence of a jurisdiction which was intended by the Legislature to be given.\u201d <em>Police Comm\u2019r of Boston, supra </em>at 663, quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>New York Cent. &amp; H.R. R.R., </em>206 Mass. 417, 429 (1910). \u201cThe primary purpose of recognizing ancillary jurisdiction is to ensure that a particular court judgment is given complete and final effect.\u201d <em>Police Comm\u2019r of Boston, supra </em>at 664.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-4\">\u201c[Wjithin their respective jurisdictions,\u201d the Juvenile Courts have the same powers as the District Courts. G. L. c. 218, \u00a7 59 (1990 ed.). The Juvenile Courts thus have exclusive jurisdiction \u201cover cases of juvenile offenders under seventeen and cases of neglected, wayward or delinquent children\u201d and cases referred to them under G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 4A. See G. L. c. 218, \u00a7 60 (1990 ed.); <em>Parents of Two Minors, supra </em>at 852. The Juvenile Courts also have full equity jurisdiction \u201cin all cases and matters arising under [c. 119].\u201d G. L. c. 218, \u00a7 59 (1990 ed.).</p>\n<p id=\"b851-5\">The judge issued the ruling challenged here in the course of a CHINS proceeding conducted pursuant to G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 39G.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> This section authorizes the court to adjudge the juvenile to be \u201cin need of services\u201d and, \u201ctaking into consideration the physical and emotional welfare of the child\u201d to make \u201cany of the following orders of disposition: (a) subject to any conditions and limitations the court may prescribe, including provision for . . . educational . . . services . . . permit the child to remain with his parents; (b) . . . place the child in the care of any of the following [qualified individuals or agencies]; or (c) . . . commit the child to the department of social services.\u201d G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 39G (1990 ed.).</p>\n<p id=\"b852-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"836\">*836</page-number>The Juvenile Court asserts first that the plain language of \u00a7 39G provides jurisdiction for the ruling. The Juvenile Court points to the authorization to issue a dispositional order, the authorization to condition such an order on the provision of educational services, and the authorization to consider the welfare of the juvenile in making the order. The Juvenile Court argues that this combination results in an authorization to inquire into the validity of any obstacle to the delivery of services to the juvenile and to issue any order necessary to remove an obstacle. We recently have considered the language of \u00a7 39G in assessing the validity of another order issued under that section. See <em>Matter of Vincent, </em>408 Mass. 527 (1990). We held in that case that \u00a7 39G authorized the judge to make an order determining the custody of a juvenile, and to make the custody subject to various conditions, but that \u00a7 39G does not authorize a judge to order a juvenile directly to attend school. <em>Id. </em>at 531-532. Similarly, we conclude here that the language of \u00a7 39G authorizing a judge to make orders determining custody and placing limitations on custody is not sufficiently broad to authorize a judge to raise and rule on the constitutionality of a school committee policy and then to order the school committee directly to reinstate an expelled juvenile on that basis. See <em>id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b852-4\">The Juvenile Court argues further that, even if authorization to issue this order does not appear in the language of \u00a7 39G, such power is implied by the language of the provision in combination with the legislative intent behind it. The Juvenile Court relies heavily on <em>Police Comm\u2019r of Boston, supra, </em>in which we held that a Juvenile Court has the power to order police to expunge certain records of juveniles. In that case, we determined that \u201cthe power to order expungement or its equivalent, ... is a power that properly may be exercised by the courts of the Commonwealth as a necessary adjunct to their exercise of judicial power\u201d (footnote and citation omitted). <em>Police Comm\u2019r of Boston, supra </em>at 661. We then examined the language of G. L. c. 119, \u00a7\u00a7 52-63, which govern delinquency proceedings against juveniles, to determine whether a fair reading of the applicable statutes re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"837\">*837</page-number>vealed an implied power in the Juvenile Court to order ex-pungement of juvenile police records. We noted the broad language of c. 119, \u00a7 53, directing that the statute governing delinquency proceedings be liberally construed, and that the juveniles not be treated as criminals. After examining that language, and other sections relating to delinquency proceedings, we concluded that the delinquency proceeding statutes implied that the Juvenile Court had the power to order ex-pungement of juvenile records.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-5\">The case before us arises, however, under different statutory provisions. The provisions governing CHINS proceedings, G. L. c. 119, \u00a7\u00a7 39E-39I, outline the procedure for adjudicating a child \u201cin need of services\u201d and authorize the court to make custody orders subject to limitations, but do not contain the broad language contained in G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 53. See <em>Matter of Vincent, supra. </em>Furthermore, the circumstances of this case do not support the contention that the Juvenile Court had inherent power to make this ruling because it could not otherwise fulfil its judicial function. The judge\u2019s findings of fact recite three options for continuing her schooling which are open to the juvenile: she can attend a private school, she can move into another school district, or she can request evaluation as a special needs student. The record does not disclose any fact permitting a determination that the three options are insufficient to meet the needs of this juvenile. .The judge could have fulfilled his duty in the CHINS proceeding by incorporating one of those options into his dispositional order. The school committee has never declined to educate the juvenile. It merely bars the use of the Worcester public schools, where the infraction took place, for one year. Therefore, no inherent power allowed the court to exceed the authority granted in \u00a7 39G. See <em>Parents of Two Minors, supra </em>at 853. Because the power to determine the constitutionality of a school committee policy and to issue an order to the school committee is not inherent in the court and is not necessarily and inevitably implied by G. L. c. 119, \u00a7\u00a7 39E-39I, see <em>Police Comm\u2019r of Boston, supra </em>at 663, the Ju<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"838\">*838</page-number>venile Court exceeded its jurisdictional power in issuing the order.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-5\">Other cases cited by the Juvenile Court are not to the contrary. We have held that c. 119, \u00a7\u00a7 24 and 26, implicitly authorize a judge to order a hospital to enter a \u201cno code\u201d order for an infant, <em>Custody of a Minor (No. 1), </em>385 Mass. 697 (1982), and to order parents to allow their child to undergo chemotherapy, <em>Custody of a Minor, </em>375 Mass. 733 (1978). However, \u00a7 26 authorizes a court to \u201cmake any other appropriate order with reference to the care and custody of the child as may conduce to his best interests.\u201d G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 26 (1990 ed.). The CHINS provisions do not contain this broad language. Furthermore, the orders issued in the above cited cases did not depend on a prior constitutional ruling affecting parties not before the court. The cases are thus inapposite.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-6\">The Juvenile Court argues that the equity jurisdiction conferred by G. L. c. 218, \u00a7 59, provides a separate, alternate source of authority for the judge\u2019s order. That equity jurisdiction, however, is limited to \u201ccases and matters arising under the provisions of [c. 119].\u201d G. L. c. 218, \u00a7 59 (1990 ed.). As we stated above, the section of c. 119 under which this case arose concerns only orders of disposition, and does not authorize the court to examine the constitutionality of a school committee policy. The grant of equitable powers under c. 218, \u00a7 59, does not permit a Juvenile Court to extend its jurisdiction beyond the limits established by c. 119.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-7\">Finally, the Juvenile Court argues that judicial economy would be best served by determining the validity of the school committee policy when a juvenile affected by the policy is before the court. While \u201cpractical considerations in favor of judicial economy and against piecemeal litigation\u201d play some role in determining the extent of a court\u2019s ancillary jurisdiction, <em>Police Comm\u2019r of Boston, supra </em>at 664, those considerations are not relevant in this case. It would be specious economy to decide a constitutional issue in the absence of necessary parties and a factual record. See <em>School Comm. of Springfield </em>v. <em>Board of Educ., </em>362 Mass. 417, 445 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"839\">*839</page-number>(1972). See also <em>Worcester Vocational Teachers Ass\u2019n </em>v. <em>Worcester, </em>13 Mass. App. Ct. 1, 8 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b855-5\">The case is remanded to single justice. A judgment shall be entered directing the Juvenile Court to vacate the portions of the order which refer to the plaintiffs, and to proceed in a manner consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b848-11\">Pursuant to G.
