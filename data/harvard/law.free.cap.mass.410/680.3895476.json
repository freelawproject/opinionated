On March 16, 1990, the defendant filed a motion in Superior Court for scientific testing of certain physical evidence in the Commonwealth\u2019s possession. Professing his indigence, the defendant also moved <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>for the award of $3,000 to cover the cost of the testing pursuant to G. L. c. 261, \u00a7 27C (4) (1990 ed.) (regarding costs to indigents).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The trial judge allowed the motion for testing, but denied the motion for costs. The defendant appealed from the denial of the motion for costs to the Appeals Court.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We transferred the case to this court on our own motion, and we now reject the defendant\u2019s appeal for procedural reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-4\">The facts are set out in detail in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Davis, supra. </em>Here we recite only those facts necessary to decide this appeal. The victim\u2019s body was found, naked and badly beaten, in an outdoor stairwell at Lowell City Hall on February 10, 1985. Several strands of hair were found in the victim\u2019s hands. At trial, the Commonwealth offered the expert testimony of a chemist who had examined the hair. According to the expert, the hair had not come from the head of the defendant, but may have come from the victim\u2019s own head.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The trial ended on March 25, 1986.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-5\">In 1988, according to the defendant\u2019s motion, geneticists announced the discovery of a new technique for the analysis <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>of DNA in hair.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The motion suggested that this technique, the polymerase chain reaction method (PCR method), \u201ccan exclude with 100% certainty any particular individual as being the donor of any particular strand of hair.\u201d The defendant also submitted the affidavit of a scientist who concluded, \u201c[T]here is a high degree of likelihood that the PCR method of testing would obtain DNA from each of the strands of hair [discovered in the victim\u2019s hands] . . . and that the donor of each strand could be identified by the DNA thus obtained.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b698-5\">Invoking the statute authorizing the award of certain costs to indigents, G. L. c. 261, \u00a7 27C (4), the defendant moved for the award of $3,000 to cover the expense of PCR testing. The results, he argued, would establish that the hair in the victim\u2019s hands came from neither the defendant nor the victim, but from a third person \u2014 the murderer, the defendant implied. Thus, the defendant asserted that the test results would constitute newly discovered evidence sufficient to support a motion for a new trial. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Moore, </em>408 Mass. 117, 126-127 (1990), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Grace, </em>397 Mass. 303, 305-306 (1986) (standards governing grant of new trial based on newly discovered evidence).</p>\n<p id=\"b698-6\">The judge denied the motion, finding that the defendant\u2019s trial counsel ably exposed deficiencies in the Commonwealth\u2019s forensic evidence, and that the results of the PCR testing would merely be cumulative of evidence showing that the hair in the victim\u2019s hands was not the defendant\u2019s. In addition, the judge found that DNA testing was available at the time of trial. The judge allowed the defendant\u2019s motion for access to the evidence, however, if the defendant wished to finance the testing himself. On appeal, the defendant ar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>gues that the judge erred in denying his petition for \u201cextra fees and costs\u201d under c. 261, \u00a7 27C (4), because the PCR testing was \u201creasonably necessary to prevent the [defendant] from being subjected to a disadvantage in preparing or presenting his case adequately, in comparison with one who could afford to pay for the preparation which the case reasonably requires.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Lockley, 381 Mass. 156, 160-161 (1980) (standard for deciding whether indigent\u2019s request for costs should be granted).</p>\n<p id=\"b699-4\">The case is not properly before this court because the defendant failed to comply with the \u201cgatekeeper\u201d provision of G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E (1990 ed.).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> *8 That provision expressly prohibits an appeal from \u201cany motion\u201d filed in the Superior Court after \u00a7 33E review without the leave of a single justice of this court. \u201cInterests of judicial economy are best served by having a single justice \u2018screen out\u2019 postconviction motions which do not present a \u2018new or substantial question.\u2019 In this manner, a full quorum of the Supreme Judicial Court is spared the task of hearing frivolous or duplicative claims.\u201d <em>Dickerson </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen., </em>396 Mass. 740, 744-745 (1986). See <em>Leaster </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>385 Mass. 547 (1982). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lanoue, </em>409 Mass. 1, 8 (1990) (O\u2019Connor, J., concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b699-5\">The defendant notes that G. L. c. 261, \u00a7 27D, directs his appeal to the Appeals Court. Section 27D provides that, where a Superior Court judge denies a motion for the Commonwealth to pay an indigent\u2019s costs pursuant to c. 261, \u00a7 27C, the applicant\u2019s appeal lies to the single justice of the Appeals Court. See note 2, <em>supra. </em>Thus, the two statutes \u2014 c. 261, \u00a7 27D, and c. 278, \u00a7 33E \u2014 appear to steer the defendant\u2019s appeal to different courts. In this situation, we hold that the gatekeeper provision of \u00a7 33E, which specifically ad<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>dresses postconviction motions brought by defendants in capital cases, is applicable. See <em>Boston </em>v. <em>Board of Educ., </em>392 Mass. 788, 792 (1984) (allegedly inconsistent statutes are construed to give reasonable effect to both and to create a consistent body of law).</p>\n<p id=\"b700-5\">The defendant\u2019s appeal is therefore dismissed. Because the defendant\u2019s motion raises issues that are likely to reoccur in the future, however, we express our opinion on the defendant\u2019s substantive claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-6\">Chapter 261, \u00a7 27C (4), assures an indigent defendant of those costs \u201creasonably necessary to assure [him] as effective a prosecution, defense or appeal as he would have if he were financially able to pay.\u201d The defendant\u2019s motion for costs, however, is not aimed at a \u201cprosecution, defense or appeal\u201d; it contemplates a possible motion for a new trial after the defendant\u2019s initial, unsuccessful defense and appeal.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Thus, the defendant\u2019s motion for the costs of PCR testing is not cognizable under c. 261, \u00a7 27 C (4), because the funds sought are not related to a pending trial or appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-7\">We acknowledge that \u00a7 27C may work a hardship on convicted indigents seeking the funds to carry out a newly discovered scientific technique which could yield exculpatory evidence. In such circumstances, funds to pay for scientific testing under \u00a7 27 C are not available until a new trial is granted, yet there may be no grounds to move for a new trial without the test results. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pope, </em>392 Mass. 493, 497 n.5 (1984) (grounds for seeking new trial must be raised in motion); Mass. R. Crim. P. 30 (b), (c) (2), 378 Mass. 900 (1979). Where the Legislature has chosen not to fund certain procedures not constitutionally mandated, however, this court may not rewrite the statute to do so.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b701-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>This appeal is dismissed because it is not properly before us, having never been allowed by the single justice of this court as \u00a7 33E requires. Although the defendant is free to seek an appeal before the single justice, he is unlikely to succeed there since the single justice will be guided by this opinion. Of course, nothing in this opinion prevents the defendant from carrying out the PCR testing at his own expense.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b697-6\">General Laws c. 261, \u00a7 27C (4), reads in relevant part: \u201cIf the court makes a finding of indigency ... it shall not deny any request with respect to extra fees and costs if it finds the document, service or object is reasonably necessary to assure the applicant as effective a prosecution, defense or appeal as he would have if he were financially able to pay.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b697-7\">The defendant submitted an affidavit stating that he had been found indigent by the court prior to his trial and that he still lacked the means to pay for the tests. The Commonwealth does not contest these assertions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b697-8\">The case was docketed so as to be heard before a panel of the Appeals Court. The Commonwealth notes that G. L. c. 261, \u00a7 27D (1990 ed.), directs an appeal from a Superior Court judge\u2019s denial of costs under c. 261, \u00a7 27C (4), to a single justice of the Appeals Court. Our conclusion in this case makes it unnecessary to decide the effect of this procedural impropriety.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b697-9\">In our earlier opinion, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>supra, we stated in the margin that \u201cthe hair [removed from the victim\u2019s hands] was found to be the victim\u2019s own hair.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 583 n.14. The defendant argues that expert testimony at trial suggested only that the hair was \u201cconsistent with being\u201d the victim\u2019s own. The distinction does not affect the outcome of this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b698-7\">\u2018Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is the material that determines genetic characteristics of life forms.

The DNA of each person, except for identical twins, is unique, although, as might be expected, there are substantial similarities in the DNA in any species. The variation in human DNA is what makes an individual\u2019s DNA unique and permits meaningful DNA testing.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Curnin, </em>409 Mass. 218, 218 n.l (1991).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b699-6\">The relevant portion of \u00a7 33E reads: \u201cIf any motion [in a capital case] is filed in the superior court after rescript, no appeal shall lie from the decision of that court upon such motion unless the appeal is allowed by a single justice of the supreme judicial court on the ground that it presents a new and substantial question which ought to be determined by the full court.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b700-8\">Of course a motion for postconviction relief under Mass.

If indigent prisoners have no due process or equal protection right to appointed counsel in preparing or presenting a motion for new trial, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Conceicao, </em>388 Mass. 255, 261 (1983); <em>Dirring </em>v. <em>United States, </em>353 F.2d 519, 520 (1st Cir. 1965); <em>Germany </em>v. <em>Vance, </em>673 F.Supp. 1143, 1147 (D.
