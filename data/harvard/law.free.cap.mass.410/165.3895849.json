L. c. 32B (1988 ed.), and Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Massachusetts, Inc. (Blue Cross/Blue Shield), from whom they purchase the plans. Pursuant to G. L. c. 231A (1988 ed.), the plaintiffs sought a declaration that art. 115 permits the towns to exclude the mandated benefits from their contracts with Blue Cross/Blue Shield.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The Attorney General asserted counterclaims against Blue Cross/ <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>Blue Shield for enforcement of the challenged statutes. The parties filed a statement of agreed facts and a joint motion to report the case, without decision, to the Appeals Court. The trial judge granted the motion. Subsequently, we granted the plaintiffs\u2019 application for direct appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">The six challenged statutes mandate the following benefits: PAP smears (screening for cervical cancer) and mammography (screening for breast cancer), St. 1987, c. 363; preventive and primary care services for children, St. 1988, c. 23, \u00a7\u00a7 48, 52, and 60; lead poison screening for children, St. 1987, c. 773; nonprescription enteral formulas for Chrohn\u2019s disease and ulcerative colitis, St. 1987, c. 683; diagnosis and treatment of infertility, St. 1987, c. 394; and chiropractic services, St. 1987, c. 711.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">With the exception of St. 1988, c. 23 (preventive and primary care services for children), which passed by a simple majority in both houses of the Legislature, the challenged statutes were enacted by voice vote in each house, and there was no record made of the number of members of either house present and voting either for or against the statutes. The Legislature did not provide for assumption by the Commonwealth of the additional costs to the towns that may result from application of the statutes. The towns have not accepted these statutes, either by vote or appropriation.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-7\">The current group health insurance contract between the city of Cambridge and Blue Cross/Blue Shield includes all of the benefits mandated by the challenged statutes except those for chiropractic services and infertility treatment.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The current group health insurance contracts between the other municipalities and Blue Cross/Blue Shield cover all six of the benefits mandated by the challenged statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-8\">Pursuant to the Home Rule Amendment, art. 89, the Legislature was authorized to make the application of certain laws to a particular municipality dependent on approval by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>the voters of that municipality. General Laws c. 32B, requiring municipalities to purchase group health insurance plans for their employees and to pay at least fifty percent of the premiums for the plans, was such a \u201clocal option\u201d statute. Like the statute establishing retirement systems and pensions for municipal employees, G. L. c. 32B is irrevocable once accepted. G. L. c. 32B, \u00a7 10. G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 4B (c) (1988 ed.). All of the municipal plaintiffs in this case accepted G. L. c. 32B by local vote.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">Since insurance companies (in this case, Blue Cross/Blue Shield) will seek to raise their premiums* ***<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> to the extent necessary to cover the cost of the mandated benefits, the challenged statutes will result in additional costs to the municipalities who contribute a portion of the premiums for their employees\u2019 health insurance. The plaintiffs argue that, because the municipalities are obligated under G. L. c. 32B to purchase group health insurance, and the challenged statutes require every group health plan sold to cover the mandated benefits, the municipalities have no choice but to provide such benefits for their employees. They claim, therefore, that although the statutes regulate insurance plans, in effect they also constitute \u201cregulation [s]\u201d of the benefits of municipal employment \u201cimposing additional costs\u201d upon the municipalities. Finally, since the costs were not assumed by the Commonwealth, and the record does not demonstrate that the statutes were passed by a two-thirds vote of the Legislature<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> or accepted by the municipalities, the plaintiffs claim their application to municipal group health insurance plans violates art. 115. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-6\">We begin by briefly reviewing the background of art. 115. The collective bargaining law passed in 1973, and codified as G. L. c. 150E (1988 ed.), which broadened the scope of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>terms negotiable in collective bargaining between municipal employers and employees, also originally provided for binding interest arbitration of labor disputes between municipalities and police officer or fire fighter groups. St. 1973, c. 1078, \u00a7 4. In <em>Arlington </em>v. <em>Board of Conciliation and Arbitration, </em>370 Mass. 769 (1976), the town of Arlington challenged arbitration awards made pursuant to that provision which established the year\u2019s wages, vacation pay, sick leave, and other conditions of employment for Arlington\u2019s police and fire fighters. This court ruled that the binding arbitration procedure was not violative of \u00a7 8 of the Home Rule Amendment, because \u201cthe General Court has the power to legislate in the area of municipal wages and benefits.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>Arlington, supra </em>at 774. In response to the town\u2019s public policy arguments pointing out the undesirability of binding arbitration, this court stated that \u201c[p] articular political, social, and economic beliefs, no matter how fervently espoused, are not translated into constitutional imperatives <em>without reference to specific constitutional provisions </em>... We see no constitutional impediment to the Legislature\u2019s structuring municipal labor relations in the manner provided in the act.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Id. </em>at 780.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">Article 115, which originated in the 1977 joint legislative session soon after the decision in <em>Arlington, </em>provided the \u201cspecific constitutional provision\u201d required by <em>Arlington </em>to overcome the binding arbitration law. The argument for the amendment (Question 5 on the ballot) that appeared in the Voter Information Supplement issued by the State Secretary said, in part, that \u201cif a mandate <em>concerning municipal employee salaries or benefits </em>is passed without full state funding or without a % vote of each house, then voters and taxpayers within each city or town would have the right to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>decide whether or not they want to spend the additional money in their community to fund the new law\u201d (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">Article 115 limits the Legislature\u2019s power to regulate the terms. of municipal employment. Like the Home Rule Amendment, however, it did not limit the Legislature\u2019s ability to enact laws for the general welfare. In considering the meaning of \u00a7 8 of the Home Rule Amendment, prior to the addition of art. 115, this court stated, \u201cWe do not interpret the words \u2018to act in relation to cities and towns\u2019 as precluding the Legislature from acting on matters of State, regional, or general concern, even though such action may have special effect upon one or more individual cities or towns. If the predominant purposes of a bill are to achieve State, regional, or general objectives, we think that, . . . the Legislature possesses legislative power, unaffected by the restrictions in art. 89, \u00a7 8.\u201d <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>356 Mass. 775, 787-788 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b186-6\">Article 115 was adopted by popular vote the same day as G. L. c. 29, \u00a7 27C (1988 ed.), the \u201clocal mandate\u201d provision of Proposition 2Vz:<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Subsection (c) of the \u201clocal mandate\u201d provision was similar to art. 115 in that it barred the effectiveness of any rule or regulation \u201cwhich shall result in the imposition of additional costs upon any city or town\u201d without the assumption by the Commonwealth of those costs. G. L. c. 29, \u00a7 27 C (c).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> We have held that reading subsection (c) \u201cto include indirect costs which result from agency regulation . . . would widen the scope of Proposition <em>2Vi </em>beyond <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>that which was intended.\u201d <em>Norfolk </em>v. <em>Department of Envtl. Quality Eng\u2019g, </em>407 Mass. 233, 240 (1990). At issue in <em>Norfolk </em>was an environmental regulation requiring installation of an impervious liner to protect groundwater from contamination, prior to expansion of any landfill. We held that Proposition <em>2V2 </em>does not exempt municipalities from generally applicable laws or regulations, governing activities engaged in by private businesses, which result in indirect costs to those municipalities voluntarily engaging in such activity. <em>Id. </em>at 238, 241. Since the town of Norfolk chose to operate a landfill and to expand it, the costs resulting from the environmental regulation were not \u201cimposed\u201d according to the meaning of G. L. c. 29, \u00a7 27C (c). <em>Id. </em>at 239.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">Mandated benefits laws are designed to ensure the availability of certain benefits considered necessary for the public welfare and which otherwise, because of a distorted insurance market, might not be offered or might have a prohibitively high cost.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> See <em>Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Massachusetts, </em>471 U.S. 724, 731 (1985) (discussing mandated benefits for treatment of mental illness). We do not think these generally applicable insurance regulations constitute the type of \u201cregulation ... of municipal employment\u201d contemplated by art. 115. That article was not intended to exempt a municipality from laws of general applicability, governing private businesses and individuals as well as public purchasers of health insurance, which result in indirect costs to those municipalities voluntarily providing such insurance. Cf. <em>Norfolk </em>v. <em>Department of Envtl. Quality Eng\u2019g, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b187-6\">The municipalities claim their provision of group health insurance is not \u201cvoluntary.\u201d It is true that, once having ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>cepted the obligation to provide health care benefits to its employees according to the provisions of c. 32B, a town cannot later \u201copt out\u201d of that obligation the way \"the town of Norfolk could presumably cease operating its landfill. However, the fact that G. L. c. 32B is irrevocable once accepted does not affect the voluntariness of the acceptance.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Moreover, in the same election which adopted art. 115 and Proposition <em>2Vz, </em>the voters also adopted a statute which, while allowing a municipality to revoke its acceptance of certain local option statutes, specifically continued the prohibition against revocation of acceptance of G. L. c. 32B. See G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 4B.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Compare <em>Everett Retirement Bd. </em>v. <em>Assessors of Everett, </em>19 Mass. App. Ct. 305, 308 (1985) (the insulation of municipal retirement systems- from Proposition <em>2Vi </em>is confirmed by G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 4B, which permits municipalities to revoke acceptance of a State law so as to extricate themselves from the accompanying financial obligations, but expressly excludes G. L. c. 32, governing municipal retirement systems, from that revocation option). It was apparent, when the municipalities accepted the obligation to purchase group insurance plans for their employees, that such plans were and would be subject to generally applicable insurance regulations which might cause premiums to rise. If the municipalities (or Blue Cross/Blue Shield) do not agree with the Legislature that the public interest is served by mandating certain benefits, such as coverage for chiropractic services or infertility treatment, then the Legislature is the proper forum for attempting to avoid those benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">One final point: the plaintiffs charge that application of the mandated benefits statutes to municipal employees\u2019 group health insurance contracts violates G. L. c. 150E, under which the \u201cwages, hours, standards or productivity and per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>formance, and any other terms and conditions of employment\u201d of municipal employees are to be determined by collective bargaining with municipal employers. See <em>School Comm. of Medford </em>v. <em>Labor Relations Comm\u2019n, </em>8 Mass. App. Ct. 139, 140 (1979), <em>S.C., </em>380 Mass. 932 (1980) (health insurance benefits are within the category of \u201cconditions of employment\u201d subject to collective bargaining under G. L. c. 150E, \u00a7 6). The statutes listed by G. L. c. 150E, \u00a7 7, as being superseded by collective bargaining agreements deal exclusively with specific terms or conditions of public employment. None of them are generally applicable statutes such as the ones at issue here. Municipal employers and employees may not negotiate to avoid complying with laws of general applicability, including insurance regulations. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Labor Relations Comm\u2019n, </em>404 Mass. 124, 126 (1989) (statutes not specifically enumerated in G. L. c. 150E, \u00a7 7 <em>[d], </em>will prevail over contrary terms in collective bargaining agreements).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">We therefore declare that the provision of art. 115 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights does not render ineffective the statutes challenged in this action.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b182-31\">The Attorney General does not claim that the municipalities may not challenge the constitutionality of the statutes and we do not therefore reach the issue.

The \u201clocal mandate\u201d provision was a response to the enactment by the Legislature, in the 1970s, of a number of statutes which imposed substantial costs on municipalities without the assumption of those costs by the Commonwealth.

In addition, the cost of coverage for some conditions, such as infertility, may be prohibitively high because \u201cgood-risk\u201d individuals do not purchase coverage, thus driving up the price of coverage for those who would otherwise purchase it.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b188-6\">The fact that, according to the plaintiffs, G.
