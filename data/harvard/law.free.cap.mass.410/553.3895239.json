White\u2019s complaint alleged gender discrimination in violation of G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 4 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>(1988 ed.),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-2 (1990).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> She alleged further that she was wrongfully terminated from a full-time teaching position at the University because of her sex; that there was retaliatory termination due to her filing discrimination charges with the University and with the Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination (MCAD); that termination of her employment by the University was in bad faith; and that Clarke maliciously interfered with her advantageous employment relations and violated her civil rights. White sought reinstatement in her teaching and counselling position at the University, compensatory damages, and related injunctive relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-5\">On September 12, 1989, the defendants submitted a motion for summary judgment pursuant to Mass. R. Civ. P. 56 (b), 365 Mass. 824 (1974). A judge in the Superior Court granted the motion for summary judgment on all counts and ordered the complaint dismissed. The plaintiff appeals the grant of summary judgment as to the counts of discrimination in employment and retaliation by the University and Clarke, and malicious interference with advantageous employment relations by Clarke. We transferred the appeal to this court on our own motion. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-6\"><em>Facts. </em>The following facts are not in dispute. In 1979, White began working as an English teacher and counselor in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>the University\u2019s Veterans Education and Training Program (VET Program). When White learned that she was pregnant, in December, 1986, she notified the supervisor of the VET Program, Charles Diggs, and his supervisor, Kevin Bowen, co-director of the University\u2019s Joiner Center for War and Social Consequences. Although the standard period allowed under University policy for maternity leave was eight weeks, White was able to arrange an eight-month leave, during the spring and summer semesters of 1987.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> White\u2019s then-existing employment contract would expire at the end of the leave of absence, on August 31, 1987.</p>\n<p id=\"APK\">On May 29, 1987, Alan Clarke notified White by letter that he did \u201cnot intend to recommend that [her] contract be renewed in its present form\u201d in order \u201cto provide the University with sufficient flexibility to implement the best possible program design.\u201d The notice also provided that White would be \u201caccorded preferential treatment in the filling of whatever positions emerge[d].\u201d In July, White requested a further extension of her leave of absence or, alternatively, a part-time teaching position, through the fall semester, 1987.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> White\u2019s supervisor approved the request, with reservations, in a letter addressed to Clarke dated August 11, 1987.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Clarke responded to White\u2019s request by a letter dated August. 14, 1987. In the letter, Clarke denied the request for part-time employment,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> but stated that he \u201clookfed] forward to having <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>[White] rejoin the staff of the Veterans Educational Training Program on a full-time basis.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Unable to arrange for her child\u2019s care prior to September 1, 1987, White did not return to work for the fall semester.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">In November, 1987, White filed a grievance with the University\u2019s affirmative action office seeking clarification of her job status. On January 11, 1988, White filed a charge of gender discrimination with the Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination (MCAD) alleging, inter alia, that in June, 1987, Clarke terminated her position without cause or notice. In a letter dated February 25, 1988, Clarke denied ever having terminated White\u2019s position, stating that he offered to renew White\u2019s full-time contract beginning in September, 1987, but she turned the offer down. Clarke\u2019s letter further provided: \u201cTo the best of my knowledge, you have no employment status at the University.\u201d Subsequently, White amended her discrimination charge with the MCAD to include a charge of retaliation, alleging that Clarke, by the February 25 letter, terminated her employment at the University because she had filed discrimination charges with the University and the MCAD.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b572-6\"><em>Motion for summary judgment. </em>Summary judgment \u201cshall be rendered forthwith if the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Mass. R. Civ. P. 56 (c), 365 Mass. 824 (1974). On appeal, an \u201corder granting summary judgment against [the non-moving party] thus will be upheld if certain factors converge to convince us that the trial judge was ruling in this case on undisputed facts and, of course, that his rulings were correct as matter of law.\u201d <em>Community </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number><em>Nat\u2019l Bank </em>v. <em>Dawes, </em>369 Mass. 550, 556 (1976). We view the evidence and the inferences to be drawn therefrom in the light most favorable to the opposing party. <em>Id. </em>at 559 n.8.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">The pivotal element of each claim asserted by White is the allegation that she was terminated. White\u2019s first claim, on appeal, is that she was discriminated against on the basis of her sex and because she had recently been pregnant, and that the discrimination resulted in the termination of her employment at the University. The analysis of a discrimination claim is essentially the same under the State and Federal statutes. See <em>Wheelock College </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Comm\u2019n Against Discrimination, </em>371 Mass. 130, 135 &amp; n.5 (1976); <em>Radvilas </em>v. <em>Stop &amp; Shop, Inc., </em>18 Mass. App. Ct. 431, 438-439 (1984). In order to establish a prima facie case of sex discrimination resulting in termination of employment, White must establish that (1) she is a member of a protected group; (2) she performed her job at an acceptable level; (3) she was terminated; and (4) her employer sought a replacement with similar qualifications. See <em>Duke </em>v. <em>Uniroyal Inc., </em>928 F.2d 1413 (4th Cir. 1991) (standard applied in challenge of termination on basis of age discrimination). See also <em>Wheelock College, supra </em>at 135 n.5, citing <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp. </em>v. <em>Green, </em>411 U.S. 792, 802 n.13 (1973) (facts necessary to establish prima facie case of discrimination will vary depending on situation).</p>\n<p id=\"b573-6\">Asserting a claim based on sex discrimination as a pregnant woman, White is a member of a protected group. See <em>Massachusetts Elec. Co. </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Comm\u2019n Against Discrimination, </em>375 Mass. 160, 167 (1978), citing <em>General Elec. Co. </em>v. <em>Gilbert, </em>429 U.S. 125, 149 (1976) (Brennan, J\u201e dissenting) (classification relying on pregnancy is distinction based on sex). There was also evidence that she performed her job at an acceptable level, prior to her extended leave of absence beginning in February, 1987. There is no evidence, however, that White was terminated from her position.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>fact, the parties agree that in Clarke\u2019s August 14, 1987, letter he offered to renew White\u2019s full-time contract beginning September 1, 1987.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> White argues that Clarke\u2019s offer was not a genuine offer but, rather, a ruse. White alleges that Clarke knew she could not obtain day care for her child on such short notice, having received the offer only eleven days before the new contract was to begin. While we acknowledge that inferences which may be drawn from uncontested facts are to be drawn in favor of the opposing party, the application of this principle \u201cis predicated on the clear averment by the opposing party of subsidiary facts in [her sworn] pleadings or affidavits.\u201d <em>Community Nat\u2019l Bank, supra </em>at 559 n.8. White offered no specific facts to demonstrate that Clarke\u2019s offer was a ploy to terminate her. Many of her statements in her affidavit were on information and belief (the motion judge characterized them as \u201copinion\u201d) and, thus, are not sufficient under rule 56. See <em>McKenzie </em>v. <em>Brigham &amp; Women\u2019s Hosp., </em>405 Mass. 432, 437-438 (1989). The only other evidence remotely on point is from the deposition testimony of the co-director of the Joiner Center, Kevin Bowen. Bowen testified that Clarke said \u201che had gotten rid of Kate [White].\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> We do not consider this a clear averment permitting the inference, without more, that the offer of employment was a ruse.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>The facts of record do not permit the conclusion that White was terminated. Thus, she failed to establish a prima facie case of sex discrimination, and summary judgment for the defendants was properly entered. White\u2019s claim of retaliation also must fail because this claim also is premised on the fact that she was terminated. As we have indicated, and as the Superior Court judge ruled, she was not terminated. White chose not to accept Clarke\u2019s offer of employment. There can be no claim of retaliatory termination when there has not been a termination.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">Finally, White\u2019s claim that Clarke intentionally interfered with her advantageous relations with the University also is premised on her claim that she was terminated. There having been no termination, White cannot establish a prima facie case.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b570-8\">General Laws c. 151B, \u00a7 4 (1988 ed.), provided, in part: \u201cIt shall be unlawful practice:</p>\n<p id=\"b570-9\">\u201c1.
