L. c. 152 (1990 ed.) for a subsequent injury. We hold that he may not receive compensation if the employer substantially relied on the knowing misrepresentation in hiring the employee and if there is a causal connection between the misrepresentation and the injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-5\">After a bench trial, the Superior Court judge found the following facts. On March 31, 1988, Anthony Delgiacco, the defendant, applied for a position as a warehouseman with Shaw\u2019s Supermarkets, Inc. (Shaw\u2019s). Shaw\u2019s informed him that the job required a strong, healthy back and involved repetitive heavy lifting of from five to 100 pounds during an eight-hour shift. Delgiacco underwent a physical examination and completed a medical history questionnaire in connection with the application. Question three in the questionnaire asked, \u201cAre you troubled by pains in the back or shoulder?\u201d Question four asked, \u201cHave you ever had a back problem?\u201d Delgiacco answered \u201cno\u201d to both questions. The examining physician relied on those answers and certified to Shaw\u2019s that Delgiacco was physically able to perform the job of warehouseman.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-6\">Shaw\u2019s hired Delgiacco for the job. The judge found that, in so doing, Shaw\u2019s relied on Delgiacco\u2019s answers in the questionnaire. In fact, Delgiacco had filed six claims against prior employers for work-related back injuries occurring between May 5, 1982, and February 7, 1986. On July 13, 1987, another doctor had opined that Delgiacco \u201chas a permanent disability in his back ... he will never be able to perform heavy work again.\u201d The six claims were resolved by lump sum settlement on April 14, 1988. Delgiacco never informed Shaw\u2019s or Shaw\u2019s examining physician about this history. The judge found that Delgiacco knew that the answers he gave in the questionnaire were false and was aware that, if Shaw\u2019s knew about the prior injuries, it would not have hired him.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-7\">On Delgiacco\u2019s fifth day of work, he fell over a pallet and injured his back. He did not report the injury until six days later. He collected workers\u2019 compensation benefits from Lib<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"842\">*842</page-number>erty Mutual Insurance Company (Liberty Mutual), Shaw\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation carrier, in the amount of $11,115. In August, 1988, Shaw\u2019s and Liberty Mutual discovered the prior injuries for which Delgiacco had received compensation. Shaw\u2019s terminated his employment and Liberty Mutual terminated his benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-5\">Shaw\u2019s and Liberty Mutual filed a complaint in the Superior Court pursuant to G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 14, seeking declarations that Delgiacco fraudulently misrepresented his physical condition to Shaw\u2019s, that the termination of employment was warranted, that the termination of his compensation payments, was warranted, and that Shaw\u2019s and Liberty Mutual are entitled to receive reimbursement for fraudulent compensation claims, costs of the proceedings, attorneys\u2019 fees, and a penalty in an amount not less than three times the average weekly wage in the Commonwealth. See G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-6\">The judge ruled that Delgiacco procured his position with Shaw\u2019s by fraud, that his contract of employment therefore was void ab initio, and that the benefits were obtained fraudulently. The judge ordered Delgiacco to reimburse $11,115, the amount of benefits received, to Liberty Mutual, with interest and costs. The judge also awarded the plaintiffs attorneys\u2019 fees. Delgiacco appealed to the Appeals Court and we transferred the case to this court on our own motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-7\">A contract induced by fraudulent misrepresentations is voidable, not void. See <em>Berenson </em>v. <em>French, </em>262 Mass. 247, 260-261 (1928); <em>Joseph Martinelli &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Simon Siegel Co., </em>176 F.2d 98, 100 (1st Cir. 1949); Restatement (Second) of Contracts \u00a7 164 (1981). The rule applies in the employment context as well. See <em>Still </em>v. <em>Norfolk &amp; W. Ry., </em>368 U.S. 35, 45 (1961); <em>Long </em>v. <em>Big Horn Constr. Co., </em>75 Wyo. 276, 282 (1956); 1C A. Larson, Workmen\u2019s Compensation \u00a7 47.53 (1986). Cf. <em>Garnhum\u2019s Case, </em>348 Mass. 87, 88-90 (1964) (rejecting contention that compensation must be denied because employee\u2019s status as minor rendered employment contract void). Delgiacco was Shaw\u2019s employee at the time of the injury, although his misrepresentation would have justified a rescission of the employment contract. See <em>Cherry </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"843\">*843</page-number>v. <em>Crispin, </em>346 Mass. 89, 92 (1963). Generally, this issue is not analyzed on the ground that the contract was void ab initio. See note 2, <em>infra. </em>We thus consider whether, despite that misrepresentation, Delgiacco is entitled to receive benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-4\">In his treatise on workers\u2019 compensation law, Professor Larson notes the emergence of a three-part \u201ccommon-sense rule\u201d governing claims by employees who obtained employment by misrepresentation. In order for such a misrepresentation to bar benefits, the following factors must be found: \u201c(1) The employee must have knowingly and wilfully made a false representation as to his physical condition. (2) The employer must have relied upon the false representation and this reliance must have been a substantial factor in the hiring. (3) There must have been a causal connection between the false representation and the injury.\u201d 1C A. Larson, Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law \u00a7 47.53 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b859-5\">A large number of jurisdictions have adopted the so-called \u201cLarson rule,\u201d or some form of it.* <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Those courts which have rejected the rule<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> usually do so because they can find no pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"844\">*844</page-number>vision in their workers\u2019 compensation laws which authorizes the denial of compensation based on misrepresentation in securing employment. We therefore turn to G. L. c. 152 to determine whether the Legislature intended to provide compensation to workers who obtain employment through fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-5\">General Laws c. 152, \u00a7 27 (1990 ed.), provides: \u201cIf the employee is injured by reason of his serious and- wilful misconduct, he shall not receive compensation . . . .\u201d In our view, this provision extends to the kind of misconduct encompassed by the Larson rule. The first prong of the Larson test \u2014 that the employee must have knowingly and wilfully made a false representation about his or her physical condition \u2014 ensures that the misrepresentation meets \u00a7 27\u2019s \u201cserious and wilful misconduct\u201d standard. The second and third prongs \u2014 that the employer substantially relied on the misrepresentation in hiring the employee and that there be a causal connection between the misrepresentation and the injury \u2014 serve to determine whether the injury is \u201cby reason of\u2019 the misconduct. Therefore, when the three Larson criteria are met, the employee\u2019s misrepresentation amounts to serious and wilful misconduct causing injury, and the Legislature has precluded compensation under \u00a7 27.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-6\">Moreover, the strong antifraud policy evident elsewhere in c. 152 further convinces us that the Legislature did not intend to provide compensation in the face of such a misrepresentation. Section 14 (1) assesses the entire cost of workers\u2019 compensation proceedings on a party who brings, prosecutes, or defends a claim without reasonable cause. When the claim is brought, prosecuted, or defended with the intent to defraud, \u00a7 14 (2) assesses the party with costs, attorneys\u2019 fees, and a penalty of not less than three times the average weekly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"845\">*845</page-number>wage in the Commonwealth. Given this clear indication that the compensation procedure is not to be abused, we believe that the Legislature intended to preclude workers\u2019 compensation in cases in which an employee\u2019s deliberate misrepresentation leads to injury. Therefore, we conclude that, with respect to fraud in the procurement of employment, the Larson rule\u2019s three-part test determines when \u00a7 27 bars compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-5\">The judge made specific findings with regard to the first two parts of the test. The judge found that Delgiacco intentionally misrepresented his health condition to Shaw\u2019s, and that Shaw\u2019s relied on the misrepresentation as a substantial and material factor in the hiring. The judge did not, however, determine whether there was a causal connection between the misrepresentation and the injury. The plaintiffs have the burden of proving each of the three prongs of the Larson test. See <em>Sanchez </em>v. <em>Memorial Gen. Hosp., </em>110 N.M. 683, 686 (Ct. App.), cert, denied, 110 N.M. 653 (1990); <em>Emerson Elec. Co. </em>v. <em>McLarty, </em>487 So. 2d 228, 230 (Miss. 1986); <em>Ledbetter </em>v. <em>Pine Knoll Nursing Home, </em>180 Ga. App. 654, 655 (1986).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Therefore, despite the expert medical testimony in evidence that the causal connection between the misrepresentation and the injury existed, we must remand the case for a determination of this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-6\">If the judge concludes that the third prong of the test (causal relationship) is satisfied, then the question of damages arises. The judge ordered Delgiacco to reimburse Liberty Mutual the amount of the award, plus interest and costs. The judge also awarded attorneys\u2019 fees to the plaintiffs. The judge did not refer to the penalty authorized under \u00a7 14 (2). Under \u00a7 27, if the judge finds that Delgiacco\u2019s misrepresentation was causally connected to his injury, Liberty Mutual is entitled to reimbursement of the compensation paid plus interest. As for costs, they are authorized under \u00a7 14 (1) only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"846\">*846</page-number>if proceedings are brought or defended without reasonable ground. Given that neither we nor the Appeals Court had ruled, prior to this case, on whether misrepresentation in the procurement of employment bars compensation, and given the substantial number of jurisdictions holding that compensation is required even when the injury and misrepresentation are causally connected, see note 3, <em>supra, </em>it cannot fairly be said that this claim was defended without reasonable cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-5\">Section 14 (2) requires the imposition of costs, attorneys\u2019 fees, and a penalty on a party who brings, prosecutes, or defends workers\u2019 compensation proceedings \u201cwith the intent to defraud.\u201d The judge found that Delgiacco intended to defraud Shaw\u2019s in obtaining employment. Because the evidence offered did not support an intent to defraud in seeking benefits, the costs and attorneys\u2019 fees awarded cannot stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-6\">The judgment is reversed, the award of costs and attorneys\u2019 fees vacated, and the case is remanded for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b862-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b859-6\">see <em>Shippers Transp. of Ga. </em>v. <em>Stepp, </em>265 Ark. 365 (1979); <em>Air Mod Corp. </em>v. <em>Newton, </em>59 Del. 148 (1965); <em>Martin Co. </em>v. <em>Carpenter, </em>132 So. 2d 400 (Fla. 1961); <em>Ledbetter </em>v. <em>Pine Knoll Nursing Home, </em>180 Ga.
