At the trial before the recorder of <em>Albany, </em>in <em>September, </em>1816, the plaintiffs below proved that, in the spring of 1815, they shipped, with a number of other articles, on board the sloop <em>George, </em>of which the defendant below was master, two chests of tea, - to he carried to <em>Albany, </em>and delivered to <em>Mounsey </em>and <em>Olmstead </em>of that city; and it was testified by <em>Hyde, </em>a clerk of <em>Mounsey </em>and <em>Olmstead, </em>that the <em>George </em>arrived in <em>Albany </em>about the 22d of <em>May, </em>and that all the goods were received, except one chest of tea.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b47-13\"><em>Robert Brozan, </em>a witness for the defendant below, testifie<em>d, </em>that soon after the sloop arrived at <em>Albany, </em>one of the firm of <em>Mounsey </em>and <em>Ohnstead </em>came on board and put his name <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>opposite to the entry of the plaintiff\u2019s goods on the sloop\u2019s, fre\u00a1g]^ ]jgt. jj. was sworn by <em>Hyde, </em>that the name on the freightlistwas not the hand writing of either of the consignees. <em>Brown </em>further stated, that the goods of the plaintiffs were put on the dock together, and were taken away by one <em>Carle, </em>a cartman, who was the general cartman of <em>Mounsey </em>arid <em>Olmstead, </em>for carrying goods from the different sloops to their store.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b48-5\">The defendant offered to prove that it was customary in the city of <em>Albany </em>for the captains of vessels freighted with goods for merchants in that place, to deliver them by putting them upon the dock, and giving notice to the consignees, who usually had cartmen to convey them to their stores, and that such delivery, with notice, was, by custom, considered a good delivery'. The counsel for the plaintiffs objected to this testimony, and it was overruled. The plaintiffs then offered <em>Carle, </em>the cartman, as a witness, who was objected to on account of interest, but was admitted by the court. <em>Carle </em>testified that he had often carried goods from the sloops for <em>Mounsey </em>and <em>Olmstead j </em>that, at the time when the chest of tea was lost, after the sloop had arrived at the dock, he saw one Jsfee/er/who told him that there were some goods on board for <em>Mounsey </em>and <em>Olmstead, </em>and that he must go and take them away; that he carried one load one day, and another load the next, and believed that he carried all the goods of <em>Mounsey </em>and <em>Olmstead </em>that were shown him, to their store, who paid him for the cartage. He further testified that a part of the goods had, by mistake,'been put into a waggon,'from whence he took them. The jury found a verdict for the plaintiffs below, the defendants in error, the recorder having charged that <em>Carle, </em>under all the circumstances, was not such an agent- of <em>Mounsey </em>and <em>Olmstead, </em>as to render a delivery to him a legal delivery.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b48-6\">A bill of exceptions was taken on the part of the defendant below, which was removed into this court by writ of error.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b48-7\"><em>Foot, </em>for the plaintiff in error, contended,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A5B\">(1.) That the proof offered of the usage, ought not to have been rejected. In <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Wright </em>(1 Caines\u2019 <em>Rep. </em>43.) evidence of usage <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>was admitted <em>\u00a1 </em>and the court say, that \u201c the true test of a commercial usage is its having existed a sufficient length of time, to have become generally known, and to warrant the presumption that contracts are made in reference to it.\u201d <em>(Rushforth </em>v. Hadfield, 7 <em>East, </em>224.) In <em>Wardell </em>v. <em>Mourillyar, </em>(2 Esp. <em>N. P. Rep. </em>693.) which was an action against a hoyman for not delivering goods, Lord <em>Kenyon </em>left it to the jury to decide what was the custom, as to landing the goods at a particular wharf. And many cases are to be. found- in the <em>English </em>books, of evidence of usage or custom being received. <em>(Syeds </em>v. <em>Hay, </em>4 <em>Term Rep. </em>260. <em>Hyde </em>v. <em>Trent. Navig. Co. 5 Term Rep. </em>389. 397. <em>Catley </em>v. <em>Wintringham, Peake\u2019s N. P. Cases, </em>150. <em>Abbot on Ships, </em>247.) The time when the liability of the carrier is to cease, depends on the custom of the particular place. (2 <em>Comyn on Contracts, </em>329, 330.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b49-6\">2. A delivery to an agent, or servant, is a delivery to the principal. The cartman, in this case, being in the usual employment of the plaintiff, must be deemed, <em>pro hac vice, </em>his agent.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b49-7\">3. A delivery on the wharf, or at the dock, is, by law, a good delivery. This seems to be admitted in the case of a common carrier from port to port. (3 <em>Wils. </em>429. 2 <em>Wm. Bl. </em>916. 5 <em>Term Rep. </em>389. 4 <em>Term Rep. </em>581.)</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b49-10\"><em>Hale, </em>contra.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AFd\">This is an action against a common carrier, who is held to very strict responsibility. Nothing but the act of God, or a public enemy, will excuse him for a nondelivery of the goods entrusted to his care. The delivery must be either to the party himself, or to some person authorized by him to receive the goods. Putting the goods, especially where they are perishable articles, on a wharf or dock, cannot be a good delivery. In the case of <em>Wardell </em>v. <em>Mourillyar, </em>the delivery was made to a <em>wharfinger, </em>not merely by putting them on a wharf. In <em>England, </em>a wharfinger is an officer or agent well known in the law, and who is responsible for the safe keeping of the goods delivered to him. (4 <em>Term Rep. </em>260. 7 <em>Term Rep. </em>171. 5 <em>Burr. </em>2825.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AH3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>No notice was given to the consignee, in this case, of the delivery of the goods at the wharf.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"AFq\">Platt, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AN0\">delivered the opinion of the court. In a case where the <em>precise place of delivery </em>is material, it may he proper to allow evidence of a <em>local usage. </em>For instance, the usage at <em>Havanna </em>is often proved to show that some species of cargoes, such as slaves, are to he delivered at the <em>Moro Castle, </em>and that other articles are deliverable only on the wharfs in the inner harbour. But in this case, it seems to me, that the only question is, not whether the tea was delivered at the <em>right place, </em>but whether it was delivered <em>at all, </em>to <em>Mounsey </em>and <em>Olmstead ?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b50-7\">If it be true, that one of the consignees Avent on board the vessel and saw a list of the goods, (which I think is not proved,) <em>that </em>would not be evidence of a delivery. The goods xvere then in the hold of the vessel. The master, soon afterwards, put them on the dock, but not in the presence, nor with the knoAvledge of either of the consignees. , No notice was given to <em>Mounsey </em>and <em>Olmstead </em>that the-goods were unladen, or that they had arrived. But a cartman Avho \u201c had often carted for them and Avho, no doubt, had often carted for fifty other persons, came, by the direction of Mr. <em>Keeler, </em>(a stranger to the plaintiffs beloAV,) and on that day carried one load to the store of the consignees; the residue was left all night on the wharf, and the next day, the same cartman found some of them in a strange Avaggon, and the box of tea has not since been heard \u00f3f. In truth, the only acts done by <em>Mounsey </em>and <em>Olmstead </em>or their clerk, were to receive in store such articles as the cartman brought to them, and to pay him for carting them; and there is no proof that they ever had any other knowledge of the goods. The weight of evidence clearly shows that neither of them were on board the sloop.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-8\">Admitting, then, that the wharf was the place of delivery, a mere <em>landing </em>the goods on the wharf was <em>no </em>delivery. A delivery, in this case, implies mutual acts of the <em>carrier </em>and the <em>consignees.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b50-9\">A <em>tender, </em>merely, of the goods to the consignees, without their acceptance, would not be a performance of the car<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>rier\u2019s duty in such a case. Suppose the consignees had been dead, or absent, or had refused to receive the goods in store, what would have been the carrier\u2019s duty ? Certainly he would have no right to leave them on the wharf, or in the street, without protection. He would not be justified in abandoning the goods. He had notice that <em>Stafford </em>and <em>Brown </em>were the owners ; and if <em>Mounsey </em>and <em>Olmstead </em>would not take charge of the goods as consignees, he ought to have secured them on board his vessel, or in some other place of safety; and that would have entitled him to his freight with all extra charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-14\">The fiecision of the court below on the question of local usage, was on a point which is immaterial in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-15\">The second exception was, I think, properly abandoned on the argument; and the opinion of the court below on the last point, to wit, that the cartman was not to be regarded as the general agent of the consignees, for receiving \u2022 goods, merely on the ground of his being often employed by them to cart goods, was undoubtedly correct. Because a merchant usually selects a cartman, and employs him exclusively in carrying goods, according to his orders, it by no means follows that such cartman is his general agent for receiving goods, without orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-16\">The defendants in error are, therefore, entitled to judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-17\">Judgment accordingly.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
