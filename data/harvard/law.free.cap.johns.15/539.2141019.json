A deed from , <em>Simeon Lawson, </em>dated 14th <em>November, </em>1791 ; and a deed of the same date from <em>Thomas W.

Another witness testified, that <em>Peter </em>bought the land of his father in the spring, and died about seed-time, the same year, in possession, and that his family continued in possession a year or two after his death. The deposition of <em>Simeon </em>Lawson, one of the sons of <em>W.

Lawson, </em>and <em>John Brower, </em>were defendants, and which cause was tried on the 14th of <em>June, 1797, </em>before <em>Morgan Lewis, </em>Esq. then one of the Justices of this court, and judgment was signed the 4th of <em>August, </em>1797. The defendant then offered to prove that the lessor of the plaintiff was present at the trial in that suit; that he was the agent of <em>E. Lawson, </em>in preparing the defence, conducting the trial, and examining and cross-examining the witnesses ; and that <em>Peter Dubois, </em>who is since dead, was sworn as a witness at that trial, on the part of the then plaintiff, and testified, in the hearing and presence of the lessor in this suit, that he surveyed the premises in question on the 14th of <em>February, </em>1769, at the request of,P. <em>Lawson, </em>and his father <em>William, </em>and drew a deed in fee simple from <em>William </em>to <em>Peter, </em>and a bond from <em>Peter to William </em>for the purchase money, and that <em>William </em>told the witness, some months afterwards, that he had conveyed the premises to his son, and was afraid that he would not be able to pay the residue of the consideration money. This testimony was objected to, and excluded by the Judge. The jury found a verdict for the plaintiff, which the defendant now moved to set aside, and for a new trial, on the grounds, 1. That the verdict was contrary to evidence; and 2. That the judge had rejected proper testimony.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"A2K\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>Oakley, for the defendant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ApOx\">contended, that the defendant, having shown a prior possession in his father, it was evidence of right, and ought to prevail against a subsequent possession of <em>W.

Besides, there was sufficient evidence of a conveyance from <em>W. L. </em>the elder, to <em>P. L. </em>the father of the defendant. If there could be any doubt on this point, that doubt would have been removed by the evidence offered of whatZ)Mbois,a witness, since deceased, swore on a former trial of the action of ejectment against the widow of <em>W. L. </em>and J. <em>B. </em>The lessor of the plaintiff was present at that trial, and examined the witnesses. The admission of this species of evidence is a departure from the strict technical rules of law, and allowed from necessity. <em>(Jackson </em>v. Bailey, 2 <em>Johns. Rep. </em>17. 20. <em>Taylor v. Brown, T. Raym. </em>170.) In <em>Calhoun\u2019s Lessee </em>v. <em>Dunning, </em>(4 <em>Dallas, </em>120.) it was objected that a record of an action of trespass, brought by the defendant against one <em>Caruthers, </em>could not be read in evidence, as it was not between the same parties ; but the objection was overruled, on the ground that <em>Caruthers </em>was the person really interested as the owner of the land ; and that Calhoun, the lessor, was \u00e1 mere trustee for him.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b550-5\">A verdict for or against a lessee, is evidence for or against him in reversion; and a verdict for him in remainder, is evidence against a subsequent remainder man ; for he claims by the same deed. <em>(Pyke </em>v. <em>Crouch, </em>1 <em>Ld.

To admit the paroi declarations of <em>W. L., </em>made 25 years ago, would be most dangerous, unless some account was given of the deed. <em>(\u00ab7ackson </em>v. <em>Shearman, </em>6 <em>Johns.

Schuyler, v. Vedder, </em>6 <em>Johns. Rep. </em>8. 14.) The only exception to this rule is the case of a remainder man.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b551-4\">Van Ness, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AM6X\">delivered the opinion of the court. The first question I shall consider, is, whether the testimony given by <em>Dubois, </em>in the action of ejectment brought by the present defendant against the widow of <em>William Lawson </em>and <em>Brower, </em>and in which the then plaintiff had judgment in 1797, was properly rejected or not. By the will of <em>William Lawson, </em>he devised all his estate to his wife during her widowhood, with remainder to certain of his children and grand children, part of whose estate the now lessor of the plaintiff purchased in 1791. Both the widow of <em>William </em>Lawson, and the lessor of the plaintiff, thus claim under the same will; and I am inclined to think, that there is such a privity of estate between them, that the verdict in that case was, for certain purposes, evidence (though not conclusive) in this. It was evidence, at least, to lay the foundation for admitting the testimony given by <em>Dubois, </em>more especially as the lessor of the plaintiff, in point of fact, had notice of, and defended the former ejectment; was present at the trial, and had an opportunity of cross-examining the witnesses, though I lay no particular stress on these latter facts. The estate devised to the widow during her widowhood, and the remainder over, constitute but one estate carved out of the same inheritance, created and subsisting together, the one in possession, the other in expectancy. An estate in remainder is a present interest, though to be enjoyed in future, and is capable of being aliened, devised, and otherwise disposed of, in the same manner as an estate in possession.' The possession of the widow was, for certain purposes, the possession of the remainder men, and the entry of the present defendant under the recovery in the ejectment, was a prejudice to those in remainder, for, in consequence of it, the estate in remainder has become a right in action only. The lessor of the plaintiff had an interest in defeating the recovery, and his right was so interwoven with that of the widow, that the evidence of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number><em>Dubois </em>affected the one almost equally with the other. My a\u00a3\u00bfenf\u00a1on was not called to this view of the subject at the trial; and the fact, that the present lessor of the plaintiff had purchased part of the estate in remainder before the trial in 1797, was overlooked; and the counsel for the defendant put the admissibility of the testimony offered, on the ground that the lessor of the plaintiff was the agent of the widow, and present at the trial. It was held hy Ch. J. <em>Holt, </em>\u201c that if several estates in remainder be limited in a deed, and one of the.remainder men obtains a verdict for him, in an action brought against him for the same land, that verdict may be given in evidence for the subsequent, remainder man in an action brought against him for the same land, though he does not claim any estate under the first remainder man, because <em>they all claim under the same deed.'1'1 Pike </em>v. <em>Crouch, (1 Lord Raym. </em>730.)</p>\n<p id=\"b552-6\">If the verdict in the former ejectment was admissible on the trial of this suit, by reason that the tenant for life and the remainder men are privies in estate, it follows, that the evidence given in the first suit by a deceased witness, is also admissible. The rule is, that such evidence is proper, not only when the point in issue is the same in a subsequent suit between the same parties, but also for or against persons standing in the relation of privies in blood, privies in estate, or privies in law. On this ground, the defendant is entitled to a new trial; though independently of this, I think a new trial ought to be granted on the other ground taken in the argument, that the verdict is against the weight of evidence. The proof of a conveyance by <em>William Lawson, </em>in his lifetime, to his son <em>Peter, </em>is very clear and satisfactory.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-7\">New trial granted, with costs to abide the event*</p>\n<p id=\"b552-8\">END 0F OCTOBER TERM\u00bf.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
