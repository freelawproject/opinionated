The writs of <em>ca. sa, </em>mentioned in the condie 7 tian of the bond, and the departure of <em>Lawrence </em>from the , limits, were admitted on the part of the defendant below,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A8c\">The counsel for the defendant then offered in evidence, under the notice annexed to his plea, in bar of the action, that previous to the execution of the bond, <em>Lawrence </em>had been twice arrested by <em>Van Duzer, </em>one of the deputies of plaintiff below, by virtue of the two executions before mentioned; that previous to the third arrest and imprisonment of <em>Lawrence, </em>on the day ol the date ol the bond, he had been twice voluntarily discharged, and permitted to escape, by <em>Van Duzer, </em>who had received a compensation for such discharge and permission. The court ruled that the evidence was insufficient to bar the action, and the jury thereupon found a verdict for the plaintiff below. The defend- * . ant tendered a hill of exceptions to the opinion of the court below, which was removed into this court by writ of error.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"A-j\"><em>W. A. Duer, </em>for the plaintiff in error, contended,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AzgD\">that the arrest and discharge from imprisonment amounted to a satisfaction of the debt. \u00c1 voluntary discharge by the sheriff was, as it respects him, a payment; and his power to arrest was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>was at an end. He could not maintain an action against the prisoner, to recover the money. Although a discharge of the defendant, without the authority or consent of the plaintiff, may not bind him, yet even the plaintiff would be obliged to sue out a new'writ, on the ground that the former <em>ca. sa. </em>was a nullity, or had not been returned. It is against all legal reason, that one writ can be twice operative, and produce the same effect. By the first arrest, the writ has been obeyed, and has performed its proper function; and after a voluntary discharge, the sheriff cannot arrest a second time. If he does so, he is liable to an action for false imprisonment. The authorities are explicit and conclusive. <em>(Lansing </em>v. <em>Fleet, </em>2 <em>Johns.

The bond is void. The sheriff cannot, <em>colore officii, </em>take a bond for security for a debt, for which he has already received satisfaction. He cannot in this suit obtain, indirectly, what the law would not allow him to recover directly from the prisoner. As the sheriff roust, as preliminary proof to his action, produce the writ under which he acted, the defendant below may show, by way of defence, that the debt was satisfied, and the sheriff fraudulently exacted the bond.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b265-8\"><em>Betts, </em>contra.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"APo\">The sheriff had the assent of the defendant in the execution to the arrest. He was a party to the bond given for the liberties, and having executed it, with a knowledge of his rights, he must be bound by it. <em>(Ackly </em>v. <em>Hoskins, </em>14 <em>Johns. Rep. </em>374. 376.) The bond is taken for</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b266-6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>, Spencer, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Agd\">delivered the opinion of the court. This is a writ of error to the common pleas of <em>Orange </em>county. The defendant here, who was plaintiff below, sued on a joint and several bond, entered into by the plaintiff in error and <em>William </em>Lawrence, to the defendant, as sheriff of the county of <em>Orange, </em>conditioned that <em>Lawrence </em>would remain a true and faithful prisoner on two writs of <em>ca. sa. </em>issued out of the common pleas of <em>Orange, </em>and not escape or go without the limits of the gaol liberties of that county.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-7\">We are to intend from the hill of exceptions that the plaintiff below proved every thing necessary to entitle him to recover; the bill of exceptions having been tendered to the opinion of the court in overruling the defence set up at the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-8\">Under a notice to the plea, it was offered to be proved, that <em>Lawrence </em>had been twice arrested by a deputy of the sheriff, on the same executions, and had been twice voluntarily discharged and permitted to escape by such deputy, t\u00ae whom compensation had been made for such permissions to escape before the arrest on the same process, and under which the bond was given ; this evidence being objected to was\" overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-9\">The principle now insisted on is, that it w'as not competent to the sheriff to re-imprison <em>Lawrence, </em>after his deputy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>had permitted him to escape; and that the bond exacted from <em>Lawrence </em>on the third arrest, after his voluntary escape, was taken illegally, and is void.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-6\">The case does not show any act of the plaintiff in the ex-eculions affirming the arrest of <em>Lawrence </em>under them 5 it cannot then be distinguished from the case of <em>Lansing </em>v. <em>Fleet, </em>(2 <em>Johns. Cas. </em>2.) That ca$e was well considered and very ably discussed, and it settles the point, that after a voluntary escape, the sheriff cannot lawfully retake or detain a prisoner, unless the plaintiff in the execution shall issue a new process ; nor can he detain on the surrender of the prisoner himself, unless the plaintiff in the execution does some act showing his election to hold him on the old process. It is useless to review the cases cited in that case, as they are extremely well examined.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-8\">The next point is, whether if the bond is void as to <em>Laurence </em>on account of duress, <em>Thompson </em>can set up that defcnce. It is clearly settled, that where a person is illegally restrained of his liberty, and, whilst under such restraint, enters into any obligation to the person causing the restraint, it is avoidable for duress of imprisonment. (Co. <em>Litt. </em>253. Jenk. 166. 2 <em>Inst. </em>482.)</p>\n<p id=\"b267-10\">But it is answered that this bond being joint and several, and <em>Thompson </em>being a surety, he cannot avoid the bond for duress as to <em>Lawrence, </em>and the case of <em>Huscombe </em>v. Standing, <em>(Cro. Jac. </em>187.) has been referred to in support of the position. As a general principle it cannot be controverted, that if a bond be obtained from <em>A. </em>and <em>B. </em>by duress against <em>A., B. </em>cannot plead the duress against <em>A. </em>to invalidate the bond as against him. This, however, is applicable to cases depending on common law principles, and where there is no statutory provision interposed. Sheriffs can take no bond or other security, in matters relating to the execution of their offices, but only to themselves, and by the name of their office, with such conditions as the law prescribes j and any obligation taken by a sheriff in other form, by co-lour of his office, is declared void. (1 N. <em>R. L. </em>423, 424.) And the act relative to gaol liberties, (1 <em>N. R. L. </em>427.) making it the duty of sheriffs to let prisoners, on civil process, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>go at large within the limits of the liberties, on giving secu&gt;rity, is a mere modification and extension of the former act. Perhaps, as the bond here taken was in'the terms prescribed by the act, it cannot be said to be void, as being taken <em>colore officii. </em>But the taking the bond was unlawful, and the condition itself Was void. <em>Lawrence </em>could not remain h true and aithful prisoner upon executions on which the sheriff had no right or power to detain him. The bond had no more validity than if the sheriff had taken it without any execution in his hands against <em>Lawrence; </em>a condition that a man shall not plough his land, or go out of his house, being in restraint of a common right, is void. <em>(Bac. Abr. Oblig. </em>(E. 3.)) Conditions in restraint of trade have been adjudged, repeatedly, to be void ; and among other reasons, as against the public good, by depriving the party of his means of livelihood. <em>(Bacon, tit. </em>Bond. (K.))</p>\n<p id=\"b268-7\">Judgment reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
