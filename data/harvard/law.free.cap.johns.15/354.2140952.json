From the affidavits which were read, it appeared, that the suit was commenced in 1807, and after a trial and verdict for the plaintiff, judgment was entered for yie plaintiff, in <em>October </em>term, 1816, there being no order * 7 7 7 \u00b0 to stay proceedings, but no execution was issued until sometime in <em>July, </em>last past.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b362-10\">That the new evidence, which it was contended would clearly show a title to the premises out of the lessors of the plaintiff was not known or discovered by the defendant until the 27th of <em>April, </em>last past.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b362-12\"><em>Weston, </em>for the defendant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AMc\">said, that under the particular circumstances .of the case, the motion ought to be heard. In <em>Case </em>v. <em>Shepherd, </em>(1 <em>Johns. Cases, </em>245.) the court allowed the motion to be made after judgment had been perfected, on the ground of a misconstruction of the rule of practice by the defendant\u2019s attorney. In <em>Birt </em>v. <em>Barlow, (Doug. </em>170.) the court of K. B. allowed the motion to be made, after the four days had expired, under the special circumstances. <em>(Bac. Abr. Trial, L. </em>1.) <em>In Loft\u2019s Reports, (160.) </em>it is said, that it is never too late to move for a new trial on a new discovery ; which will take it out of the general rule of four days, if you apply in due time after the discovery made.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b363-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number><em>Mitchill </em>and <em>Van Vechten, </em>contra.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b363-5\">\n<em>Per Curiam.</em>\n</author>\n<p id=\"AEx\">A motion for a new trial must be within the first four days of the term, and before judgment is perfected, unless an order to stay proceedings on the verdict has been obtained, which operates as an enlargement of the rule of four days. In no case has a motion for a new trial been heard, after a judgment has been regularly perfected. The <em>case of Shepherd </em>arose soon after the pres\u00e9nt rules and orders of the court were made, and the court, under the particular circumstances of the case, of an-alleged misapprehension of the meaning of the 4th rule of <em>January </em>term, 1799', allowed the motion to be made.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-9\">Motion denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
