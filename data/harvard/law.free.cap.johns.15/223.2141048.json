At the trial, after the plaintif\u00eds below had gone through with their evidence, the counsel for the defendants applied to thecourtfor the discharge of <em>JohnG.

The counsel for the plaintiffs objected to his discharge, that both defendants had joined in pleading the general issue ; and the court, for this reason, decided that they could not discharge this defendant, although they were of opinion that there was no testimony against him, on which the jury could find him guilty. The defendants excepted to the opinion of the court, and a verdict having been found for the plaintiffs -below, the bill of exceptions was removed into this court, by writ,of error.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b231-10\"><em>Conklin, </em>for the plaintiffs in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A7I\">He cited <em>Buller's N.

It was an action of assault and battery; and upon the trial no evidence having been given against the defendant, <em>John G. Van </em>Deusen, application was made to the court for his discharge, that he might be examined as a witness for the other defendant. The court admitted that there was no testimony against him upon which he could be found guilty, but decided that they could not discharge him, because both defendants had joined in one plea. In this they erred. In actions for torts against several, although they join in the plea of not guilty, one may be found guilty and the other not guilty. The rule has been long and well settled, in such actions, that where there is no evidence against one of the defendants, he is entitled to his discharge, and may be examined as a witness for the other defendants. If this were not allowed, great injustice might be done by including witnesses in the suit, for the express purpose of shutting out their testimony. (2 <em>Esp. Dig. </em>364. <em>Phil.
