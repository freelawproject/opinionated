Fitch, </em>or bearer, on the 1st of <em>June, </em>1812. Plea, <em>non assumpsit. </em>The cause was tried at the <em>Cortlandt </em>circuit, in <em>June, </em>1817, be-Mr. Justice <em>Platt.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b363-12\">The defence, at the trial, was usury; to prove which, the defendants called <em>Jlbner Humphreys </em>as a witness, who testified, that in <em>May, </em>1811, <em>Fitch </em>applied to him for a loan of a sum of money, which he declined lending, but said, that if <em>Fitch </em>had any good notes, he would purchase them. A few days afterwards, <em>Fitch </em>brought the witness several notes, executed by the defendants, amounting in the whole to 363 dollars, including the notes on which this suit was brought, which the witness purchased, at a discount of twenty-one per cent, or for 300 dollars. The witness said, that at the time of the purchase, he did not know but that the notes were given by the defendants to <em>Fitch </em>in the ordb <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>nary way of business; and that it was not previously agreed or any other notes \u00f3f the defendants, should be procured for that purpose; that the witness merely agreed t\u00b0 purchase notes to about that amount, at a discount of twenty-one per cent.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b364-4\">The defendants then offered <em>D. Edwards </em>as a witness, ' to prove that <em>Filth </em>applied to the defendants for a loan of their notes to him, for 363 dollars, and informed them that he had agreed with <em>H. </em>to sell the notes to him for 300 dollars ; and that the notes were \u00e1ccordingly executed by the defendants for that purpose. This evidence was objected to on the ground, that as between the original parties there was no usurious contract, and that the facts offered to he proved were not sufficient to make the notes void for usury, unless <em>it </em>was shown, either that it had been previously agreed between <em>H. </em>and <em>F. </em>that the notes in question should be obtained for that purpose, or that <em>H. </em>knew at th\u00e9 time that the notes were not given to <em>F. </em>in the course of business, but were executed merely for his accommodation, for the purpose of selling them to <em>H. </em>at a discount.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b364-6\">The judge overruled the objection, and the witness testified, that <em>Fitch </em>applied to th\u00e9 defendants for their notes, and told them that he had agreed with <em>H. </em>for 300 dollars, at twenty-one per cent, discount; that there must be fourteen notes of twenty-five dollars each, and one note of thirteen dollars, making together 363 dollars; that the defendants agreed to make the notes for that purpose, and they accordingly executed them. The defendants offered to prove the confessions of <em>H. </em>in regard to the transaction, While the notes were in his hands. The evidence was objected to, but the judge d\u00e9cided that it was admissible. <em>Barna Smith, </em>the witness, testified, that in 1812, he applied to <em>H. </em>for a loan of money, and <em>H, </em>said he could not lend the money, unless he could obtain payment from the defendants of money he had lent them, which the witness understood from <em>H. </em>to be 300 dollars, for which he had taken their notes for 365 dollars.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b364-7\">The judge charged the jury, that if they believed the testimony of <em>Edwards, </em>and that the notes in question were made by the defendants to <em>Fitch, </em>to enable him to raise the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>sum of 300 dollars from <em>H. </em>at an interest of twenty-one per cent., and that <em>F. </em>so obtained the money, the contract was usurious, and the notes void, under the statute; that it was \u2018 immaterial whether <em>H. </em>knew the manner in which <em>F. </em>obtained the notes; he took them at his peril,, and though he may have supposed them to have been given in the ordinary course of business, they were, nevertheless, void.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b365-4\">The plaintiff having been nonsuited, a motion was now made to set the nonsuit aside.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b365-5\"><em>Collyer, </em>for the plaintiff, contended,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ar3\">1. that the evidence of <em>B.
