The parties agreed upon a case, containing the following facts, for the opinion of the court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b351-8\"><em>Peter Elszoorth, </em>an officer in the <em>Nczo-York </em>line during the revolutionary war, and as such, entitled to bounty land, made and published his last will and testament, dated <em>May </em>2d, 1781, by which he devised all his real and personal estate, whatsoever, or wheresoever, to his father <em>William </em>\u2019 \u2019 <em>Elszoorth, </em>whom he authorized and directed to sell his real . . estate, and appointed him his sole executor. P. <em>Elszoorth </em>died in the same year, without lawful issue, leaving his father <em>W. Elszoorth, </em>and a brother <em>Theophilus Elszoorth. </em>Letters patent bearing date the 7th of <em>July, </em>1790, were afterwards issued to <em>Peter Elszoorth, </em>for a military lot, which by deed bearing date the 11th of <em>October, </em>1794, <em>W. Elsworth </em>conveyed to <em>Christopher </em>Tappen, in fee, who by deed of the 3d of <em>October, </em>1794, conveyed the same to <em>Cornelius C. Roosevelt. Roosevelt </em>died on the 10th of <em>February, </em>1814, having devised the lot to <em>Eliza Evertson </em>and <em>Sarah Rooseveil, </em>two of the plaintiff\u2019s lessors, his heirs at law. <em>WilHam Elszoorth, </em>the father of the patentee, died in <em>October, </em>1799, and after his death, in 1811, <em>Theophilus Elszoorth, </em>the brother, entered into possession of the lot, his being the - , , , \u00b0 nrst actual possession, and died in possession, except of 200 acres, the premises in question, having in <em>May, </em>1806, conveyed them to <em>Yeomans, </em>who in 1814 conveyed the same to <em>Comb, </em>who by deed bearing date the 28th of <em>August, </em>1815, conveyed the same to the defendant. The defendant entered into possession, and continued in possession until after the bringing of this suit. \"</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b351-23\"><em>Griffin, </em>for the plaintiff, contended,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ad6q\">that the lands claimed, upon the death of <em>Peter Elsworth, </em>vested in his father, either <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>as devisee, or heir at law: He cited <em>Powell on </em>Devises, 236. 1 <em>N. R. L. 313. </em>sess. 36. ch. 80. s. <em>7. </em>sess. 26. ch. 83. s. 8. <em>Webster's Ed. </em>vol. 3. 399. <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Phelps, </em>3 Caines, 62. <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Winslow, </em>2 <em>Johns. Rep. </em>80.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b352-7\"><em>Sudam, </em>contra, insisted,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A1-\">that the lots in question did not pass by the will of <em>P. E. </em>in 1781, as his right to the land rested on the resolutions only of the legislature. The act of 1790 refers only to cases of soldiers dying since 1783; and the act of 1783 gives the <em>seisin </em>at the time of the death. But to render the will valid, there must have been a seisin at the time of the devise.</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b352-8\">Again; the act of 1790 does not affect this case, because <em>P. E. </em>died before 1783, and the act of 1803 does not affect the title of his brother <em>Theophilus, </em>because his father died' in 1799.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b352-9\"><em>T. E. </em>took the land on the death of <em>P. E. </em>as heir to his deceased brother. There were no intermediate heirs, and the act of 1803 has no effect on the case, as the father died in 1799. <em>T. E. </em>has always been the heir at law of the deceased soldier. Why then refer the seisin back in order to change the descent ? This case is different from any that has yet been presented to this court, relative to the rights of deceased soldiers. The case of <em>Jackson, ex dem. Austin and others, </em>v. <em>Howe, </em>(14 <em>Johns. Rep. </em>405.) is the only one that has any bearing bn the present case. All the other cases are very distinguishable from it. The court will always favour the heir at law, and there was no period of time from the death of the soldier, that his brother <em>T. E. </em>was not his heir.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b352-10\">Spencer, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AE\">delivered the opinion of the court. It is scarcely necessary after so many decisions upon the points arising in this case, to do more than briefly state the facts, and refer to the cases decided.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-11\"><em>Peter Elsworth, </em>the patentee of the lot, of which the premises in question are a part, was an officer in the revolutionary war, in the line of this state, and as such entitled to a grant of bounty lands ; the patent to him was a fulfilment, on the part of the state, of the engagement to give the lands. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>He died in <em>May, </em>1781, and by his will duly executed, he devised to his father, <em>William Elsworth, </em>all his real and personal estate whatsoever, and wheresoever, and constituted his father executor. The will authorized the executor to sell and convey the real estate. The plaintiff\u2019s title is derived under a sale by the executor, and no objection is made to the plaintiff\u2019s title, if <em>William Elsworth </em>became seised of the lot, either under the will, or as heir to the patentee.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-4\"><em>Peter Elsworth </em>died without issue, leaving his father and a brother <em>Theophilus ; </em>the defendant has deduced a regular title under him, if he was seised as heir of the patentee.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">In the case of <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Howe, </em>(14 <em>Johns. Rep. </em>406.) <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Phelps, </em>(3 <em>Caines, </em>62.) and <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Winslow, </em>(2 <em>Johns. Rep. </em>80.) this court decided, that by the act of the 5th of <em>April, </em>1803, the titles to the military bounty lots were vested in the officers and soldiers, at the time of their respective deaths, without reference to the period of issuing the letters patent.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-6\">It follows, then, that <em>Peter Elsworth </em>was seised of the lot when he died, and might devise it. But the act regulating descents, adopted by the act of the 5th of <em>April, </em>1803, in reference to their lands, would also vest the lot in <em>William Elsworth, </em>as heir to his son, the patentee, for the lot was not held by <em>bona fide </em>purchasers or devisees under Theophilus, on the 5th of <em>April, </em>1803.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-7\">The lessors of the plaintiff, <em>Eliza Evertson </em>and <em>Sarah Roosevelt, </em>are the devisees, and also the heirs at law of <em>Cornelius C. Roosevelt. </em>The adverse possession at the time of his devising, though it invalidates the devise, does not prevent the descent.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-12\">Judgment for the plaintiff.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
