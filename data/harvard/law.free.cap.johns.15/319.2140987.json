Bogardus, </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AgR\">There can be no doubt, that a widow has a right of dower, in an equity of redemption in land mortgaged by her husband before their marriage. <em>(Hitchcock </em>v. <em>Harrington, </em>6 <em>Johns. Rep. </em>290. <em>Collins </em>v. <em>Torrey, 7 Johns. Rep. </em>278.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b328-7\">As to this mode of proceeding under the partition act, to obtain her dower, though under the former act (1 <em>K. &amp; R. </em>513.) of partition, it might not be allowed; yet in the newly revised act, passed <em>April </em>12, 1813. (1 <em>N. R. L. </em>507\u2014513.) there are several sections, in which provision is made for proceeding in case either party is a tenant in dower, by the curtesy, or for life; and in the act passed the 15th of <em>April, </em>1814, (sess. 37. ch. 198.) provision is made for the right of dower, in case of a sale under the partition act.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b328-8\"><em>T. A. Emmet, </em>contra.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A0Ap\">This court have not yet gone the whole length of-the doctrine, contrary to the English law, <footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>that a widow may be endowed of an equity of redemption. It has only been decided, that the tenant claiming under the heir of the mortgagor was estopped to deny his <em>seisin, </em>or avail himself of the mortgage to defeat the widow\u2019s dower. [Spencer, J. <em>In Runyan </em>v. <em>Mersereau, (11 Johns. Rep. </em>534.) we held that a mortgage, at law, as well as in equity, was a mere security for money; that the mortgagee has only a chattel interest, and that the freehold remains in the mortgagor.]</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b328-9\">But there is another and a fatal objection to this action. Instead of bringing her action for dower, and before any dower has been assigned to her, the plaintiff proceeds under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>the act for partition, as if she were a tenant in common: In <em>Bradshaw </em>v. <em>Callaghan, </em>(5 <em>Johns. Rep. </em>80. <em>S. C. in Error, </em>8 <em>Johns. Rep. </em>558.) the court say that a widow\u2019s dower is not within the purview of the partition act; that she is not a <em>joint tenant, </em>or <em>tenant in common, </em>or <em>co-parcener. </em>Here is a plea of <em>non tenent insimul; </em>and how can the plaintiff make out a tenancy in common ? The plaintiff has no <em>estate, </em>until dower has been assigned to her. She has nothing but a mere right; the heir is seised of the whole estate.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b328-10\"> Vide <em>Dixon </em>v. <em>Saville, </em>1 <em>Bro. C. C. </em>325\u2014328. But in <em>Banks </em>v. <em>Sutton, 2 P. Wms. </em>700. Sir <em>Joseph Jekyll, </em>master of the rolls, held, in 1792, that a widow might be endowed of an equity of redemption, theugh there was a mortage <em>in fee </em>before marriage. The law in England is, however, taken to be as laid down in <em>Dixon </em>v. <em>Saville, (Cruise's Dig. tit. 12. ch. 2. </em>s. 12. tit. 15. ch. 3. s. 9, 10. <em>Powell on Mortgages, </em>718\u2014733.) on the mere technical ground that a mortgage in fee is analogous to a <em>trust, </em>of which- the wife was no more dowable than she was of a <em>use </em>at common law, before the statute of uses.. <em>(Attorney General </em>v. <em>Scott, Cases </em>Temp. <em>Talbot, </em>138.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b329-6\">Platt, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AYv\">delivered the opinion of the court. The widow filed her petition under the \u201c act for the partition of lands,\u201d to which the defendant pleaded <em>non tenent insimul. </em>Upon the trial of that issue, the widow claimed <em>dower </em>in the lands described in the petition; and there was a verdict for the plaintiff, subject, &amp;c.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-9\">Upon the evidence stated in the case, two questions were made on the argument:</p>\n<p id=\"b329-10\">1st. Whether a widow is entitled to dower when the husband died seized of an equity of redemption only ; having mortgaged the land before marriage ?</p>\n<p id=\"b329-11\">2d. Whether dower can be assigned under the act for the partition of lands ?</p>\n<p id=\"b329-12\">Upon the first point, I think the decisions in the cases of <em>Hitchcock </em>v. <em>Harrington, </em>(6 <em>Johns. Rep. </em>290.) and <em>Collins </em>v. <em>Torry, </em>(7 <em>Johns. Rep. </em>278.) have settled the law in favour of the widow\u2019s claim of dower.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-13\">On the second point, it was decided in the case <em>of Bradshaw </em>v. <em>Callaghan, </em>first in this court, (5 <em>Johns. </em>Rep. 80.,) and afterwards, in the court of errors, (8 <em>Johns. Rep. </em>558.,) that a tenant in dower is neither a <em>joint tenant, </em>a <em>tenant in common, </em>nor a coparcener,\u201d and, therefore, not within the purview of the \u201c act for the partition of lands ;\u201d that a partition under that act, among the other tenants, without reference to the right of dower, is valid; and that her rights cannot be affected by the partition ; nor is she liable for any part of the costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-14\">Those decisions were made under the act of the 7th of <em>April, </em>1801, (1 <em>K. &amp; R. </em>542.) which was re-enacted the 12th <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>of <em>April, </em>1813, (1 N. <em>R. L. </em>507.) with the addition of six new sections, to wit, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, and 19.</p>\n<p id=\"Appo\">The 14th and 15th sections of the new act, it is contended on the part of the plaintiff, have enlarged the purview of the former statutes so as to embrace a tenant in dower. (1 N. <em>R. L. </em>513.)</p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">The legislature in enacting those additional sections, seem to have assumed that, according to the former statute, a tenant in dower might be a party in partition. The new sections do not expressly alter the law in that particular; bu$ assuming that such a right existed, they make provison for the more convenient and effectual exercise of the right.</p>\n<p id=\"A8o\">The new provisions in the act of the 12th of <em>April, </em>1813, do not, however, alter the law as it was expounded, in the case of <em>Bradshaw </em>v. <em>Callaghan. </em>(8 <em>Johns. Rep. </em>558.) In that case the seisin of the husband was of an entire parcel of land in <em>severalty, </em>and the court decided that partition should be of the <em>whole land </em>among the heirs or devisees, without making the widow a party, but subject to her claim of dower in the whole.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-8\">But suppose the husband seized as <em>tenant in common, </em>the right of dower is correspondent; it can then be in an <em>undivided share only, </em>and a partition must be made before the dower can be assigned. May not the widow, having no interest but that of dower, be a necessary party in partition when the object is merely to sever the tenancy in common, in order to have her dower afterwards assigned ? I incline to think she may, and <em>ought, </em>to be a party to the partition in the latter case ; and if so, then the 14th section of the act of the 12th of <em>April, </em>1813, must be construed as referring to cases where the seisin of the husband was that of a <em>tenant in common. </em>Considering all the statute provisions <em>in pari materia, </em>I am of opinion that where the seisin of the husband, as in the present case, was <em>in severalty </em>; the \u201c act for the partition of lands\u201d affords no remedy for <em>setting </em>off dower.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-9\">The act of the 15th of <em>April, </em>1814, (ch. 198. s. 1.) authorizes a sale of the widow\u2019s dower in partition, where the subject is indivisible, &amp;c. provided the widow be made a party to the proceedings ; but this latter act affords no aid <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>to the plaintiff in the present case. Where the object is <em>to sell </em>the real estate under the partition act, the widow may be made a party, and then she is concluded; but she is not to be made a party in partition for the purpose of <em>setting off </em>her dower.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">The verdict for the plaintiff ought, therefore, to be set side,and the petition for partition to be dismissed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-10\">Judgment accordingly.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
