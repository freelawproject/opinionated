It appeared from the return of the court beJow, that the slave in question formerly belonged to <em>Peter Van Rensselaer, </em>of <em>Claverack, </em>in <em>Columbia </em>county, who, on or about tlie 20th <em>December, </em>1814, executed a bill of sale of the slave to <em>Ms el Woodworth, of </em>the town <em>of Claverack, </em>a very poor man, and wholly unable to maintain her, and at the same time paid him forty dollars to take her off his hands, the slave being infirm, subject to fits, and incapable of performing labour. At the time of executing the bill of sale, <em>Van Rensselaer </em>disclosed to <em>Woodworth </em>her true situation, and all her infirmities were fully set forth in the bill of sale. Soon after <em>Woodworth </em>sold the slave to <em>David C. MKinstry </em>for ten dollars, and endorsed a transfer of all his right upon the bill of sale. <em>M-Kinstry, </em>a few days after, sold her to <em>Isaac Hatch, </em>in payment of a debt due from him to <em>Hatch, </em>who soon after sold her to <em>Theodore Curtis, </em>who sold her to a man by the name of <em>Jacobs, </em>who lived out of this state, <em>Hatch and Curtis </em>were freeholders in <em>Hillsdale, </em>in <em>Columbia </em>county, and they, as well as <em>Van Rensselaer </em>and <em>MKinstry, </em>were of sufficient ability to mantain the slave. The return also stated^ that the slave was brought from Hillsdale, and left in the street in the town of <em>Claverack, </em>from whence she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>wandered into the city of <em>Hudson. </em>The court below decided that the sale from <em>Van Rensselaer </em>to <em>Woodworth </em>wag void, and affirmed the order of removal.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b292-6\"><em>James Strong, </em>for the plaintiffs in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ALD\">He cited acts sess. 36. ch. 78. s. 7. s. 33. 1 <em>N.

R. L. </em>206.) it is enacted, \u201c that if any person shall by fraud or collusion, sell, or pretend to sell, or dispose of any aged or infirm slave, to any person who is unable to maintain such slave, such sale or disposition shall be void,\u201d &amp;c.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-9\">By the 24th section of the same act, it is provided, \u201cthat if.any person shall export, or attempt to export any slave, to any place without this state, such person shall forfeit 250 dollars, and the slave shall be free.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b292-10\">\u25a0 And by the 33d section of the \u201c act for the relief and settlement of the poor,\u201d (1 <em>N. R. L. </em>2-92.) it is enacted, \u201c that it shall be lawful to remove any slave who shall have left his master, or shall have wandered from town to town, to the place- of settlement of his master, &amp;c. if such place of settlement can be found in this state ; and, if none such can be founds. then to the place from whence such slave shall have last come,\u201d Sec.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-11\">I incline to the opinion that the facts present a case within the purview of the 14th section of the act; and that the sale from <em>Van Rensselaer </em>to <em>Woodworth, </em>as it regards the town, must be deemed- <em>collusive </em>and <em>void. </em>If so, the justices who made the order of removal had a right to elect, to consider either <em>Van Rensselaer, </em>or <em>Jacobs, </em>as the master of this slave : for, as applicable to such a case, the term \u201c <em>void,,\u2019\u2019\u2019 </em>must be construed to mean \u201c voidable,\u201d at the' election of the justices who make the order. The purchasers under <em>Van .Rensselaer, </em>who have successively speculated' upon this slave, shall not he permitted for their own private benefit to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>allege the illegality of the first transfer. They each, in sue-cession, had a complete title, as against <em>Van Rensselaer, </em>and having had the benefit of their contracts, they must assume the correspondent risks.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-3\">If <em>Van Rensselaer </em>may not be regarded as the present master of the slave, on the ground that his transfer was collusive and void, then I think <em>Jacobs </em>is to be considered as the owner. For although the return states, that at the time of his purchase, <em>Jaco</em>bs <em>lived out of this state,\u201d </em>yet there is no evidence that he has \u201c <em>exported, or attempted to export, her out of the state.\u201d </em>The. forfeiture and the penalty accrue, not merely for buying a slave here, by a person living out of the state, but for carrying, or. .attempting to carry, such slave out of the state. The purchaser in such case, acquires a qualified right; that is, he may either remove to this state, and keep the slave, or he may sell her to an inhabitant of this state.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-4\">Allowing, then, that the sale by <em>Van Rensselaer </em>was <em>not </em>collusive, and that <em>Jacobs </em>is to be regarded as the true owner ; then, I think, the order of removal may be sustained; for the return states, that \u201c the said <em>Sarah </em>wandered from the town of <em>Claverack, </em>into the city of <em>Hudson;\u201d </em>which presents a case expressly provided for in the 33d section, which has been cited; to wit, that where a slave has wandered from town to town, and whose master\u2019s place of settlement cannot be found in this state, it shall be lawful to. move such slave to the place from whence such slave shall have last come, <em>&amp;c.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">On either ground, therefore, I am of opinion, that the order of the sessions was correct, and ought to be <em>affirmed.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">Spencer, J. and Yates, J. were of the same opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-7\">Thompson, Ch. J. and Van Ness, J. dissented.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-8\">Order of sessions affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
