They deem it expedient, however, to adopt certain roles for the guidance of the agent, who will make known such parts of them as are proper to individuals proposing to transact business with the company. 1. The agent is authorized to receive on consignment all goods of <em>American </em>manufacture, and to make advances on the same, not exceeding three-fourths of the market value of such goods, and requiring a receipt for the advance, with promise to refund, with interest, in case the goods should not be sold within a limited time, not exceeding one year, or should be insufficient to meet the advance. 2. The agent, with the advice of a monthly committee of two directors, may make arrangements with individuals, or manufacturing companies, for the general consignment of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>their manufactures. 3. The agent, with the advice of the game committee, may make reasonable advances on shipments of <em>American </em>manufactures. 4. The agent shall not make any other appropriation of the funds of the company, without the order of the board of directors, except the current expenses of the company, and balances due for sales. 5. The agent may agree to transact business on the following terms, &amp;c. &amp;c. The preceding regulations are deemed to be sufficient restrictions on the agent, whose general duties are pointed out, in the report made to the directors, on the 26th of April,\u201d (the material part of which was the bylaw above stated,) \u201c with which he is expected to comply.\u201d <em>Darling </em>was appointed the agent of the company, and was at the same time one of its directors.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b54-4\">At the time that the acceptance in question was made, <em>Herman Ruggles </em>gave <em>Darling </em>a receipt, stating the terms of the agreement entered into between them, and dated the 26th of <em>April, </em>1813. This receipt was as follows: \u201cReceived of <em>Noyes Darling, </em>agent of the commission company, his acceptance of my draft in favour of <em>Oliver \u00a1Ruggles, </em>at sixty days from this date, for 4,500 dollars, which acceptance is wholly for my accommodation; and which I hereby agree to return to said <em>Noyes Darling, </em>to be cancelled, on the 2d day of <em>May </em>next, or to pay him the amount of said acceptance, on said 2d day of <em>May, </em>and, as collateral security, for the return or payment of said acceptance, on said 2d of <em>May, </em>I have placed, and do hereby place, in the hands of said <em>Darling, </em>my three several notes of hand,. &amp;c. And I do agree, in consideration of the accommodation afforded by the commission company, to place in the hands of their said agent, for sale on commission, one month from the date hereof, 100 hogsheads of domestic distilled spirits.\u201d <em>Ruggles </em>neither paid the amount of the bill, nor delivered it up, nor were the spirits deposited pursuant to the agreement.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b54-5\">An entry of this acceptance was made in the bill book of the company by their secretary, and it was offered for discount, at the Merchants\u2019 <em>Bank, </em>where it was refused. <em>Ketchum, </em>a broker, testified, that, in <em>April, </em>1814, he received the bill from <em>Oliver-Ruggles </em>to raise money upon. The broket took the bill to <em>Fox </em>Leggett, and offered it to them <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>for sale; they retained it, under the pretence that they wished to examine into the state of their funds, and in the mean lime gave it to another broker, <em>Franklin, </em>who sold it to the plaintiff for 4,362 dollars <em>lb </em>cents, and paid the money to <em>Fox and </em>Leggett; out of this money they paid over to <em>Ketchum </em>the amount of the bill, deducting discount at a higher rate than had been taken by the plaintiff, and so making a profit on the transaction. <em>Ketchum </em>paid over the money which he had received, to <em>Oliver Ruggles. </em>It was proved that <em>Darling </em>had accepted a number of bills, in the same manner as the one in question, which were regularly paid by the company, but there were some acceptances which were never entered in the company\u2019s books, and the funds arising from them had never come into their hands.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b55-4\">The president of the company was a director of the <em>Merchants' Bank, </em>and was present when the bill was offered for discount, and a few hours after caused a meeting of the directors of the company to be called, to inquire into the transaction ; but, at the request of <em>Darling, </em>the business was postponed. On the 2d of <em>May, </em>when another meeting of the company was called, there was not a sufficient number present to form a board, and the next day <em>Darling </em>absconded. The company afterwards settled and compromised acceptances of <em>Darling, </em>which had not been entered in tlicir books, for the purpose of preserving their credit.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b55-5\">At the trial, <em>Herman </em>and <em>Oliver Ruggles </em>were offered by the defendants as witnesses, to prove that no rum had ever been deposited with the company, pursuant to the agreement, and that the bill was, in its inception, usurious ; but they were rejected by the judge. A verdict was taken for the plaintiff, by consent, for the amount of the bill, with interest, subject to the opinion of the court, on a case, of which such parts as appeared material are above stated.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b55-6\">The cause was argued, at a former term, by <em>Wells </em>and <em>Hoffman, </em>for the plaintiff, and by <em>T. A. Emmet, </em>and <em>D. B. Ogden, </em>for the defendants, on the two points raised by the counsel for the defendants, to wit: 1. That the defendants were not bound by the acceptance of the bill by <em>Darling. </em>2. That the transaction was usurious. At the last <em>October </em>term, the court directed a second argument, on the second point\u00bb</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b56-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>\n<em>Arguments for the plaintiff.</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AZd\"><em>1. </em>Whatever may have been the law formerly, it is now well settled, that a corporation may be bound by a contract, made by their authorized agent, <em>without </em>their seal; and that an <em>action of assumpsit </em>lies against a corporation. <em>(Stafford </em>v. <em>Albany, </em>6 <em>Johns. Rep. </em>1. <em>Danforth v. Schoharie Turnpike Company, </em>12 <em>Johns. Rep. </em>237. 10 <em>Mass. Rep. </em>295.) It is fully proved, by one of the witnesses, <em>(Jennings,) </em>that <em>Darling </em>was the general agent of the defendants, and was in the habit of accepting bills for them, and that his acceptances had been regularly paid by the defendants. It may be said, perhaps, that the defendants, by the act for their incorporation, fsess.' 36. ch. 350. s. 1, 2.) had no authority to accept bills ; but were restricted to making advances of money, on goods sent to them for sale. Though the <em>preamble </em>speaks of advances on the deposit of goods, yet the enacting clause is silent on that point, and the practice of the company had been differfent. They have not required the actual deposit of goods before making advances. The acceptance of a bill is nothing more than an agreement in writing, to advance money on a certain day specified in the bill. It is enough, that the acceptance was in the ordinary course of the defendants\u2019 business. The object of the act was merely to give the defendants, as a corporation, the power to transact business as commission merchants. An actual deposit, or a reasonable expectation of a deposit of goods, on a certain day, was sufficient to authorize the acceptance to advance the money.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b56-4\">The whole evidence goes to show that <em>Darling </em>was the <em>general agent </em>of the defendants; and he proves, also, that he acted within the scope of his authority or instructions. But whether he did so act or not, yet being the general agent of the defendants, his acts are obligatory on them. The particular instructions given to him for the regulation of his conduct may make him accountable to his principals; but the public, or third persons, are not bound to inquire into his authority; they know him only in his ostensible character as a general agent. To require that all persons dealing with such an agent should ascertain the extent of his power, would destroy all distinction between a general and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>special agent, and would render it unsafe to take even a bank note, without inquiring whether the president and cashier of the bank had any authority to sign it. It is enough that the general agent acts ostensibly within the scope of his authority. This doctrine is more especially applicable to corporations, who can act only by their agents. The distinction between general and special agents is well settled in the books. <em>(Fenn </em>v. <em>Harrison, </em>3 <em>Term Rep. </em>757. <em>Whitehead </em>v. <em>Tuckett, </em>15 <em>East, </em>400. <em>Runquist </em>v. <em>Ditchell, </em>3 <em>Esp. N. P. Cas. </em>64, 65. <em>Batty </em>v. <em>Caswell, </em>2 <em>Johns. Rep. </em>48. <em>Gibson </em>v. <em>Colt, </em>7 <em>Johns. Rep. </em>390. <em>Pothier, Trait. des Oblig. </em>n. 79.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b57-6\">Again, on principles of the <em>commercial </em>Jaw, the acceptance is binding, whether <em>D. </em>exceeded his instructions or not. This being a negotiable paper, the plaintiff, a <em>bona fide </em>holder, is not to be affected by any fraud committed in putting it into circulation. <em>(Woodhull </em>v. <em>Holmes, </em>10 <em>Johns. Rep. </em>231. <em>Peacock </em>v. <em>Rhodes, Doug. </em>633.) Admitting, how'ever, that <em>D. </em>exceeded his authority, yet the defendants have recognised and adopted his acts so as to give them validity. Where a principal is informed of the acts of his agent, and does not, in a reasonable time, express his dissent, he is presumed to assent to them, and will be bound by such implied adoption. <em>(Cairnes </em>v. <em>Bleecker, </em>12 <em>Johns. Rep. </em>300. <em>Hodgson </em>v. <em>Davies, </em>2 <em>Camp. N. P. Cas. </em>530.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b57-10\">2. As to the objection of <em>usury. </em>To avoid an instrument, on the ground of usury, it must be shown that it was, in its Inception, founded on an usurious loan of money. <em>(Scott </em>v. <em>Brest, </em>2 <em>Term Rep. </em>241.) Any subsequent taint which it may, afterwards, acquire, in being negotiated between third persons, will not destroy the original contract. The original party, maker, drawer, or acceptor, cannot object that there has been a subsequent usurious contrast between the endorser and endorsee. Then, was not this a valid bill in its inception ? It was advanced on an hypothecation or deposit of goods by <em>O, Ruggles, </em>There was no actual or implied agreement that the acceptance should be taken or used for the purpose of raising money in the market on usury. There were 400 shares, also, deposited as collateral security, O. <em>R. </em>might have brought an action on the bill <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>\u00e1g\u00e1i\u00f1st the defendants; and if <em>H. R. </em>could not, it would be \u00f3\u00f1 the ground only, that he had engaged to return the acceptance lent to him. The term <em>accommodation </em>does not imply usury. If the bank had discounted the acceptance when it was offered for that purpose, they might have recovered the amount of the defendants. O. <em>R. </em>the payee, put the bill in Circulation. He had a right to sell or negotiate it, at any fate of discount he pleased. The defendants cannot object to such a negotiation of it. It is enough that the bill was made and issued <em>bona fide, </em>without a premium paid, or usurious agreement. The cases of <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Hake, </em>(2 <em>Johns. Cas. </em>60.) and <em>Wilkie </em>v. <em>Roosevelt, </em>(3 <em>Johns. </em>Cas. 206.) are very different from the one before the court. There, a note was made and endorsed for the very purpose of raising money on it, at an usurious interest. It passed directly from the maker to the lender dr endorsee, without having been delivered to the pay\u00e9e or endorser.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A5T\">Again, after the bill came into the hands of the plaintiff, the defend\u00e1nts promised to pay it. A contract originally usurious may be made good in the hands of a <em>bona fide </em>holder, by a promise to pay him the amount. <em>(Stewart </em>v. <em>Eden, </em>2 <em>Caines' Rep. </em>150. <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Henry, </em>10 <em>Johns. Rep. </em>185. <em>Cuthbert </em>v. <em>Haley, </em>8 <em>Term Rep. </em>390. <em>Parr </em>v. <em>Eliason, 3 Esp. N. P. Cas. </em>210. <em>Prodgers </em>v. <em>Lugham, </em>1 <em>Sid. </em>133. <em>Ferral </em>v. <em>Shaen, </em>1 <em>Saund. </em>294.)</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b58-5\"><em>Arguments </em>for the <em>Defendants.</em></attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ApQ\">1. To make the acceptance binding, it must appear to have been made by the defendants in their corporate capacity, or by their agent duly authorized ; and such acceptance must be within the corporate powers of the defendants. The acceptance was made for the accommodation of <em>H. R. </em>who made no deposit of goods at the time, but merely promised, .in consideration of such accommodation, to deposit them at \u00e1 future time. The defendants are trustees for the stockholders, and hate no right to compromise their interests by any acthot clearly authorized by the act of incorporation. The preamble to the act, which is the best interpreter of the intent of the legislature, and shows its object, does not contemplate a power to enter into such a transaction. The question is not whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>the corporation made an express contract beyond its capadty, but whether an agent for them has made a contract beyond the powers of the corporation. An agent of a corporation, whether general or special, cannot do an act beyond the legal powers of the corporation. You cannot imply a power in an agent to do what the corporation itself could not have done. Where a public act of incorporation defines the powers of the corporation, or prohibits its doing certain things, every person is bound t\u00f3 know its powers, and whether an act done is authorized or not. Every company incorporated for a special purpose, being, itself, a special agent, an agent constituted by them must have a special authority, and all persons dealing with such agent must be presumed to know the extent of his authority. <em>(Hayden </em>v. <em>Mid dlesex Turnpike </em>Company, 10 <em>Mass. </em>Rep. 397. 403. <em>Sewall </em>J.) The delegation of authority by the company must be within its corporate powers.' How does it appear that <em>D. </em>was the agent of the defendants ? He must be appointed by deed, by an instrument under the corporate seal, or \u00a1by some resolution or by-law of the company. No appointment under seal appears in this case. The act of incorporation gives the defendants power only to appoint agents .to carry into effect the objects of the corporation, and no other; and the by-laws under which <em>D. </em>is supposed to derive bis authority, did not authorize him <em>to </em>make this acceptance. But it is said that <em>D. </em>was in the practice of nicking such acceptances, and that the defendants have ratified them 5 but there is no evidence of a ratification of .any acceptance not made on an actual deposit of goods; and the supposed adoption appears to have been made without a knowledge of the actual circumstances.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b59-4\">2. This bill was founded in an usurious agreement. -It was originally made for the accommodation of O. <em>R. </em>and with a view to enable hint to go into the city .and raise money upon it. It comes within the principle decided by the court, in the case of <em>Dunham </em>v. Dey, (13 <em>Johns. Rep. </em>40.) If the doctrine contended for on the part of the plaintiff is to prevail, the legislature might as well repeal the act agaipst usury, for nothing can be easier than to evade it. The declaration of Lord <em>Mansfield, </em>ip <em>Floyer v. Edwards, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>(Cowp. 114.) \u201c That where the real truth is a loan of money, the wit of man cannot find a shift to take it out of the Statute,\u201d would prove an idle saying. This was a mere accommodation bill, and after the bank had refused to discount it, O. <em>R. </em>carried it to a broker to raise m\u00f3ney on it, at 2 1-2 per cent. per month, and the broker went to the plaintiff and got it discounted at 1 1-2 per cent, per month. The sale of a note in the market is a mere evasion of the statute, a mere cover for an usurious loan. <em>(Jones </em>v. <em>Hake, </em>2 <em>Johns. Cas. </em>60. <em>Wilkie </em>v. <em>Roosevelt, 3 Johns. Cas. </em>66. 206.) Putting one\u2019s name on a note, for the mere purpose of rendering it negotiable, and to facilitate the usurious loan, is a shift and evasion of the law. But it is said, that the defendants cannot avail themselves of this subsequent usurious transaction with a third person, to avoid the payment of their acceptance. The defence may be made against any person who comes into court with impure hands, and tainted' with usury. If the endorsement for an usurious loan is void, the holder can make no title through that endorsement. If the endorsee cannot recover against his endorser, on account of the-usury, how can he maintain an action against the maker or acceptor ? Though the bill were <em>bona fide </em>in its origin, yet if it was endorsed to the plaintiff for an usurious consideration, he can never recover from any party, for he must derive his title through that endorsement, which is illegal and void. The bill never existed as an effective and negotiable ; instrument, until it was passed to the plaintiff. An <em>accommodation </em>note'or bill, has effective or legal existence only when it is transferred to a <em>bona fide </em>holder. If it is once established that the names appearing on the note were lent for accommodation, it makes no difference what is the number of endorsers, or whether the transaction assumes the shape of an acceptance or not, The form of the instrument, or the number of names on it, cannot change the real character of the transaction. The plaintiff is an usurious lender of money, not a purchaser in the market. The distinction set up, as to an innocent and <em>bona fide </em>holder, cannot avail him who\u2018is the usurer. If the instrument be originally Usurious, or if the <em>bona fide </em>holder must derive his title <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>thrtiugh an usurious endorsement, it is equally void against him.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b61-6\">Spencer, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ak7\">delivered the opinion of the court. The grounds on which the defendants resist the payment of the bill, in this case, are, 1 st. That <em>Noyes Darling, </em>the defendants\u2019 agent, exceeded his authority in accepting the bill. 2d. That the bill is usurious.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-8\">This case has been twice argued, and, the last time, by the direction of the court. The second argument has been confined to the last point, whether the bill was void for usury. The court entertained no doubts on the first point, and the second argument has removed all doubts upon the second.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-9\">(1) The defendants are a corporation, and had, it appears, duly constituted <em>Darling </em>their general agent., It has been strongly urged, that under the act incorporating this company, (sess. 36. ch. 150.) they could neither draw, nor accept bills of exchange. Their power is, undoubtedly, limited.. They are required to employ their stock solely in advancing money, when required, on goods and articles manufactured within the <em>United States, </em>and the sales of such goods and articles on commission. The acceptance of a bill is an engagement to pay money ; and the company may agree to pay or advance money, at a future day, and they may engage to do this by the acceptance of a bill.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-11\">The contract between <em>Herman Ruggles, </em>the drawer of the bill, and <em>Darling, </em>as agent to the defendants, is, that he will accept the bill, and that collateral security shall be given by <em>Ruggles </em>for the return or payment of it; but, as a consideration for the accommodation afforded by the acceptance of the bill, he was to place in the hands of the defendants\u2019 agent, 100 hogsheads of domestic distilled spirits for sale on commission, and as a further security for the acceptance. I perceive no objection arising from the act of incorporation, to the advance of money, or the acceptance of a bill, on an agreement to deposit goods or articles of domestic manufacture. The legislature have not inhibited this; nor have they required that the goods should be delivered to the company prior to their advancing money on them. Such a re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>quirement would be impolitic and embarrassing to the ffla? nufacturer and the company<em>.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b62-4\">The point principally insisted on is, that the defendant exceeded his particular instructions, as regards the acceptance of this hill, the <em>rum </em>not having \"been, in fact, deposited. The by-laws of the corporation have, been produced, and they certainly do not confer on the agent the power of accepting hills, on an expected delivery of goods. But it is proved that <em>Darling </em>was the general agent of the defendants, and that he was in the habit of accepting bills, which the company, afterwards, paid, under the like circumstances. It further appears, that the acceptance in question was entered in the books .of the company in the usual manner of all other acceptances.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-5\">The distinction is well settled, between a general and a special agent. As to the former, the principal is responsible for the acts of the agent, when acting within the general scope of hj.s authority, and the public cannot b,e supposed connusant of any private instructions from the principal .to the agent; but where the agency is. a special and temporary one, there the principal is not bound, if the agent .exceeds his employment. In Fenn v. <em>Harrison, </em>(3 <em>Term </em>Rep. 760.) <em>Ashhurst, </em>J. takes the distinction stated ; and he exemplifies it, by putting two cases. He says., if a person keeping livery stables, and having a horse to sell, direct his servant not to warrant, and the .servant nevertheless warrants him, still the master would be liable on the warranty, because the servant was acting within the general scope of his .authority. Again, he says, jf the owner of.a horse were to send a stranger to a.fair, with express directions not to warrant the horse, and. the latter acted .contrary to the orders, the purchaser could only have recourse to the person who sold the. horse, and the owner would not be liable o.n the warrantybecause, the servant was n.ot acting within the scope of ibis employment. In <em>Gibson </em>v. <em>Colt </em>and others, (7 <em>Johns. Rep. </em>393.) this court recognised the \"distinctionbetwe\u00e9n a special and generalagent, as laid down in Fenn v. <em>Harrison, </em>to be founded on just and reasonable principles, with the observation, \u201c that the limitation to the powers of a general and known agent, cannot be known, unless speci<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>ally communicated, and third persons ought not to be affected by any private instructions.\u201d The same principle was recognised by Lord <em>Kenyon, </em>in <em>Runquist </em>v. <em>Ditchell, </em>(3 <em>Esp. Rep. </em>64.) and, again, by Lord <em>Ellenborough, </em>in <em>Whitebread </em>v. <em>Tuckett, </em>(15 <em>East, </em>407.) It makes no difference, that the defendants were a corporation; for it is settled, that they may be bound by the acts of their agents, in the same manner as private individuals.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-4\">I abstain from mentioning several incidental facts, which go to confirm the position, that the defendants considered and treated <em>Darling\u2019s </em>acts as binding on them.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-5\">2. The second point was not free from doubt, and, as has been observed, led to the re-argument of the cause. The doubt in the minds of some of the judges has been removed, by a more precise ascertainment of a fact; it was doubted, whether <em>Oliver Ruggles, </em>the payee of the bill, was not a mere <em>dramatis persona, </em>and whether he could, after the acceptance of the bill, have maintained a suit upon it. Upon a more careful examination of the case, we see no reason to doubt, that the bill, whilst in his hands, and before it was discounted by the plaintiff, at a higher rate than the legal interest, was a perfect and available bill, and that when it became due, he could have maintained an action upon it, against either of the defendants, or <em>Herman Ruggles, </em>the drawer. This appears to the court to be the true test, in distinguishing between a case, where the discount of a bill, at a higher premium than the legal rate of interest, will render the transaction legal, by considering it the purchase of a bill, already perfect and available to the party holding it, and where it will be illegal, as \u00e1 usurious loan of money. The principle is too well settled to be questioned, that a bill, free from usury, in its concoction, maybe sold ata discount, by allowing the purchaser to pay less for it, than it would amount to at the legal rate of interest, for the time the bill has to run. The reason is obvious ; as the bill was free from usury, between the immediate parties to it, no after transaction with another person can, as respects those parties, invalidate it. And I take it to be equally clear, that if a bill, or note, be made for the purpose of raising money upon it, and it is discounted at a higher premium than the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>legal rate of interest, and where none of the parties whose names are on can, as between themselves, maintain a suit on the bill when it becomes mature, provided it had not been discounted, that then such discounting of the bill would be usurious, and the bill would be void. I have no doubt, that <em>Herman Ruggles </em>could, in no event, have maintained a suit on this bill. The contract between him and <em>Darling, </em>bound him either to deli ver up the bill to be cancelled, long before it would become due by the terms of it, or to pay <em>Darling </em>the amount of the bill. And it w'ould make no difference, as to the question of usury, that an attempt was made to get it discounted, at a legal rate of interest, by presenting it to a bank. Had it appeared that <em>Oliver Ruggles </em>had no interest in the bill, but had merely lent his name for the accommodation of <em>Herman Ruggles, </em>the court have no hesitation in saying, that the plaintiff\u2019s purchase of the hill would have been usurious, and that he could not have recovered upon it; because, until such purchase, the bill would have been mere waste paper, and it wpuld have had no existence, or been available, until the plaintiff acquired his title, and that title, being contaminated and infecting the bill, would be invalid as against all the parties to it. (3 <em>Johns. Cas. </em>69. 206. 2 <em>Johns. Cas. </em>60.)</p>\n<p id=\"b64-9\">It has been said, that <em>Oliver Ruggles, </em>for aught that appears, was the holder . of this bill in his own right, and could have maintained a suit to enforce its payment, when it came to maturity, against the acceptor and drawer, had it never been discounted by the plaintiff; and then'it follows,.' that the drawer and acceptor, in a suit by the endorsee, have nothing to do with the consideration paid for the bill, by such endorsee to the drawer. They are bound to pay the bill; but, as respects the payee and first endorsee, if he be sued by his immediate endorser, it will be competent for him to show the real consideration paid; and if it be less, than the face of the bill, and the legal interest for the time the bill had to run, then he can claim to have the difference deducted. <em>(Braman </em>v. <em>Hess, </em>13 <em>Johns.
