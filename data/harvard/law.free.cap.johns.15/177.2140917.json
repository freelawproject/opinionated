It appeared, from the affidavits <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>which were read, that the execution of the writ of inquiry was commenced before the sheriff and jury, at six o\u2019clock on <em>Saturday </em>evening; that the hearing of the allegations and proofs of the parties, and of the defendant\u2019s counsel, detained the jury until half past eleven o\u2019clock of <em>Saturday </em>evening, when the defendant\u2019s counsel proposed an adjournment until after <em>Sunday, </em>but the plaintiff\u2019s counsel declined an adjournment, not considering the objection to giving a verdict on <em>Sunday </em>morning, sufficient; that the jury retired to consider of their verdict about one o\u2019clock, a. m. of <em>Sunday, </em>and returned their verdict about 4 o\u2019clock, a. m. of that day. Before the jury were summoned, the plaintiff\u2019s attorney requested the sheriff not to summon two men, who were freeholders, but against whom there was some objection as to their sitting in this cause, and the sheriff omitted to summon them; and it appeared that the defendant had consented their being omitted by the sheriff. <em>T. B. </em>another freeholder and inhabitant of <em>Poughkeepsie, </em>who was summoned by the sheriff, appeared, and the plaintiff\u2019s attorney called the sheriff aside, and stated an objection to <em>T. B. </em>as a juror, and the sheriff discharged him, and put another juror on the panel. It did not appear that the defendant knew of the objection made to <em>T. B. </em>Some of the jurors stated that they understood that the defendant\u2019s counsel consented to waive any objection to proceeding with the inquiry on <em>Sunday </em>morning, otherwise they should have refused to proceed.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b186-4\"><em>Bloom </em>contended,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ARx\">that the inquisition ought to be set aside, on two grounds : 1, Because it was partly executed and taken on <em>Sunday </em>morning. 2. Because the plaintiff\u2019s attorney improperly interfered in the selection of the jurors.</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b186-5\">In support of the first point, he cited, 2 <em>N. R. L. </em>195. <em>Jacob\u2019s Law Dict. </em>140. <em>ad voc. Sunday. </em>2 <em>Inst. </em>264. 1 <em>Ld. Raym. </em>706. 8 <em>East, 547. </em>1 <em>Str. </em>387. 8 <em>Johns. Rep. </em>290. To the second point, <em>Trials per Pais, </em>169. 9 <em>Johns. Rep. </em>260. 1 <em>Coxe\u2019s New-Jersey Rep. </em>6. 169.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b186-7\"><em>P. Ruggles, </em>contra.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b187-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>\n<em>Per Curiam.</em>\n</author>\n<p id=\"A3AN\">The inquisition ought to be set aside. The writ was executed on <em>Sunday, </em>within the meaning of the statute. There was no necessity for taking the inquisition on <em>Sunday, </em>as the cause might have been adjourned over until <em>Monday. </em>It is not like the case of a trial at a circuit, where a verdict is sometimes taken on- <em>Sunday </em>morning, because the jury must, otherwise, be kept together during <em>Sunday.</em><footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b187-4\">On the second ground, also, the inquisition ought to be set aside. Though the plaintiff\u2019s attorney may have acted with good intentions, and from no improper motive, yet if there is any legal or valid objection to a juror, it ought to be openly and publicly stated, and the sheriff may then .set aside the juror against whom the objection is made, and summon another; or if he should refuse to do so, it would be ground for an application to set aside the inquisition. There must be no interference with the jury or the sheriff.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-8\">Motion granted.</p>\n<footnote label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b187-9\"><em> </em>Vide <em>Hoghtaling </em>v.
