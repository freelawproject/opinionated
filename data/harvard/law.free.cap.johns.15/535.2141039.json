K. B. Pr. </em>230. 1 <em>Sellon's Pr. </em>161. 1 <em>Taunt. Rep. </em>164. 5 <em>Johns. Rep. </em>230. 8 <em>Johns.

B. </em>that no <em>attorney </em>of that, or any other court, shall he bail, in any action depending in that court. (1 <em>Tidd's Pr. </em>230.) The same rule prevails, also, in the Court of C. B. (1 <em>Taunt. Rep. </em>164. note.) There appears to be good reason for the rule, and we, therefore, adopt it. The motion is granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-7\">The counsel for the parties agreed, that the rule should be, that the sheriff put in other sufficient bail, in <em>four days, </em>or that an attachment issue against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-8\">Rule accordingly.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
