Rep. </em>282.) It appeared from the affidavits read, that the parties were verbally informed, on the 28th of <em>June, </em>by the person employed by the widow to obtain her dower, that he should apply to the Surrogate on the 2d of <em>July, </em>for the appointment of commissioners to assign her dower; but none of the parties appeared before the Surrogate, who, on that-day, without any citation or further notice, appointed admeasurers.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b541-15\"><em>Drake, </em>contra,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"APP\">contended, that there was sufficient notice in this case, and cited the case of <em>Watkins, </em>(9 <em>Johns.

The application to the Surrogate is a legal proceeding, affecting the rights of the patties interested in the land, who ought, therefore, to be duly apprised of it. On general principle, the notice ought to be in writing, and the want of it is a fatal objection to these proceedings. The motion must be granted, but without costs, as it is not a case within the statute relative to costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-19\">Motion granted accordingly.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
