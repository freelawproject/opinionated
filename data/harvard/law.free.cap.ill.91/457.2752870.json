The statute of this State in regard to the levy and sale of capital stock on execution, is a substantial copy of the statute of New Hampshire, which has been construed to require a transfer on the books in order to protect the stock from sale on execution, even when the charter and by-laws were silent on that question, long before the statute in this State was passed.

Pennell became- the \u25a0 owner of 100 shares of stock in that company, and ten certificates, each representing ten shares of stock of the par value of $1000, were issued to him. In the body of each certificate was this language: \u201c Subject to the by-laws of said company-transferable only on the books of the company, on the surrender of this certificate.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b463-11\" pgmap=\"463(46) 464(60)\">On the 10th of November, 1873, Pennell and the Ruttan Heating and Ventilating Company being indebted to the appellant for $7400, borrowed money, Pennell assigned and delivered these certificates of stock to the appellant to secure that indebtedness, and also to procure subsequent advances to be made. The appellant has since held possession of the certificates, but no transfer of the stock of which they evidence ownership has been made on the books of the company. Of the indebtedness existing when they were assigned and delivered, there remains due $2650; and there has also been advanced $1400 since, which remains due and unpaid.</p> <p id=\"b464-5\" pgmap=\"464\">On the 7th of May, 1877, in vacation of the McLean circuit court, the appellees, Asahel and Edward B. Gridley, as \u201cA. Gridley &amp; Son,\u201d recovered . a judgment, by confession, against William A. Pennell and others for $1000, and costs of suit. On the same day execution was issued on the judgment, and the sheriff of McLean county, by virtue thereof, levied upon Pennell\u2019s shares of stock in the horse railway company, making his levy in conformity with the directions of the statute relating to levies of that description.</p> <p id=\"b464-6\" pgmap=\"464\">The appellees, Asahel and Edward B. Gridley, and the horse railway company had no actual notice that the certificates of stock had been assigned and delivered to appellant until after the levy of the execution.</p> <p id=\"b464-7\" pgmap=\"464\">The Appellate Court held that, the stock not having been transferred on the books of the horse railway company before the levy was made, the levy is entitled to priority over any claim in behalf of appellant, and this ruling presents the only question to be now determined.</p> <p id=\"b464-8\" pgmap=\"464(130) 465(34)\">Appellant insists that Kellogg v. Stockwell et al. 75 Ill. 68, settles that the ruling below was erroneous. That was a bill in equity to protect the original owner of corporate stock from assessments made by the corporation after he had sold his stock, filed by such owner against his vendee. There had been no transfer of the stock upon the books of the corporation, and there was a clause in the charter providing that shares of stock should be transferable only on the books of the corporation. It was said that this provision in the charter was designed for the protection of the company, and, perhaps, a purchaser without notice; but, it was held, as between the vendor and vendee, a sale and transfer will be good without being entered upon the company\u2019s books, and will be enforced in equity, and a decree requiring the vendee of the stock to pay or indemnify the vendor, on account of the assessments, was affirmed.</p> <p id=\"b465-5\" pgmap=\"465\">But there is no question, here, between vendor and vendee, or pledgor and pledgee. The question is between two parties having equally meritorious claims against the original owner of the stock, each claiming a prior lien over the other,\u2014the one by virtue of the pledge, the other by virtue of the levy of the execution.</p> <p id=\"b465-6\" pgmap=\"465\">Our statute provides, (Rev. Stat. 1874, p. 628, cliap. 77,):</p> <blockquote id=\"b465-7\" pgmap=\"465\">\u201c \u00a7 52. The shares or interest of a stockholder in any corporation may be taken on execution, and sold as hereinafter provided.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b465-8\" pgmap=\"465\">\u201c \u00a7 53. If the property has not been attached in the same suit, the officer shall leave an attested copy of the execution with the clerk, treasurer or cashier of the company, if there is any such officer, otherwise with any officer or person having the custody of the books and papers of the corporation; and the property shall be considered as seized on execution when the copy is so left, and shall be sold in like manner as goods and chattels.\u201d * * *</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b465-9\" pgmap=\"465\">\u201c \u00a7 55. The officer of the company who keeps a record or account of the shares or interest of the stockholders therein, shall, upon the exhibiting to him of the execution, be bound to give a certificate of the number of shares or amount of the interest held by the judgment debtor. If he refuses to do so, or if he willfully gives a false certificate thereof, he shall be liable for double the amount of all damages occasioned by such refusal or false certificate, to be recovered in any proper action, unless the judgment is satisfied by the original defendant.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b465-10\" pgmap=\"465(47) 466(22)\">\u201c \u00a7 56. An attested copy of the execution and of the return thereon shall, within fifteen days after the sale, be left with the officer of the company whose duty it is to record transfers of shares; and the purchaser shall thereupon be entitled to a certificate or certificates of the shares bought by him, upon paying the fees therefor and for recording the transfer.\u201d * * *</blockquote> <p id=\"b466-5\" pgmap=\"466\">It is too obvious to justify extended comment, that these pr-ovisions contemplate that, as against a judgment creditor, title to the stock can only pass by transfer on the books of the company, for if it might be otherwise transferred, as, by indorsement and delivery of the certificates alone, these provisions could have no practical operation.</p> <p id=\"b466-6\" pgmap=\"466\">If the mere transfer of the certificate, under contract of sale, shall sufficiently pass title, of what worth can the certificate required by \u00a7 55 be?</p> <p id=\"b466-7\" pgmap=\"466\">How can a certificate of shares purchased on execution, as provided by \u00a7 56, be of any avail, if the original certificate be out and be transferable from hand to hand, by indorsement and delivery?</p> <p id=\"b466-8\" pgmap=\"466\">Unless the books of the company is the proper place to ascertain the title of the purchaser or assignee of stock, what possible end can be subserved by requiring a copy of the execution to be left with the clerk, treasurer or cashier of the company, etc., and with what sense could it be said this should be regarded as a seizure of the stock on execution, etc.?</p> <p id=\"b466-9\" pgmap=\"466(170) 467(253)\">What we regard as the correct doctrine is well stated by the late Judge Redfield in his note to Fisher et al. v. President, Directors, etc., of the Essex Bank, 1 Am. Railway cases, 127. He says: \u201c It seems to be agreed, upon all hands, that in the case of a mere pledge of shares for the security of a debt, a formal delivery will be required to create or to consummate the contract, since it is of the very essence of a pledge that the possession be transferred to the pledgee; for as the gem eral title of the thing still remains in the pledgor, unless the possession were transferred, there would be nothing to uphold the contract. Redfield on Bailm. \u00a7\u00a7 659\u2014674, and cases cited. This may be effected by a formal or even a blank indorsement or assignment of the certificate, and delivery of the same to the assignee. Nothing more is ordinarily required to complete the contract as between the immediate parties. But, as to third parties, something more is commonly required. Some such visible or ascertainable index of the change of ownership as will naturally put those interested in the question upon inquiry, and thus lead them to correct information upon the subject, must exist. 1 Story Eq. Jur. \u00a7 421b, and cases cited in note. Some of the American States have attempted to maintain a different rule, as, that the assignment, being complete between the parties, will be held good as to third parti\u00e9h whose rights are subsequently acquired and perfected by actual possession, without knowledge of the prior transfer. Muir v. Schenck, 3 Hill (N. Y.), 228, and case cited by Cowen, J.in the opinion of the court. But this rule has never obtained in England, and only to a very limited extent in this country, and is repudiated by all the best authorities. 1 Story Eq. Jur. \u00a7 412c, and cases cited. But we think there can be no fair question that where the law of the State, as applicable to corporations, whether it be by a provision in the charter of the particular company or by a general statute, or settled course of decisions in the courts, requires that shares shall be transferred in a particular mode, as, in the present case, that they shall be transferable only at its banking house and \u00f3n its books,\u2019 there must be a substantial compliance with the requirement, in order to protect the property against future assignments or levies.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b467-6\" pgmap=\"467\">These views are sustained by Fisher et al. v. President, etc., of the Essex Bank, 5 Gray, 373; Sabin v. Bank of Woodstock, 21 Vt. 353; Oxford Turnpike v. Bunnell, 6 Conn. 558; Pinkerton v. Manchester and Lawrence Railroad Co. 42 N.
