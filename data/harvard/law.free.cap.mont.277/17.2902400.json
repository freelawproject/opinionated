Lacock (Lacock) appeals from the jury verdict of the Fourth Judicial District Corut, Missoula County, concluding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>that negligence on the part of defendant, 4B\u2019s Restaurant (4B\u2019s), was not the proximate cause of Lacock\u2019s damages. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-4\">The dispositive issue on appeal is whether the District Court abused its discretion in giving the jury an instruction on proximate cause which omitted the last sentence of Montana Pattern Instruction No. 2.06.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-5\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b43-6\">In the early morning of February 27,1990, Lacock patronized the 4B\u2019s restaurant on East Broadway in Missoula, Montana. The only other patron, Clifford Harper, shot and killed the janitor of the 4B\u2019s and shot and wounded Lacock. Lacock brought a claim against 4B\u2019s alleging that 4B\u2019s negligence was responsible for his injuries. Lacock claimed that 4B\u2019s should have foreseen and prevented the shooting. After a six-day trial, the jury returned a verdict in favor of 4B\u2019s. The District Court denied Lacock\u2019s motion for a new trial. Lacock appeals from this determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b43-8\">On appeal Lacock raises twenty issues, however, we will address only the following dispositive issue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b43-9\">Did the District Court abused its discretion in giving a jury instruction on proximate cause which omitted the last sentence of Montana Pattern Instruction No. 2.06?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b43-10\">Lacock offered the following instruction based on Montana Pattern Instruction (MPI) No. 2.06 on negligence and proximate cause:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b43-11\">The Defendant is liable if its negligence was a cause of fact and a proximate cause of plaintiff\u2019s injury. The Defendant\u2019s conduct is a proximate cause of the Plaintiff\u2019s injury if it appears from the facts and circumstances surrounding the incident that an ordinarily prudent person could have foreseen that injury to someone situated as Plaintiff was would [sic] be a natural and probable consequence of the conduct. <em>However, the specific injury [that] actually occurred need not have been foreseen. </em>[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b43-12\">4B\u2019s objected to this instruction on two grounds. First, 4B\u2019s argued that the last sentence was misleading. Second, 4B\u2019s asserted that the instruction 4B\u2019s offered on proximate cause, which excluded the final sentence, was a correct and complete statement of the law taken directly from <em>Kitchen Krafters, Inc. v. Eastside Bank of Montana </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>(1990), 242 Mont. 155, 169, 789 P.2d 567, 575. The court agreed and gave the following Instruction No. 14, as proposed by 4B\u2019s:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b44-4\">Causation, for purposes of legal liability, consists of two elements\u2014 cause in fact and proximate cause. Defendant\u2019s conduct is a cause in fact if it helped produce the damage to Plaintiff and if the damage would not have occurred without it. In addition, for Defendant\u2019s conduct to be the proximate cause of Plaintiff\u2019s injury, it must appear from the facts and circumstances surrounding Defendant\u2019s act that it, as an ordinarily prudent person, could have foreseen that the injury would be the natural and probable consequence of the wrongful act. Both elements of causation must be established by Plaintiff by a preponderance of the evidence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b44-5\">Thus, the last sentence in MPI No. 2.06 which states: \u201cHowever, the specific injury that actually occurred need not have been foreseen,\u201d was not given to the jury. Lacock argues that this sentence is essential to a correct statement of the law and without it the jury was instructed that, in order to prevail on liability, Lacock had to prove that 4B\u2019s could foresee the specific injury that actually occurred. 4B\u2019s asserts that Instruction No. 15 cured any error in Instruction No. 14. Instruction No. 15, as given to the jury, states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b44-6\">Proximate cause is analyzed in terms of foreseeability. The Defendant is not liable for the independent intervening act of another if such act was not reasonably foreseeable. In order to impose liability on the 4B\u2019s, you must determine that the <em>4B\u2019s reasonably should have foreseen the sequence of events leading to the Plaintiff\u2019s injuries. </em>[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b44-7\">Clearly, Instruction No. 15 does not cure the court\u2019s failure to instruct that \u201cthe specific injury that actually occurred need not have been foreseen.\u201d MPI 2.06. To the contrary, it compounds the problem by instructing the jury that the sequence of events leading to Lacock\u2019s specific injury should have been foreseen.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-8\">Our standard of review for discretionary trial court rulings is whether the district court abused its discretion. <em>Ganz v. U.S. Cycling Federation </em>(1995), 273 Mont. 360, 367, 903 P.2d 212, 216; <em>Barthule v. Karman </em>(1994), 268 Mont. 477, 487, 886 P.2d 971, 977. We have held that a district court has discretion regarding the instructions it gives or refuses to give a jury and that we will not reverse a district court on the basis of its instructions absent an abuse of discretion. <em>Cechovic v. Hardin &amp; Assocs. </em>(1995), 273 Mont. 104, 116, 902 P.2d 520, 527. When we examine whether jury instructions were properly given or refused, we consider the instructions in their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>entirety, as well as in connection with the other instructions given and the evidence at trial. <em>Story v. City of Bozeman </em>(1993), 259 Mont. 207, 222, 856 P.2d 202, 211. It is not reversible error for a district cotut to refuse an offered instruction unless the refusal affects the substantial rights of the party who proposed the instruction. <em>Ganz, </em>903 P.2d at 216; <em>Barthule, 886 </em>P.2d at 977.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-4\">In the instant case, we determine that the District Court\u2019s elimination of the final sentence from MPI 2.06 did affect Lacock\u2019s substantial rights. Considering Instruction No. 14 in conjunction with Instruction No. 15, the District Court essentially instructed the jury that in order to find liability it had to find that 4B\u2019s foresaw the particular injury to Lacock. In other words, to prove 4B\u2019s liability, Lacock would have to prove that 4B\u2019s failed to act, despite the fact that it could foresee specific injury to Lacock as a result of its inaction. Such proof would be tantamount to proving intentional rather than negligent conduct. That is, that 4B\u2019s failed to act knowing full well that its inaction would injure Lacock in a particular manner. Montana law does not support such a narrow instruction on foreseeability.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-5\">While 4B\u2019s characterization of the holding of <em>Kitchen Krafters </em>is not incorrect, it is an incomplete characterization of Montana law on proximate cause. In <em>Kitchen Krafters </em>we determined that a proper instruction on proximate cause should be worded as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b45-6\">In order for the defendant\u2019s negligence (failure to disclose) to be the proximate cause of the plaintiff\u2019s injury, it must appear from the facts and circumstances surrounding the accident [the nondisclosure] <em>that the defendant as an ordinarily prudent person, could have foreseen that the plaintiff\u2019s injury would be the natural and probable consequence of the wrongful act. </em>[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AZ\"><em>Kitchen Krafters, </em>789 P.2d at 575.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-7\">However, <em>Kitchen Krafters </em>must be read in conjunction with \u00a7 27-1-317, MCA, which provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b45-8\">For the breach of an obligation not arising from contract, the measure of damages, except where otherwise expressly provided by this code, is the amount which will compensate for all the detriment proximately caused thereby, <em>whether it could have been anticipated or not. </em>[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b45-9\">The last sentence in MPI 2.06 reflects the statutory proposition that the specific injury to a plaintiff need not have been anticipated or foreseen. In the interest of coordinating <em>Kitchen Krafters </em>and \u00a7 27-1-317, MCA, the Commission on Civil Jury Instructions added the last sentence in MPI 2.06, \u201c[h]owever, the specific injury that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>actually occurred need not have been foreseen.\u201d This sentence is crucial in incorporating the meaning and intent of \u00a7 27-1-317, MCA. Without the last sentence of MPI 2.06 the jury will, as here, mistakenly be led to believe that the defendant, in order to be held liable, must foresee the specific injury to the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-4\">Recently, in <em>Busta v. Columbus Hosp. Corp. </em>(1996), [276 Mont. 342], 916 P.2d 122 we clarified the law in Montana regarding the role of foreseeability in the law of negligence. The instant case must be retried pursuant to our holding in <em>Busta. See Galarneau v. Porter </em>(1996), [275 Mont. 174], 911 P.2d 1143, 1149-50 (concerning the retroactivity of judicial decisions). <em>In Busta, </em>we held that foreseeability should be addressed as an element of duty and not as an element of causation. <em>Busta </em>does, however, carve an exception for addressing foreseeability in cases in which an intervening cause is alleged. In intervening cause cases, it will be necessary for the court to discuss foreseeability in the course of explaining to the jury which intervening causes sever the chain of causation and which do not. In doing so, it will be necessary to instruct the jury consistently with the provisions of \u00a7 27-1-317, MCA, that is, that the specific injury to a plaintiff need not have been foreseen.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-5\">Here, the instruction offered by Lacock, and specifically the last sentence of MPI 2.06, was objected to by 4B\u2019s and withdrawn by the court. An instruction that was neither a Montana Pattern Instruction nor the exact wording from <em>Kitchen Krafters </em>was given. The deletion of the last sentence of MPI 2.06 was not cured by the content of other instructions, rather, its absence was exacerbated by the wording of Instruction No. 15. We hold that giving a intervening cause instruction without advising the jury that \u201cthe specific injury that actually occurred need not have been foreseen\u201d amounted to an incomplete and misleading instruction on the law. The failure to instruct that a defendant can be liable for damages whether the specific injury to the plaintiff could have been anticipated or not, affected Lacock\u2019s substantial rights, particularly since the jury found that 4B\u2019s was negligent, that 4B\u2019s negligence was the cause in fact of Lacock\u2019s damages, but that 4B\u2019s negligence was not the proximate cause of Lacock\u2019s damages. Consequently, the District Court abused its discretion in failing to instruct the jury that the specific injury that actually occurred need not have been foreseen.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-6\">Reversed and remanded for proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b46-7\">JUSTICES GRAY, ERDMANN, HUNT and TRIEWEILER concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
