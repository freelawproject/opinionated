Pursuant to \u00a7 46-12-204(3), MCA, Helfrich reserved the right to appeal from the District Court\u2019s order denying his motion to dismiss the charges. We reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-15\">The following issues are raised on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b477-16\">1. Is \u00a7 45-8-212, MCA, which defines the offense of criminal defamation, unconstitutionally overbroad?</p>\n<p id=\"b477-17\">2. Did the District Court err in denying Helfrich\u2019s motion to dismiss the charge of stalking?</p>\n<p id=\"b477-18\">On or about May 30 or May 31,1994, Helfrich distributed fliers in various locations in Silver Bow County, Montana. The fliers alleged that a named individual had engaged in criminal conduct. Based on Helfrich\u2019s distribution of the fliers, the Silver Bow Deputy County Attorney filed two complaints in Justice Court, the first alleging that Helfrich committed the offense of criminal defamation in violation of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>\u00a7 45-8-212(2), MCA, and the second alleging that Helfrich committed the offense of misdemeanor stalking in violation of \u00a7 45-5-220(l)(b), MCA. A bench trial was held in Justice Court and the court found Helfrich guilty of both offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-4\">Helfrich appealed his convictions to the District Court and filed a motion to dismiss the charges of defamation and stalking on the grounds that the criminal defamation statute is unconstitutional and that his actions did not constitute stalking within the meaning of the stalking statute. The District Court denied the motion to dismiss and Helfrich entered conditional guilty pleas reserving his right to appeal. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">1. Is \u00a7 45-8-212, MCA, which defines the offense of criminal defamation, unconstitutionally overbroad?</p>\n<p id=\"b478-6\">In reviewing the constitutionality of a statute enacted by the legislature, this Court presumes that the statute is constitutional. <em>State v. Lilburn </em>(1994), 265 Mont. 258, 266, 875 P.2d 1036, 1041, <em>cert. </em>denied, _ U.S. _, 115 S.Ct. 726, 130 L.Ed.2d 630 (1995) (citing <em>Montana Auto Ass\u2019n v. Greeley </em>(1981), 193 Mont. 378, 382, 632 P.2d 300, 303). The reviewing Court must adopt a construction of the statute which renders the statute constitutional in preference to one which renders it invalid. <em>Monroe v. State </em>(1994), 265 Mont. 1, 3, 873 P.2d 230, 231. The party challenging the constitutionality of the statute carries the burden of proof. <em>Monroe, </em>873 P.2d at 231; <em>GBN, Inc. v. Montana Dep\u2019t of Revenue </em>(1991), 249 Mont. 261, 265, 815 P.2d 595, 597.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-9\">In reviewing statutes which have been challenged under the doctrine of overbreadth, this Court has stated that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-10\">\u201c[A]n individual whose own speech or expressive conduct may validly be prohibited or sanctioned is permitted to challenge a statute on its face because it also threatens others not before the court \u2014 those who desire to engage in legally protected expression but who may refrain from doing so rather than risk prosecution or undertake to have the law declared partially invalid.\u201d <em>Brockett v. Spokane Arcades, Inc. </em>(1985), [472] U.S. [491], [504], 105 S.Ct. 2794, 2802, 86 L.Ed.2d 394, 405-406. Thus, the statute may be unconstitutional on its face even though it would be constitutional as applied to appellant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b478-11\"><em>State v. Lance </em>(1986), 222 Mont. 92, 99, 721 P.2d 1258, 1263. The statute at issue, \u00a7 45-8-212, MCA, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-12\">(1) Defamatory matter is anything which exposes a person or a group, class, or association to hatred, contempt, ridicule, degrada<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>tion, or disgrace in society or injury to his or its business or occupation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-4\">(2) Whoever, with knowledge of its defamatory character, orally, in writing, or by any other means communicates any defamatory matter to a third person without the consent of the person defamed commits the offense of criminal defamation and may be sentenced to imprisonment for not more than 6 months in the county jail or a fine of not more than $500, or both.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-5\">(3) <em>Violation of subsection (2) is justified if:</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-6\">\n<em>(a) the defamatory matter is true and is communicated with good motives and for justifiable ends;</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-7\">(b) the communication is absolutely privileged;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-8\">(c) the communication consists of fair comment made in good faith with respect to persons participating in matters of public concern;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-9\">(d) the communication consists of a fair and true report or a fair summary of any judicial, legislative, or other public or official proceedings; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-10\">(e) the communication is between persons each having an interest or duty with respect to the subj ect matter of the communication and is made with the purpose to further such interest or duty.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-11\">(4) No person shall be convicted on the basis of an oral communication of defamatory matter except upon the testimony of at least two other persons that they heard and understood the oral statement as defamatory or upon a plea of guilty. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A7V\">In the instant case, Helirich contends that \u00a7 45-8-212, MCA, is overbroad because the statute allows a criminal conviction for an alleged defamation by a lesser standard than that which is required in a civil action for defamation. In a civil action, truth is an absolute defense barring any recovery by the plaintiff. <em>New York Times, Co. v. Sullivan </em>(1964), 376 U.S. 254, 277-78, 84 S.Ct. 710, 724-25, 11 L.Ed.2d 686. Helirich contends that truth should also be an absolute defense to a criminal prosecution for defamation. He notes, however, that under \u00a7 45-8-212(3), MCA, truth alone is not sufficient. Rather, the statute requires not only a showing of truth but also a showing that the alleged defamatory matter \u201cis communicated for good motives and for justifiable ends.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b479-14\">In <em>Madison v. Yunker </em>(1978), 180 Mont. 54, 67, 589 P.2d 126, 133, this Court adopted the defamation standard set forth in <em>New York Times. </em>One of the principles established in <em>New York Times </em>is that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>truth is an absolute defense.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Helfrich argues, relying on <em>New York Times, </em>that a showing of good motives and justifiable ends is not required to defend a civil defamation action and such a showing should not be required to avoid criminal liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-4\">As the State concedes, the vast majority of courts which have addressed the constitutionality of criminal defamation statutes which require, as a defense, that the alleged defamatory material be communicated with good motives and for justifiable ends, have declined to judicially narrow the statutes and, therefore, have found such statutes to be unconstitutional. <em>See e.g., Tollett v. United States </em>(8th Cir. 1973), 485 F.2d 1087; <em>Gottschalk v. State </em>(Alaska 1978), 575 P.2d 289; <em>Weston v. State </em>(Ark. 1975), 528 S.W.2d 412; <em>People v. Ryan </em>(Colo. 1991), 806 P.2d 935, <em>cert. denied, </em>502 U.S. 860, 112 S.Ct. 177, 116 L.Ed.2d 140; <em>Commonwealth v. Armao </em>(Pa. 1972), 286 A.2d 626; <em>Eberele v. Municipal Court </em>(Cal. Ct. App. 1976), 127 Cal.Rptr. 594; <em>State v. Powell </em>(N.M. Ct. App. 1992), 839 P.2d 139. For example, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court declined, as a wholly inappropriate judicial activity, the state\u2019s request that the court narrow and, in effect, redraft Pennsylvania\u2019s criminal libel statute to comport with the First Amendment. <em>Armao, 286 </em>A.2d at 632.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-5\">In <em>Armao, </em>the Pennsylvania Supreme Court stated that \u201c[h]ence, under present Pennsylvania law, a conviction for criminal libel could conceivably be based on a true statement, published maliciously, for non-justifiable ends tending to disgrace and degrade the libeled person.\u201d <em>Armao, </em>286 A.2d at 628 n.7. The court held that \u201cthe statutory language makes no provision for truth being an absolute defense. Likewise, no recognition is given the reckless disregard and knowing falsity standard mandated <em>by New York Times </em>and <em>Garrison [Garrison v. Louisiana </em>(1964), 379 U.S. 64, 78, 85 S.Ct. 209, 217, 13 L.Ed.2d 125].\u201d <em>Armao, </em>286 A.2d at 629. The <em>Armao </em>court concluded that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-6\">[o]nly a knowing falsity or reckless disregard of the truth are actionable in civil defamation. It would violate all sound and fundamental principles of justice to have a merely negligent statement an occasion for the imposition of criminal penalties, and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>First Amendment as interpreted by the United States Supreme Court forbids such a result.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b481-5\"><em>Armao, </em>286 A.2d at 632.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-6\">Similarly, in <em>Weston, </em>the Arkansas Supreme Court, in interpreting a statute which, like \u00a7 45-8-212, MCA, allowed truth as a defense only if good faith and justification were proved, determined that the statute was unconstitutional. Recognizing that, although the statute provided that truth \u201cmay be given in evidence,\u201d the court nonetheless determined that this falls short of the <em>New York Times </em>rule which \u201cabsolutely prohibits the punishment of truthful criticism.\u201d <em>Weston, </em>528 S.W.2d at 415 <em>(citing Garrison, </em>379 U.S. at 78, 85 S.Ct. at 217-18).</p>\n<p id=\"b481-7\">The <em>Weston </em>court noted that \u201cunder the rule laid down in <em>Garrison, </em>truth is a defense even when the offending publication is not made \u201cwith good motives and for justifiable ends. ...\u2019 \u201d <em>Weston, </em>528 S.W.2d at 415. The court rejected the state of Arkansas\u2019 request to limit application of the libel statute to comport with the First and Fourteenth Amendments. Accordingly, the court held that the statute was unconstitutional \u201cunder the rulings of the U.S. Supreme Court in <em>New York Times v. Sullivan, supra, </em>and <em>Garrison v. Louisiana, supra.\u201d Weston, </em>528 S.W.2d at 416.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-8\">Section 45-8-212(3)(a), MCA, parallels the Arkansas statute in that it recognizes truth as a defense only if it <em>\u201cis communicated with good motives and for justifiable ends.\u201d </em>Both the Arkansas Supreme Court and the Pennsylvania Supreme Court determined that statutes substantially the same as Montana\u2019s were inconsistent with the United States Supreme Court\u2019s rulings in both <em>New York Times </em>and <em>Garrison </em>because such statutes prohibited true speech unless \u201ccommunicated with good motives and justifiable ends.\u201d As the <em>Weston </em>court recognized, truth is a defense even when the offending publication is not made \u201cwith good motives and for justifiable ends.\u201d We agree with the reasoning and analysis of the Arkansas Supreme Court and the Pennsylvania Supreme Court. Like the statutes at issue in <em>Weston </em>and <em>Armao, </em>\u00a7 45-8-212, MCA, impermissibly requires the defendant to prove that the material, even if true, was communicated in good faith and for justifiable ends. Unlike the civil standard for defamation set forth in <em>New York Times </em>and adopted by this Court in <em>Madison, </em>the statute does not allow for truth as an absolute defense.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b482-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>Article II, \u00a7 7 of the Montana Constitution provides that, in prosecutions for libel and slander, \u201cthe truth thereof may be given in evidence.\u201d The constitutional guarantee found in Article II, \u00a7 7 of the Montana Constitution, stands for something more than the proposition that truth is admissible. The provision means that, as a matter of state constitutional law, truth alone is sufficient as a defense \u2014 an absolute defense. The legislature cannot dilute this basic proposition by providing that while truth may be given in evidence, it is only a defense to a prosecution for libel or slander if it is for good motives and for justifiable ends. Accordingly, we determine that \u00a7 45-8-212, MCA, is unconstitutionally overbroad. It violates the First and Fourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution as interpreted by the United States Supreme Court in <em>New York Times </em>and <em>Garrison </em>and Article II, \u00a7 7 of the Montana Constitution because, on its face, the statute prohibits truthful criticism when not communicated for good motives and justifiable ends.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-4\">2. Did the District Court err in denying Helfrich\u2019s motion to dismiss the charge of stalking?</p>\n<p id=\"b482-5\">Helfrich argues that since his act of distributing fliers cannot constitute criminal defamation, it likewise cannot constitute stalking under \u00a7 45-5-220, MCA. This argument ignores the fact that his challenges to the two statutes are not parallel. Helfrich made a facial challenge to the criminal defamation statute. That is, he argued, and we agree, that the criminal defamation statute is overly broad since, on its face, it prohibits truthful criticism when not communicated for good motives and justifiable ends. On the other hand, his attack on the stalking statute is an \u201cas applied\u201d challenge. The stalking statute is not facially defective since it specifically does not apply to constitutionally protected activities such as truthful communications. The burden is on the defendant to prove that his activity is constitutionally protected. Thus, although we assumed, <em>arguendo, </em>that the fliers were true for purposes of resolving the constitutionality of the criminal defamation statute, no such assumption is warranted in the context of the stalking statute. Rather, Helfrich must prove that his communication was, in fact, true in order to set the stage for his \u201cas applied argument.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b482-6\">The complaint alleged \u201cthat the Defendant, RICHARD L. HELFRICH purposely or knowingly caused [Doe<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>] substantial emotional distress by repeatedly harassing, threatening or intimidating [Doe] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>in person or by other action, specifically by posting fliers at various locations within Silver Bow County alleging that [Doe] has engaged in criminal conduct.\u201d The State alleged that this conduct constituted the crime of misdemeanor stalking in violation of \u00a7 45-5-220(l)(b), MCA. Section 45-5-220, MCA, provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b483-4\">(1) A person commits the offense of stalking if the person purposely or knowingly causes another person substantial emotional distress or reasonable apprehension of bodily injury or death by repeatedly:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b483-5\">(a) following the stalked person; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b483-6\">(b) harassing, threatening, or intimidating the stalked person, in person or by phone, by mail, or by other action, device, or method.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b483-7\">(2) This section does not apply to a constitutionally protected activity.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b483-8\">In the instant case, the record does not disclose whether the information contained in the fliers distributed by Helfrich was true or false. As we established earlier in this opinion, true communications are constitutionally protected; thus, truth is an absolute defense to a prosecution for criminal defamation as well as to a civil defamation suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-9\">Assuming that Helfrich\u2019s fliers contained truthful information and were otherwise lawfully posted, then the act of posting the fliers may be a constitutionally protected activity within the exception of \u00a7 45-5-220(2), MCA. We say \u201cmay\u201d because truth is not an absolute defense to a charge of stalking. Unlike a charge of criminal or civil defamation which focuses solely on the content of the speech, a charge of stalking focuses on conduct which may, but does not necessarily, involve speech. Depending upon the nature, timing, context and frequency of the speech, a truthful communication may or may not be a constitutionally protected activity under \u00a7 45-5-220(2), MCA. That \u201cyou cheated on your tax return\u201d may be a truthful statement but that does not necessarily mean that I have the right to telephonically remind you of that fact every morning at 2:00 a.m. A jury may well consider such conduct to be harassment under the stalking statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-10\">In the present case we are not called upon to decide whether a particular truthful statement contained in a flier is constitutionally protected from a stalking charge because there has been no threshold <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>allegation or determination that the statement in question was truthful. To qualify as protected speech, it must at least be truthful. Beyond that, there must be a determination as to whether, albeit truthful, the statement is an element of conduct which is harassing, intimidating or threatening within the purview of the stalking statute. Even though the conduct may include protected speech, the State\u2019s interest in shielding the victim from such conduct may outweigh the defendant\u2019s constitutional protections. As Helfrich concedes, under <em>Madison, </em>not all speech is protected. <em>Madison, </em>589 P.2d at 130; <em>State v. Cooney </em>(1995), 271 Mont. 42, 48-49, 894 P.2d 303, 307. For example, this Court has held that threats are not protected speech under the Fifth Amendment. <em>Cooney, </em>894 P.2d at 307 (citing <em>Lance, </em>721 P.2d at 1266). We also recognized that \u201c[t]here are certain well-defined and narrowly limited classes of speech, the prevention and punishment of which have never been thought to raise any Constitutional problems. These include the lewd and obscene, the profane, [and] the libelous. ...\u201d <em>Lance, </em>721 P.2d at 1265 (quoting <em>Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire </em>(1942), 315 U.S. 568, 571-72, 62 S.Ct. 766, 768-69, 86 L.Ed. 1031). Activities which are intended to embarrass, annoy or harass are not protected by the First Amendment. <em>People v. Holt </em>(Ill. 1995), 649 N.E.2d 571, 581 (citing <em>Colten v. Kentucky </em>(1972), 407 U.S. 104, 109, 92 S.Ct. 1953, 1956, 32 L.Ed.2d 584) (holding that actions taken solely to annoy and inconvenience are not given constitutional protection).</p>\n<p id=\"b484-4\">On the other hand, if the information in Helfrich\u2019s fliers were false or not lawfully posted, it would not qualify as a constitutionally protected activity and the \u00a7 45-5-220(2), MCA, exception would not prohibit a prosecution for stalking.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">Without expressing any views as to whether the posting of truthful fliers constitutes the crime of stalking or is a constitutionally protected activity, we remand this matter pursuant to \u00a7 46-12-204(3), MCA, for the purpose of allowing Helfrich to withdraw his plea of guilty to the charge of stalking and, if he so chooses, to raise and prove that his conduct falls within the constitutionally protected activity exception of \u00a7 45-5-220(2), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-6\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b484-7\">CHIEF JUSTICE TURNAGE, JUSTICES GRAY, TRIEWEILER, HUNT, NELSON and ERDMANN concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b480-7\">. We note that this Court has previously recognized that \u201cthe truth of a defamatory statement of fact is a complete defense to an action for defamation.\u201d <em>Griffin v. Opinion Publishing Co. </em>(1943), 114 Mont. 502, 507, 138 P.2d 580, 584. However, later in that opinion, the Court also stated that \u201c[elvery person has a right to comment on matters of public interest and general concer, <em>provided he does so fairly and with an honest purpose.\u201d </em>lb the extent that this statement can be interpreted to require the defendant to prove good faith and justifiable ends as a defense, it is expressly overruled.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b481-9\">.
