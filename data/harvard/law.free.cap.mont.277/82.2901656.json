We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-21\">The following issue-is raised on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b107-22\">Did the District Court err in determining that \u00a7 46-23-1031(l)(a), MCA, does not violate the prohibition against ex post facto laws as applied to parolees and probationers sentenced prior to July 1,1993?</p>\n<p id=\"b108-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>Frazier alleges that HB 673, passed by the 1993 Montana Legislature and codified at \u00a7 46-23-1031, MCA, which requires probationers and parolees to pay a $10 per month supervision fee violates the prohibition against ex post facto laws contained in Article I, \u00a7 10 of the United States Constitution and Article II, \u00a7 31 of the Montana Constitution. Section 46-23-1031, MCA, provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AM\">(1) (a) Except as provided in subsection (l)(b), a probationer or parolee shall pay a supervisory fee of $120 a year, prorated at $10 a month for the number of months under supervision. The fee must be collected by the clerk of the district court with jurisdiction during the probationer\u2019s or parolee\u2019s period of supervision under this part.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-4\">(b) The court or th\u00e9 board may reduce or waive the fee or suspend the monthly payment of the fee if it determines that the payment would cause the probationer or parolee a significant financial hardship.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b108-5\">The ex post facto clause, Article II, \u00a7 31 of the Montana Constitution, provides that \u201c[n]o ex post facto law nor any law impairing the obligation of contracts, or making any irrevocable grant of special privileges, franchises, or immunities, shall be passed by the legislature.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b108-6\">In reviewing a district court\u2019s conclusions of law we determine whether the district court\u2019s interpretation of the law is correct. <em>Stratemeyer v. Lincoln County </em>(1996), [276 Mont. 67], 915 P.2d 175, 177 (citing <em>Steer, Inc. v. Department of Revenue </em>(1990), 245 Mont. 470, 474-75, 803 P.2d 601, 603-04). Here, the District Court concluded that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-7\">Since the costs and fees assessed pursuant to \u00a7 46-23-1031, Mont. Code Ann., are for the costs of providing supervision and programs by the department and are not imposed as a penalty or punishment for the crime for which the offender was convicted, application of the monthly supervision fees to all offenders on active supervision on or after the effective date of the legislation does not constitute an ex post facto application of the statute.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ax\">Frazier asserts that he was sentenced prior to the enactment of \u00a7 46-23-1031, MCA, and that the statute cannot be retroactively applied to him and other probationers and parolees similarly situated. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-8\">\u201c[F]or a criminal or penal law to be <em>ex post facto </em>... it must be retrospective, that is, it must apply to events occurring before its enactment, and it must disadvantage the offender affected by it.\u201d <em>Bae </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number><em>v. Shalala </em>(7th Cir. 1995), 44 F.3d 489, 492 (quoting <em>Weaver v. Graham </em>(1981), 450 U.S. 24, 28, 101 S.Ct. 960, 964, 67 L.Ed.2d 17). This Court has held that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-4\">It is settled, by decisions of this Court so well known that their citation may be dispensed with, that any statute which punishes as a crime an act previously committed, which was innocent when done; <em>which makes more burdensome the punishment for a crime, after its commission, </em>or which deprives one charged with a crime of any defense available according to law at the time when the act was committed, is prohibited as ex post facto.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b109-5\"><em>State v. Leistiko </em>(1992), 256 Mont. 32, 36, 844 P.2d 97, 99-100 (quoting <em>Beazell v. Ohio </em>(1925), 269 U.S. 167, 169-70, 46 S.Ct. 68, 68-69, 70 L.Ed. 216).</p>\n<p id=\"b109-6\">Frazier relies on this Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Leistiko </em>to support his argument that the supervision fee violates the prohibition against ex post facto laws. In <em>Leistiko, </em>we stated that in determining whether legislation violates the ex post facto clause a two-part test must be used. First, the law must be retrospective and, second, the law must disadvantage the affected offender. <em>Leistiko, </em>844 P.2d at 100 (citing <em>Miller v. Florida </em>(1987), 482 U.S. 423, 430, 107 S.Ct. 2446, 2451, 96 L.Ed.2d 351). A law is retrospective if it changes the legal consequences of actions committed prior to the law\u2019s effective date. <em>Leistiko, </em>844 P.2d at 100. As to the second factor, in <em>Leistiko, </em>we determined that \u201cthe additional restitution ordered ... constitutes an unconstitutional increase in punishment which Leistiko could not have foreseen at the time he committed the crime ....\u201d <em>Leistiko, </em>844 P.2d at 100.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-7\"><em>Leistiko </em>is distinguishable from the instant case. In <em>Leistiko, </em>we determined that the district court erred in increasing Leistiko\u2019s restitution obligation. Under the statute in effect at the time of Leistiko\u2019s initial sentencing the district court did not have the discretion to add additional terms and conditions to the suspended sentence. A later amendment to the statute gave the district court this discretion. However, we determined that application of the later statute to Leistiko and imposition of an additional $10,000 in restitution violated the ex post facto prohibition and constituted an unconstitutional increase in punishment. <em>Leistiko, </em>844 P.2d at 100. In the instant case, a civil administrative fee has been assessed against Frazier to help defray the costs of supervision. A civil sanction will implicate ex post facto concerns only if it can be fairly characterized as punishment. <em>Bae, </em>44 F.3d at 492 (citing <em>United States v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number><em>Halper </em>(1989), 490 U.S. 435, 447-48, 109 S.Ct. 1892, 1901-02, 104 L.Ed.2d 487).</p>\n<p id=\"b110-4\">Relying on the legislative history, the Department of Corrections asserts that the purpose of the supervision fee is to help defray the costs of probation and parole by charging those people benefitting from the system. The sponsor of the legislation stated that he was not attempting to introduce punitive legislation, rather, he was attempting to implement better community based programs for probationers and parolees.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-5\">The District Court determined that the \u201cintent of [the supervisory fee] is not to punish but to make the offender more responsible for his rehabilitation in the form of paying for supervision services rendered.\u201d In addition, the District Court aptly noted that \u201cthe purpose of Montana\u2019s imposition of probation and parole supervisory fees is to assist in making community corrections an effective alternative to incarceration through holding the offender accountable for his rehabilitation.\u201d We agree. The supervisory fee facilitates community corrections which serve, not as punishment, but as an alternative to imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-6\">Section 46-23-1031(l)(b), MCA, provides that the court or the board can \u201creduce or waive the fee or suspend the monthly payment of the fee if it determines that the payment would cause the probationer or parolee a significant financial hardship.\u201d The Department asserts that \u201c[i]f probationers and parolees fail to pay the fee, they have not been and will not be returned to [Montana State Prison].\u201d The Department concludes that \u201c[t]herefore, probationers and parolees should never experience financial hardship, nor parole revocation, solely as a result of a failure to pay the fee.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b110-7\">Under the supervision fee statute, Frazier is not being punished for his criminal activities, rather, he is helping to pay the costs of his supervision. A civil sanction will be deemed to be punishment in the constitutional sense only if the sanction \u201cmay not fairly be characterized as remedial, but <em>only </em>as a deterrent or retribution.\u201d <em>Bae, </em>44 F.3d at 493 <em>(citing Halper, </em>490 U.S. at 449, 109 S.Ct. at 1902). The legislative history of the supervision statute does not reveal an intent to punish. Further, we note that even if the supervision statute has a deterrent purpose that purpose does not automatically mark the statute as a form of punishment. <em>Bae, </em>44 F.3d at 494 (citing <em>Montana Department of Revenue v. Kurth Ranch </em>(1994), 511 U.S. 767, _, 114 S.Ct. 1937, 1946, 128 L.Ed.2d 767). The United States Supreme Court has consistently required \u201c \u2018unmistakable evidence of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>punitive intent\u2019 to characterize a sanction as punishment.\u201d <em>Bae, </em>44 F.3d at 494 (citing <em>Selective Serv. Sys. v. Minnesota Pub. Interest Research Group </em>(1984), 468 U.S. 841, 855 n.15, 104 S.Ct. 3348, 3357 n.15, 82 L.Ed.2d 632; <em>Flemming v. Nestor </em>(1960), 363 U.S. 603, 619, 80 S.Ct. 1367, 1377, 4 L.Ed.2d 1435). In the instant case, there is no such \u201cunmistakable evidence of punitive intent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b111-4\">The legislative intent of the supervision statute does not evidence an intent to punish, rather, the intent of the fee is to help defray the costs of supervision and to hold probationers and parolees accountable. These factors support our determination that the supervision fee is administrative as opposed to punitive in nature and cannot be fairly characterized as punishment. We hold, therefore, that the District Court was correct in concluding that the supervision fee set forth in \u00a7 46-23-1031, MCA, does not violate the prohibition against ex post facto laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b111-6\">CHIEF JUSTICE TURNAGE, JUSTICES NELSON, GRAY and ERDMANN concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b111-7\">JUSTICE TRIEWEILER</author>\n<p id=\"Apk\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-8\">I dissent from the majority opinion. I conclude that the supervision fee imposed on Craig William Frazier nearly seven years after the commission of his crime is indistinguishable from the additional restitution ordered in <em>State v. Leistiko </em>(1992), 256 Mont. 32, 844 P.2d 97, and that the same result is compelled by the reasoning in that case.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-9\">We held in <em>Leistiko </em>that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b111-10\">We use a two-part test to determine whether a statute violates the ban on <em>ex post facto </em>laws: (1) the law must be retrospective, and (2) it must disadvantage the offender affected by it. <em>Miller v. Florida </em>(1987), 482 U.S. 423, 430, 107 S.Ct. 2446, 2451, 96 L.Ed.2d 351, 360-61. A law is retrospective if it changes the legal consequences of actions committed before its effective date. <em>Miller, </em>482 U.S. at 430, 107 S.Ct. at 2451.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b111-11\"><em>Leistiko, </em>256 Mont. at 36-37, 844 P.2d at 100.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-12\">In <em>Leistiko </em>the district court ordered that the defendant pay additional restitution to his victim pursuant to a change in the law which occurred after his conviction. We held that the order requiring additional restitution violated the prohibition against <em>ex post facto </em>laws because it added $10,000 to the cost of his crime and placed an additional condition on his parole which could subject him to addi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>tional incarceration. <em>Leistiko, </em>256 Mont. at 37, 844 P.2d at 100. Both of those circumstances also exist in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-4\">The supervisory fee imposed on Frazier was retrospective because it changed the legal consequences of crimes he committed before the effective date of the fee. It disadvantaged Frazier because it increased the legal cost of his crime by an amount in excess of $5000. Furthermore, contrary to the representations of the Montana State Department of Corrections, which the majority opinion accepts at face value, Frazier was served with a notice by his probation and parole officer that if he did not pay the supervisory fee he could have his \u201cprobation/parole revoked.\u201d Therefore, both of the conditions which this Court found controlling in <em>Leistiko </em>exist in nearly the exact form in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-5\">The majority attempts to distinguish this case from <em>Leistiko </em>on the grounds that Frazier is not being punished by the supervisory fee, but is merely helping to pay the cost of his supervision. Neither was <em>Leistiko </em>being punished by the requirement that he pay restitution. He was merely helping to pay his victim for the consequences of his crime. In this case, the State is being reimbursed. In <em>Leistiko, </em>the victim was being reimbursed.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-6\">The majority opinion attributes some significance to the fact that it was not the Legislature\u2019s intent to punish those parolees who are required to pay thousands of dollars in supervision fees even though that requirement was not in existence at the time of their crimes. The Legislature\u2019s intent is not relevant to our constitutional analysis of whether \u00a7 46-23-1031(l)(a), MCA, violates Article II, Section 31, of the Montana Constitution, which prohibits <em>ex post facto </em>laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-7\">There is no practical basis on which to distinguish the facts in this case from the facts in <em>Leistiko. </em>There is no justification for refusing to apply the test for <em>ex post facto </em>laws which we have previously articulated to the facts in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-8\">For these reasons, I dissent from the majority opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b112-9\">JUSTICE HUNT joins in the foregoing dissenting opinion.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
