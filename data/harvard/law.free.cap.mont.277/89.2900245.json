We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-14\">The sole issue presented for review is:</p>\n<p id=\"b114-15\">Did the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court err in finding that Smart is not entitled to permanent total disability benefits under the Montana Occupational Disease Act?</p>\n<p id=\"b115-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b115-4\">Smart filed a claim on October 29, 1992, for an injury arising out of and in the course of his employment with the Montana Historical Society. Smart had been employed by the Montana Historical Society as an archival photographer for 11 years. As a result of overexposure to toxic chemicals used in the photography process, Smart experienced nausea, headaches, chronic respiratory irritation, disorientation, memory loss, and depression. At the time of his injury, Smart was earning $16 per hour, plus benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-5\">Smart\u2019s claim was accepted pursuant to the Montana Occupational Disease Act (MODA), set forth at Title 39, Chapter 72, Montana Code Annotated. The examining physician determined that Smart suffered from an occupational disease, but that the effects were not permanent so long as Smart did not continue his work in the darkroom.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-6\">The State Compensation Insurance Fund (the State Fund) paid Smart temporary total disability benefits. When Smart reached maximum medical improvement, the State Fund offered him $10,000, the maximum amount of benefits allowed under \u00a7 39-72-405, MCA (1991). Smart rejected the offer claiming that he is permanently totally disabled and is therefore entitled to benefits in excess of $10,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-7\">The State Fund, through Independent Rehabilitation Providers of Montana, performed an employability assessment on Smart to determine whether other employment was available according to his education and experience. The assessment determined that there were a number of positions available to Smart, all of which paid considerably less than the $16 per hour he had been making previously</p>\n<p id=\"b115-8\">On July 22, 1994, Smart filed a Motion for Summary Judgment with the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court claiming that the $10,000 limit in the MODA does not apply in his situation as he is permanently totally disabled. The court denied Smart\u2019s motion and certified the matter as final for purposes of appeal to the Montana Supreme Court. Smart filed an appeal with this Court on October 25, 1994. We dismissed the appeal, without prejudice, on April 20,1995, holding that the appeal was premature as the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court failed to decide the necessary substantive issues of claimant\u2019s benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-9\">On May 1,1995, Smart and the State Fund filed a joint Motion for Reconsideration before this Court. We denied this motion on May 9, 1995. On October 31,1995, the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court issued <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>a Decision and Final Judgment wherein the court ruled that Smart was not entitled to permanent total disability benefits under \u00a7 39-72-701(1), MCA (1991), and was limited to a maximum award of $10,000 pursuant to \u00a7 39-72-405, MCA (1991). Smart now appeals the Decision and Final Judgment of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-4\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b116-5\">Did the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court err in finding that Smart is not entitled to permanent total disability benefits under the Montana Occupational Disease Act?</p>\n<p id=\"b116-6\">The Workers\u2019 Compensation Court determined that, even though Smart cannot return to his former work, he is physically able to perform other available work for which he is qualified, thus he is not permanently totally disabled and not entitled to benefits under \u00a7 39-72-701(1), MCA (1991). The court found that compensation for Smart\u2019s injury is limited under the MODA, specifically by \u00a7 39-72-405, MCA (1991), to an award of up to $10,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-7\">We employ two standards of review for Workers\u2019 Compensation Court decisions: we review the court\u2019s findings of fact to determine if they are supported by substantial credible evidence, and we review the court\u2019s conclusions of law to determine if they are correct. <em>Turjan v. Valley View Estates </em>(1995), 272 Mont. 386, 390, 901 P.2d 76, 79 (citing <em>Caekaert v. State Comp. Mut. Ins. Fund </em>(1994), 268 Mont. 105, 110, 885 P.2d 495, 498). There are no contested facts in the case before us, only questions of statutory interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-8\">Smart argues that the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court erred in its interpretation of the MODA as it pertains to his injury. He maintains that \u00a7 39-72-405, MCA (1991), refers to a nondisabling occupational disease and that only when an individual has such a nondisabling occupational disease may compensation be limited to $10,000. Section 39-72-405, MCA (1991), provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b116-9\">(2) When any employee in employment on or after January 1, 1959, because he has an occupational disease incurred in and caused by such employment which is not yet disabling, is discharged or transferred from the employment in which he is engaged or when he ceases his employment and it is in fact, as determined by the medical panel, inadvisable for him on account of a nondisabling occupational disease to continue in employment and he suffers wage loss by reason of the discharge, transfer, or cessation, the department may allow compensation on account thereof as it considers just, not exceeding $10,000.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b117-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>Smart contends that this does not apply to him as his injury fits the definition of \u201cdisabling\u201d found at \u00a7 39-72-102, MCA (1991), which provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b117-3\">(4) \u201cDisablement\u201d means the event of becoming physically incapacitated by reason of an occupational disease from performing work in the worker\u2019s job pool.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b117-4\">Smart argues that his \u201cjob pool\u201d is photography and since he cannot return to work in that field, he is disabled under this definition. Smart does not claim that he is physically unable to perform other types of work. He agrees with the State Fund and the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court that he is only unable to perform photography work.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-5\">The State Fund, on the other hand, argues that the terms \u201cnot yet disabling\u201d and \u201cnondisabling\u201d in \u00a7 39-72-405, MCA (1991), mean that a person can have an occupational disease that prevents them from returning to their time of injury employment but does not prevent them from returning to other employment. As the State Fund points out, the \u201cnot yet disabling\u201d language in \u00a7 39-72-405, MCA, (1991), also takes into consideration the likelihood that an injured worker may become totally disabled at some time in the future, allowing for a change in status to permit payment of permanent total disability benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-6\">The State Fund contends, and we agree, that, only when a person is unable to physically perform any employment are they entitled to either temporary total disability benefits or permanent total disability benefits under the MODA. Smart does not fit within the definition of permanent total disability found in \u00a7 39-71-116(16), MCA, and made applicable to the MODA by \u00a7 39-72-701, MCA, because Smart is physically able to perform other types of employment. Section 39-71-116(16), MCA, provides in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b117-7\">(16) \u201cPermanent total disability\u201d means a condition resulting from injury as defined in this chapter, after a worker reaches maximum healing, in which a worker has no reasonable prospect of physically performing regular employment. Regular employment means work on a recurring basis performed for remuneration in a trade, business, profession, or other occupation in this state.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b117-8\">Contrary to Smart\u2019s contention that his \u201cjob pool\u201d includes only jobs in the field of photography, the State Fund argues that Smart\u2019s \u201cjob pool\u201d includes all jobs that he is physically capable of performing and that he is qualified for based on his age, education and experience. The phrase \u201cworker\u2019s job pool\u201d is not defined within the MODA, nor is it defined within the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act. In attempting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>to determine the meaning of this phrase, the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court, in its order denying Smart\u2019s Motion for Summary Judgment, looked to the plain meaning of the statute, but found that, on its face, the term has no plain, commonly understood meaning. The court found that the phrase is ambiguous and resorted to looking at the legislative history of the statute to determine the legislature\u2019s intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-4\">The only definition of \u201cworker\u2019s job pool\u201d that the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court was able to find was in a portion of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act that was repealed by the Montana Legislature in 1991. This statute provided, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b118-5\">(a) \u2018Worker\u2019s job pool\u201d means those jobs typically available for which a worker is qualified, consistent with the worker\u2019s age, education, vocational experience and aptitude and compatible with the worker\u2019s physical capacities and limitations as the result of the worker\u2019s injury. Lack of immediate job openings is not a factor to be considered.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b118-6\">(b) A worker\u2019s job pool may be either local or statewide, as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b118-7\">(i) a local job is one either in a central city that has within its economically integrated geographical area a population of less than 50,000 or in a city with a population of more than 50,000 as determined by the division; or</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b118-8\">(ii) a statewide job is one anywhere in the state of Montana. Section 39-71-1011(7), MCA (1987) (Repealed).</p>\n<p id=\"b118-9\">In its denial of Smart\u2019s Motion for Summary Judgment, the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court adopted this definition of \u201cworker\u2019s job pool.\u201d Smart contends that the court erred in applying this definition as the definition had been repealed in 1991. He argues that the MODA should be applied in a manner most favorable to the injured worker. In support of this proposition, Smart relies on \u00a7 39-72-104, MCA (1985) (Repealed) (requiring liberal construction in the interpretation of any part of this chapter).</p>\n<p id=\"b118-10\">Ordinarily, legislative intent can be gleaned from the plain meaning of the statute. <em>Holly Sugar v. Department of Revenue </em>(1992), 252 Mont. 407, 412, 830 P.2d 76, 79.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b118-11\">If the language is clear and unambiguous, no further interpretation is required, and we will resort to legislative history only if legislative intent cannot be determined from the plain wording of the statute.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b119-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number><em>Clarke v. Massey </em>(1995), 271 Mont. 412, 416, 897 P.2d 1085, 1088 (citing <em>Lovell v. State Comp. Mut. Ins. Fund </em>(1993), 260 Mont. 279, 285, 860 P.2d 95, 99).</p>\n<p id=\"b119-4\">The term \u201cworker\u2019s job pool\u201d was inserted into both the Workers Compensation Act and the MODA during the 1987 Montana legislative session. In addition, the 1987 Legislature added the definition of \u201cworker\u2019s job pool\u201d to the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act. We agree with the State Fund and the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court that the legislature intended that the same definition apply to both acts since the legislature did not construct a different definition of \u201cworker\u2019s job pool\u201d for the MODA.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-5\">In 1991, the Montana Legislature adopted new standards for rehabilitation in the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, repealing the standards set forth in 1987. Along with the elimination of the term \u201cworker\u2019s job pool\u201d in the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, the 1991 Legislature repealed the definition of that term found in the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, but did not eliminate the term from the MODA. Repeal of the definition of \u201cworker\u2019s job pool\u201d from the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act does not mean that any other definition was ever intended for this term by the legislature. It is reasonable, as the State Fund and the Workers\u2019 Compensation Corut surmised, that the definition would remain the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-6\">Since the legislature\u2019s intention in using the phrase \u201cworker\u2019s job pool\u201d cannot be determined from the plain meaning of that phrase, we find no error in the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court resorting to legislative history and adopting the definition of this phrase set out at \u00a7 39-71-1011(7), MCA(1987) (Repealed). In addition, we do not find persuasive Smart\u2019s contention that the MODA should be applied in a manner most favorable to the injured worker as the statute Smart cites for this proposition was repealed by the 1987 Montana Legislature at the same time the phrase \u201cworker\u2019s job pool\u201d was inserted into the MODA and the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-7\">Accordingly, we hold that the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court was correct in concluding that Smart is not entitled to permanent total disability benefits under the MODA since he is physically able to perform other types of employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-8\">Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b119-9\">JUSTICES TRIEWEILER, GRAY, HUNT and LEAPHART concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
