We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-9\">We restate the issues on appeal as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b287-10\">1. Did the District Court err in concluding that \u00a7 46-11-504(1), MCA, does not bar prosecution of the drug charge?</p>\n<p id=\"b287-11\">2. Did the District Court err in concluding that \u00a7 45-9-102, MCA, does not deny Tadewaldt equal protection of the laws or constitute cruel and unusual punishment?</p>\n<p id=\"b287-12\">Tadewaldt was arrested for driving under the influence of alcohol and/or drugs (DUI) on August 10,1994. Several months later, he pled guilty to that misdemeanor charge in Missoula Municipal Court. The Municipal Court fined Tadewaldt $350, required him to complete the Montana ACT program and suspended the entirety of a ten-day jail sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-13\">Immediately following Tadewaldt\u2019s arrest for the DUI offense, several pills were found in his possession which later were identified as Schedule III and IV drugs under \u00a7 50-32-101, MCA. On August 22, 1994, the State of Montana (State) charged Tadewaldt in the District Court with criminal possession of dangerous drugs, a felony offense, in violation of \u00a7 45-9-102, MCA. Tadewaldt pled not guilty to the criminal possession charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>After judgment was entered on the DUI charge in Municipal Court, Tadewaldt moved the District Court to dismiss the criminal possession of dangerous drugs charge. He contended that that offense arose out of the same transaction as the DUI and, as a result, \u00a7 40-11-504, MCA, barred the subsequent prosecution. The court denied Tadewaldt\u2019s motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-4\">Tadewaldt later filed a second motion to dismiss the criminal possession of dangerous drugs charge. He argued that \u00a7 45-9-102, MCA, denies him equal protection of the laws and constitutes cruel and unusual punishment because it does not provide for a lesser included or misdemeanor offense for possession of a small amount of drugs. The District Court denied Tadewaldt\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">Tadewaldt subsequently withdrew his not guilty plea and pled guilty to the charge of criminal possession of dangerous drugs, reserving his right to appeal the denial of his motions to dismiss. Thereafter, the District Court entered judgment and deferred imposition of sentence for two years subject to specified terms and conditions. Tadewaldt appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-6\">1. Did the District Court err in concluding that \u00a7 46-11-504(1), MCA, does not bar prosecution of the drug charge?</p>\n<p id=\"b288-7\">In his first motion to dismiss the criminal possession of dangerous drugs charge, Tadewaldt argued that \u00a7 46-11-504(1), MCA, bars prosecution for that offense. Section 46-11-504, MCA, provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b288-8\">When conduct constitutes an offense within the concurrent jurisdiction ... of two courts of separate, overlapping, or concurrent jurisdiction in this state, a prosecution in any other jurisdiction is a bar to a subsequent prosecution in this state under the same circumstances barring further prosecution in this state if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b288-9\">(1) the first prosecution resulted in an acquittal or in a conviction and the subsequent prosecution is based on an offense arising out of the same transaction ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b288-10\">Thus, a subsequent prosecution is barred under this statute, by its terms, if the following three factors are met: (1) a defendant\u2019s conduct constitutes an offense within the jurisdiction of the court where the first prosecution occurred and within the jurisdiction of the court where the subsequent prosecution is pursued; (2) the first prosecution results in an acquittal or a conviction; and (3) the subsequent prosecution is based on an offense arising out of the same transaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>Neither Tadewaldt nor the State disputes that the second \u00a7 46-11-504(1), MCA, factor is met here. The first prosecution resulted in Tadewaldfs guilty plea in the Municipal Court on the DUI charge and imposition of sentence thereon and, under \u00a7 46-1-202(6), MCA, a judgment or sentence entered on a guilty plea constitutes a conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-4\">The District Court concluded that neither of the two remaining \u00a7 46-11-504(1), MCA, factors is met in this case. On that basis, the court concluded that \u00a7 46-11-504(1), MCA, does not bar the subsequent prosecution for criminal possession of dangerous drugs. We review a district court\u2019s conclusions of law to determine whether the court\u2019s interpretation of the law is correct. <em>State v. Gould </em>(1995), 273 Mont. 207, 219, 902 P.2d 532, 540.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">We begin by considering whether, under the language contained in \u00a7 46-11-504(1), MCA, the subsequent prosecution of Tadewaldt on the drug charge \u201cis based on an offense arising out of the same transaction\u201d as the DUI prosecution. Insofar as it is relevant here, \u201csame transaction\u201d is statutorily defined as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b289-6\">conduct consisting of a series of acts or omissions that are motivated by:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b289-7\">(a) a purpose to accomplish a criminal objective and that are necessary or incidental to the accomplishment of that objective ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AHg\">Section 46-1-202(22), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-8\">We have interpreted the \u201csame transaction\u201d factor contained in \u00a7 46-11-504, MCA, and its predecessor, \u00a7 95-1711(4), R.C.M. (1947), on numerous occasions. <em>See, e.g., State v. Sword </em>(1987), 229 Mont. 370, 747 P.2d 206; <em>State v. Houser </em>(1981), 192 Mont. 164, 626 P.2d 256; <em>State v. Zimmerman </em>(1977), 175 Mont. 179, 573 P.2d 174. In all three of the foregoing cases, we interpreted that factor according to the statutory definition of \u201csame transaction.\u201d <em>See Sword, </em>747 P.2d at 208; <em>Houser, </em>626 P.2d at 258; <em>Zimmerman, </em>573 P.2d at 179. The statutory definition of \u201csame transaction\u201d applied in those cases has remained constant and, indeed, was identical to the current definition contained in \u00a7 46-1-202(22), MCA. <em>Compare </em>\u00a7 46-1-202(22), MCA, <em>with </em>\u00a7\u00a7 46-11-501(1)(a), MCA (1987) (applied in <em>Sword, </em>747 P.2d at 208); 46-11-501(1)(a), MCA (1979) (applied in <em>Houser, </em>626 P.2d at 258); and 95-1711(1)(a), R.C.M. (1947) (applied in <em>Zimmerman, </em>573 P.2d at 179).</p>\n<p id=\"b289-9\"><em>In Sword, </em>the most recent of our cases interpreting the \u00a7 46-11-504, MCA, \u201csame transaction\u201d factor, the defendant was charged in the United States District Court for the District of Montana with violat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>ing the Endangered Species Act of 1973, pled guilty to the offense and was sentenced. <em>Sword, </em>747 P.2d at 207. Thereafter, the defendant was charged in Montana justice court with violating \u00a7 87-2-106(5), MCA (1985), for making false statements on his application for a grizzly bear trophy license and was convicted. <em>Sword, </em>747 P.2d at 207. On appeal by the defendant to the Montana district court, the court concluded that the second prosecution was barred and granted the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss. <em>Sword, 747 </em>P.2d at 207.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-4\">On appeal to this Court, we observed that the defendant\u2019s conduct consisted of \u201cpossessing, carrying, and transporting of a bear taken unlawfully,\u201d and noted his guilty plea based on that conduct to the Endangered Species Act charge in federal court. The trophy license\u2014 which the defendant obtained by making false statements on his application \u2014 authorized him to possess and transport the bear. <em>Sword, </em>747 P.2d at 208-209. Applying the \u201csame transaction\u201d definition contained in \u00a7 46-11-501(1)(a), MCA (1987), to the defendant\u2019s conduct, we concluded that the false statements which formed the basis for the state charge were \u201cmotivated and necessary or at least incidental to the accomplishment of the criminal objective of possessing, carrying, and transporting of a grizzly bear taken unlawfully\u201d for which he was convicted in the federal court. <em>Sword, </em>747 P.2d at 209. Thus, because the defendant\u2019s conduct fell within the purview of the statutory definition of \u201csame transaction,\u201d we held that the subsequent prosecution in state court was based on an offense arising out of the same transaction as the federal prosecution within the meaning of \u00a7 46-11-504, MCA. <em>Sword, 747 </em>P.2d at 209.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">Applying <em>Sword </em>to Tadewaldt\u2019s conduct mandates a result opposite from that reached in <em>Sword. </em>Here, Tadewaldt ingested an unidentified substance and drove a vehicle while under the influence of that substance; he also possessed Schedule III and IV drugs. Tadewaldt was not charged in the District Court with criminal possession of the unidentified substance he had already ingested and which resulted in the DUI charge and conviction in the Municipal Court. The criminal possession of dangerous drugs charge was based on Schedule III and IV drugs in his possession subsequent to his arrest for DUI.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-6\">In <em>Sword, </em>the defendant\u2019s conduct underlying the subsequent prosecution in state court, namely, making false statements on a grizzly bear trophy license application, enabled him to possess and transport a grizzly bear, for which he was convicted in federal court; thus, the defendant\u2019s conduct in procuring the license through false statements clearly was motivated by a purpose to accomplish the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>criminal objective of possessing and transporting a grizzly bear and was necessary or incidental to that objective. In the present case, however, the opposite is true. The conduct underlying Tadewaldt\u2019s \u201ccriminal objective\u201d of DUI \u2014 ingesting an unidentified substance and driving a vehicle while under the influence of that substance \u2014 is unrelated to his possession of dangerous drugs. Tadewaldt had completed his \u201ccriminal objective\u201d of DUI and, later, Schedule III and IV drugs were found in his possession. The drugs forming the basis of the criminal possession charge had not been ingested and did not contribute to Tadewaldt\u2019s impairment. Thus, in statutory terms, Tadewaldt\u2019s conduct in possessing the dangerous drugs was not motivated by a purpose to accomplish the \u201ccriminal objective\u201d of DUI, nor was it necessary or incidental to that \u201cobjective.\u201d We conclude that Tadewaldt\u2019s conduct does not meet the definition of \u201csame transaction\u201d contained in \u00a7 46-1-202(22), MCA, and, therefore, the criminal possession of dangerous drugs charge does not arise out of the same transaction as the DUI charge within the meaning of \u00a7 46-11-504(1), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-4\">As set forth above, \u00a7 46-11-504(1), MCA, is written in the conjunctive; as a result, all three factors must be met before a subsequent prosecution is barred. <em>See </em>\u00a7 46-11-504(1), MCA; <em>State v. Miller </em>(1988), 231 Mont. 497, 517, 757 P.2d 1275, 1288. Based on our conclusion that the \u201csame transaction\u201d factor is not met here, we need not address the \u201cjurisdiction\u201d factor contained in \u00a7 46-11-504, MCA. Nevertheless, we reiterate here the concern we expressed in <em>Sword </em>over the somewhat unclear \u201cconcurrent jurisdiction\u201d portion of \u00a7 46-11-504, MCA, and, again, invite the legislature to more clearly evidence its intent with regard to this part of the statute. <em>See Sword, </em>747 P.2d at 210.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">As a final matter in this regard, we observe that our cases interpreting the \u201csame transaction\u201d factor in \u00a7 46-11-504(1), MCA, are not entirely consistent. We cited above to <em>Sword, Houser, </em>and <em>Zimmerman, </em>wherein we interpreted the \u201csame transaction\u201d factor in \u00a7 46-11-504(1), MCA, by applying the statutory definition of \u201csame transaction;\u201d those cases were decided in 1987, 1981, and 1977, respectively. After deciding <em>Zimmerman </em>and <em>Houser, </em>but before <em>Sword, </em>we decided <em>State v. Pierce </em>(1982), 199 Mont. 57, 647 P.2d 847, and departed from that approach. In order to avoid confusion in future cases, we take this opportunity to revisit <em>Pierce.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b291-6\"><em>In Pierce, </em>the defendant was charged with DUI injustice court and pled guilty. Several days later, the defendant was charged in district court with two counts of aggravated assault and one count of failure <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>to stop at the scene of an accident. He pled guilty to the failure to stop charge, went to trial on the aggravated assault charges and was convicted. <em>Pierce, </em>647 P.2d at 848-49. The defendant argued on appeal that \u201ca charge of aggravated assault would violate his constitutional right against being placed in double jeopardy as he had already pled guilty to another charge arising from the same accident, driving under the influence of alcohol.\u201d <em>Pierce, </em>647 P.2d at 850. He apparently did not raise the issue in terms of the statutory bar contained in \u00a7 46-11-504, MCA. <em>See Pierce, </em>647 P.2d at 849-50.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-4\">We set forth \u00a7 46-11-504(1), MCA, as the \u201capplicable codification of defendant\u2019s constitutional right against being placed in double jeopardy\u2019 and interpreted the \u201csame transaction\u201d language of the statute under <em>Blockburger v. United States </em>(1932), 284 U.S. 299, 52 S.Ct. 180, 76 L.Ed. 306, the traditional double jeopardy test. <em>See Pierce, </em>647 P.2d at 850. Applying <em>Blockburger, </em>we evaluated the elements of the offenses with which the defendant was charged and concluded that assault and DUI each require proof of an element the other does not. <em>Pierce, </em>647 P.2d at 850. On that basis, we held that the defendant\u2019s constitutional right against being placed in double jeopardy was not violated. <em>Pierce, </em>647 P.2d at 850. While it is not altogether clear why we failed to interpret the \u201csame transaction\u201d factor in \u00a7 46-11-504, MCA, by applying the statutory definition of that term, as we previously had done in <em>Houser </em>and <em>Zimmerman, </em>it appears that the defendant\u2019s framing of the issue in double jeopardy terms pointed us to the traditional <em>Blockburger </em>analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">We stated in <em>Sword, </em>and reaffirm here, that \u00a7 46-11-504(1), MCA, affords criminal defendants greater protection from double jeopardy than is provided under <em>Blockburger, </em>indeed, we aptly noted in <em>Sword </em>that application of <em>Blockburger </em>in \u00a7 46-11-504(1), MCA, cases would strip the defendant of the protection granted under that statute. <em>Sword, </em>747 P.2d at 209. While the <em>Blockburger </em>\u201celements\u201d test generally is appropriate in analyzing double jeopardy arguments relating to whether there are two offenses or only one <em>(see Sword, </em>747 P.2d at 209), the plain language of \u00a7 46-11-504(1), MCA, mandates a broader conduct- and transaction-based analysis than <em>Blockburger </em>provides.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">As discussed above, we properly interpreted \u00a7 46-11-504(1), MCA, in <em>Sword </em>\u2014 consistent with our <em>pre-Pierce </em>cases and the statute \u2014 by applying the statutory definition of \u201csame transaction.\u201d Unfortunately, we distinguished <em>Pierce </em>in <em>Sword </em>based only on the \u201cconcurrent jurisdiction\u201d portion of \u00a7 46-11-504, MCA, without noting the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>inconsistency between <em>Pierce, </em>on the one hand, and <em>Houser </em>and <em>Zimmerman, </em>on the other, with regard to the \u201csame transaction\u201d factor. <em>See Sword, </em>747 P.2d at 209.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-4\">To resolve any confusion, we state clearly here that the <em>Blockburger </em>test is inapplicable in analyzing the \u201csame transaction\u201d factor contained in \u00a7 46-11-504(1), MCA. <em>See Sword, 747 </em>P.2d at 209. In interpreting that factor, courts must apply the statutory definition of \u201csame transaction.\u201d Accordingly, we overrule <em>Pierce </em>to the extent it indicates that \u00a7 46-11-504(1), MCA, is properly analyzed under <em>Block-burger.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">We concluded above that Tadewaldt\u2019s conduct underlying the DUI and drug charges did not arise from the same transaction and, therefore, that the \u201csame transaction\u201d factor contained in \u00a7 46-11-504(1), MCA, is not met here. We hold, therefore, that the District Court correctly concluded that \u00a7 46-11-504(1), MCA, does not bar the prosecution for criminal possession of dangerous drugs in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"A_B\">2. Did the District Court err in concluding that \u00a7 45-9-102, MCA, does not deny Tadewaldt equal protection of the laws or constitute cruel and unusual punishment?</p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">Tadewaldt\u2019s second motion to dismiss challenged the constitutionality of \u00a7 45-9-102(5), MCA, based on equal protection and cruel and unusual punishment grounds. Both constitutional challenges were premised on the absence in \u00a7 45-9-102(5), MCA, of a \u201cdistinction in punishment [for] varying quantities of the same drug....\u201d The District Court concluded that \u00a7 45-9-102, MCA, did not deny Tadewaldt equal protection of the laws or constitute cruel and unusual punishment and, on that basis, denied Tadewaldt\u2019s motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-7\">At the outset, we restate the well-established principle that \u201c[a] legislative enactment is presumed to be constitutional and will be upheld on review except when proven to be unconstitutional beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>State v. Lilburn </em>(1994), 265 Mont. 258, 262, 875 P.2d 1036, 1039 (citing <em>City of Billings v. Laedeke </em>(1991), 247 Mont. 151, 154, 805 P.2d 1348, 1349). The party attacking a statute as unconstitutional bears a significant burden in proving its invalidity. <em>In re Matter of Wood </em>(1989), 236 Mont. 118, 122, 768 P.2d 1370, 1373 (citing <em>T &amp; W Chevrolet v. Darvial </em>(1982), 196 Mont. 287, 292, 641 P.2d 1368, 1370).</p>\n<p id=\"b293-8\">\n<em>Equal Protection</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b293-9\">Tadewaldt\u2019s equal protection argument is premised on the failure of \u00a7 45-9-102, MCA, to provide for different degrees of culpa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>bility and sentencing based on the quantity of Schedule III and IV drugs in a defendant\u2019s possession. He states that \u201cthe bulk of criminal offenses in Montana recognize differing degrees of culpability in their application and appropriately provide for varying levels of punishment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b294-4\">Tadewaldt\u2019s somewhat murky equal protection argument notwithstanding, it is clear that it is within the province of the legislature to distinguish between criminal offenses and to set punishments. <em>State v. Bruns </em>(1984), 213 Mont. 372, 378, 691 P.2d 817, 821 (citing <em>Gore v. United States </em>(1958), 357 U.S. 386, 393, 78 S.Ct. 1280, 1285, 2 L.Ed.2d 1405, 1410-11). A defendant\u2019s constitutional right to equal protection of the laws is not violated unless the defendant is treated differently based on an impermissible classification. <em>See Bruns, </em>691 P.2d at 821. If everyone in the same class is treated equally, there is no violation of equal protection. <em>State ex rel. Zander v. District Court </em>(1979), 180 Mont. 548, 556-57, 591 P.2d 656, 661 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">With exceptions not at issue here, all persons in possession of statutorily-defined dangerous drugs commit the offense of criminal possession of dangerous drugs defined in \u00a7 45-9-102, MCA, and are subject to the sentences set forth therein. Thus, as was the case in <em>State ex rel. Zander, </em>\u201c[h]ere there is but one class and all persons within that class are treated equally satisfying constitutional equal protection requirements.\u201d <em>See State ex rel. Zander, </em>591 P.2d at 661. Absent any classification in \u00a7 45-9-102(5), MCA, no impermissible classification exists as a matter of law. Accordingly, we hold that the District Court did not err in concluding that \u00a7 45-9-102(5), MCA, does not deny Tadewaldt equal protection of the laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">\n<em>Cruel and Unusual Punishment</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b294-7\">Section 45-9-102(5), MCA, provides that \u201c[a] person convicted of criminal possession of dangerous drugs ... shall be imprisoned in the state prison for a term not to exceed 5 years or be fined an amount not to exceed $50,000, or both.\u201d Pursuant to \u00a7 45-9-102(6), MCA, \u201c[a] person of the age of 21 years or under convicted of a first violation under this section is presumed to be entitled to a deferred imposition of sentence of imprisonment.\u201d The District Court deferred imposition of Tadewaldt\u2019s sentence for two years, subject to stated terms and conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-8\">Both the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Article II, Section 22 of the Montana Constitution prohibit cruel and unusual punishment. We consistently have held, however, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>a sentence which falls within the statutory maximum is not cruel and unusual punishment. <em>See, e.g., State v. DeSalvo </em>(1995), 273 Mont. 343, 350, 903 P.2d 202, 206-207; <em>Bruns, </em>691 P.2d at 820. Tadewaldt\u2019s sentence was substantially less severe than the statutory maximum and, under the general rule referenced above, it does not constitute cruel and unusual punishment. <em>See Bruns, </em>691 P.2d at 820.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-4\">An exception to this general rule exists, however. When a sentence is so disproportionate to the crime that it shocks the conscience and outrages the moral sense of the community or of justice, it constitutes cruel and unusual punishment. <em>Bruns, </em>691 P.2d at 820 (citation omitted). A defendant has the burden of proving that the sentence he received falls within this exception. <em>Bruns, </em>691 P.2d at 820.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">Tadewaldt argues that \u201c[a] mandatory felony for a college kid in possession of such a small quantity of a Schedule IV drug is cruel and unusual punishment...\u201d but concedes on appeal that he received the most lenient sentence possible under the statute. Furthermore, if Tadewaldt adheres to the terms and conditions of his deferred sentence, he can avoid having a permanent felony record. <em>See </em>\u00a7 46-18-204, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-6\">On this record, Tadewaldt\u2019s bare assertion of cruel and unusual punishment falls far short of meeting his burden of proving that his sentence is so disproportionate to the crime that it outrages the moral sense of the community or of justice. Accordingly, we hold that the District Court did not err in concluding that Tadewaldt\u2019s sentence does not constitute cruel and unusual punishment.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b295-8\">CHIEF JUSTICE TURNAGE, JUSTICES ERDMANN, NELSON and LEAPHART concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
