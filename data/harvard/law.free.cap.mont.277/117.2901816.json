In 1990, Poteat filed a petition for a hearing before the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court, asserting that St. Paul, the hospital\u2019s insurer, refused to pay her claim. In 1992, the parties entered into a full and final compromise settlement agreement. By the terms of that agreement, Poteat accepted a lump sum payment but specifically reserved \u201cfuture medical and hospital benefits.\u201d Sub<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>ject to that reservation, Poteat accepted the lump sum and released St. Paul \u201cfrom all further obligations for compensation benefits for this injury under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b143-4\">In 1993, Poteat filed suit in the District Court against St. Paul alleging various illegal trade practices. Specifically, Poteat alleged that St. Paul had committed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-5\">Count One: unfair trade practices prior to the settlement agreement;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-6\">Count Two: breach of the settlement agreement;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-7\">Count Three: unfair trade practices subsequent to the settlement agreement; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-8\">Count Four: actual malice, arising from St. Paul\u2019s alleged refusal to pay medical and pharmaceutical expenses.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b143-9\">St. Paul moved to dismiss the complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, and the District Court granted the motion. In its order, the District Court noted that a complainant is statutorily prohibited from filing an UTPAsuit against an insurer until after the underlying claim has been settled or adjudicated. Since Poteat had expressly reserved medical benefits, the District Court concluded that the settlement agreement was not a final settlement of the underlying claim. The District Court determined that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction to consider Poteat\u2019s unfair trade practices claims until the underlying claim had been adjudicated by the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court or settled entirely, including fixture medical benefits. It accordingly granted St. Paxxl\u2019s motion to dismiss Poteat\u2019s suit. Poteat appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-10\">Did the District Court err by granting St. Paul\u2019s motion to dismiss Poteat\u2019s claim for lack of subject matter jurisdiction?</p>\n<p id=\"b143-11\">When deciding a motion to dismiss based on lack of subject matter jurisdiction, a district coxirt must determine whether the complaint states facts that, if true, would vest the district court with subject matter jurisdiction. <em>Barthule v. Karman </em>(1994), 268 Mont. 477, 483, 886 P.2d 971, 975 (citing <em>Stanley v. Holms </em>(1994), 267 Mont. 316, 883 P.2d 837). This conclusion is a question of law, and we will review to determine whether the District Court\u2019s interpretation of the law is correct. Barthule, 886 P.2d at 975 (citing <em>In re Marriage of Barnard </em>(1994), 264 Mont. 103, 870 P.2d 91).</p>\n<p id=\"b143-12\">The parties agree that Poteat brought her District Court complaint alleging unfair trade practices, breach of contract, and actual malice under the Montana Unfair Trade Practices Act (UTPA), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>\u00a7 33-18-242, MCA. While the UTPA authorizes such suits, it specifically states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b144-4\">A third-party claimant may not file an action under this section until after the underlying claim has been settled or a judgment entered in favor of the claimant on the underlying claim.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b144-7\">Section 33-18-242(6)(b), MCA. St. Paul argued, and the District Court agreed, that the settlement agreement in this case did not serve to settle the entire underlying claim because future medical benefits were reserved. Since the underlying claim involved workers\u2019 compensation, and since, pursuant to \u00a7 39-71-2905, MCA, the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court has exclusive jurisdiction over workers\u2019 compensation claims, the District Court determined that it had no jurisdiction to hear a UTPA case unless and until Poteat obtained a judgment or settlement of the <em>entire </em>underlying claim from the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-8\">This conclusion, however, ignores the District Court\u2019s power to sever claims over which it has no jurisdiction, dismiss them, and proceed with those over which it does. Rule 42(b), M.R.Civ.P. Affirmative defenses such as lack of jurisdiction often may present grounds for severance or bifurcation in a multi-claim suit. <em>Britton v. Farmers Ins. Group </em>(1986), 221 Mont. 67, 95, 721 P.2d 303, 321.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-9\">The order approving the full and final settlement agreement specified that \u201c[fiurther medical and hospital benefits have been reserved by the claimant.\u201d Later, the order states more specifically that \u201c[fluture medical and hospital benefits have been reserved.\u201d By its terms, the \u201cfull and final compromise settlement\u201d encompasses everything <em>except </em>future medical benefits. The rest of Poteat\u2019s claims \u2014 compensation and past medical benefits \u2014 were settled and the parties were bound to abide by the terms of the ftdl and final settlement.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-10\">In contrast, Poteat\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation claim to <em>future </em>medical benefits was specifically exempted from settlement and remains unresolved. Since the underlying claim must be settled or adjudicated before a party is permitted to bring an independent action under UTPA, Poteat cannot proceed with any claim which encompasses unfair trade practices committed <em>after </em>settlement unless or until she obtains a judgment or settlement of the unresolved future medical benefits from the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court. Until such time, the District Court correctly determined that it did not have subject matter jurisdiction over such a claim. However, Poteat\u2019s underlying workers\u2019 compensation claims for compensation and <em>past </em>medical <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>benefits have been fully settled. Those counts of her suit which encompass unfair trade practices committed <em>before </em>settlement have their basis in a valid existing settlement agreement. Since an underlying settlement is in place as mandated by \u00a7 33-18-242(6)(b), MCA, Poteat may legitimately pursue a UTPA claim in the District Court regarding pre-settlement unfair trade practices.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-4\">Counts one and four of Poteat\u2019s suit allege actual malice and unfair trade practices <em>before </em>the settlement agreement. These allegations are not based on an underlying claim which has not been settled or adjudicated. In contrast, counts two and three allege breach of contract and unfair trade practices <em>after </em>the settlement agreement. These counts concern the issue of future medical benefits, which is a matter not yet settled by the parties nor adjudicated by the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court. Poteat may not proceed with an independent action under UTPA asserting the claims contained in counts two and three until the underlying claim for future medicals is resolved.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-5\">The District Court\u2019s determination that it did not have subject matter jurisdiction over counts two and three is affirmed. The District Court\u2019s determination that it did not have subject matter jurisdiction over counts one and four is reversed, and this case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b145-6\">CHIEF JUSTICE TURNAGE, JUSTICES GRAY, LEAPHART and ERDMANN concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
