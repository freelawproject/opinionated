The District Court denied Burchett\u2019s motion to suppress. Burchett pled guilty to the offense charged and reserved his right to appeal the denial of his motion to suppress. The District Court sentenced Burchett to a term of five years under the custody and supervision of the Department of Corrections. Burchett appeals the District Court\u2019s denial of his motion to suppress. We affirm the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-9\">The issue on appeal is whether the District Court erred when it denied Burchett\u2019s motion to suppress evidence seized during a probation search.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-10\">FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b217-11\">In 1994, Joseph Burchett pled guilty to felony assault. As a result of that plea, he was sentenced to two consecutive two-year terms. That sentence was suspended; however, Burchett was placed on probation pursuant to the rules and regulations of the State Department of Probation and Parole. Among other requirements, the rules provide that: \u201cThe probationer/parolee shall not own, possess or be in control of any firearm, including black powder, or deadly weapon as so defined by state or federal statute.\u201d Rule 20.7.1101(5), ARM. The rules also provide that: \u201cUpon reasonable cause, the probation or parole client shall submit to a search of their person, vehicle or residence by a probation/parole officer at any time without a warrant.\u201d Rule 20.7.1101(7), ARM.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>Burchett was an employee of Billings Crown Parts, a store dealing in mining equipment parts and supply, from 1990 through 1994. During his employment with Crown Parts, Burchett possessed a key to the store. In August 1994, Crown Parts terminated Burchett after several unexcused absences.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-4\">During the Thanksgiving holiday in 1994, Crown Parts was burglarized. Many items, including unique tools, were stolen from a new storage room. Law enforcement suspected an \u201cinside job\u201d because there was no sign of forced entry and the store employees recalled locking the building at closing time.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">On December 1, 1994, Crown Parts\u2019 manager contacted law enforcement authorities and told them that he suspected Burchett and another employee as the person or persons who may have been the burglars because of their recent discharges and the fact that the burglary appeared to be an \u201cinside job.\u201d Law enforcement did not make a search or arrest at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-6\">On January 17, 1995, Crown Parts\u2019 manager summoned Deputy Frank Dostal to Crown Parts. He informed Dostal that one of his employees had been to Burchett\u2019s home on January 12,1995, and had observed not only the stolen parts, but also a large cache of firearms. The employee reported this information to the manager, but had insisted on remaining anonymous because he feared reprisal from Burchett.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-7\">Upon receipt of this information, Dostal immediately contacted Detective Hirschi of the Yellowstone County Sheriff\u2019s Department. Detective Hirschi recalled that Burchett was on probation and contacted Probation and Parole Officer Steven Hurd of the Department of Corrections. Hurd, who remembered that Burchett\u2019s prior two convictions had involved firearms, immediately organized a search of Burchett\u2019s home. Probation and Parole Officer Pam Bunke, Detective Hirschi, and Detective Ron Armstrong of the sheriff\u2019s department assisted Hurd in the search.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-8\">Once at Burchett\u2019s home, Hurd knocked on the door, entered, and told Burchett he was conducting a \u201cparole search.\u201d The other officers followed Hurd inside and Detective Hirschi secured the premises. In the basement of Burchett\u2019s home, Hurd, Bunke, and Armstrong discovered a large cache of military-type weapons and explosives. Although the weapons looked authentic, they were later discovered to be antique BB guns, \u201cdummy\u2019 weapons, and explosives.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-9\">Upon discovery of the weapons, Hurd summoned Detective Hirschi to the basement. As he walked through the kitchen on his way to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>basement, Hirschi discovered a boring bar and tool head, which he believed matched a description of the some of the tools missing from Crown Parts. After examining the weapons in the basement, Hirschi obtained Burchett\u2019s consent to search the premises. During the search, Hirschi discovered numerous items taken from Crown Parts. After Officer Hurd arrested Burchett for violation of his probation and Detective Hirschi gave Burchett <em>Miranda </em>warnings, Burchett admitted to stealing the Crown Parts\u2019 items found in his possession.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-4\">On January 25, 1995, the Yellowstone County Attorney charged Burchett in the Thirteenth Judicial District Court with the offense of burglary. Burchett moved the District Court to suppress the seized weapons and tools because he maintained that the probation search conducted by Hurd violated his rights against unreasonable search and seizure pursuant to the United States and Montana Constitutions. The District Court denied Burchett\u2019s motion on June 6,1995.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b219-6\">Did the District Court err when it denied Burchett\u2019s motion to suppress evidence seized during a probation search?</p>\n<p id=\"b219-7\">We review a district court\u2019s denial of a motion to suppress to determine whether the court\u2019s findings of fact are clearly erroneous and whether those findings were correctly applied as a matter of law. <em>State v. Williams </em>(1995), 273 Mont. 459, 462, 904 P.2d 1019, 1021.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-8\">In this case, the facts are undisputed. Prior to the District Court\u2019s ruling on Burchett\u2019s motion to suppress, the Deputy Yellowstone County Attorney and Burchett\u2019s attomeyjointly submitted stipulated facts. Based on those stipulated facts, the District Court denied Burchett\u2019s motion to suppress. The court concluded that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b219-9\">Parole Officer Steven Hurd, after being advised by Detective Hirschi of the report that [Burchett] had a large cash [sic] of weapons in his residence had reasonable cause to conduct a search of his residence to ascertain whether or not the conditions of his parole were being violated and the warrantless search conducted by Officer Hurd with the assistance of the other officers did not violate his right, protected by either the United States Constitution or the Montana Constitution to be secure in his home against unreasonable search and seizure.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b219-10\">It is well established that a probation officer may search a probationer\u2019s residence without a warrant as long as the officer has reasonable cause for the search. Rule 20.7.1101(7), ARM; <em>State v. Burke </em>(1988), 235 Mont. 165, 169, 766 P.2d 254, 256. The \u201creasonable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>cause\u201d standard is substantially less than the probable cause standard required by the Fourth Amendment because of the probationer\u2019s diminished expectation of privacy and because the probation officer is in the best position to determine what level of supervision is necessary to provide both rehabilitation of the probationer and safety for society. Burke, 235 Mont. at 169, 171, 766 P.2d at 256, 257 (citing <em>Griffin v. Wisconsin </em>(1987), 483 U.S. 868, 107 S.Ct. 3164, 97 L.Ed.2d 709). As we stated in <em>Burke, </em>235 Mont. at 171, 766 P.2d at 257:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b220-4\">To impose a warrant requirement for residential searches, on the basis of rights enjoyed by persons not on probation, would artificially raise a probationer\u2019s privacy interest to a level inconsistent with conditional liberty status. The probation officer must be able to supervise the probationer, and upon his judgment and expertise, search the probationer\u2019s residence or cause it to be searched.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">In this case, however, Burchett does not contest the reasonableness of the search of his residence, but rather asserts that the search was a subterfuge by the police, who did not have probable cause to perform a Fourth Amendment search and who, therefore, involved Burchett\u2019s probation officer so that they could \u201cproceed under the cloak of the probation and parole search clause.\u201d Because Burchett maintains that the search was an attempt by law enforcement to circumvent the warrant requirement, he asserts that the District Court erred when it determined that the search was legal pursuant to both the United States and Montana Constitutions.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">There is no evidence, however, that the search of Burchett\u2019s residence was anything other than a probation and parole search. Probation Officer Steven Hurd initiated and supervised the search based on information he had received from a detective. The information, if true, would have constituted a violation of the terms of Burchett\u2019s probation. It was Hurd who knocked on Burchett\u2019s door and informed him that he was performing a \u201cparole search\u201d and it was Hurd who led the other officers into Burchett\u2019s home to perform the search. Such a search by a probation officer of his probationer is both lawful and constitutionally sound. <em>State v. Small </em>(1989), 235 Mont. 309, 312, 767 P.2d 316, 318.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-7\">Law enforcement assistance does not render an otherwise lawful probation search invalid. In fact, this Court has specifically recognized that Montana\u2019s probation system would be rendered unworkable if police were not available to assist probation officers. <em>State v. Boston </em>(1994), 269 Mont. 300, 889 P.2d 814; <em>State v. Hawkins </em>(1989), 239 Mont. 404, 781 P.2d 259; <em>Burke, </em>235 Mont. 165, 766 P.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>254; <em>Small, </em>235 Mont. 309, 767 P.2d 316. As we stated in <em>Burke, </em>235 Mont. at 170, 766 P.2d at 257: \u201c[W]e encourage cooperation and communication between police and probation officers. Police cooperation with probation officers is to be encouraged as an important aid to effective administration of the probation system.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b221-4\">In this case, based on information he received from law enforcement personnel, Probation Officer Hurd initiated and organized a probation and parole search of Burchett\u2019s residence. Hurd then carried out the search by enlisting the assistance of another probation officer and two detectives who were employed by the sheriff\u2019s department. The fact that Hurd received the information that Burchett was in violation of the terms of his probation from a police officer does not establish that the search was a subterfuge. Rather, the cooperation demonstrated in this case is exactly the type of cooperation and communication this Court has encouraged between probation officers and law enforcement personnel to aid in the effective administration of the probation system. <em>See Burke, </em>235 Mont. at 170, 766 P.2d at 257; <em>Hawkins, </em>239 Mont. at 411, 781 P.2d at 263.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">We hold that the District Court\u2019s conclusion that Probation Officer Hurd conducted a legitimate probation search based upon reasonable cause and that the search was not a subterfuge for the police is correct as a matter of law. We therefore affirm the District Court\u2019s denial of Burchett\u2019s motion to suppress evidence seized during a probation search.</p>\n<judges id=\"b221-6\">CHIEF JUSTICE TURNAGE, JUSTICES NELSON, GRAY and HUNT concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
