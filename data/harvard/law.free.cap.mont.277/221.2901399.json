We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-9\">Monaco raises the following issues on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b246-10\">1. Did the District Court abuse its discretion in allowing the prosecuting attorney to testify relating to the defendant\u2019s statements at a deposition?</p>\n<p id=\"b246-11\">2. Did the District Court err in denying defendant\u2019s motion to exclude evidence relating to defendant\u2019s prior acts?</p>\n<p id=\"b246-12\">Monaco was employed by Hargrove Trucking of Bozeman, Montana, as a log-truck driver. On July 5,1990, Monaco was hauling logs from a job-site near Augusta, Montana. En route, he received a call on his radio from Bob Piper, a Hargrove employee, requesting that Monaco pick up, and attach, a trailer to his truck in Augusta on his way to the job-site. Monaco asserts that he did not have the proper equipment to pick up the trailer but that he was directed to do so or risk losing his job. Monaco claims that he attempted to hitch up the trailer to his truck and, in so doing, injured his back.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-13\">Monaco filed a claim with the State Mutual Compensation Insurance Fund (State Fund). State Fund accepted the claim and, in all, paid Monaco $22,116.36 in benefits. On August 12,1994, Monaco was charged with felony theft in violation of \u00a7\u00a7 45-6-301(5)(b) and 45-6-301(7)(b), MCA. The information alleged that during the period <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>between the alleged accident on July 5, 1990 and December of 1991, Monaco purposely or knowingly obtained or exerted unauthorized control over benefits from the State Fund by means of deception or other fraudulent action. Trial commenced on September 18,1995 and the jury returned a guilty verdict on September 22,1995. Additional facts will be set forth as necessary for our resolution of the issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-4\">1. Did the District Court abuse its discretion in allowing the prosecuting attorney to testify relating to the defendant\u2019s statements at a deposition?</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">Monaco asserts that the District Court abused its discretion in allowing Assistant Attorney General and Special Deputy County Attorney Elizabeth Horsman-Wiitala, to testify as to statements made by Monaco in his deposition given in related civil proceedings before the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court. Horsman-Wiitala was previously counsel for State Fund and was present at Monaco\u2019s deposition. By the time of the criminal trial, however, the certified copy of the deposition had been lost and the District Court ruled that Horsman-Wiitala could testify regarding Monaco\u2019s deposition testimony that he had no prior industrial injuries. Although the court initially stated that Horsman-Wiitala\u2019s testimony would be \u201cfoundational\u201d only, the court then instructed the jury that \u201cshe\u2019s going to testify as to the deposition and the contents thereof.\u201d Thus, Monaco\u2019s counsel was on notice that the contents of the deposition would be before the jury through Horsman-Wiitala\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">At trial, Monaco\u2019s objection to Horsman-Wiitala\u2019s testimony was directed to the question of whether Monaco had reviewed and signed his deposition and to the question of \u201cwhether or not [Horsman-Wiitala] has an interest in the outcome of this case.\u201d In cross-examining Horsman-Wiitala, Monaco\u2019s counsel focused primarily on whether Monaco had signed the deposition. Monaco did not present the District Court with the argument that Horsman-Wiitala\u2019s testimony should not have been admitted or that she, having become a witness, should not have been allowed to continue prosecuting the case. Monaco raises these arguments for the first time on appeal. In fact, the inquiry into whether Horsman-Wiitala would be disqualified from continuing to prosecute the case after she testified was raised solely by the deputy county attorney assisting Horsman-Wiitala.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-7\">This Court has consistently held that the failure to object constitutes a waiver of the objection pursuant to \u00a7 46-20-104, MCA, unless the circumstances come within an exception found at \u00a7 46-20-701(2), MCA. <em>State v. Riley </em>(1995), 270 Mont. 436, 439, 893 P.2d 310, 313 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>(citing <em>State v. Arlington </em>(1994), 265 Mont. 127, 158, 875 P.2d 307, 326); <em>State v. Stuit </em>(1994), 268 Mont. 176, 182, 885 P.2d 1290, 1294. Section 46-20-104(2), MCA, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-4\">(2) Upon appeal from a judgment, the court may review the verdict or decision and any alleged error objected to which involves the merits or necessarily affects the judgment. <em>Failure to make a timely objection during trial constitutes a waiver of the objection except as provided in 46-20-701(2). </em>[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">Section 46-20-701(2), MCA, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-6\">(2) Any error, defect, irregularity, or variance which does not affect substantial rights shall be disregarded. No claim alleging an error affecting jurisdictional or constitutional rights may be noticed on appeal, if the alleged error was not objected to as provided in 46-20-104, unless the defendant [convicted person] establishes that the error was prejudicial as to his guilt or punishment and that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-7\">(a) the right asserted in the claim did not exist at the time of the trial and has been determined to be retroactive in its application;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-8\">(b) the prosecutor, the judge, or a law enforcement agency suppressed evidence from the defendant [convicted person] or his attorney that prevented the claim from being raised and disposed of; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-9\">(c) material and controlling facts upon which the claim is predicated were not known to the defendant [convicted person] or his attorney and could not have been ascertained by the exercise of reasonable diligence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b248-10\">In the instant case, the record does not suggest, nor does Monaco argue, that any of the exceptions enumerated in \u00a7 46-20-701(2), MCA, apply. Rather, Monaco invites this Court to invoke the \u201cplain error\u201d exception to \u00a7 46-20-104, MCA. <em>See, e.g., State v. Finley </em>(1996), [276 Mont. 126], 915 P.2d 208, 212. We decline Monaco\u2019s invitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-11\">Although we recently held that the doctrine of common law plain error review continues to survive despite the existence of Montana\u2019s plain error statute, this appeal does not represent the exceptional case necessary to invoke the plain error doctrine. <em>Finley, </em>915 P.2d at 215 (citing <em>Arlington, </em>875 P.2d at 322). In <em>Finley, </em>we discussed the background and application of the common law doctrine of plain error as well as the statutory requirements of \u00a7 46-20-701(2), MCA. In <em>Finley, </em>we held that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-12\">this Court may discretionarity review claimed errors that implicate a criminal defendant\u2019s fundamental constitutional rights, even if no contemporaneous objection is made and notwithstand<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>ing the inapplicability of the \u00a7 46-20-701(2), MCA, criteria, where failing to review the claimed error at issue may result in a manifest miscarriage of justice, may leave unsettled the question of the fundamental fairness of the trial or proceedings, or may compromise the integrity of the judicial process.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b249-4\"><em>Finley, </em>915 P.2d at 215.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">Here, the District Court\u2019s determination that Horsman-Wiitala could testify as to Monaco\u2019s deposition statement that he had had no prior industrial injuries does not rise to the level of a manifest miscarriage of justice, will not leave unsettled the question of the fundamental fairness of the trial or proceedings, nor will it compromise the integrity of the judicial process. <em>See Finley, </em>915 P.2d at 215. Accordingly, we determine that Monaco\u2019s failure to make a contemporaneous objection precludes this Court from addressing this argument. Section 46-20-104(2), MCA; <em>Riley, </em>893 P.2d at 313; <em>Stuit, </em>885 P.2d at 1294; <em>Arlington, </em>875 P.2d at 325-26.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">In addition, we note that Monaco\u2019s false statement in the deposition that he had never filed a prior claim would have been before the jury in any event. Even if Horsman-Wiitala had been precluded from testifying as to the contents of the deposition, her testimony laid the foundation for another witness, the State\u2019s investigator, to rely on the contents of the deposition which were part of his investigation file. Monaco raised no substantive objection to Horsman-Wiitala\u2019s characterization of his deposition testimony. Horsman-Wiitala\u2019s testimony accurately reflected Monaco\u2019s statement. Thus, Monaco was not prejudiced by Horsman-Wiitala\u2019s testimony and any error by the District Court in allowing her testimony would have been harmless under the facts of this case. <em>See Arlington, 875 </em>P.2d at 325.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-7\">2. Did the District Court err in denying defendant\u2019s motion to exclude evidence relating to defendant\u2019s prior acts?</p>\n<p id=\"b249-8\">In reviewing evidentiary rulings of the district court, we determine whether the district court abused its discretion. <em>State v. Gollehon </em>(1993), 262 Mont. 293, 301, 864 P.2d 1257, 1263. The determination of whether evidence is relevant and admissible is left to the sound discretion of the trial judge and will not be overturned absent a showing of abuse of discretion. <em>State v. Stringer </em>(1995), 271 Mont. 367, 374, 897 P.2d 1063, 1067; <em>Gollehon, </em>864 P.2d at 1263.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-9\">In filling out his State Fund claim, Monaco stated that he had not made any prior claims. As the State correctly notes, it was required to establish the existence of the prior claims in order to show that Monaco\u2019s statement was false and, therefore, that Monaco committed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>theft by deception. Monaco asserts that the District Court abused its discretion when it denied his motion to exclude evidence relating to allegedly fraudulent workers\u2019 compensation claims he filed in Florida and Wyoming. Monaco argues that the court, in allowing evidence that he filed prior claims and excluding all evidence of the details of the claims unless he attempted to explain them away, \u2018left the door open for the remaining Florida and Wyoming evidence to become admissible if [Monaco] attempted to cross examine. ...\u201d According to Monaco, the court\u2019s ruling had the effect of denying him his Sixth Amendment right to cross-examination. Monaco argues that if he were to cross-examine witnesses regarding the filing of the Florida and Wyoming claims, then, through the State\u2019s anticipated rebuttal, specific details of those claims would be before the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-4\">The State counters that the District Court properly limited the evidence to the filing of the Florida and Wyoming claims either as part of the corpus delicti of the charge of theft by deception or, alternatively, as evidence of other acts under Rule 404(b), M.R.Evid. Further, the State asserts that if Monaco \u201copened the door\u201d to the substance of the prior claims the State would be allowed to refute that testimony. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">In <em>State v. Hage </em>(1993), 258 Mont. 498, 506, 853 P.2d 1251, 1256, this Court noted that the State is entitled to present the entire corpus delicti of the crime charged, including matters closely related to the offense and explanatory of the crime. Establishing the fact that Monaco had previously filed claims in Florida and Wyoming was essential to show that Monaco lied to State Fund when he stated that he had not filed prior claims. Therefore, the evidence of previous claims having been filed was properly admitted as part of the corpus delicti of the crime of fraud by deception; accordingly, we need not address Monaco\u2019s argument that the evidence should have been excluded as \u201cother crimes\u201d evidence under Rule 404(b), M.R.Evid., <em>State v. Matt </em>(1991), 249 Mont. 136, 814 P.2d 52, and <em>State v. Just </em>(1979), 184 Mont. 262, 602 P.2d 957. We hold that the evidence was admissible as part of the corpus delicti and that the District Court did not abuse its discretion in denying Monaco\u2019s motion to exclude evidence of the prior claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b250-7\">CHIEF JUSTICE TURNAGE, JUSTICES NELSON, TRIEWEILER and ERDMANN concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
