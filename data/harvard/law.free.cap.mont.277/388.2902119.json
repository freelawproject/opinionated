We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-10\">The Sirokys present four issues on appeal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b414-11\">1. Is Jessica an \u201cIndian child\u201d as defined by the ICWA?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b414-12\">2. Does application of the ICWA deny Jessica her constitutional rights?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b414-14\">3. Have Jessica\u2019s best interests been addressed?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b414-15\">4. Is the Montana Department of Public Health and Human Services\u2019 (Department) consent required for the adoption of Jessica pursuant to \u00a7 40-8-111, MCA?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b414-18\">The background to this case is set forth in this Court\u2019s opinion in <em>In re Adoption of Riffle </em>(1995), 273 Mont. 237, 902 P.2d 542. In <em>Adoption of Riffle, </em>Garlick, who is an enrolled member of the Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa Indians, the Department, and the Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa Indians (the Tribe) appealed the District Court\u2019s grant of the Sirokys\u2019 petition for adoption of Jessica. We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>reversed and remanded for a determination of whether Jessica is an \u201cIndian child\u201d pursuant to 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1903(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b415-4\">In <em>Adoption of Riffle, </em>we held that, in determining whether a child is an \u201cIndian child\u201d pursuant to the ICWA, the Tribe is the ultimate authority on eligibility for tribal membership. <em>Adoption of Riffle, </em>902 P.2d at 545. The ICWA defines an \u201cIndian child\u201d as \u201cany unmarried person who is under age eighteen and is either (a) a member of an Indian tribe or (b) is eligible for membership in an Indian tribe and is the biological child of a member of an Indian tribe.\u201d 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1903(4). Consequently, we held that the district court erred in relying on the Bureau of Indian Affairs\u2019 (BIA) determination that Jessica is ineligible for tribal membership based on her blood quantum. <em>Adoption of Riffle, </em>902 P.2d at 545. Furthermore, we held that the Tribe must be allowed to intervene in the proceeding. <em>Adoption of Riffle, </em>902 P.2d at 545.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-5\">On remand, the District Court concluded that the Tribe\u2019s determination that Jessica is an Indian child and is a member of the Tribe was conclusive. Thus, the court determined that the ICWA applied to Jessica\u2019s adoption. Consequently, although the court found that both the Sirokys and Garlick could provide a loving, caring and secure environment for Jessica, the court concluded that there was no good cause not to follow the ICWA placement preferences and that the ICWA preference favored placement with Jessica\u2019s uncle, Garlick. Thus, the court granted Garlick\u2019s petition for adoption of Jessica and concluded that it was in Jessica\u2019s best interest to maintain contact with the Sirokys.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-6\">We review district court conclusions of law to determine whether the court\u2019s interpretation of law is correct. <em>Adoption of Riffle, </em>902 P.2d at 544 (citing <em>Steer, Inc. v. Department of Revenue </em>(1990), 245 Mont. 470, 474, 803 P.2d 601, 603).</p>\n<p id=\"b415-7\">1. Is Jessica an \u201cIndian child\u201d as defined by the ICWA?</p>\n<p id=\"b415-8\">We find this issue to be dispositive. There are two prerequisites to the application of the ICWA: (1) a child custody proceeding; and (2) an Indian child. 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1903; <em>see generally </em>Debra DuMontier-Pierre, <em>The Indian Child Welfare Act of 1978: A Montana Analysis, </em>56 Mont. L. Rev. 505, 510 (1995). The instant case meets both prerequisites.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-9\"><em>In Adoption of Riffle, </em>we quoted \u00a7 B.l.(b)(i) of the Department of Interior Guidelines for State Courts when interpreting the ICWA:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AMA\">The determination by the tribe that a child is not a member of that tribe, or is not eligible for membership in that tribe, or that the biological parent is or is not a member of that tribe is conclusive.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b416-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number><em>Adoption of Riffle, </em>902 P.2d at 545. We held that the Tribe is the ultimate authority on eligibility for tribal membership. <em>Adoption of Riffle, </em>902 P.2d at 545.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-4\">In the instant case, the Tribe filed papers with the District Court officially recognizing Jessica as an Indian child and a \u201cmember of the tribe\u201d under the provisions of the ICWA. Contrary to the Sirokys\u2019 contention, enrollment of the child in the Tribe is not required so long as the Tribe recognizes the child as a member. <em>In re Junious M. </em>(Cal. Ct. App. 1983), 193 Cal.Rptr. 40, 44. Enrollment and membership are not synonymous. <em>In re Baby Boy Doe </em>(Idaho 1993), 849 P.2d 925, 931. Enrollment is a common but not exclusive evidentiary means of determining membership in a tribe. <em>Baby Boy Doe, </em>849 P.2d at 931 (citing 44 Fed.Reg. 67,584, 67,586 (1979)). Given the Tribe\u2019s determination that Jessica is an Indian child, we hold that the District Court correctly concluded that the Tribe\u2019s determination was conclusive.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-5\">Since Jessica is an Indian child, the ICWA applies to this adoption proceeding. Accordingly, the District Court properly applied the adoptive placement preferences found at 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915. 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(a) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-6\">In any adoptive placement of an Indian child under State law, a preference shall be given, in the absence of good cause to the contrary, to a placement with</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-7\">(1) a member of the child\u2019s extended family;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-8\">(2) other members of the Indian child\u2019s tribe; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-9\">(3) other Indian families.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b416-10\">The child\u2019s extended family is defined at 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1903(2) as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-11\">\u201cextended family member\u201d shall be as defined by the law or custom of the Indian child\u2019s tribe or, in the absence of such law or custom, shall be a person who has reached the age of eighteen and who is the Indian child\u2019s grandparent, aunt or <em>uncle, </em>brother or sister, brother-in-law or sister-in-law, niece or nephew, first or second cousin, or stepparent!.] [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b416-12\">As Jessica\u2019s uncle, Garlick clearly falls within the definition of \u201cextended family member.\u201d The District Court was thus correct in giving Garlick the benefit of the adoptive placement preference under 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(a).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-13\">2. Does application of the ICWA deny Jessica her constitutional rights?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b417-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>The Sirokys ask this Court to adopt the rationale of the California appellate court in its recent decision in <em>In re Bridget R. </em>(Cal. Ct. App. 1996) 49 Cal.Rptr.2d 507. In <em>In re Bridget R., </em>the California court held that the ICWA could not be constitutionally applied in the absence of evidence that the biological parents have a significant social, cultural, or political relationship with the Tribe. <em>In re Bridget R., </em>49 Cal. Rptr.2d at 526.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-4\">In 1978, Congress passed the ICWA in response to a significant threat to the integrity of Indian cultures caused by the alarmingly high incidence of often unwarranted removal of Indian children from their families. 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1901(4). Congress declared that \u201cit is the policy of this Nation to protect the best interests of Indian children and to promote the stability and security of Indian tribes and families by the establishment of minimum Federal standards for the removal of Indian children from their families. ...\u201d 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1902. As this Court has previously stated, we share Congress\u2019 concern and support its policy. <em>In re Baby Girl Jane Doe </em>(1993), 262 Mont. 380, 385, 865 P.2d 1090, 1092; <em>In re M.E.M. </em>(1981), 195 Mont. 329, 333, 635 P.2d 1313, 1315-16. In <em>In re M.E.M., </em>we stated that it was our constitutional duty to preserve the unique cultural heritage and integrity of the American Indians. Mont. Const, art. X, \u00a7 1(2); <em>In re M.E.M., </em>635 P.2d at 1316. Moreover, in <em>Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians v. Holyfield </em>(1989), 490 U.S. 30, 109 S.Ct. 1597, 104 L.Ed.2d 29, the United States Supreme Court affirmed the intent and purposes of the ICWA. In <em>In re Baby Girl Doe, </em>we discussed <em>Mississippi Choctaw </em>at length and concluded that \u201cthe principal purposes of the Act are to promote the stability and security of Indian tribes by preventing further loss of their children; and to protect the best interests of Indian children by retaining their connection to their tribes.\u201d <em>In re Baby Girl Doe, </em>865 P.2d at 1095. Accordingly, we hold that the application of the ICWA does not deny Jessica her constitutional rights and we decline to adopt the California Court\u2019s approach in <em>In re Bridget R.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">3. Have Jessica\u2019s best interests been addressed?</p>\n<p id=\"b417-6\">The Sirokys contend that the District Court should have made a \u201cbest interest\u201d analysis under \u00a7 40-8-109, MCA, outside the restrictions, preferences or limitations of the ICWA. However, since we affirm the District Court\u2019s determination that the ICWA applies to this adoption, a determination of \u201cbest interests\u201d under Montana law would be inappropriate. The ICWA expresses the presumption that in an adoptive placement of an Indian child, the child\u2019s best interests <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>are best served by placement with an extended family member. 25 U.S.C. 1915(a)(1). To overcome this preference, a party must establish the existence of \u201cgood cause to the contrary.\u201d 25 U.S.C. 1915(a)(1). BIA guidelines provide \u201cgood cause to the contrary\u201d must be based upon one or more of the following considerations:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-4\">(i) The request of the biological parents or the child when the child is of sufficient age.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-5\">(ii) The extraordinary physical or emotional needs of the child as established by testimony of a qualified expert witness.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-6\">(iii) The unavailability of suitable families for placement after a diligent search has been completed for families meeting the preference criteria.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b418-7\">Guidelines for State Courts; Indian Child Custody Proceedings, 44 Fed.Reg. 67,584, 67,594 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b418-8\">At least two courts which have interpreted the \u201cgood cause\u201d exception of 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915 have determined that courts may consider the best interests of the child in determining whether the exception <em>applies.</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> Matter of Adoption of F.H. </em>(Alaska 1993), 851 P.2d 1361, and <em>Adoption of M. </em>(Wash. Ct. App. 1992), 832 P.2d 518. The Minnesota Supreme Court, however, has rejected this interpretation and we agree. The Minnesota Supreme Court held that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-9\">We believe, however, that a finding of good cause cannot be based simply on a determination that placement outside the preferences would be in the child\u2019s best interests. The plain language of the Act read as a whole and its legislative history clearly indicate that state courts are a part of the problem the ICWA was intended to remedy. <em>See Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians, </em>490 U.S. at 44-45, 109 S.Ct. at 1606-07. ... The best interests of the child standard, by its very nature, requires a subjective evaluation of a multitude of factors, many, if not all of which are imbued with the values of majority culture. It therefore seems \u201cmost improbable\u201d that Congress intended to allow state courts to find good cause whenever they determined that a placement outside the preferences of \u00a7 1915 was in the Indian child\u2019s best interests. <em>Cf Missis</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number><em>sippi Band of Choctaw Indians, </em>490 U.S. at 45, 109 S.Ct. at 1606-07.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b419-5\"><em>Matter of Custody of S.E.G. </em>(Minn. 1994), 521 N.W.2d 357, 362-63.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-6\">Although the District Court cited <em>Adoption of M. </em>and concluded that \u201cthere was no good cause not to follow the placement preference <em>and Garlick\u2019s adoption is in the best interests of the child\u201d </em>(emphasis added), that conclusion, to the extent that it determines \u201cbest interests,\u201d is an unnecessary and inappropriate analysis under the ICWA. The determination that there was no \u201cgood cause\u201d not to follow the ICWA placement preference was sufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-7\">In the present case, the record clearly supports the conclusion that there was no \u201cgood cause\u201d for overcoming the placement preferences of the ICWA: the Department had approved Garlick as providing an approved adoptive home; Garlick is bonded with Jessica; he had significant contact with her dining the first 18 months of her life; he is Jessica\u2019s uncle and, as such, is part of her extended family; Jessica\u2019s natural mother supported Garlick as the adoptive parent for Jessica, and; the Department supports Garlick as the adoptive parent for Jessica.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-8\">We affirm the District Court\u2019s decision to adhere to the adoption preferences established by the ICWA.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-9\">4. Is the Montana Department of Public Health and Human Services\u2019 consent required for the adoption of Jessica pursuant to \u00a7 40-8-111, MCA?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b419-12\">We hold that the District Court correctly applied the provisions of the ICWA and granted Garlick\u2019s Petition for Final Adoption of Jessica Lynn Riffle. The Department supported and consented to Garlick\u2019s adoption of Jessica. Since the court did not grant the Sirokys\u2019 petition to adopt, the Sirokys\u2019 argument that they do not need the Department\u2019s consent to petition for the adoption of Jessica is moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-13\">Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b419-14\">CHIEF JUSTICE TURNAGE, JUSTICES TRIEWEILER and HUNT concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b418-10\">. We note that in <em>In re </em>M.E.M., we stated that, in determining whether to transfer jurisdiction to the tribal court, \u201cthe best interest of the child could prevent transfer of jurisdiction upon \u2018clear and convincing\u2019 showing by the State.\u201d <em>In re M.E.M., </em>635 P.2d at 1317. In the instant case, however, we are not considering the transfer of jurisdiction to a tribal court; rather, we are considering adoption placement preferences under 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(a)(1). Thus, <em>In re M.E.M. </em>is not controlling on this issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b419-15\">JUSTICE GRAY,</author>\n<p id=\"Apn\">specially concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-16\">I concur in the result reached in the Court\u2019s opinion and with much of what is said therein. On the basis of the record before us, however, I disagree with the Court\u2019s conclusion that Jessica is an \u201cIndian child\u201d as defined by the ICWA and its related conclusion that the ICWA applies. I would affirm the District Court on the basis of that court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>determination that Jessica\u2019s adoption by her uncle, John Garlick, is in her best interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-4\">As the Court correctly observes, the ICWA defines an \u201cIndian child\u201d as \u201cany unmarried person who is under age eighteen and is either (a) a member of an Indian tribe or (b) is eligible for membership in an Indian tribe and is the biological child of a member of an Indian tribe.\u201d <em>See </em>25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1903(4). I also agree with the Court that a Tribe\u2019s determination that a child is \u201ca member or eligible for membership\u201d is conclusive for purposes of the ICWA.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">The Court states that the Tribe officially recognized Jessica as an Indian child and \u201ca member of the Tribe.\u201d I agree that the Tribe stated that Jessica is \u201can Indian child;\u201d that statement is not conclusive on the District Court, however, because it is a conclusion of law that only the court can make by applying the ICWA definitions to the record before it.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-6\">I disagree with the Court\u2019s conclusion that the Tribe\u2019s \u201crecognition\u201d of Jessica as a member of the Tribe meets either definition of an \u201cIndian child\u201d under the ICWA. I do not find of record any statement by the Tribe that Jessica either is a member of, or <em>is eligible </em>for membership in, the Tribe. What the Tribe does say is that Jessica is \u201crecognized as a member during her childhood.\u201d It is my view that the ICWArequires more than this. Thus, while I agree with the Court that the language of the ICWA does not require that the child actually be enrolled as a member, the ICWA does require that the child be a member or eligible for membership. No clear and unequivocal determination to either effect has been made by the Tribe.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-7\">Notwithstanding my disagreement with the Court over whether the ICWA applies here, however, I also would affirm the District Court. The District Court determined that it is in Jessica\u2019s best interests to be adopted by her uncle, John Garlick, and there is a surfeit of evidence on the record to support that determination.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
