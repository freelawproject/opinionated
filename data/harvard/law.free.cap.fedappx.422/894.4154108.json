That court dismissed the appeal as untimely, concluding that the 120-day appeal pe<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"978\">*978</page-number>riod established by 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7266(a) for seeking review of Board of Veterans\u2019 Appeals decisions is jurisdictional and not subject to equitable tolling. The appellant sought this court\u2019s review.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">This court stayed the briefing schedule in this appeal pending the United States Supreme Court\u2019s review of our decision in <em>Henderson v. Shinseki, </em>589 F.3d 1201 (Fed.Cir.2009) (en banc) (affirming Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims determination that period to appeal to that court is not subject to equitable tolling). In <em>Henderson ex rel. Henderson v. Shinseki, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 1197, 179 L.Ed.2d 159 (2011), the Supreme Court reversed this court\u2019s decision and concluded that the 120-day deadline for filing an appeal with the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims does not have jurisdictional consequences. Because the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims erred in concluding that the appeal deadline established by \u00a7 7266(a) is jurisdictional, we vacate the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims\u2019 judgment and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-8\">Accordingly,</p>\n<p id=\"b336-9\">It Is Ordered That:</p>\n<p id=\"b336-10\">(1) The motion is granted. The judgment is vacated and the case is remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-11\">(2) All sides shall bear their own costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
