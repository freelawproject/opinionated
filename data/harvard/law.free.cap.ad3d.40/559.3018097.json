Contrary to the defendant\u2019s contentions, the Supreme Court properly concluded that the three attempts made by the plaintiffs process server to personally serve him at his residence satisfied the due diligence requirement under the circumstances <em>(see Johnson v Waters, </em>291 AD2d 481 [2002]; <em>Singh v Gold Coin Laundry Equip., </em>234 AD2d 358 [1996]; <em>Rodriguez v Khamis, </em>201 AD2d 715 [1994]; <em>Matos v Knibbs, </em>186 AD2d 725 [1992]). The resolution of issues of credibility was within the domain of the hearing court <em>(see Ortiz v Jamwant, </em>305 AD2d 477 [2003]; <em>Koslosky v Koslosky, </em>267 AD2d 357 [1999]; <em>McGuirk v Mugs Pub, </em>250 AD2d 824 [1998]).</p>\n<p id=\"b593-10\">The defendant\u2019s remaining contentions are without merit. Prudenti, P.J., Fisher, Lifson and Angiolillo, JJ., concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
