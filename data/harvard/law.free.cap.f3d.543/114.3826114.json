After unlawfully entering the country and being placed in removal proceedings, Bin applied <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>for asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the Convention Against Torture (CAT). He grounded these claims on his alleged arrests and abuse in China for engaging in a spiritual-meditative practice called Falun Gong. Following a hearing, an Immigration Judge (IJ) denied Bin\u2019s claims for two reasons: first, that Bin\u2019s testimony in support of his claims was not credible, and second, that even if the testimony were credible, it failed to meet the burdens of proof necessary for the requested forms of relief. Bin then appealed to the BIA. The Government contends that Bin failed to contest the IJ\u2019s credibility determination in his appeal to the BIA, and that we are therefore without jurisdiction to consider Bin\u2019s petition to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">We agree that Bin failed to raise the adverse credibility finding in his appeal to the BIA. We hold, however, that because the BIA nonetheless considered the adverse credibility determination, the issue was sufficiently exhausted to provide us with jurisdiction to review it. Exercising this jurisdiction, we find that substantial evidence supports the credibility determination, and accordingly, we will deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"AZ\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-9\">Bin is a 23-year-old native and citizen of the People\u2019s Republic of China. On October 1, 2004, Bin arrived in the United States through Mexico. When approached by Border Patrol agents, he stated that he entered the country to find work.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He was subsequently placed in removal proceedings, where he admitted the factual allegations against him and conceded his re-movability. Thereafter, Bin submitted his application for asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the CAT.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b143-10\">At a February 24, 2005 hearing before the IJ, Bin testified on his own behalf. He explained that he began practicing Falun Gong<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> in 1998, when he was in the fifth grade, because he suffered from inflammatory diseases of the stomach and intestine and that neither \u201cWestern trained\u201d medical doctors nor \u201cChinese herbal doctors\u201d were able to alleviate his symptoms. A.R. 75. As a result, Bin began to practice Falun Gong when his mother\u2019s friend convinced him that it would help his illnesses. No one else in his family practiced, so Bin bought some books and a video on Falun Gong. On direct examination, Bin testified that he practiced with other Falun Gong practitioners at a nearby park \u201conce or twice,\u201d though the IJ found that Bin contradicted himself on cross-examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>A.R. 77.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b144-4\">Bin claimed that he was arrested twice for practicing Falun Gong, first in August 1999 and again in January 2004. He testified that the first time, five or six police officers came to his house, took him by force, and did not give a reason for his arrest. According to Bin, the officers interrogated and beat him badly, but he could not recall the substance of their questioning. Bin stated that two days later, he was sent to a detention center in Qwan Do, China, where he was detained for more than two months. Bin testified that many other inmates were detained there because they also practiced Falun Gong. He stated that he was beaten by the authorities \u2014 hit and kicked in the leg and beaten with a club. Bin claimed that he was eventually released, two months later, after he signed a document stating that he would never practice Falun Gong again.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-5\">According to Bin, he was arrested again in January 2004 and accused of practicing Falun Gong. The authorities detained him for one month and did not allow his mother to visit him. He claimed that he was beaten once while detained, and that he suffered bruises. He alleged that his mother was also interrogated after his detention. He was released on January 15, 2004, and departed China in September 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-6\">On March 3, 2005, the IJ denied Bin\u2019s applications for asylum, withholding of removal, and CAT protection and ordered him removed. The IJ denied asylum for two distinct reasons. First, even assuming Bin\u2019s testimony was truthful, the evidence did not support a finding of past persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution as is required to prevail on an asylum claim. Second, the IJ found Bin not credible due to material inconsistencies within his testimony and between his testimony and his written affidavit. Specifically, the IJ determined that while Bin\u2019s affidavit stated that the police told Bin the reason for his first arrest, he testified before the IJ that the police gave no reason for the arrest. In addition, the IJ determined that Bin testified inconsistently about where, and with whom, he practiced Falun Gong after his first arrest. The IJ also found that Bin did not meet the more exacting standard for withholding of removal or the standard for relief under the CAT.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-10\">On March 7, 2005, Bin, through his prior counsel, filed a notice of appeal with the BIA. The notice of appeal did not assert which issues Bin was appealing but instead stated that he would file a separate brief. In the separate brief, Bin listed the following arguments:</p>\n<p id=\"b144-11\">I. THE IJ ERRED IN FINDING THAT [BIN]\u2019S ARRESTS AND DETENTION IN 1999 AND 2004 DID NOT CONSTITUTE PERSECUTION WITHIN THE MEANING OF THE IMMIGRATION AND NATIONALITY ACT (\u201cINA\u201d); RESPONDENT CLEARLY SUFFERED PERSECUTION AT THE HANDS OF THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT, AND THUS, IS CLEARLY ELIGIBLE FOR ASYLUM.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-12\">II. THE IJ ERRED IN FINDING THAT [BIN]\u2019S TWO DETENTIONS DO NOT RISE TO THE LEVEL OF PERSECUTION; [BIN] SUFFERED SIGNIFICANT DEPRIVATION OF FREEDOM AND LIBERTY ON ACCOUNT OF HIS BEING A FA-LUN GONG PRACTITIONER.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-13\">A.R. 12,13.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-14\">On May 4, 2006, the BIA \u201cadopt[ed] and affirm[ed] the decision of the [IJ] to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>extent the [IJ] concluded [Bin] was not credible and did not therefore meet the burden of proof for asylum, withholding of removal and protection under the Convention Against Torture.\u201d A.R. 2. The BIA did not address Bin\u2019s two allegations of error, having instead adopted the adverse credibility determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-6\">We generally have jurisdiction to review a final order of removal under section 242(a)(1) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA). <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(1); <em>Yan Lan Wu v. Ashcroft, </em>393 F.3d 418, 421 (3d Cir.2005). Section 242(d)(1) of the INA, however, limits our jurisdiction to cases where a petitioner \u201chas exhausted all administrative remedies available as of right....\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1); <em>see Abdulrahman v. Ashcroft, </em>330 F.3d 587, 594-95 (3d Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b145-7\">Where we do have jurisdiction to entertain a petition for review and \u201cthe BIA adopted the IJ\u2019s opinion, we treat that opinion as the opinion of the [BIA].\u201d <em>Zhang v. Gonzales, </em>405 F.3d 150, 155 (3d Cir.2005). Accordingly, we review the IJ\u2019s opinion to the extent the BIA relied upon it. <em>Wang v. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>423 F.3d 260, 267 (3d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b145-8\">Review of an IJ\u2019s decision, including an adverse credibility determination, \u201cis conducted under the substantial evidence standard which requires that administrative findings of fact be upheld \u2018unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u2019 \u201d <em>Chen v. Gonzales, </em>434 F.3d 212, 216 (3d Cir.2005) (quoting 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B)). In other words, adverse credibility determinations are afforded deference provided the IJ \u201csupplies] specific, cogent reasons why the applicant is not credible.\u201d <em>Chukwu v. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>484 F.3d 185, 189 (3d Cir.2007); <em>Gao v. Ashcroft, </em>299 F.3d 266, 276 (3d Cir.2002). Under the law applicable to Bin\u2019s petition, the inconsistencies identified by the IJ must not be \u201cminor\u201d and must go to the heart of the petitioner\u2019s claim. <em>Gabuniya v. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>463 F.3d 316, 322 (3d Cir.2006).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b145-11\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-12\">The Government argues that Bin did not raise the issue of the IJ\u2019s credibility determination to the BIA, thereby failing to exhaust his administrative remedies, and thus depriving us of jurisdiction under \u00a7 1252(d)(1). Bin counters that we have jurisdiction to consider the credibility determination because he did raise the issue before the BIA, thereby exhausting his administrative remedies. In the alternative, Bin argues that even if he did not raise the credibility determination, the BIA\u2019s <em>sua sponte </em>consideration of the issue provides us with jurisdiction. For the reasons discussed below, we conclude that Bin did not raise the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding to the BIA, but because the BIA considered the credibility issue <em>sua sponte, </em>we nonetheless have jurisdiction to review it.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-13\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-14\">As stated earlier, under \u00a7 1252(d)(1), \u201ca court may review a final order of removal only if [ ] the alien has exhausted all administrative remedies available to the alien as of right....\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1). The parties dispute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>what Congress meant by the term \u201cadministrative remedies.\u201d While our jurisprudence has been less than clear as to whether the statute requires exhaustion of administrative procedures, claims, or issues, <em>compare Khan v. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>448 F.3d 226, 236 n. 8 (3d Cir.2006), <em>with Zheng v. Gonzales, </em>417 F.3d 379, 383 (3d Cir.2005), we are bound by those opinions that have interpreted issue exhaustion as a statutory requirement. <em>See, e.g., Kibinda v. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>477 F.3d 113, 120 n. 8 (3d Cir.2007) (finding petitioner\u2019s unraised issue unexhausted and thus precluded by \u00a7 1252(d)(l)\u2019s \u201cstatutory [exhaustion] requirement\u201d); <em>Abdulrahman, </em>330 F.3d at 594-95 (same).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> As compared to judicially-crafted exhaustion doctrines, statutory exhaustion requirements deprive us of jurisdiction over a given case. <em>Metro. Life Ins. Co. v. Price, </em>501 F.3d 271, 278-79 (3d Cir.2007); <em>see Xie v. Ashcroft, </em>359 F.3d 239, 245 n. 8 (3d Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b146-7\">Accordingly, a petitioner is deemed to have \u201cexhausted all administra<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>tive remedies,\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1), and thereby \u201cpreserves the right of judicial review,\u201d <em>Abdulrahman, </em>330 F.3d at 594-95, if he or she raises all issues before the BIA. We do not, however, apply this principle in a draconian fashion. <em>See Joseph v. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>465 F.3d 123, 126 (3d Cir.2006) (noting the Court\u2019s \u201cliberal exhaustion policy\u201d). Indeed, \u201cso long as an immigration petitioner makes some effort, however insufficient, to place the Board on notice of a straightforward issue being raised on appeal, a petitioner is deemed to have exhausted her administrative remedies.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation marks omitted); <em>see Bhiski v. Ashcroft, </em>373 F.3d 363, 367-68 (3d Cir.2004); <em>Yan Lan Wu, </em>393 F.3d at 422 (explaining <em>Bhiski </em>and observing that \u201cwhen a claim is not so complex as to require a supporting brief, simply putting the Board on notice through a Notice of Appeal is sufficient\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b147-4\">For example, in <em>Abdulrahman v. Ashcroft, </em>petitioner Abdulrahman argued to the BIA \u201cthat the IJ erred in her credibility determination and that her findings were not substantially supported by the evidence.\u201d 330 F.3d at 594. Before this Court, Abdulrahman then asserted that \u201cthe IJ erroneously applied the more stringent \u2018more likely than not\u2019 standard, applicable to withholding of removal, to his asylum claim that he suffered past persecution.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We found Abdulrahman\u2019s attempt to argue that he had raised the burden of proof issue before the BIA to be \u201cin vain.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 595. Neither his notice of appeal nor his written brief \u201cviewed expansively ... even suggested] the issue.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We observed that Abdulrah-man\u2019s assertion before the BIA that the IJ \u201cerred as a matter of law and discretion,\u201d was a \u201cgeneralized claim [that] did not alert the Board to the issue he [sought] to raise for the first time here.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation marks omitted); <em>see Joseph, </em>465 F.3d at 126 (finding an issue not exhausted where \u201cpetitioner did nothing to alert the BIA that he wished to appeal the IJ\u2019s determination that he was not <em>prima facie </em>eligible for naturalization\u201d). As Abdulrah-man had failed to put the Board on notice of the issue that he then raised before this Court, we appropriately declined to interfere with the agency\u2019s decisionmaking process by ruling on a contention the BIA had not addressed. <em>Abdulrahman, </em>330 F.3d at 594-95.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-7\">In <em>Yan Lan Wu v. Ashcroft, </em>petitioner Yan argued in her Notice of Appeal to the BIA that \u201cthe Immigration Judge ignored the fact that [her] father was jailed and tortured by the Chinese government as an underground Christian in China, and erred in finding that [she] doesn\u2019t have a fear of [the] Chinese government but the local people.\u201d 393 F.3d at 422 (quotation marks omitted). Additionally, in her supporting brief Yan claimed that she had \u201cpresented sufficient evidence to the effect that she has face[d] past persecution and will face future persecution on account of her Christian faith,\u201d \u201cthat police raided [her] home, and that her home was under surveillance.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation marks omitted). Before our Court, Yan argued that the IJ improperly relied on a preliminary statement she had made at the airport and that the IJ\u2019s decision was not supported by substantial evidence. The Government contended that Yan failed to exhaust her administrative remedies, asserting that Yan \u201cintimates that the Immigration Judge\u2019s reliance on the [airport] statement was misplaced but that this argument was never raised before the Immigration Judge or on appeal to the Board.... \u201d <em>Id. </em>We nevertheless found that Yan did \u201ccontend in her Notice of Appeal that the Immigration Judge\u2019s conclusion [was] not supported by substantial evidence within the record,\u201d and thus the BIA \u201cwas put on notice that there was a claim of error <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>hovering around the Immigration Judge\u2019s findings and, consequently, her exclusive reliance on the airport interview, during its review <em>de novo.\u201d Id; see also Bhiski, </em>373 F.3d at 367-69 (explaining that petitioner\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel argument was exhausted despite his failure to aver, in the Notice of Appeal, that he suffered prejudice, and despite his failure to file a supporting brief).</p>\n<p id=\"b148-4\">In the present case, Bin\u2019s current counsel seemed to concede at oral argument that Bin\u2019s previous counsel had failed to use <em>any </em>language in his Notice of Appeal or brief to the BIA such that the BIA would suspect a claimed error even \u201chovering around\u201d the IJ\u2019s credibility determination. <em>See Yan Lan Wu, </em>393 F.3d at 422. Bin\u2019s Notice of Appeal pressed no arguments whatsoever, but instead merely mentioned that a separate written brief would be submitted. The brief, in turn, referred only to whether Bin\u2019s arrests and detention \u201crise to the level of persecution\u201d or \u201cconstitute persecution within the meaning of the [INA].... \u201d A.R. 12, 13. Thus, unlike in <em>Yan Lan Wu, </em>Bin\u2019s Notice of Appeal and his brief did absolutely nothing to alert the BIA that he was challenging the IJ\u2019s credibility determination. Indeed, this case is the precise inverse of <em>Abdulrahman: </em>whereas the petitioner there challenged the IJ\u2019s factual findings before the BIA but not the applicable legal standard, here, Bin challenged the legal standard before the BIA, but not the IJ\u2019s factual findings (namely, the credibility determination). <em>See </em>330 F.3d at 594. As in <em>Abdulrahman, </em>we reject Bin\u2019s argument that he raised the relevant issue in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">Perhaps recognizing Bin\u2019s failure explicitly to raise the credibility issue to the BIA, Bin\u2019s counsel makes an alternative contention: since an asylum applicant without evidence corroborating his claims of past persecution must testify credibly in order to meet his burden of proof, Bin\u2019s appeal to the BIA only makes sense if he is appealing the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination. Pet\u2019r Reply Br. at 4-5 (citing <em>Lukwago v. Ashcroft, </em>329 F.3d 157, 177 (3d Cir.2003)). Put another way, since Bin cannot prevail on his legal claims without also successfully challenging the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination, the latter issue is implicit in his appeal to the BIA. Bin is asking us, in effect, to create a bright-line rule: any time an IJ has made an adverse credibility determination and there is no corroborating evidence, that issue is necessarily before the BIA on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-7\">We find no authority to support this position. We have said that as long as the petitioner \u201cmade some effort to exhaust, albeit insufficient,\u201d we will exercise jurisdiction over the petitioner\u2019s claims. <em>Bhiski, </em>373 F.3d at 367. Bin has, however, made no such effort. Out of respect for the administrative process, we will not require the BIA to guess which issues have been presented and which have not. Likewise, we will not punish the BIA by interfering in the administrative process with regard to issues that the BIA did not address. Considering the documents supplied by Bin, we have no reason to believe that he put the BIA on notice that he was challenging the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination. <em>Cf. Yan Lan Wu, </em>393 F.3d at 422 (exercising jurisdiction over petitioner\u2019s claims where \u201cwe [were] confident that [petitionerj\u2019s Notice of Appeal and brief in support of [petitioner\u2019s] application made the Board aware of what issues were being appealed\u201d). Accordingly, Bin failed to raise the adverse credibility issue to the BIA.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-8\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-9\">Having determined that Bin failed to raise the issue of the IJ\u2019s credibility <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>determination, we must now address Bin\u2019s contention that we nonetheless have jurisdiction because the BIA, <em>sua sponte, </em>considered this issue and adopted and affirmed the IJ\u2019s decision on this basis. There is certainly a degree of confusion in this area. <em>See Zine v. Mukasey, </em>517 F.3d 535, 540 (8th Cir.2008) (recognizing the \u201cdisagreement among our sister circuits on the [] question whether a claim or issue not presented to the BIA, but considered by the BIA <em>sua sponte, </em>is juris-dictionally barred for failure to exhaust administrative remedies\u201d).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> We note, however, that of the approximately seven courts of appeals to address whether the BIA\u2019s decision to consider an issue provides the court with jurisdiction over the petition for review, only one per curiam opinion by the Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit would find a court without jurisdiction in a case such as this one. <em>Compare Amaya-Artunduaga v. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>463 F.3d 1247, 1250 (11th Cir.2006) (per curiam) (holding that the court lacked \u201cjurisdiction over a claim when an alien, without excuse or exception, fail[ed] to exhaust that claim,\u201d even though \u201cthe BIA nonetheless considered] the underlying issue <em>sua sponte </em>\u201d), <em>with Sidabutar v. Gonzales, </em>503 F.3d 1116, 1119-20 (10th Cir.2007) (holding that the BIA\u2019s <em>sua sponte </em>consideration of petitioners\u2019 claims served as an agency determination that the issues were sufficiently exhausted to confer the court with jurisdiction under \u00a7 1252); <em>Zine, </em>517 F.3d at 540 (accepting \u201cthe agency\u2019s determination that the persecution issue was adequately exhausted as to both [asylum and withholding of removal] claims and therefore reaching] the merits of the withholding\u201d claim despite the petitioner\u2019s failure to raise it explicitly on appeal to the BIA); <em>Pasha v. Gonzales, </em>433 F.3d 530, 532-33 (7th Cir.2005) (explaining that where the BIA could have summarily dismissed an appeal for failure to raise an issue with specificity, but instead affirmed on the merits, the exhaustion requirement was waived); <em>Abebe v. Gonzales, </em>432 F.3d 1037, 1041 (9th Cir.2005) (en banc) (same); <em>Hassan v. Gonzales, </em>403 F.3d 429, 433 (6th Cir.2005) (same); <em>Johnson v. Ashcroft, </em>378 F.3d 164, 170 (2d Cir.2004) (same); <em>see also Singh v. Gonzales, </em>413 F.3d 156, 160 n. 3 (1st Cir.2005) (explaining that even claims not exhausted before the BIA may be addressed by a court of appeals where the BIA summarily affirmed the IJ\u2019s entire opinion, thus rendering the IJ\u2019s decision the final agency determination for purpose of appellate review); <em>Arreguin-Moreno v. Mukasey, </em>511 F.3d 1229, 1232 (9th Cir.2008) (explaining that court was not deprived of jurisdiction despite petitioner\u2019s failure to raise the issue before the BIA where all issues presented to the IJ were deemed to have been presented to the BIA); <em>cf. Wilson v. Pena, </em>79 F.3d 154, 165 (D.C.Cir.1996) (explaining, in the Title VII context, that \u201c[w]here the agency has taken final action based on an evaluation of the merits, it cannot later contend that the complainant failed to exhaust his remedies\u201d). We agree with the logic of the majority of our fellow courts of appeals on this issue and find that we have jurisdiction to address the IJ\u2019s ad<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>verse credibility determination because the BIA considered the issue <em>sua sponte.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b150-4\">For example, in <em>Sidabutar v. Gonzales, </em>petitioners\u2019 appeal to the BIA challenged the IJ\u2019s determinations regarding asylum, but did not contest the IJ\u2019s finding that petitioners were ineligible for withholding of removal or protection under the CAT. 503 F.3d at 1119. While the Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit ordinarily would have found that petitioners\u2019 failure to pursue the latter two grounds for relief constituted a failure to exhaust their administrative remedies, the BIA <em>sua sponte </em>addressed and ruled on both grounds. <em>Id. </em>The court observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-5\">[W]hile \u00a7 1252(d)(1) requires that an alien exhaust \u201call administrative remedies,\u201d the BIA has the authority to determine its agency\u2019s administrative procedures. If the BIA deems an issue sufficiently presented to consider it on the merits, such action by the BIA exhausts the issue as far as the agency is concerned and that is all \u00a7 1252(d)(1) requires to confer our jurisdiction.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Where the BIA determines an issue administratively-ripe to warrant its appellate review, we will not second-guess that determination. Indeed, it is a touchstone of administrative law that \u201cthe formulation of procedures [is] basically to be left within the discretion of the agencies to which Congress had confided the responsibility for substantive judgments.\u201d ... Under 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.3(b) (\u201cspecificity requirement\u201d), an alien taking an appeal of an IJ decision \u201cmust specifically identify the findings of fact, the conclusions of law, or both, that are being challenged.\u201d Nothing in the agency\u2019s regulations preclude the BIA from waiving this requirement. Indeed, the BIA has <em>discretionary </em>authority to dismiss (and conversely, accept) appeals lacking in specificity.... Where the BIA has issued a decision considering the merits of an issue, even <em>sua sponte, </em>[the interests behind the exhaustion rule] have been fulfilled.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b150-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 1120-21 (emphasis in original) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b150-9\">We are persuaded by the Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit\u2019s reasoning in <em>Sidabutar. </em>To begin with, the BIA\u2019s own regulations provide that the BIA <em>\u201cmay </em>summarily dismiss any appeal or portion of any appeal ... [that] fails to specify the reasons for the appeal.... \u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003. l(d)(2)(i) (emphasis added); <em>see also </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.3(b); Form EOIR-26. This permissive language suggests that it is within the agency\u2019s discretion to determine when to dismiss summarily an appeal for lack of specificity and when the BIA is sufficiently apprised of the applicable issues to entertain the appeal. <em>See Esponda v. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>453 F.3d 1319, 1321 (11th Cir.2006); <em>Cf. Bhisky </em>373 F.3d at 368 (explaining that the permissive term \u201cmay\u201d in Notice of Appeal Form EOIR-26 suggests \u201cthat the agency believes that a brief is not necessary in all cases\u201d). Given the BIA\u2019s substantial experience dealing with appeals from an IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination, this discretion is well-placed. <em>Cf. Jasch v. Potter, </em>302 F.3d 1092, 1095 (9th Cir.2002) (explaining in the Title VII context that \u201c[w]hen an agency proceeds to reach the merits of the case rather than dismiss the claim ..., it has determined that sufficient information exists for such adjudication. After all, the agency <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>itself is in a strong position to evaluate whether the complainant has sufficiently complied with [the agency\u2019s] requests.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">As Congress has empowered agencies to carry out their delegated functions, the administrative system contemplates that \u201cagencies \u2018should be free to fashion their own rules of procedure and to pursue methods of inquiry capable of permitting them to discharge their multitudinous duties.\u2019 \u201d <em>Sidabutar, </em>503 F.3d at 1120 (quoting <em>FCC v. Pottsville Broad. Co., </em>309 U.S. 134, 143, 60 S.Ct. 437, 84 L.Ed. 656 (1940)). Given this delegation to a coordinate branch, \u201cour role is not to substitute our own preference for the optimal administrative procedure for the agency\u2019s determination of its internal rules.... Ignoring the BIA\u2019s determination of these issues would amount to a judicial determination that the Board acted <em>ultra vires </em>in following its own rules.\u201d <em>Sidabutar, </em>503 F.3d at 1120; <em>see McKart v. United States, </em>395 U.S. 185, 194, 89 S.Ct. 1657, 23 L.Ed.2d 194 (1969). It is well-established that agencies may waive compliance with their \u201cprocedural rules adopted for the orderly transaction of [agency] business.... \u201d <em>Colo. Envtl. Coal. v. Wenker, </em>353 F.3d 1221, 1228 (10th Cir.2004) (quoting <em>Am. Farm Lines v. Black Ball Freight, </em>397 U.S. 532, 538-39, 90 S.Ct. 1288, 25 L.Ed.2d 547 (1970)); <em>see Weinberger v. Salfi, </em>422 U.S. 749, 766-67, 95 S.Ct. 2457, 45 L.Ed.2d 522 (1975). As the BIA waived compliance with its specificity requirement by choosing to address Bin\u2019s petition on the merits, we may not now reject the petition for review based on that requirement. <em>See Angelus Milling Co. v. Comm\u2019r of Internal Revenue, </em>325 U.S. 293, 297, 65 S.Ct. 1162, 89 L.Ed. 1619 (1945) (\u201cIf the Commissioner chooses not to stand on his own formal or detailed requirements, it would be making an empty abstraction, and not a practical safeguard, of a regulation to allow the Commissioner to invoke technical objections after he has investigated the merits of a claim and taken action upon it\u201d); <em>Abdelqadar v. Gonzales, </em>413 F.3d 668, 670-71 (7th Cir.2005) (\u201cThe agency\u2019s assertion ... that failure to preserve an issue deprives us of subject-matter jurisdiction, so that we must ignore the agency\u2019s own forfeiture, lacks any visible means of support.\u201d); <em>Nat\u2019l Labor Relations Bd. v. Monsanto Chem. Co., </em>205 F.2d 763, 764 (8th Cir.1953).</p>\n<p id=\"b151-7\">Holding that the BIA waived its specificity requirement does not run counter to the purposes underlying the exhaustion doctrine. The Supreme Court has explained that \u201c[e]xhaustion is generally required as a matter of preventing premature interference with agency processes, ... [giving the agency] an opportunity to correct its own errors, to afford the parties and the courts the benefit of its experience and expertise, and to compile a record which is adequate for judicial review.\u201d <em>Salfi, </em>422 U.S. at 765, 95 S.Ct. 2457. While these are important concerns, \u201c[w]here the BIA has issued a decision considering the merits of an issue, even <em>sua sponte, </em>these interests have been fulfilled.\u201d <em>Sidabutar, </em>503 F.3d at 1121. The BIA has already had an opportunity to apply its experience and expertise without judicial interference. So too, the fact that the BIA has addressed the issue independently from the IJ ensures that the record is adequate for our review. Indeed, the <em>Sidabutar </em>court expressly limited the application of this rule to cases in which the BIA \u201cissues a full explanatory opinion or a discernible substantive discussion on the merits over matters not presented by the alien,\u201d distinguishing cases where \u201cthe BIA summarily affirms the IJ decision <em>in toto </em>without further analysis of the issue.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1122 (citing 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(e)(4)).</p>\n<p id=\"b152-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>While we need not specify the precise limitations of this rule here, we note that the BIA did issue a \u201cdiscernible substantive discussion on the merits\u201d in this case. <em>See id. </em>Rather than issuing a one-member streamlined opinion under 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003. 1(e)(4), the BIA considered Bin\u2019s case as a three-member panel. It cited to <em>Matter of Burbano, </em>20 I. &amp; N. Dec. 872, 874 (BIA 1994), indicating that it had conducted an independent review of the record and had exercised its own discretion in determining its agreement with the reasoning and result of the IJ. <em>See Paripovic v. Gonzales, </em>418 F.3d 240, 243 n. 4 (3d Cir.2005); <em>Arreguin-Moreno, </em>511 F.3d at 1232. In exercising its independent discretion, the BIA made clear that it agreed only with the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination, and not necessarily with the IJ\u2019s conclusions regarding the relevant standards for relief. Accordingly, exercising jurisdiction over Bin\u2019s petition for review would not prematurely interfere with the agency processes. The agency here had sufficient opportunity to correct its own errors and apply its expertise to the matter at hand. <em>See Sagermark v. I.N.S., </em>767 F.2d 645, 648 (9th Cir.1985) (\u201cWhether or not the decision on the merits was technically before the BIA, the BIA addressed it thoroughly enough to convince us that the relevant policy concerns underlying the exhaustion requirement ... have been satisfied here.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b152-4\">While we would usually hold that a petitioner\u2019s failure to present an issue to the BIA constituted a failure to exhaust, thus depriving us of jurisdiction to consider it, here the BIA <em>sua sponte </em>addressed and ruled on the unraised issue. In so doing the BIA waived, as it was entitled to do, its specificity requirement under 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.3(b). Because the BIA waived its specificity requirement and addressed the IJ\u2019s credibility determination on the merits, thereby exhausting the issue, we have jurisdiction to consider the petition for review. <em>See Sidabutar, </em>503 F.3d at 1120.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-6\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-7\">We now address the merits of Bin\u2019s appeal. Bin seeks a new credibility determination, claiming, among other things, that the IJ incorrectly identified two purported discrepancies between Bin\u2019s testimony and his written affidavit. We disagree with Bin\u2019s arguments and hold that substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s credibility determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-8\">The first inconsistency noted by the IJ was a discrepancy between Bin\u2019s written affidavit and his testimony before the IJ concerning the reasons given for his arrest in 1999. In his affidavit, Bin stated that \u201c[a]t the beginning of August in 1999[] five or six police officers suddenly showed up at my home. <em>They said that I practiced Falun Gong and believed the evil religion. </em>They told me that I was under arrest. I could not resist. As a result, I was taken to the police station.\u201d A.R. 339 (emphasis added). On direct examination, however, Bin stated- \u2014 and then repeated\u2014 that he was given no reason for the arrest, either at his house or at the police precinct. When given an opportunity to explain the contradiction, Bin merely replied that \u201c[w]ell, I forgot sometime even what I had written in my statement.\u201d A.R. 90. He added: \u201cI don\u2019t have a good memory in my mind and sometimes I would miss a few sentences that I have written in my statement.\u201d A.R. 90.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-9\">Bin\u2019s testimony simply cannot be reconciled with his affidavit. While Bin\u2019s affidavit stated that the arresting officers said that Bin practiced Falun Gong, Bin testified quite clearly that he was not given a reason for his arrest and that he was simply taken to the police precinct by force. Given Bin\u2019s differing positions con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>cerning the circumstances of his arrest, there was reason for the IJ to doubt Bin\u2019s credibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">Bin\u2019s attempt to explain the contradiction only exacerbated these doubts. In stating that he \u201cforgot sometime even what [he] had written in [his] statement,\u201d Bin seemed to be testifying not from his independent recollection of his purported arrest, but from his recollection of what he had written in the affidavit he prepared specifically to apply for asylum. In this regard, the inconsistency between Bin\u2019s testimony and affidavit created the perception that Bin manufactured a story to tell to the IJ.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">This discrepancy goes to the heart of Bin\u2019s asylum application. <em>See Gao v. Ashcroft, </em>299 F.3d 266, 272 (3d Cir.2002). Courts have recognized that \u201cattempts by the applicant to enhance his claims of persecution\u201d go to the heart of a petitioner\u2019s claim for relief. <em>Sarr v. Gonzales, </em>485 F.3d 354, 360 (6th Cir.2007); <em>Damaize-Job v. I.N.S., </em>787 F.2d 1332, 1337 (9th Cir.1986); <em>see also id. </em>(differentiating such bolstering attempts from \u201cminor discrepancies in dates that are attributable to the applicant\u2019s language problems or typographical errors\u201d). In this case, the IJ was not convinced that Bin was arrested at all, let alone for one of the statutorily-protected grounds necessary to be eligible for asylum and withholding of removal. Thus, a discrepancy concerning the very reason for Bin\u2019s arrest, that on the one hand would give rise to an asylum claim, or on the other hand would not, goes to the heart of Bin\u2019s claim for relief.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b153-9\">The second inconsistency relates to the manner in which Bin purportedly practiced Falun Gong after being released from detention in 1999 and before his subsequent arrest in 2004. Bin stated in his affidavit that, on occasion, he invited other Falun Gong practitioners to his parents\u2019 home to practice Falun Gong together. Before the IJ, however, Bin made clear that after 1999 he only practiced in his parents\u2019 house by himself. When asked about the discrepancy, Bin explained that \u201c[w]ell, I did write [that I invited other practitioners to my parents\u2019 house] in my statement so I presumefd] that you knew about it,\u201d and further, that he did not understand the questions asked of him. A.R. 88-89.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-10\">This inconsistency also goes to the heart of Bin\u2019s claim. Bin claims that he was arrested for practicing Falun Gong. If he was arrested for another reason, or not arrested at all, this would be fatal to his asylum claim. Thus, the location where Bin practiced Falun Gong is relevant in that it bears on how likely it was that the Chinese authorities knew of his Falun Gong activities. If he truly practiced secretly and alone in his home, as he told the IJ, it is hard to believe that the authorities could have found out about his practice of Falun Gong and persecuted him for that reason. Bin\u2019s inconsistent testimony on this central issue is thus material to Bin\u2019s claim for relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>This discrepancy is buttressed by the IJ\u2019s finding as to Bin\u2019s demeanor. When asked how it could be that, since he practiced secretly, the authorities came to learn he was practicing Falun Gong in 2004, Bin \u201cstuttered and was unable to provide a rational explanation....\u201d A.R. 50. We have noted that \u201c[a]n immigration judge alone is in a position to observe an alien\u2019s tone and demeanor\u201d and is \u201cuniquely qualified to decide whether an alien\u2019s testimony has about it the ring of truth.\u201d <em>Abdulrahman, </em>330 F.3d at 597; <em>see Dia v. Ashcroft, </em>353 F.3d 228, 249-50 (3d Cir.2003) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b154-4\">Given the inconsistencies relied on by the IJ and Bin\u2019s unpersuasive demeanor, we apply our deferential standard of review and hold that a reasonable adjudicator would not be compelled to conclude that Bin was credible. <em>See Abdulrahman, </em>330 F.3d at 599; <em>see also Tarrawally v. Ashcroft, </em>338 F.3d 180, 187 (3d Cir.2003) (noting that \u201calthough some minor discrepancies\u201d between petitioner\u2019s affidavit and testimony \u201cmight be understandable,\u201d petitioner\u2019s \u201cirreconcilable contradictory assertions\u201d supported the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination). The IJ provided \u201cspecific[,] cogent reasons\u201d for making the adverse credibility determination, <em>Dia, </em>353 F.3d at 249-50, and thus, we hold that the determination was supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-6\">For the foregoing reasons, we will deny the petition for review.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b143-6\">.

Bin's claims for relief antedate the change in law brought by the REAL ID Act of 2005. <em>See Kaita v. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>522 F.3d 288, 296 &amp; n. 6 (3d Cir.2008) (explaining that for claims filed after May 11, 2005, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 115 8(b)(l)(B)(ii) permits an IJ to make \"a credibility determination ... without regard to whether an inconsistency, inaccuracy, or falsehood goes to the heart of the applicant's claim\u201d) (quotation marks omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b146-4\">. Over the last several years, a number of our sister courts of appeals have struggled with \"the question whether the failure to raise an <em>issue </em>before the BIA is a jurisdictionally-fatal failure to exhaust an administrative <em>remedy </em>for purposes of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1), or simply raises the non-jurisdictional question whether review of that issue is precluded by the doctrine of administrative exhaustion.\u201d <em>Zine v. Mukasey, </em>517 F.3d 535, 539-40 (8th Cir.2008) (emphasis in original) (resolving the case on narrower grounds so as not to \"enter this thicket\u201d). For example, both the Courts of Appeals for the First and Eighth Circuits were \"very tempt[ed]\u201d to find that \u00a7 1252(d)(1) does not preclude a court of appeals from considering issues that an alien did not present to the agency. <em>See Sousa v.

While both courts ultimately found themselves bound by precedent to treat issue exhaustion as a jurisdictional requirement, it is not clear that they treated issue exhaustion as a \"truly jurisdictional\u201d requirement. <em>See Zhong v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>489 F.3d 126, 130 n. 6 (2d Cir.2007) (Calabres\u00ed, J., concurring in the denial of rehearing en banc) (noting that since the <em>Etchu-Njang </em>and <em>Sousa </em>courts contemplate exceptions to the \"jurisdictional\u201d issue exhaustion requirement, the requirement cannot be a \"truly jurisdictional\u201d one).</p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">Moreover, these cases were decided without consideration of a line of \"powerful statements\u201d by the Supreme Court \"that courts should be reluctant to make issues jurisdictional rather than mandatory unless statutory language requires it....\u201d <em>Zhong, </em>489 F.3d at 134 (Calabres\u00ed, J. concurring in the denial of rehearing en banc); <em>see, e.g., Arbaugh v.Y &amp; H Corp., </em>546 U.S. 500, 510-11, 126 S.Ct. 1235, 163 L.Ed.2d 1097 (2006) (noting that \"[jlurisdiction ... is a word of many, too many, meanings\u201d and that the Supreme Court, \"no less than other courts, has sometimes been profligate in its use of the term,\u201d but cautioning that \"unrefined dispositions ... should be accorded no precedential effect on the question whether the federal court had authority to adjudicate the claim in suit\u201d) (quotation marks omitted); <em>Kontrick v.

In light of the Supreme Court\u2019s repeated admonitions, the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit recently revisited its issue exhaustion jurisprudence and held that issue exhaustion is a mandatory, though not jurisdictional, rule. <em>See Zhong v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>480 F.3d 104, 107 (2d Cir.2007); <em>see also Korsunskiy v.

To add to the confusion, courts have taken related, but slightly different approaches to contentions such as Bin\u2019s. Some courts begin by addressing, as we have in Part A, whether the petitioner in fact raised the relevant claim or issue, thereby exhausting his or her administrative remedies. <em>See, e.g., Sidabutar v. Gonzales, </em>503 F.3d 1116, 1119 (10th Cir.2007). Other courts skip this first step and focus simply on the fact that the BIA addressed the issue, <em>sua sponte </em>or not. <em>See, e.g., Zine, </em>517 F.3d at 540.
