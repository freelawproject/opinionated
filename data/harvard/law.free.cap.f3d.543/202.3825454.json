The presentence report (PSR) assigned Pillado a base offense level of eight for violating \u00a7 1326. His base offense level was enhanced by 16 levels pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(i) because he had a prior 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 843(b) conviction for using a telephone to facilitate a conspiracy to distribute marijuana \u201cand/or\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>cocaine, a \u201cdrug trafficking offense.\u201d Pil-lado received three levels of credit for acceptance of responsibility, for a total offense level of 21. With a criminal history category of II, the advisory guidelines range was 41 to 51 months of imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-4\">Pillado argues that the district court erred in imposing a 16-level enhancement under \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(i) based on his \u00a7 843(b) conviction, contending that a \u00a7 843(b) conviction does not constitute a \u201cdrug trafficking offense\u201d under the guideline. We review de novo the district court\u2019s interpretation and application of the guideline. <em>United States v. Villegas, </em>404 F.3d 355, 359 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">Section 2L1.2 provides for a 16-level increase in the base offense level for defendants convicted of illegal reentry if the defendant has previously been convicted of \u201ca drug trafficking offense for which the sentence imposed exceeded 13 months.\u201d \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(i). \u201cDrug trafficking offense\u201d is defined as follows: \u201can offense under federal, state, or local law that prohibits the manufacture, import, export, distribution, or dispensing of a controlled substance ... or the possession of a controlled substance ... with intent to manufacture, import, export, distribute, or dispense.\u201d \u00a7 2L1.2, cmt. (n.l(B)(iv)).</p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">We employ the categorical approach set forth in <em>Taylor v. United States, </em>495 U.S. 575, 602, 110 S.Ct. 2143, 109 L.Ed.2d 607 (1990), to determine whether a prior conviction qualifies as a drug trafficking offense under \u00a7 2L1.2. <em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>523 F.3d 519, 524 (5th Cir.), <em>petition for cert. filed </em>(No. 08-5101) (June 30, 2008). In so doing, we look to the elements of the prior offense, rather than to the facts underlying the conviction. <em>Id. </em>If the statute of conviction contains multiple disjunctive sections which prohibit conduct that will support a sentence enhancement and other conduct that will not, we may look to, inter alia, the charging paper to determine which section applies to the defendant\u2019s conviction. <em>Id. </em>A court may not, however, look to the PSR\u2019s characterization of the offense to make its determination regarding the propriety of the enhancement. <em>United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 274 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b230-9\">The issue whether a \u00a7 843(b) conviction constitutes a drug trafficking offense under \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(i) is res nova in this circuit. The Eleventh Circuit was the first of four circuits to address the issue and hold that a prior conviction for use of a communication facility meets the definition of \u201cdrug trafficking offense\u201d and supports the 16-level enhancement in \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A). <em>See United States v. Orihuela, </em>320 F.3d 1302, 1305 (11th Cir.2003); <em>see also United States v. Jimenez, </em>533 F.3d. 1110, 1112-14 (9th Cir.2008); <em>United States v. Zuniga-Guerrero, </em>460 F.3d 733, 739 (6th Cir.2006), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 1011, 166 L.Ed.2d 762 (2007); <em>United States v. Duarte, </em>327 F.3d 206, 207 (2d Cir.2003). We find <em>Orihuela </em>persuasive and now join our sister circuits in holding that a \u00a7 843(b) conviction constitutes a \u201cdrug trafficking offense\u201d under \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(i).</p>\n<p id=\"b230-12\">In <em>Orihuela, </em>the court analogized the definition of \u201cdrug trafficking offense\u201d with the definition of \u201ccontrolled substance offense\u201d under the career criminal enhancement provision in \u00a7 4B1.2(b), noting that \u00a7 4B1.2(b) defines the term \u201ccontrolled substance offense\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> in substantially the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>same way as \u00a7 2L1.2 defines the term \u201cdrug trafficking offense\u201d and, thus, decisions interpreting \u00a7 4B 1.2(b) would therefore be analogous authorities. 320 F.3d at 1304; <em>see also United States v. Le, </em>512 F.3d 128, 135 &amp; n. 3 (5th Cir.2007) (recognizing that cases discussing \u00a7 4B1.2(b)\u2019s definition of \u201ccontrolled substance offense\u201d and \u00a7 2L1.2\u2019s definition of \u201cdrug trafficking offense\u201d are cited interchangeably because the language is identical), <em>petition for cert. filed </em>(No. 07-10662) (Apr. 28, 2008). The court noted that several circuits had recognized that telephone facilitation offenses were controlled substance offenses under \u00a7 4B1.2(b) and that the Sentencing Commission had codified these findings in U.S.S.G.App. C, Amend. No. 568 (1997). <em>Orihuela, </em>320 F.3d at 1304. It also determined that because a \u00a7 843(b) offense involves the facilitation of an underlying controlled substance offense, it results in the offender\u2019s aiding and abetting of the underlying offense, which thereby constitutes engaging in a controlled substance offense. <em>Id. </em>at 1304-05; <em>cf. United States v. Mankins, </em>135 F.3d 946, 949 (5th Cir.1998) (holding that an element of a \u00a7 843(b) offense is the defendant\u2019s commission of an independent drug crime or facilitation of such a crime). Pil-lado\u2019s indictment clearly charged that he facilitated the commission of an independent drug crime in violation of \u00a7 843(b). Accordingly, the district court\u2019s imposition of the 16-level enhancement was a proper interpretation and application of the Guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-4\">Pillado additionally argues, for the first time on appeal, that in applying the enhancement, the district court erred in adopting the probation officer\u2019s response to his sentencing objection and, additionally, that the district court erred in relying on the indictment and PSR as factual bases for the enhancement. Review of these arguments is for plain error only. <em>United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 520 (5th Cir.2005). The facts charged in the applicable paragraph of the indictment are plainly sufficient to support the enhancement; that Pillado facilitated the commission of an independent drug crime, conspiracy to distribute marijuana and cocaine. <em>See Mankins, </em>135 F.3d at 949. He has therefore shown no error on the part of the district court in this regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-9\">Pillado also has not shown that the district court plainly erred in adopting the probation officer\u2019s response to his sentencing objection, which response analogized the definition of \u201cdrug trafficking offense\u201d in \u00a7 2L1.2 with the definition of \u201ccontrolled substance offense\u201d in \u00a7 4B1.2(b). As previously discussed, \u00a7 4B1.2(b)\u2019s definition of \u201ccontrolled substance offense\u201d is the same language used in the definition of \u201cdrug trafficking offense\u201d under \u00a7 2L1.2, cmt. (n.l(B)(iv)), and, therefore, cases discussing these definitions are cited interchangeably. <em>See Le, </em>512 F.3d at 135 &amp; n. 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-10\">To the extent that the district court relied on the PSR in support of the enhancement, such reliance constituted error. Ga<em>rza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d at 274. Nevertheless, because the indictment alone provided a sufficient basis for the enhancement, the error did not affect Pillado\u2019s substantial rights because he suffered no prejudice therefrom. Therefore, he has not demonstrated reversible plain error. <em>See Mares, </em>402 F.3d at 520-21.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is</p>\n<p id=\"b232-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b230-7\">.
