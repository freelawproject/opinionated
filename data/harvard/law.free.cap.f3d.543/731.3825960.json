He argues that the district court reversibly erred by imposing a 16-level increase to his base offense level based upon its determination that his prior Texas conviction for burglary of a habitation constituted a crime of violence.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-24\">As Cardenas-Cardenas acknowledges, a panel of this court previously held that a violation of Tex. Penal Code ANN. \u00a7 30.02(a)(1), the statute pertaining to his prior burglary conviction, is a crime of violence for purposes of \u00a7 2L1.2 because it is equivalent to the enumerated offense of burglary of a dwelling. <em>See United States v. Garcia-Mendez, </em>420 F.3d 454, 456-57 (5th Cir.2005); <em>see also </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2, comment n.l(B)(iii). Nevertheless, Cardenas-Cardenas argues that the Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in <em>James v. United States, </em>550 U.S. 192, 127 S.Ct. 1586, 1599-1600, 167 L.Ed.2d 532 (2007), overrules this circuit\u2019s precedent. We disagree and determine that this argument is, as Cardenas-Cardenas concedes, foreclosed.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-25\">In <em>James, </em>the Supreme Court noted in dicta that because the Florida burglary statute at issue in that case criminalized the mere unlawful entry onto the curtilage of a structure, rather than entry into the structure itself, the statute contemplates conduct beyond generic burglary. <em>Id. </em>at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"732\">*732</page-number>1599. This, however, was not the holding of <em>James, </em>which did not present the issue whether burglary in Florida constitutes an enumerated offense that could be used to impose a guidelines sentencing adjustment under 2L1.2. Rather, <em>James </em>raised the question whether a Florida burglary conviction was a violent felony for purposes of the Armed Career Criminal Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e). <em>Id. </em>at 1590; <em>see also United States v. Gomez-Guerra, </em>485 F.3d 301, 303 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>-U.S.-, 128 S.Ct. 156, 169 L.Ed.2d 106 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b758-6\">Cardenas-Cardenas\u2019s argument is unavailing even under the <em>James </em>dicta. In contrast to Florida\u2019s burglary statute, \u201chabitation\u201d under \u00a7 30.02(a)(1) does not include the curtilage surrounding the habitable structure. <em>See \u00a7 </em>30.01(1); <em>St. Julian v. State, </em>874 S.W.2d 669, 671 (Tex.Crim.App.1994). Consequently, <em>James </em>does not undermine our conclusions in <em>Garcidr-Mendez </em>that a violation of \u00a7 30.02(a)(1) constitutes \u201cburglary of a dwelling\u201d as that phrase is generically used and, concomitantly, that a conviction under that statute will support a sentencing adjustment under \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b758-7\">Cardenas-Cardenas has shown no error in connection with his sentence. Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
