The record, however, shows the following, and amply supports the finding of the court: That when the plans were completed for the construction of the building as originally designed, a bid was received for the erection of the building at a cost of $55,000, The record shows that after this bid was received a number of changes were made at the request of the defendants, and bids again called for, and, as herein stated, the lowest bid for the erection of the building was $68,000. Following the receipt of this bid the defendants eliminated from the building a number of items relating to the upper stories thereof, and then, using the same plans, obtained the construction of the building for the sum of $39,000. Based upon this record the court found that the plaintiff was entitled to this compensation at the rate of five per cent upon the cost of the building, that being the rate contemplated in the contract where it provides \u201cthat payment will be made per schedule of the American Society of Architects.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b108-6\">While the law is well settled that where the agreement provides for a building not to cost more than a certain sum, the architect is not entitled to compensation under a contract such as was signed by the parties in this case, it also seems to be pretty well settled that if, after the plans are drawn as contemplated by the parties in the first instance, they are so changed by the owners as to increase the cost of the building, the architect is entitled to compensation. (5 C. J., p. 262; <em>Benenato </em>v. <em>McDougall, </em>166 Cal. 405 [Ann. Cas. 1915C, 871, 49 L. R. A. (N. S.) 1202, 137 Pac. 8].)</p>\n<p id=\"b108-7\">The final objection of appellants is based upon the omnibus finding hereinbefore set forth, the contention being that it is impossible to ascertain what allegations in the plaintiff\u2019s complaint are inconsistent or consistent with the findings, and also, what denials in the answer filed by the defendants are, or are not consistent, with the findings. If this were the only finding made by the trial court, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>appellants\u2019 contention would be well founded. The trial court, however, having found all that was necessary to sustain the judgment, the omnibus finding may be disregarded. This is amply shown by the opinion of the supreme court in the case of <em>Turner </em>v. <em>Turner, </em>187 Cal. 632 [203 Pac. 109]; and the cases cited on page 635 of the same volume.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">Finding no merit whatever in the defendants\u2019 appeal, the judgment of the trial court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-6\">Hart, J., and Finch, P. J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
