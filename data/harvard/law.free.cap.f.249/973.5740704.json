Tatum, 189 Fed'. 357, 111 O. C. A. 279, because, though it is not a literal copy of the patented design, the differences are such as might escape the notice of any but a close observer. They consist only of the bead around the honeycomb and the straight line at the top. The question of validity, therefore, necessarily arises.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b987-20\">I agree that the exact combination nowhere appears, and invention depends, therefore, upon the changes necessary to produce the design out oi, tho prior art. The general oval appearance of the radiator, when viewed in elevation and from the front, is disclosed in the F.A.B., the Fafnir, the Hansa, the Opel, the Oryx, and the Zedel, all disclosed in the periodical. The Autocar, of March 22, 1913. Some of these have a straight line at the top, like tho defendant\u2019s; some do not; hut the distinctions between them in appearance are not such as constitute invention. The same applies also to the Ilorch, as shown in the German periodical, Motor, of January, 1913, and the French Omnia, of November 16, 1912; to the Opel, in La Vie Automobile, Volume X, 1911, page 170; to the Oryx, in the German Motor, March, 1913, and to the Hansa, in the Autocar, June 29, 1912, page 1188. No variation in front elevation can be monopolized.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b987-21\">Tlie curved top ol' the radiator when viewed in section, is clearly shown on the Peugeot, in The Automobile, volme XXVII, 1912, page 9M, and in The Motor, April 15, 1913; on the Austrian-Daimler, in La Vie Automobile, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"974\">*974</page-number>volume II, 1911, page 757, on the Loreley, in Der Motorwagen, June 30, 1914, page 429; on the Horch, in the citations above given; and on, the Hansa. It is quite true that the Horch, Hansa, and Loreley have a projected brow or cowl, which protrudes beyond the \u201choneycomb\u201d of the radiator proper; but this is not true of the Peugeot, nor of the Austrian-Daimler. Moreover, I do not distinguish between a true curve in section and a generally receding section, though in broken lines, as on Mathis, in La Vie Automobile, volume II, 1911, page 405.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b988-4\"><bracketnum>[1, 2]</bracketnum> The test of invention in design patents is precisely like that in mechanical (Steffens v. Steiner, 232 Fed. 862, 147 C. C. A. 56), and the question is whether it was beyond the powers of the ordinary designer to combine the oval elevation with the curved top in section or to compress the projecting brow or cowl, from Horch, Hansa, or Loreley, either of which adaptations would produce the defendant\u2019s radiator. There were 165 designs shown in the cited number of The Autocar alone and this number was probably not exhaustive. While I agree that such a number would bespeak unusual artistic skill in any substantially new or strikingly beautiful design, it seems to me to forbid the conclusion that mere variants upon the elements already disclosed, entitle one to a monopoly of any given form. There is no such striking beauty in the design of the patent, over the other such closely similar designs as Horch or the Austrian-Daimler as was beyond the most commonplace talents; none that justifies a monopoly, or requires a reward.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b988-5\">The bill is dismissed, with costs, for lack of invention in the patent.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b988-6\">Edwards, Sager &amp; Richmond, of New York City (Clifton V.
