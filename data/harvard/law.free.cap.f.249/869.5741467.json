The petition alleged that Quok Shoo was unlawfully imprisoned and restrained of her liberty by the Commissioner of Immigration; that on May 15, 191,5, the petitioner, who had been a Chinese merchant lawfully domiciled in San Francisco for more than 20 years, departed for China on a temporary visit, and was there married to Quok Shee, and that in company with his wife he returned to Sau Francisco on September 1, 1916; that a hearing was had before the inspector, who reported favorably on Quok Shoe\u2019s application for admission to the United States as the wife of the petitioner, but that thereafter the Commissioner ordered a re-examination, the result of which was that Quok Sheo\u2019s application was denied; and that upon her appeal from that decision, the Secretary of Labor ordered that she be deported. The petition alleged that the hearing was unfair, in that, after the appeal had been taken, the attorneys for Quok Shee were denied the privilege of interviewing her for the purpose of introducing further evidence in support of her appeal; also that in the records of the immigration authorities it appears that tlieir decision was influenced by a confidential communication which they luid received in reference to the right of Quok Shee to admission into the United States,,, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"870\">*870</page-number>which confidential information was forwarded to the Commissioner of Labor, to be considered on the appeal, as is shown from the following extract: \u201cThis is one of the three cases in which the department received apparently authentic confidential information going to show that the women involved, were being brought to this country for immoral purposes.\u201d And the petitioner alleged upon information and belief that the immigration authorities decided his wife\u2019s application for admission to the United States adversely by reason of such confidential information, which was hot permitted <em>to </em>be of record, and was not known to the petitioner, or Quok Shee, or her attorneys.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b884-4\">Dion R.

Mah Shee v. White, 242 Fed. 868, 155 C. C. A. 456. Aside from that, we hold that the fact that the immigration authorities received a confidential communication concerning the applicant\u2019s right to admission, upon which they acted, and which was forwarded to the Department of Labor for its consideration, was sufficient to constitute the hearing unfair. However far the hearing on the application of an alien for admission into the United States may depart from what in judicial proceedings is deemed necessary to constitute due process of law, there clearly is no warrant for basing decision, in whole or in part, -on confidential communications, the source, motive, or contents of which are not disclosed to the applicant or her counsel, and where no opportunity is afforded them to cross-examine, or to offer testimony in rebuttal thereof, or even to know that such communication .has been received.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-8\">The judgment is reversed, and the cause is remanded, with instructions to issue the writ.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
