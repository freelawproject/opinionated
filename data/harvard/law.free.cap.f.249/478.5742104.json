The specification is for an \u201cornamental electric lighting fixture,\u201d comprising a \u201cbell-shaped canopy having a straight lower edge,\u201d below which is suspended in close proximity \u201ca hemispherical bowl having a straight upper edge.\u201d The claim is for the fixture \u201csubstantially as shown and described.\u201d The drawing adds nothing to the above description, except that it shows the \u201ccanopy\u201d as having six equidistant ribs, which (for all that is disclosed) might be either integral with the material of the fixture, or functionally a skeleton or framing into which the material is inserted or built. On October 12, 1915, the same patentee obtained a mechanical patent (1,156,-454) for an \u201cimprovement in electric lighting fixtures,\u201d claiming such fixture \u201chaving a shade and a dish; the shade being formed of a plurality of panels formed of glass\u201d secured together by ribs, with top and bottom binding chari<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>uels, each of them being \u201ca flat ring with inclined walls,\u201d in conjunction with \u2022\u2018moans for securing the ribs to the channels and for connecting the dish to the shade.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b493-3\">The evidence shows that plaintiff called this fixture the \u201cEqualite,\u201d and sold it with success; witnesses testifying that the \u201clight * * \u00ae was pleasing to the aesthetic emotions [and! it acquired distinctiveness and individuality among the trade.\u201d Comparing the drawing of the mechanical patent, as explained in its specification, with the drawing of the patent in suit, it is plain that both draftsmen had before them a single device, that the ribs of both drawings are the same, that said x-ibs have a mechanical purpose, and, in short, that the design patented is the contour shown in vertical section of the \u201cshade and dish\u201d of the mechanical improvement, though for design purposes the words \u201ccanopy and hemispherical howl\u201d are substituted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b493-4\">The trial court found infringement, but denied an accounting, for reasons here immaterial. A final decree having therefore issued, defendant took this appeal.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b493-5\">John L. Lotsch and Isaac Steinhaus, both of New York City, for appellants.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b493-6\">Lester F. Dittenhoefer, of New York City (Dodson &amp; Roe, of New York City, of counsel), for appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b493-7\">Before WARD, ROGERS, and HOUGH, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b493-8\">HOUGH, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"ANh\">(after stating the -facts as above). Error is alleged in that the patent in suit was not held anticipated by the earlier grant to the same patentee for a mechanical improvement.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-9\"><bracketnum>[1]</bracketnum> If the same man at the same time devises a container of pleasing design and a mechanical contrivance conveniently united with the aesthetic covering, he has made two inventions; and, though he patents one, that is no reason why within the statutory two years he may not patent the other. Such act would not be necessarily a case of double patenting, which is always unlawful. The question is unaffected by the accident that one of the two compared patents is for a design and the other for a mechanical arrangement of matter; and it is always the same, viz.: Is the same thing or inventive thought disclosed by both? Williams, etc., Co. v. Neverslip, etc., Co. (C. C.) 136 Fed. 210; President, etc., Co. v. Macwilliam (D. C.) 233 Fed. 439.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-10\">The \u201cshade and dish\u201d of the mechanical patent were shown as of the design shape but that shape was neither part of the invention nor essential to its operation or success; whatever merit that improvement possessed depended on the construction and mechanical interrelation of parts, which might just as well have been conical or polygonal, as hell-shaped or hemispherical. But the design patent covers nothing but the shape and effect thereof upon the eye of the particularly shown form of \u201ccanopy and bowl.\u201d Therefore there was no double patenting; and, as the later patent was applied for within two years after the earlier, the question whether, regarded as a publication, the first specification left no room for patentable invention in the second, is not before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-11\"><bracketnum>[2,3]</bracketnum> There are, however, other design patents issued to other inventors, relating to the shapes of canopies and bowls for electric lights, and antedating the one in suit, which, in our opinion prevent the discovery of any invention in the patent at bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>It is urged in support of the decree below that <em>the </em>novelty of a design is to be tested as a whole and that invention is persuasively shown by the commercial success of \u201cEqualite.\u201d Undoubtedly a design must be viewed in its entirety, its effect is optical, and it can no more be tested piecemeal than can a picture (Dobson v. Dornan, 118 U. S. 10, 6 Sup. Ct. 946, 30 L. Ed. 63); but novelty is not invention, nor can aid be found in the sales of \u201cEqualite.\u201d That word covers the light and the fitting thereof, all the material as fastened together; and the evidence wholly fails to show whether success is due to the mechanical excellence of the whole article, or the pleasing shape of its \u201ccanopy and bowl,\u201d which (as shown above) has no necessary connection with the mechanics of the contrivance. To ascertain whether it required invention to conceive and produce a plainly ribbed bell-shaped canopy proximately surmounting a hemispherical bowl, we have considered the design patents below noted,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and applied rules of decision often and lately stated by this court<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-4\">Finding no invention, it is ordered that the decree appealed from be reversed, and the case remanded, with directions to dismiss the bill, with costs in both courts.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b494-5\"> Grant, 45,629; Raymond, 48,082; and Pickhardt, 47,934 \u2014 left no room for this invention in bell-shaped ribbed canopies with or without hemispherical bowls. The kind of mental operation involved, is well- shown by the slightly later applications of the same patentee (49,567 and 49,558) shouting canopies of hexagonal and circular horizontal section respectively. There would seem to be no difficulty in patenting one design for every figure of plane geometry.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b494-6\"> Baker, etc., Co. v.
