N\u00ab application for dL.charge was filed within the period of 12 mouths subsequent to adjudication. On April 20 1917, 12 days after the expiration of the 12 months\u2019 period, (lie District Court entered an order allowing the bankrupt to file; instanter ills petition lor discharge, which he did. Afterwards, ami on May 19, 1917, the bankrupt filed, nunc pro tunc as of April 20, \u00cd9I7, his lurcher verified petition for leave to file his petition for discharge, setting out the grounds. Vrom that petition it appears that bankrupt iustrucied his attorney to procure ids discharge as soon as it could be done, and \u00a1\u2019'died wiiolly upon the attorney to secure it; that from time to time he consulted Ids attorney on the matter. and was assured by him that he would ,'ilond to the matron; ihai for the 3 month;; next preceding the last day for filing his application for discharge his said attorney was sick, and for about a month of that time in a sanitarium at Battle Creek, Mich.; tiiat owing to the situation, and to the bankrupt\u2019s reliance upon his attorney\u2019s promises aforesaid, together with the attorney\u2019s said illness, the bankrupt was unavoidably prevented from filing his petition for discharge within the statutory period. The petition thereupon prays for an extension of time to tile the same. No new order was entered after the filing of the nunc pro tunc petition. 'Hie order extending the time and granting leave to file his application was entered without notice to any one.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b202-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>From the petition to review and revise it appears that at the time adjudication was had there was pending in the superior court of Cook county, 111., a suit brought by the petitioner herein against said bankrupt, in which the summons had been duly served, which was suspended by the filing of his voluntary petition in bankruptcy; that after the lapse of the 12 months succeeding his adjudication as a bankrupt, and on April 16, 1917, pi aintiff in that case, petitioner herein, proceeded to judgment in said cause by default, for the sum of $5,555.15. Thereafter, when the bankrupt sought to ascertain why judgment was entered notwithstanding the bankruptcy proceedings, he was advised by petitioner\u2019s attorney that his (Waller\u2019s) time in which to file his application for discharge had expired. On April 20, 1917, the bankrupt advised the attorney for the petitioner of the order obtained that day for an extension of time to file his application. The petition herein to review sets out, further, that on April SO, 1917, the petitioner presented to the District Court its motion to vacate the order entered on April 20, 1917, extending the time to apply for discharge and granting other relief, together with an affidavit in support thereof, which motion was duly postponed to May 12, 1917, and on that date denied; that the notices, petitions, motions, and orders are all the motions, petitions, notices, steps, papers, and orders filed in said cause having any bearing on or p\u00e9rtaining to said petition for discharge. This affidavit purports to enumerate what evidence was before the court on the hearing of the motion to vacate.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b202-4\">The petition herein is brought to review and revise the order of May 12, 1917, overruling and denying said motion to vacate.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b202-5\">G.

We are unable to find from the petition herein that all the matters which were before the District Court have been here produced. Moreover, we are of the opinion that the order of the District Court should stand for other reasons. Section 14a of the Bankruptcy Act here involved reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-9\">\u201cAny person may, after the expiration of one month and within the next twelve months subsequent to being adjudged a bankrupt, file an application for a dischdrge in the court of bankruptcy in which the proceedings are pending; if it shall be made to appear to the judge that the bankrupt was unavoidably prevented from filing it within such time, it may be filed within hut not after the expiration of the next six months.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b202-10\">The motion to enlarge the time to file the application for discharge at any time before the expiration of the 18 months\u2019 period is one addressed to the reasonable discretion of the court. In re Fritz (D. C.) 173 Fed. 560; In re Chase (D. C.) 186 Fed. 408; In re Churchill (D. C.) 197 Fed. 111; In re Swain (D. C.) 243 Fed. 781.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-11\">In the present case we are unable to say that the District Judge abused that discretion or exceeded his powers. The Bankruptcy Act. was passed, among other things, to ameliorate the condition of certain debtors and for a benevolent purpose, and should not be harshly construed. In the case at bar it was not obligatory upon the bankrupt or his attorney to have made application for a discharge at some time prior to th\u00e9 last three months of the year succeeding the adjudication in order to escape the charge of negligence. He is chargeable.<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>with only reasonable diligence in that respect, and might well assume that the application for discharge could be safely left till towards the end of the 12 months\u2019 period, and may claim the benefit of such unavoidable causes as excuse the failure to apply for discharge within the 12 months arising at any time prior to the expiration of the 12 months\u2019 period succeeding adjudication. The rule is well stated by Judge Geiger in In re Churchill, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-4\">The motion to review and revise is denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
