Defendants in each 'case demurred to the petition, which in each instance resulted in the filing of an amended petition, the sums of money sought to be recovered and the defendants remaining the same; the allegations of the amended petitions were in other respects substantially alike. It is charged that Lowes, doing business as a general contractor under the name of Luyster &amp; Lowes, was 'by the court below adjudged &gt;a bankrupt December 11, 19ll; that plaintiff was appointed trustee December 27th, and is still acting in that capacity; that Lowes was indebted to these bunks in the sums above mentioned, and that Schaeffer, who is the father-in-law of the bankrupt, had been in charge of the bankrupt\u2019s' offices and business in Dayton, and had become surety for the bankrupt on his indebtedness to these banks; that on dates named within the four-months period the bankrupt, well knowing that he was insolvent and with intent to prefer the defendant banks and Schaeffer, as creditors, and in violation of the Bankruptcy Act, withdrew from his funds and through Schaeffer paid the sums stated to the several banks; that the banks and Schaeffer then had reason to believe that Lowes was insolvent, and that the payments were so made for.the purpose of preferring defendants as his creditors; further, in substance, that these payments were made pursuant to an agreement and a conspiracy between Lowes and Schaeffer and the several banks to deprive the bankrupt\u2019s other creditors of power to collect their claims, and so to appropriate the bankrupt\u2019s assets to the payment of the obligations of Lowes and Schaeffer to the banks.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b669-4\">Issue was joined in each case by separate answers of the defendants, specifically denying each of the allegations tending to charge a preference. May 4, 1915, the causes were brought to a hearing together under an agreement to waive a jury and to try them to the court. The plaintiff called as witnesses only Lowes and Schaeffer and W. W. Smart, the bookkeeper of Luyster &amp; Lowes, and submitted exhibits showing creditors other than the banks, who had not been paid in full, and the sums due to them, etc. At the close of the plaintiff\u2019s evidence motions wore made to dismiss the actions as against the banks, on the ground that there was no testimony to sustain the alleged \u201cscheme or conspiracy, or any intent, or knowledge on the part of the banks as to the condition of Mr. Lowes at any time.\u201d The motions were not resisted on the part of plaintiff, and were sustained. The cases were brought to this court, both upon appeals and writs of error.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b669-5\">O. E.

The appeals will therefore be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-4\"><bracketnum>[2, 3]</bracketnum> In the agreement to waive a jury and to try the issues to the court, it was provided that in deciding each case the court should state its findings of fact.and conclusions of law, and this was in effect carried out. The cases, however, each turned at last upon the issue whether, at the times the payments- in dispute were made to the banks Schaeffer knew or had reasonable cause to believe that Lowes was insolvent; and the ultimate fact found in substance was that Schaeffer did not have such knowledge or any reason for such belief. We are disposed to treat this as a special finding, though, whether general or special, it has the effect of the verdict of a jury. Hence the only inquiries open in this court under the assignments of error are whether the evidence tends to' support the ultimate finding and the finding in turn is sufficient to sustain the respective judgments. This results alike from the statutes and the decisions. -Sections 649, 700, and 1011, Rev. Stat. (Comp. St. 1916, \u00a7\u00a7 1587, 1668, 1672); Norris v. Jackson, 76 U. S. 125, 127, 19 L.

A. 9).</p>\n<p id=\"b670-5\"><bracketnum>[4]</bracketnum> It cannot be doubted that there is evidence tending to support the ultimate finding. The finding rests upon the credibility of the witnesses, especially that of Schaeffer, all of whom testified in open court. Upon most careful consideration of Schaeffer\u2019s testimony, particularly in connection with his demeanor and candor while testifying, the trial judge believed him. It is .virtually conceded that, if Schaeffer\u2019s testimony at the hearing below is to be believed, the finding is,correct; in these circumstances we are bound to conclude, as we should be in respect of, a special verdict of a jury, that the trial judge\u2019s finding is supported by the evidence. And we approve his conclusion of law that the fact so found is plainly sufficient to- support the several judgments.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-6\"><bracketnum>[5]</bracketnum> It is, however, earnestly insisted on behalf of plaintiff that evidence has been discovered since the judgments were entered which in itself would justify; if not require, reversals. This claim and part of the evidence so discovered appear only in- plaintiff\u2019s reply brief, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>though they were discussed in the oral argument here. The most obvious answer to the contention is that in such circumstances we have no power to reverse, since in actions at law this court can only correct errors of the court below; and it is not pretended that the claim of newly discovered evidence has ever been called to the attention of that court. The general rule of course is, as was stated in Mexico International Land Co. v. Larkin, 195 Fed. 495, 496, 115 C. C. A. 405, 406 (C. C. A. 8):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b671-4\">\u201cIn an action at law the lmrclen is on the plaintiff in error to establish the existence o\u00a3 those errors of which he complains, and in the absence of proof by the record that a question of law arose, and that it was presented to and ruled upon by the court below, no error is established, because none could arise concerning a question which was not presented, considered, or decided by the trial court. Southern Pacific Company v. Arnett, 126 Fed. 75, 77 [61 C. O. A. 131],\u201d and citations.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b671-5\"><bracketnum>[6, 7]</bracketnum> Assuming, however, that where matters arising after proceedings in error have been perfected may justly call for resuhmission to the trial court, reversal for that purpose would be warranted, still, apart from the question of plaintiff\u2019s lack of diligence as urged in defendant\u2019s behalf, in our judgment the evidence so far as shown or indicated is not material. Copies of six letters are shown, bearing dates in October and November, 1911, all addressed to creditors of Lowes, one located in Cincinnati (to whom two of the letters were sent), one in Indianapolis, one in St. Louis, and two in Dayton, and representing claims amounting to $24,226.50; upwards of $18,000 of this amount was held by the two Dayton creditors; and all the letters were signed in the name of Luyster &amp; Lowes, while only one seems to have been so signed by Schaeffer. True, they contain explanations for delaying payment of these creditors, but they do not appear to relate to the real sources of Lowes\u2019 financial troubles. Those troubles mainly arose through failure to ascertain and meet liabilities due to subcontractors and materialmen connected with Lowes\u2019 government work at Ft. Sill, Okl., and with his work on a public building in Mercer county, Pa. These features were abundantly explained by the trial judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-6\">Counsel say in their reply brief that they found many letters, at least 100, written by Schaeffer, and, further, that this correspondence \u201cis along the line of his letters heretofore made a part of this brief.\u201d We cannot think that letters along the same line as those copied into the brief are inconsistent with the explanations made by Schaeffer in his last testimony. It is quite conceivable that he might have written many letters, stating reasons for Lowes\u2019 delays in meeting payments, and still have been totally ignorant of Lowes\u2019 real financial condition at the times the payments in dispute were made to the banks. Hence we are not impressed with the insistence of counsel that reversals of the judgments would lead to different results. The difficulty with these cases is that plaintiff has been under the burden of proving his charges, and he has not done this; nor does the evidence proffered afford any siTbstantial ground for believing that he can do so. Judgments cannot be founded on suspicion.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-7\">The judgments will be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
