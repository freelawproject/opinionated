Jarmulowsky\u2019s Bank. The petitions of L. M. Wilson and Benjamin Bortz, which were opposed by Eugene Lamb Richards, as receiver in bankruptcy, were granted (243 Eed. 632), and the receiver petitions to revise.</summary>\n<disposition data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"disposition\" id=\"AqRk\">Affirmed.</disposition>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b334-7\">The appellant in these causes, Mr. Richards, is at once superintendent of banks for the state of New York and receiver in bankruptcy of Jarmulowsky \u2022et al., who conducted business in New York City as bankers under the name of \u201cS. Jarmulowsky\u2019s Bank.\u201d Pending these appeals adjudication has been entered, and for all practical purposes Mr. Richards may be regarded as the \u25a0trustee in bankruptcy. On May 11, 1917, the superintendent of banks took possession of Jarmulowsky\u2019s Bank pursuant to the statutes of New York, because in his opinion there existed an impairment of capital and an insufficient reserve. On the same day a petition in bankruptcy was filed against the Jarmulowsky s.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b334-8\">Quite as much from the admissions or statements of the parties as from a meager and ill-prepared record, we find that on May 10, 1917, Bortz deposited in the bank two checks, aggregating $304.90. One of these was plainly an out of town check; the other was apparently local \u2014 i. e., drawn against some bank in the city of New York. On the same May 10th Wilson similarly deposited two Philadelphia \u25a0 checks, aggregating $354. Both depositors indorsed their checks in blank and received credit (i. e., the checks were not entered \u201cshort\u201d) in their passbooks for the face of the checks, and both their passbooks contained the following notice: \u201cDeposits of currency or coin may be drawn against after deposit, but deposits of checks shall not be drawn against until collected.\u201d The checks aforesaid, with many others, were by the Jarmulowskys redeposited to their own account in sundry chartered banks of this city, and all were in time duly collected; but (as is admitted) such collection had not been made when Mr. Richards, at the opening of business on May 11th, took possession of the bankrupts\u2019 bank.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b334-9\">The receiver introduced evidence to the effect that Bortz had a so-called \u201ccommercial\u201d account with Jarmulowsky, and that as a depositor of that kind he had been permitted to draw against uncollected checks, notwithstanding the passbook notice aforesaid. As to Wilson, he introduced no such evidence. There is no other difference between the two causes; it being admitted that both as to Bortz and Wilson it was understood that the bank had perfect right to summarily charge back and against the depositor\u2019s account any check not collected on presentation, notwithstanding the apparent credit of the passbook or the privilege extended to commercial depositors like Bortz.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b334-10\">On these facts and admissions the'District Court entered orders requiring Mr. Richards, as receiver, to pay over to the petitioners, respectively, what he had received out of the check collections above described, and thereupon the receiver took these appeals.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b335-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>Koenig, Goldsmith &amp; Sittenfield, of New York City (Milton M.

Railroad Co. v. National Bank, 102 U. S. 14, 26 L. Ed. 61, reaffirming Swift v. Tyson, 16 Pet. 1, 10 L. Ed. 865.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-7\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> In the absence of any special agreement between these depositors and their bank, the title to the checks would have passed to the bank, and the bank become merely a debtor to the depositor for the amount entered in the passbook. Burton v. United States, 196 U. S. 297, 25 Sup. Ct. 243, 49 L. Ed. 482, approving Cragie v. Hadley, 99 N. Y. 131, 1 N. E. 537, 52 Am. Rep. 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-8\"><bracketnum>[3 -6]</bracketnum> Whether there was any other or special agreement made is a question of fact. St. Louis &amp; San Francisco R. R. Co. v. Johnston, 133 U. S. 566, 10 Sup. Ct. 390, 33 L. Ed. 683. On the facts above stated the evidence making for an absolute ownership of the checks by the bankrupts is the entry of full credit in the passbook and the fact that the depositors indorsed in blank; but it is to be noted, as they did not indorse either, \u201cFor deposit\u201d or \u201cFor collection,\u201d nor indorse specially, the Jarmulowskys might have written any lawful direction over the unrestricted signatures of the depositors. It is said, also, that in the case of Bortz the privilege of checking against such deposits as the one in question tends to show that the bankrupts became the absolute owners of the checks. On the other hand is the notice in the passbook which undoubtedly constituted part of the original contract between banker and depositor.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-9\">We regard the fact that the depositors\u2019 indorsements were in blank of no importance, since any indorsement (at least) consistent with the original intent of the parties might have been written there-over. Nor do we think the privilege said to have been extended to \u201ccommercial\u201d depositors like Bortz affords any guide to decision. It was a privilege, a favor, without consideration; it could have been retracted at any lime, and cannot, therefore, be held to show any change in the legal relation assumed by the parties when petitioners became depositors in bankrupts\u2019 institution.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-10\">Therefore both of these proceedings present the same question, which is whether a depositor who is credited with the face of checks, which he has agreed not to draw against until they shall have been collected, has by the act of deposit parted with the title to the checks in question or other such negotiable paper. It is obvious (and is indeed admitted) that unless there was such parting with title the relation of the bank to the depositor in respect of such collectible items is that of agent. Of course, if the agency had been fulfilled by collection of the checks be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>fore May 11th, no such question could be presented, for the moment the bank got money on the checks the relation of debtor and creditor arose. Goshorn v. Murray, 210 Fed. 880, 127 C. C. A. 464.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-4\">But here, when petition was filed and the bank superintendent took possession, the agency (if it existed) was terminated before collection effected, and the depositors can follow their own property or its proceeds wherever they can find it, in the absence of supervening superior rights. If these petitioners had indorsed their checks \u201cFor deposit\u201d and received full credit therefor, the decision of Putnam, J., in Beal v. City of Somerville, 50 Fed. 647, 1 C. C. A. 598, 17 L. R. A. 291, would entirely cover the case. And it is our opinion that what the parties, here meant was to create as to everything but cash the relation of principal and agent. This inference we draw from these undisputed facts: No depositor had any right (as distinct from an occasional and gratuitous privilege) to draw against anything but cash; this arrangement was advantageous to the hank; and the right to summarily charge back uncollected items, even after full apparent credit on deposit, is thought inconsistent with any intent on the bank\u2019s part to become the owner of such items as those under consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">We conclude, therefore, that the course of business shown herein is in effect the same as though the checks aforesaid had been specifically indorsed \u201cFor collection and deposit to the account of\u201d the depositors. If this had been done, the situation would be too clear for argument. See Morse on Banking (5th Ed.) \u00a7 587.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-6\">The orders appealed from are therefore affirmed, with one bill of costs, to be taxed in the Case of Wilson.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
