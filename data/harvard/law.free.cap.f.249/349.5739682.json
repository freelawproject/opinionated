The District Judge, who saw and heard the witnesses, has found as a fact that the collision was occasioned by the Flannery\u2019s failure to comply with the signal given by the Beard and which the Flannery had accepted. This court is reluctant to disturb a conclusion of fact reached by a trial judge, who had the advantage of seeing and hearing the witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-7\">Decree affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
