It is not necessary to decide whether the provisions of the Canal Zone law relied on in behalf of the plaintiff in error do or do not give a civil right of action for wrongfully causing the death of a human being. No provision of that law of which we are advised indicates that such a right of action is given to the personal representative of the deceased person.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-14\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
