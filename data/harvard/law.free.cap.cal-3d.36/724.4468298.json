J.</author>\n<p id=\"AXH\">This is an automatic appeal from a judgment imposing a penalty of death under the 1978 death penalty law. (Pen. Code, \u00a7 190.1 et seq.; see Pen. Code, \u00a7 1239, subd. (b).)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b760-6\">Two guilt phase issues require review. The first is whether the trial court correctly denied appellant\u2019s motion to suppress the statements he made to a jailhouse informant. The second is whether the trial court erred in failing to fully instruct, <em>sua sponte, </em>on the risks involved in juror note-taking. The court concludes that neither issue merits reversal of the guilt verdicts. However, the special circumstance finding contains <em>Carlos (Carlos </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1983) 35 Cal.3d 131 [197 Cal.Rptr. 79, 672 P.2d 862]) error, requiring a reversal of this finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-8\">A. <em>Procedural History</em></p>\n<p id=\"b760-9\">By information, appellant Charles Edward Whitt was charged with the murder of William McCafferty. A special circumstance was alleged in connection with this count in that the murder was committed while Whitt was engaged in the commission of a robbery in violation of section 211. (\u00a7 190.2, subd. (a)(17)(i).)</p>\n<p id=\"b760-10\">Whitt was also charged with robbery, assault with a deadly weapon (\u00a7 245, subd. (a)), and being an ex-felon in possession of a firearm (\u00a7 12021).</p>\n<p id=\"b760-11\">Before trial, Whitt entered a guilty plea to the ex-felon charge. A jury convicted him of the remaining offenses and found the special circumstance allegation to be true. Following a penalty phase trial, the jury fixed the sentence at death. Thereafter, Whitt\u2019s motions for a new trial (\u00a7 1181) and for modification of the verdict (\u00a7 190.4, subd. (e)) were denied. This automatic appeal followed. (\u00a7 1239, subd. (b).)</p>\n<p id=\"b761-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"729\">*729</page-number>B. <em>The Guilt Phase Evidence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b761-5\">On the evening of July 6, 1980, Whitt drove his pickup truck to Clella Goforth\u2019s house in Yucaipa. Ms. Goforth was acquainted with Whitt, but had not seen him in two years. Whitt told Ms. Goforth that he was looking for her business partner, Harold Williams. Whitt explained that he wanted to sell Williams some livestock because Whitt and his wife were separating, and he needed the money to move.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-6\">During this conversation, Ms. Goforth was standing inside a pool area enclosed by a masonry wall. Whitt was standing in the driveway outside the wall. They could see each other through the open grillwork along the top of the wall. Ms. Goforth did not notice any indication that Whitt had been drinking. She thought that he was under some stress due to the breakup of his marriage, but his conversation was coherent.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-7\">At the end of the conversation, Whitt said, \u201cI\u2019ll be back to see Harold.\u201d He did not appear to be angry, and he returned to his truck. Suddenly, he turned and fired a shotgun at Ms. Goforth. The shotgun blast hit the wall within an inch of where Ms. Goforth had been standing. Whitt then drove off at a high speed.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-8\">Twenty minutes later, he arrived at the Elkhorn General Store in Forest Falls. He bought beer and cigarettes and talked with one of the other two customers in the store. The store clerk, Linda Weisz, did not notice any signs of intoxication. However, one customer thought Whitt appeared irritable, nervous, and possibly under the influence of cocaine or PCP. Whitt left the store before the other two customers.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-9\">A few minutes after the departure of these customers, Whitt came back into the store. He pointed a gun at Ms. Weisz and demanded money from the cash register. She handed him approximately $250. As he left, he walked \u201ckind of sideways and backwards,\u201d watching Ms. Weisz while he backed out the front door. Almost immediately after Whitt was out the door, Ms. Weisz heard a gunshot. She locked the door and called the store owner. A minute later, she heard a screech of tires.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-10\">William McCafferty was found shortly thereafter lying on the ground in front of the store. He died en route to the hospital. The cause of his death was determined to be a shotgun wound to the neck. The sheriff\u2019s department was called, and Ms. Weisz gave a description of Whitt. Several neighbors gave a description of his truck, which had been parked in front of the store during the robbery. These descriptions were broadcast over police radio.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"730\">*730</page-number>Whitt\u2019s truck was stopped, and he was arrested. A shotgun was found on the floor of the passenger compartment of his truck.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Nearly $250 in cash was taken from him during the booking procedures. A blood test administered at the sheriff\u2019s station revealed a blood alcohol level of .10 percent. Testimony indicated that assuming an average burnoff rate, Whitt\u2019s blood alcohol level could have been as high as .14 percent at the time of the offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-4\">At the sheriff\u2019s station, Whitt was placed in a cell with Jimmy deLoach. They shared the cell for several weeks. During this period, Whitt allegedly described the crimes to deLoach. At the trial, deLoach recounted that Whitt told him about going to see Harold Williams at Clella Goforth\u2019s house. When Ms. Goforth told Whitt that Williams was not home, Whitt said, \u201cWell, when he gets back, tell him this.\u201d He then shot at Goforth and \u201cdidn\u2019t know how in the world he missed her.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b762-5\">DeLoach also testified that Whitt had related how he then went to the Elkhorn store to commit a robbery. As Whitt backed out of the store after taking the money, McCafferty called out, \u201cHey, what are you doing?\u201d Whitt said he \u201cturned around and blew him away.\u201d Whitt was afraid that McCafferty could identify him so, according to deLoach, he \u201chad to get out of the area real fast.\u201d After travelling about 30 miles in a direction away from Yucaipa, Whitt turned around and came back because he wanted to kill Goforth. The police stopped him en route to her house. At first, Whitt wanted \u201cto shoot it out with them,\u201d but he decided he \u201cdidn\u2019t have a chance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b762-6\">DeLoach also testified that Whitt said that he was planning to present a defense that he had been drinking beer all day. Alternatively, he was thinking of testifying that McCafferty had grabbed his gun while he was walking out of the store and that the gun had gone off by accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-7\">The prosecution also presented the testimony of a prison psychiatrist, Dr. Flanagan. Dr. Flanagan was present when a detective interviewed Whitt on the evening following his arrest. He testified that Whitt was alert, observant, gave appropriate answers, and was able to take a \u201cself-serving\u201d position. He thought that Whitt showed no signs of mental illness, and he opined that the manner in which Whitt handled the interview indicated an ability to premeditate and to \u201cchoose a course of action.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b763-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number>Whitt presented a diminished capacity defense. He was 31 years old at the time of his trial and had a troubled medical and psychiatric history. He was hospitalized three times during his childhood for a congenital heart problem. In 1971, he was committed to a state mental hospital and remained on antipsychotic medication after his release.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-5\">For the three years preceding his arrest, Whitt lived with Sherry S. and her child. For most of that period, they lived in a house which they rented from Whitt\u2019s parents. Sherry testified that Whitt\u2019s personality began to change early in 1979. He became short-tempered and moody. He talked to himself a great deal. He would accuse Sherry of talking about him behind his back with the neighbors. He drank peppermint schnapps, which caused him to \u201cgo into an outrage,\u201d forget who he was, and call Sherry names. Other people had also seen him behave violently when he was drunk on peppermint schnapps.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-6\">In January 1980, Sherry told him that she would leave if he did not quit drinking and smoking marijuana. He stopped\u2014at least until July\u2014but during that six-month period he showed serious signs of mental disturbance. He was not working, and he frequently fought with his parents about the rent on the house. He would talk to the television, particularly during violent shows, saying things like \u201cShoot that so-and-so. . . . You don\u2019t got the heart to shoot him. Don\u2019t got the heart to blow him away.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b763-7\">Whitt talked to himself as well. Sometimes he would go out in the yard and yell that people were talking behind his back, and they \u201cdidn\u2019t have the guts to face him like a man. \u201d Sherry also heard him talk this way in the middle of the night.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-8\">Whitt began drinking again on July 2nd, the Wednesday before his arrest. His parents visited that day and noticed him talking to the television set. He became very angry, shouted at them, and accused them of interfering with his life and creating problems between himself and Sherry. He ordered them out of the house. His mother handed Sherry an eviction notice, and the parents left.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-9\">By Saturday, July 5th, Sherry let Whitt know that she was planning to leave him. According to Sherry, Whitt was hurt, angry and acted very strangely. He stormed out of the house and did not come back that day. By noon on Sunday, the day of the robbery and shooting, he was drunk on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"732\">*732</page-number>peppermint schnapps. His speech was slurred and his walk impaired. He was still drunk when Sherry saw him on Sunday at 2 p.m.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b764-4\">Two other people saw Whitt on Sunday afternoon. Eugene Burke bought some livestock and some tools from him and thought that he was drunk. Lela Downs saw Whitt when he asked her to tell Sherry to send his clothing to him. Ms. Downs thought Whitt was upset and extremely drunk.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-5\">In March 1981, psychologist Stephen Lawrence interviewed Whitt in the San Bernardino County jail. A videotape of that interview was played to the jury. In it, Whitt described how he goes \u201ccuckoo bird\u201d and becomes violent after drinking peppermint schnapps. He said that for the year and a half before his arrest, he was not working and stayed home most of the time. He fought with his parents every time they visited because his mother did not appreciate how much work he was doing on the house.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-6\">At the interview, Whitt rejected the suggestion that he was hearing imaginary voices. He admitted hearing voices, but said that he knew where they were coming from. He felt he had a \u201chaunted ear\u201d\u2014\u201cpeople living in my ear. \u201d At home, he could hear the neighbors talking about him at night just as though they were in his house. Their \u201cincessant jabbering\u201d would keep him awake. Then he would go out in the yard and yell at them. Whitt thought his television did not say the same things to him as it did to the neighbors across the street.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-7\">Whitt told Dr. Lawrence that a few days before his arrest, he knew that Sherry was leaving. She and her mother were selling things around the house and pocketing the money. He knew there were hard times ahead, but he gave up caring about everything. He thought that the situation had gotten so bad because people feared him and were afraid to tell him the truth. He was angry about being lied to. That weekend he got very drunk for the first time in over a year.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-8\">C. <em>The Penalty Phase Evidence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b764-9\">The prosecution established that Whitt had been convicted of robbery in 1974.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-10\">For the defense, Dr. Lawrence testified that Whitt had a variety of mental disorders\u2014chronic paranoid schizophrenia dating back to adolescence, alcohol and drug dependence, and chronic and severe \u201cantisocial personality <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"733\">*733</page-number>disorder.\u201d He had the mental capacity to form the intent to kill and to rob, but it was unlikely that he actually did form the intent to kill. He was probably acutely psychotic and hearing voices at the time of the robbery. According to Dr. Lawrence, Whitt was startled when McCafferty called out to him and thought that McCafferty had touched his gun. If McCafferty had appeared a few seconds later, Dr. Lawrence believed no shooting would have taken place.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-5\">Dr. Lawrence felt confident that Whitt had not tried to feign mental illness during his videotaped interview.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> On the contrary, Whitt did not think of himself as mentally ill and during the interview denied that he had serious problems. As for Whitt\u2019s statements to deLoach, Dr. Lawrence explained that they were probably the boasting of someone who felt very inadequate.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-6\">Dr. Lawrence stated that the stress and the deteriorating situation preceding the crimes had seriously impaired Whitt\u2019s thinking. Whitt was aware that he was incapable of caring for himself, much less of supporting a family. His girlfriend and her child were in the process of leaving him, and his mother had served him with an eviction notice. He had no money and no place to go. Under these pressures, he became psychotic and delusional.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-7\">On cross-examination, the prosecutor focused on Whitt\u2019s \u201canti-social personality\u201d rather than on his schizophrenia. Although Whitt comes from a middle-class family and has a brother who is a successful businessman, he has never been steadily employed. He began to abuse drugs in his teens and had many arrests for drug offenses. For several years, he was a \u201changer-on\u201d with a motorcycle gang.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-8\">Dr. Lawrence admitted that many of Whitt\u2019s ideas and actions were typical of an antisocial personality. For example, Whitt tended to justify his drug abuse and criminal activity. He thought that his own behavior was acceptable and that the police were harassing him. As another example, Whitt had become angry with his parents for not posting bail when he was on trial for the 1974 robbery, even though he had told them he would flee if he were released. According to Dr. Lawrence, Whitt\u2019s boasting to deLoach in the county jail was consistent with an antisocial personality.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-9\">Notwithstanding all these indications of an antisocial personality, Dr. Lawrence maintained that this disorder was no longer predominant during the few years preceding the offense. Whitt was no longer leading the intense, \u201chigh-pitched\u201d and reckless life indicative of an antisocial person<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"734\">*734</page-number>ality, as he had done in his twenties. Instead he had withdrawn into an isolated existence with Sherry and was influenced primarily by his psychotic disorder. Dr. Lawrence felt certain that during the days leading up to the offense, this psychosis was affecting his behavior.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-4\">In rebuttal, the prosecution presented Dr. Flanagan, who testified that Whitt\u2019s prison records from the mid-1970\u2019s showed no manifestations of schizophrenia. Dr. Flanagan believed that schizophrenia would be aggravated by a stressful environment such as prison and that symptoms of this condition would have been observed by prison personnel.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-5\">The jury returned a sentence of death.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-7\">The trial court\u2019s failure to instruct the jury under <em>Carlos </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>35 Cal.3d 131 will be addressed first because this error requires the special circumstance finding to be set aside and the penalty judgment to be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-8\">At the close of the guilt phase, the jury was instructed to find the robbery-murder special circumstance allegation true if it found \u201cthat the murder was committed during the immediate flight after the commission of a robbery by the defendant; and . . . that the murder was committed in order to carry out or advance the commission of the crime of robbery or to facilitate the escape therefrom or to avoid detection.\u201d (See CALJIC No. 8.81.17 (4th ed., 1980 rev.).) The jury was not instructed to find that Whitt intended to kill or to aid a killing.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-9\">In <em>Carlos, </em>this court held that proof of intent to kill or to aid a killing is essential to sustain a felony-murder special circumstance allegation under the 1978 death penalty law. In <em>People </em>v. <em>Garcia </em>(1984) <em>ante, </em>pp. 539, 547-549 [205 Cal.Rptr. 265, 684 P.2d 826] this court has held that <em>Carlos </em>applies retroactively to all cases not yet final. <em>Garcia </em>also holds that where the instructions \u201ccompletely eliminated the issue of intent to kill from the consideration of the jury,\u201d a reversal of the special circumstance finding is required. <em>(Id., </em>at p. 554.)</p>\n<p id=\"b766-10\"><em>Garcia </em>recognizes four exceptions to this holding. Two are based on <em>Connecticut </em>v. <em>Johnson </em>(1983) 460 U.S. 73, 87 [74 L.Ed.2d 823, 834, 103 S.Ct. 969, 977-978] and would allow affirmance \u201cif the erroneous instruction was given in connection with an offense for which the defendant was acquitted and if the instruction had no bearing on the offense for which he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"735\">*735</page-number>was convicted\u201d or \u201cif the defendant conceded the issue of intent.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Garcia, supra, ante, </em>at p. 554.)</p>\n<p id=\"b767-5\">The third exception is based on <em>People </em>v. <em>Sedeno </em>(1974) 10 Cal.3d 703, 721 [112 Cal.Rptr. 1, 518 P.2d 913], and provides that the failure to give a <em>Carlos </em>instruction is harmless error where \u201c \u2018the factual question posed by the omitted instruction was necessarily resolved adversely to the defendant under other, properly given instructions.\u2019 \u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Garcia, supra, ante, </em>at p. 555, quoting from <em>People </em>v. <em>Sedeno, supra, </em>10 Cal.3d at p. 721.)</p>\n<p id=\"b767-6\">The fourth exception is fashioned after <em>People </em>v. <em>Cantrell </em>(1973) 8 Cal.3d 672, 685 [105 Cal.Rptr. 792, 504 P.2d 1256] and <em>People </em>v. <em>Thornton </em>(1974) 11 Cal.3d 738, 768-769, footnote 20 [114 Cal.Rptr. 467, 523 P.2d 267], Thus, \u201cthere may ... be cases where the parties recognized that intent to kill was in issue, presented all evidence at their command on that issue, and in which the record not only establishes the necessary intent as a matter of law but shows the contrary evidence not worthy of consideration. \u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Garcia, supra, ante, </em>at p. 556, fn. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b767-7\">None of these exceptions is applicable here. The <em>Connecticut </em>v. <em>Johnson </em>exceptions are inapplicable because appellant was not \u201cacquitted\u201d of the special circumstance allegation. Neither did he concede the issue of intent at this stage. The record indicates that he simply did not realize intent was in issue at that point.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b767-8\">Nor does the <em>Cantrell-Thornton </em>exception apply. The parties <em>did </em>recognize that Whitt\u2019s intent to kill was in issue at the penalty phase. However, defense evidence on that issue\u2014the testimony of Dr. Lawrence\u2014cannot be dismissed as \u201cnot worthy of consideration.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Garcia, supra, ante, </em>at p. 556.)</p>\n<p id=\"b767-9\">Even the guilt phase evidence on this issue cannot be so dismissed. The shooting occurred within minutes after Whitt had told the store clerk that he didn\u2019t want to hurt anyone. It occurred within seconds after Whitt backed out the front door of the store. Apparently, McCafferty was standing on or near the store\u2019s front porch within a few feet of Whitt. Defense evidence suggested that the shooting was a reflexive action which occurred when McCafferty startled Whitt as he was leaving the store.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"736\">*736</page-number>In addition, the evidence suggested that Whitt was intoxicated at the time of the shooting. Also, Whitt heard and responded to imaginary voices, and the shooting may have been a reaction to these voices. Thus, the existing record fails to establish an intent to kill as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-4\">Finally, the <em>Sede\u00f1o </em>exception <em>(People </em>v. <em>Sedeno, supra, </em>10 Cal.3d 703) does not apply. No instruction squarely posed the question of an intent to kill. The murder count was submitted to the jury on a felony-murder theory. Thus, the jury was not required to find an intentional killing in order to return the first degree murder verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-5\">It is true that the special circumstance instruction required the jury to find that Whitt shot McCafferty in order to carry out the robbery or to facilitate the escape. However, even this instruction did not necessarily require the jury to resolve that Whitt intended to kill. There was evidence that he intended to rob but lacked the intent to kill. Thus, the finding that Whitt killed in order to rob or to escape from the robbery may indicate only that the jury believed the shooting was a reaction to Whitt\u2019s sudden discovery that McCafferty was obstructing his path as he left the store.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-6\">Since there is no basis for concluding that the omission of the intent-to-kill element from the special circumstance instruction was harmless, that finding must be set aside. Accordingly, the judgment of death must also be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-7\">m.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-8\">The first guilt phase issue involves Whitt\u2019s statements to Jimmy deLoach, his cellmate in the San Bernardino County jail, and whether these should have been suppressed under the Fifth or Sixth Amendments.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-9\">Prior to trial, Whitt moved unsuccessfully to suppress deLoach\u2019s testimony on the ground that deLoach was acting as a police agent when he talked with Whitt in the jail. Whitt argued that, as an agent, deLoach was required to give Miranda<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> warnings before taking any statement. On appeal, Whitt renews this claim. He also contends\u2014despite the absence of objection below\u2014that his statement was taken in violation of his Sixth Amendment right to counsel. Alternatively, Whitt contends that he was denied the effec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"737\">*737</page-number>live assistance of counsel by counsel\u2019s failure to preserve the Sixth Amendment claim.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b769-5\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-6\">Whitt presented the factual basis for his claim at a lengthy pretrial hearing. DeLoach was arrested in Georgia in June 1980, having escaped from a California prison where he was serving a term for writing bad checks. Detective Stowe, who worked in the homicide division of the San Bernardino County Sheriff\u2019s office, went to Georgia to escort him back to San Bernardino County on an extradition warrant. During the flight back to California, the two had a friendly conversation but did not discuss deLoach\u2019s case. DeLoach appreciated the fact that Stowe allowed him to remove his leg restraints while they were on the plane. At the end of the flight, Stowe gave deLoach his card and asked deLoach to contact him if he heard anything about any homicides. Stowe testified that it was his standard practice to make this request of persons whom he arrested or transported.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-7\">DeLoach had previously worked as an informer for the federal Drug Enforcement Administration in Cleveland, Washington, and Philadelphia. He had also informed for the San Diego Police Department vice squad. He worked for money, rather than to \u201cwork off a beef.\u201d However, during the flight, deLoach did not discuss his career as an informer. When Stowe gave deLoach his card he was not aware that deLoach was a police informant.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-8\">DeLoach arrived at the jail on June 18th. Whitt was placed in his cell on July 7th. The jail sheriff testified that cell assignments were made by a floor deputy based on the availability of space. Neither the watch commander nor the floor deputy was aware of deLoach\u2019s prior career as an informer. The jail sheriff also testified that few newspapers were delivered to the jail before July 19th, so deLoach was probably not made aware of the importance of Whitt\u2019s case until several days after Whitt arrived.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-9\">Whitt and deLoach met on the morning of July 7th and recognized each other from San Quentin. Within hours, Whitt allegedly told deLoach his story. DeLoach promptly requested a meeting with Stowe. On July 8th he met with Stowe and with Detective Swanlund, an investigator on the Whitt case. DeLoach gave the two detectives a brief version of the offense as he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"738\">*738</page-number>had learned it from Whitt. DeLoach also told them that Whitt was planning to present a defense that he was drunk at the time of the robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-4\">At the conclusion of that conversation, Stowe said he would contact the district attorney\u2019s office about deLoach\u2019s case. Stowe also warned deLoach not to solicit any further information. Stowe was aware that if deLoach acted as a police agent, the information he gathered might not be admissible as evidence. However, deLoach was told that if he happened to hear any more iiiformation from Whitt, \u201cthere was nothing that we could do, you know.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b770-5\">Later in the afternoon of July 8th, deLoach talked to his attorney. De-Loach asked whether he could get a suspended or a concurrent sentence on the 'escape charge in exchange for cooperation on the Whitt case. The attorney warned him of the dangers of becoming a jail \u201csnitch,\u201d and advised hitn th\u00e1t.it probably was not worth his while to cooperate. The attorney advised him that at the very least, deLoach should obtain a promise of leniency in writing before giving the police any more information.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-6\">According to his attorney, deLoach understood that his instructions from the sheriff\u2019s detectives were to \u201ckeep Whitt talking.\u201d However, deLoach himself testified that Stowe had told him not to \u201cmess with [Whitt].\u201d The trial court found that the officers had told deLoach not to ask Whitt any further questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-7\">DeLoach did not see Stowe again after July 8th. On July 25th, Detective Swanlund came to see deLoach. This meeting was not at deLoach\u2019s request. Swanlund came because he wanted to make sure that deLoach was in protective custody before he released deLoach\u2019s July 8th statement to Whitt\u2019s attorney. At the meeting, deLoach volunteered that he had had further conversations with Whitt. DeLoach then gave Swanlund a much more detailed description of the crime as Whitt had allegedly told it to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-8\">At some point between July 8th and July 25th, the two detectives did contact the district attorney on deLoach\u2019s behalf. However, deLoach never received any promises of leniency, and testified that by July 25th he no longer expected any favors. Nor did he receive a more lenient sentence or other favorable treatment (other than protective custody) in exchange for his information.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b771-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"739\">*739</page-number>At the suppression hearing, deLoach testified that Whitt had volunteered all his statements about the offense and his possible defenses. DeLoach said that he had not asked any questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-5\">The trial court denied the motion to suppress Whitt\u2019s statements to deLoach. It found that these statements were made voluntarily, that the police had not asked deLoach to ask Whitt any questions, that deLoach did not receive or expect to receive any benefits, and that deLoach was not a police agent.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-6\">Whitt contends that these findings were erroneous, and that all statements made after July 8th\u2014the date of deLoach\u2019s first meeting with the detectives\u2014should have been suppressed. He argues that after that date, deLoach was acting as a police agent. Therefore, he argues, the state \u201cdeliberately elicited\u201d his statements through deLoach, in violation of the Sixth Amendment right to counsel.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>(Massiah </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1964) 377 U.S. 201 [12 L.Ed.2d 246, 84 S.Ct. 1199]; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Henry </em>(1980) 447 U.S. 264 [65 L.Ed.2d 115, 100 S.Ct. 2183].) He further argues that the statements were obtained in violation of the Fifth Amendment, since he was not <em>Mirandized (Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona, supra, </em>384 U.S. 436) and that his statements were not voluntary.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-7\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-8\">Preliminarily, Whitt argues that his Sixth Amendment claim may be raised on appeal even though he did not clearly articulate this objection in the trial court. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Quirk </em>(1982) 129 Cal.App.3d 618, 634 [181 Cal.Rptr. 301]; <em>Cahill </em>v. <em>Rushen </em>(E.D.Cal. 1980) 501 F.Supp. 1219, 1228, fn. 11, affd. (9th Cir. 1982) 678 F.2d 791.) Further, he contends that admission of an illegally obtained confession may be reviewed even in the absence of a contemporaneous objection, whether the illegality consists of a violation of Fifth or Sixth Amendment rights.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark>\n                   Lastly, he asserts that his attorney\u2019s failure to articulate a Sixth Amendment objection denied him the effective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"740\">*740</page-number>Notwithstanding defense counsel\u2019s failure expressly to state a Sixth Amendment claim, the parties developed an extensive record concerning the sheriff\u2019s department\u2019s relations with deLoach.  Although the question is a close one, this record supports the conclusion that the state did not deliberately elicit Whitt\u2019s statements to deLoach.  Therefore, defense counsel\u2019s failure to articulate a Sixth Amendment basis for his objection did not result in any prejudice to Whitt. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Fosselman </em>(1983) 33 Cal.3d 572, 584 [189 Cal.Rptr. 855, 659 P.2d 1144].)</p>\n<p id=\"b772-4\">In <em>United States </em>v. <em>Henry, supra, </em>447 U.S. 264, the United States Supreme Court explained what conduct on the part of the government and/or an informant would amount to deliberate elicitation. In <em>Henry, </em>the government agents contacted Nichols, a paid informant, who was housed in a cell with several federal prisoners, including the accused (Henry). Nichols was specifically told not to initiate any conversation with or question Henry about the charges against him. However, if Henry engaged Nichols in conversation or talked in front of him, Nichols was to \u201cpay attention to\u201d Henry\u2019s statements. <em>(United States </em>v. <em>Henry, supra, </em>447 U.S. at p. 268 [65 L.Ed.2d at pp. 120-121].)</p>\n<p id=\"b772-5\">The court\u2019s holding that Henry\u2019s statements to Nichols were deliberately elicited was based on three factors. \u201cFirst, Nichols was acting under instructions as a paid informant for the Government; second, Nichols was ostensibly no more than a fellow inmate of Henry; and third, Henry was in custody and under indictment at the time he was engaged in conversation by Nichols.\u201d <em>(United States </em>v. <em>Henry, supra, </em>447 U.S. at p. 270 [65 L.Ed.2d at p. 122].)</p>\n<p id=\"b772-6\">The court did not focus on whether Nichols had actively interrogated Henry. Instead, the court noted only that \u201cNichols was not a passive listener; rather he had \u2018some conversations with Mr. Henry\u2019 while he was in jail and Henry\u2019s incriminatory statements were \u2018the product of this conversation.\u2019\u201d <em>(United States </em>v. <em>Henry, supra, </em>447 U.S. at p. 271 [65 L.Ed.2d at pp. 122-123].)</p>\n<p id=\"b772-7\">While the court reserved the question whether there could be deliberate elicitation \u201cwhere an informant is placed in close proximity but makes no effort to stimulate conversations about the crime charged\u201d <em>(id., </em>at p. 271, fn. 9 [65 L.Ed.2d at p. 123]), it recalled that \u201c[i]n <em>Massiah, [Massiah </em>v. <em>United States, supra, </em>377 U.S. 201] no inquiry was made as to whether Massiah or his codefendant first raised the subject of the crime under investigation.\u201d <em>(United States </em>v. <em>Henry, supra, </em>447 U.S. at pp. 271-272 [65 L.Ed.2d at p. 123].) Nor did the court make such inquiry concerning the conversations between Henry and Nichols.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"741\">*741</page-number>These passages indicate that in deciding whether information has been \u201cdeliberately elicited,\u201d the courts must focus on the state\u2019s conduct as a whole, rather than on the informant\u2019s. \u201cBy intentionally creating a situation likely to induce Henry to make incriminating statements without the assistance of counsel, the Government violated Henry\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to counsel.\u201d <em>(United States </em>v. <em>Henry, supra, </em>447 U.S. at p. 274 [65 L.Ed.2d at p. 125].) Thus, <em>Henry </em>teaches that where the state has directed an informant to obtain incriminating information, or where it has created powerful inducements for him to do so\u2014particularly in a custodial setting\u2014it is not significant whether the informant or the accused initiated the conversation.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-5\">Cases decided in the wake of <em>Henry </em>confirm this conclusion. For example, in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Sampol </em>(D.C.Cir. 1980) 636 F.2d 621, an informant was placed on probation on condition that he spend six months in jail and provide the government with information about criminal activity. The informant faced a substantial prison sentence if he did not provide satisfactory information. <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 632-635.) However, the government did not direct him toward any particular inmate. When the informant began bringing back reports from inmate Ross, the only instructions he received were not to initiate any conversations with Ross. <em>(Id., </em>at p. 635.)</p>\n<p id=\"b773-6\">The <em>Sampol </em>court found that the informant obtained Ross\u2019 statements in violation of <em>Henry. (United States </em>v. <em>Sampol, supra, </em>636 F.2d at pp. 637-638.) The court found it immaterial that the informant had not initiated any conversation with Ross. The informant was able to obtain the desired information without asking questions. He obtained it through his \u201cability to \u2018ingratiate\u2019 himself with criminals\u201d and to encourage their confidences. <em>(Id., </em>at p. 638.) This ability \u201cwas part of his stock in trade.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>It was in fact the very quality which enabled him to bargain with the government for probation in exchange for jailhouse information. The government was well aware of this ability when it struck its bargain with the informant.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b773-7\">In light of the government\u2019s knowledge of the informant\u2019s ability to elicit confidences, the <em>Sampol </em>court found it irrelevant that the government had not directed him towards Ross or towards any other particular inmate. By giving the informant a powerful inducement to bring back incriminating <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"742\">*742</page-number>statements from any inmate, the \u201cgovernment trolled in the jail, using [the informant] as bait, and was ready to net any unwary inmate who rose to the lure.\u201d <em>(United States </em>v. <em>Sampol, supra, </em>636 F.2d at p. 638.) Thus, any statements the informant obtained after the date his bargain was struck with the government were \u201cdeliberately elicited\u201d and were inadmissible under <em>Henry.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b774-4\">In sum, the critical inquiry is whether the state has created a situation likely to provide it with incriminating statements from an accused. If it has, it may not disclaim responsibility for this information by the simple device of telling an informant to \u201clisten but don\u2019t ask.\u201d Thus, the trial court\u2019s findings that deLoach was told not to question Whitt and that he did not do so are irrelevant to the question whether Whitt\u2019s statements were deliberately elicited.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-5\">It is also irrelevant to the <em>Henry </em>analysis that an accused\u2019s statements were voluntarily made. \u201cSince \u2018coercion\u2019 is not a Sixth Amendment question, \u2018voluntariness\u2019 simply plays no part in the test of admissibility.\u201d <em>(Cahill </em>v. <em>Rushen, supra, </em>501 F.Supp. at p. 1225.)</p>\n<p id=\"b774-6\">A factor which <em>is </em>significant in the analysis is the accused\u2019s custodial status. As <em>Henry </em>notes, \u201cthe mere fact of custody imposes pressures on the accused; confinement may bring into play subtle influences that will make him particularly susceptible to the ploys of undercover Government agents. . . . [T]he incriminating conversations between Henry and Nichols were facilitated by Nichols\u2019 conduct and apparent status as a person sharing a common plight.\u201d <em>(United States </em>v. <em>Henry, supra, </em>447 U.S. at p. 274 [65 L.Ed.2d at p. 124]; see also <em>Cahill </em>v. <em>Rushen, supra, </em>501 F.Supp. at p. 1228.)<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b774-9\">However, if an informant interrogates an accused, but acts on his own initiative rather than at the behest of the government, the government may not be said to have deliberately elicited the statements. <em>(Thomas </em>v. <em>Cox </em>(4th Cir. 1983) 708 F.2d 132, cert. den., 464 U.S. 918 [78 L.Ed.2d 262, 104 S.CL 284]; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Malik </em>(7th Cir. 1982) 680 F.2d 1162.) In <em>Thomas, </em>an informant told the state police investigator about some incriminating statements by a fellow inmate. The investigator advised the informant that no promises could be made but that information would be accepted if given. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"743\">*743</page-number>The informant returned with additional incriminating statements from the inmate. <em>(Thomas </em>v. <em>Cox, supra, </em>708 F.2d at p. 133.) At an evidentiary hearing, the informant testified that his motive for collecting the information was \u201ccuriosity,\u201d and that he had not decided to cooperate with the state until after his release from prison. <em>(Id., </em>at p. 134.)</p>\n<p id=\"b775-5\">The United States Court of Appeals held that this information had not been \u201cdeliberately elicited\u201d under <em>Henry. </em>In <em>Henry, </em>the informant was \u201cspecifically contacted by the government and given his charge respecting the procurement of possibly incriminating information . . . .\u201d <em>(Thomas </em>v. <em>Cox, supra, </em>708 F.2d at p. 135.) Also, the informant in <em>Henry </em>was working on a contingent fee arrangement, for he was to be paid for information actually delivered. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b775-6\">The <em>Thomas </em>court recognized that such a \u201cfee\u201d may be in the form of lenient sentencing rather than cash. <em>(Thomas </em>v. <em>Cox, supra, </em>708 F.2d at pp. 135-136; see also <em>United States </em>v. <em>Sampol, supra, </em>636 F.2d at pp. 632-638.) However, if the informant has been given no reason to anticipate lenient treatment and does not actually receive any reduction in sentencing, there is no \u201cquid pro quo\u201d arrangement to support a finding that the informant acted as a government agent. <em>(Thomas </em>v. <em>Cox, supra, </em>708 F.2d at pp. 135-137, and fn. 4.)</p>\n<p id=\"b775-7\">Similarly, in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Malik </em>(7th Cir. 1982) 680 F.2d 1162, the informant (Richards) obtained damaging statements from two fellow inmates who were awaiting trial. Richards had previously been an informant for the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) in other cases. However, at the time of his conversations with the Maliks, Richards was angry with the FBI agents, who had arrested him on an extradition warrant when he understood that they would not do so. <em>(Id., </em>at p. 1164.) There was testimony that Richards was planning to make a deal with the Maliks at the time of his conversations with them, and only later decided to report those conversations to the government instead. <em>(Id., </em>at p. 1165.)</p>\n<p id=\"b775-8\">As in <em>Thomas, </em>the court found that the government had not deliberately elicited the conversations with the Maliks. It \u201crefuse[d] to extend the rule of <em>Massiah </em>and <em>Henry </em>to situations where an individual, acting on his own initiative, deliberately elicits incriminating information.\u201d <em>(United States </em>v. <em>Malik, supra, </em>680 F.2d at p. 1165.) It observed that \u201c[t]he Maliks suggest that the Government must go to extraordinary lengths to protect defendants from their own loose talk; they suggest that potential informants be segregated from other inmates. We do not believe that the Sixth Amendment right to counsel requires the Government to take such steps.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b776-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"744\">*744</page-number>In light of the foregoing cases, this court concludes that Whitt\u2019s statements to deLoach were not deliberately elicited. The question is a very close and difficult one. The detectives\u2019 offer to speak to the prosecutor on deLoach\u2019s behalf on July 8th raises a serious concern as to whether the state gave deLoach an incentive to extract further statements from Whitt. Furthermore, the fact that the police must have realized on July 8th that deLoach was interested in informing and hoped for a reward for his information gives pause. If the police had had any working arrangements of this sort with deLoach in the past, their acceptance of his information and their agreement to speak to the prosecutor might well have been enough to attribute deLoach\u2019s post-July 8th activities to them.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Under those circumstances, the inference that deLoach expected a quid pro quo and that the police encouraged this expectation would be compelling.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-4\">However, absent such a prior relationship with deLoach, the mere acceptance of his information, even with the promise to talk to the prosecutor, is not sufficient encouragement to hold the police accountable for deLoach\u2019s subsequent actions. Furthermore, the promise to speak to the prosecutor was in no way conditioned on deLoach providing any further information. The police did not indicate that more information would help influence the prosecutor towards leniency. Finally, the police made no arrangements to contact deLoach again after July 8th regarding his conversations with Whitt. Detective Swanlund met with deLoach on July 25th only to notify him that Swanlund was going to release the July 8th report to the defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-5\">Most significant are the facts that the detectives did not succeed in obtaining any promise of leniency for deLoach, who must have been aware by July 25th that no promises were likely. Certainly, the police did nothing after July 8th to indicate to deLoach that his reports would in fact convince the prosecutor to be lenient.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-6\">Thus, on these close facts it cannot be found that the police gave deLoach the incentive to obtain information from Whitt after July 8th, to such an extent that deLoach\u2019s conduct is attributable to the state. As no Sixth Amendment claim can be established, defense counsel cannot be found ineffective for failing to raise it.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-7\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-8\">Whitt also contends that since deLoach was a police agent, deLoach was required to give <em>Miranda </em>warnings <em>(Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona, supra, </em>384 U.S. 436) before any interrogation.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"745\">*745</page-number><em>Miranda </em>and its progeny govern law enforcement officials, their agents, and agents of the court. <em>(In re Deborah C. </em>(1981) 30 Cal.3d 125, 130 [177 Cal.Rptr. 852, 635 P.2d 446].) \u201c \u2018A private citizen is not required to advise another individual of his rights before questioning him. Absent evidence of complicity on the part of law enforcement officials, the admissions or statements of a defendant to a private citizen infringe no constitutional guarantees.\u2019 [Citations.]\u201d <em>(In re Eric J. </em>(1979) 25 Cal.3d 522, 527 [159 Cal.Rptr. 317, 601 P.2d 549].)</p>\n<p id=\"b777-5\">The trial court found that deLoach was not a police agent when he talked to Whitt. This finding was tantamount to a conclusion that there was no \u201claw enforcement complicity\u201d in deLoach\u2019s activities. For the reasons set forth in Part IIIB, <em>ante, </em>this court agrees that there was no agency relationship. Therefore, the trial court\u2019s conclusion was correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-6\"> Whitt nonetheless urges this court to reject the trial court\u2019s contrary finding as \u201cpalpably erroneous.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark>\n                   An agency relationship between deLoach and the authorities was established, Whitt argues, because (1) deLoach obviously wanted leniency and had been advised by his attorney to obtain a written guarantee of leniency before providing any further information; and (2) the police wanted the information and, therefore, must have given deLoach some promise of leniency.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-7\">However, these motivations suggest at most a hope for some reward by deLoach. They do not demonstrate that the police actively encouraged this hope or that the police actually promised to do anything in exchange for information. Thus, the record does not demonstrate that an agency relationship was established.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-8\">In addition to his <em>Miranda </em>argument, Whitt contends that his statements should have been suppressed because they were involuntary. This claim, too, lacks merit. It is based solely on the premise that deLoach was acting as a government agent\u2014a premise which is not tenable on the present record.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-9\">This court does not foreclose the possibility that when an accused is in custody and confides in a government agent who is \u201costensibly no more than a fellow inmate\u201d <em>(United States </em>v. <em>Henry, supra, </em>447 U.S. at p. 270 [65 L.Ed.2d at p. 122]), his statements may be deemed involuntary even though there is no coercion. The accused may well make \u201cvoluntary\u201d state<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"746\">*746</page-number>ments when he believes he is conversing with an ally. Yet by purposefully creating a false sense of security, the state is in a sense causing or compelling the accused to speak when he would not otherwise do so. Here, however, the informant was <em>not </em>a government agent. There is no hint in the record of any other fact which rendered Whitt\u2019s statements involuntary.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Thus, they were properly admitted into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-4\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-5\"> Whitt next contends that the guilt verdicts must be reversed due to the trial court\u2019s failure to give, <em>sua sponte, </em>a cautionary instruction on jury notetaking.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b778-6\">Although section 1137 implicitly approves the practice of juror note-taking,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Whitt argues that the dangers inherent in this practice demand a cautionary instruction whenever the practice is allowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-7\">Several decisions from other jurisdictions have discussed this issue. In <em>People </em>v. <em>DiLuca </em>(1982) 85 App.Div.2d 439 [448 N.Y.S.2d 730], a New York court summarized the arguments against note-taking. There is a possibility that \u201cmore significance will be placed by the jurors on their notes, which may be inaccurate, incomplete or misleading, than on their own independent recollection. The notes may accentuate irrelevancies and ignore more substantial issues and evidence. . . . [T]he juror with the best notes will unduly influence and possibly mislead the other jurors.\u201d <em>(Id.., </em>at p. 734.) Furthermore, note-taking may \u201cdistract the jurors\u2019 attention from the proceedings. Instead of listening to important testimony, the jurors may be jotting down notes on a different and less important point. While taking notes, the jurors may also not pay sufficient attention to the behavior of witnesses and may thus be unable to properly assess their credibility.\u201d <em>(Ibid..) </em>A federal court has voiced similar concerns. <em>(United States </em>v. <em>Maclean </em>(3d Cir. 1978) 578 F.2d 64, 66.)</p>\n<p id=\"b779-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"747\">*747</page-number>Because of these risks, a number of courts have held that a cautionary instruction is required. For example, the <em>DiLuca </em>court held that the instruction should include \u201can explanation . . . that [jurors] should not permit their note-taking to distract them from the ongoing proceedings; that their notes are only an aid to their memory and should not take precedence over their independent recollection; that those jurors who do not take notes should rely on their independent recollection of the evidence and not be influenced by the fact that another juror has taken notes; and that the notes are for the note taker\u2019s own personal use in refreshing his recollection of the evidence. The jury must be reminded that should any discrepancy exist between their recollection of the evidence and their notes, they should request that the record of the proceedings be read back and that it is the transcript that must prevail over their notes.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>DiLuca, supra, </em>448 N.Y.S.2d at p. 735.)<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b779-5\">The <em>DiLuca </em>court upheld the trial court\u2019s decision to permit note-taking, but found error in its failure to give this cautionary instruction. The error was found to require reversal because there was not \u201coverwhelming evidence\u201d in support of the verdict. (Id., at p. 735.)</p>\n<p id=\"b779-6\">California, in contrast to New York and other jurisdictions, has given implicit statutory approval to note-taking. (\u00a7 1137; see generally Annot. (1967) 14 A.L.R.3d 831.) However, it cannot be said that by enacting this statute the Legislature has determined that note-taking is free from the risks described in <em>DiLuca, </em>or that a cautionary instruction is not appropriate. For the reasons stated in <em>DiLuca </em>and <em>Maclean, </em>the better practice is to give such an instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-7\">However, whether the trial court was required to so instruct in this case need not be decided since the trial court gave an instruction which included the cautionary warnings Whitt urges. The trial judge asked the jurors to \u201c[b]e careful as to the amount of notes that you take. I\u2019d rather that you observe the witness, observe the demeanor of that witness, listen to how that person testifies rather than taking copious notes. . . . [I]f you do not recall exactly as to what a witness might have said or you disagree, for instance, during the deliberation [szc] as to what a witness may have said, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"748\">*748</page-number>we can reread that transcript back by that witness back to you. Remember that aspect of it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b780-4\">While this instruction was not as complete as the one outlined in <em>DiLuca, </em>it did inform the jury of the dangers which <em>Maclean </em>and <em>DiLuca </em>noted. Thus, the instruction substantially complied with the principles endorsed by these cases, even though a more complete instruction would have been preferable.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-5\">In any event, the evidence of guilt was relatively simple. The percipient witnesses to the assault and robbery gave straightforward accounts of the incidents. Even though Whitt presented evidence of diminished capacity, he never argued from this evidence that he was unable to form the specific intent to commit robbery,<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> and such evidence would not have negated his mens rea for the assault, a general intent crime. No other defense evidence suggested that he lacked the mens rea for either offense..

During its case in chief, the prosecution presented the testimony of Dr. Flanagan, a prison psychiatrist, to the effect that at the time of Whitt\u2019s postarrest interview during which he asserted his <em>Miranda </em>rights, Whitt was alert, \u201cobservant to his immediate surroundings,\u201d and \u201cable to .take a self-serving position.\u201d This testimony was offered to refute an anticipated diminished capacity defense. Defense counsel made no objection to it in the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-10\">Assuming this testimony should have been excluded upon a timely objection, it nonetheless appears to negate only the element of the intent to kill. None of Whitt\u2019s evidence negat\u00e9d an intent to rob, and defense counsel did not argue otherwise to the jury. An intent to rob was sufficient to sustain the first degree murder verdict. Thus, Dr. Flanagan\u2019s testimony could be prejudicial only with respect to the special circumstance finding. As this finding must be set aside for <em>Carlos </em>error (see <em>ante, </em>part H), it is not necessary to decide whether this court should resolve the admissibility of Dr. Flanagan\u2019s testimony in the absence of an objection below.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-11\">It does appear, however, that Dr. Flanagan\u2019s testimony was based solely on Whitt\u2019s words and conduct in invoking his <em>Miranda </em>rights. The testimony was, therefore, constitution\u00e1lly objectionable. First, the prosecution was in effect permitted to use Whitt\u2019s exercise of his Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights to furnish evidence of the mental elements of the charged offenses. Yet <em>Miranda </em>itself teaches that \u201cit is impermissible to penalize an individual for exercising his Fifth Amendment privilege when he is under police custodial interrogation. The prosecution may not, therefore, use at trial the fact that he stood mute or claimed his privilege in the face of accusation.\u201d <em>(Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona, supra, </em>384 U.S. at p. 468, fn. 37 [16 L.Ed.2d at p. 720].) To make such use of an assertion of rights is impermissible because it would exact \u201ca penalty ... for exercising a constitutional privilege. It [would] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"749\">*749</page-number>cut[] down on the privilege by making its assertion costly.\u201d <em>(Griffin </em>v. <em>California </em>(1965) 380 U.S. 609, 614 [14 L.Ed.2d 106, 109-110, 85 S.Ct. 1229]; see also <em>Doyle </em>v. <em>Ohio </em>(1976) 426 U.S. 610, 618 [49 L.Ed.2d 91, 98, 96 S.Ct. 2240].) These principles apply whether the prosecution uses constitutionally protected silence to prove the actus reus or the mens rea of the charged offense. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Fabert </em>(1982) 127 Cal.App.3d 604, 610-611 [179 Cal.Rptr. 702]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Schindler </em>(1980) 114 Cal.App.3d 178, 186-187 [170 Cal.Rptr. 461].)</p>\n<p id=\"b781-9\">Even though evidence of Whitt's silence was not presented directly to the jury, but instead was used as the basis for an expert opinion on Whitt\u2019s guilt, the constitutional error is essentially the same as that identified in <em>Miranda </em>and <em>Griffin. </em>The prosecution may not make indirect use of constitutionally protected silence by presenting it to the jury in the form of an expert opinion. <em>(Gholson </em>v. <em>Estelle </em>(5th Cir. 1982) 675 F.2d 734, 742.)</p>\n<p id=\"b781-10\">A second reason why Dr. Flanagan\u2019s opinion was objectionable is that in effect it made use of a compelled communication to provide evidence of Whitt\u2019s guilty mens rea. Whitt was compelled to speak in order to assert his constitutionally protected right to silence. Furthermore, this speech\u2014the statement that he wished to see an attorney rather than to discuss his case with the pplice\u2014was a testimonial communication within the meaning of <em>People </em>v. <em>Rucker </em>(1980) 26 Cal.3d 368, 380-386 [162 Cal.Rptr. 13, 605 P.2d 843], Its value to the prosecution depended on its content. <em>(Id., </em>at p. 382, fn. 11.) \u201c[T]he contents of appellant\u2019s disclosures were necessarily relevant to the purpose for which they were admitted. Only by examining whether his disclosures were responsive and accurate could anything be inferred about a lack of diminished capacity.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 384.) Because the state relied on the contents of appellant\u2019s speech to prove its case, it used this speech as a testimonial communication. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b781-11\">Thus, the state made use of the contents of a compelled testimonial communication in order to prove an element of the charged offense in violation of Whitt\u2019s privilege against self-incrimination. In the event of a retrial, Dr. Flanagan\u2019s testimony should not be admitted.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b781-5\">LUCAS, J.</author>\n<p id=\"As7\">I concur with the majority opinion to the extent it affirms defendant\u2019s conviction of murder and other lesser offenses. I dissent, however, from the majority\u2019s reversal of the special circumstances finding and the judgment of death. In my view, the death penalty was properly imposed for defendant\u2019s commission of murder during a robbery. (See Pen. Code, \u00a7 190.2, subd. (a)(17)(i).)</p>\n<p id=\"b781-6\">The majority relies upon <em>Carlos </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1983) 35 Cal.3d 131 [197 Cal.Rptr. 79, 672 P.2d 862], for the proposition that the foregoing felony-murder special circumstance provision impliedly requires an <em>intent to kill. </em>Although I did not participate in <em>Carlos, </em>I am convinced by the analysis contained in Justice Richardson\u2019s dissent in that case (see <em>id., </em>at pp. 156-160) that (1) neither the framers of nor the voters for the 1978 death penalty initiative contemplated the new law would require proof of an intent to kill in a felony-murder situation, and (2) imposition of the death penalty for felony murder is not prohibited by federal constitutional principles. No purpose would be served by reiterating Justice Richardson\u2019s analysis here.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-7\">Believing as I do that <em>Carlos </em>was incorrectly decided, a fortiori, I would not apply that case retroactively to all cases pending on appeal, nor would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"750\">*750</page-number>I impose the unrealistically rigid harmless error standards previously chosen by the majority. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Garcia </em>[(1984) <em>ante, </em>pp. 539, 554-556 (205 Cal.Rptr. 265, 684 P.2d 826)].) In sum, finding myself in total disagreement with both <em>Carlos </em>and <em>Garcia, </em>I must dissent to the majority\u2019s reliance upon those cases in reversing the judgment of death.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-4\">In addition, I also disagree with the majority\u2019s ruling, for guidance of the trial court on retrial, regarding the admissibility of Dr. Flanagan\u2019s testimony. <em>(Ante, </em>pp. 748-749, fn. 21.) Dr. Flanagan had viewed defendant\u2019s postarrest interview during which defendant asserted his <em>Miranda </em>rights. Rather than reveal the content or substance of <em>any </em>of defendant\u2019s statements, or even the fact that he had refused to talk with the officers without an attorney present, Dr. Flanagan merely testified that defendant seemed alert and observant, lacking any symptoms of mental illness or intoxication, and capable of taking a \u201cself-serving\u201d position, and \u201cchoos[ing] a course of action.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b782-5\">The majority holds the foregoing testimony entirely inadmissible on two wholly indefensible grounds. First, the majority complains that such testimony enabled the prosecutor to \u201cuse\u201d and therefore \u201cpenalize\u201d defendant\u2019s constitutionally protected right to refuse to incriminate himself. The serious and conclusive flaw in the majority\u2019s analysis is that Dr. Flanagan never testified regarding defendant\u2019s assertion of his constitutional rights. Instead, the doctor\u2019s testimony related generally to defendant\u2019s appearance, mental condition and capacity to reflect. No mention whatever was made of defendant\u2019s assertion of his <em>Miranda </em>rights or his refusal to cooperate with the officers.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-6\">Nor does the majority\u2019s second reason for barring such testimony withstand close scrutiny. According to the majority, Dr. Flanagan\u2019s testimony \u201cmade use of a compelled communication to provide evidence of Whitt\u2019s guilty mens rea. Whitt was compelled to speak in order to assert his constitutionally protected right to silence.\u201d As indicated above, however, no such forbidden \u201cuse\u201d occurred, for Dr. Flanagan made no reference to defendant\u2019s assertion of his constitutional rights, \u201ccompelled\u201d or otherwise. The majority\u2019s reliance upon <em>People </em>v. <em>Rucker </em>(1980) 26 Cal.3d 368, 380-386 [162 Cal.Rptr. 13, 605 P.2d 843], is wholly misplaced. In <em>Rucker, </em>the defendant\u2019s own tape-recorded statements were read to the jury, supposedly for the limited purpose of indicating his mental state. Because the officers had violated the defendant\u2019s <em>Miranda </em>rights, however, his statements were held inadmissible even for that limited purpose. In the present case, by contrast, none of defendant\u2019s statements were admitted in evidence; moreover, no <em>Miranda </em>violation ever occurred. <em>Rucker </em>is totally inapposite.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-7\">I suggest that the majority\u2019s footnote ruling will have a devastating effect upon the prosecution\u2019s ability in future cases to rebut a defendant\u2019s reliance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"751\">*751</page-number>upon so-called \u201cmental\u201d defenses. As I understand it, henceforth <em>all </em>testimony (presumably whether lay or expert) regarding the defendant\u2019s apparent mental condition or state of mind will be inadmissible if such testimony was based upon observing the accused in the course of a confrontation or interview culminating in his exercise of <em>Miranda </em>rights. Since such \u201cinterviews\u201d <em>frequently </em>terminate in that manner, the People will be deprived of critical, highly relevant evidence demonstrating the accused\u2019s state of mind at a time usually quite contemporaneous with the commission of the crime. Such a far-reaching ruling should not be relegated to a mere footnote for \u201cguidance\u201d on retrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-5\">I would affirm the judgment in its entirety.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
