Code, \u00a7 3500 et seq.) \u201cmeet-and-confer\u201d requirement (Gov. Code, \u00a7 3505) before it proposes an amendment to the city charter concerning the terms and conditions of public employment. We hold that the MMBA requirement must be met.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-12\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b626-13\">On March 8, 1977, the voters of the City of Seal Beach adopted three charter amendments.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> These amendments had been put on the ballot by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>city council pursuant to its constitutional power to propose charter amendments (Cal. Const., art. XI, \u00a7 3, subd. (b)). One amendment required the immediate firing, subject to an administrative hearing procedure, of any city employee who participated in a strike; it also prohibited the city council from granting amnesty or otherwise rehiring any striking public employee.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The adoption of the amendments was certified by the city council on March 28, 1977, and became effective on that date.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\">Relators\u2014several public employee unions and some of their officers\u2014 obtained leave to sue in quo warranto from the Attorney General.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> A complaint was filed on September 20, 1977. It sought a writ of quo warranto declaring the charter amendments invalid by reason of noncompliance with the \u201cmeet-and-confer\u201d requirement of Government Code section 3505.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> It prayed that the trial court (1) issue a writ of quo warranto ordering that the amendments be stricken; (2) make an order declaring the charter additions and amendments null and void; and (3) declare that certain sections of the Charter of the City of Seal Beach remain in force as they existed before the amendments. The actions were held in abeyance by stipulation of the parties pending a final decision by this court in <em>San Francisco Fire Fighters </em>v. <em>Board of Supervisors </em>(1979) 96 Cal.App.3d 538 [158 Cal.Rptr. 145], We eventually denied a hearing in that case.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The city then filed a general de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>murrer to the complaint, arguing that the city council had the absolute, unabridged constitutional authority to propose charter amendments to its electorate, which authority could not be impaired or limited by the requirements of the MMBA (Cal. Const., art. XI, \u00a7 3, subd. (b)).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The city\u2019s demurrer was based on the holding in <em>San Francisco Fire Fighters, </em>that San Francisco\u2019s Board of Supervisors did not have to meet and confer with employee representatives before proposing a charter amendment which, as here, concerned the terms and conditions of public employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-5\">The city\u2019s demurrer to the complaint was sustained and relators were given 30 days to amend. After they failed to do so, the matter was dismissed. Relators appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b628-7\">Section 3505 of the MMBA requires governing bodies of local agencies to \u201cmeet and confer [with employee representatives] in good faith regarding wages, hours, and other terms and conditions of employment\u201d and to \u201cconsider fully\u201d such presentations made by the employee organizations. Section 3505.1 provides that if the representatives successfully reach an agreement, a nonbinding memorandum of understanding shall be jointly prepared.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b628-8\">The meet-and-confer requirement means that \u201ca public agency, or such representatives as it may designate, and representatives of recognized employee organizations, shall have the mutual obligation personally to meet and confer promptly upon request by either party and continue for a reasonable period of time in order to exchange freely information, opinions, and proposals, and to endeavor to reach agreement on matters within the scope of representation prior to the adoption by the public agency of its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>final budget for the ensuing year.\u201d (\u00a7 3505.)  \u201cThough the process is not binding, it requires that the parties seriously \u2018attempt to resolve differences and reach a common ground.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Los Angeles County Civil Service Com. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1978) 23 Cal.3d 55, 61-62 [151 Cal.Rptr. 547, 588 P.2d 249], citing <em>Placentia Fire Fighters </em>v. <em>City of Placentia </em>(1976) 57 Cal.App.3d 9, 25 [129 Cal.Rptr. 126].)</p>\n<p id=\"b629-5\">The MMBA has two stated purposes: (1) to promote full communication between public employers and employees; and (2) to improve personnel management and employer-employee relations within the various public agencies. These purposes are to be accomplished by establishing methods for resolving disputes over employment conditions and by recognizing the right of public employees to organize and be represented by employee organizations. (\u00a7 3500.) While the Legislature established a procedure for resolving disputes regarding wages, hours and other conditions of employment, it did not attempt to establish standards for the wages, hours and other terms and conditions themselves. Rather, it \u201cset forth reasonable, proper and necessary principles which public agencies must follow in their rules and regulations for administering their employer-employee relations, . . .\u201d <em>(Los Angeles County Firefighters Local 1014 </em>v. <em>City of Monrovia </em>(1972) 24 Cal.App.3d 289, 295 [101 Cal.Rptr. 78].) Ambiguous language in section 3500 which seemingly leaves room for local legislation inconsistent with MMBA, has not been so interpreted.  \u201cAlthough the Legislature did not intend to preempt all aspects of labor relations in the public sector, we cannot attribute to it an intention to permit local entities to adopt regulations which would frustrate the declared policies and purposes of the MMB Act.\u201d <em>(Huntington Beach Police Officers\u2019 Assn. </em>v. <em>City of Huntington Beach </em>(1976) 58 Cal.App.3d 491, 501-502 [129 Cal.Rptr. 893].)  Finally, the Legislature clearly intended that the MMBA apply to charter cities: a public agency under section 3501, subdivision (c) includes \u201cevery town, city, county, city and county and municipal corporation, whether incorporated or not and whether chartered or not.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b629-7\">The simple question posed by this case is whether the unchallenged constitutional power of a charter city\u2019s governing body to propose charter amendments may be used to circumvent the legislatively designed methods of accomplishing the goals of MMBA.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-8\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b629-9\">Seal Beach argues that the meet-and-confer requirement of the MMBA is incompatible with the charter amendment provisions contained in article XI, section 3 of the California Constitution. (See fn. 6, <em>ante.) </em>It contends that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>the central issue in this case is whether the Legislature may, by statute, restrict or qualify a right or power expressly reserved to a charter city by the Constitution. It points out\u2014correctly\u2014that this issue was squarely decided in its favor in <em>San Francisco Fire Fighters </em>v. <em>Board of Supervisors, supra, 96 </em>Cal.App.3d 538.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-5\">Article XI, section 3, subdivision (b), of the California Constitution does, of course, give the governing body of a charter city the right to propose charter amendments to the electorate; <em>San Francisco Fire Fighters </em>held that this right could not be abridged by the Legislature and that therefore the MMBA meet-and-confer requirement could not be enforced. The court stated that \u201c[w]e discern ... a clear purpose that when a county\u2019s, or city\u2019s, governing body shall find it to be in the public interest to propose a specific charter amendment for adoption by the electorate, it shall have the absolute and untrammeled right and duty to do so. Just as clearly appears a corollary intent that such charter amendment proposals, or the decision whether they be made at all, shall not be the product of bargaining and compromise between the public entity\u2019s representatives, and others.\u201d <em>(San Francisco Fire Fighters, supra, 96 </em>Cal.App.3d at p. 548.)</p>\n<p id=\"b630-6\">It is a truism that few legal rights are so \u201cabsolute and untrammeled\u201d that they can never be subjected to peaceful coexistence with other rules. Thus in <em>Los Angeles County Civil Service Com. </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>23 Cal.3d at pages 65-66, we reconciled a charter provision which mandated that civil service rules be amended only after public hearings, with the meet- and-confer provisions of the MMBA, although under article XI, section 3, subdivision (a) the charter provision superseded all \u201cinconsistent\u201d laws. \u201cWe conclude that the meet-and-confer requirement can coexist with the charter-mandated hearing. We see no reason why the commission\u2019s integrity as a neutral administrator of the merit system would be jeopardized by its participating in bargaining sessions with union and management representatives.\u201d (I<em>d. </em>at pp. 65-66.)</p>\n<p id=\"b630-7\">The city, however, claims that the MMBA cannot be harmonized with its constitutional right to propose charter amendments. First, it asserts that any regulation which affects this right is invalid. Under this argument, the city\u2019s power to amend its charter is so absolute that it is irrelevant that a legislative enactment which purports to affect it, does not actually conflict with this power.  The law, however, is that a city\u2019s power to amend its charter can be subject to legislative regulation. <em>(District Election etc. Committee </em>v. <em>O\u2019Connor </em>(1978) 78 Cal.App.3d 261, 267 [144 Cal.Rptr. 442].) That case squarely held that \u201cthe regulation of the charter amendment process is a matter of statewide concern governed exclusively by general laws which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>supersede conflicting provisions in a city and county charter.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 267.)  Thus, the argument that the procedure for putting charter amendments on the ballot is sacrosanct and immune to legislative control has already been rejected. We agree with the holding in <em>District Election, </em>which makes this an a fortiori case: in <em>District Election </em>there was an actual conflict between a state statute\u2014section 34459 of the Government Code\u2014 and the relevant charter provision concerning the number of signatures required to put an amendment on the ballot through the initiative process.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Section 3505 is, of course, far less intrusive. Cities function both as employers and as democratic organs of government. The meet-and-confer requirement is an essential component of the state\u2019s legislative scheme for regulating the city\u2019s employment practices. By contrast, the burden on the city\u2019s democratic functions is minimal.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-5\">Second, the city claims that any attempt to harmonize the meet-and-confer process with the procedure for proposing charter amendments rests on a misguided effort \u201cto transmogrify this case into one involving \u2018pre-emption\u2019 of local regulations dealing with matters of statewide concern.\u201d We disagree. We are fully aware that the dichotomy to which the city refers\u2014state preemption v. municipal affair\u2014would, as such, become relevant only if relators had mounted an attack on the power of the city to enact the substance of the three charter amendments. As already noted (see fn. 2, <em>ante), </em>they have not done so. Yet there is an undeniable parallel between the issue in this case and issues which our courts face in connection with various aspects of the MMBA on an almost daily basis: to what extent is a constitutional grant of power so absolute, that it must remain totally unaffected by even the most vital legislative concerns? On this question the cases in which legislative enactments confront the municipal \u201chome rule\u201d rights of charter cities and counties (Cal. Const., art. XI, \u00a7 5) are indeed instructive.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-6\">If the city is correct and the MMBA cannot affect the city council\u2019s constitutional power to propose charter amendments, much law concerning the impact of the act on charter cities will have to be rewritten. Article XI, section 5, subdivision (b) of the California Constitution<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> permits city charters to provide for \u201cthe constitution, regulation and government of the city <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>police force,\u201d and grants \u201cplenary authority\u201d to provide for \u201cthe manner in which, the method by which, the times at which, and the terms for which the several municipal officers and employees whose compensation is paid by the city shall be elected or appointed, and for their removal, and for their compensation, and for the number of deputies, clerks, and other employees that each shall have, and for the compensation, method of appointment, qualifications, tenure of office and removal of such deputies, clerks and other employees.\u201d What grant of power could sound more absolute? Yet in an unbroken series of public employee cases, starting with <em>Professional Fire Fighters, Inc. </em>v. <em>City of Los Angeles </em>(1963) 60 Cal.2d 276, 289-295 [32 Cal.Rptr. 830, 384 P.2d 158] and ending for the time being with <em>Baggett </em>v. <em>Gates </em>(1982) 32 Cal.3d 128, 135, 140 [185 Cal.Rptr. 232, 649 P.2d 874], it has been held that a \u201cgeneral law prevails over local enactments of a chartered city, even in regard to matters which would otherwise be deemed to be strictly municipal affairs, where the subject matter of the general law is of statewide concern.\u201d <em>(Professional Fire Fighters, supra, </em>60 Cal.2d at p. 292.)<footnotemark>10</footnotemark>\n                   Fair labor practices, uniform throughout the state, are a matter \u201cof the same statewide concern as workmen\u2019s compensation, liability of municipalities for tort, perfecting and filing of claims, and the requirement to subscribe to loyalty oaths.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 294-295.) With these precepts in mind, in <em>Professional Firefighters </em>we resolved a conflict between the statutory right of firemen to organize and the city\u2019s \u201ccharter provisions, ordinances and regulations\u201d <em>(id. </em>at p. 290) in favor of the statute. In <em>Baggett </em>v. <em>Gates, supra, </em>32 Cal.3d 128, we held it to be of no consequence that the Public Safety Officers\u2019 Procedural Bill of Rights Act (\u00a7\u00a7 3300-3311) conflicted with and impinged on a charter city\u2019s power to determine the manner in which its employees could be removed and, generally, impinged \u201cto a limited extent on the city\u2019s general regulatory power over the [police] department. \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 138.)  In the same vein, in <em>Huntington Beach Police Officers\u2019 Assn. </em>v. <em>City of Huntington Beach </em>(1976) 58 Cal.App.3d 492 [129 Cal.Rptr. 893], a charter city resolution purporting to exclude work hour schedules from the meet-and-confer process was held invalid.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b633-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>All these cases involved actual conflicts between state statutes and city \u201claw.\u201d  No such conflict exists between the city council\u2019s power to propose charter amendments and section 3505. Although that section encourages binding agreements resulting from the parties\u2019 bargaining, the governing body of the agency\u2014here the city council\u2014retains the ultimate power to refuse an agreement and to make its own decision. (See <em>Glendale City Employees\u2019 Assn., Inc. </em>v. <em>City of Glendale </em>(1975) 15 Cal.3d 328, 334-336 [124 Cal.Rptr. 513, 540 P.2d 609],)<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> This power preserves the council\u2019s rights under article XI, section 3, subdivision (b)\u2014 it may still propose a charter amendment if the meet-and-confer process does not persuade it otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-5\">We therefore conclude that the meet-and-confer requirement of section 3505 is compatible with the city council\u2019s constitutional power to propose charter amendments.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b633-7\">The city asserts a separate and independent ground articulated in <em>San Francisco Fire Fighters </em>as a basis for affirmance of the trial court\u2019s judgment. <em>San Francisco Fire Fighters </em>held that section 3504 provides a charter city with an express exemption from the requirements of the MMBA. Section 3504 defines the scope of representation to include \u201call matters relating to the employment conditions and employer-employee relations, including, but not limited to, wages, hours, and other terms and conditions of employment, except, however, that the scope of representation shall not include consideration of the merits, necessity, or organization of any service or activity provided by law or executive order.\u201d The court in <em>San Francisco Fire Fighters </em>stated: \u201c[T]he Legislature enacted Government <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>Code section 3504 to provide that the Meyers-Milias-Brown Act\u2019s duty to \u2018meet and confer\u2019 did \u2018not include consideration of the merits [or] necessity . . . of any . . . activity provided by law . . . .\u2019 [Fn. omitted.] In the case at bench, proposal of charter amendments deemed appropriate by San Francisco\u2019s governing body was an activity provided by the highest law of the state, i.e., its Constitution. Under section.3504 consideration of the <em>merits </em>or <em>necessity </em>of such a proposal was <em>expressly </em>exempted from the \u2018meet and confer\u2019 requirements of the Meyers-Milias-Brown Act.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>96 Cal.App.3d at pp. 548-549.)</p>\n<p id=\"b634-5\">This interpretation of section 3504, however, differs from that of other courts, commentators and of this court. First, the qualifying language of section 3504 was adopted as part of the 1968 amendments \u201cpresumably as a protection against the expanded concept of bargaining which those amendments embraced\u2014but its meaning is far from clear\u201d (Grodin, <em>Public Employee Bargaining in California: The Meyers-Milias-Brown Act in the Courts </em>(1972) 23 Hastings L.J. 719, 750.) In <em>Fire Fighters Union </em>v. <em>City of Vallejo </em>(1974) 12 Cal.3d 608, 615-616 [116 Cal.Rptr. 507, 526 P.2d 971], we concluded that the language merely indicated the Legislature\u2019s intent to \u201cforestall any expansion of the language of \u2018wages, hours and working conditions\u2019 to include more general managerial policy decisions.\u201d (See also <em>Huntington Beach Police Officers\u2019 Assn. </em>v. <em>City of Huntington Beach, supra, </em>58 Cal.App.3d 492, 503-504.) If proposing charter amendments is an activity provided by law, so is just about every aspect of employer-employee relations in the public sector. As the Court of Appeal said in this case: \u201cTaken to its logical extreme, this argument would lead to the conclusion that all employment proposals are exempt under the qualifying language of section 3504. This result is obviously untenable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b634-6\">VI</p>\n<p id=\"b634-7\">We conclude that the city council was required to meet and confer with the relators before it proposed charter amendments which affect matters within their scope of representation. The MMBA requires such action and the city council cannot avoid the requirement by use of its right to propose charter amendments.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-8\">We are satisfied that relators\u2019 action meets the requirement of section 1021.5 of the Code of Civil Procedure. <em>(Baggett </em>v. <em>Gates </em>(1982) 32 Cal.3d 128, 142-143 [185 Cal.Rptr. 232, 649 P.2d 874].) They are therefore entitled to recover attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>The judgment is reversed. The trial court is directed to enter an order overruling the demurrer and to award relators an appropriate amount for attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-5\">Bird, C. J., Mosk, J., Broussard, J., Reynoso, J., Grodin, J., and Lucas, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b626-14\">The amendments affected two existing sections of the charter\u2014912 and 913\u2014and added a new section, 912.1.

Section 13 of the article provides, however, in relevant part: \u201cThe terms general law, general laws, and laws, as used in this Article, shall be construed as a continuation and restatement of those terms as used in the Constitution in effect immediately prior to the effective date of this amendment, and not as effecting a change in meaning.\u201d (See also <em>Sonoma County Organization of Public Employees </em>v. <em>County of Sonoma </em>(1979) 23 Cal.3d 296, 317 [152 Cal.Rptr. 903, 591 P.2d 1].)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b632-8\">We emphasize that there is a clear distinction between the <em>substance </em>of a public employee labor issue and the <em>procedure </em>by which it is resolved. Thus there is no question that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>\u201csalaries of local employees of a charter city constitute municipal affairs and are not subject to general laws.\u201d <em>(Sonoma County Organization of Public Employees </em>v. <em>County of Sonoma, supra, </em>23 Cal.3d at p. 317.) Nevertheless, the process by which salaries are fixed is obviously a matter of statewide concern and none could, at this late stage, argue that a charter city need not meet and confer concerning its salary structure.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b633-9\">The logical consequence of the city\u2019s position is, actually, that the MMBA cannot be applied to charter cities at all. If a meet-and-confer session with the city council concerning contemplated charter amendments impinges on the council\u2019s constitutional power, what of salary ordinances? It is \u201cfirmly established that the mode and manner of passing ordinances is a municipal affair . . . and that there can be no implied limitations upon charter powers concerning municipal affairs.\u201d <em>(Adler </em>v. <em>City Council </em>(1960) 184 Cal.App.2d 763, 776-777 [7 Cal.Rptr. 805].) If meeting and conferring on charter amendments is an illegal limitations on the city council\u2019s power, why is the same not true of any ordinance which affects \u201cterms and conditions of public employment?\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
