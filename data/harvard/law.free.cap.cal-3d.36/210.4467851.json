Defendants claim that the cofelon\u2019s death proximately resulted from his own provocative conduct, for which, under our decisions, they cannot be held vicariously liable. More broadly, they wish us to reconsider the now settled rule that, though the felony-murder rule does not extend to killings by victims or police, such killings which proximately result from provocative conduct by one of the felons which exhibits a conscious disregard for life and a high probability of resulting in death constitute murder without the necessity of any \u201cimputation\u201d of malice. The record discloses substantial evidence of malicious conduct by the defendants themselves, and we decline their invitation to reconsider settled decisional law. Accordingly, we will affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">About 7:15 p.m. on January 28, 1980, a man wearing a gray overcoat and dark glasses, subsequently identified as Anthony Belvin (the murder victim), approached the patio window of a Church\u2019s Fried Chicken outlet and placed an order, indicating that a companion would pay. The latter was wearing a blue jacket and was later identified as defendant Washington. Washington approached the window, then walked to the rear of the building, returned to speak to Belvin, and then walked to another window as though intending to pay for the order. Belvin then revealed a sawed-off shotgun, pointed it at one of the employees, and announced a holdup. Belvin ordered the employees to lie down on the ground and forced one of them to open one of the cash registers and hand over the contents ($24). While the employee attempted to open a second register at Belvin\u2019s behest, Washington entered the building through one of the counter windows and approached the manager\u2019s office carrying a handgun. The manager was already in telephone contact with the sheriff\u2019s department, having retreated to his office when he saw the robbers (whom he thought he recognized from a previous robbery) approaching the place. When the manager failed to open his door, Washington returned to the front of the establishment and left with Belvin.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>Within seconds after the men fled, a patrol car containing Deputies Morris Boothroyd and Ronald Trujillo arrived. After one of the employees indicated in which direction the robbers had gone, Deputy Boothroyd saw a man in a blue jacket entering a brown automobile which pulled away from the curb very rapidly, so much so that the tires lost traction on the road\u2019s surface. The deputies activated their lights and siren and gave chase.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">The brown car, driven without headlights, was pursued by an increasing number of patrol cars over a twisting course for 5 to 10 miles at speeds up to 70 miles per hour. During the chase, it drove through several stop signs and red lights, once skidded out of control, and nearly collided with another car. At an intersection, the suspects\u2019 auto struck a sheriff\u2019s vehicle coming from a side street and continued. Two more radio cars containing Deputies Steven Maggiora and Robert Lopez and Deputies Milkey and Bruton, joined the pursuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-6\">A fourth sheriff\u2019s vehicle, carrying Deputies James McSweeney and Patrick Hunter, came on the scene in front of the suspects\u2019 car, traveling in the opposite direction. The brown car initially veered toward the patrol car, then slowed almost to a stop and pulled toward the opposite curb. Suddenly the deputies noticed that the passenger in the right front seat (Washington) was pointing a shotgun at them. Instinctively, Deputy Hunter accelerated and rammed the suspects\u2019 car head-on. The shotgun discharged and flew out of Washington\u2019s hands, skidding away from the auto. Deputy Boothroyd pulled up directly behind the brown car, which rolled backward a short distance and came to rest against the patrol car\u2019s front bumper. The other sheriffs\u2019 cars parked a little behind and to the right of Boothroyd\u2019s and Trujillo\u2019s car.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-7\">The deputies alighted immediately and took cover with guns drawn. A moment later, they saw the rear-seat passenger (Belvin) lean forward and put his hand out the window with a revolver in it. At the same time, Deputy McSweeney saw the driver (defendant Caldwell) open his door and crouch behind it carrying a recognizable handgun. Deputy Hunter watched Washington as he took cover behind a door post and formed the impression that he, too, had a weapon, in view of the way he kept watching the deputy rather than seeking better cover (but it is apparently undisputed that Washington was unarmed at this point). Belvin moved his gun back and forth in a sweeping motion, ignoring repeated orders to \u201cfreeze\u201d and \u201cdrop the gun.\u201d When Belvin took aim at two of the deputies and failed to respond to a last order to drop his weapon, Deputy Hunter fired at him, then at Washington. The rest of the deputies also fired at the car at about the same time (though Hunter is the only one of those who testified who did not state that he heard one or more shots before firing). When the shooting started, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>Deputy McSweeney focused his attention on Caldwell and shot at him when, instead of dropping his gun, he looked in the direction of Me Sweeney\u2019s partner. Estimates of the time between the ramming of the suspects\u2019 car to the firing of the first shot ranged from 5 to 40 seconds.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-4\">After the gunfire ended the suspects were removed from their vehicle. Belvin had been wounded, and he died the next morning. Tests indicated that Deputy Lopez\u2019 gun probably fired the fatal bullet. Belvin\u2019s revolver had not been fired, and Caldwell\u2019s was not found.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">Both defendants testified in their own defense. Washington testified that he passed out from a PCP cigarette at Belvin\u2019s residence sometime before the robbery and could recall nothing further until he woke up in the hospital several days later. Caldwell testified that Belvin induced him to drive him and Washington to the fried chicken outlet with a promise to pay Caldwell some money he owed him. Caldwell assertedly had no idea that Belvin had committed a robbery until the police arrived and Belvin pointed the shotgun at him and threatened to shoot him if he did not drive away in an effort to elude the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b246-7\"> Defendants contend that their murder convictions are not supported by substantial evidence. Although the killing of their confederate, Belvin, occurred as a culmination of their unsuccessful attempt to escape after a robbery, it is conceded that the felony-murder rule has no application here since Belvin was not killed by defendants, but by a deputy sheriff in the pursuit of his duty. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Washington </em>(1965) 62 Cal.2d <em>777, </em>783 [44 Cal.Rptr. 442, 402 P.2d 130].) Defendants correctly point out that they could be found guilty of murder based on such a killing only if one or both of them were shown to have intentionally committed acts which it was highly probable would result in death, manifesting a conscious disregard of human life, or malice. <em>(Id., </em>at p. 782; <em>People </em>v. <em>Gilbert </em>(1965) 63 Cal.2d 690, 703-705 [47 Cal.Rptr. 909, 408 P.2d 365];<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>(1970) 3 Cal.3d 578 [91 Cal.Rptr. 275, 477 P.2d 131].) They assert that it was Belvin\u2019s act of pointing a gun out the window of the car that precipitated the deputies\u2019 fire, and that they themselves did nothing which could be characterized as likely to result in death; since they are not liable for Belvin\u2019s malicious conduct <em>(People </em>v. <em>Antick </em>(1975) 15 Cal.3d 79, 90-91 [123 Cal.Rptr. 475, 539 P.2d 43]), they insist the murder convictions cannot stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">Their argument fails because the major premise is inaccurate. The fundamental problem with defendants\u2019 contention is that it requires a misapplication of the \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d rule to sustain it.  In reviewing a claim of insufficiency of the evidence, an appellate court \u201c \u2018must view the evidence in a light most favorable to the respondent and presume in support of the judgment the existence of every fact the trier could reasonably deduce from the evidence.\u2019 [Citations.]\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Johnson </em>(1980) 26 Cal.3d 557, 576 [162 Cal.Rptr. 431, 606 P.2d 738, 16 A.L.R.4th 1255].) \u201c \u2018The test on appeal is whether substantial evidence supports the conclusion of the trier of fact, not whether the evidence proves guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. Evidence, to be \u2018substantial\u2019 must be \u2018of ponderable legal significance . . . reasonable in nature, credible, and of solid value.\u2019 [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em> A review of the record discloses substantial evidence of malicious conduct on the part of both defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-7\">Washington\u2019s suggestion that he did not commit \u201cany acts . . . which were likely to cause death\u201d seems utterly fantastic. The record reflects that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>he pointed a shotgun at Deputies Hunter and McSweeney as their patrol car approached from the front and was, from all that appears, prevented from shooting them only by Hunter\u2019s reflexive acceleration and ramming of the suspects\u2019 automobile. In fact, as previously noted, the shotgun discharged at about the moment of impact, though no one was hit, and it flew out of Washington\u2019s hands and skittered across the pavement. (Washington\u2019s more plausible argument that, malicious or not, his action with the shotgun was not a proximate cause of the subsequent shooting is considered, infra.)</p>\n<p id=\"b248-4\">Caldwell does not dispute the testimony that he drove the getaway car without headlights on a rainy evening at speeds up to 70 miles per hour and passed through a number of stop signs and red lights, losing control more than once and colliding with other cars. In view of the jury\u2019s implicit rejection of his duress defense, this in itself could constitute substantial evidence of malice. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Fuller </em>(1978) 86 Cal.App.3d 618, 628-629 [150 Cal.Rptr. 515]; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Watson </em>(1981) 30 Cal.3d 290 [179 Cal.Rptr. 43, 637 P.2d 279].) (Again, a more serious issue of proximate causation remains to be discussed.)</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">Beyond that, though, there is Deputy McSweeney\u2019s testimony that, after the car was finally stopped (by a head-on collision with the car in which the deputy was riding) and Washington lost the shotgun, there was movement in the car, after which Caldwell exited the car and took a position of cover behind the door post with a gun in his hand, and then proceeded to ignore various commands to drop his gun, just as Belvin was doing. When the shooting started, McSweeney fired at Caldwell in response to the latter\u2019s fixing his attention on McSweeney\u2019s partner\u2019s position. The jury could reasonably infer that by the foregoing conduct Caldwell and Belvin manifested a concerted determination not to surrender and a readiness instead to shoot it out with their pursuers. In <em>People </em>v. <em>Reed </em>(1969) 270 Cal.App.2d 37 [75 Cal.Rptr. 430], the defendant was held to have initiated a gun battle by pointing his gun toward a policeman and toward the robbery victim, the appellate court remarking that \u201c[s]uch aggressive actions required immediate reaction unless an officer is to be held to the unreasonable requirement that an armed robber be given the courtesy of the first shot.\u201d (Id., at p. 45.) Although Caldwell was not given a chance to do more than look toward Deputy Hunter\u2019s position, the jury could reasonably conclude that he had already, by emerging from the car with a gun and taking cover and then refusing to drop the gun, exhibited unambiguously his aggressive intentions, so that it was plain to Deputy McSweeney, observing him, that when Caldwell looked toward McSweeney\u2019s partner, it was because he was about to fire at him.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-6\">Recognizing the damaging effect of Detective McSweeney\u2019s testimony, defendants diffidently suggest that we simply ignore it since none of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>other deputies who testified saw the gun, and it was not found at the scene. While the lack of corroboration undoubtedly might have alfected the weight of the witness\u2019 testimony, it cannot be said that the fact that no gun was found renders it \u201cphysically impossible\u201d or \u201cinherently improbable.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Pearson </em>(1969) 70 Cal.2d 218, 221 [74 Cal.Rptr. 281, 449 P.2d 217]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Lyons </em>(1956) 47 Cal.2d 311, 319-320 [303 P.2d 329]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Huston </em>(1943) 21 Cal.2d 690, 693 [134 P.2d 758].) We note that three of the officers involved, including Deputy Lopez whose gun probably fired the fatal bullet, did not testify at trial. The incidents in question occurred on a rainy winter evening, so a handgun thrown away some distance from the suspect\u2019s car might conceivably have been missed.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">The question remains whether the killing of Belvin was \u201cattributable\u201d to the malicious acts of either or both of the defendants\u2014i.e., whether it <em>proximately resulted </em>from said conduct. (See <em>Pizano </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1978) 21 Cal.3d 128, 136-138 [145 Cal.Rptr. 524, 577 P.2d 659]; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Gilbert, supra, </em>63 Cal.2d at pp. 704-705.) Defendants insist that Belvin\u2019s actions, ignoring the commands to drop his gun, and aiming at two deputies, were the sole cause of his death, but for which the officers would not have fired. All of the deputies who testified cited Belvin\u2019s actions as forming at least part of their reasons for opening fire. The jury might have concluded on the evidence that there was more than one proximate cause of the killing, however.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">A difficult problem is presented when we examine the causal relationship between Caldwell\u2019s dangerous getaway driving and Washington\u2019s malicious and provocatory act of aiming a shotgun at Deputies Hunter and McSweeney and the shootout that followed. On one hand, it is undisputed that the deputies did not begin firing immediately, but gave the robbers a chance to surrender. Two of the four deputies who testified, Boothroyd and Maggiora, specifically testified that Washington\u2019s act was not a motivating factor in their decisions to fire. Deputy McSweeney stated that Caldwell\u2019s actions <em>after </em>the car stopped were the reason he fired. Though Deputy Hunter was concerned that Washington might have rearmed himself, even he did not cite the aiming of the shotgun as one of his reasons for opening fire. Therefore, to conclude that Caldwell\u2019s driving or Washington\u2019s act was a \u201cbut for\u201d cause of Belvin\u2019s death might require some rather heroic inferences on the part of the jury. On the other hand, as little as five or six seconds may have elapsed between the collision and Washington\u2019s dropping of the shotgun and the deputies\u2019 opening fire. Though the deputies did not begin firing immediately, but gave the suspects an opportunity to drop their guns, it can hardly be said that whatever provocative force the high-speed chase and Washington\u2019s apparent attempt to shoot two policemen may have had dissipated, or \u201ccome to rest in a position of apparent safety.\u201d (Perkins &amp; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>Boyce, Criminal Law (3d ed. 1982) at pp. 790-781.) The lull in the action was precarious and short-lived, and at least one deputy, Boothroyd, did count the chase and the fact that Washington had \u201cproduced\u201d a weapon a few seconds before among his reasons for fearing for his and his compatriots\u2019 safety just after the suspects\u2019 car was stopped.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Thus, a reasonable trier of fact could have concluded that the officers\u2019 lethal response was provoked by a violent confrontation which was the product of the actions of both Caldwell and Washington, as well as those of Belvin.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b250-4\">The jury might also reasonably have inferred that Belvin would have been unwilling to provoke a gun battle if Caldwell had not similarly adopted an aggressive stance, refusing to drop his gun. It may have concluded that the co-felons\u2019 conduct reflected a common determination not to surrender, and the several acts of resistance were interdependent. Caldwell\u2019s acts may thus also have been a \u201cbut for\u201d cause (in fact) of the gun battle and Belvin\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">To be considered a <em>proximate </em>cause of Belvin\u2019s death, the acts of the defendants must have been a \u201csubstantial factor\u201d contributing to the result. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Scola </em>(1976) 56 Cal.App.3d 723, 726 [128 Cal.Rptr. 477]; Perkins &amp; Boyce, Criminal Law, <em>supra, </em>at pp. 779-780; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Vernon </em>(1979) 89 Cal.App.3d 853, 864 [152 Cal.Rptr. 765] [a number of defendants concurrently contributed to victim\u2019s death by kicking].) \u201c[N]o cause will receive juridical recognition if the part it played was so infinitesimal or so theoretical that it cannot properly be regarded as a <em>substantial factor </em>in bringing about the particular result. This is merely a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>special application of the general <em>maxim\u2014'de minimis non curat </em>lex\u2019 ...\u201d (Perkins &amp; Boyce, <em>supra, </em>at p. 779.)  The fact that one of the deputies who testified was primarily concerned about Caldwell\u2019s actions after the car stopped and their inferential importance to Belvin, and that another reacted to Washington\u2019s brandishing of the shotgun, militate in favor of recognizing said acts as a substantial factor in bringing about the gun battle and Belvin\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-6\">Decisions in cases involving conduct of more than one co-felon acting in concert reflect the settled view that the extent of an individual\u2019s contribution to the resulting death need not be minutely determined.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-7\">Thus, in <em>In re Tyrone B. </em>(1976) 58 Cal.App.3d 884 [130 Cal.Rptr. 245], the defendant and an accomplice (the victim) entered a store intending to rob it. The accomplice hit the clerk in the head with a shovel handle, and the defendant shoved him into a display stand and stabbed him. As the accomplice continued to beat him, the clerk produced a pistol and killed him. The appellate court rejected a claim that the accomplice\u2019s actions were the sole cause of his death, finding it sufficient that the defendant actively participated with his confederate in a simultaneous assault on the clerk. (Id., at pp. 888-890.)</p>\n<p id=\"b251-8\">Similarly, in <em>People </em>v. <em>Velasquez </em>(1975) 53 Cal.App.3d 547 [126 Cal.Rptr. 11], it did not matter that the defendant\u2019s brother (the deceased) was not shot until he directly indicated, in response to repeated warnings, that he would not stop beating the deputy\u2019s partner. The altercation began when the defendant resisted an arrest, and his brother soon appeared to try to rescue him. They managed to relieve both deputies of their batons and together set to beating one of the deputies senseless. The other, after repeated warnings to stop, shot the defendant\u2019s brother. The appellate court stated that the latter did not alone cause his death; the defendant\u2019s acts in initially resisting arrest and his participation in the assault on one of the deputies constituted malicious conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-9\">Finally, and most helpfully, in <em>People </em>v. <em>Claflin </em>(1978) 87 Cal.App.3d 1 [150 Cal.Rptr. 693], an order setting aside under section 995 a portion of an information charging defendants with murder and attempted murder was reversed on the basis of the appellate court\u2019s rejection of the superior court\u2019s characterization of the defendants as essentially \u201cperipheral.\u201d Although their confederate who was killed was apparently the main motive force behind the confrontation which ended in his death, the court found sufficient evidence of malicious conduct by the defendants. After an initial altercation involving the three defendants and the deceased, one Moats, on one side, and two off-duty deputy sheriffs on the other, which arose out of a rock-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>throwing incident and culminated in one of the deputies having to draw his gun, the deceased withdrew with the defendants, asking whether he should get his gun. The deputies called the police. Before they arrived, the defendants and Moats returned, the latter taking up a position behind a truck, aiming at one of the deputies, and the defendants charged him. The deputy sidestepped a blow by one of them and shot another who tried to take his gun, then shot Moats before the latter could shoot him. The appellate court held that inasmuch as all the defendants charged the deputy knowing that he and Moats both had guns, \u201ceach of them was engaging in conduct indisputably provocative of potentially lethal gunfire.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 6.) Their conduct in attacking the deputy \u201cset the stage for the shootout that followed,\u201d and, critically, the court found the inference reasonable \u201cthat Moats would not have charged the [deputies\u2019] location and attempted such a potentially dangerous confrontation had the defendants not accompanied him. . . .\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b252-4\">The foregoing instructive decisions persuade us that defendants\u2019 malicious conduct of fleeing in a dangerous high-speed chase, confronting the officers with a dangerous weapon when the chase ended and further preparing to shoot it out with the deputies was a proximate cause of Belvin\u2019s death,  Moreover, all of these acts were reasonably in furtherance of the robbery, as their evident purpose was to permit the robbers to escape.  Consequently, the evidence supports a determination that Caldwell and Washington were liable for the murder of Belvin.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">Defendants invite us fundamentally to reconsider the <em>Washington-Gilbert </em>doctrine of liability for killings committed directly by persons other than the co-felons, in view of \u201cthe clear modern trend [of decisions] . . . away from the \u2018proximate cause\u2019 theory as a basis for felony-murder liability.\u201d They unaccountably fail to note that our holding in <em>People </em>v. <em>Washington, supra, </em>62 Cal.2d 777, was precisely that the felony-murder rule extends only to killings perpetrated by felons, notwithstanding the fact that killings by others might be a foreseeable risk of committing the underlying felony, so that it might be regarded as a proximate cause of the killing. (62 Cal.2d at p. 781.) In <em>Washington, </em>we recognized that \u201c[t]he felony-murder rule has been criticized on the grounds that in almost all cases in which it is applied it is unnecessary and that it erodes the relation between criminal liability and moral culpability.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 783.) We have recognized that the felony-murder doctrine \u201cexpresses a highly artificial concept that de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>serves no extension beyond its required application, \u201d in \u201cimposing] malice as to one crime because of [a] defendant\u2019s commission of another . . . <em>(People </em>v. <em>Phillips </em>(1966) 64 Cal.2d 574, 582-583; see <em>People </em>v. <em>Dillon </em>(1983) 34 Cal.3d 441 [194 Cal.Rptr. 390, 668 P.2d 697] [this court\u2019s most recent discussion and affirmation of the felony-murder rule].) Although defendants argue that the <em>Washington-Gilbert </em>line of decisions results in a similar cleavage between culpability and criminal liability, their contention does not bear scrutiny. It is simply inaccurate to say, as they do, that under the <em>Washington-Gilbert </em>rule of liability, \u201cwhere a causal chain can be drawn between a defendant\u2019s course of conduct and the death, the homicide and malice are imputed to the defendant and the prosecution is relieved of its burden to establish proof of actus reus and mens rea for murder liability.\u201d Contrary to their claim, a common sense recognition of the idea that an act should be considered in the light of its natural and foreseeable results when they occur (see Perkins &amp; Boyce, <em>supra, </em>at p. 806) does not <em>preclude </em>inquiry into the felons\u2019 subjective knowledge of the likely result of their actions; rather, it <em>informs </em>the inquiry. The proper focus on the individual culpability of accomplices is retained by the requirement that one or more of them engage in conduct which it is <em>highly probable </em>(not merely foreseeable) will result in death, evincing a <em>conscious disregard </em>of human life. (See Note, <em>Criminal Liability of a Participant in Crime for the Death of a Fellow Participant </em>(1970-1971) 22 Syracuse L.Rev. 1065, 1077.) Only where one or more of the co-felons has thus exhibited a culpable, murderous state of mind does a resulting death predicate liability for murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">The fact that subtle distinctions sometimes have to be made in deciding whether conduct goes beyond commission of the underlying felony (see <em>In re Joe R. </em>(1980) 27 Cal.3d 496, 506, fn. 6, 508 [165 Cal.Rptr. 837, 612 P.2d 927]) does not require us to jettison the doctrine; certainly defendants\u2019 suggestion that their own conduct did not go beyond commission of a robbery requires no discriminating analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-7\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b253-8\">Defendant Caldwell also complains that the standard instructions given by the trial court on aider and abettor liability\u2014CALJIC Nos. 3.00<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>and 3.01<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>\u2014were erroneous in failing to inform the jury that an aider and abettor must have a \u201ccriminal intent,\u201d in addition to having knowledge of the perpetrator\u2019s purpose and aiding, promoting, encouraging or instigating the commission of the crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-4\">These instructions do not accurately reflect the intent required of an aider and abettor. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Beeman </em>(1984) 35 Cal.3d 547 [199 Cal.Rptr. 60, 674 P.2d 1318].) In this case, however, the error did not preclude the jury from considering and determining the question of Caldwell\u2019s intent. The defense was duress, upon which principle the jury was properly instructed in accordance with CALJIC No. 4.40.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The essence of his defense was that because he acted only because he had been threatened he did not have a criminal intent in driving Washington and Belvin away from the scene of the robbery and attempting to elude the pursuit; i.e., though he intended to facilitate the commission of the robbery, he did so only out of fear for his life. The jury evidently rejected this defense version of events in which Caldwell allegedly acted without criminal intent. Hence, the challenged instruction could not have affected the jury deliberation and verdict.

They can be reconciled. The jury may have decided that Washington was prevented from \u201cusing\u201d the shotgun when the patrol car rammed the suspects\u2019 vehicle and it flew out of his hands.

The trial court rejected Washington\u2019s argument that the verdicts against him were fatally inconsistent.

I write separately to express a narrower view of what I consider the crucial evidence. Given the short span of time involved in this case\u2014an interval that may have been as short as five seconds\u2014I believe the jury could reasonably have found that Washington\u2019s conduct in pointing and discharging the shotgun was the \u201cinitiation of a gun-battle\u201d which led to his co-felon\u2019s death. Under our cases, that malicious act is sufficient to sustain the murder convictions of both Washington and Caldwell. In light of this conclusion, there is no need to determine whether Caldwell\u2019s reckless driving was a proximate cause of the death or whether there is substantial evidence to support an implied finding that Caldwell possessed a handgun at the scene of the shooting. These factors may have added to the tension of the situation but they are not critical in the play of events.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-8\">In denying a motion for new trial, the trial court expressly relied on Washington\u2019s actions to support the jury\u2019s verdict, at the same time explaining why the jury may have found Washington in possession of a shotgun and yet acquitted him of assault on Officers Hunt and McSweeney: \u201c . . .

In so ruling, the majority distort the prior decisions of this court and seriously undermine the well-established principle that the felony-murder rule does not apply to killings committed by persons other than the felons themselves. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Washington </em>(1965) 62 Cal.2d <em>777, </em>783 [44 Cal.Rptr. 442, 402 P.2d 130].)</p>\n<p id=\"b256-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-8\">As the majority assertedly recognize, neither appellant Caldwell nor appellant Washington could be convicted of murder under the felony-murder rule, since the victim was killed not by either of them, but by a deputy sheriff. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Washington, supra, </em>62 Cal.2d at p. 783.) Nor could either appellant be convicted on the basis of the acts of Belvin, their deceased accomplice, because Belvin\u2019s malicious conduct \u201cdid not result in the unlawful killing of <em>another </em>human being, but rather in [his] own death.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Antick </em>(1975) 15 Cal.3d 79, 91 [123 Cal.Rptr. 475, 539 P.2d 43].)</p>\n<p id=\"b256-9\">It is agreed, then, that appellants could only be convicted of murder for their own actions under the rule of <em>People </em>v. <em>Gilbert </em>(1965) 63 Cal.2d 690, 704-705 [47 Cal.Rptr. 909, 408 P.2d 365], vacated on other grounds <em>sub nom., Gilbert </em>v. <em>California </em>(1967) 388 U.S. 263 [18 L.Ed.2d 1178, 87 S.Ct. 1951]. To establish liability under <em>Gilbert, </em>the prosecution must prove that the accused or a surviving accomplice \u201cintentionally commit[ted] an act that [was] likely to cause death, and [that] his victim or a police officer kill[ed] in reasonable response to such act ... .\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 704.)</p>\n<p id=\"b256-10\">This test contains two components corresponding to the two elements of the crime of murder, mens rea, or guilty state of mind, and actus reus, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>physical act of killing a human being. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Antick, supra, </em>15 Cal.3d at pp. 86-87.)</p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">Malice, the mens rea of murder, may be implied from the intentional commission of \u201c ' \u201can act that involves a high degree of probability that it will result in death . . . \u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Gilbert, supra, </em>63 Cal.2d at p. 704.) The \u201ccentral inquiry\u201d is whether \u201cthe conduct of a defendant or his accomplices was sufficiently provocative of lethal resistance to support a finding of implied malice.\u201d <em>(Taylor </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1970) 3 Cal.3d 578, 583 [91 Cal.Rptr. 275, 477 P.2d 131], italics omitted, disapproved on another point, <em>People </em>v. <em>Antick, supra, </em>15 Cal.3d at p. 92, fn. 12.)</p>\n<p id=\"b257-7\">A malicious act integral to the underlying felony is not enough for a finding of implied malice. The killing must be attributable \u201cnot merely to the commission of a felony, but to the intentional act of the defendant or his accomplice committed with conscious disregard for life.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Gilbert, supra, </em>63 Cal.2d at p. 704.) A threat \u201calready inherent in the dangerous felony\u201d is \u201cinsufficient for a finding of <em>Washington-Gilbert </em>murder even when it helped provoke the victim\u2019s lethal response.\u201d <em>(In re Joe R. </em>(1980) 27 Cal.3d 496, 508 [165 Cal.Rptr. 837, 612 P.2d 927].) It is this requirement of a malicious act over and above the underlying felony which most significantly differentiates liability under <em>Gilbert </em>from felony murder.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b257-8\">The physical act of killing or \u201cactus reus,\u201d though performed by a non-felon, may nevertheless be attributed to the accused provided his malicious act \u201cproximately caused\u201d the victim\u2019s death. <em>(Pizano </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1978) 21 Cal.3d 128, 131 [145 Cal.Rptr. 524, 577 P.2d 659]; <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>3 Cal.3d at p. 583.) To establish proximate cause, the prosecution must show that the malicious act of the accused or his surviving accomplice posed such a threat of harm as to provoke a reasonable lethal response. In such a case, the action of the third party \u201ccannot be considered an independent intervening cause for which the defendant is not liable, for it is a reasonable response <em>to the dilemma thrust upon the victim or the policeman by the intentional act of the defendant or his accomplice. </em>\u201d <em>(Gilbert, supra, </em>63 Cal.2d at p. 705, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b257-9\">Although a malicious act may be morally reprehensible in and of itself, it does not constitute <em>murder </em>unless the third party killed \u201cin reasonable response <em>to such act </em>. . . .\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Gilbert, supra, 63 </em>Cal.2d at p. 704, italics added; see also <em>In re Joe R., supra, </em>27 Cal.3d at p. 506, fn. 6.) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>Conversely, the commission of an act which contributes causally to the accused\u2019s death, but is not itself malicious, cannot support a murder conviction.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b258-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">Today\u2019s majority opinion upholds appellants\u2019 murder convictions under the <em>Gilbert </em>rule. The majority point to three acts in support of the convictions: (1) appellant Caldwell drove the getaway car without headlights and at high speed through stop signs and red lights, (2) appellant Washington pointed a shotgun at two deputies prior to the crash, and (3) appellant Caldwell emerged from the car and crouched behind the open door, holding\u2014 but not pointing\u2014a gun.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-6\">However, these acts could not have supported the findings of implied malice and proximate causation necessary to convict appellants of murder for the killing of their accomplice by the officers. Under the case law, the first two of these acts were indeed malicious, but could not conceivably have caused the victim\u2019s death. The third was neither malicious nor a proximate cause of the death.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-7\">It is true that Caldwell\u2019s driving and Washington\u2019s shotgun pointing were \u201csufficiently provocative of lethal resistance to support a finding of implied malice.\u201d <em>(Taylor </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>3 Cal.3d at p. 583, italics omitted.) However, no reasonable jury could find that either of those acts proximately caused Belvin\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-8\">At least five seconds before the deputies opened fire, the robbers\u2019 car was at rest, trapped between two police cars. Washington\u2019s shotgun was lying in the street out of reach. Both the car and the shotgun had \u201c[come] to rest in a position of apparent safety.\u201d (Perkins &amp; Boyce, Criminal Law (3d ed. 1982) p. 780; maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 219.)</p>\n<p id=\"b258-9\">These facts make it abundantly clear that the deputies did not fire \u201cin reasonable response\u201d to the threats posed by Caldwell\u2019s reckless driving or by Washington\u2019s shotgun pointing. <em>(Gilbert, supra, </em>63 Cal.2d at p. 704.) At the time of the shooting, neither act posed the kind of \u201cdilemma\u201d <em>(id., </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>at p. 705) that could negate the conduct of the deputies as an independent intervening cause of Belvin\u2019s death.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">Furthermore, as to the shotgun, the jury expressly found that Washington did not personally use a firearm in the commission of robbery or murder. (Pen. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 12022.5, 1203.06, subd. (a)(1).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>) Thus, it is apparent that the jury did not find that Washington\u2019s brandishing of the shotgun proximately caused Belvin\u2019s death.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b259-6\">Faced with the undeniable fact that any threat from the driving and shotgun pointing had completely dissipated by the time of the shooting, the majority acknowledge that the causal relationship does present a \u201cdifficult problem.\u201d (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 219.) The majority purport to solve this problem by relying on two highly questionable grounds to support the finding of proximate cause: (1) one deputy\u2019s testimony that the driving and shotgun pointing influenced his decision to fire, and (2) the jury\u2019s possible inference that in the absence of those two acts, Belvin may not have pointed his gun.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-7\">The first ground introduces into the law a creative and dangerous expansion of vicarious murder liability. No longer will it be required that a third party have fired in reasonable response to the accused\u2019s malicious act. Now, an accused may be convicted of murder for such an act even when the third party fires in reasonable response to the threat posed by some <em>other </em>danger. According to the majority, an accused may face potential murder liability <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>for his malicious act as long as the impact of that act lingers on in the fears of the third party.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b260-4\">The error of the majority\u2019s new rule is highlighted by the facts of this case. Only Deputy Boothroyd mentioned the driving or shotgun pointing as factors in his decision to fire. He testified that he fired because of his \u201cwhole frame of mind due to the circumstances leading up that point.\u201d Those circumstances included: \u201cthe pursuit [and] the evasiveness of the driver during the pursuit[.] [OJne gun [Washington\u2019s] had been seen and was no longer a problem at that time but, then, another handgun [Belvin\u2019s] comes out. There are still three people in the vehicle, and the possibility of having more guns in the car at that time went through my mind and the fact that the other two persons in the vehicle [appellants] were out of sight at that time.\u201d Boothroyd further testified that some 12 to 13 seconds after the shotgun had dropped to the street a shot\u2014the first he had heard\u2014triggered his firing.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">On this testimony, a jury could certainly have found that Deputy Boothroyd\u2019s decision to fire was reasonable. However, such a finding does not mean that appellants were guilty of murder. Deputy Boothroyd considered many factors that were extraneous to appellants\u2019 guilt, such as Belvin\u2019s pistol pointing and the fact that both appellants were out of his sight. No reasonable jury could have found that appellants\u2019 acts confronted Boothroyd with the life-threatening \u201cdilemma\u201d <em>(Gilbert, supra, </em>63 Cal.2d at p. 705) that eliminated his firing as an independent intervening cause. Rather, the record points inescapably to the conclusion that Belvin\u2019s own pistol pointing posed the only immediate threat visible to Boothroyd.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-6\">According to the majority\u2019s second theory of causation, the jury might have found that Belvin would not have been willing to provoke a gun battle had appellants not continued to resist. According to this view, the \u201cinferential importance\u201d of the shotgun waving to Belvin militates in favor of a finding of proximate cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-7\">This theory neatly overrules <em>People </em>v. <em>Antick, supra, </em>15 Cal.3d 79, on the issue of causation. <em>Antick </em>held that an accused cannot be held liable for the provocative acts of an accomplice who himself becomes the victim of the police response. <em>(Id., </em>at p. 91.) However, under today\u2019s majority opinion, an accused may be held responsible for the provocative acts of his deceased accomplice on the assumption that the deceased might have ceased his provocative conduct had the accused surrendered. (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 220.)</p>\n<p id=\"b261-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>This exception swallows the <em>Antick </em>rule. It is difficult to imagine a situation in which the actions of co-felons are not sufficiently interconnected to support a jury finding that one might not have acted but for the continued resistance of others.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-5\">In support of its relaxed approach to causation, the majority cite a number of cases involving multiple causation. (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at pp. 220-222.) These cases, however, support appellants\u2019 position. In each case, a third party killed in reasonable response to the immediate threat posed by a malicious act of the accused or his surviving accomplice. For example, the appellant in <em>In re Tyrone B. </em>(1976) 58 Cal.App.3d 884 [130 Cal.Rptr. 245], shoved and stabbed the robbery victim while the accomplice beat him with a shovel handle. In response, the robbery victim shot the accomplice. <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 886-887.) In <em>People </em>v. <em>Velasquez </em>(1975) 53 Cal.App.3d 547 [126 Cal.Rptr. 11], the accused and his brother both repeatedly struck an officer with batons and persisted in their attack despite a second officer\u2019s warnings to stop. The second officer then shot and killed the accused\u2019s brother. <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 551-552.) Finally, in <em>People </em>v. <em>Claflin </em>(1978) 87 Cal.App.3d 1, one of the appellants charged a police officer, struck him, and grabbed the barrel of his gun. <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 3-4.)</p>\n<p id=\"b261-6\">In marked contrast to the malicious acts in those cases, neither the driving nor the shotgun pointing in the present case posed an immediate threat at the time of the killing.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-7\">In addition to the driving and shotgun pointing, the majority rely on Caldwell\u2019s post-crash conduct to support these convictions. They assert that appellants may be convicted of murder for Caldwell\u2019s \u201cmalicious\u201d act of taking cover and assertedly holding, but not pointing, a gun. This theory fails for two reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-8\">First, the record does not support a finding that Caldwell was holding a gun when he stepped out of the car. There were eight officers on the scene, <em>but only one, </em>Deputy McSweeney, testified to having caught a brief glimpse of something \u201crecognizable\u201d as a gun when Caldwell left the car.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The alleged gun was never found. A search of the area and of the robbers\u2019 car turned up only Washington\u2019s shotgun and Belvin\u2019s handgun.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-9\">To survive appeal, a criminal conviction must be supported by \u201csubstantial evidence.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Johnson </em>(1980) 26 Cal.3d 557, 562 [162 Cal.Rptr. 431, 606 P.2d 738, 16 A.L.R.4th 1255].) The reviewing court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>must assess the record \u201cin the light most favorable to the judgment below.\u201d (Id., at p. 578.) However, \u201c[t]he court does not . . . limit its review to the evidence favorable to the respondent.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 577.) Instead, \u201cour task in this regard is twofold. First, we must resolve the issue in the light of the <em>whole record </em>. . . and may not limit our appraisal to isolated bits of evidence selected by the respondent. Second, we must judge whether the evidence of each of the essential elements constituting the higher degree of the crime is <em>substantial, </em>it is not enough for the respondent simply to point to \u2018some\u2019 evidence supporting the finding, for \u2018Not every surface conflict of evidence remains substantial in the light of other facts.\u2019\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Bassett </em>(1968) 69 Cal.2d 122, 137-138 [70 Cal.Rptr. 193, 443 P.2d 777], fn. omitted; see <em>People </em>v. <em>Johnson, supra, </em>26 Cal.3d at p. 577.)</p>\n<p id=\"b262-4\">To conclude that Caldwell had a gun, a jury would have had to find beyond a reasonable doubt: (1) that the object glimpsed by Deputy McSweeney but by no other officer was a gun, (2) that Caldwell managed to throw it away without being observed, and (3) that he hurled it far enough to evade the officers\u2019 subsequent search. But the robbers\u2019 car was under continuous observation from the moment Caldwell left it to the moment of surrender seconds later. Eight officers and four squad cars were grouped within a few yards of the robbers\u2019 car. No officer testified to having seen Caldwell dispose of the gun or make any rapid movement. The entire area around the scene of the shootout was searched by police officers, as was appellants\u2019 car. No trace of the alleged weapon was found. This is not <em>substantial </em>evidence\u2014i.e., \u201cevidence which, when viewed in light of the entire record, is of solid probative value, maintains its credibility and inspires confidence that the ultimate fact it addresses has been justly determined\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Conner </em>(1983) 34 Cal.3d 141, 149 [193 Cal.Rptr. 148, 666 P.2d 5])\u2014that Caldwell possessed a gun as he emerged from the car.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-5\">Second, even accepting arguendo the majority\u2019s conclusions as to the \u201csubstantial\u201d nature of the evidence, Caldwell\u2019s conduct after the crash cannot\u2014as a matter of law\u2014support these murder convictions. In <em>sum toto, </em>Caldwell left the car, crouched behind the open door, and looked at a deputy-all while carrying a handgun. He did not point the gun, issue a threat, move toward the deputies, or make any other affirmative gesture of an intent to inflict harm. At most, this conduct indicates that he had not yet decided to surrender.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> It adds nothing of significance to the original felony of armed robbery. Moreover, the jury found that Caldwell\u2019s conduct did not even amount to assault.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b263-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>Until today, California courts have uniformly required evidence of some affirmatively aggressive action by the accused or his surviving accomplice to support a finding of implied malice under <em>Gilbert. </em>In <em>Gilbert, </em>a surviving felon shot a policeman, initiating a gun battle.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Similarly, in <em>Pizano </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>21 Cal.3d 128, a robber pointed a pistol at the robbery victim, threatened to shoot him if the police intervened, and used him as a shield. <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 132-133.) In <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>3 Cal.3d 578, one of the robbers threatened a storeowner with death and \u201c\u2018chattered insanely.\u2019\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 581.)<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> And in <em>People </em>v. <em>Reed </em>(1969) 270 Cal.App.2d 37 [75 Cal.Rptr. 430], the accused pointed his gun toward one of the officers and toward the victim. (Id., at p. 42.)<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">Nevertheless, a majority of this court assert that Caldwell\u2019s departure from the car amounted to a malicious act. They reason that the jury could have found this act to have provoked a reasonable, lethal response. This reasoning ignores the requirement that, regardless of the reasonableness of the police response, the accused\u2019s conduct must be \u201csufficiently provocative of lethal resistance <em>to support a finding of implied malice.\u201d (Taylor </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>3 Cal.3d at p. 583, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b263-6\">The majority confuse the reasonableness of the deputies\u2019 response, which goes to the proximate cause issue,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> with the question of implied malice, which goes to appellant\u2019s state of mind. In so doing, they bypass Caldwell\u2019s state of mind, or mens rea, which is one of the basic elements of murder. In effect, this omission reestablishes the felony-murder rule for killings by third parties and directly contravenes this court\u2019s holding in <em>People </em>v. <em>Washington, supra, </em>62 Cal.2d at page 783.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>The reasonableness of the police response had no bearing on Caldwell\u2019s state of mind. It is one thing to say that a police response was reasonable. It is quite another to say that the defendant should be held liable for murder. As noted above, in deciding whether to fire, an officer must consider many factors that are extraneous to the accused\u2019s culpability. Here, for example, a deputy apparently concluded that Caldwell\u2019s failure to surrender or to drop his alleged gun, <em>combined with </em>Belvin\u2019s threatening gestures, required preemptive action. Even remaining in the car could have been interpreted by the police as indicating an intent to resist.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Such conclusions could arguably be considered reasonable, but they cannot substitute for a finding of intentional conduct by Caldwell which affirmatively establishes a malicious intent on his part.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-4\">To equate the reasonableness of the police response with the element of the accused\u2019s implied malice is to subvert the requirement that a jury convict an accused only if all the elements of murder are proven beyond a reasonable doubt. Instead of finding beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused or his surviving accomplice actually committed malicious acts, a jury now need only determine that a deputy reasonably believed that lethal force was appropriate to prevent possible harm or escape. Hence, an accused\u2019s culpability for murder would hinge not on his own actions or state of mind, but on an officer\u2019s subjective impression of the situation, including factors extraneous to the actions of the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">Not only was Caldwell\u2019s post-crash conduct insufficiently provocative to support a finding of implied malice, but it also could not conceivably have caused Belvin\u2019s death. Deputy McSweeney, the only officer who testified to having seen Caldwell with a gun, fired not at Belvin (the decedent), but at Caldwell.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-6\">Evidently sensing the weakness of this causal connection, the majority attempt to bolster their position by suggesting that the robbers might have acted \u201cin concert\u2019\u2019 to provoke the shooting. According to this theory, the jury might \u201creasonably have inferred that Belvin would have been unwilling to provoke a gun battle if Caldwell had not similarly adopted an aggressive stance, refusing to drop his gun.\u2019\u2019 (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 220.) However, as explained above, the majority\u2019s attempt to run the causal link through the deceased accomplice\u2019s subjective state of mind effectively overrules the sound holding of <em>People </em>v. <em>Antick, supra, </em>15 Cal.3d 79. (See <em>ante, </em>at pp. 217-219.)</p>\n<p id=\"b265-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>III.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">In <em>People </em>v. <em>Washington, supra, </em>62 Cal.2d at page 783, this court held that the felony-murder rule does not apply to killings not physically committed by the felons themselves. Today\u2019s majority opinion takes a big step toward overturning that sound holding.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">What differentiates <em>Gilbert </em>murder from traditional felony murder is the requirement of a malicious act by one of the surviving accomplices. (See LaVaute, <em>Criminal Liability of a Participant in Crime for the Death of a Fellow Participant </em>(1971) 22 Syracuse L.Rev. 1065, 1074-1077.) However, under the majority\u2019s approach, malice may be so easily implied that the distinction is now more apparent than real. Malice may be implied from acts that no longer posed a threat at the time of the killing. It may be implied from the mere holding\u2014but not pointing\u2014of a gun. It may be implied from acts that did not themselves provoke a lethal response, but that influenced the deceased felon to provoke his own death.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-7\">I respectfully dissent from this unsupported expansion of vicarious murder liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-8\">Appellant\u2019s petitions for a rehearing were denied August 31, 1984. Bird, C. J., was of the opinion that the petitions should be granted.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b257-10\">The felony-murder rule relieves the prosecution of proving the element of malice for a killing committed in the course of a felony by one of the perpetrators. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Dillon </em>(1983) 34 Cal.3d 441, 473-476 [194 Cal.Rptr. 390, 668 P.2d 697].)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b258-10\">See <em>In re Joe </em>R., <em>supra, </em>27 Cal.3d 496.

This court held that the accused\u2019s act of assistance could not support a murder conviction because there was no indication that the purpose of moving the robbery victim was anything more than facilitating the safe completion of the robbery. <em>(Id., </em>at p. 508.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b259-8\">It is noteworthy that this case does not present the situation where a person sets off a chain of provoked responses. In that case, a person might be convicted of murder even though his gun lay in the street at the moment of the actual killing. In the present case, however, the lull between appellants\u2019 malicious acts and the gun battle was sufficient to break any chain that might have commenced. Moreover, Deputy Boothroyd\u2014the only deputy to testify that the driving or shotgun pointing figured in his decision to fire\u2014stated that the lull lasted at least 12 seconds, and that the shotgun was \u201cno longer a problem\u201d at the time of the shooting.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b259-9\">Hereafter, all statutory references are to the Penal Code.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b259-10\">The majority attempt to explain away this problem by suggesting that the jury \u201cmay have decided that Washington was prevented from \u2018using\u2019 the shotgun when the patrol car rammed the suspects\u2019 vehicle and it flew out of his hands.\u201d (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 220, fn. 3.) Having thus made Washington\u2019s argument for him, the majority proceed to misconstrue the term \u201cuse\u201d in a manner totally unfounded in law or logic: \u201cIt is true that a criminal can \u2018use\u2019 a gun merely by displaying it, but that was evidently not what Washington had in mind; merely displaying it would have served no purpose\u2014i.e., would have been \u2018use\u2019less\u2014in the circumstances.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>Where this construction of personal use came from or what relevance it has to the proximate cause issue is left unexplained. In any case, the jury was clearly instructed that the term \u201cused a firearm\u201d means <em>\u201cto display a firearm in a menacing manner, </em>intentionally to fire <em>it, or </em>intentionally to strike or hit a human being with it.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b260-9\">The majority find a significant causal connection in the fact that one deputy counted Washington\u2019s shotgun pointing \u201camong his reasons for fearing for his and his compatriots\u2019 safety.\u201d (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at pp. 219-220.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b261-10\">AIso, in his written report of the shootout, Deputy McSweeney stated that Caldwell exited the car holding what \u201cappeared to be a gun.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b262-6\">By all accounts, appellant maintained this indecisive posture for less than a minute.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b262-7\">The jury found Caldwell not guilty of assault with a deadly weapon on a peace officer (\u00a7 245, subd.
