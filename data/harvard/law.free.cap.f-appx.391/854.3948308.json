After review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-13\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b879-14\">A. State Court Action</p>\n<p id=\"b879-15\">On September 16, 2005, Jackson, <em>pro se, </em>filed a complaint in Alabama state court against her insurance company, Farmers Insurance Group/Fire Insurance Exchange (\u201cFarmers\u201d), which had issued her a homeowners insurance policy. Jackson\u2019s complaint alleged that Farmers refused to pay her claims for damage to her home caused by Hurricanes Ivan and Katrina, as required by her homeowners policy. The Alabama trial court granted summary judgment to Farmers, and Jackson appealed. The Alabama Court of Civil Appeals affirmed. <em>Jackson v. Farmers Ins. Grp./Fire Ins. Exch., </em>26 So.3d 1276 (Ala.Civ.App.2008). Jackson filed a petition for a writ of certiorari in the Alabama Supreme Court, which was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-16\">B. Federal Court Action</p>\n<p id=\"b879-17\">In 2009, Jackson, <em>pro se, </em>filed a complaint in federal district court against Farmers, alleging, <em>inter alia, </em>violations of the \u201cAlabama Insurance Code\u201d; civil conspiracy to violate the \u201cAlabama Deceptive Trade Practices-Consumer Protection Act\u201d; Ala.Code \u00a7 8-19-1 <em>et seq.; </em>breach of contract; bad faith; negligent misrepresentation; and fraud based upon Farmer\u2019s alleged failure to pay benefits in full for damages Jackson sustained in Hurricanes Ivan and Katrina, as required by her homeowners insurance policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-18\">Jackson filed a motion to proceed <em>in forma pauperis, </em>and the district court ordered Jackson to submit additional information regarding Jackson\u2019s action against Farmers in Alabama state corut. After Jackson submitted various records from the proceedings in Alabama state court, the district court granted Jackson\u2019s request to proceed <em>in forma pauperis </em>but dismissed Jackson\u2019s suit as frivolous pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(i). The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"856\">*856</page-number>district court concluded that the relief Jackson sought in federal district court was the subject of her state court lawsuit and therefore the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over Jackson\u2019s complaint under the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b880-4\">Jackson appealed and filed a motion for appointment of counsel, which this Court denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-5\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"AEZ\">A. <em>Sua Sponte </em>Dismissals</p>\n<p id=\"b880-6\">The district court must dismiss an <em>in forma pauperis </em>complaint at any time if it determines that the action \u201cis frivolous or malicious.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(i). A complaint \u201cis frivolous where it lacks an arguable basis either in law or in fact.\u201d <em>Neitzke v. Williams, </em>490 U.S. 319, 325, 109 S.Ct. 1827, 1831-32, 104 L.Ed.2d 338 (1989). We also have stated that a case is frivolous if the factual allegations are \u201cclearly baseless,\u201d or if it is based on an \u201cindisputably meritless\u201d legal theory. <em>Carroll v. Gross, </em>984 F.2d 392, 393 (11th Cir.1993) (quotation marks omitted). In addition, a district court may <em>sua sponte </em>consider subject matter jurisdiction at any stage in the litigation and must dismiss a complaint if it concludes that subject matter jurisdiction is lacking. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(h)(3); <em>Arbaugh v. Y &amp; H Corp., </em>546 U.S. 500, 506, 514, 126 S.Ct. 1235, 1240, 163 L.Ed.2d 1097 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b880-7\"><em>\u201cPro se </em>pleadings are held to a less stringent standard than pleadings drafted by attorneys and will, therefore, be liberally construed.\u201d <em>Tannenbaum v. United States, </em>148 F.3d 1262, 1263 (11th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b880-11\">B. <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>Doctrine</p>\n<p id=\"b880-12\">Under the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine, lower federal courts \u201cdo not have jurisdiction to act as appellate courts and [are] preclude[d] ... from reviewing final state court decisions.\u201d <em>Green v. Jefferson County Comm\u2019n, </em>563 F.3d 1243, 1249 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 199, 175 L.Ed.2d 127 (2009). The <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine is confined to cases that are \u201c[1] brought by state-court losers [2] complaining of injuries caused by state-court judgments [3] rendered before the district court proceedings commenced and [4] inviting district court review and rejection of those judgments.\u201d <em>Exxon Mobil Corp. v. Saudi Basic Indus. Corp., </em>544 U.S. 280, 284, 125 S.Ct. 1517, 1521-22, 161 L.Ed.2d 454 (2005); <em>see also Nicholson v. Shafe, </em>558 F.3d 1266, 1272-74, 1278-79 (11th Cir.2009) (explaining that, after <em>Exxon Mobil, </em>the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine is limited and applied narrowly). \u201cThe doctrine applies both to federal claims raised in the state court and to those \u2018inextricably intertwined\u2019 with the state court\u2019s judgment.\u201d <em>Casale v. Tillman, </em>558 F.3d 1258, 1260 (11th Cir.2009). \u201cA claim is inextricably intertwined if it would effectively nullify the state court judgment, or it succeeds only to the extent that the state court wrongly decided the issues.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Furthermore, the <em>Rooker-Feld-man </em>doctrine applies only when the state court proceedings ended before the federal action was filed. <em>Nicholson, </em>558 F.3d at 1275, 1277 n. 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-15\">After liberally construing Jackson\u2019s <em>pro se </em>complaint, we find no reversible error in the district court\u2019s <em>sua sponte </em>dismissal with prejudice.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On appeal, Jackson\u2019s ar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"857\">*857</page-number>guments are far from clear. Jackson appears to make several arguments as to why the Alabama trial court\u2019s decision was illegal, why she should have been granted a default judgment, how Farmers deceived the Alabama trial court judge, and how the Alabama judicial system discriminated against her on the basis of her race. Jackson specifically requests a trial by jury against Farmers as well as an order from this Court granting her relief under Alabama Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b), which provides the circumstances under which an Alabama court may reheve a party from a final judgment, order, or proceeding. Aa. R. Civ. P. 60(b). Jackson makes no argument on appeal regarding the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine, which underlies the district court\u2019s dismissal of her complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-5\">After review, we conclude the district court correctly determined that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction. Jackson is a state court loser complaining of injuries caused by a state court judgment. In her federal complaint, Jackson claims that she should have received a judgment in her favor in the state court proceedings but was unlawfully deprived of a favorable result due to the actions of Farmers and various other state government actors. She also reargues the merits of the claims she brought in the Alabama trial court. Jackson is clearly seeking federal court review and rejection of the judgment of the Alabama courts. Therefore, Jackson\u2019s claims are \u201cinextricably intertwined\u201d with the state court judgment, and granting Jackson\u2019s claims would \u201ceffectively nullify\u201d the state court judgment. <em>See Exxon Mobil Corp., </em>544 U.S. at 283-84, 125 S.Ct. at 1521 (noting that the federal complaints in the <em>Rooker </em>and <em>Feldman </em>cases \u201cinvited federal courts of first instance to review and reverse unfavorable state-court judgments.\u201d); <em>Casale, </em>558 F.3d at 1260-61.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-11\">Moreover, because the Supreme Court of Alabama denied her writ of certiorari prior to her filing suit in federal district court, it is clear that the state court proceedings ended prior to the filing of her federal court proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-12\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b881-13\">Jackson\u2019s motion to reconsider the denial of her motion for appointment of counsel is DENIED. For the reasons given above, we affirm the district court\u2019s order dismissing Jackson\u2019s complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-14\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b880-8\">. <em>See Rooker v.
