Jimenez contends his sentence is substantively unreasonable, because the court should have imposed a probation-only sentence based on his exceptional military service, and based on his family ties and responsibilities.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> After review, we affirm Jimenez\u2019s sentence.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b842-18\">We consider the substantive reasonableness of the sentence imposed by inquiring whether the sentence is supported by the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). The weight accorded to the \u00a7 3553(a) factors is within the district court\u2019s discretion. <em>United States v. Clay, </em>483 F.3d 739, 743 (11th Cir.2007). Moreover, when considering whether a defendant\u2019s sentence is reasonable, we have compared the sentence actually imposed to the statutory maximum. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Valnor, </em>451 F.3d 744, 751-52 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b842-19\">Jimenez has failed to show the court\u2019s sentence was substantively unreasonable in light of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. Jimenez harbored illegal aliens by providing transportation and lodging to them. The purpose of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1324 is to \u201cpenalize employers for hiring illegal aliens,\u201d as this results in a lost employment opportunity for an American citizen, and for \u201charboring them from detection by providing transportation and housing for them.\u201d <em>United States v. Zheng, </em>306 F.3d 1080, 1087 (11th Cir.2002). His Guideline-range sentence sufficiently covered his offense conduct. The record indicates the district court adequately considered Jimenez\u2019s mil<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"819\">*819</page-number>itary background and family situation. His total sentence of 21 months was less than the statutory maximum of 36 months for violating 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7206(1) and considerably less than the 120-month statutory maximum for violating 8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1324(a)(l)(A)(iii), (a)(l)(A)(v)(II), and (a)(1)(B)\u00ae. Therefore, Jimenez has failed to demonstrate his sentence is unreasonable. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b842-15\">. Jimenez also asserts the district court erred by denying his request for a downward departure based on similar grounds listed above. We lack jurisdiction to review this claim because the record shows the court knew it had the authority to grant his request for a downward departure. <em>United States v. Winingear, </em>422 F.3d 1241, 1245 (11th Cir.2005) (holding, <em>post-Booker, </em>this Court still lacks jurisdiction to review the decision of the district court not to apply a downward departure).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b842-21\">. We review the sentence imposed by the district court for reasonableness, and the party challenging that sentence bears the burden of establishing that the sentence is unreasonable. <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 785, 788 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
