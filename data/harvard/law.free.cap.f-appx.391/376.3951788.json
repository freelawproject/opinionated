He asserts that his sentence, despite being within the applicable guidelines range, was substantively unreasonable because it was greater than needed to accomplish the goals of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3558(a). He notes that the defense arguments at sentencing focused on his cultural assimilation and his improved character and prospects in Mexico.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">Because Arredondo did not object to the imposed sentence as unreasonable, we review this claim for plain error. <em>United States v. Peltier, </em>505 F.3d 389, 391-92 (5th Cir.2007). Arredondo\u2019s disagreement with the within-guidelines sentence imposed does not suffice to rebut the presumption of reasonableness. <em>See Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007); <em>United States v. Campos-Maldonado, </em>531 F.3d 337, 338 (5th Cir.2008); <em>United States v. Gomez-Herrera, </em>523 F.3d 554, 565-66 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b401-6\">Additionally, Arredondo contends that the applicable guidelines range of 77-96 months in prison was too severe because U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2 was not empirically based. This court has consistently rejected Arredondo\u2019s \u201cempirical data\u201d argument. <em>See United States v. Duarte, </em>569 F.3d 528, 529-30 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 378, 175 L.Ed.2d 231 (2009). Additionally Arredondo has not established that this court may not apply a presumption of reasonableness to a sentence imposed within the applicable guidelines range. <em>See United States v. Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d 357, 367 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 192, 175 L.Ed.2d 120 (2009). Consequently, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b400-7\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
