We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s legal conclusions about the scope of its authority in a section 3582(c)(2) proceeding. <em>United States v. James, </em>548 F.3d 983, 984 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b805-15\">A district court may modify a term of imprisonment in the case of a defendant who was sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that later has been lowered by the Sentencing Commission. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). But a defendant who initially was sentenced to the statutory minimum is ineligible for a reduction under Amendment 706 and section 3582(c)(2). <em>United States v. Williams, </em>549 F.3d 1337, 1342 (11th Cir.2008); <em>see also </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, cmt. n. 1(A) (noting that \u201cthe operation of another guideline or statutory provision,\u201d such as \u201ca statutory mandatory minimum term of imprisonment,\u201d would prevent Amendment 706 from \u201chav[ing] the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range\u201d). Here, the district court committed no error in denying Brown a sentence reduction because her mandatory minimum life sentence caused Amendment 706 not to have the effect of lowering her guidelines range.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b805-16\">Brown\u2019s appellate arguments are unavailing. She argues that her mandatory life sentence violates <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), because the jury did not determine a specific drug quantity. But <em>Apprendi </em>involves no retroactively applicable guideline amendment and provides no independent jurisdictional basis to reduce Brown\u2019s sentence. <em>See United States v. Moreno, </em>421 F.3d 1217, 1220 (11th Cir.2005) (explaining that section 3582(c)(2) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"782\">*782</page-number>does not provide a basis for a <em>de novo </em>resentencing). And her argument that the guidelines should be advisory in a section 3582(c)(2) proceeding based on <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), and <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 85, 128 S.Ct. 558, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007), squarely is foreclosed by our precedent. <em>See United States v. Melvin, </em>556 F.3d 1190, 1192-93 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 2382, 173 L.Ed.2d 1300 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b806-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b805-12\">. Amendment 706 retroactively reduced by two the base offense levels in crack cocaine sentences calculated pursuant to the drug quantity table, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c).

In addition, Brown was precluded from a sentence reduction because she was responsible for 75 kilograms of cocaine. If a defendant is responsible for at least 4.5 kilograms of crack cocaine, Amendment 706 does not reduce her applicable guidelines range, and she is ineligible for a sentence reduction under section 3582(c)(2). <em>United States v. Jones, </em>548 F.3d 1366, 1369 (11th Cir.2008), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. \u2014, 129 S.Ct. 1657, 173 L.Ed.2d 1025 (2009).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
