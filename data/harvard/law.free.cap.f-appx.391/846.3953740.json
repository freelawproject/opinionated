Everett appeals the district court\u2019s decision denying his request for a transcript at the government\u2019s expense, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 753(f). A party in a civil proceeding may obtain a transcript at the government\u2019s expense if (1) he is granted leave to proceed <em>informa pauper-is </em>on appeal and (2) \u201cthe trial judge or a circuit judge certifies that the appeal is not frivolous (but presents a substantial question).\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 753(f). Everett has been granted leave to appeal <em>in forma pauperis </em>by the district court. Therefore, the only question is whether Everett\u2019s appeal is not frivolous, but presents a substantial question.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"847\">*847</page-number>At bottom, Everett\u2019s principal claim on appeal is that the district court\u2019s factual findings are contrary to the weight of the evidence.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Such a claim can neither be prosecuted nor reviewed in the absence of a transcript of the district court proceedings. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 10(b)(2). This kind of claim poses a dilemma: we arguably need to review the transcript to decide whether Everett is entitled to one. To avoid this circularity, we must first ask whether the representations made by Everett about what the record would reveal\u2014 if true \u2014 raise a substantial question. <em>See Jaffe v. United States, </em>246 F.2d 760, 762 (2d Cir.1957).</p>\n<p id=\"b871-5\">As we noted in our decision affirming the district court\u2019s denial of qualified immunity, \u201cthe facts of this case are hotly disputed.\u201d <em>Everett v. Smith, </em>No. 09-10343, at 3 (11th Cir. July 21, 2009). In support of his appeal, Everett points to his own contrary testimony, which the district court rejected, and to purported conflicts between the defendants\u2019 trial and deposition testimony. Everett\u2019s representations are sufficient to raise a debatable issue, even if minimally so. We cannot evaluate the weight of the evidence or the alleged discrepancies in the defendants\u2019 testimony without a transcript. Accordingly, the district court\u2019s decision denying Everett\u2019s request for a trial transcript pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 753(f) is reversed.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b871-6\">AFFIRMED in part and REVERSED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b871-8\">. Like the district court, we flatly reject Everett\u2019s assertion that the district court was biased against him based on his appearance at trial in a prison jumpsuit. Any appeal based on that alleged bias is frivolous.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b871-24\">. We affirm the denial of Everett\u2019s request for a transcript of the post-trial hearing on Everett\u2019s motion for sanctions.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
