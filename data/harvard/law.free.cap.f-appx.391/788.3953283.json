On appeal, Hughes argues that his sentence is substantively unreasonable due to the extent of the district court\u2019s upward variance from his guideline range of 24 to 30 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-14\">We review the sentence imposed by the district court for reasonableness. <em>United States v. Williams, </em>526 F.3d 1312, 1321 (11th Cir.2008). The Supreme Court has clarified that the reasonableness standard means review for abuse of discretion. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). \u201c[T]he burden of establishing that the sentence is unreasonable in light of the record and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors lies with the party challenging the sentence.\u201d <em>Williams, </em>526 F.3d at 1322.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-16\">First, Hughes does not challenge the procedural reasonableness of his total sentence and has waived any claim in this respect. Second, his sentence is substantively reasonable because (a) the district court explained its reasons for imposing an upward variance, and (b) Hughes\u2019s history and characteristics \u2014 including his 19 prior fraud convictions or 26 total convictions\u2014 justified the extent of this variance. Accordingly, we affirm his 84-month total sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-17\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
