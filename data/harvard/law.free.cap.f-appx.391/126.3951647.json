In his petition, Crooker alleged that, during a 35-day confinement in the Special Housing Unit, he was denied: the use of a comb; dental floss and dental picks; access to a typewriter; permission to purchase more than the regular limit of postage stamps; and permission to possess one cubic foot of legal flies. Crooker sought unspecified declaratory and injunctive relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-11\">The District Court denied the petition, reasoning that Crooker was a litigant subject to the \u201cthree-strike\u201d rule of \u00a7 1915(g), and that he styled his complaint as a \u00a7 2241 petition so that he could avoid the filing fee applicable to suits under <em>Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of Fed. Bureau of Narcotics, </em>403 U.S. 388, 91 S.Ct. 1999, 29 L.Ed.2d 619 (1971).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b151-14\">We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. Because Crooker is proceeding <em>in forma pauperis, </em>we must dismiss the appeal if it \u201clacks an arguable basis either in law or in fact.\u201d <em>Neitzke v. Williams, </em>490 U.S. 319, 325, 109 S.Ct. 1827, 104 L.Ed.2d 338 (1989); <em>see also </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2). We exercise plenary review over the District Court\u2019s legal determinations and apply a clearly erroneous standard to its factual findings. <em>See Cradle v. United States ex rel. Miner, </em>290 F.3d 536, 538 (3d Cir.2002) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b151-15\">Crooker\u2019s petition does not challenge the fact or duration of his imprisonment, which are the essence of habeas. <em>See Preiser v. Rodriguez, </em>411 U.S. 475, 484, 487, 93 S.Ct. 1827, 36 L.Ed.2d 439 (1973). As we have explained, \u201cwhen the challenge is to a condition of confinement such that a finding in plaintiffs favor would not alter his sentence or undo his conviction, an action under \u00a7 1983 is appropriate.\u201d <em>Leamer v. Fauver, </em>288 F.3d 532, 542 (3d Cir.2002). Nor did he challenge the manner in which his sentence was executed. Cf. <em>Woodall v. Fed. Bureau of Prisons, </em>432 F.3d 235, 243 (3d Cir.2005) (indicating that while certain types of transfers may give rise to habeas claims, \u201ca garden variety prison transfer\u201d would not). Where the defendants are federal actors, the plaintiff should seek relief under <em>Bivens. See Williams v. Hill, </em>74 F.3d 1339, 1339-41 (D.C.Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b151-16\">Accordingly, we will dismiss the appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2).</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b151-12\">. <em>Bivens </em>creates a cause of action which is the federal equivalent of the 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 action against state actors, and lies where the defendant has violated the plaintiff\u2019s rights under color of federal law. <em>See Brown v. Philip Morris Inc., </em>250 F.3d 789, 800 (3d Cir.2001).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
