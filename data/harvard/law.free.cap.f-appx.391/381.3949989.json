Although the district court reduced Nation\u2019s sentence from 235 months to 188 months, at the bottom of the newly applicable guidelines range, Nation argues that, pursuant to <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), the district court had the discretion to depart from the amended guidelines range. He further argues that 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 994(u) does not grant the Sentencing Commission authority to bind the district court\u2019s discretion in \u00a7 3582(c)(2) cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-9\">We review a district court\u2019s decision whether to reduce a sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) for an abuse of discretion, and its interpretation of the Sentencing Guidelines is reviewed de novo. <em>United States v. Doublin, </em>572 F.3d 235, 237 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 517, 175 L.Ed.2d 366 (2009). <em>Booker </em>is inapplicable to sentence reductions under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), and a district court may not reduce a sentence below the minimum provided in the amended guidelines range. <em>Id. </em>at 238. Consequently, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b406-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
