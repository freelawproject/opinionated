Meidinger brought a <em>pro se qui tarn </em>complaint on behalf of the United States against Lee Memorial under the False Claims Act, 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3729 <em>et seq. </em>On appeal, Lee Memorial argues that the district court improperly denied its motions for sanctions under Rule 11 because: (1) it failed to rule on the first motion for sanctions before entering judgment; (2) it failed to reinstate Lee Memorial\u2019s first motion for sanctions after reopening the case; (3) it failed to make findings of fact or conclusions of law sufficient to enable meaningful appellate review; and (4) its finding that Meidinger\u2019s action was not barred by <em>res judicata </em>was based on an erroneous view of the law or facts. Lee Memorial also argues that the district court abused its discretion in failing to award sanctions pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1927 or pursuant to the court\u2019s inherent authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-9\">\n<em>Rule 11</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b802-10\">We review a district court\u2019s order denying a motion for sanctions under Rule 11 for an abuse of discretion. <em>See Worldwide Primates, Inc. v. McGreal, </em>26 F.3d 1089, 1091 (11th Cir.1994). \u201cA district court would necessarily abuse its discretion if it based its ruling on an erroneous view of the law or on a clearly erroneous assessment of the evidence.\u201d <em>Jones v. Int\u2019l Riding Helmets, Ltd., </em>49 F.3d 692, 694 (11th Cir.1995) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b802-11\">Rule 11 provides in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b802-12\">By presenting to the court a pleading, written motion, or other paper \u2014 whether by signing, filing, submitting, or later advocating it \u2014 an attorney or unrepresented party certifies that to the best of the person\u2019s knowledge, information, and belief, formed after an inquiry reasonable under the circumstances:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b802-13\">(1) it is not being presented for any improper purpose, such as to harass, cause unnecessary delay, or needlessly increase the cost of litigation;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b802-14\">(2) the claims, defenses, and other legal contentions are warranted by existing law or by a nonfrivolous argument for extending, modifying, or reversing existing law or for establishing new law; [and]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b802-15\">(3) the factual contentions have eviden-tiary support or, if specifically so identified, will likely have evidentiary support after a reasonable opportunity for further investigation or discovery....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b802-16\">Fed.R.Civ.P. 11(b). \u201cRule 11 applies to pro se plaintiffs, but the court must take into account the plaintiffs pro se status when determining whether the filing was reasonable.\u201d <em>Thomas v. Evans, </em>880 F.2d 1235, 1240 (11th Cir.1989). No error by the district court is grounds for disturbing a judgment or order if the error does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"779\">*779</page-number>affect a party\u2019s substantial rights. Fed. R.Civ.P. 61.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-5\">To the extent that Lee Memorial argues that the district court erred in failing to rule on its first motion for Rule 11 sanctions before entering the judgment dismissing Meidinger\u2019s case, its argument is meritless. A court can rule on a motion for Rule 11 sanctions after the principal suit has been terminated. <em>Willy v. Coastal Corp., </em>503 U.S. 131, 132, 138, 112 S.Ct. 1076, 1077-78, 1080-81, 117 L.Ed.2d 280 (1992). And, Lee Memorial cannot show that its substantial rights were affected by the failure of the district court to rule on the first motion for sanctions before dismissal or by the court\u2019s decision not to reinstate the first motion for sanctions upon reinstatement of the lawsuit. Lee Memorial filed a subsequent motion for sanctions on the same grounds, and the court ruled on that motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-6\">The parties agree that the district court found that sanctions were not warranted because Meidinger\u2019s action was not barred by <em>res judicata. </em>\u201cA plaintiff may be sanctioned under Rule 11 for filing claims barred by res judicata.\u201d <em>Thomas, </em>880 F.2d at 1240. Whether <em>res judicata </em>bars a plaintiff\u2019s claim is a question of law we review <em>de novo. See Ragsdale v. Rubbermaid, Inc., </em>193 F.3d 1235, 1238 (11th Cir.1999). In determining whether sanctions are appropriate based on the doctrine of <em>res judicata, </em>the district court first must determine that the elements of <em>res judica-ta </em>are present. <em>Thomas, </em>880 F.2d at 1240.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-7\">We hold that the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Lee Memorial\u2019s motion for sanctions under Rule 11. The court stated, \u201cThe instant case involves claims made from January 1, 1999 through 2006. The only prior case in which a final judgment on the merits was issued ... did not involve claims between these dates.\u201d (R.5-161 at 4.) While brief, this statement by the district court is sufficient for this court to review the district court\u2019s rejection of the <em>res judicata </em>argument. Lee Memorial does not demonstrate that the district court\u2019s determination that this action raised challenges to transactions distinct from those involved in the prior suit was based on an erroneous view of the law or a clearly erroneous assessment of the evidence. And, while the district court\u2019s opinion did not articulate reasons for rejecting Lee Memorial\u2019s other arguments that Meidinger\u2019s claims were frivolous, we conclude that the record does not compel an award of sanctions pursuant to Rule 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-9\">\n<em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1927</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b803-10\">We review a district court\u2019s decision regarding sanctions under \u00a7 1927 for an abuse of discretion. <em>See Nicholson v. Shafe, </em>558 F.3d 1266, 1270 (11th Cir.2009). The United States Code provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b803-11\">Any attorney or other person admitted to conduct cases in any court of the United States ... who so multiplies the proceedings in any ease unreasonably and vexatiously may be required by the court to satisfy personally the excess costs, expenses, and attorneys\u2019 fees reasonably incurred because of such conduct.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b803-12\">28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1927. We have held that the plain language of the statute imposes three essential requirements: (1) the attorney must engage in unreasonable and vexatious conduct; (2) that conduct must multiply the proceedings; and (3) the amount of the sanction must bear a \u201cfinancial nexus to the excess proceedings.\u201d <em>Peterson v. BMI Refractories, </em>124 F.3d 1386, 1396 (11th Cir.1997). We also have stated that \u00a7 1927 must be \u201cstrictly construed\u201d because it is \u201cpenal in nature.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1395.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-13\">This court has not addressed the question of whether sanctions under \u00a7 1927 could apply to a <em>pro se </em>litigant like Meid-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"780\">*780</page-number>inger. For the purposes of this appeal, we assume without deciding that the statute could apply to <em>pro se </em>litigants.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-4\">Even so, we hold that the district court\u2019s decision not to impose sanctions on Meid-inger under \u00a7 1927 was not an abuse of discretion. Lee Memorial sought sanctions pursuant to the statute on the sole basis that, as an unrepresented <em>qui tam </em>relator, Meidinger filed motions in a <em>pro se </em>capacity, though <em>pro se </em>status is not allowed <em>qui tam </em>relators. (R.5-138.) In response to Lee Memorial\u2019s motion requesting \u00a7 1927 sanctions, the district court struck Meidinger\u2019s <em>pro se </em>filings, enjoined Meidinger from making additional <em>pro se </em>filings, granted Meidinger time to retain counsel, and denied Lee Memorial monetary sanctions. (R.5-157.) We find no abuse of discretion in these decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"Ad-\">\n<em>Inherent Authority</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b804-5\">We review a district court\u2019s ruling on a request for sanctions under its inherent authority for an abuse of discretion. <em>See Amlong &amp; Amlong, P.A. v. Denny\u2019s, Inc., </em>500 F.3d 1230, 1237-38 (11th Cir.2007). \u201cCourts have the inherent authority to control the proceedings before them, which includes the authority to impose reasonable and appropriate sanctions.\u201d <em>Martin v. Automobili Lamborghini Exclusive, Inc., </em>307 F.3d 1332, 1335 (11th Cir.2002) (quotation omitted). In order to exercise its inherent power to award sanctions, the court must find that a party acted in bad faith. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b804-6\">The district court did not abuse its discretion in declining to sanction Meidinger pursuant to its inherent authority. The record does not compel a finding that Meidinger acted in bad faith.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
