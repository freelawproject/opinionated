However, because Osagiede has not exhausted this issue by raising it before the BIA, this court\u2019s consideration of the issue is jurisdictionally barred. <em>See Wang v. Ashcroft, </em>260 F.3d 448, 452-53 (5th Cir.2001). Osagiede also has abandoned his argument before the BIA that his appeal should be held in abeyance until his appeal of his visa petition is resolved. <em>See Soadjede v. Ashcroft, </em>324 F.3d 830, 833 (5th Cir.2003); <em>Beasley v. McCotter, </em>798 F.2d 116, 118 (5th Cir.1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b412-4\">Additionally, Osagiede argues that the BIA erred in affirming the IJ\u2019s denial of withholding of removal and that he was entitled to withholding because he was subjected to government persecution based on his political views. However, Osagiede has not shown that any past persecution was on account of his political views or that there was a clear probability that he would be persecuted on account of his political views upon his return to Nigeria. <em>See Roy v. Ashcroft, </em>389 F.3d 132, 138 (5th Cir.2004). Accordingly, the evidence does not compel a conclusion contrary to that of the BIA and IJ. <em>See Zhu v. Gonzales, </em>493 F.3d 588, 594 (5th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b412-6\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b411-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
