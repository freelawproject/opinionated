We granted a certificate of appealability (\u201cCOA\u201d) on two issues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b828-16\">(1) Whether the district court violated <em>Clisby v. Jones, </em>960 F.2d 925, 936 (11th Cir.1992) <em>(en banc), </em>by failing to address McMillan\u2019s claim that his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to challenge the validity of the indictment; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b828-17\">(2) Whether the district court violated <em>Clisby </em>by failing to address McMillan\u2019s claim that his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to object to hearsay testimony by the victim\u2019s cousin, \u201cVickie.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b828-19\">In his opening brief on appeal, McMillan does not address these <em>Clisby </em>issues. We therefore deem them abandoned. <em>See Atkins v. Singletary, </em>965 F.2d 952, 955 n. 1 (11th Cir.1992). As for the issues he has briefed, we do not consider them, for the scope of our review is limited to the issues specified in the COA, <em>Murray v. United States, </em>145 F.3d 1249, 1250-51 (11th Cir.1998). The district court\u2019s judgment is, accordingly,</p>\n<p id=\"b828-20\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
