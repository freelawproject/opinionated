R.Crim.P. 35(a) and (36). Guerra argues that the court erred in denying her motion because her 70-month sentence, imposed on remand, is vindictive. She further argues that her sentence violates the Eighth Amendment\u2019s prohibition on cruel and un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"813\">*813</page-number>usual punishment because it is disproportionate to the nature of her underlying crimes of health care fraud and money laundering. She also indicates that her sentence violated the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), but does not explain why or how this violation occurred. In her reply brief, Guerra argues that the district court had jurisdiction to reduce her sentence because we previously had \u201creversed\u201d her sentence by holding that the district court erred in calculating her guideline range. She further contends that her motion under Rule 35(a) was timely, because she filed this motion several days after the court remanded her into custody to serve her sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-5\">Guerra also argues that the district court\u2019s criminal forfeiture order violates the Eighth Amendment\u2019s prohibition on excessive fines, as the amount that she was ordered to forfeit was disproportionate to the gravity of her offenses. In her initial brief and in her reply brief, Guerra raises various arguments as to why the court had jurisdiction to vacate or modify its forfeiture order, and as to why we should consider her arguments regarding the forfeiture order on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-6\">For the reasons set forth below, we affirm in part, and dismiss in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-8\">In June 2005, Guerra was convicted of the following offenses: (1) 1 count of conspiracy to defraud the United States, to commit health care fraud, and to pay kickbacks, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371 (\u201ccount 1\u201d); (2) 15 counts of health care fraud, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1347 and 2 (counts 2, 4, 6-7, 9-13, 15-20); (3) 1 count of conspiracy to commit money laundering, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1956(h) (\u201ccount 21\u201d); and (4) 3 counts of money laundering, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1956(a)(l)(B)(i) and 2 (\u201ccounts 24, 27-28\u201d). The district court entered a preliminary order of forfeiture, directing that Guerra forfeit real and personal property to the United States, including a monetary sum of $9,405,114.90. The court subsequently entered a judgment sentencing Guerra to a total term of 99 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-10\">In May 2007, we entered an opinion vacating Guerra\u2019s convictions as to the health care fraud offenses charged in counts 2, 4, and 7. <em>See United States v. Medina, </em>485 F.3d 1291, 1300 (11th Cir.2007). In addition, we remanded for resen-tencing, as the district court had failed to make specific factual findings in support of its determination of the loss amount used to calculate Guerra\u2019s guideline range. <em>See id. </em>at 1303-05. Shortly after we entered our decision, Guerra was released from prison on bond.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-11\">On remand, the court calculated Guerra\u2019s guideline range based on the money laundering guidelines set forth in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2S1.1. Applying these guidelines, the court found that Guerra\u2019s base offense level was 6, and that this offense level should be increased by 14 levels pursuant to \u00a7 2S1.2(a)(2), because Guerra was responsible for more than $400,000 in laundered funds. After applying additional increases and adjustments, the court determined that Guerra\u2019s total offense level was 26, which, when combined with her criminal history category of I, produced a guideline range of 63 to 70 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-12\">In February 2008, the court entered an amended judgment, in which it adjudicated Guerra guilty as to counts 1, 6, 9-13, 15-21, 24, and 27-28. The court resen-tenced Guerra to a total term of 70 months\u2019 imprisonment. In addition, the court amended the preliminary order of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"814\">*814</page-number>forfeiture to specify that Guerra would forfeit a monetary sum of $7,641,968.98. The court further specified that, if the ordered forfeiture amount was later found to be incorrect, a maximum fine of $1,300,000.00 would be imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-4\">Guerra again appealed from her convictions and sentences. <em>See United States v. Guerra, </em>307 Fed.Appx. 283 (11th Cir.2009). In January 2009, we entered an opinion in which we noted that, in calculating Guerra\u2019s guideline range, the district court incorrectly had applied the guidelines applicable to money laundering offenses, under \u00a7 2S1.1, instead of the guidelines applicable to Guerra\u2019s underlying offenses of health care fraud, under \u00a7 2B1.1. <em>Id. </em>at 287. We explained that, because the court had erred in applying the money laundering guidelines, it had erred in increasing Guerra\u2019s offense level by 14 levels pursuant to \u00a7 2Sl.l(a)(2). We further noted that, under the health care fraud guidelines, Guerra\u2019s correct total offense level was 12, with a resulting guideline range of 10 to 16 months\u2019 imprisonment. <em>Id. </em>Nevertheless, we held that the district court\u2019s error in calculating Guerra\u2019s guideline range was harmless, because: (1) the record showed that the court would have imposed the same sentence even if it had calculated Guerra\u2019s guideline range correctly, and (2) a 70-month sentence was reasonable in this case. <em>Id. </em>at 287-88. The mandate issued in April 2007. Guerra filed a petition for a writ of <em>certiorari </em>to the Supreme Court, and the Supreme Court denied <em>certiorari. See Guerra v. United States, </em>558 U.S.-, 130 S.Ct. 58, 175 L.Ed.2d 23 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b838-7\">After the Supreme Court denied <em>certio-rari, </em>the government filed a motion to remand Guerra into custody. The court granted the government\u2019s motion, ordering that Guerra be remanded into custody to serve the remainder of her sentence. Several days after the court entered this order, Guerra, through counsel, filed a motion to correct her sentence, pursuant to Fed.R.Crim.P. 35(a) and 36. In her motion, Guerra asserted that, in our January 2009 opinion, we \u201creversed\u201d the 14-level increase to her offense level under \u00a7 2Sl.l(a)(2), and held that her correct guideline range was 10 to 16 months\u2019 imprisonment. Guerra also asserted that her 70-month sentence constituted a 700% upward variance from her correct guideline range, and stated that, in the event that this variance \u201cwas the result of an arithmetical error,\u201d she requested that the court correct the error, as it resulted in an unreasonable sentence. In addition, Guerra asserted that the court had imposed a fine of $1,300,000, and stated that, if the $1,300,000 fine resulted from an arithmetical error, she requested that it be corrected.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-9\">On the following day, Guerra, again represented by counsel, filed a separate motion under Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b), requesting that the court vacate the amended $7,641,968.98 forfeiture order. She argued that the amount was inequitable, and that the court had jurisdiction to modify or vacate its forfeiture order.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-10\">The government responded, arguing, among other things, that the court lacked jurisdiction to grant relief based on Guerra\u2019s motions under Fed.R.Crim.P. 35(a) and 36 and Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b), because we had affirmed her convictions and sentence, and the doctrine of <em>res judicata </em>barred her attempt to relitigate sentencing issues. After the parties filed additional pleadings related to Guerra\u2019s motions under Fed. R.Civ.P. 35(a) and 36, and Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b), the court held a hearing to allow Guerra to clarify the grounds on which she sought post-judgment relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-11\">At the hearing, Guerra reasserted her argument that we reversed her 70-month <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"815\">*815</page-number>sentence in our January 2009 opinion. The court stated that it believed that a 70-month sentence was appropriate, and that, even if it were to resentence Guerra based on a guideline range of 10 to 16 months\u2019 imprisonment, it again would impose a 70-month sentence. The court- also found that, because we had affirmed Guerra\u2019s sentence, it lacked jurisdiction to modify the sentence. The court added that it found that the government\u2019s argument\u2014 that the doctrine of <em>res judicata </em>barred Guerra\u2019s attempt to relitigate sentencing issues \u2014 was persuasive. The court stated that it would deny \u201cboth motions\u201d because it lacked jurisdiction to grant the relief that Guerra requested. During the hearing, the parties and the court did not specifically mention Guerra\u2019s motion to vacate or modify the forfeiture order under Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b839-5\">On December 17, 2009, the court entered an \u201cOrder Denying Defendant\u2019s Rules 35(a) and 36 Motion for Correction of Sentence.\u201d In its order, the court stated that it had reviewed Guerra\u2019s \u201cmotions\u201d to correct her sentence under Rules 35(a) and 36, and specified the docket number for Guerra\u2019s motion under Rules 35(a) and 36. In its order, the court did not mention Guerra\u2019s separate motion under Fed. R.Civ.P. 60(b), nor did it refer to the docket number for this motion. In her notice of appeal, Guerra stated that she appealed \u201cfrom the district court order of December 17, 2009, denying [the] [defendant's Rules 35(a) and 36 Motion for [C]orrection of [S]entence and Rule 60(b) Motion for Relief [f]rom Forfeiture Judgement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b839-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-7\">We review <em>de novo </em>the issue of whether a district court possesses jurisdiction to resentence a defendant. <em>United States v. Diaz-Clark, </em>292 F.3d 1310, 1315 (11th Cir.2002). We review a district court\u2019s application of the law-of-the-case doctrine <em>de novo. United States v. Bobo, </em>419 F.3d 1264, 1267 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b839-9\">Under the law-of-the-case doctrine, \u201can appellate decision binds all subsequent proceedings in the same case.\u201d <em>United States v. Amedeo, </em>487 F.3d 823, 829-30 (11th Cir.2007) (quotation omitted). \u201cAn appellate decision binds all subsequent proceedings in the same case not only as to explicit rulings, but also as to issues decided necessarily by implication on the prior appeal.\u201d <em>United States v. Tamayo, </em>80 F.3d 1514, 1520 (11th Cir.1996). Pursuant to the mandate rule, which is an application of the law-of-the-case doctrine, a district court may not vary an appellate court\u2019s mandate, nor may it \u201cexamine [the mandate] for any other purpose than execution; or give any other or further relief; or review it, even for apparent error, upon a matter decided on appeal; or intermed-dle with it, further than to settle so much as has been remanded.\u201d <em>Amedeo, </em>487 F.3d at 830. (quotation omitted). There are three exceptions to the applicability of the law-of-the-case doctrine and the mandate rule: \u201c(1) a subsequent trial produces substantially different evidence, (2) controlling authority has since made a contrary decision of law applicable to that issue, or (3) the prior appellate decision was clearly erroneous and would work manifest injustice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation and alteration omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b839-10\">\u201cThe authority of a district court to modify an imprisonment sentence is narrowly limited by statute.\u201d <em>United States v. Phillips, </em>597 F.3d 1190, 1194-95 (11th Cir.2010). Specifically, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c) provides that a district court \u201cmay not modify a term of imprisonment once it has been imposed\u201d unless one of the following situations applies: (1) the Director of the U.S. Bureau of Prisons moves to reduce the defendant\u2019s term of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"816\">*816</page-number>imprisonment; (2) a modification otherwise is expressly permitted by statute, or by Fed.R.Crim.P. 35; or (3) the defendant was sentenced based on a guideline range that subsequently was reduced by the U.S. Sentencing Commission, and a reduction is consistent with the Commission\u2019s policy statements. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c); <em>Phillips, </em>597 F.3d at 1195. \u201cThe unambiguous language of \u00a7 3582(c)(1)(B) indicates that, absent other express statutory authority, modification of an imprisonment sentence can only be done pursuant to Rule 35.\u201d <em>Phillips, </em>597 F.3d at 1195. Outside of the parameters set forth by federal sentencing statutes and the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, a district court may not invoke an \u201cinherent power\u201d to correct a sentence, even where the sentence is illegal. <em>Diaz-Clark, </em>292 F.3d at 1315, 1319.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-4\">At the time that Guerra filed her motion under Rules 35(a) and 36, Rule 35(a) provided that, \u201c[w]ithin 7 days after sentencing, the court may correct a sentence that resulted from arithmetical, technical, or other clear error.\u201d Fed.R.Crim.P. 35(a).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> This seven-day time period is jurisdictional, and, as a result, a court\u2019s attempt to amend a sentence under Rule 35(a) after the prescribed time period is a \u201clegal nullity.\u201d <em>Phillips, </em>597 F.3d at 1196.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-5\">Rule 36 provides that, \u201cafter giving any notice it considers appropriate, the court may at any time correct a clerical error in a judgment, order, or other part of the record, or correct an error in the record arising from oversight or omission.\u201d Fed. R.Crim.P. 36. \u201cRule 36 may not be used to make a substantive alteration to a criminal sentence.\u201d <em>United States v. Portillo, </em>363 F.3d 1161, 1164 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b840-8\">Here, the district court correctly found that it lacked jurisdiction to grant relief based on Guerra\u2019s motion to correct her sentence under Fed.R.Crim.P. 35(a) and 36. We affirmed Guerra\u2019s sentence in our January 2009 opinion, and the mandate did not provide the court with authority to modify Guerra\u2019s sentence. <em>See Amedeo, </em>487 F.3d at 830. Guerra\u2019s contention that we reversed her sentence is erroneous, as we affirmed her sentence, expressly holding that the district court\u2019s error in calculating Guerra\u2019s guideline range was harmless, and that her 70-month sentence was reasonable. <em>See Guerra, </em>307 Fed.Appx. at 287-88. Although Guerra argues that the criminal judgment in her case has resulted in manifest injustice, we implicitly rejected this argument by holding that her sentence was reasonable. <em>See Tamayo, </em>80 F.3d at 1520. In her pleadings below and on appeal, Guerra has not identified intervening controlling authority or new evidence that would demonstrate that an exception to the law-of-the-case doctrine and the mandate rule applies, nor has she demonstrated that our January 2009 decision was \u201cclearly erroneous\u201d or may result in \u201cmanifest injustice.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b840-9\">Moreover, Guerra has failed to identify any applicable statute or rule that provided the court with jurisdiction to modify her sentence. While Guerra relied on Fed.R.Crim.P. 35(a), this rule did not provide a jurisdictional basis for the court to reduce her sentence, because she filed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"817\">*817</page-number>her motion well over a year after her resentencing, and the court thus did not act within seven days of sentencing. <em>See Phillips, </em>597 F.3d at 1196. Although Guerra contends that her motion was timely because she filed it several days after the court remanded her into custody, Rule 35(a) expressly provides that its limitations period is triggered by the date of sentencing, and Guerra does not cite to any authority in support of her argument that the date that a defendant is remanded into custody may serve as the triggering date. Rule 36 likewise did not provide a jurisdictional basis for the court to modify Guerra\u2019s sentence, as Guerra\u2019s request that the court reduce her 70-month sentence constituted a request to substantively alter the court\u2019s judgment. <em>See Portillo, </em>363 F.3d at 1164. Finally, Guerra does not assert,' nor does the record demonstrate, that any of the other bases for a sentence reduction set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c) are applicable in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-5\">Because Guerra has failed to identify a jurisdictional basis that would have permitted the court to modify her sentence, we affirm as to this issue, and need not address Guerra\u2019s arguments that her sentence was vindictive, and that it violated the Eighth Amendment as well as the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Apprendi.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b841-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-7\">We are obligated to address questions concerning our jurisdiction <em>sua sponte. Thomas v. Blue Cross and Blue Shield Ass\u2019n, </em>594 F.3d 823, 828 (11th Cir.2010). Our \u201cjurisdiction is ordinarily limited to appeals from final decisions of the district courts.\u201d <em>Id.; </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We have explained that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b841-8\">In postjudgment proceedings, the meaning of a \u201cfinal decision\u201d [may not be] clear because the proceedings necessarily follow a final judgment. Post-judgment decisions are themselves subject to the test of finality ... [a] postjudgment order is final for purposes of section 1291 only if the order disposes of all issues raised in the motion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b841-10\"><em>Id. </em>(quotations omitted). \u201cIf a post-judgment order is apparently the last order to be entered in the action, it is final and appealable.\u201d <em>Delaney\u2019s Inc. v. Ill. Union Ins. Co., </em>894 F.2d 1300, 1304 (11th Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b841-11\">Although neither party contests our jurisdiction to consider Guerra\u2019s arguments regarding her motion under Fed. R.Civ.P. 60(b), we <em>sua sponte </em>consider this issue and dismiss this portion of Guerra\u2019s appeal. <em>See Thomas, </em>594 F.3d at 828. Because the court did not enter an order disposing of Guerra\u2019s separate motion under Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b), there is no final decision by the district court within the meaning of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. In denying Guerra\u2019s motion under Fed.R.Crim.P. 35(a) and 36, the court stated that it was denying Guerra\u2019s \u201cmotions,\u201d but expressly referred only to Guerra\u2019s motion under Rules 35(a) and 36, and did not mention the docket number for her motion under Rule 60(b). As a result, the court\u2019s order denying Guerra\u2019s motion under Rules 35(a) and 36 cannot also be construed as a final order disposing of her Rule 60(b) motion. Because the record does not include a final order disposing of Guerra\u2019s Rule 60(b) motion, we dismiss this issue for lack of jurisdiction. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-12\">AFFIRMED IN PART; DISMISSED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b840-6\">. Effective December 1, 2009, Rule 35(a) provides that a court may correct a sentence within 14 days after sentencing. <em>See </em>Fed. R.Crim.P. 35(a) (2009). Guerra filed her motion under Rules 35(a) and 36 on November 28, 2009, a couple of days before the 2009 amendments to Rule 35(a) took effect. At the time that the court entered its order disposing of this motion, however, the 2009 amendments had taken effect. Nevertheless, even if the 2009 amendments applied in this case, Guerra filed her motion under Rules 35(a) and 36 more than a year after resentencing, well beyond the time period prescribed by either version of Rule 35(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
