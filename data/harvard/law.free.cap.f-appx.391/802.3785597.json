On appeal, Pegasus contends: (1) the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 (BAPCPA) precluded dismissal of the case, (2) the bankruptcy filing was required by Nevada law, and (3) dismissal is a severe remedy.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> After review, we conclude all of Pegasus\u2019s arguments lack merit.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1028-20\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1028-21\">Pegasus contends BAPCPA circumscribed the bankruptcy court\u2019s discretion to dismiss the case for cause. With regard to \u00a7 1112, BAPCPA made dismissal or conversion mandatory upon a showing of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"803\">*803</page-number>cause subject to specified exceptions. .Pegasus does not explain how BAPCPA precludes, rather than mandates, dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1029-12\">Section 1112(b) provides in pertinent part that a bankruptcy court \u201cshall\u201d dismiss or convert a bankruptcy case for \u201ccause\u201d unless \u201cunusual circumstances specifically identified by the court ... establish that the requested conversion or dismissal is not in the best interests of creditors and the estate....\u201d 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1112(b)(1). We have held cause for dismissal exists when a bankruptcy petition was not filed in good faith. <em>See In re Phoenix Piccadilly, Ltd., </em>849 F.2d 1393, 1394 (11th Cir.1988); <em>In re Albany Partners, Ltd., </em>749 F.2d 670, 674 (11th Cir.1984). Dismissal is particularly appropriate \u201cwhen there is no realistic possibility of an effective reorganization and it is evident that the debtor seeks merely to delay or frustrate the legitimate efforts of secured creditors to enforce their rights.\u201d <em>In re Albany Partners, </em>749 F.2d at 674.</p>\n<p id=\"b1029-13\">Here, the bankruptcy court determined cause for dismissal existed because the case was not filed in good faith.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The bankruptcy court based its decision on, <em>inter alia, </em>Pegasus\u2019s repeated violation of California state court orders, the \u201cfabricated\u201d testimony of Pegasus\u2019s Chief Financial Officer at the evidentiary hearing, and Pegasus\u2019s failure to demonstrate any attempt at reorganization after its bankruptcy filings. The bankruptcy court explicitly noted there were no \u201cunusual circumstances\u201d and concluded dismissal, rather than conversion, was m the best interests of the creditors and the estate.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Based on the bankruptcy court\u2019s findings, which Pegasus does not dispute, the dismissal for cause was not an abuse of discretion. Pegasus\u2019s contention that BAPCPA somehow precluded this result is wholly without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"ACP\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"AWQ\">Pegasus argues the bankruptcy filing was required under Nevada law, which imposes fiduciary duties on officers and directors with respect to creditors of an insolvent corporation. This issue is merit-less, as Pegasus fails to cite any authority holding that state law can abrogate the authority vested in federal bankruptcy judges to dismiss actions for cause under \u00a7 1112(b).</p>\n<p id=\"A7ot\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"AJq7\">Finally, Pegasus contends dismissal is a \u201csevere remedy reserved for the most severe behavior.\u201d As explained above, the bankruptcy court did not abuse its discretion by dismissing this case for cause under \u00a7 1112(b). Moreover, it is clear Pegasus filed this bankruptcy petition for the purpose of avoiding its obligations to Ap-pellee. Pegasus\u2019s egregious conduct easily constitutes \u201csevere behavior.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AypF\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1028-14\">. Only the first issue was presented to the district court, and none of the issues were presented to the bankruptcy court. We generally will not consider issues raised for the first time on appeal. <em>In re Pan American World Airways, Inc., </em>905 F.2d 1457, 1461-62 (11th Cir.1990). Nevertheless, we review each issue and find them without merit.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1028-22\">. As the \"second court of review\u201d of the bankruptcy court's judgment, \"we independently examine the factual and legal determinations of the bankruptcy court and employ the same standards of review as the district court.\u201d <em>In re Int'l Admin. Servs., Inc., </em>408 F.3d 689, 698 (11th Cir.2005). Pegasus does not challenge any factual determinations on appeal; thus, we accept the bankruptcy court\u2019s factual findings as true. <em>See Brinson v. Raytheon Co., </em>571 F.3d 1348, 1350 n. 1 (11th Cir.2009). We review legal conclusions <em>de novo, In re Bilzerian, </em>100 F.3d 886, 889 (11th Cir.1996), and dismissals pursuant to \u00a7 1112(b) for abuse of discretion, <em>In re Bal Harbour Club, Inc., </em>316 F.3d 1192, 1194-95 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1029-14\">. The bankruptcy court also determined cause existed under \u00a7 1112(b)(4)(B) based on \u201cgross mismanagement of the estatef,]\u201d and under \u00a7 1112(b)(4)(A) as a result of \"substantial or continuing loss to or diminution of the estate and the absence of a reasonable likelihood of rehabilitation.\u201d 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1112(b)(4)(A), (B).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1029-15\">. In its reply brief, Pegasus argues conversion, rather than dismissal, would be in the best interests of the creditors and the estate. Arguments raised for the first time in the reply brief are deemed waived. <em>In re Egidi, </em>571 F.3d 1156, 1163 (11th Cir.2009). Regardless, this issue is meritless. The bankruptcy court explicitly considered conversion as an alternative to dismissal and did not err in concluding dismissal was the best course of action.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
