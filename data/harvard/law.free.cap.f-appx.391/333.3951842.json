Citing 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B) and 1915A(b)(l), the district court dismissed the complaint as frivolous and for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. Johnson will be permitted to pursue his appeal as a pauper if his IFP motion in this court is timely, he is a pauper, and the appeal is taken in good faith, i.e., is nonfrivolous. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 24(a)(5); <em>see also Carson v. Polley, </em>689 F.2d 562, 586 (5th Cir.1982). Because the district court based its decision on \u00a7 1915 and \u00a7 1915A both, review is de novo. <em>Geiger v. Jowers, </em>404 F.3d 371, 373 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b358-12\">Johnson makes clear that his complaint is that the defendants violated their official duties imposed by the Louisiana statutes governing access to public records and by the Louisiana Constitution. Johnson\u2019s claim for declaratory and injunctive relief amounts to a request for a writ of mandamus against state officials, which is not authorized by \u00a7 1983 if no other relief is sought. <em>See Moye v. Clerk, DeKalb County Superior Court, </em>474 F.2d 1275, 1276 (5th Cir.1973). Johnson\u2019s complaint states no basis for mandamus relief or for any other relief. Johnson does not even explain why he wants the records and how not having them has harmed him; there is no claim that Johnson has even attempted to file any action in state court in which the requested records might be needed.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-13\">A matter is frivolous if it presents no \u201clegal points arguable on their merits.\u201d <em>Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Under 5th Cir. R. 42.2, we may dismiss a frivolous appeal sua sponte. <em>Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 n. 24 (5th Cir.1997). Johnson presents no issue that is not frivolous. <em>See Howard, </em>707 F.2d at 220. Johnson has failed to show that the district court\u2019s dismissal of his complaint should be reversed. <em>See Geiger, </em>404 F.3d at 373.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-14\">The district court\u2019s dismissal of Johnson\u2019s suit counts as a strike under \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 385-87 (5th Cir.1996). So does this court\u2019s dismissal of this appeal. <em>See id. </em>at 388. Additionally, Johnson already had two strikes before he filed this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>suit. <em>See Johnson v. Moore, </em>816 Fed.Appx. 347, 348 (5th Cir.2009), and <em>Johnson v. Orleans Indigent, </em>70 F.3d 1268, 1995 WL 696720, at *1 (5th Cir.1995). Because Johnson has accumulated at least three strikes, he is barred from proceeding IFP in a civil action or an appeal from a judgment in a civil action or proceeding under \u00a7 1915 unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">MOTION TO FILE SUPPLEMENTAL BRIEF GRANTED; MOTION TO PROCEED IFP DENIED; APPEAL DISMISSED; 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g) BAR IMPOSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b358-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
