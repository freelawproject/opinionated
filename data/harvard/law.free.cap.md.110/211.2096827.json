The evidence on the part of the defendant was that the car was drifting down grade, without power, at a speed of about four miles an hour; that the motorman noticed the little girl standing at the far corner of the street; that when the car had reached the cross street she made a dash to run across and ran into the front of the car, which knocked her down; that the rails were slippery on account of the damp weather; that as soon as the motorman saw <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>the child start to cross he applied the brakes, used sand and tried to stop the car and did stop it within a length and a half, and that the gong was sounded before reaching the corner. <em>Held, </em>that the plaintiff\u2019s evidence, if found to be true by the jury, is legally sufficient to entitle the plaintiff to recover.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b240-5\"><em>Held, </em>further, that although the plaintiff and her parents may have been guilty of negligence, yet the plaintiff is entitled to recover if the jury find that the motorman of the car, by the exercise of ordinary care, might have seen the child and stopped the ear- in time to avoid the accident.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b240-6\"><em>Held, </em>further, that the. jury was properly instructed that the plaintiff was entitled to recover if the injury could have been avoided by the exercise of ordinary care on the part of the defendant, unless they find that the injury resulted from want of such care on the part of the plaintiff as ought to have been reasonably expected from one of her age, or from the want of ordinary care on the part of her parents, directly contributing to the accident.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b240-7\">A child is only bound to exercise such degree of care as may be \u25a0 expected from one of its age, and when it is seen to be about to cross a street, the motorman of a street car is required to exercise a greater degree of care to avoid a collision than is necessary in the case of an adult in a similar position.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b240-8\">The trial Judge has the right at any time during the trial to modify bis instructions to the jury or to revoke them.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b240-9\">At the close of the evidence, in an action for personal injuries and after prayers had been granted, including one relating to the elements constituting the damages that, the plaintiff might be entitled to recover, the trial Court stated that certain evi- ' dence relating to the possible effect of the injury had been erroneously admitted, and that, upon motion, he would exclude it. The defendant refused to make such motion, although it had objected to the admission of the evidence. Then the Court, on its own motion, modified plaintiff\u2019s granted prayer as to the measure of damages by directing the jury not to consider that effect of the injuries as testified to by a certain witness. After plaintiff\u2019s counsel began his opening address to the jury, the defendant\u2019s special exceptions to the plaintiff\u2019s prayer re- <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>- lating to damages were given to the Court, and the Court modified the granted prayer as to damages by striking out that part relating to the industrial pursuits for which, in the absence of the injury, the plaintiff would be qualified. The Court then read to the jury the prayer as modified. <em>Held, </em>that defendant cannot complain of this modification of the instructions which were made practically at its own instance.</syllabus>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b241-5\">\n<em>Decided February 17th, 1909.</em>\n</decisiondate>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\"

that the plaintiff intended to cross in front of his car until the car was so close to the plaintiff that the accident could not have been avoided by the motorman by the exercise of the ordinary

<em>(Refused.)</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b243-9\">And thereupon the Court stated in open Court that its lulling, made earlier in the trial, in permitting Dr. Eumsey to testify in the plaintiff\u2019s behalf, that the injuries sustained by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>the plaintiff might possibly affect her in the event of childbearing was, he now thought, too broad and was erroneous, and suggested to defendant\u2019s counsel to move to strike out said evidence admitted over its objections, and that thereupon the Court would grant such motion and exclude such testimony from the consideration of the jury.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b244-5\">But the defendant\u2019s counsel refusing in open Court to make such motion, the Court thereupon of its own motion modified the plaintiff\u2019s fourth prayer by adding thereto the following words:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b244-6\">\u201cBut the jury are not- to award any damages for any injuries except those proved by the evidence with a reasonable certainty, and the

The Court therefore overruled the defendant\u2019s special exceptions to the plaintiff\u2019s first and second prayers and granted the defendant\u2019s special exception to the plaintiff\u2019s fourth prayer, and modified the plaintiff\u2019s fourth prayer by striking out from the prayer as modified and granted and read to the jury, the following words: \u201cand how far it is calculated to disable the plaintiff from engaging in those industrial pursuits and employments for which, in the absence of such injury, she would be qualified.\u201d The Court stated to the jury that he would read to them the prayer as modified and corrected by him and accordingly read to the jury the plaintiff\u2019s fourth prayer as modified, as follows: \u201cIf the jury find for the plaintiff, in estimating the damages, they are to consider the health and condition of the plaintiff before the injury complained of as compared with her present condition, in consequence of said injury, and whether said injury is in its nature permanent, and also the physical and mental suffering to which she was subjected by reason of the said injury, and to allow such damages as in the opinion of the said jury will be a fair and just compensation for the injury which the plaintiff has sustained.

City Pass. Ry. Co. </em>v. Cooney, 87 Md. 261; <em>Stabnew </em>v. <em>At. Ave. R. R. Co., </em>155 N.

Co., </em>94 Md. 719.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b246-9\">In the cases just cited it is held that a railway company is liable if the motorman could have avoided the accident after he saw or ought to have seen the plaintiff\u2019s peril. This modification of the general rule was fully considered in <em>Consolidated Railway Co. </em>v. <em>Armstrong, </em>92 Md. 554, where it is said: \u201cBut in order that this qualification of or exception to the general rule may be successfully invoked by the plaintiff, he must show knowledge on the part of the defendant, or its agents, of the peril in which he (the plaintiff) was placed, and that there was time after such knowledge within which to make an effort to save him from impending danger.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b247-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>This being the law, it was incumbent on the plaintiff here to prove that at the time the infant plaintiff left the pavement and started across the street the car was far enough away to have been stopped by the exercise of due care in time to have avoided the injury.</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b247-5\">The defendant\u2019s testimony clearly proved that the infant plaintiff was in a place of safety on the pavement, at the southeast corner of St. Paul and Twenty-third streets, and that she started to cross the street when the front of the ear was in the middle of Twenty-third street; and that the motorman did all in his power to stop the car, the moment she started across. The fact that he did stop the car when the rear platform was opposite the crossing, is borne out not only by the defendant\u2019s testimony, but by the plaintiff\u2019s, and this certainly shows the utmost effort on his part. There is not a scintilla of evidence to show that from the moment the infant plaintiff left the pavement, the motorman of the defendant\u2019s car did not do all in his power to avoid injuring her.</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b247-6\">Erom the testimony of the plaintiff\u2019s witnesses, it is not possible to say where the car was when the child started across the street, but if it proves anything at all, it does prove that the car was close upon her.</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b247-7\">The colored man, Lewis, stated positively that he did not know where the car was when the child started, but that the car was close upon the child is clearly apparent from his evidence, for he says that she screamed when she started to run, and, to quote his own words: \u201cI said that child is gone, and almost in the time I could say that the car had struck her.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b247-8\">Even if we should take the view that Mrs. Miller saw and was speaking about, the car concerned in the accident, and not another car, and that her opinion of the speed was correct\u2014 still there is not a scintilla of evidence that if the car had been going at an ordinary speed, or even as slow as four or five miles an hour, that it could have been stopped on a down grade with a slippery track; or even that with the rail, in good condition, the car could have been stopped in time to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>have avoided the accident. And upon her testimony the defendant\u2019s first prayer should have been granted. <em>C. &amp; P. R. R. </em>v. <em>State, </em>73 Md. 74; <em>Reidel </em>v. <em>P. W. &amp; B. R. Co., </em>87 Md. 153; <em>Hoffman </em>v. <em>Syracuse R. T. Co., </em>50 N. Y. App. Div. 83; <em>Molyneaux v. S. W. Mo. E. R. Co., </em>81 Mo. App. 25.</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b248-5\">\u25a0 We know of no case held to have been properly submitted to the jury, in.which there has not been some evidence of the relative positions of the injured person, and the car, when the peril to the person became apparent, while in the case at bar there is an absolute failure of evidence on the part of the plaintiff as to the location of the car when the peril of the plaintiff could have been seen.</p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b248-6\">That, the child ran into the side of the car is shown by-Lewis\u2019 testimony. In addition to this, we have the positive statements of the motorman and Murray, that the child ran into the side of the car. There was no evidence .of any negligence in the operation of the ear, or that it was running at an unlawful speed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Afu\">The plaintiff failing to show any negligence on the part of the defendant, and the defendant clearly proving itself free from negligence, the case should not have been submitted to the jury. The only evidence as to where the car was when the infant plaintiff started from the sidewalk, was given by the defendant, and the plaintiff did not even attempt to show that the car could have been stopped in any shorter distance than it was. <em>Siacik's Admr. </em>v. <em>N. C. Ry. Co., </em>92 Md. 213; <em>Egner </em>v. <em>United Rys., </em>98 Md. 400.</p>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b248-8\">Defendant\u2019s second prayer should have been granted. The action of the child must be regarded as negligent, unless the view'is taken that a child of that age is incapable of negligence. For, as was said by this Court in <em>Cumberland </em>v. <em>Lottig, </em>95 Md. 42, where a child came in contact with a wire on a roof: \u201cIf he was too young to know of the dangerous character of the wire, his mother\u2019s negligence must be imputed to him, and if he was old enough to know better than to take hold of the wire, his own negligence would be fatal to his case.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b249-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>If we take the view that the child was incapable of negligence, then her parents or custodians were negligent in allowing her to be upon a city street where trolley cars and numerous other vehicles were passing, and their negligence directly contributed to the accident, and there being no evidence that the car could have been stopped after the child should have been seen in dangerous proximity to the car, this prayer should have been granted. <em>B. &amp; O. </em>v. <em>State use of Fryer, </em>30 Md. 47; <em>Cumberland </em>v. <em>Lottig, </em>95 Md. 42; <em>Waite </em>v. <em>N.

Y.) 602; <em>Gibbons </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>135 Mass. 333; <em>Wabnich </em>v. <em>Dry Dock, etc., Ry. Co., </em>112 App. Div. (N. Y.) 4.</p>\n<p data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b249-5\">By granting the plaintiff\u2019s first prayer the jury were allowed to find for the plaintiff if they believed the accident could have been avoided by the exercise of ordinary care and prudence on the part of the defendant <em>at any time. </em>Such is not the law; it was only after the motorman saw or could have seen the peril of the infant plaintiff that the duty was imposed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b249-6\">Under this instruction the jury were entitled to find for the plaintiff if the motorman might have seen the child when his car was a square away, even though at that time the child was standing still on the pavement. They should have at least been instructed that it was only after the motorman might have seen the child <em>approaching the track </em>or <em>in a position of peril </em>that the duty to exercise care and caution to avoid injuring her arose. We contend that even in the form we have suggested the prayer would be improper; as it stands it is clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b249-7\">There was not only no evidence to support plaintiff\u2019s second prayer, but it is erroneous for the further reason that no duty rests upon the motorman of a street railway car to stop it when he sees a person on the sidewalk giving no evidence of an intention to cross. If such were law the operation of railways would be impossible. The duty never arises except when the person is <em>approaching the track </em>or <em>is in a position of peril. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number><em>Baltimore Traction Co. </em>v. <em>Wallace, 77 </em>Md. 435; <em>North Balto.

Co. </em>v. <em>Rifcowitz, </em>89 Md. 338.</p>\n<p data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b250-5\">This prayer amounted to a modification of the rule of contributory negligence, and the modification therein contained is substantially the same as was condemned in the case of <em>Consolidated Ry. Co. </em>v. <em>Armstrong, </em>92 Md. 554; <em>P. &amp; B. R. Co. </em>v. <em>Holden, </em>93 Md. 421.</p>\n<p data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b250-6\">The defendant\u2019s eighth prayer should have been granted in connection with its other prayers. It contained a correct proposition of law, as will be seen by reference to the case of <em>Bannon </em>v. <em>B. &amp; O. R. R., </em>24 Md. 108.</p>\n<p data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b250-7\">By the plaintiff\u2019s second prayer the jury were told that if they found that the motorman, by the exercise of ordinary care and caution, might have seen the child and stopped the car in time to have avoided the accident, the negligence of the mother would not prevent a recovery. Certainly, the defendant was entitled to have the jury instructed in this connection; that the infancy of the plaintiff does not change the degree of care and diligence to be used by the defendant in the manipulation of its cars.</p>\n<p data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b250-8\">Containing, as it did, a correct proposition of law, the defendant was further entitled to this instruction upon the ground that \u201cthe Court will always instruct the jury, if applied to, as to the degree of diligence or skill and care which the law imposes upon the respective parties, and the jury are to determine if the requisite conduct has been observed.\u201d <em>C. &amp; P.

This alone would be <em>prima facie </em>proof that she was exposed through the negligence of her mother, under whose charge she was, and that that negligence contributed to her injury <em>(Wright </em>v. <em>R. R., </em>4 Allen, 283), but it would not be conclusive upon either point. The plaintiff could show that the negligence of the mother did not contribute to the injury by proving that the child did not in fact do or omit any act in the occurrence, which common prudence forbade or required.\u201d <em>Gibbons v. </em>Williams, 135 Mass. 333.</p>\n<p data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b251-5\">Not only was this <em>prima facie </em>proof not rebutted by her mother, but the jury might well have inferred from the testimony of Mrs. Carneal that she or the person in charge of the child was negligent in the care of the infant plaintiff in allowing it to run at large upon a street where electric cars and numerous other vehicles passed. Her testimony was as follows: \u201cOn the morning of the accident she was sewing, and left two of her children, one of whom was Mamie, playing around the kitchen door and in the yard. The younger one became sleepy and she took her upstairs and put her to bed, and when she came down she missed Mamie and inquired of the nurse where she was. The nurse thought the child had gone upstairs, but the witness knew she had not, and seeing the back gate open, rushed out and was told there had been an accident.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b251-6\">That there was evidence to support this prayer is conceded by the plaintiff\u2019s second prayer. Surely it is a poor rule which does not work both ways, and if the plaintiff was granted an instruction that the negligence of the child\u2019s mother would not prevent a recovery if the jury found that the motorman could have avoided the consequences of her negligence (which latter part of the prayer was specially excepted to), the defendant was entitled to a corresponding instruction that if the jury found that the negligence of the parents or those in charge of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>the child was the direct cause of the injury, then there could be no recovery.</p>\n<p data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b252-5\">The question in the first exception should not have been allowed. Striking out the answer would not cure the evil done. <em>Rosenstock </em>v. Tormey, 32 Md. 170-182. Even if it were possible to think that striking out the answer would be sufficient, the Court did not strike it out, but invented a method of its own.</p>\n<p data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b252-6\">The Court modified the plaintiff\u2019s fourth prayer in regard to the testimony of Dr. Charles D. Rumsey excepted to in the defendant\u2019s first exception. This was surely an unusual method of procedure and could not but be prejudicial to the defendant in that it emphasized Dr. Rumsey\u2019s testimony, and -brought it forcibly to the minds of the jurors, rather than excluding it from their consideration. The usual method a . Court pursues to accomplish the result which the Court herein intended to- accomplish, is for the Court to strike out the evidence from the record and instruct the jury not to regard the same. But in this instance the Court failed to do so, leaving the evidence in the record qnd modifying a long dam-* age prayer by a statement to the jury that the evidence was too vague to be considered by them.</p>\n<p data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b252-7\">The Court did not wait until the defendant\u2019s counsel could prepare special exceptions to the plaintiff\u2019s prayers before argument to the jury.</p>\n<p data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b252-8\">The defendant\u2019s counsel stated to the Court (hat he wished to prepare and file special exceptions to the plaintiff\u2019s prayers. The Court .then stated that he supposed these special exceptions were the usual formal exceptions, and, if so, he would not delay the case, but pass upon the prayers at once, giving the defendant leave to reduce its special exceptions to writing later, and there being no dissent or objection to this course (and certainly there was no reason for dissent or objection to the Court\u2019s statement, there being nothing unusual or informal in the-special exceptions), argument was heard, and after such argument, the Court granted the plaintiff\u2019s first and second prayers, and, of its own motion, modified the plaintiff\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>fourth prayer by adding thereto the following words: \u201cBut the jury are not to award any damages for any injuries except those proved by the evidence with a reasonable certainty, and the testimony of Dr. Charles D. Rumsey as to the effect of the injuries to the pelvis testified to by him upon childbearing by the plaintiff is too vague to be considered by the jury,\u201d and granted the said prayer as thus modified. The Court then read both sets of prayers to the jury.</p>\n<p data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b253-5\">The special exceptions in the usual form were presented to the Court and acted upon by him, and the fourth prayer was again modified. The Court then did not simply tell the jury that he had modified a prayer or the prayers, or read then all of the instructions anew, but waited until the end of a moving address by the plaintiff\u2019s counsel, and then read to the jury the damage prayers as modified the second time. Surely this would naturally tend to mislead the minds of the jury and lead them to believe that the only thing for them to consider was the amount of the damages, and to lead them to disgard the important question as to whether the defendant was the cause of the injuries, especially as the form of the prayer is such that it practically assumes that there will be a verdict for the plaintiff.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b253-6\"><em>William Colton </em>and <em>John Philip </em>Hill, for the appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"66\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b253-7\">It will be observed by inspection and comparison of the plaintiff\u2019s first and second prayers that the language is precisely the same as the first and third prayers approved in <em>City Pass. Ry. Co. </em>v. <em>McDonnell, </em>43 Md. 535.</p>\n<p data-order=\"67\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b253-8\">If, therefore, the facts of the case at bar and the <em>McDonnell Case </em>are practically the same, the law of the appellee\u2019s case announced in said first and second prayers must be free from error.</p>\n<p data-order=\"68\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b253-9\">The defendant\u2019s eighth and ninth prayers were properly refused, because the propositions announced therein were fully covered by the plaintiff\u2019s said first and second prayers, and the multiplicity of prayers substantially the same on subjects about which the law has been thoroughly well settled is a prac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>tice much to he deprecated. <em>Agricultural &amp; Mechanical </em>Association <em>of Washington County </em>v. <em>State of Maryland, etc., </em>71 Md. 99. When the whole law of the case has been fairly submitted to the jury by the instruction actually given, a refusal to grant other prayers which reiterates the same principle in different words is not erroneous. <em>Storr </em>v. <em>James, </em>84 Md. 282; <em>McCarty </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>93 Md. 742.</p>\n<p data-order=\"69\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b254-5\">If, however, it may be contended that defendant\u2019s eighth and ninth prayers are not covered by plaintiff\u2019s said first and second prayers, then defendant\u2019s said prayers are misleading and otherwise erroneous and were properly refused.</p>\n<p data-order=\"70\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b254-6\">It is difficult to understand just how the learned counsel for the appellant may seriously argue in support of the propositions announced in appellant\u2019s first and second rejected prayers, and the several exceptions indicated, in respect of the plaintiff\u2019s first and second prayers.</p>\n<p data-order=\"71\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b254-7\">The testimony of the witness Mrs. Miller and the colored man Lewis tends to show that on the day of the accident to the little plaintiff the appellant\u2019s car moved rapidly south on St, Paul street, a much-traveled public thoroughfare of Baltimore City, the head of its motorman being so directed that it was quite impossible for him to observe any object upon its tracks in the bed of said thoroughfare while crossing said Twenty-third street; that the persistent attempts on the part of Mrs. Miller to attract his attention whilst standing at the northeast corner of St. Paul and Twenty-third street, so that she might take passage on his car, were wholly unavailing; that although the appellant\u2019s car was a hundred feet or about one hundred feet north of Twenty-third street, at the time the little plaintiff started to run from the northeast to the southwest comer of said St. Paul and Twenty-third streets, he failed to see her, and the car he was operating knocked her down and ran over her as she approached said southeast corner, the screams which she continuously uttered from the time or about the time she left said northeast comer, while running diagonally, as indicated, being unheard by him.</p>\n<p data-order=\"72\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b255-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>Had the motorman directed his attention in front of his car, he would have been able to observe not only the little plaintiff, as she ran from the northeast to the southwest corner of St. Paul street, at Twenty-third street, but also Mrs. Miller when she signalled unto him.</p>\n<p data-order=\"73\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b255-5\">The action of the appellant because of the modification of the appellee\u2019s fourth prayer is extraordinary \u2014 unprecedented. In effect, its position is that it asks the Court for a ruling in its favor along indicated lines, and when the Court grants such application, refuses to accept the result it sought to accomplish by such application.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"74\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b255-6\">Henry, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AOG\">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-7\">This is an appeal taken by the defendant below from a judgment for $7,500 rendered against it in the Baltimore City Court in an action by the appellee to recover damages for personal injuries sustained in an accident which occurred March 14th, 1907, at the corner of St. Paul and Twenty-third streets, in the City of Baltimore, and which it is charged in the declaration was the result of the negligence of the defendant, without any negligence on the part of the plaintiff directly contributing thereto.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-8\">In the Court below three exceptions were taken by the appellant, the first to the admissibility of certain testimony, and the second and third to the action of the Court upon the prayers offered by the litigant parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-9\">The first prayer of the defendant offered at the close of all the testimony, being in the nature of a demurrer to the evidence, brings up for review the testimony in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-10\">The plaintiff was a female infant, not quite three years of age, who had slipped away from her mother\u2019s home at 2234 North Calvert street, and had strayed from thence to the corner of St. Paul and Twenty-third street. The only eyewitness of the accident produced ou the part of the plaintiff was William A. Lewis, a colored wagon dxdver, whose testimony it is important to consider.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>In Ms examination in cMef tMs witness states: \u201cOn tMs morning I had on a load of furniture going up the right-hand side of St. Paul street, about 20 feet south of Twenty-tMrd street, when I saw this car coming, and I saw this little child start from that corner, which, I guess, is the northeast corner, to the southwest corner, and I saw tMs car coming at a good speed, and I said that child is gone, and almost in the time I could say that the car had struck her, and I thought it had cut her in half; and I got so nervous I didn\u2019t know what I was doing. I saw a lady standing on the corner trying to wave the car down in the first place, but the car didn\u2019t stop, . and this man didn\u2019t seem to see anyone, as he was looking towards to the college.\u201d The college referred to by tMs witness is the Woman\u2019s College, located on the west side of St. Paul street, between Twenty-third and Twenty-second streets, and which was to front and 'right of the car as it was going south down St. Paul street.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-6\">The witness further testified that when he first saw the car it was about 100 feet north of Twenty-third street; that it passed Twenty-third street pretty rapidly, but after the accident stopped about twenty-five feet south of said street. On cross-examination this witness stated that when he first saw the car it was about 100 feet north of Twenty-third street, and at that time the child was \u201cstanding still\u201d on the northeast corner of St. Paul and Twenty-third streets, and he could not tell how far the car had gone from this point, 100 feet above Twenty-third street, when the child started to cross the street. The witness first saw the motorman when the car struck the child, at which time his head was turned to the right and he had \u201cone hand on one thing and one hand on another,\u201d but didn\u2019t see him winding down, and also stated that the child,, the instam she started from the pavement, began to scream.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-7\">Mrs. J. R. Miller, another witness on the part of the plaintiff, stated that she was on the northeast corner of St. Paul and Twenty-third streets, but did not see either the child or the accident. She wanted to board the car and signalled the conductor to stop, but his attention seemed to be turned <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>toward the college and he didn\u2019t appear to see her, and that the car was going very rapidly.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">On behalf of the defendant Hoffman, the motorman, testified: \u201cJust as I was crossing the corner I noticed the child standing on the southeast corner of St. Paul and Twenty-third streets, and as my car got near, the front end very near the middle of the street, this child made a full dash and ran across the street and ran against the front side of the car, and it knocked her down.\u201d He further said that the car was drifting down grade, without power, at a speed of about four miles an hour; that the rails were slippery from the damp and misty weather, and that he applied the brakes and used sand and made every effort to stop the car as soon as he saw the child start to cross, and that he succeeded in stopping the car in about a length or a length and a half. That he sounded the gong coming down St. Paul street before he got to the comer.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-6\">Matthews, the conductor, corroborated the motorman as to the' speed of the car and the sounding of the gong.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-7\">David G. Murray, another witness on behalf of the defendant who saw the accident, testified that when the child started to cross th\u00e9 street from the southeast corner the car was about midway of Twenty-third street, going at a moderate speed, and that it seemed to him that the' child ran into the car rather than the ear running into the child.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-8\">Mrs. Geneva .S. Conrad testified that the car was going at a moderate speed, evidently slowing down'for the crossing.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-9\">Nelson Lloyd also saw the accident, and testified that'the car was going at a moderate speed; that the child started to cross the street when the car was half a length from her, and that the motorman seemed to do all he could to stop the car, but that the child ran right in front of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-10\">In consideration of the first prayer of the defendant, we must assume that' the plaintiff\u2019s evidence, although contradicted by that of the defendant, \u25a0 is true, and, so assuming, we think it was sufficient, as tending to show negligence on the part of the defendant, to take the case to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>Courts are cautious not to invade the province of the jury, and, although the question of negligence may become a matter of law, the circumstances of the case must be clear and decisive to justify a withdrawal of the case from the consideration of the jury. <em>McMahon </em>v. <em>N. C. R. R. Co., </em>39 Md. 438; <em>Consolidated Railway Co. </em>v. <em>Rifcowitz, </em>89 Md. 338; <em>B. &amp; O. R. R. Co. </em>v. <em>State, </em>36 Md. 366; <em>Cumberland Valley R. R. Co. </em>v. <em>Maugans, </em>61 Md. 60.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">As to the defendant\u2019s second prayer we think likewise that it was properly refused. In spite of the negligence of the plaintiff or of the parents of the plaintiff, lawfully imputable to her, she was still entitled to recover unless the jury should find that after the motorman saw, or could have seen, her peril he could not, by the exercise of ordinary care, have avoided the accident. So far as her conduct was concerned she could only be held to such a degree of care as might be expected from one of her age and intelligence. According to the testimony, the defendant was 100 feet away when he could have seen the infant on the street comer, and though the principal witness could not fix the distance that the car had proceeded from this 100-foot point when the plaintiff assumed a position of peril by starting to cross the street, yet under the general statement made we think it mjght well have been left to the jury to say if, in the exercise of ordinary care and caution, the motorman should not have brought , his car to such a degree of locomotion as would have enabled him to stop the same after seeing the peril of the plaintiff, it being his duty under all circumstances to have his car under better control at a street comer, where pedestrians usually cross, than in the middle of the block.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-6\">The evidence on the part of the plaintiff failed to locate the relative positions of the car and the child at the time the latter started to cross the street, but by several witnesses the defendant proved that the car was about midway of Twenty-third street when the child started to run across St. Paul street. The point of collision was about twenty-one feet from the curb near which the child had been standing, and about <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>twenty feet from the point where the motorman first saw the child. In an adnlt, or a yonth of maturer years, an attempt to cross under such conditions would have presented a different question for the consideration of the Court. But ordinary care is a relative term. The same standard is not expected of an infant as of a mature man. What would be regarded as careless and blameworthy in the one would not be necessarily so held in the case of the other. Each case must depend upon its own circumstances. In the case of <em>Consolidated Railway Co. </em>v. Rifcowitz, 89 Md. 338, a woman was injured at a street crossing by collision with a car. The car tracks were only six feet from the curb from which the woman started to cross and the car was only fifteen feet aw\u00e1y, although the woman testified that she looked before attempting to cross and saw no car coming. The car was going ten or eleven miles an hour. The Court declined to take the case from the jury on the theory that the car was going at a rapid speed, which should have been slackened as the crossing was approached, so that it might have been stopped promptly in case of necessity. In the case under consideration there is some evidence to show that the car was going \u201cvery rapidly\u201d and that the motorman could have seen the child when 100 feet away; that he was not looking ahead, but to the side of the car. Without passing upon the weight of this evidence, when contrasted with the evidence of the defendant, or intimating an opinion upon the verdict rendered, we think the question of contributory negligence was properly left to the jury. <em>Booth </em>v. <em>McLean Contracting Co., </em>108 Md. 456; <em>North Balto. Pass. Ry. Co. </em>v. <em>Arnreich, 7</em>8 Md. 589 ; <em>McMahon </em>v. <em>N. C. R. R. Co., </em>39 Md. 438; <em>McDonnell\u2019s Case, </em>43 Md. 535; <em>Wright </em>v. <em>M. &amp; M. R. R. Co., </em>4 Allen Rep. (Mass.); <em>Gibbons </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>135 Mass. 333.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">The plaintiff\u2019s first and second prayers correctly 'state the law in the case. They are reproduced from <em>McDonnell\u2019s Case, supra, </em>in which the facts are so similar as to make the same law applicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-6\">The rejection of the eighth and ninth prayers of the defendant we think was proper. By its sixth and seventh <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>\u25a0prayers, which were granted, the question of ordinary care was submitted in as favorable an aspect as the defendant could demand, and the eighth prayer was misleading because, as we have already stated in discussing the evidence, the child was only bound to the exercise of such care as might be expected from one of her age and intelligence, and when such an infant is negligently on the street, and her situation at a street corner is apparent, a correspondingly greater degree of 'care was demanded of the defendant to avoid accident than would have been required in the case of an adult. While the prayer as an abstract proposition may be correct,'yet it would be misleading if applied, in the manner offered, to the facts of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">The defendant\u2019s ninth prayer was also properly refused. The law on this point having been stated in the plaintiff\u2019s second prayer, it could not have been granted without such modification as would harmonize the two prayers.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-6\">The first and third hills of exception, which involve the same question, may be discussed together. After the prayers had been offered, the Court announced that certain testimony of one of plaintiff\u2019s witnesses, bearing on the subject of injury and consequent damage, admitted against the objection of the defendant, had been erroneously admitted 'and suggested to defendant\u2019s attorney to move that it be stricken out, but said attorney declining to do so the Court modified the fourth prayer of the plaintiff so as to exclude consideration of the objectionable testimony. After the opening argument of the plaintiff\u2019s counsel to the jury, the Court further modified this fourth prayer, in conformity with a special exception which had been filed thereto by the defendant, and read the prayer as modified to the jury. While it is undoubtedly true that a trial Judge, because of his high and authoritative position, should be exceedingly careful in any remarks made by him during the progress of a trial, either in passing upon evidence or ruling upon prayers, and should carefully refrain, either directly or indirectly, from giving expression to an opinion upon the existence or not of any fact, which should <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>be left to tbe finding of the jury, yet this Court has frequently said that a Judge may at any time during the trial modify his instructions, or revoke them altogether, if convinced of error in a previous ruling. In the present case, though the proceedings were irregular, the modifications were practically at the instance and for the benefit of the defendant, who should not now be heard to complain. <em>Coffin </em>v. <em>Brown, 94 </em>Md. 190; <em>Butler </em>v. <em>Gannon, </em>53 Md. 333; <em>Sittig </em>v. <em>Birkestack, </em>38 Md. 158.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-5\">The judgment of the lower Court will be affirmed with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed with costs.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b261-7\">Wobthington, J., dissented.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
