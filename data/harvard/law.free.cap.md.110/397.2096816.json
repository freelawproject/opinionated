Notwithstanding the fact that the appellant was the lowest responsible bidder, its bid was thrown out for one, and only one, reason. By sec. 9 of the specifications the bidder is required to deposit with his proposal a sample of granite block, stating at what quarry it was manufactured, and agree if the contract is awarded to him, to use only blocks made at said quarry and equal to the sample. The Maryland Pavement Company deposited a sample block which in itself met with the entire approbation of the City Engineer, but the block had no label upon it, stating from what quarry it came.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b426-8\">It can be seen from the whole testimony that the labeling of the sample block submitted by the Maryland Pavement Company, would have brought to the Board of Awards not an iota more information than it had when it acted. In fact, it would not have been at all considered by them had it been there. Mr. Eendall did not need the assurance of a label to become satisfied that the same was an \u201cexcellent\u201d granite, and that it was in fact Woodstock granite. He knew the quality of the stone, and he knew the sample was Woodstock. What is the purpose of stating to him something about a granite block he already knew ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b426-9\">\u25a0 Even upon the strict literal construction contended for by the appellees there is nothing in section 9 that requires the sample block to be labeled. \u201cEach bidder must deposit with his proposal a sample granite block <em>stating </em>at what quarry it was manufactured.\u201d Hnder the clause, no method of stating being specified, the bidder is entitled to convey the informa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>tion in any way he may deem'fit; and if the City Engineer (with whom the samples are deposited), has that knowledge without any statement from the bidder, how useless is the formality for which the appellees contend. In this instance, the City Engineer knows from what run of granite or quarry the sample comes, and is satisfied with it. His duty, as a conscientious official, then should prompt him to recommend this lowest bid and the board\u2019s duty is to accept it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b427-5\">\u201cThe primary duty of the public officers is to secure the most advantageous contract possible for accomplishing the work under their direction.\u201d <em>McQuillan Munic. Ordinances, </em>page 553.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b427-6\">It can be seen from Mr. Fendall\u2019s letter upon which the board acted, that only upon a \u201cstrict interpretation,\u201d can an informality be asserted. But informalities to count for anything must have some substance in them.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b427-7\">\u201cIrregularities or informalities in the submission of bids will not generally invalidate them where there has been a <em>substantial compliance </em>with the provisions of the law or ordinance authorizing such action.\u201d See <em>Abbott Munic.

The whole surroundings, the purposes * * *, the ends to be accomplished, the cqnsequences that may result from one meaning rather than another, and the cardinal rule that seemingly incongruous provisions shall be made to harmonize rather than conflict, must all be considered in determining whether particular words shall have a mandatory or directory effect ascribed to them.\u201d <em>Upshur </em>v. <em>Baltimore, 94 </em>Md. 757.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b428-5\"><em>Abbott (Munic.

The acceptance of the bids for this Monroe street paving and the consequent execution of a contract therefore depend upon section 15, of the Baltimore City charter. That section contains the mandatory provision that the award shall be made to the lowest responsible bidder. Its whole purpose, in establishing free and open competition, is the procurement of a public improvement as cheaply as possible, <em>i. e., </em>at the lowest reasonable cost to the taxpayers. <em>Packard </em>v. <em>Hayes, </em>94 Md. 233, quoted in <em>Baltimore </em>v. <em>Flack, </em>104 Md. 143; <em>Baltimore </em>v. <em>Keyser, </em>72 Md. 111; <em>Anderson </em>v. <em>Fuller, </em>51 Ela. (1906), 390; <em>Abbott, Munic. Corp., </em>sec. 265.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b428-7\">The fulfillment of this purpose is not to be frittered away at the cost \u00f3f the taxpayers, by a strict and narrow and senseless construction of the specification requirements by a party who has no right to pass on them.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b428-8\">\u2022 In judging as to whether the omission is material or not the Court looks to the paramount purpose of the plan under which the bidding was had and then determines whether the omission or irregularity is such as will defeat that purpose.. <em>Saleno </em>v. <em>City of Neosho, </em>127 Mo. 638.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b429-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number><em>Sylvan Hayes Lauchheimer, </em>Deputy City Solicitor, (with whom was <em>Edgar Allan Poe, </em>City Solicitor, ou the brief), for the appellees.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b429-5\">1. The ordinance which provided for the paving of Monroe street states that the specifications shall be prepared by the City Engineer. They were prepared by him and expressly required that each bidder must deposit with his proposal a sample granite blech stating at what quarry it was manufactured and agree if the contract is awarded to him to use only blocks made at said quarry and equal to the sample. The petitioner failed to comply with this provision of the specifications.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b429-6\">It was, therefore, not even entitled to have its bid considered by the Board of Awards. \u201cWhere reasonable requirements have been prescribed as to the manner of bidding, such requirements must be complied with in order that a bid shall be entitled to consideration.\u201d 20 <em>Encyclopedia of Law, </em>pages 1167, 1168; <em>Matter of Marsh, </em>83 N. Y. 431, 435; <em>Weed </em>v. <em>Beach, </em>56 How. Pr. 470, 472; <em>State </em>v. <em>Cincinnati, </em>3 Ohio Dec. 48, 50; <em>People </em>v. <em>Croton, </em>26 Barb. 241, 243, 248; <em>May </em>v. <em>Detroit, </em>2 Mich. N.

The pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>vision being inserted for tbe benefit of the city so that the contractor might be held to the strict performance of his contract and, in ease of default therein, the city would have an easy way of pointing out his failure and insisting upon strict compliance with the contract; especially so, as anterior to the awarding of this contract, belgian blocks had been delivered in Baltimore of which the granite was soft and entirely unfit for paving, it was therefore manifestly proper to insert it, so that the city might be fully protected and be able to see to it that such belgian blocks only were used, which were actually fit for the purpose designed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b430-5\">It might very well happen that in a dispute which could arise between the City Engineer\u2019s Department and the contractor, the possession of a particular block, as a sample, to which the blocks to be fumishe4 \u00ed&gt;y the contractor were to conform would prove to be a very useful precaution. In addition, the testimony of the City Engineer shows that, to some extent, the place from which the blocks are to come indicates the quality of the stone. And, certainly, when a proposed contractor designates the place from which he is to get his stone, he must, to some extent at least, bring to the attention of the City Engineer, the quality of the stone which he is likely to furnish. Even though a sample block might be furnished, the city would not be adequately protected, because if it was a question simply as to the quality of the parieular blocks furnished and a dispute arose, it would be necessary, practically, to take that sample block and compare it with every block offered to be furnished, because the single and only test to be applied as between the parties would be the test as to whether or not the blocks furnished came up to the quality of the particular block furnished as a sample. That fact, of itself, shows that if the City Engineer simply required a sample block to be furnished, whether it was to be furnished from one place or another, notwithstanding that, there 'would be no sufficient guarantee that the contractor, who had agreed to furnish the blocks was furnishing the proper blocks, and, what is by far, most important, there <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>would be uo ready way to settle a dispute, which might arise between the City Engineer on the one side and the contractor on the other. With the statement from, what quarry the blocks are to be furnished, a dispute, if it arose, could be easily settled.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b431-5\">Of course the Board of Awards had the right to waive this provision, but it was under no obligation to do so and unless and until it did so, the petitioner had no right even to have his bid considered. <em>Smith </em>v. <em>City, </em>2 Brewst. (Pa.) 443, 444; <em>Case </em>v. <em>Trenton, </em>68 Atlantic, 58; <em>Gage </em>v. <em>New York, </em>97 N. Y. S. 157, 162.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b431-6\">These considerations make it plain that on this ground alone the Board of Awards was warranted in refusing to award the contract to the petitioner. In addition, the advertisement in this case expressly provided that the Board of Awards reserves the right to reject any and all bids. The petitioner bid, therefore, with fnll knowledge of this reservation and cannot complain. <em>Keogh </em>v. <em>Wilmington, </em>4 Del. Ch. 491, 499.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b431-7\">2. The petition contains the prayer to the Court to issue the writ of mandamus compelling the Board of Awards to award this contract to it, and to accept a duly executed bond and contract, in spite of the fact that the contract had already been awarded to Patrick Elanigan &amp; Sons. <em>There is no allegation or even suggestion of fraud in this case, </em>and that element being absent it becomes evident that the purpose of the petitioner is to have the Court substitute its discretion for the discretion of the Board of Awards, to which the discretion has been committed by the City Charter.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b431-8\">\u25a0 The City Charter (section 15) requires the Board of Awards to open.all bids, and aft\u00e9r opening.them to award the contract to the \u201clowest responsible bidder.\u201d The determination of the question as to who is the lowest responsible bidder \u00a1requires the consideration of questions, other than merely financial ones. The business judgment and capacity, skill, responsibility and reputation of the various bidders are and should be taken into consideration; and in the absence of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>fraud the Court will not interfere with the action of the board to which has been committed the determination of the question who is the' \u201clowest responsible bidder.\u201d 20 <em>Encyclopedia of Law, </em>page 1169; 28 <em>Cyclopedia of Law, </em>page 663; <em>Abbott on Municipal Corporations, </em>pages 603, 604; <em>Kelly </em>v. <em>Chicago, </em>62 Ill. 280; <em>People </em>v. <em>Kent, </em>160 Ill. 655; <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Sanitary District, </em>163 Ill. 285; <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Trenton, </em>60 N.

We are, however, not compelled to rely upon the decisions of other Courts, this very subject has been considered by own Court of Appeals, by which the law of this State has been declared to be that when the letting of a contract has been committed to a board, in the absence of fraud, the determination of the board is absolutely final. <em>Madison </em>v. <em>Harbor Board, </em>76 Md. 395; <em>Devin </em>v. <em>Belt, </em>70 Md. 354; <em>Balto. C. &amp; Pt. R. R.

Although it has been shown that the action of the Court was clearly right in dismissing the petition because of the failure of the petitioner to comply with the specifications, and because of the attempt to substitute the discretion of the Court for that of the Board of Awards; if the petitioner had any rights at all it should have filed a bill to enjoin the doing of the work, to set aside the award and to refer the entire matter back to the Board of Awards. Mandamus was not the proper remedy. <em>Akron </em>v. <em>France, </em>4 Ohio Circuit Rep. 496; <em>Weed </em>v. <em>Beach, </em>56 How.

The Court is asked in this case, notwithstanding the fact that the specifications required a thing to be done and the Board of Awards refused to award the contract for this \u25a0reason, to override the determination of the Board of Awards and not to say that the contract shall not be awarded at all, but that this contract must be awarded to the petitioner, although it has failed to comply with the terms of the specifications. The statement of this proposition furnishes its own answer.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b433-6\">Briscoe, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"A7Y\">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-7\">This appeal is from an order of the Superior Court of Baltimore City refusing a mandamus and dismissing the petitioner\u2019s application therefor. A statement of the facts will be necessary for an understanding of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-8\">By Ordinance Ho. 258 of the Mayor and Oily Council of Baltimore, passed on the 9th day of April, 1907, the City Engineer was authorized and directed to have all that part of Monroe street from the southeast side of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad tracks to the northwest side of Columbia avenue graded and paved with belgian blocks and curbed or re-curbed where necessary with six (6) inch granite, gneiss, armored concrete or other curb, approved by the City Engineer; all of said work was to be done in accordance with specifications to be prepared by the City Engineer, who should advertise for proposals for doing the work.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>On the 4th of March, 1908, Mr. Eendall, the City Engineer, published in the Baltimore Sun the following advertisement calling for proposals:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b434-5\">Department of Public Improvements.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b434-6\">Sub-Department of City Engineer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b434-7\">Baltimore, March 4, 1908.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b434-8\">Separate sealed proposals, addressed to the Board of Awards, care of the City Engineer, will be received by the City Register at his office, City Hall, until 11 A.

Elanigan &amp; Sons. The report of the City Engineer stated they were the lowest bidders who had complied with the specifications.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">While it will be seen that the appellant\u2019s bid was the lowest in amount for the paving, it did not comply with the requirements of the specifications, that each bidder must deposit with his proposal a sample granite block, stating at what quarry it was manufactured and agreeing, if the contract was awarded to it, to use only blocks made at said quarry and equal to the sample.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-6\">The case was heard in the Court below upon petition, answer, traverse and joinder of'issue to the defendant\u2019s answer to the paragraphs of the petition and proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-7\">The Court rejected the prayers on behalf of the petitioner and granted the prayer on behalf of the respondent, to the effect that no evidence has been offered legally sufficient under the pleadings to entitle the petitioner to the writ of mandamus, and that the verdict cf the Court, sitting as a jury, must be for the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-8\">The questions presented for our consideration by the rulings of the Court upon the prayers and necessary for the determination of the case on this appeal practically come to this: (1) Was the failure of the appellant to comply with the specifications and proposals a sufficient reason for the refusal of the appellees to award the contract on the bid presented by it? (2) Is not the letting of contracts by the Board of Awards, like the one in question, to the lowest bidder, in the absence of fraud, absolutely final and. beyond the control of the Courts by mandamus ?</p>\n<p id=\"b435-9\">Mow, in answer to the first inquiry it is only necessary to s\u00e1y that it is a rule of very general application, where reasonable requirements have been prescribed as to the manner of bidding, such requirements must he complied with in order that a bid shall be entitled to consideration. While slight irregularities in a bid not affecting its substantial characteris<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>tics may be disregarded, yet tbe bid may be rejected for such reason and the Court will not interfere in the absence of fraud or collusion. 20 <em>A. &amp; E.

On the contrary, it appears from the testimony of Mr. Eendall, the City Engineer, that this provision in the specifications was not only a reasonable one, but was inserted for the benefit and for the protection of the best interest of the City.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-6\">It is conceded that'the appellant did not comply- with the conditions of the specifications prepared and published by the City Engineer in this respect, and failing to so comply, we are of the opinion it had no right, under the authorities cited, to even have its bid considered by the Board of Awards. 28 <em>Cyc. </em>659; <em>Smith </em>v. <em>City, </em>Brewst. Pa. 443; <em>Case </em>v. <em>Trenton, </em>68 Atlantic, 58.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-7\">But, apart from this, the advertisement in this case by the City Engineer expressly provided that \u201cthe Board of Awards reserves the right to reject any and all bids.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b436-8\">In <em>Chicago Sanitary List. </em>v. <em>McMahon, </em>110 111. App. 510, it is distinctly held that it is not unlawful where the lowest bidder has not conformed to the advertised requirements to let the contract to the next lowest bidder. <em>Lauchheimer </em>v. <em>Phil., </em>15 Pa. Hist. 311; <em>State </em>v. <em>Cincinnati Bd., </em>4 Ohio Cir. Ct. 76.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-9\">While the requirement of a charter that a contract be awarded to the lowest bidder is mandatory, yet the authorities are uniform in holding that in determining who is the lowest responsible bidder the municipal authorities have a wide discretion, will not be controlled by the Courts except for arbitrary exercise, collusion or fraud, and they need not be guided in this determination solely by the question of the pecuniary responsibility of a bidder, but may consider his ability to respond to the requirements of the contract and his general <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>qualifications to properly execute the work. 28 <em>Cyc. </em>1031; <em>Keogh </em>v. <em>Wilmington, </em>4 Del. Ch. 491.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-5\">As to the second proposition hut little need be said. The subject has been frequently considered by this Court, and all the cases hold that when the awarding of a contract like the one here in question has been committed to a board, in the absence of fraud or collusion, its decision is final and conclusive and cannot be controlled by the Courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-6\">The case of <em>Madison </em>v. <em>Harbor </em>Board, 76 Md. 395, is directly in point and is decisive of this case. The better doctrine, however, as to all cases of this nature and one which has the support of an almost uniform current of authority is that the duties of officers entrusted with the letting of contracts for works of public improvements to the lowest bidder are not duties of a strictly ministerial nature, but involve the exercise of such a degree of official discretion as to place them beyond the control of Courts by mandamus. <em>Devin </em>v. <em>Belt, </em>70 Md. 354; <em>Balto. C. &amp; Pt. R. R. Co. </em>v. <em>Latrobe, </em>81 Md. 246; <em>Henkel </em>v. <em>Millard, </em>97 Md. 30; <em>Balto. City </em>v. <em>Flack, </em>104 Md. 143; 28 <em>Cyc. </em>663; 20 <em>Encyclc. of Law, </em>1169.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-7\">There is no allegation or suggestion of fraud in the awarding of the contract in this case, and, without prolonging this opinion by a discussion of well- settled principles of law, we will affirm the order refusing the mandamus and dismissing the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-8\">For the reasons stated there was no error in the rejection of the petitioner\u2019s prayers and in granting the respondents\u2019 prayer that no evidence had been offered legally sufficient under the pleadings to entitle the petitioners to the writ of mandamus.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-9\">\n<em>Order affirmed, with costs.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
