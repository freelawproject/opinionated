It seems that such exceptions were reserved and if the defendants desired to have those exceptions before us they should have been included in the-record of'the former appeal. 1 If for any good reason these exceptions were not ready when the record in that appeal was made up, whereby such exceptions were omitted therefrom,- a writ of diminution, seasonably applied for, would have enabled\u2019the appellees in-that appeal to remedy the defect.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-7\">.As we have said, we did consider all the rulings of the lower Court distinctly presented to us for our consideration, whether embraced in any exception or not, but the method of bringing up- the rulings by formal exceptions is one to be commended, as thereby every point'or question in controversy is officially certified to this Court and clearly defined. But all the exceptions on both sides should have been embraced in one record. Such is the rule, even where cross-appeals are allowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-8\">Rule <em>17 </em>of this Court provides: \u201cIn all cases of cross-appeals or of more than one appeal being entered in the-same case from any judgment; decree or order, there shall be'but one transcript 'of the record transmitted to the-Court of Ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>peals, and. that shall be used-upon-the hearing of all such appeals.\u201d <em>Coate </em>(1904), Art. 5, sec. 42.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">This rule contemplates that there should be but one' transcript of the record and one hearing. In his treatise on <em>Pleading and Practice, Mr. Poe </em>says: \u201cWhere cross-appeals are prayed, the Clerk makes out but one record; and the costs are awarded to the respective parties, or apportioned as the Court of Appeals may deem just.\u201d 2 <em>Poe, PI. and Pr., </em>sec. 833.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">If there could be two transcripts of the record and two hearings at two different terms of this Court we night, on the first appeal reverse the order of the lower Court and then at a subsequent term reverse that reversal without there being any inconsistency in the principles of law announced in the two opinions.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-7\">To obviate any such result,, the ahove-mentiqned rule was no doubt adopted..</p>\n<p id=\"b517-8\">Aside from all this, it is well settled that, a party who is not injured by the final judgment of the trial Court has no right of appeal. 2 <em>Poe\u2019s Practice, </em>sec.. 825. ,</p>\n<p id=\"b517-9\">One requisite of a valid appeal is that the appellant should have been aggrieved by, the judgment, order or decree complained of. 2 <em>Cyc. </em>631; <em>Baylies on New Trials and Appeals </em>(2nd Ed.), p. 134.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-10\">In this case the ordqr of the trial Court dismissing the plaintiffs\u2019 petition with, costs was passed at the defendants\u2019 request, and gave them all they claimed. They could therefore have no standing in this. Court on-an appeal from such an order.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-11\">For these very obvious reasons we think the appeal should be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-12\">We have, however, examined the record and briefs filed in this appeal, and find that very many of the questions thereby presented have been passed upon and determined'by the opinion of this. Court, in the appeal brought here by -the petitioners, and as to other points or questions not directly decided <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>on the other appeal we find no sufficient error to change the result therein declared.</p>\n<p id=\"AtZ\">This appeal must, for the reasons above stated, be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-6\">\n<em>Appeal, dismissed with costs.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
