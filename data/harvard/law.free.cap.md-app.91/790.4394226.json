For the felony murder conviction, appellant was sentenced to life imprisonment with all but thirty years suspended, and for use of a handgun in the commission of a felony, he was sentenced to twenty years imprisonment. Ten years of the latter sentence was ordered to run consecutively to the sentence for murder and ten years was to run concurrently with the murder sentence. This resulted in a total sentence of forty years with the addition of five years of supervised probation upon release.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-12\">The only question presented by appellant is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b818-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"792\">*792</page-number>Did the trial judge err in refusing to suppress a statement made by appellant?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b818-5\">The instant case arises from a murder and robbery which occurred in Prince George\u2019s County on August 4, 1990. This matter came under police investigation on the same date when McGarrette Fowler, a victim of the robbery, directed an investigating police officer to the body of Victor Harris located in a wooded area situated behind a building at 2318 Brightseat Road in Prince George\u2019s County. The victim died from a bullet wound in his chest. The investigating officer testified that \u201clocated at the victim\u2019s right foot was a clear plastic bag containing several rocks of crack cocaine.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b818-6\">Fowler testified that he and the murder victim, Harris, travelled from New York to Prince George\u2019s County to engage in the drug trade. He stated that, when he arrived in Prince George\u2019s County, he contacted Charles Harris as a prospective purchaser of drugs. After a preliminary meeting at which a sample of the merchandise was given to Harris, the prospective purchasers indicated that they would purchase cocaine in the amount of $2500. The parties present at the sale were Fowler, Charles Harris, Victor Harris, and two individuals identified only by their first names, Jay and Mike. Fowler stated that as the money and drugs were exchanged a \u201cshooter ran from behind an abandoned house and yelled, \u2018Freeze,\u2019 and took one shot.\u201d The shot referred to was the one which struck and killed Victor Harris. Fowler proceeded to Charles Harris\u2019 home, dialed 911 and notified the police. The police initiated an investigation which resulted in the issuance of a warrant for appellant\u2019s arrest. On April 7,1990, the warrant was \"in the possession of Sergeant Arthur L. Collins of the Prince George\u2019s County Police Department.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-7\">On that date, appellant's mother brought appellant to Sergeant Collins\u2019 office. Appellant was then seventeen years of age. At 10:00 p.m., Detective Collins began an interview with appellant by advising appellant of his <em>Mi</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"793\">*793</page-number>randa<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> rights. The detective testified that he informed appellant of his rights by reading from a card. The form used contained the sentence, \u201cI am willing to answer questions and I wish to make a statement.\u201d Appellant initialed the statement. In addition, appellant initialed a statement which read, \u201c[N]o promises or inducements have been offered to me by anyone. I have not been threatened or intimidated by anyone, and I have not been forced to make a statement. My decision to make a statement is entirely free and voluntary.\u201d Appellant\u2019s statement, as read into evidence, was as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b819-4\">I was stand [sic] out in the hallway and a girl next door said Spud wants you, so we met up. He said he know, he know two dudes coming down from New York with some drugs. Do you know who had a gun? I said Jay might know, so Jay called Mike. He came with a gun. So Spud came back over and said the deal is ready to go down. The two dudes had already seen Mike and Jay so they needed somebody to stick them up. So everything went okay until he went to go, move, because Spud [said] they had a gun. So I was scared, and then the gun went off. I didn\u2019t mean to do it. I am sorry because I wouldn\u2019t want to dead [sic] over no drugs.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b819-5\">Subsequently, Detective Collins asked questions and typed both the questions and answers. One of those questions was as follows: \u201c[W]hen you went in the woods and began the robbery, what happened?\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b819-6\">Answer: Mike was giving the dude with the drugs the money. The dark-skinned one from New York was taking drugs out of a bag and giving them to Mike. I came up and told everybody to give it up. The one that got shot, he went to move. That\u2019s the one that Spud said had the gun. He went to move and I didn\u2019t know if he was going to reach for it or not and I just shot him. The gun just went off.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b820-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"794\">*794</page-number>Appellant moved to suppress the statement, and a hearing on the motion was conducted a few months prior to the trial. At the hearing, appellant testified as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b820-5\">He (Detective Collins) said, \u2018Don\u2019t make it hard on yourself.\u2019 He was asking me what happened. I said I wasn\u2019t there, and he kept on asking me what happened, and he said he could make it hard and easy for me, and he said, \u2018If you don\u2019t tell me what happened I can get you the electric chair,\u2019 or \u2018You are never going to see your mother again.\u2019 I just broke down and started to make a statement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b820-6\">Detective Collins specifically denied telling appellant that he could get the electric chair and would not see his mother again if he declined to make a statement. The detective said that he made no promises or threats to appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-7\">There was one pertinent admission by Detective Collins. On cross-examination, Detective Collins testified as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b820-8\">Q. You did discuss with him the seriousness of the charges in this case, is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b820-9\">A. No, sir. Not as I recall it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b820-10\">Q. You don\u2019t?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b820-11\">A. The seriousness of it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b820-12\">Q. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b820-13\">A. No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b820-14\">Q. You didn\u2019t advise him the charge was first degree murder?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b820-15\">A. I told him it was murder.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b820-16\">Q. Did you ever tell him that it could be a death penalty offense?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b820-17\">A. Not to my knowledge.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b820-18\">Q. But you could have?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b820-19\">A. I could have.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b820-20\">Appellant\u2019s position is that, since he set forth specific allegations pertaining to threats, the State must set forth \u201ceffective contradictions\u201d constituting an \u201cexpress rebuttal\u201d of the allegations. <em>Lyter v. State, 2 </em>Md.App. 654, 657, 236 A.2d 432 (1968). Appellant further argues that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"795\">*795</page-number>failure to deny affirmatively such assertions is the functional equivalent of an admission. Detective Collins\u2019 acknowledgement that he \u201ccould have\u201d discussed the death penalty with appellant is considered by appellant to be a tacit verification of the alleged threats.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-5\">The State avers that Detective Collins\u2019 acknowledgement that he \u201ccould have\u201d mentioned the death penalty is of no legal consequence where appellant\u2019s testimony demonstrates that his statement was not the product of any such comment. Appellant testified that he made the statement because he was threatened with the electric chair and was told he could never see his mother again. The State argues that appellant did not assert that his statement was induced by the comment that the death penalty was involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-6\">It seems clear, however, from Detective Collins\u2019 detailed testimony, that appellant\u2019s statement was given subsequent to Detective Collins\u2019 remark that the matter was a death penalty case. It logically follows that, having been told the matter was a death penalty case, appellant would understand that he was subject to the death penalty.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-7\">The trial judge realized that, had Detective Collins threatened appellant with the electric chair, the statement was not voluntary. The trial judge, however, found that Detective Collins did not make the statements, pertaining to the electric chair, attributed to him by appellant. In point of fact, the trial judge stated that Detective Collins would not have referred to the electric chair, since the detective was well aware that the mode of execution used in Maryland is administration of lethal gas.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-8\">While the trial judge made no express finding either way with respect to whether Detective Collins told appellant that he faced the death penalty, it is implicit in his dialogue with counsel that he believed the statement was made. After asking appellant\u2019s counsel three times during the argument whether counsel believed that it is improper for the police to tell the defendant that the penalty could be death, the judge said, \u201cI am just wondering if your argu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"796\">*796</page-number>ment is that it is improper for the police to even tell them that the possible penalty for this is death. I don\u2019t see anything wrong with that either, because when you charge someone with murder, I think you are entitled to tell them what the ultimate penalty could be.\u201d It is apparent that the judge decided that the detective\u2019s comment to appellant that this may be a death penalty case was harmless, because the detective was simply commenting upon the maximum penalty available. In so concluding, however, we believe the trial judge erred.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-5\"><em>McIntyre v. State, </em>309 Md. 607, 526 A.2d 30 (1987), instructs that a trial judge, in deciding upon the admissibility of a juvenile\u2019s statement, must consider the totality of the circumstances. As noted earlier, appellant was seventeen years of age at the time of this occurrence. He was without counsel and was separated from his mother who had brought him to the police station. As a juvenile, he was not subject to the death penalty, since Md.Ann.Code art. 27, \u00a7 412(f) provides that a person under the age of eighteen at the time the murder is committed may not be sentenced to death.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-6\">In <em>United States v. Duvall, </em>537 F.2d 15 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>426 U.S. 950, 96 S.Ct. 3173, 49 L.Ed.2d 1188 (1976), the defendant had been arrested and charged with numerous counts of forgery and uttering. After the prosecutor told the defendant that he faced a penalty of 100 years in prison, the defendant gave a statement. Ruling that the statement should have been suppressed, the federal appeals court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b822-7\">Duvall testified that the Assistant U.S. Attorney had told him that the charges carried \u2018a possible sentence of a hundred years.\u2019 The Assistant \u2018couldn\u2019t say\u2019 that he hadn\u2019t. The judge assumed that the Assistant had said what Duvall claimed. The judge was concerned about this since although the remark was correct as a matter of multiplication because of the large number of counts, \u2018it only tells part of the story.\u2019 How small a part is indicated by the fact that, after clear proof of guilt, the judge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"797\">*797</page-number>imposed a prison sentence on only one count. This was for three years, with execution of two years (later changed to two and half years) suspended. [Footnote omitted.] The prosecutor must have known, as the defendant did not, that no judge would impose \u2014 indeed that no prosecutor would seek \u2014 a sentence for the crimes here charged remotely approaching a hundred years, and that a hundred year sentence was not \u2018possible\u2019 in any real sense. Yet a defendant might fear at least that the prosecutor would ask for a very long sentence if he did not \u2018cooperate.\u2019 Such a remark by a prosecutor to an uncounseled defendant from whom he is seeking a waiver of Fifth Amendment rights calls for something more than an expression of judicial concern. The statement to the Assistant U.S. Attorney should have been suppressed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AvB\"><em>Duvall, </em>537 F.2d at 25.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-5\">The case at bar is even more compelling. It is obvious that the threat of a death penalty would be terrifying, particularly to a minor. It is difficult to conceive of any other purpose to Detective Collins\u2019 actions in mentioning a possible death penalty to appellant other than to coerce him into cooperating. <em>See also United States v. Gomez, </em>927 F.2d 1530, 1538 (11th Cir.1991) (\u201c[E]mphasizing to the accused the possible harsh sentences and the benefits of cooperation will likely be interpreted by the accused as pressure to respond and \u2018come clean.\u2019 \u201d); <em>United States v. Toney, </em>579 F.Supp. 652, 657 (S.D.N.Y.), <em>aff'd, United States v. Perez, </em>733 F.2d 1026 (2d Cir.1984) (\u201c[I]t is inappropriate for the prosecution to mention the length of the possible sentence while interviewing an uncounseled defendant in order to induce the defendant\u2019s cooperation____\u201d); <em>People v. Johnson, </em>70 Cal.2d 469, 479, 74 Cal.Rptr. 889, 895, 450 P.2d 265, 271 (1969) (Where police informed a minor that he was accused of first-degree murder, that he faced the gas chamber, and that he should \u201ctell the truth because no one would believe his denial,\u201d the court opined that such exhortations carried \u201cthe implication that by cooperating and telling what actually happened [the defendant] might not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"798\">*798</page-number>accused of or found guilty of first-degree murder (i.e. more lenient treatment by the court or jury)____ It stretches the imagination to believe that [the defendant] knowingly and intelligently waived his right to be free from self-incrimination.\u201d). In <em>McIntyre, </em>309 Md. at 618, 526 A.2d 30 (quoting <em>Miller v. State, </em>251 Md. 362, 378, 247 A.2d 530 (1968)), the Court of Appeals stated, \u201cWe observed that the Supreme Court \u2018has emphasized that admissions of juveniles require special caution.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b824-6\">In <em>Lodowski v. State, </em>307 Md. 233, 254, 513 A.2d 299 (1986), the Court of Appeals quoted the test for voluntariness as articulated in <em>State v. Hill, 2 </em>Md.App. 594, 601-602, 236 A.2d 27 (1967), by Judge Murphy, then Chief Judge of the Court of Special Appeals:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b824-7\">\u2018[T]he constitutional inquiry is not whether the conduct of [the authorities] was shocking, but whether [the accused\u2019s] confession was free and voluntary, <em>viz., </em>whether it was extracted by any sort of threats, or violence, or obtained by any direct or implied promises, however slight, or by the exertion of any improper influence. Otherwise stated, the test of the admissibility of [a] confession is whether [the accused\u2019s] will was overborne at the time he confessed ...; or whether his confession was the product of a rational intellect and a free will <em>...; </em>or whether his statement was \u201cfreely self-determined,\u201d ____ So that ... the question is not whether the accused was frightened, but whether his disclosures to the officers were freely and voluntarily made at a time when he knew and understood what he was saying, (citations omitted)\u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b824-9\">In accordance with <em>Duvall, </em>537 F.2d at 25, incorrectly advising a minor that he may be subject to the death penalty constitutes \u201cimproper influence\u201d to the extent that the minor\u2019s free will is overcome. In light of the circumstances, admission of appellant\u2019s statement could not be found to be harmless error. Accordingly, we must reverse the decision of the circuit court and remand the matter for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"799-821\">*799-821</page-number>JUDGMENT REVERSED.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-5\">CASE REMANDED TO THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR PRINCE GEORGE\u2019S COUNTY FOR A NEW TRIAL.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-6\">COSTS TO BE PAID BY PRINCE GEORGE\u2019S COUNTY.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b819-7\">. <em>Miranda v.
