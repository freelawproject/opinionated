The Orphans\u2019 Court rescinded its October 13, 1987 order, which established appellant as personal representative of his mother\u2019s estate (the late Lucille A. LaGrange), ostensibly because appellant had been convicted of an unnatural or perverted sexual practice (oral sex; see Md.Code Article 27, \u00a7 554). In his stead, the Orphans\u2019 Court, by its order of August 4, 1988, placed Linda Hinton, appellee and daughter of Lucille LaGrange, as successor personal representative.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>Lucille LaGrange passed away on August 22, 1987. She left behind four children, two of whom are parties in the present action. Her will, admitted to probate, listed appellant as personal representative and appellee as successor personal representative. On August 27, 1987, acting upon appellee\u2019s petition for judicial probate, the Orphans\u2019 Court for Anne Arundel County appointed appellee as special administrator contingent upon the filing of proper papers and the posting of a $10,000 bond. The reason for the court\u2019s August 27, 1987 order apparently rested, in part, on appellant\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-5\">Although her brother, Alexander LaGrange, was named as Personal Representative in the Last Will &amp; Testament, he has been convicted and is awaiting sentence for a crime he committed.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-6\">FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b322-7\">Appellant filed a petition for probate on September 21, 1987, listing himself as personal representative. Subsequently, on October 6, 1987, the court conducted a hearing. The court listened to the various testimonies and arguments, and received two exhibits. Shortly thereafter, on October 13, 1987, the court issued its decision, in which it appointed appellant as personal representative of Lucille LaGrange\u2019s estate upon his filing of the proper papers and the posting of a $10,000 bond. Appellant did <em>not </em>post the bond.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-8\">Appellee took an appeal of the court\u2019s October 13th order to the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County. She dismissed that appeal, pursuant to a stipulation between the parties, on June 20, 1988. Two days later, appellant sent a letter to the Orphans\u2019 Court requesting that it grant him \u201cletters of administration.\u201d Much to appellant\u2019s dismay, the court, on August 4, 1988, apparently acting <em>sua sponte, </em>rescinded its previous order of October 13, 1987.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-9\">Appellant\u2019s attorney dispatched a letter to the court, in which he requested the court to vacate its latest order and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>to conduct a hearing as he had previously asked. The letter provides, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-5\">I [Robert S. McNeill, appellant\u2019s counsel] recently received the Court\u2019s August 4, 1988 Order which rescinded the October 13, 1987 Order which appointed Alexander LaGrange as Personal Representative. There was no prior notice to me, nor was any hearing held on the matter, contrary to my request.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-6\">I am now reiterating my request for a hearing on this matter, and am requesting that the August 4,1988 Order be vacated____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b323-7\">Not receiving the hoped for reply and results, appellant filed an appeal with the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County. On appeal, the court granted appellee\u2019s motion for summary judgment, and denied appellant\u2019s cross-motion for the same.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-8\">And the Court concludes, after having heard all the evidence \u2014 all the argument today, that it is a serious crime, and therefore the Court is going to grant the Summary Judgment [motion] of Linda Hinton, deny the Summary Judgment [motion] of Alexander LaGrange, and the Court finds that Linda Hinton should perform the duties of personal representative.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-9\">And it is further Ordered [that] Alexander LaGrange has committed a serious crime, and in accordance with Section 5-105 of the <em>Estates and Trusts Articles </em>[sic] of the Maryland Annotated Code, is not entitled to serve as personal representative. And it\u2019s further Ordered that the Order of the Orphan\u2019s [sic] Court of Anne Arundel County, dated August 4,1988, appointing Linda Hinton as personal representative, is in full force and effect.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AuF\">Before turning to other matters, the court gave appellant some advice.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-10\">I might say that if you don\u2019t agree with the Court\u2019s conclusions, it seems to me you can get yourself a quick hearing up at the Court of Appeals on \u2014 Court of Special <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>Appeals on the stated facts, because you\u2019ve got the facts, you can get an expedited appeal.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">Appellant followed that recommendation, for he comes before us and asks two questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-6\">1. Did the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County err in failing to appoint the Petitioner personal representative of the Estate of Lucille LaGrange because both it and the Orphans\u2019 Court lacked jurisdiction to vacate its October 13, 1987 order appointing the Petitioner personal representative of the Estate of Lucille LaGrange?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-7\">2. Did the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County err in deciding that Petitioner\u2019s conviction under Article 27, Section 554 was a \u201cserious crime\u201d for purposes of Section 5-105(b)(3) of the Estates and Trusts Article, and excluded him from appointment as personal representative of the Estate of Lucille LaGrange?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b324-8\">1.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-9\">Appellant\u2019s jurisdictional argument is unavailing. He argues that the Orphans\u2019 Court lacked jurisdiction to rescind its October 13, 1987 order, in which the court appointed appellant as the personal representative, contingent upon his completion of procedural matters.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He overlooks the point that the status that he sought did not go into effect, for he did not file the necessary bond.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-10\">Appellant is correct to note that appellee \u201ccould not have appealed the Orphans\u2019 Court's October 13, 1987 order a second time on August 4, 1988____\u201d <em>Johnson v. Johnson, </em>265 Md. 327, 331-32, 289 A.2d 318 (1972) <em>(res judicata). </em>Appellee\u2019s appeal, filed October 23, 1987, took the fight from the Orphans\u2019 Court to the Circuit Court. Subsequently, appellee, pursuant to a stipulation, dismissed that appeal. Thus, judicial resolution of issues relating to Lucille <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>LaGrange\u2019s estate was once again in the Orphans\u2019 Court\u2019s domain. Then, on August 4, 1988, the Orphans\u2019 Court rescinded its October 13, 1987 order. The status accorded appellant by the latter order was never perfected because appellant did <em>not </em>file a bond.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">Furthermore, and fatal to his jurisdictional position, is the appeal he took to the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County (filed on September 6, 1988). The Orphans\u2019 Court should have held a hearing before it decided to revoke appellant\u2019s status as personal representative, <em>Schmidt v. Chambers, </em>265 Md. 9, 38, 288 A.2d 356 (1972); <em>Richards v. Richards, </em>27 Md.App. 1, 14, 338 A.2d 377 (1975); however, appellant waived any error by instituting his appeal. The Circuit Court, under the authority of \u00a7 12-502 of the Courts Article, considered the parties\u2019 arguments as if they were raised for the first time. That section provides in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AJV\">(a) <em>In general; exception in Harford and Montgomery counties. </em>\u2014 (1) Instead of a direct appeal to the Court of Special Appeals pursuant to \u00a7 12-501 of this subtitle, a party may appeal to the circuit court for the county from a final judgment of an orphans\u2019 court. The appeal shall be heard de novo by the circuit court. The de novo appeal shall be treated as if it were a new proceeding and as if there had never been a prior hearing or judgment by the orphans\u2019 court. The circuit court shall give judgment according to the equity of the matter.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b325-6\">Thus, appellant triggered the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County\u2019s jurisdiction over Lucille LaGrange\u2019s estate, and the issues arising out of its probate.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-7\">Late last year, the Court of Appeals in <em>Kaouris v. Kaouris, </em>324 Md. 687, 715, 598 A.2d 1193 (1991), discussed the Orphans\u2019 Court\u2019s jurisdictional province and said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A4t\">[W]e hold that a circuit court\u2019s jurisdiction to hear an appeal from an orphans\u2019 court <em>de novo </em>depends upon whether the orphans\u2019 court had jurisdiction over the case in the first place.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b326-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>As discussed <em>supra, </em>the Orphans\u2019 Court had jurisdiction over Lucille LaGrange\u2019s estate. By issuing an order appointing a personal representative, the court implicitly made a determination of jurisdiction. The Orphans\u2019 Court was empowered to settle disputes arising out of the estate\u2019s probate until appellee\u2019s appeal. Once appellee dismissed her appeal, the court\u2019s jurisdiction attached again. Appellant\u2019s present appeal, however, divested that court of jurisdiction, and placed all contentions, <em>de novo, </em>before the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County. \u00a7 12-502 of the Courts Article; <em>Brees v. Cramer, </em>322 Md. 214, 219 n. 2, 586 A.2d 1284 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">Our present duty is limited to a review of the Circuit Court\u2019s granting of appellee\u2019s motion for summary judgment, and its converse ruling on appellant\u2019s cross-motion for summary judgment.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b326-6\">2.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-7\">Appellant begins his barrage with the following sentence.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b326-8\">A conviction under Article 27, Section 554, has absolutely no bearing on the ability to discharge the duties of a personal representative, [and] is therefore not a \u201cserious crime\u201d in that context, and cannot be the basis for exclusion from appointment as personal representative.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b326-9\">For reasons that we will explicate, we conclude that a conviction under Md.Code Article 27, \u00a7 554 fits into the category of \u201cserious crime,\u201d as enumerated in \u00a7 5-105(b)(3) of the Estates and Trusts Article, and can, by itself, disqualify an individual from serving as a personal representative.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-10\">The statute at issue is \u00a7 5 \u2014 105(b)(3) of the Estates and Trusts Article.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>(b) <em>Persons excluded. </em>\u2014 Letters may not be granted to a person who, at the time a determination of priority is made, has filed with the register a declaration in writing that the person renounces the right to administer or is:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-4\">(3) Convicted of a serious crime[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">As appellant notes, no Maryland court has published an opinion interpreting the words \u201cserious crime\u201d as used in \u00a7 5-105(b)(3). Thus, we turn to the statute\u2019s legislative history as an alternative avenue to discern its meaning and intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">In 1968, \u00a7 5-105 would have been found in Md.Code Article 93, \u00a7 59.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-7\">If any person named as executor in a will shall be, at the time when administration ought to be granted, under the age of twenty-one years or of unsound mind, incapable according to law of making a contract <em>or convicted of any crime rendering him infamous according to law, </em>or if any person named as executor shall not be a citizen of the United States, letters testamentary or of administration (as the case may be) may be granted in the same manner as if such person had not been named in the will. (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b327-8\">Senate Bill 316 (1969), in part, repealed \u00a7 59 and, in its place, offered Md.Code \u00a7 5-105(b)(3).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-9\">(b) <em>Exclusions. </em>\u2014 Letters shall not be granted to a person who, at the time any determination of priority is made, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>has filed with the register a declaration in writing that he renounces his right to administer or is</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-5\">(3) Convicted of a serious crime[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b328-6\">The Governor\u2019s Commission to Review and Revise the Testamentary Law of Maryland (Henderson Commission) played a key role in the creation of the \u201cDecedents Estates\u201d title of the Md.Code. The Henderson Commission\u2019s second report contains comments pertaining to \u00a7 5-104. Unfortunately, none of the comments addresses the change of words from \u201cinfamous\u201d to \u201cserious crime.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b328-7\"><em>Garitee v. Bond, </em>102 Md. 379, 62 A. 631 (1905), is the only published Maryland opinion which discusses whether an executor should lose his standing if convicted of an infamous crime. Charles E. Garitee, an attorney, by charging a fee of $12, had violated a federal statute that proscribed taking more than $10 from a pensioner for prosecuting the pensioner\u2019s claim. <em>Garitee, </em>102 Md. at 381-82, 62 A. 631. According to the federal statute, Garitee\u2019s behavior constituted a misdemeanor.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-8\">[A]nd any person who shall violate any of the provisions of this section or who shall wrongfully withhold from a pensioner or claimant the whole or any part of a pension or claim allowed or due such person or claimant under this Act shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor and upon conviction thereof, shall for each and every offense be fined not exceeding $500 or be imprisoned at hard labor not exceeding two years or both in the discretion of the Court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b328-9\">Act of June 27, 1890, ch. 634, \u00a7 4, <em>quoted in, Garitee, </em>102 Md. at 381, 62 A. 631.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-10\">The Orphans\u2019 Court, citing to a statute similar to the pre1969 version of \u00a7 5-104,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> concluded that Garitee had been convicted of an infamous crime, and removed him as executor of the estate in question. <em>Garitee, </em>102 Md. at 382, 62 A. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>631. The Court of Appeals pointed out that federal law labeled a crime infamous based upon its punishment, while Maryland law considered other factors. <em>Garitee, </em>102 Md. at 383, 62 A. 631.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-4\">The authorities generally, though not with entire uniformity, hold that the infamous nature of a crime was determined at common law by the character of the act itself and not by the penalty inflicted for its commission. The crimes which the common law regarded as infamous because of their moral turpitude were treason, felony, perjury, forgery and those other offenses, classified generally as <em>crimen falsi, </em>which impressed upon their perpetrator such a moral taint that to permit him to testify in legal proceedings would injuriously affect the public administration of justice.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">The Court chose to follow Maryland common law, and reversed the Orphans\u2019 Court\u2019s decision. <em>Garitee, </em>102 Md. at 384-85, 62 A. 631.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-6\">Construing therefore as we should the expression \u201cinfamous crime,\u201d used in sec. 51 of Art. 93 of the Code, in the same manner that our predecessors construed it when used in the Constitution, we are compelled to hold that the statutory offense of which the appellant was convicted cannot be regarded by us as an infamous one merely because it was punishable at the discretion of the Court by a term of imprisonment which that Court might, in the exercise of its recognized power, have required him to serve in a penitentiary. Nor do we think that the statutory offense, of which the appellant was convicted, of making an overcharge for services in prosecuting a claim for a pension, and collecting the fee so charged without complying with the provisions of the statute, involved the degree of moral turpitude which would have been requisite to make his transgression an infamous crime at common law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b329-7\">Appellant, quite correctly, states that, currently, a conviction under Md.Code Article 27, \u00a7 554 does not render one infamous. Sodomy (\u00a7 553), \u00a7 554\u2019s companion, is an infa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>mous crime. <em>Kirby v. State, </em>48 Md.App. 205, 207-09, 426 A.2d 423, <em>cert. denied, </em>291 Md. 777 (1981). Both sections appear under the caption \u201cSODOMY.\u201d As Sutherland points out, contextual placement of a code provision is relevant for purposes of statutory interpretation.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-5\">In order to achieve clarity, it is frequently necessary to recast large numbers of sections and rearrange their sequence in order to form a unified and consistent chapter. Thus in the construction of a particular code section, attention should be given to the entire chapter or even the entire code in order to determine the purpose and the objective of the legislature in organizing the material.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A2u\">2A Sutherland Statutory Construction \u00a7 28.11 at 485 (Sands 4th ed. by N.J. Singer 1984). In addition to their proximity, both sections sanction lengthy periods of incarceration.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-6\">\u00a7 553. Sodomy generally.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-7\">Every person convicted of the crime of sodomy shall be sentenced to the penitentiary for not more than ten years.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A9z\">\u00a7 554. Unnatural or perverted sexual practices.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-8\">Every person who is convicted of taking into his or her mouth the sexual organ of any other person or animal, or who shall be convicted of placing his or her sexual organ in the mouth of any other person or animal, or who shall be convicted of committing any other unnatural or perverted sexual practice with any other person or animal, shall be fined not more than one thousand dollars ($1,000.00), or be imprisoned in jail or in the house of correction or in the penitentiary for a period not exceeding ten years, or shall be both fined and imprisoned within the limits above prescribed in the discretion of the court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b330-9\"><em>See also DiBartolomeo v. State, </em>61 Md.App. 302, 307, 486 A.2d 256 (1985). Propinquity and punishment aside, \u00a7 553 and \u00a7 554 share another trait. In <em>Blake v. State, </em>210 Md. 459, 124 A.2d 273 (1956), the Court of Appeals dismissed appellant\u2019s contentions, among several, that there was a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>variance between his indictment and the proof at his trial. The State had charged that appellant committed an unnatural and perverted sexual practice. At trial, the State\u2019s primary witness testified, <em>sans </em>objection, that appellant performed sexual practices upon him, and sodomized him. Appellant admitted the former, but denied the latter.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">The Court affirmed appellant\u2019s conviction, and stated, <em>Blake, </em>210 Md. at 464, 124 A.2d 273:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b331-6\">Assuming, without deciding, that the testimony as to the crime of sodomy is not within the scope of sec. 627 [unnatural and perverted sexual practices], although it is obviously an unnatural and perverted sexual practice, we think it was so closely linked to the crime charged as to fall within the exception noted, under the circumstances of this case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b331-7\">The three traits that \u00a7 554 shares with \u00a7 553, are strong enough, in our opinion, to render infamous a person convicted under \u00a7 554.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-8\">We are aware that \u00a7 554 does not apply to consensual, noncommercial, heterosexual activity between adults in the privacy of the home. <em>Schochet v. State, </em>320 Md. 714, 731-32, 734, 580 A.2d 176 (1990). Activity falling outside of this protected zone is punishable. <em>Neville v. State, </em>290 Md. 364, 430 A.2d 570 (1981); <em>Gooch v. State, </em>34 Md.App. 331, 367 A.2d 90 (1976), <em>cert. denied, </em>280 Md. 735 (1977). Appellant\u2019s conviction attests to that.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-9\">Equating infamous crimes to serious crimes is not the only method of interpretation available to us. The definition section of Md.Code Article 27A (Public Defender), \u00a7 2 provides us with some insight.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b331-10\">(a) For the purposes of this article, the following terms shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>(h) \u201cSerious crime\u201d means:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-5\">(1) A felony;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-6\">(2) A misdemeanor or offense, the penalty for which involves the possibility of confinement for more than three months or a fine of more than $500, or any other offense where, in the opinion of the court, either the complexity of the matter, or the youth, inexperience, or mental capacity of the accused, may require representation of the accused by an attorney; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-7\">(3) An act that, except for the age of the person involved, would otherwise be a serious crime.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b332-8\">Under \u00a7 2(h)(2), appellant\u2019s conviction would qualify as a serious crime and he would be entitled to the public defender\u2019s services.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-9\">Another area which is relevant in resolving the present dilemma is the jury trial guarantee of the United States Constitution (sixth amendment) and Maryland\u2019s Declaration of Rights (article 5). In <em>Cabana v. Bullock, </em>474 U.S. 376, 384, 106 S.Ct. 689, 696, 88 L.Ed.2d 704 (1986), the Supreme Court reiterated that \u201c[a] defendant charged with a serious crime has the right to have a jury determine his guilt or innocence____\u201d A crime takes on the label \u201cserious\u201d or \u201cpetty\u201d based upon the length of the concomitant sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"Akd\">In <em>Codispoti v. Pennsylvania, </em>418 U.S. 506, 512, 94 S.Ct. 2687, 2691, 41 L.Ed.2d 912 (1974), the Supreme Court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AvR\">[Ojur decisions have established a fixed dividing line between petty and serious offenses: those crimes carrying a sentence of more than six months are serious crimes and those carrying a sentence of six months or less are petty crimes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b332-12\">In Maryland, the right to a jury trial attaches if the offense charged is infamous <em>or </em>if the punishment is infamous (and to offenses which have traditionally been tried before juries). <em>Kawamura v. State, </em>299 Md. 276, 291, 473 A.2d 438 (1984). The Court of Appeals, in <em>Danner v. State, </em>89 Md. 220, 226, 42 A. 965 (1899), reasoned that appellant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>was entitled to a jury trial because his punishment was infamous.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-4\">The right to demand a jury trial, being as we have thus seen guaranteed only to such crimes and accusations as have by the regular course of the law and established mode of procedure as therefore practised, it becomes necessary to inquire as to what class of offences entitle the party to its enjoyment. It is clear that it cannot be demanded in many minor offences. These could always be reached in summary proceedings. [B]ut it is difficult to define with precision the class of cases that could be so tried. It may, however, be stated as a general rule that for any criminal offence [sic] for which a person is liable to infamous punishment, a trial by jury cannot be denied him. It cannot be questioned that confinement in the penitentiary is an infamous punishment. (Citations omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">Appellant\u2019s position must give way to the weight of authority to the contrary. If we were to adopt appellant\u2019s view, we would create an anomaly: theoretically, appellant would be able to argue that he is entitled to a jury trial and the public defender\u2019s good offices, yet, <em>at the same time, </em>maintain that his conviction should not disqualify him from serving as a personal representative. We choose not to travel down that path.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-6\">Therefore, we hold that the trial court did not err when it granted appellee\u2019s motion for summary judgment and denied appellant\u2019s cross-motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-7\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED; APPELLANT TO PAY THE COSTS.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b324-13\">.

The crux of \u00a7 5-105(b)(3) has long been a part of Maryland law. For example, in 1905, Md.Code Art. 93, \u00a7 51, read almost identical to Md.Code Article 93, \u00a7 59. The older provision, <em>quoted in Garitee v.
