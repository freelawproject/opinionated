Since the allegations in the employee\u2019s complaint do not demonstrate that she was discharged in \u201cviolation of a clear mandate of the public policy of this State,\u201d <em>Adler v. American Standard Corp., </em>291 Md. 31, 44, 432 A.2d 464 (1981), we affirm the order of the Circuit Court for Montgomery County (Miller, J.) dismissing the complaint for failure to state a claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-6\">(i)</p>\n<p id=\"b829-7\">Appellant, Won Gee Lee (\u201cLee\u201d), was employed as an at will employee, a systems test engineer, by appellee, Denro, Inc. (\u201cDenro\u201d), from August 28, 1978 until April 23, 1990. Denro specializes in the development, manufacture, and service of electronic systems communications equipment; among the chief customers of Denro\u2019s testing equipment is the FAA. Lee\u2019s responsibilities included testing and trouble shooting in Denro\u2019s systems testing department. According to her complaint, Lee was \u201cconscientious in the performance of her duties,\u201d and always followed prescribed \u201ctesting procedures.\u201d From time to time, Lee brought deviations from these procedures by other employees to their attention, or to the attention of her supervisors. (While Lee uses these terms throughout the complaint, she does not describe the \u201ctesting procedures,\u201d nor does she describe in what ways the \u201ctesting procedures\u201d were \u201cdeviated from.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b829-8\">On April 20, 1990, Lee was assigned to work with Hai Tran (\u201cTran\u201d), another Denro employee, to perform the final two tests on a communications system designed for use by air traffic controllers. Lee alleges that she \u201cdid not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"826\">*826</page-number>have a good opinion of Tran\u2019s work.\u201d She further alleges that on unspecified earlier occasions, she was working with Tran \u201cwhen he deviated from a prescribed procedure.\u201d On one occasion, an FAA inspector was present and Lee pointed out the alleged deviation from procedure in front of the inspector who, according to the complaint, agreed with her.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-5\">On April 20, Tran was to have the lead responsibility in conducting the remaining two tests and Lee was assigned to assist Tran by recording data as he performed the tests. Lee \u201cnoted that [Tran] sometimes was not following the testing procedures prescribed in Denro manuals. He seemed not to know what he was doing, and to be guessing without consulting the manuals.\u201d When the director of the manufacturing department, Jeff Clute, came into the testing area, Lee brought Tran\u2019s alleged departure from procedures to his attention and asked to be transferred to another assignment. Clute denied her request for transfer, and told her \u201cto take up her problem with her immediate supervisor.\u201d Clute also told her that the testing assignment on which Tran and Lee were working had to be \u201cfinished as soon as possible.\u201d Lee does not allege that she subsequently asked her immediate supervisor for a transfer.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-6\">Rather, she simply alleges that an accelerated test schedule was then implemented, requiring that she work the next day, Saturday, April 21, 1990, with Tran. According to the complaint, Lee and Tran \u201cwere to demonstrate to the FAA inspector compliance with the remaining two tests.\u201d Prior to the demonstration, Lee alleges that she smelled \u201cthe resistor burning in the JAX channel\u201d and that she knew \u201cthis meant that Tran had put a jumper in the wrong place.\u201d Lee asserts that Tran was aware of his mistake and said to her, \u201cin substance, \u2018Shut your mouth! Don\u2019t tell the boss! Don\u2019t tell the inspector! Don\u2019t tell the FAA!\u2019 \u201d She further alleges that Tran asked her to replace the burned resistor and she refused. Tran then made the adjustment of the jumper and replaced the resistor. Only after these adjustments were made, according to Lee\u2019s complaint, did the FAA inspector come to the testing area. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"827\">*827</page-number>The demonstration was then performed successfully, and the system passed the next-to-last test. One more test remained, which, due to an unanticipated system failure, could not be performed that day.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-5\">On the following Monday, April 23, 1990, Denro gave Lee a letter advising her that she was terminated, effective immediately, because:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b831-6\">... You jeopardized the completion and results of a factory acceptance test of one of Denro\u2019s FAA systems when you disputed the company\u2019s test procedures. You did this in the presence of the customer (FAA representative). His concern prompted further investigation which revealed that on the preceding day you had been informed by Jeff Clute that testing had to go on as scheduled. Your actions constitute[d] gross misconduct and cannot be accepted.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b831-7\">In addition, Lee alleges that \u201c[o]n information and belief,\u201d as a result of alleged, unspecified difficulties \u201cin meeting FAA safety standards ... [t]he FAA\u2019s level of confidence in quality assurance and control at Denro was below expected levels.\u201d She asserts that \u201c[w]hen the FAA first assigned resident inspectors to the Denro facility\u201d her immediate supervisor instructed his subordinates \u201cto bring their problems to him\u201d and that \u201cin context\u201d this meant the supervisor \u201cwas clearly implying that employees were not to discuss any safety concerns with FAA inspectors.\u201d Lee further asserts that her supervisor\u2019s directive to bring problems to him reflects Denro\u2019s alleged policy of \u201cprohibiting its employees from raising safety concerns with the FAA, particularly FAA resident inspectors.\u201d She does not assert any pattern of stifling conduct by Denro. Finally, Lee alleges that Denro\u2019s termination of her employment contravened \u201ca clear mandate of United States public policy: <em>promotion of maximum achievable safety in air transportation </em>\u201d (emphasis in original). Specifically, she asserts that \u201cDenro\u2019s conduct, as alleged herein\u201d violated two federal criminal statutes, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1001 and 1505.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"828\">*828</page-number>The circuit court found the facts alleged by Lee to be insufficient to state a cause of action for wrongful termination in accordance with the principles set forth by the Court of Appeals in <em>Adler v. American Standard Corporation, </em>supra. The court below held, \u201cThis is an internal dispute [between] the employer and employee. Given that fact, the Court is of the opinion that Counts 1 and 2 fail to state a cause of action.\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b832-5\">Because Lee\u2019s suit against Denro was disposed of on a motion to dismiss, we must assume the truth of all well-pleaded facts in her complaint, as well as inferences which may reasonably be drawn from those well-pleaded facts. <em>Wimmer v. Richards, </em>75 Md.App. 102, 105, 540 A.2d 827 (1988); <em>see also Flaherty v. Weinberg, </em>303 Md. 116, 136, 492 A.2d 618 (1985). If any material facts alleged in Lee\u2019s complaint tend to support her right to recover, the order to dismiss must be reversed; we limit our consideration, however, to allegations of fact and the inferences deducible from them, and not \u201cmerely conclusory charges.\u201d <em>Parker v. The Columbia Bank, </em>91 Md.App. 346, 604 A.2d 521 (1992); <em>Yousef v. Trustbank, </em>81 Md.App. 527, 536, 568 A.2d 1134 (1990) <em>(quoting Berman v. Karvounis, </em>308 Md. 259, 265, 518 A.2d 726 (1987)).</p>\n<p id=\"b832-6\">(ii)</p>\n<p id=\"b832-7\">This case presents the \u201cfamiliar common-law problem of deciding where and how to draw the line between claims that genuinely involve the mandates of public policy and are actionable, and ordinary disputes between employee and employer that are not.\u201d <em>Sheets v. Teddy\u2019s Frosted Foods, Inc., </em>179 Conn. 471, 427 A.2d 385, 387 (1980). Prior to <em>Adler, </em>Maryland strictly adhered to the general common <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"829\">*829</page-number>law rule that, absent a statutory or contractual obligation to the contrary, either an employer or an employee may terminate the employment relationship for any or no reason. <em>See, e.g., State Comm \u2019n on Human Rel. v. Amecom Div., </em>278 Md. 120, 126, 360 A.2d 1 (1976). In <em>Adler, </em>the Court of Appeals recognized, for the first time, a \u201cnarrow exception\u201d to this rule, holding that an employee who has been \u201cdischarged in a manner that contravenes public policy\u201d may \u201cmaintain a cause of action for abusive or wrongful discharge against his former employer.\u201d 291 Md. at 36-37, 432 A.2d 464. Maryland thus joined a growing number of states which have adopted a \u201cpublic policy exception\u201d to ordinary notions of at will employment. <em>See generally, </em>Comment, <em>Protecting Employees At Will Against Wrongful Discharge: The Public Policy Exception, </em>96 Harv. L.Rev.1931 (1983). <em>See also Adler, supra, </em>291 Md. at 36, 432 A.2d 464 (discussing general approaches to abusive discharge tort).</p>\n<p id=\"b833-4\">When recognizing a public policy exception to the general rule governing at will employment, Maryland also confronted, as other states have, the difficulty in identifying what constitutes a \u201cpublic policy,\u201d the violation of which amounts to a cause of action against an employer by the discharged employee. <em>See Prince v. Rescorp Realty, </em>940 F.2d 1104, 1107 (7th Cir.1991) (\u201cDetermining what is clearly mandated public policy is difficult; indeed, the concept \u2018has been called the Achilles heel of the principle underlying the tort of retaliatory discharge\u2019 \u201d <em>(quoting Hicks v. Resolution Trust Corp., </em>736 F.Supp. 812, 815 (N.D.Ill.1990)). Generally, \u201cpublic policy\u201d has been defined as \u201cthat principle of law which holds that no one can lawfully do that which tends to be injurious to the public or against the public good.\u201d <em>Boyle v. Vista Eyewear, Inc., </em>700 S.W.2d 859, 871 (Mo.App.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b833-5\">In attempting to be more specific, the <em>Adler </em>court acknowledged that \u201c \u2018jurists to this day have been unable to fashion a truly workable definition of public policy,\u2019 \u201d 291 Md. at 45, 432 A.2d 464 <em>(quoting Md.-Nat\u2019l Cap. P. &amp; P. v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"830\">*830</page-number><em>Wash. Nat'l Arena, </em>282 Md. 588, 605-606, 386 A.2d 1216 (1978)). It then identified \u201clegislative enactments, prior judicial decisions, [and] administrative regulations\u201d as the chief sources of public policy. 291 Md. at 45, 432 A.2d 464. The <em>Adler </em>court further cautioned that, while courts considering claims of abusive discharge are not confined to these sources, \u201crecognition of an otherwise undeclared public policy as a basis for a judicial decision involves the application of a very nebulous concept to the facts of the case,\u201d a practice which should be employed sparingly, if at all. <em>Id. </em>In subsequent <em>Adler </em>litigation, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit added, \u201cLimitation of the claim for abusive discharge to situations involving the actual refusal to engage in illegal activity, or the intention to fulfill a statutorily prescribed duty, ties abusive discharge claims down to a manageable and clear standard.\u201d <em>Adler v. American Standard Corp., </em>830 F.2d 1303, 1307 (4th Cir.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b834-4\">Moreover, although Maryland appellate courts have decided several cases involving abusive discharge claims since <em>Adler, </em>they have never found such a claim to be stated absent a discharge which violates a public policy set forth in the constitution, a statute, or the common law. <em>See, e.g., Ewing v. Koppers, </em>312 Md. 45, 537 A.2d 1173 (1988) (discharge of employee who exercises rights under state worker\u2019s compensation <em>statute </em>can result in abusive discharge claim); <em>Kessler v. Equity Management, Inc., </em>82 Md.App. 577, 572 A.2d 1144 (1990) (manager discharged for refusal to commit <em>common law </em>trespass and violate tenant\u2019s <em>constitutional </em>right to privacy can bring abusive discharge claim); <em>Moniodis v. Cook, </em>64 Md.App. 1, 494 A.2d 212, <em>cert. denied, </em>304 Md. 631, 500 A.2d 649 (1985) (employee discharged in violation of <em>state statute </em>for refusal to take lie detector test can bring abusive discharge claim).</p>\n<p id=\"b834-5\">(iii)</p>\n<p id=\"b834-6\">Here, Lee asserts that Denro\u2019s discharge of her violated a \u201cclear mandate of United States public policy: <em>promotion </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"831\">*831</page-number><em>of maximum achievable safety in air transportation\u201d </em>(emphasis in original), as evidenced by the alleged fact that Denro\u2019s \u201cconduct\u201d violated two federal criminal statutes, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001 and \u00a7 1505.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b835-5\">Section 1001 makes it a federal felony to knowingly and willfully \u201cconceal or cover up by trick, scheme or device a material fact\u201d or to make any \u201cfalse, fictitious or fraudulent statements or misrepresentations\u201d in any matter \u201cwithin the jurisdiction of any ... agency of the United States\u201d. Section 1505 states, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b835-6\">Whoever corruptly ... or by any threatening letter or communication influences, obstructs, or impedes or endeavors to influence, obstruct or impede the due and proper administration of the law under which any pending proceeding is being had before any ... agency of the United States ... shall be fined.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b835-7\">Accepting as true the averments in Won Lee\u2019s complaint, they, like those in Adler\u2019s complaint, are \u201ctoo general, too conclusory, too vague and lacking in specifics to amount up to a prima facie showing,\u201d <em>Adler, </em>291 Md. at 44, 432 A.2d 464, that Denro\u2019s claimed misconduct violated either of these statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-8\">The purpose of \u00a7 1001 is to protect the United States Government from fraud or deceit. <em>United States v. Fern, </em>696 F.2d 1269, 1273 (11th Cir.1983). In order to be convicted under \u00a7 1001, a defendant must be shown to have (1) made a statement or representation that was (2) false, (3) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"832\">*832</page-number>material, (4) made knowingly and willfully, and (5) made in a matter within the jurisdiction of a federal agency. <em>See United States v. Notarantonio, </em>758 F.2d 777, 785 (1st Cir.1985). Lee does not allege that Denro made any false statement, let alone a material or willful one. Nor does she allege that Denro discharged her because she refused to make a false statement. In short, the complaint does not begin to set forth the allegations necessary to demonstrate that Denro\u2019s \u201cconduct violated \u00a7 1001.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"A8l\">Similarly, Lee\u2019s allegations do not set forth any basis for concluding that Denro\u2019s conduct violated 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1505. That statute, the federal \u201cobstruction of justice\u201d statute, prohibits the influencing, obstructing or impeding \u201cby any threatening letter or communication\u201d of a witness in a proceeding pending before a department or agency of the United States. Lee does not allege <em>how </em>Denro affirmatively attempted to silence her or persuade her to lie to the FAA inspector or even that Denro did this. Moreover, the role of the FAA inspector, as described in Lee\u2019s complaint, does not involve an investigative or adjudicatory matter on a level necessitated under the caselaw to be considered a \u201cproceeding\u201d for the purposes of \u00a7 1505. <em>See United States v. Browning, </em>572 F.2d 720, 723 (10th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>439 U.S. 822, 99 S.Ct. 88, 58 L.Ed.2d 114 (1978) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"833\">*833</page-number>(\u201cproceeding\u201d generally applies to investigation prior to a trial or to adjudicative functions of a department or agency); <em>United States v. Vixie, </em>532 F.2d 1277, 1278 (9th Cir.1976) (Internal Revenue Service investigation, in which a subpoena was issued to the defendant, is a \u201cproceeding\u201d with the meaning of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1505).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b837-4\">While Lee may personally believe that she was placed in a situation in which she was expected to commit a fraud, she has set forth no tangible basis on which we might draw that legal conclusion. Courts have refused to find that at will employees fired under such circumstances have been discharged in violation of public policy. <em>See Adams v. Budd, </em>583 F.Supp. 711, 716 (E.D.Pa.1984) (no cause of action where employee does not identify specific hazards or injuries caused by employer\u2019s practices); <em>Pierce v. Ortho Pharmaceutical Corp., </em>84 N.J. 58, 417 A.2d 505, 512 (1980) (employee should not have the right to prevent employer from pursuing its business because the employee perceives that a particular business decision violates the employee\u2019s personal morals, as distinguished from a recognized statement or code of public policy). <em>See also Bard v. Bath Iron Works Corp., </em>590 A.2d 152, 154 (Me.1991) (allegation of employer\u2019s violation of government contract did not constitute allegation of violation of federal law).</p>\n<p id=\"b837-5\">\u2019 (iv)</p>\n<p id=\"b837-6\">Like the circuit court, our examination of Lee\u2019s complaint leads us to conclude that she has alleged nothing more than a normal employer-employee dispute. When a plaintiff fails to demonstrate that his or her grievance is anything more than a private dispute regarding the employer\u2019s execution of normal management operating procedures, there is no cause of action for abusive discharge.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"834\">*834</page-number>For example, in <em>Geary v. United States Steel Corp., </em>456 Pa. 171, 319 A.2d 174 (1974), the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania found that a salesperson, who alleged that he was fired after he voiced his belief to management that the product he was selling had not been adequately tested and was unsafe, had not stated a cause of action for abusive discharge. After considering the employee\u2019s allegations, the court held that \u201cthere is nothing here from which we could infer that the company fired [the plaintiff] for the specific purpose of causing him harm, or coercing him to break any law or otherwise to compromise himself.\u201d <em>Id., </em>319 A.2d at 178. Specifically, the court found that the plaintiff\u2019s allegations that he \u201cvigorously expressed his own point of view in the matter, by-passing his immediate supervisors and taking his case to a company vice-president,\u201d resulting in his ultimate dismissal, were insufficient to state a cause of action. <em>Id. </em>\u201cThe most natural inference from the chain of events recited in the complaint is that [the plaintiff] had made a nuisance of himself, and the company discharged him to preserve administrative order in its own house,\u201d the court said. <em>Id. Accord, Willcutts v. Galesburg Clinic Ass\u2019n, </em>201 Ill.App.3d 847, 147 Ill.Dec. 853, 856-57, 560 N.E.2d 1, 4-5 (1990) (physician expelled from medical clinic association after he filed suit against association for, inter alia, fraud and antitrust violations, failed to state a cause of action for abusive discharge, because he failed to demonstrate that his personal grievance was \u201canything more than a private dispute amongst coworkers\u201d). In <em>Geary, </em>the Pennsylvania Supreme Court expressly noted that disruptive employee conduct does not qualify for special protection simply because it is borne of good intentions. 319 A.2d at 179. <em>See also Mudd v. Hoffman Homes for Youth, Inc., </em>374 Pa.Super. 522, 543 A.2d 1092, 1095 (1988) (\u201cThe praiseworthiness of (appellant\u2019s) motive does not detract from [the employer\u2019s] legitimate interest in preserving its normal operational procedures from disruption\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b838-5\">A number of other courts have also concluded that an employee who is dismissed for raising objections to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"835\">*835</page-number>employer\u2019s business, management or safety practices, even if correct in his or her allegations, does not state a cause of action for abusive discharge. <em>See, e.g., Percival v. General Motors Corp., </em>400 F.Supp. 1322, 1324 (E.D.Mo.1975), <em>aff'd, </em>539 F.2d 1126 (8th Cir.1976) (no abusive discharge where employee was fired in retaliation for his attempt to correct false impressions given by the corporation to outside business associates and to urge corporate management itself to correct misleading information conveyed to public, because no clear mandate of public policy was involved); <em>Hibbert v. Centennial Villas, Inc., </em>56 Wash.App. 889, 786 P.2d 309, 311 (1990) (where employer articulated legitimate reasons for terminating nursing home employee, the employee had the burden of showing those reasons were a mere pretext; fact that employee had reported malfunctioning doors and the presence of foreign object in patient\u2019s medicine insufficient to meet burden); <em>Crockett v. Mid-America Health Services, </em>780 S.W.2d 656 (Mo.App.1989) (nursing supervisor at psychiatric hospital fired after she reported defects in hospital\u2019s operations to inspectors did not state claim for abusive discharge, where she was not actually directed to misrepresent status of operations). Thus, where, as here, there is no affirmative direction by an employer that an employee violate a recognized public policy and the employee contravenes normal operating procedures in airing his or her grievances, an employer is free to discharge that employee at will.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b840-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"836\">*836</page-number>Moreover, the fact that the employer does not have a good reason for the employee\u2019s discharge does not, in the absence of a clear violation of public policy, render the discharge \u201cabusive\u201d or \u201cwrongful.\u201d For example, in <em>Per-cell v. International Business Machines, Inc., </em>765 F.Supp. 297 (E.D.N.C.1991), an employee complained, <em>inter alia, </em>that he was discharged because he exercised his right under the company\u2019s \u201copen door policy\u201d which permitted all employees to appeal the decisions of immediate supervisors to higher level management. The employee alleged that, after he appealed his supervisor\u2019s refusal to transfer him to a different work location, he was fired in retaliation for exercising his rights. The federal district court found that, even if the employee had been discharged for the reason alleged, he failed to state a cause of action for abusive discharge. \u201c[T]he question of how defendant handled appeals of management decisions is not a matter which implicates general public policy concerns and is instead largely a matter of interest only to the private parties involved,\u201d the court said. <em>Id. </em>at 300. <em>See also Connolly v. Harry Macklowe Real Estate Co., </em>161 A.D.2d 520, 555 N.Y.S.2d 790, 792 (1990) (no cause of action stated where pleading failed to describe how the bad temper and erratic behavior of building manager amounted to conduct which is contrary to law, rule, or regulation, thus jeopardizing the health and safety of the public); <em>McLaughlin v. Barclays American Corp., </em>95 N.C.App. 301, 382 S.E.2d 836, 839 <em>cert. denied, </em>325 N.C. 546, 385 S.E.2d 498 (1989) (even if employer\u2019s decision to discharge employee after he defended himself in physical altercation with another employee was \u201cirrational,\u201d it did not violate public policy; suggestion that \u201cpublic policy favors encouraging employees to defend themselves\u201d was insufficient basis on which to allege abusive discharge).</p>\n<p id=\"b840-5\">A case in which an employee successfully stated a cause of action for abusive discharge illustrates the particular deficiencies in Lee's complaint. In <em>Sheets v. Teddy\u2019s Frosted Foods, Inc., supra, </em>the Supreme Court of Connecticut found that an employee stated a claim of abusive discharge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"837\">*837</page-number>against his employer, a producer of frozen food products, because: (a) the employee, a quality control director, identified specific deviations in the employer\u2019s product from specifications contained in the employer\u2019s standards and labels, which concerned the use of substandard raw materials and underweight components in the employer\u2019s finished products; (b) false and misleading labels constituted a violation of a specific provision within the Connecticut Uniform Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act; (c) the employee notified his employer in writing as to these problems; and (d) the employee\u2019s recommendations were ignored, and subsequent to his reporting the product\u2019s deviations from the employer\u2019s labels, the employee was discharged. 427 A.2d at 386. Here, unlike the employee in <em>Sheets, </em>Lee did not allege any specific \u201cdeviations\u201d from Denro\u2019s testing procedures. Lee did not allege how the alleged general \u201cdeviations\u201d departed from the amorphous policy concern of \u201cmaximum achievable safety in air transportation.\u201d Lee did not allege that she articulated her concerns in writing or to her supervisor, as she acknowledges she was expressly directed to do; rather, what protesting she did was done randomly to whomever would listen. Finally, Lee does not even allege that her random objections were ignored.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-5\">Lee has not stated a cause of action for abusive discharge; the circuit court correctly dismissed her complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-6\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-7\">COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLANT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b832-8\">. In her complaint Lee also alleged that Denro\u2019s discharge of her constituted age discrimination (Count III) and sex discrimination (Count IV). The circuit court gave her the opportunity to amend those counts; she declined to do so. On appeal she has abandoned them, noting that this appeal \u201cfocuses exclusively on the court\u2019s dismissal of the abusive discharge counts of the complaint.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b835-9\">. We assume without deciding that an employee can base a claim for wrongful discharge under Maryland law on an asserted violation of public policy exhibited by violation of federal statutes. <em>See Phipps v. Clark Oil &amp; Refining Corp., </em>396 N.W.2d 588 (Minn.App.) <em>aff'd, </em>408 N.W.2d 569 (Minn.1987) (employee alleging that he was discharged for refusal to violate the federal Clean Air Act by pumping leaded gasoline stated a cause of action against employer for wrongful termination); <em>Boyle v. Vista Eyewear, Inc., </em>700 S.W.2d 859 (Mo.App.1985) (cause of action stated where employee alleged that she was dismissed in retaliation for filing complaints with United States Occupational Safety and Health Administration and Federal Drug Administration).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b836-5\">. Although \u00a7 1001 has been interpreted broadly and has served as the basis for conviction in a wide variety of circumstances, it has never been applied absent a misrepresentation. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Oren, </em>893 F.2d 1057 (9th Cir.1990) (defendant told National Park Service that he had another offer on property which NPS sought to purchase through non-profit third-party organization, when he in fact had no such offer); <em>United States v. Alemany Rivera, </em>781 F.2d 229, 235-36 (1st Cir.1985) (hospital administrator convicted for submitting falsified documentation capable of resulting in fraudulent procurement of Department of Housing and Urban Development funds); <em>United States v. Chandler, </em>752 F.2d 1148, 1151-52 (6th Cir.1985) (false documents submitted to Internal Revenue Service); <em>United States v. Carrier, </em>654 F.2d 559, 561 (9th Cir.1981) (defendant lied to customs officer about amount of money he was carrying over border); <em>United States v. Wolf, </em>645 F.2d 23, 25 (10th Cir.1981) (defendant, a distributor of oil and related products, misrepresented grade of oil on certificate required under federal regulation).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b837-7\">. Denro does not claim that federal law provides an exclusive remedy precluding a state law abusive discharge claim. <em>Compare Chappell v. Southern Md. Hosp., Inc., </em>320 Md. 483, 578 A.2d 766 (1990). <em>See also Meaige v. Hartley Marine Corp., </em>925 F.2d 700, 702 (4th Cir.1991).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b839-5\">. In dismissing Lee\u2019s claim, the trial court stated, \"this isn\u2019t a whistle-blowing case where somebody has reported, well they are making unsafe airplanes that will \u2014 and to report to the FAA or something.\u201d The court\u2019s suggestion that, in order to state a cause of action in abusive discharge, Lee must have complained directly to FAA safety authorities about a violation in safety standards, may be erroneous. The existence of public policy would not seem to depend on whether an employee articulates her grievances to government authorities. <em>See Wheeler v. Caterpillar Tractor Co., </em>108 Ill.2d 502, 92 Ill.Dec. 561, 565, 485 N.E.2d 372, 376 (1985), <em>cert. denied, </em>475 U.S. 1122, 106 S.Ct. 1641, 90 L.Ed.2d 187 (1986); <em>Petrik v.
