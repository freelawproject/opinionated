He presents the following issues for our review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b346-5\">1. Whether the trial court erred in finding that the appellant\u2019s discovery motions were violative of the court\u2019s Protective Order and in awarding sanctions against the appellant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b346-6\">2. Whether the trial court abused its discretion in ruling that the appellant violated Maryland Rule 1-341 and in awarding attorney\u2019s fees, as a matter of law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b346-7\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b346-8\">The defendant (Husband) retained the appellant as his attorney in a contested divorce proceeding. The underlying divorce proceedings had been at issue for approximately fifteen months before the appellant entered his appearance on behalf of the Husband. The plaintiff (Wife) had filed simultaneously a complaint for divorce and a Petition for Protective Order alleging fraud, bigamy, alcohol and drug abuse on the part of Husband, and seeking a Use and Possession Order and a Domestic Stay Away Order. The Wife also filed Interrogatories, Request for Production of Documents, and a Request for Admissions. As a result of these filings, Wife was awarded a temporary <em>ex parte </em>protective order against physical abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-9\">The trial judge, on February 5, 1990, ordered appellant\u2019s predecessor to comply with plaintiff\u2019s request for Production of Documents and Admissions of Fact within fifteen days. If he failed to comply, the matters contained in the Request for Admissions of Fact would be deemed admitted, the defendant\u2019s pleadings would be stricken, the counter-complaint dismissed, and judgment by default would be entered. On February 20, 1990, the defendant responded. After acrimonious exchanges in the pleadings concerning defendant\u2019s alleged failure to comply with discovery requests, defendant\u2019s counsel, on October 10, 1990, simultaneously filed a Request for Admissions of Fact containing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>seventy-six items and a set of Interrogatories containing thirty questions. Wife responded on November 6, 1990 to Husband\u2019s Request for Admissions; and, on November 12, 1990, Wife responded to Interrogatories which had been propounded by Husband. On January 8, 1991, Husband\u2019s counsel filed Requests for Production of Documents and, on January 17, 1991, submitted his Motion to Compel Discovery and Order Admission of Facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-4\">Wife complained, in her Opposition to Motion to Compel filed on January 22,1991, that she had responded to \u201cdefendant\u2019s voluminous requests for admissions\u201d on November 6, 1990 and answered interrogatories on November 12, 1990. Her pleading further asserts that, when counsel protested that he had not received the documents and could not find them in the court files, her counsel forwarded another copy to Husband\u2019s counsel and the court. On January 28, 1991, Wife filed her response for Production of Documents. On March 13, 1991, the lower court granted the motion for Husband\u2019s counsel to strike his appearance and, on February 13, 1991, appellant entered his appearance. The March 11, 1990<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> trial date was continued and ordered rescheduled by the Assignment Office. After the entry of appellant\u2019s appearance, he requested and was granted a continuance, in order to allow him time to prepare.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">On or about March 1, 1991, Wife filed a second Petition for Protective Order, seeking relief from Husband\u2019s alleged abusive discovery. The petition asserted that Husband attempted to overwhelm Wife with unnecessary requests for discovery that had been answered previously. On March 4, 1991, Husband was served with the second protective order as well as Wife\u2019s discovery requests. Husband alleged that, although he had complied with all of Wife\u2019s discovery requests, she had failed to answer any of his requests. Husband then filed two Motions to Compel Dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>covery (one compelling the Production of Documents and another compelling the answering of Interrogatories). On February 26, 1991, the appellant had filed a notice to take the deposition of Wife and requested that Wife bring with her, among other things: (1) all records previously requested in Defendant\u2019s Request for Production of Documents, (2) all documents received since the <em>pendente lite </em>hearing, and (3) supplemental responses to Interrogatories and Requests for Production of Documents.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-4\">On April 9,1991, the trial court denied both of Husband\u2019s motions and granted Wife\u2019s second Petition for Protective Order, ordering \u201cthat [Wife] be excused from answering all further interrogatories or requests for production from [Husband]\u201d and further ordering \u201cthat [Husband] is barred from engaging in any further abusive discovery, including further interrogatories and requests for production from [Wife].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">On or about April 15, 1991, the appellant took the deposition of Wife and inquired as to whether she had brought the requested documents. She replied that she had not, and the deposition continued. The appellant subsequently filed a Motion to Reconsider the court\u2019s second Protective Order. As a part of its Opposition to the Appellant\u2019s Motion for Reconsideration, the appellee, on behalf of Wife, also filed a Motion for Sanctions in the form of attorney\u2019s fees, citing, as its basis for relief, the appellant\u2019s violation of the court\u2019s order against \u201cfurther abusive discovery.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b348-6\">In granting the appellee\u2019s Motion for Sanctions, the trial court found that the appellant had attempted to use both the deposition and a separate subpoena <em>duces tecum </em>for a Master\u2019s hearing to obtain documents from Wife, in direct violation of the court\u2019s protective order against further requests for documents.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-7\">With respect to the appellant\u2019s Motion for Reconsideration, the court noted that the appellant had filed the motion on Thursday, April 25, 1991 and, as previously mentioned, served Wife with a subpoena <em>duces tecum </em>on Friday, April <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>26, 1991 for a Monday, April 29, 1991 Master\u2019s hearing. The court also found that the appellant purposely did not send the court a copy of the motion, in order that he might have the opportunity to argue at the Master\u2019s hearing that there was currently a Motion for Reconsideration pending (since the court could not rule on a motion it had not received), in hopes of swaying the Domestic Master. The trial court found that the appellant acted with a total disregard for the order of the court and found that his actions amounted to \u201cabusive discovery.\u201d Consequently, the court awarded sanctions in the amount of $3,500.00, which represented the cost to Wife associated with her response to appellant\u2019s discovery requests, the appellant\u2019s Motion to Compel, and Wife\u2019s Motion for Protective Order.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-4\">Legal Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"Ahn\">Maryland Rule 1-341 states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-5\">In any civil action, if the court finds that the conduct of any party in maintaining or defending any proceeding was in bad faith or without substantial justification the court may require the offending party or the attorney advising the conduct or both of them to pay the adverse party the costs of the proceeding and the reasonable expenses, including reasonable attorney\u2019s fees, incurred by the adverse party in opposing it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">Sanctions, however, should not be imposed arbitrarily, but are \u201can extraordinary remedy [reserved for] <em>intentional misconduct.\" Talley v. Talley, </em>317 Md. 428, 438, 564 A.2d 777 (1989) (emphasis added). Moreover, sanctions should not be imposed simply because a cause of action avows a \u201cmisconceived legal basis upon which relief is sought,\u201d <em>Black v. Fox Hills North Community Ass\u2019n, Inc., </em>90 Md.App. 75, 83, 599 A.2d 1228 (1992), quoting <em>Hess v. Chalmers, </em>33 Md.App. 541, 545, 365 A.2d 294 (1976), or urges a legal theory which was not adopted by the court, <em>Black </em>[90 Md.App.] at 83, 599 A.2d 1228, citing <em>Dixon v. DeLance, </em>84 Md.App. 441, 579 A.2d 1213 (1990). As Judge Moylan stated in <em>Black, </em>\u201cRule 1-341 sanctions should be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>imposed only when there is a clear [and] serious abuse of judicial process.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 83, 599 A.2d 1228.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-4\">Before imposing sanctions under Rule 1-341, the trial court must make an evidentiary finding that the subject pleading either (1) was filed in bad faith <em>or </em>(2) lacked substantial justification. <em>Johnson v. Baker, </em>84 Md.App. 521, 528, 581 A.2d 48 (1990); <em>Legal Aid Bureau, Inc. v. Bishop\u2019s Garth Associates Ltd. Partnership, 75 </em>Md.App. 214, 220, 540 A.2d 1175 (1988). On appeal, the court\u2019s evidentiary finding will be reviewed under a clearly erroneous standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">Judge Alpert, writing for this Court in <em>Johnson, supra, </em>iterated that \u201cconduct lacks substantial justification when there is no basis in law and/or fact to support the plaintiff\u2019s claim against the defendants who seek fees and costs.\u201d <em>Id. </em>[84 Md.App.] at 529, 581 A.2d 48. As to bad faith, the Court of Appeals has defined the term as it applies to Rule 1-341 in <em>Inlet Associates v. Harrison Inn, </em>324 Md. 254, 268, 596 A.2d 1049 (1991):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-6\">\u201cIn bad faith\u201d means vexatiously, for the purpose of harassment or unreasonable delay, or for other improper reasons. <em>See Roadway Exp. Inc. v. Piper, </em>447 U.S. 752, 766, 100 S.Ct. 2455 [2464], 65 L.Ed.2d 488, 501 (1980); <em>Johnson v. Baker, </em>84 Md.App. 521, 581 A.2d 48, <em>cert. denied, </em>322 Md. 131, 586 A.2d 13 (1990).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b350-7\">In <em>Johnson v. Baker, supra, </em>at page 531, 581 A.2d 48 (citations omitted), this Court wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-8\">Previously, we had said that \u201c[u]nder Rule 1-341, \u2018bad faith,' in some circumstances, may include an action taken for the purpose of causing an unjustifiable delay.\u201d Thus, \u201c[t]he bad-faith exception for the award of attorney\u2019s fees is not restricted to cases where the action is filed in bad faith ... but may be found ... in the conduct of the litigation.\u201d Generally, the \u201c[m]isuse of a pleading ... amounts to bad faith.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b350-9\">In the case before us, the trial court found that the appellant engaged in \u201cintentional misconduct\u201d and violated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>the trial court\u2019s protective order by (1) taking Wife\u2019s deposition as a vehicle to request production of documents covered by the court\u2019s protective order, (2) issuing a subpoena <em>duces tecum </em>to Wife, and (3) filing his Motion for Reconsideration in bad faith. We hold that the trial court\u2019s finding that appellant engaged in abusive discovery and the court\u2019s award of sanctions against the appellant were not clearly erroneous and thus affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-4\">Violation of Protective Order</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">On April 9, 1991, as noted, the court granted plaintiff\u2019s motion for a protective order. The order specifically stated that the court had \u201cfound that Defendant and his counsel have engaged in abusive discovery\u201d and further barred defendant \u201cfrom engaging in any further abusive discovery, including further interrogatories and requests for production from Plaintiff.\u201d Although appellant now argues that he did not believe that the court\u2019s ruling prevented him from seeking the same documents from plaintiff by deposition, in his motion for reconsideration of the protective order filed on April 25, 1991, he maintained that the April 9 protective order barred the defendant from \u201cengaging in any further discovery, including Production of Documents____\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">On May 16, 1991, appellant moved for a continuance of the hearing on the motion to reconsider and on the plaintiff\u2019s motion for sanctions. Thereafter, on May 20, 1992, when he appeared before the trial judge at the sanctions hearing, appellant withdrew his motion for continuance. Appellant was aware that he had until May 17, 1991, to respond to plaintiff\u2019s motion for sanctions. Additionally, appellant\u2019s memorandum in response to plaintiff\u2019s motion for sanctions admits that he subpoenaed documents possessed by plaintiff from third parties <em>and </em>he nevertheless issued a subpoena <em>duces tecum </em>for the same documents to be produced at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-7\">On April 29-30, 1992, at the hearing on the merits, when plaintiff was cross-examined on the issue of the court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>protective order, plaintiffs counsel pointed out that the requested documents had been denied per the protective order. When the Master inquired of appellant why he wanted the records and asked whether \u201cthese are the same documents that have basically been the subject of a protective order with [the trial judge],\u201d appellant replied, \u201cSome of them yes and some of them no.\u201d Appellant later conceded to the lower court that they were the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-4\">Appellant argued at the merits hearing that the requested documents were still an \u201copen\u201d question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-5\">[APPELLANT]: ... I understand that [plaintiffs counsel] is saying that he has provided to me everything that he thinks is relevant, but what I am suggesting is that I do not have the ability to pursue this case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-6\">THE COURT: Well, as far as I know, there are no issues before me today having anything to do with that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-7\">[APPELLANT]: There is a motion to reconsider [the trial judge\u2019s] denial of the request for documents.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-8\">THE COURT: That has not been raised to me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-9\">[PLAINTIFF\u2019S COUNSEL]: I have never seen it, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-10\">[APPELLANT]: I understand that. It is in the file, and I didn\u2019t expect it to be reached today, but <em>for the record I think that it is still open on the question of [the judge\u2019s] denial of the request for documents.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-11\">THE COURT: I think it is going to become moot very quickly if this is a trial on the merits, don\u2019t you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-12\">[APPELLANT]: Well, if in fact we conclude it in the next two days.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b352-13\">(Emphasis supplied.) The Master was unpersuaded that the documents were relevant. The lower court opined at the sanctions hearing that appellant filed his motion for reconsideration of the protective order with the intention of going to trial with the production of documents still an open question.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>Ultimately, at the sanctions hearing, the court found that, after becoming counsel of record for defendant, appellant had been guilty of abusive process:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-4\">[APPELLANT]: Well, as I understand it, the only things that I have filed since I came on board were the two motions for compelling\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-5\">THE COURT: <em>And questioned everything that your predecessor did. I have read the file. You have gone back over that. You have gone over the material he did. You have covered that. You have sent that to them in addition to everything else. It is abusive. It is beyond the pale.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-6\">I meant it when I said don\u2019t do it any more and <em>I just said including interrogatories and including motion for production of documents. I said don\u2019t do it in discovery and you did it on a deposition, </em>didn\u2019t you?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Atx\">(Emphasis supplied.)</p>\n<p id=\"b353-7\">Thereafter, the court found that the filing of the motion for reconsideration was abusive process. At the sanctions hearing, when the lower court attempted to ascertain appellant\u2019s purpose in filing the motion for reconsideration of the protective order and in not seeking a ruling prior to the merits hearing, the explanation offered was found to be unsatisfactory. The trial judge made a factual finding that appellant had not notified the court of the motion, had made no attempt to get a ruling, and had intended to go to the merits hearing with a motion still outstanding:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-8\">THE COURT: ... I am absolutely convinced, and I think anyone who reads this record will be convinced, that Counsel abused process by filing it with the full intent that it not be acted upon and that it be \u2014 so that he could argue that there was a motion for reconsideration outstanding.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b353-9\">Next, the trial judge found that there was no basis on which to reconsider the protective order.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-10\">THE COURT: ... I find no basis to reconsider the original order. I am convinced that if Counsel had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>sought a ruling, Counsel would have had one prior to the hearing. Counsel did not seek any ruling, just simply filed it a few days before the hearing and let it lay there. That in itself was an abuse of the Court process because it was used for a purpose other than what process is designed to do.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b354-4\">Finally, the court determined that appellant violated the April 9 protective order:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-5\">THE COURT: Two other instances [of abuse] that I referred to were the orders of this Court. The order of this Court filed on April 11 was directly violated by Counsel. The actions by Counsel have been abusive in the filings made which led to the original order.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-6\">The order was specific about what should be done and could be done. The deposition that followed followed [sic] the order. Counsel was aware of the order, yet sought to use the deposition as a mechanism.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-7\">The order was very clear. It prohibited all discovery. That includes depositions. Still, the very same discovery was sought to be used and enforced in that deposition.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-8\">It was violated at the deposition. It may have been violated at the Master\u2019s hearing, directly violated. The process was used in a way that it is not designed and in total abuse of the Maryland Rules of Procedure and the rules of this Court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b354-9\">Thus, the court found that appellant had violated the court\u2019s order twice. The trial judge considered issuing an order to show cause why appellant should not be held in contempt of court. The court, however, indicated that it would refer the matter of appellant\u2019s violations of the court\u2019s orders to the Attorney Grievance Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-10\">The court imposed sanctions of $3,500 on appellant, because it found, on the evidence before it, that the amount awarded had been expended by plaintiff\u2019s counsel \u201cin connection with response to voluminous discovery requests and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>abusive discovery by the conduct that lacks substantial justification.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b355-4\">Before a court imposes sanctions, it must make an evidentiary finding of \u201cbad faith\u201d or \u201clack of substantial justification.\u201d <em>Johnson v. Baker, </em>84 Md.App. at 528, 581 A.2d 48. \u201cThe existence of bad faith or lack of substantial justification is a question of fact subject to a \u2018clearly erroneous\u2019 standard of review.\u201d <em>Id., </em>citing <em>Legal Aid Bureau, Inc. v. Bishop\u2019s Garth Associates Ltd. Partnership, </em>75 Md.App. 214, 220-21, 540 A.2d 1175 (1988), and <em>Century I Condominium Association, Inc. v. Plaza Condominium Joint Venture, </em>64 Md.Ap. 107, 117, 494 A.2d 713 (1985). Moreover, the <em>Johnson </em>court stated that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AgF\">[o]n appeal, the appellate court reviews the propriety of the sanction imposed under an abuse of discretion standard and will not disturb the sanction unless the court abused its discretion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b355-5\"><em>Johnson, </em>84 Md.App. at 529, 581 A.2d 48.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">Thus, the existence of \u201cbad faith\u201d or \u201clack of substantial justification\u201d is a question of fact, the determination of which may be reversed only if it is \u201cclearly erroneous\u201d and there has been an abuse of discretion by the trial court. Appellant contends that \u201cthe Protective Order in question is not specific on the issue of depositions.\u201d He insists that if taking the Wife\u2019s deposition is abusive discovery, such a determination is \u201cin violation of the United States Constitution ... [and] the Maryland Declaration of Rights and Rule 2-411.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b355-7\">We disagree. Rule 2-401 defines discovery to include <em>depositions, </em>interrogatories, and the production of documents. As noted above, the court\u2019s motion barred all further abusive discovery; and because depositions are included, the appellant was in clear violation of the court\u2019s order. Had the appellant simply withdrawn the subpoena or otherwise informed Wife not to bring the requested documents because of the court\u2019s order, the argument could have been made that the court\u2019s order was sufficiently <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>vague to allow the appellant to depose Wife. Appellant, however, sought to pursue further discovery on the occasion of the scheduled deposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-4\">It was not the deposition <em>per se </em>that was abusive discovery. It was the fact that the appellant asked Wife to produce the same documents which had been specifically excluded in the denial of appellant\u2019s Second Motion to Compel Production of Documents by Plaintiff.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Thus, it would seem, and the trial court so found, that the appellant\u2019s purpose in deposing Wife was an attempt to further pursue his quest for production of documents and to circumvent the court\u2019s protective order. On April 24, 1991, the appellant subpoenaed Wife to appear at an April 29, 1991 Master\u2019s Hearing and again requested that Wife bring with her documents that had been excluded when the appellant\u2019s Second Motion to Compel Production was denied and in the court\u2019s Protective Order of April 11, 1991. From these two instances, the trial court found, and we concur, that the appellant engaged in intentional misconduct and acted in direct contravention of the trial court\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">Subpoena <em>Duces Tecum</em></p>\n<p id=\"b356-6\">The record also supports the lower court\u2019s finding that the appellant violated its Order by issuing a subpoena <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number><em>duces tecum </em>to Wife. The subpoena was issued on April 26, 1991, a full fifteen days after the Court\u2019s protective order and specifically instructed Wife to bring: 1) financial statements for the past three years; 2) wage stubs for the past year; 3) copies of her three most recent State and Federal tax returns; 4) income statements for the past three years; 5) monthly statements, check registers and cancelled checks for the past two years; 6) all bank books, passbooks, and bank loan statements for the past three years; and 7) all monthly statements and receipts from any credit card account for the past two years.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-4\">It was precisely these documents which the appellant sought in his <em>two </em>Motions to Compel Discovery, both of which were denied, and his Notice of Deposition <em>Duces Tecum </em>of Wife, which were found by the trial court to be in violation of its protective order. At oral argument, the appellant maintained that a subpoena for trial could not be construed as discovery and thus could not be a violation of the court\u2019s order. Were this an isolated incident, appellant\u2019s argument might have merit. In light of the appellant\u2019s other discovery abuses, we find that the issuance of the subpoena <em>duces tecum </em>in this case was simply another attempt by the appellant to circumvent the trial court\u2019s protective order.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">Motion for Reconsideration</p>\n<p id=\"b357-6\">The court also determined that appellant\u2019s Motion for Reconsideration of Protective Order was filed without substantial justification. As stated above, the appellant filed the motion on Thursday, April 25, 1991 and served Wife with a subpoena <em>duces tecum </em>on Friday, April 26, 1991 for the Master\u2019s hearing on Monday, April 29, 1991. The appellant did not send the court a copy of the motion. Though the appellant argued that his failure to inform the court of his motion was simply an oversight on his part, the trial court found that it was an abuse of the judicial process to file a motion, not to resolve the issue, but instead to have another theory to argue at the hearing before the Master. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>If the appellant\u2019s desire to have the court reconsider the protective order had indeed been in earnest, we believe he would have taken all steps necessary to ensure that the court received a copy of the motion, which ostensibly the trial court would have ruled on promptly. The court properly determined that the failure to provide it with a copy of the motion was consistent with the appellant\u2019s prior attempts to circumvent the court\u2019s discovery rulings.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-4\">Scope of Discovery</p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">The appellant complains that under existing discovery rules the Husband \u201cclearly had a right to ask for the requested answers and documents.\u201d Citing Md.Rules 2-431 and 2-432, the appellant argues that he followed all procedural requirements pertinent to the filing of his objections to Wife\u2019s failure to produce the documents. The appellant further contends that his Motion to Reconsider, by definition, cannot be abusive because it is simply a proposal that the court take a certain course of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-6\">We agree with the appellant that, ordinarily, the scope of discovery is quite expansive, allowing for the discovery of almost anything. We further agree that a motion, in and of itself, is not normally abusive because, as the appellant states, it is simply a proposal to the court. We further agree that it is not the function of sanctions to punish legitimate advocacy or discovery. <em>Legal Aid Bureau v. Farmer, </em>74 Md.App. 707, 539 A.2d 1173 (1988), <em>citing Dent v. Simmons, </em>61 Md.App. 122, 485 A.2d 270 (1985). Finally, we note that the appellant did comply with the applicable rules on discovery in filing his motions and various requests for documents. Nevertheless, when the trial court perceives an abuse of the discovery process, on the part of either party, the court has the authority to restrict the scope of discovery to prevent the abuse. In the present case, the thrust of the trial court\u2019s finding of abusive discovery was that the appellant had made requests for all of the same documents as his predecessor had requested and received.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>From the beginning of the proceedings, Husband filed five discovery requests. Husband sought this information by way of Notice to Take Deposition <em>duces tecum, </em>the subpoena <em>duces tecum, </em>Request for Admission of Facts, Request for Production of Documents, and Interrogatories. All of Husband\u2019s discovery pleadings were promptly answered by Wife. In those requests that required the production of documents, Husband requested precisely the same documents each time.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> After Wife had answered Husband\u2019s requests, appellant filed two separate Motions to Compel Production, seeking the same documents. In engaging in such overtly duplicitous discovery, the court found abuse. When judged under the <em>Johnson </em>test, we find that the appellant\u2019s attempted discovery was in bad faith and lacked substantial justification because he already had possession of the documents that he sought to discover.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-4\">Improper Sanctions</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">The appellant next contends that sanctions were improper given that the court (1) improperly applied judicial hindsight, (2) awarded damages retroactively, and (3) failed to inquire into the appellant\u2019s ability to pay the sanction.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-6\">The concept of judicial hindsight applies to a situation in which counsel employs novel legal arguments in light of later developments. That concept applies, the appellant contends, because the trial court based its ruling on his Motion for Reconsideration on what the court would have done had the appellant brought the filing of the motion to the court's attention. We disagree. From our review of the record, the court based its ruling upon the appellant\u2019s violation of the court\u2019s protective order. The court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AO2\">... I find that $3500 in legal fees and expenses [is] in connection with response to voluminous discovery requests and abusive discovery by the Defendant... direct<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>ly instituted by Attorney Carl A. Jenkins, Esquire and for which Mr. Jenkins is responsible.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-4\">The other matters that I have referred to are also matters which in large part I am looking at because I have to look at the overall picture and there is more than abusive discovery.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-5\">There are violations of Court orders and abuse of Court process, all directly related to Attorney Carl A. Jenkins</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-6\">for which future action may be taken by this Court____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-7\">This Court assesses in fees $3500 to be paid by Attorney Carl A. Jenkins, Esquire to the Plaintiff in this case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-8\">[Plaintiffs counsel], you are asked to prepare an order which will assess those fees and which will deny the motion for reconsideration.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b360-9\">The appellant next contends that the trial court applied damages retroactively by allegedly assessing fees from the beginning of discovery, instead of limiting fees for the cost of defending the Motion to Reconsider. The appellant further avers that the award of fees was improper under the doctrine of <em>res judicata, </em>because Wife had previously requested fees in a Motion to Compel Discovery, which request was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-10\">First, as we shall discuss under the heading Abuse of Discretion, <em>infra, </em>the record shows that the trial court did not assess discovery fees from the beginning of discovery, but from the date of the court\u2019s protective order, which is fitting given that the violation of the order precipitated the sanctions.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-11\">Second, we find that Wife\u2019s claim for attorney\u2019s fees is not barred by <em>res judicata. </em>For the doctrine of <em>res judicata </em>to apply, the appellant must show: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number><em>See Lone v. Montgomery County, </em>85 Md.App. 477, 490, 584 A.2d 142 (1991); <em>Nicholson v. Unsatisfied Claim and Judgment Board Fund, </em>265 Md. 453, 458, 290 A.2d 384 (1972). In order for the doctrine to be applicable, <em>all </em>of the above criteria must be satisfied.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-12\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>1) That the issue in the current action is identical to the one determined in the prior adjudication.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-13\">2) That the parties in the current action are the same or in privity with the parties in the earlier dispute.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-14\">3) That there was a <em>valid, final judgment on the merits </em>of the issue in the initial action.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b361-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>In the present case, the third criterion \u2014 the requirement of a final judgment \u2014 is not satisfied because, as the appellant noted, Wife\u2019s request for fees was submitted as part of a Motion to Compel Discovery. As the court\u2019s ruling on the Motion to Compel Discovery did not constitute a final judgment, <em>res judicata </em>does not apply. <em>Res judicata </em>is further inapplicable because Wife\u2019s claims for fees came within the same proceeding, and the doctrine may be invoked only when there are similar claims raised in two separate proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-5\">Finally, the appellant asserts that the court erred in failing to inquire into the appellant\u2019s ability to pay the sanctions imposed. The appellant cites <em>Needle v. White, </em>81 Md.App. 463, 568 A.2d 856 (1990), for the proposition that it may be an abuse of discretion to impose a substantial monetary sanction on a litigant without first determining the financial ability of the litigant to pay the amount assessed.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-6\">The appellant submits that the court did not conduct an inquiry \u201cbecause as a matter of record and common knowledge, appellant had been in private, solo practice for barely two years, and admitted to the Maryland Bar for only four.\u201d We are unclear, and the appellant does not explain, how the court\u2019s asserted knowledge of the appellant\u2019s fledgling private practice controlled or otherwise influenced its decision to inquire.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-7\">In any event, our review of <em>Needle </em>reveals that the case does indeed stand for the proposition articulated by appellant, but is inapplicable here. The court trial in <em>Needle </em>arose from the claims of the former bookkeeper of a law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>firm which had prosecuted her unsuccessfully<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> for embezzlement. The firm had contended that their conduct was not so outrageous as to justify an action for intentional infliction of emotional distress. The firm argued that the civil action was in retaliation for criminal charges brought. The bookkeeper, on the other hand, contended the firm\u2019s motivation in bringing criminal charges stemmed from its efforts to collect on its employee fidelity insurance policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-4\">The primary focus in <em>Needle </em>was whether substantial justification existed for the firm to initiate civil proceedings. We noted that it may be an abuse of discretion to impose a <em>substantial </em>monetary sanction on a <em>litigant </em>without first determining the financial ability of the litigant to pay the amount assessed. The trial court, in <em>Needle, </em>had ordered the bookkeeper to pay the sum of $121,369.14 and attorneys, Needle and King, to pay the sum of $21,748.00. The award of $3,500 clearly is intended not to punish the appellant, but rather to compensate the plaintiff for the legal costs of responding to frivolous requests for discovery and cannot be said to be unreasonable under the circumstances of the instant case. <em>Beery v. Maryland Medical Laboratory, Inc., </em>89 Md.App. 81, 99-100, 597 A.2d 516 (1991), citing <em>U.S. Health, Inc. v. State, </em>87 Md.App. 116, 589 A.2d 485, <em>cert. denied, </em>324 Md. 69, 595 A.2d 482 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b362-5\">Discounting the notion that sanctions are appropriate only when the one sanctioned is the loser, we observed in <em>Needle, </em>81 Md.App. at 479, 568 A.2d 856, \u201cDilatory tactics, for example, or abusive conduct, or disregard of rulings by the court could result in some form of sanctioning, but there is no allegation of misconduct alleged herein.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b362-6\">Thus, although <em>Needle </em>requires that the trial judge determine a litigant\u2019s ability to pay before imposing sanctions, more pertinent is the language which supports the rationale <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>that sanctions are appropriate where counsel engage in abusive conduct or disregard rulings by the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-4\">Abuse of Discretion</p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">Finally, the appellant argues that the trial court\u2019s award of sanctions against the appellant was an abuse of discretion. The appellant more precisely contends that (1) the trial court\u2019s award of attorney\u2019s fees was not supported by the record, (2) the trial court failed to give the appellant adequate time to prepare, and (3) the amount of the court\u2019s award was not adequately documented.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-6\">As to the first and third contentions, Maryland courts have historically left the determination of the amount of the award under Rule 1-341 to the discretion of the trial judge to find according to his or her \u201cown knowledge of the case and the legal effort and expertise required\u201d and the affidavits of the parties. <em>Johnson, </em>84 Md.App. at 543, 581 A.2d 48, <em>quoting Century 1 v. Plaza Condo., </em>64 Md.App. at 121-22, 494 A.2d 713. <em>See also Brady v. Hartford Ins. Co., </em>610 F.Supp. 735 (D.Md.1985). Under the Maryland rules regarding sanctions for abuse of discovery, the primary focus of sanctions is to compensate the party against whom discovery is filed for the cost of complying with frivolous discovery requests. Since compensation is the goal, the test of an appropriate sanction is determined by what constitutes a reasonable amount for counsel fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-7\">In the present case, the appellee provided the court with an itemized list of discovery costs which actually totalled $5,550. The list was submitted in response to the court\u2019s request for verification of the exact amount. The appellant argues that because appellee had, in open court, originally given $3,500 as the amount of attorney\u2019s fees and then submitted the itemized list with $5,550 as the amount, the court\u2019s award of $3,500 is unfounded. A review of the itemized list submitted by the appellee reveals that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>$3,500 figure represents discovery costs from the date of the court\u2019s protective order through the hearing on the appellant\u2019s Motion to Reconsider and Sanctions.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b364-4\">In any event, in view of the fact that (1) Rule 1-341 does not require that the court articulate precisely the basis for its award, (2) given that the amount of award is historically left to the trial judge\u2019s \u201cown knowledge of the case and the legal effort and expertise required,\u201d and (3) the appellant did not object to the introduction of the $3,500 fee, we do not find that the amount of the sanction was an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">As for the appellant\u2019s second contention (that the trial court failed to give the appellant adequate time to prepare), the appellant asserts that his Constitutional due process rights were violated by the court\u2019s order to shorten response time. We are persuaded that the appellant was not denied adequate time to prepare for the hearing on his Motion to Reconsider and Sanctions.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-6\">The record reflects that the appellant was notified of the rescheduling of the hearing at 5:32 p.m. on Wednesday, May 15, 1991, and that the hearing was rescheduled for a Monday, May 20, 1991 hearing, thus allowing the appellant two work days, in addition to Saturday and Sunday, to prepare. As the appellant has correctly stated, this Court has ruled that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b364-7\">[a]n inherent problem arises in a sanction hearing addressed to both a claimant and counsel where, as here, they are not separately represented. A conflict of interest is foreseeable where both client and counsel may be pitted against each other in defending against Rule 1-341 sanctions. At a minimum, a trial court should ... allow a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>reasonable time to each party charged to prepare a defense and obtain separate counsel.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b365-4\"><em>Needle, </em>81 Md.App. at 480, 568 A.2d 856.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">As was pointed out by the Master and conceded by the parties, however, the issue of discovery was moot at the time of the hearing on the Motion to Reconsider and Sanctions, and therefore no prejudice attached with respect to the Motion to Reconsider as a result of the court\u2019s shortening of time.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-6\">The facts in support of the Motion for Sanctions were uncomplicated and required little, if any, research to prepare a defense. Additionally, the following transpired at the sanctions hearing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b365-7\">THE COURT: I have the appearances for the Defendant and Counter-Plaintiff. All right</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b365-8\">The first matter I want to take up is the matter of continuance. In light of the fact that I worked out with Judge Hyatt his holding you harmless, Mr. Jenkins, until we have completed this proceeding, do you press the motion for continuance?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b365-9\">MR. JENKINS: No, sir. I don\u2019t. And I would like to express my appreciation on behalf of you and your chambers in making those arrangements possible.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b365-10\">THE COURT: All right. Would you think it appropriate if you withdrew the motion for continuance?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b365-11\">MR. JENKINS: I would be happy to.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b365-12\">Thus, having withdrawn his motion for a continuance, appellant has waived any objection to the time granted by the lower court. The appellant also asserts that there was no immediacy that required a shortening of time. Because we have found that four days was adequate to allow appellant to prepare his defense to the sanctions motion, no prejudice attached as a result of the order to shorten time. Accordingly, we hold that the trial court did not err in imposing sanctions or in the amount of the award.</p>\n<p id=\"AhD\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-13\">COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLANT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b347-6\">. The record extract indicates the scheduled trial date was March 11, 1990. Apparently, the court\u2019s order granting the continuance is in error and should read \u201cMarch 11, 1991.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b356-7\">. At the hearing on the Motion for Sanctions, the appellant and the court had the following exchange:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-8\">THE COURT: You knew about the order, didn\u2019t you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-9\">[APPELLANT]: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-10\">THE COURT: You were under that order, weren't you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-11\">[APPELLANT]: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-12\">THE COURT: Did you try to get those documents from the Plaintiff notwithstanding my order?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-13\">[APPELLANT]: I asked her if she brought the documents and\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-14\">THE COURT: Were those the very documents that I had just ruled on?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-15\">[APPELLANT]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-16\">THE COURT: Then how come you are not in direct violation of my order and in contempt of Court?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-17\">[APPELLANT]: Because I asked her if she brought the documents in reference to the notice of deposition and she said no and that was the end of it.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b359-7\">.
