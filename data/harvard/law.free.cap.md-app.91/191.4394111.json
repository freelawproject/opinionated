The good news is that the law in this country is overwhelmingly on his side; the bad side is that the Maryland Court of Appeals ha[s] never directly had the issue before it. I can say that without any question.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b220-10\">What is the issue? The issue is that Mr. Tornillo as an outside sales representative, was required as a condition of his employment to furnish a vehicle and to bring that vehicle to work with him.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b220-11\">Judge William M. Cave of the Circuit Court for Montgomery County agreed with him for he ruled in his favor, and so shall we.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-12\">Appellants, Alitalia Linee Aeree Italiane and Graphic Arts Mutual Insurance Company, appeal from a judgment and order of the Circuit Court for Montgomery County which, <em>inter alia, </em>held that Tomillo \u201cdid sustain an accidental injury arising out of and in the course of his employment____\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Appellee claimed that he suffered personal injury while in the course of Alitalia\u2019s employment. A <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>bench trial was conducted on April 19, 1991, and the parties submitted one issue to the court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-5\">Whether the injury arose in the course of Mr. Tornillo\u2019s employment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-6\">The parties stipulated that on January 13, 1986 John B. Tornillo, an outside sales representative employed by Alitalia Linee Aeree Italiane Airlines, was required, as part of his job, to bring with him to work, an automobile or other similar vehicle for use during his work day.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b221-7\">The trial court determined that the \u201cgoing and coming\u201d rule did not apply to the facts before it because Alitalia <em>required </em>appellee, as a condition of employment, to have a car. The trial court concluded that appellee faced a danger different from that which other commuters face.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-8\">So, the logical application is, yes, he is exposed to a different danger because of the requirement that he bring his car back and forth to work. Whereas somebody who does not have that as a requirement has the option of taking the Metro, car-pooling, or whatever form of transportation that might be available to them aside from bringing their car in.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b221-9\">The circuit court dismissed the argument that appellee could leave the car parked at work.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-10\">Well, there is no testimony one way or the other specifically on that, but the testimony is clear that he needed his car also, not just during the day, but he may have to leave and go over \u2014 he may have to go to places on his way in to work, in to the actual office, and he may have to go to places after he left the office, driving the car, and then go home.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-11\">Certainly, it could not be seriously contended that the car is there, he drives it back and forth over there, that he would drive to Baltimore, bring the car back all the way back from Baltimore, rather than to come to Rock-ville, to go back downtown and leave it there and take the Metro. That does not make sense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b222-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>Appellants raise a single issue, which they characterize as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-4\">Does Maryland recognize an exception to the going and coming rule solely because it is necessary that the employee have an automobile in order to perform his job duties?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">Appellee was an outside sales representative for Alitalia. He worked out of an office located in Washington, District of Columbia. His position required him to have a car. Alitalia, following company policy, granted appellee an interest-free seven thousand dollar loan with which to purchase an automobile. He purchased a 1983 Toyota C\u00e9lica. Alitalia approved the auto that appellee purchased.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">Travel was a major component of appellee\u2019s job. His sales territory encompassed Maryland, Virginia, and the District of Columbia. Among other things, he delivered Alitalia promotional material to clients and prospective accounts, attended meetings, and ran company errands. At times, appellee would make sales visits on the way to work or on the way home. Alitalia reimbursed appellee for the miles travelled in furtherance of Alitalia\u2019s business. If appellee made a company trip on his way to work or on the way home, Alitalia would reimburse him for the mileage between the business stop and his home.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-7\">On January 13, 1986, while driving home (Rockville, Maryland) from the office, appellee \u201csuffered a loss of conscienceness [consciousness].\u201d His C\u00e9lica \u201coverturned and Tornillo was gravely injured.\u201d He was not on the way to or from a sales appointment. His automobile, however, was loaded with Alitalia materials which he needed for the coming week.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-9\">Appellants argue that the \u201cgoing and coming\u201d rule controls the facts of this case. Appellee and the lower court were of a different opinion. They believe that no Maryland case addresses the factual scenario of the case <em>sub judice, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>and that the going and coming rule is inapplicable to the instant case because Alitalia <em>required </em>appellee to furnish a car. Our research of Maryland case law indicates that the issue presented to us is one of first impression.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">We start our inquiry with an examination of \u00a7 9-101(b)(l) of the Labor and Employment Article.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-6\">(b) <em>Accidental personal injury. </em>\u2014 \u201cAccidental personal injury\u201d means:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-7\">(1) an accidental injury that arises out of and in the course of employment^]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b223-8\">The Court of Appeals has defined the words \u201cout of\u201d and the words \u201cin the course of\u201d on numerous occasions, <em>Wiley Mfg. Co. v. Wilson, </em>280 Md. 200, 205, <em>373 </em>A.2d 613 (1977):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aq5\">As we have said on numerous occadons, the words \u201cout of\u201d refer to the cause or origin of the accident, while the words \u201cin the course of\u201d relate to the time, place and circumstances under which it occurs.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b223-9\">Normally, an employee going to or coming from work is not protected under \u00a7 9-101(b)(l) of the Labor and Employment Article because the employee is not acting within his scope of employment. <em>Wiley Mfg. Co., </em>280 Md. at 205, 373 A.2d 613; <em>Dhanraj v. Potomac Elec. Power Co., </em>62 Md.App. 94, 99, 488 A.2d 512 (1985), <em>aff'd, </em>305 Md. 623, 506 A.2d 224 (1986). Gilbert and Humphreys, Maryland Workers\u2019 Compensation Handbook \u00a7 6.6 at 105 (1988) (footnotes omitted), suggest the reasons for the rule.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-10\">\u00a7 6.6. Going To and From Work.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-11\">Injuries sustained while an employee is traveling to or from the workplace ordinarily are not compensable. This is so because the hazards which employees face during daily commuting trips are common to the public at large. The risks to which an employee is exposed while going to or coming from work are no different from the ones which confront workers while they are traveling on personal excursions. Since the Act is designed to provide compensation for work-related injuries, the courts of this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>State have refused to convert employers into general insurers for their employees.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">According to the Court of Appeals, <em>Salomon v. Springfield Hosp., </em>250 Md. 150, 154, 242 A.2d 126 (1968),</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A6c\">traveling upon and crossing busy streets and highways, while it does entail some degree of danger, does not subject an employee traveling to and from work, to a greater degree of danger than he would be exposed to as a member of the general public.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b224-6\">There are numerous cases which adhere to the general rule. Yet, as one would expect, there are certain exceptions to the going and coming rule. Currently, Maryland recognizes six exceptions to the general rule. We delve into the various exceptions followed in this State with the following instruction from <em>City of Baltimore v. Jakelski, </em>45 Md.App. 7, 9, 410 A.2d 1116, <em>cert. denied, </em>287 Md. 758 (1980) (citation omitted) in mind:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-7\">[T]he Court of Appeals indicates that each modification case must be dealt with upon its own facts, and that seems the only justification for some of the exceptions which have been considered.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b224-8\"><em>See Wiley Mfg. Co., </em>280 Md. at 205, 373 A.2d 613; <em>Maryland Paper Prods. Co. v. Judson, </em>215 Md. 577, 584, 139 A.2d 219 (1958).</p>\n<p id=\"b224-9\">In <em>Carter v. M.V. Constr. Corp., </em>47 Md.App. 169, 173, 422 A.2d 44 (1980), the late Judge Thomas Hunter Lowe, speaking for the court, delineated four exceptions to the going and coming rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-10\">The \u201cgoing and coming\u201d rule has resulted in a voluminous body of litigation from which the Court of Appeals distilled a number of exceptions to the application of the rule. These exceptions may be stated as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-11\">(a) The free transportation exception</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-12\">(b) The employer conveyance exception</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-13\">(c) The premises exception</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-14\">(d) The proximity or special hazard exception.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b225-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>A. Free transportation exception</p>\n<p id=\"b225-4\">We addressed this exception in <em>Ryan v. Kasaskeris, </em>38 Md.App. 317, 328-29, 381 A.2d 294 (1977) (emphasis added).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-5\">[I]n terms of the \u201cfree transportation\u201d exception to the \u201cgoing and coming\u201d rule, an injury occurring while an employee is on his way to or from work, which otherwise would be noncompensable as being the result of normal hazards unconnected with the employment, becomes compensable only if, under the terms of the employment, the employer is under some <em>obligation to provide </em>the transportation to the employee. It is that underlying obligation which brings the travel within the scope of the employment. Where that obligation exists, the method of carrying it out becomes irrelevant; but where it does not exist, there is no coverage under this exception.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">Here it is conceded that Alitalia did <em>not </em>have an <em>obligation </em>to provide appellee with transportation. Appellee borrowed money from a commercial lender in addition to taking out an interest-free loan from Alitalia. He told the trial court about Alitalia\u2019s travel policy.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-7\">Q [MR. SIMMONS COUNSEL FOR APPELLEE] Now, up until that point, the cost of the operation of that car had been paid by Alitalia with their free cars and with their giving you the gas.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-8\">A Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-9\">Q That is correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-10\">A Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-11\">Q Now, at this point they said they were going to give you a travel allowance; did they also indicate how you were going to go about getting an automobile?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-12\">A Yes, they did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-13\">Q What did they tell you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-14\">A Yes, they did. They told us that they would also give us a substantial interest-free loan to purchase the car, so that way it wouldn\u2019t \u2014 you know, with this transportation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>package they would help us to get this car with an interest-free loan, and it was $7,000.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-4\">Q All right. So, you in fact took the $7,000 from Alitalia; correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-5\">A Yes, when I bought my car I did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-6\">Q Okay. Can you tell me whether or not you had to get any approval from Alitalia of the car that you were purchasing?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-7\">A Yes, the car had to be approved by management at headquarters.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b226-8\">Accordingly, this exception is inapplicable here.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-9\">B. Employer conveyance exception</p>\n<p id=\"A50\">In <em>Carter, supra </em>at 175-76, 422 A.2d 44, we cited Professor Larson\u2019s treatise on Workmen\u2019s Compensation for the proposition that a journey made in the employer\u2019s transportation is within the course of employment.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-10\">If the trip to and from work is made in a truck, bus, van [added in 1990 treatise], car, or other vehicle under the control of the employer, an injury during that trip is incurred in the course of employment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-11\">The reason for the rule in this section depends upon the extension of risks under the employer\u2019s control.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-12\">Another type of case in which the difference of reason must be observed is that in. which a substitution for the normal mode of transportation is made. If there is nothing more in the facts than the bare availability of the transportation in the employer\u2019s conveyance, which privilege the employee foregoes in favor of using his own car, motorcycle, or bicycle, compensation has been denied. This result is consistent with the present analysis of the underlying rationale of the employer-conveyance exception, since plainly the employee is not subject to the hazards of a facility of his employer while traveling in the employee\u2019s own vehicle.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b227-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>1 Larson, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 17.11, .13 at 4-209, -220 \u2014 222. Appellee purchased the C\u00e9lica in his name. Alitalia had no control over the car. The employment contract required only that appellee furnish a car for use during the day. This exception is also inapplicable here.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">C. Premises exception</p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">Once again, the <em>Carter </em>court, <em>Carter, </em>47 Md.App. at 177, 422 A.2d 44, cited professor Larson\u2019s work.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-7\">The course of employment is not confined to the actual manipulation of the tools of the work, nor to the exact hours of work. On the other hand, while admittedly the employment is the cause of the workman\u2019s journey between his home and the factory, it is generally taken for granted that workmen\u2019s compensation was not intended to protect him against all the perils of that journey. Between these two extremes, a compromise on the subject of going to and from work has been arrived at, largely by case law, with a surprising degree of unanimity: for an employee having fixed hours and place of work, going to and from work, [comma deleted in 1990 treatise] is covered <em>on the employer\u2019s premises.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b227-8\">1 Larson, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 15.10 at 4-3 \u2014 5 (1990) (footnotes omitted). The court also cited \u00a7 15.14, currently numbered \u00a7 15.14(a) &amp; (b) (footnotes omitted) (emphasis added).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-9\">One category in which compensation is almost always awarded is that in which the employee travels along or across a public road between two portions of his employer\u2019s premises, whether going and coming, or pursuing his active duties.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-10\">Since, as shown later, a parking lot owned or maintained by the employer is treated by most courts as part of the premises, most courts, but by no means all, hold that an injury in a public street or other off-premises place between the plant and the parking lot is in the course of employment, being on a necessary route between the two portions of the premises. But if the parking lot is a purely private one, the principle of passage between two parts of the premises is not available, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>and an employee crossing a public street to get to the parking lot is not protected.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">According to the <em>Carter </em>court, <em>Carter, </em>47 Md.App. at 177-78, 422 A.2d 44,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-6\">[t]he Court of Appeals has applied the \u201cpremises\u201d exception to those cases involving parking lots contiguous to the company premises. As the parking lot is generally owned, maintained and controlled by the employer, it is treated as a part of the employer\u2019s premises and includes the public street or other off-premises areas between the plant and the parking lot which encompass the necessary route between the actual premises and the parking area.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A5OG\"><em>See Saylor v. Black &amp; Decker Mfg. Co., </em>258 Md. 605, 267 A.2d 81 (1970); <em>Proctor-Silex v. DeBrick, </em>253 Md. 477, 252 A.2d 800 (1969). This exception is inapplicable to the factual scenario before us. Appellee, apparently, suffered his injuries on a public road far removed from Alitalia\u2019s premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-7\">D. Proximity or special hazard exception</p>\n<p id=\"A6R\">The Court of Appeals discussed this exception in <em>Wiley Mfg. Co. v. Wilson, </em>280 Md. 200, 208, 373 A.2d 613 (1977) (citing Larson).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-8\">Succinctly stated, the proximity rule is identified with those cases involving accidents which occur at a point where the employee is within range of dangers peculiarly associated with the employment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b228-9\">The Court, quoting from Larson\u2019s treatise, pointed out that the exception has two limitations.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-10\">The first is the presence of a special hazard at the particular off-premises point. The second is the close association of the access route with the premises, so far as going and coming are concerned.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b228-11\">1 Larson, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 15.13(b) at 4-35. Appellee was on his way home when he lost consciousness and control of his car. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>The record does not reflect that he faced a peril uncommon to society or one that the public is not usually exposed to. <em>Pariser Bakery v. Koontz, </em>239 Md. 586, 591-92, 212 A.2d 324 (1965). Thus, this exception does not apply to his situation.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">E. Special errand or mission exception</p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">We quoted this exception from Larson in <em>Fairchild Space Co. v. Baroffio, </em>77 Md.App. 494, 501, 551 A.2d 135 (1989).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-7\">[W]hen an employee, having identifiable time and space limits on his employment, makes an off-premises journey which would normally not be covered under the usual going and coming rule, the journey may be brought within the course of employment by the fact that the trouble and time of making the journey, or the special inconvenience, hazard, or urgency of making it in the particular circumstances, is itself sufficiently substantial to be viewed as an integral part of the service itself.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-8\">[T]he special errand rule is ordinarily held inapplicable when the only special component is the fact that the employee began work earlier or quit work later than usual.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-9\">The element of urgency may supply the necessary factor converting a trip into a special errand.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b229-10\">1 Larson, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7\u00a7 16.10, .14, .15 at 4-204, -208.27 \u2014 .28, - .39 (footnotes omitted). Appellee was not on a special purpose or mission. Granted, he had loaded his car with Alitalia promotional materials which he planned to distribute during the week. Nevertheless, he was on his way home from work \u2014 no sales stops impeded his journey.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-11\">F. Dual purpose exception</p>\n<p id=\"b229-12\">We turned to Larson, again, this time for his rendition of the dual purpose exception. <em>Fairchild Space Co., </em>77 Md.App. at 498-99, 551 A.2d 135.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>Injury during a trip which serves both a business and a personal purpose is within the course of employment if the trip involves the performance of a service for the employer which would have caused the trip to be taken by someone even if it had not coincided with the personal journey. This principle applies to out-of-town trips, to trips to and from work, and to miscellaneous errands such as visits to bars or restaurants motivated in part by an intention to transact business there.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-5\">The basic dual-purpose rule, accepted by the great majority of jurisdictions, ... may be summarized as follows: when a trip serves both business and personal purposes, it is a personal trip if the trip would have been made in spite of the failure or absence of the business purpose and would have been dropped in the event of failure of the private purpose, though the business errand remained undone____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-6\">If work is done at home for the employee\u2019s convenience, the going and coming trip is not a business trip within the dual-purpose rule, since serving the employee\u2019s own convenience in selecting an off-premises place in which to do the work is a personal and not a business purpose. The actual performance of the work itself may, under the rules of the next sub-section, be within the course of employment; but the trip is not, since it is transfer of the location of the performance and not the performance itself that serves the employee\u2019s personal purposes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b230-7\">1 Larson, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7\u00a7 18.00, .12, .33 at 4-256, -258 \u2014 274, -327 (footnote omitted). Appellee\u2019s trip home furthered his own ends. The record is devoid of information which would indicate that he was going to make a business stop on the way home or even after arriving at home. Accordingly, this exception is unavailing.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-4\">Although none of the extant Maryland exceptions to the going and coming rule are applicable to the case <em>sub judice, </em>appellee\u2019s cause is not lost, for we propose to adopt another. This new exception, like the six discussed above, is recognized by Professor Larson. Moreover, it is, we believe, entirely consistent with the other exceptions and with the policy behind the \u201cgoing and coming\u201d rule. Professor Larson states,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-5\">If the employee as part of his job is <em>required </em>to bring with him his own car, truck or motorcycle for use during his working day, the trip to and from work is by that fact alone embraced within the course of employment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">He explains the rationale for this exception is related to that of the employer-conveyance-exception and, like it:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AIx\">the obligations of the job reach out beyond the premises, make the vehicle a mandatory part of the employment environment, and compel the employee to submit to the hazards associated with private motor travel, which otherwise he would have the option of avoiding.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b231-7\">This exception also has an additional rationale:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aes\">in addition there is at work the factor of making the journey part of the job, since it is a service to the employer to convey to the premises a major piece of equipment devoted to the employer\u2019s purposes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b231-8\">1 Larson, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7\u00a7 17.51, .52, at 4-243 \u2014 244, -249 \u2014 250 (footnotes omitted) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b231-9\">Larson carefully distinguishes this exception, which he characterizes as the \u201cown-conveyance\u201d rule, from ordinary \u201cgoing and coming\u201d cases.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-10\">If the car trip from home to office was in the course of employment under the special rule, it would appear illogical to carve out a small segment of the total trip, that from garage to office, and for that distance reconvert the trip to a personal one. After all, the employee had to use his car to get to work because he had to have it available for his employer\u2019s purposes during the day; it follows <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>that he had to put the car in a garage; and thereafter he had to travel from the garage to the office. In short, the character of the journey from beginning to end was colored by the employment requirement of furnishing his own car during the day.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">1 Larson, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 17.54 at 4-254 \u2014 255 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b232-6\">Professor Larson is not the only adherent of this exception; indeed, it seems to be the position of the majority of jurisdictions which have considered the question.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Appellants ask us to disregard all of the cases which follow the own conveyance exception because \u201c[i]t is submitted that those out-of-state cases which have rejected Larson\u2019s \u2018own conveyance\u2019 rule are the better reasoned cases.\u201d In support of their position, appellants cite four cases: <em>In re Gwaltney\u2019s Case, </em>355 Mass. 333, 244 N.E.2d 314 (1969); <em>City of Dallas v. Bradford, </em>646 S.W.2d 302 (Tex.Ct.App.1983); <em>Postal Telegraph v. Industrial Accident Comm\u2019n, </em>1 Cal.2d 730, 37 P.2d 441 (1934); and <em>Chernick\u2019s Case, </em>286 Mass. 168, 189 N.E. 800 (1934).</p>\n<p id=\"b232-7\">In <em>In re Gwaltney\u2019s Case, </em>the Court reversed a lower court decision that awarded compensation to an employee who, after parking his car, injured himself (slipped on some ice) while walking towards his office. Gwaltney had planned to make some business visits, using his car, later that day. The Court stated that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>[t]he expectation or likelihood that Gwaltney later in the day might use his car to visit out of town clients does not alter the factual situation that actually existed at the time of the accident. Evidence that Babson would reimburse Gwaltney for the parking fee and other expenses incurred if he later used his car for business visits to clients outside the city does not lead to a different result.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b233-5\"><em>In re Gwaltney\u2019s Case, </em>244 N.E.2d at 315. We distinguish this case, primarily, because the Court\u2019s opinion does not indicate whether Gwaltney\u2019s employer required him to furnish his own transportation for business purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\"><em>City of Dallas v. Bradford, </em>646 S.W.2d 302 (Tex.Ct.App.1983), is controlled by a local statute. The Texas statute provided that an employee cannot recover for injuries sustained during transit unless the transportation is: (1) furnished as part of the employment contract; (2) paid for by the employer; (3) under the employer\u2019s control; or (4) when the employer directs the employee to proceed from one place to another. <em>City of Dallas, </em>646 S.W.2d at 304 (discussing Tex.Rev.Civ.Stat.Ann. art. 8309, \u00a7 lb (West 1967)). In addition, the <em>City of Dallas </em>court cited, with approval, <em>United States Fidelity &amp; Guar. Co. v. Flanagan, </em>134 Tex. 374, 136 S.W.2d 210 (Comm\u2019n App., Section A 1940) (opinion adopted by the Texas appellate court) (decided before the enactment of the statute at issue). <em>City of Dallas, </em>646 S.W.2d at 305. In <em>Flanagan, </em>the issue was whether a bicycle delivery boy could recover for injuries he suffered when a car struck him while he was riding home. There, the commissioner (whose opinion was adopted by the Texas appellate court), did not state whether the delivery boy\u2019s employer required him to furnish his own transportation.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aph\">For a few weeks prior to the accident he had been employed by the Drug Company to deliver parcels in the City of Beaumont. He furnished his own bicycle, kept it in repair and used same as a means of transporting the parcels. He could not have procured or retained his job without furnishing a bicycle.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b234-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number><em>Flanagan, </em>136 S.W.2d at 211. The only non-Texas case cited by the commissioner was <em>Postal Telegraph v. Industrial Accident Comm\u2019n, </em>1 Cal.2d 730, 37 P.2d 441 (1934), <em>overruled by Smith v. Workmen\u2019s Compensation Appeals Bd., </em>69 Cal.2d 814, 73 Cal.Rptr. 253, 447 P.2d 365 (1968) (plurality opinion). <em>Flanagan, </em>136 S.W.2d at 211. The California Supreme Court, in <em>Postal Telegraph, </em>annulled an award that the Industrial Accident Commission granted to Mahret, a motorcycle messenger, who was injured in a traffic collision while on the way to work. According to the Court, <em>Postal Telegraph, </em>37 P.2d at 442, Mahret furnished his own vehicle:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-5\">It may be fairly inferred that he was required to furnish and maintain the motorcycle for his use in messenger service, and, as above stated, his employer maintained no facilities for storing the car when off duty.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b234-9\">Nevertheless, the Court chose to follow the legal trend at that time and denied Mahret recovery. The California Supreme Court has subsequently overruled <em>Postal Telegraph. Smith v. Workmen\u2019s Compensation Appeals Bd., </em>69 Cal.2d 814, 73 Cal.Rptr. 253, 261, 447 P.2d 365, 373 (1968) (plurality opinion). Thus, we are, understandably, reluctant to rely upon <em>City of Dallas.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b234-10\">The last case cited by appellants in their attempt to sway us to their point of view is <em>Chemick\u2019s Case, </em>286 Mass. 168, 189 N.E. 800 (1934). The Massachusetts Supreme Court reversed a lower court\u2019s decision that was adverse to an insurer. On February 4, 1932, Joseph Chernick left his home earlier than he usually did to make some work-related stops that he had been unable to complete the previous day. On route to his stops, his car collided with two other automobiles and he was mortally injured. The Court denied recovery because it concluded that Chernick was not actively engaged in his employer\u2019s business as he had not reached any place where he had uncompleted work to perform. The Court did not mention whether Chernick had to furnish his own transportation.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>We are persuaded to adopt the own-conveyance exception to the going and coming rule based upon the reasoning of Larson, set forth above, and that adopted by the majority of jurisdictions. We find particularly persuasive the opinion of the Colorado Court of Appeals in <em>Whale Communications v. Claimants in the Matter of the Death of Susan Lee Osborn, </em>759 P.2d 848 (Colo.Ct.App.1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b235-4\">Susan Lee Osborn, a radio station employee, was killed while driving home from her office.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The Industrial Claim Appeals Office (Panel) awarded workmen\u2019s compensation benefits for Osborn\u2019s death. <em>Whale Communications, </em>759 P.2d at 848. On appeal, the court framed the issue as follows, <em>Whale Communications, </em>759 P.2d at 848:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b235-5\">The question is whether her death is compensable solely by virtue of the fact that she was required to use her automobile to meet with clients during the work day.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">Relying on the own-conveyance exception to the going and coming rule, the court affirmed the Panel\u2019s decision. <em>Whale Communications, </em>759 P.2d at 848-9 (citations omitted).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b235-7\">Generally, an injury sustained while going to or coming from work is not compensable. However, the requirement that employee bring her automobile to work for use in pursuing employer\u2019s business conferred an added benefit on employer beyond the mere fact of employee\u2019s arrival at work. Such special circumstances establish a causal connection between employee\u2019s work and her death and is an exception to the general \u2018going and coming' rule. The rationale for this exception is that the travel becomes a part of the job since it is a service to the employer to convey to the premises a major piece of equipment devoted to the employer\u2019s purposes. Such a requirement causes the job duties to extend beyond the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>work place and makes the vehicle a mandatory part of the work environment. In addition, a requirement to provide one\u2019s own automobile for work eliminates the employee\u2019s option to utilize other means of private or public transportation and thereby avoid the very sort of hazard that caused decedent\u2019s demise.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">Alitalia <em>required </em>appellee to furnish a vehicle for use during the business day. Appellee purchased a. vehicle, partly with Alitalia\u2019s aid, and put that vehicle to both business and private use. We agree with the lower court when it concluded that it would have been senseless for appellee to keep the car parked at Alitalia\u2019s place of business in Washington. One cannot plausibly argue that appellee, after making a sales stop close to his home, drive all the way back to the office and park his car.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-6\">Appellee undertook the dangers of highway travel so that he could furnish Alitalia with an automobile. He did not have the traveling options that most commuters may partake of, such as public transportation and car-pooling. Thus, we can confidently say, his injuries <em>did </em>arise out of and in the course of his employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-7\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED; APPELLANT TO PAY THE COSTS.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b220-14\">.
