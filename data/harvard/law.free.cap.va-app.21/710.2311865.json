White contends that the trial court erred by denying his motion for a transcript at state expense of his first trial, which ended in a mistrial; by admitting into evidence a 9mm handgun and expert testimony regarding the gun; and by failing to strike the evidence as to the grand larceny charge. We hold that the trial court did not commit reversible error and we affirm the defendant\u2019s convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-6\">I. Transcript</p>\n<p id=\"b757-7\">After the defendant\u2019s first trial was declared a mistrial because the jury was deadlocked, the trial court scheduled a second trial for September 28, 1994. On September 23, 1994, the defendant, an indigent, filed a motion for the court to provide him a transcript of the first trial. On September 26, the trial judge heard and denied the motion, stating, \u201cthe Court of Appeals might reverse me but I don\u2019t [provide transcripts at state expense] because if he were paying his own way he probably wouldn\u2019t have it done. If there is some conflict, material conflict, in the evidence which [the defendant] point[s] out, the Court Reporter will be here with her notes, so she can check her notes and find out.\u201d In addition, the trial judge stated that, \u201cI think the motion comes late ... I just don\u2019t think a normal person could write that up that fast.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b757-8\">\u201c[A]bsent a showing of good cause for delay, a defendant may waive his right to a copy of mistrial transcripts if he does not timely request them so as to avoid disruption of the subsequently scheduled trial.\u201d <em>United States v. Talbert, </em>706 F.2d 464, 470 (4th Cir.1983). Here, the defendant moved the court for a copy of the transcript five days before the second <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>trial was scheduled to begin; the hearing on the motion was held two days before trial. The record does not indicate a reason for the delay, nor does it show that the trial judge determined whether the court reporter had time to prepare a transcript before the second trial. Therefore, the record does not establish that granting the request would have disrupted the scheduled trial. Moreover, the trial judge indicated that he denied the transcript because, in his judgment, a non-indigent defendant would not have requested the transcript and because the court reporter\u2019s notes would be available and would be an adequate substitute for the transcript. Accordingly, we hold that the defendant made a timely motion for a transcript of the first trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-5\">The state must, as a matter of equal protection, provide an indigent defendant with the basic tools of an adequate defense, and there is no doubt that \u201cthe [sjtate must provide an indigent defendant with a transcript of prior proceedings when that transcript is needed for an effective defense.\u201d <em>Anderson v. Commonwealth, </em>19 Va.App. 208, 211, 450 S.E.2d 394, 395-96 (1994) (quoting <em>Britt v. North Carolina, </em>404 U.S. 226, 227, 92 S.Ct. 431, 433, 30 L.Ed.2d 400 (1971)). \u201cIn determining whether a defendant needs a free transcript, two factors are relevant: \u2018(1) the value of the transcript to the defendant in connection with the appeal or trial for which it is sought, and (2) the availability of alternative devices that would fulfill the same functions as a transcript.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 211-12, 450 S.E.2d at 396 (quoting <em>Britt, </em>404 U.S. at 227, 92 S.Ct. at 433).</p>\n<p id=\"b758-6\">In <em>Britt, </em>the Supreme Court noted that the value of a transcript from the first trial \u201ccan ordinarily be assumed,\u201d and that it is not necessary for a defendant to show \u201cparticularized need.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 228, 92 S.Ct. at 434. Moreover, the Court expressed \u201cdoubt that it would suffice to provide the defendant with limited access to the court reporter during the course of the second trial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 229, 92 S.Ct. at 434. In <em>Anderson, </em>we noted that \u201cthe alternative [of] ... reference to the notes of the court reporter at the first trial when a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>possible conflict in testimony arose during the second trial, was not the substantial equivalent of a transcript.\u201d <em>Anderson, </em>19 Va.App. at 213, 450 S.E.2d at 396-97 (quoting <em>Turner v. Malley, </em>613 F.2d 264, 267 (10th Cir.1979)); <em>see also United States v. Devlin, </em>13 F.3d 1361, 1364 (9th Cir.1994) (holding that \u201cask[ing] the court reporter to read back relevant portions of the suppression hearing at trial\u201d is not an adequate substitute for the transcript); <em>United States ex rel. Wilson v. McMann, </em>408 F.2d 896, 897 (2d Cir.1969) (holding that limited access to court reporter during second trial constitutes \u201ca case of too little and too late\u201d). <em>But see United States v. Tyler, </em>943 F.2d 420, 423 n. 4 (4th Cir.) (stating, in <em>dicta, </em>that access to court reporter is probably not limited when the trial court interrupts the trial to allow the defendant to examine the reporter\u2019s notes), <em>cert. denied, </em>502 U.S. 1008, 112 S.Ct. 646, 116 L.Ed.2d 664 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b759-5\">Here, the trial judge stated prior to trial that he would instruct the court reporter to have the notes from the first trial available during the second trial in the event material conflicts in testimony developed. This limited access to the reporter\u2019s notes did not enable the defendant to use the notes prior to trial in preparation of \u201can effective defense.\u201d As to whether a court reporter\u2019s notes might be a sufficient alternative to a transcript, the Supreme Court observed in <em>Britt </em>that \u201c[i]t appears that the reporter would at any time have read back to counsel his notes of the mistrial, <em>well in advance of the second trial.\u201d </em>404 U.S. at 229, 92 S.Ct. at 434 (emphasis added). However, in the present case, in order for counsel to identify material conflicts in the testimony presented at the second trial, she would have had to rely upon her memory or personal notes of the first trial. In this vein, the Supreme Court stated, \u201cWe have repeatedly rejected the suggestion that in order to render effective assistance, counsel must have a perfect memory or keep exhaustive notes of the testimony given at trial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Under the circumstances of this case, having the court reporter\u2019s notes available at trial was not a sufficient alternative to providing the defendant a transcript. We hold, therefore, that the trial judge erred in faffing to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>order a transcript or in determining whether a transcript could have been provided without disrupting the trial schedule.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-5\">Although the trial judge erred by denying the defendant\u2019s request for a copy of the transcript, we must determine whether the error was harmless. <em>See Tyler, </em>943 F.2d at 423. \u201cConstitutional error ... is harmless only when the reviewing court is \u2018able to declare a belief that it was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\u2019 \u201d <em>Lavinder v. Commonwealth, </em>12 Va.App. 1003, 1005, 407 S.E.2d 910, 911 (1991) (quoting <em>Chapman v. California, </em>386 U.S. 18, 24, 87 S.Ct. 824, 828, 17 L.Ed.2d 705 (1967)).</p>\n<p id=\"b760-6\">The defendant contends that Yvette Washington\u2019s testimony at the second trial was more specific than her testimony at the first trial. For instance, he alleges that Washington was more specific about how many times the defendant visited her apartment on the night of the crimes, and she testified that the defendant told her that he had been in a scuffle with two \u201cofficers\u201d as opposed to two \u201cpeople.\u201d Furthermore, the defendant notes that Washington did not testify at the first trial that she saw the defendant holding what appeared to be a gun clip.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-7\">Nevertheless, even had the purported discrepancies in Washington\u2019s testimony been considered sufficient to impeach her,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the other evidence of the defendant\u2019s guilt is overwhelming. <em>See Harrington v. California, </em>395 U.S. 250, 254, 89 S.Ct. 1726, 1728, 23 L.Ed.2d 284 (1969); <em>Schrum v. Commonwealth, </em>219 Va. 204, 213, 246 S.E.2d 893, 899 (1978); <em>see also State v. Brown, </em>306 N.C. 151, 293 S.E.2d 569, 578, <em>cert. denied, </em>459 U.S. 1080,103 S.Ct. 503, 74 L.Ed.2d 642 (1982). Both Officers Niedhammer and Hockman positively identified the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number>as the person who shot them. Officer Niedhammer testified that after his scuffle with the defendant, his handgun was missing. Latonya Alexander testified that on the night of the shooting she heard a gunshot and rushed to her window, whereupon she saw the defendant and two white men beside a car. According to Alexander, the defendant turned around and she saw \u201cfire come out [of] the gun\u201d he was holding. Brenda Brinkley testified that the defendant came to her apartment in the early morning hours of March 17 and asked her to arrange an exchange of a 9mm gun for cocaine with a group of people who lived across the street from Brinkley. Brinkley arranged the exchange, and the defendant went across the street and returned a few minutes later with cocaine. The next morning, she retrieved a 9mm gun from the neighbors with whom she had arranged the exchange, and gave the gun to the police. The Commonwealth subsequently determined that the gun Brinkley retrieved was Officer Niedhammer\u2019s gun and that it was the gun used in the shootings.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-5\">Although the first trial resulted in a hung jury, the record does not suggest that any \u201csignificant conflicts in the evidence\u201d existed. <em>Schrum, </em>219 Va. at 213, 246 S.E.2d at 899. Based upon our examination of the record, the trial judge\u2019s error in failing to provide the defendant with a copy of the transcript from the first trial was, in this instance, harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-6\">II. Handgun and Expert Testimony</p>\n<p id=\"b761-7\">The defendant, citing <em>Stevenson v. Commonwealth, </em>218 Va. 462, 237 S.E.2d 779 (1977), contends that the trial judge erred by admitting into evidence Officer Niedhammer\u2019s 9mm handgun. He contends that the evidence identifying it as having come from the defendant was inadmissible hearsay, and thus, that the expert testimony regarding the gun was admitted without proper foundation. The defendant asserts that Brenda Brinkley\u2019s testimony that she retrieved the gun from her neighbors was hearsay because it necessarily included the neighbors\u2019 implied assertion that the gun given to Brinkley <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>was the handgun given them by the defendant in exchange for cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-5\">In <em>Stevenson, </em>a police officer testified that he went to Stevenson\u2019s residence in Maryland and asked Stevenson\u2019s wife to retrieve the clothing her husband wore the day of the murder. She gave clothing to the officer. <em>Id. </em>at 464, 237 S.E.2d at 781. The Supreme Court held that the officer\u2019s testimony concerning Mrs. Stevenson\u2019s conduct \u201cwas intended as a nonverbal assertion for the purpose of showing that the shirt not only belonged to Stevenson but was in fact worn by him on the day of the crime.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 465, 237 S.E.2d at 781-82. The Court held that testimony concerning the wife\u2019s conduct in response to the request was hearsay and that admission of both \u201cthe shirt and the result of the scientific tests conducted thereon was without proper foundation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 466, 237 S.E.2d at 782.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-6\">The holding in <em>Stevenson </em>does not control this case. In <em>Stevenson, </em>the wife\u2019s conduct in response to the officer\u2019s request for the shirt Stevenson was wearing \u201cformed the basis of the Commonwealth\u2019s argument that [Stevenson] was wearing the shirt at the time the crime was committed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Her conduct in retrieving the shirt was an implied assertion that Stevenson was wearing the shirt on the night of the crime. Here, Brinkley testified that she arranged, at the defendant\u2019s request, an exchange of a handgun for cocaine between the defendant and her neighbors and that upon request from the police she went to her neighbors and retrieved a handgun. While one may infer that the handgun Brinkley retrieved was the one the defendant had exchanged, that inference flows from all the circumstantial evidence in this case and not merely from the alleged hearsay, as was the case in <em>Stevenson. </em>Unlike <em>Stevenson, </em>the officers in this case did not testify that they asked Brinkley to retrieve the defendant\u2019s gun. Brinkley did not testify that the neighbors said this was the defendant\u2019s gun. Brinkley did not testify as to what she asked of the neighbors or what they said or did in response to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number>her request. She testified only that she obtained a 9mm handgun from them.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-4\">Circumstantial evidence, other than the neighbors\u2019 act of giving the gun to Brinkley, connected the defendant with the 9mm handgun introduced into evidence. Both Officers Niedhammer and Hockman testified that the defendant shot them. Officer Niedhammer testified that during the scuffle with the defendant he discovered that his 9mm handgun was missing. Niedhammer also testified that he saw the defendant leaving the scene with a gun. Yvette Washington testified that shortly after the shootings she saw the defendant holding a gun clip. Brinkley testified that the defendant visited her apartment on the night the crimes were committed and asked her to contact her neighbors and arrange an exchange of a 9mm handgun for cocaine. After Brinkley arranged the exchange, the defendant went across the street to the neighbors\u2019 house and returned several minutes later with cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-5\">The following morning, Brinkley retrieved a 9mm handgun from the neighbors with whom she had arranged the exchange. That gun was later identified as Niedhammer\u2019s gun. The trier of fact did not have to rely on a nonverbal assertion by the neighbors to connect the defendant with the gun introduced at trial. Proof that Niedhammer\u2019s gun was missing after the scuffle with the defendant, that the defendant was seen leaving the scene with a handgun, that the same evening the defendant arranged an exchange of a gun for drugs, and that Officer Niedhammer\u2019s gun was retrieved from the persons who purportedly exchanged drugs for the gun, are circumstances which prove that the handgun admitted in evidence was taken by the defendant from Niedhammer. The trial court did not err by admitting the gun and the expert\u2019s ballistics testimony that the gun was used to shoot Officer Niedhammer.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-6\">III. Sufficiency of the Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b763-7\">After the jury returned the verdicts, the trial judge stated that he assumed the defendant was moving \u201cto set the verdict <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>aside [as] contrary to the law and evidence,\u201d whereupon the trial judge overruled the motion. Although objection in this form is not sufficient to preserve a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence, <em>see </em>Rule 5A:18, it is well established that \u201c[t]he purpose of Rule 5A:18 is to require a party to raise an issue in a timely fashion before the trial judge so the court has opportunity to address the issue and prevent unnecessary appeals.\u201d <em>Brown v. Commonwealth, </em>8 Va.App. 474, 480, 382 S.E.2d 296, 300 (1989). A general objection that the verdict is contrary to the law and the evidence fails to identify with specificity in what respect the defendant considers the evidence to be deficient. Here, however, the trial judge preempted the defendant from making a motion to set aside the verdict and ruled <em>ex mero motu </em>the evidence sufficient to support the grand larceny charge. For counsel to have objected further after the trial court\u2019s ruling would have been redundant and argumentative. We hold, therefore, that the trial court ruled on the issue of whether the evidence was sufficient as to the grand larceny charge. For this reason, the issue was preserved for appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-5\">\u201cIn considering the sufficiency of the evidence to support the convictions, we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, granting to it all reasonable inferences fairly deducible therefrom.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 480-81, 382 S.E.2d at 300. Officer Niedhammer discovered that his handgun was missing during the scuffle with the defendant, and he saw the defendant leave the scene of the crime holding a handgun. Yvette Washington testified that the defendant possessed what appeared to be a gun clip, and Brenda Brinkley testified that the defendant wanted to meet with some of her neighbors to exchange a 9mm handgun for cocaine. The handgun that Brinkley recovered from the neighbors the following morning was identified as Officer Niedhammer\u2019s gun. We hold that this evidence is sufficient, viewed in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, to support the defendant\u2019s conviction for grand larceny of Officer Niedhammer\u2019s 9mm gun.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>For these reasons, we affirm the defendant\u2019s convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"AM4\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b760-8\">. Defense counsel specifically questioned Washington about her failure to mention the gun clip at the first trial, which was the most significant discrepancy in her testimony. Therefore, although the court reporter\u2019s notes were not a sufficient alternative device to the transcript, they did serve to mitigate the prejudice that resulted from the denial of the defendant\u2019s equal protection right to the transcript.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
