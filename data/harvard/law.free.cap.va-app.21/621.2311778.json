Livingston (appellant) was convicted in a jury trial of possession of marijuana in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-250.1. On appeal, he argues that the trial court erred in: (1) denying his motion to suppress the drugs seized from his home because the warrant to search his home was issued based upon information provided by his wife; and (2) refusing to impanel a new jury for sentencing when the Commonwealth\u2019s attorney made an improper comment during closing argument. For the reasons that follow, we affirm the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b668-5\">Appellant and his wife, Susan Livingston, separated in 1992. On March 4, 1994, Mrs. Livingston initiated contact with Officer Brian C. Smith (Smith) of the Chesterfield Police Department and informed him that she saw marijuana and cocaine in the marital residence, where appellant was living. As a result of this information, Officer Smith brought Mrs. Livingston before a magistrate who issued a search warrant for appellant\u2019s home based upon her observations. Officer Smith executed the warrant and found loose marijuana, cocaine residue, and drug paraphernalia. Appellant admitted that he owned the drugs. Appellant was charged with misdemeanor possession of marijuana in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-250.1 and felony cocaine possession in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-250. Before trial, appellant moved to suppress the drugs, arguing that the search warrant violated the marital privilege of Code \u00a7 19.2-271.2 because it was based upon Mrs. Livingston\u2019s testimony. The trial court denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-6\">In a bifurcated jury trial on October 18, 1994, appellant was convicted of the misdemeanor marijuana charge, but was acquitted of the felony cocaine charge. Before the sentencing phase of the trial, the Commonwealth attempted to introduce appellant\u2019s prior drug conviction. Appellant objected, arguing that his prior criminal record was only admissible for sentencing purposes in a felony case. The trial court sustained his objection. In closing argument on sentencing, however, the Commonwealth\u2019s attorney asked for the maximum punishment and referred to appellant as an \u201cadmitted drug dealer.\u201d Appellant objected, and the trial court immediately instructed the jury to disregard the statement. After the jury retired to deliberate, appellant asked the court to impanel a new jury for sentencing and argued: \u201cWhen the Commonwealth interjected a convicted drug dealer into this, they got through the back door what they couldn\u2019t get through the front.\u201d Appellant did not request a mistrial or any relief other than a new sentencing jury. The trial judge denied the motion and stated: \u201cI don\u2019t think [the Commonwealth\u2019s attorney] deliberately did that, so I\u2019ve instructed the jury to disregard it.\u201d The jury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>sentenced appellant to the maximum punishment for possession of marijuana\u2014thirty days in jail and a $500 fine.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-5\">MARITAL PRIVILEGE</p>\n<p id=\"b669-6\">Appellant argues that the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress the drugs seized from his residence. He contends that the search warrant, based on his wife\u2019s observations, was issued in contravention of the marital privilege protection of Code \u00a7 19.2-271.2. The issue of whether the marital privilege extends to information provided by a spouse to a magistrate is one of first impression in the Commonwealth.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-7\">\u201cOn appeal, the burden is on appellant to show, considering the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, that the denial of the motion to suppress constituted reversible error.\u201d <em>Arnold v. Commonwealth, </em>17 Va.App. 313, 317, 437 S.E.2d 235, 238 (1993). \u201cCode \u00a7 19.2-271.1 provides that husbands and wives are competent witnesses to testify for or against each other in criminal cases except as otherwise provided [in Code \u00a7 19.2-271.2].\u201d <em>Brown v. Commonwealth, </em>223 Va. 601, 606, 292 S.E.2d 319, 322 (1982). Code \u00a7 19.2-271.2 provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b669-8\"><em>In criminal cases </em>husband and wife shall be allowed, and, subject to the rules of evidence governing other witnesses and subject to the exception stated in \u00a7 8.01-398, may be compelled to testify in behalf of each other, but neither shall be compelled, nor, without the consent of the other, allowed, to be called as a witness against the other, except (i) <em>in the case of a prosecution </em>for an offense committed by one against the other or against a minor child of either, (ii) <em>in any case </em>where either is charged with forgery of the name of the other or uttering or attempting to utter a writing bearing the allegedly forged signature of the other or (in) <em>in any proceeding </em>relating to a violation of the laws pertaining to criminal sexual assault (\u00a7\u00a7 18.2-61 through 18.2-67.10), crimes against nature (\u00a7 18.2-361) involving a minor as a victim and provided the defendant and the victim are not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>married to each other, incest (\u00a7 18.2-366), or abuse of children (\u00a7\u00a7 18.2-370 through 18.2-371). The failure of either husband or wife to testify, however, shall create no presumption against the accused, nor be the subject of any comment <em>before the court or jury </em>by any attorney.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b670-5\">In the <em>prosecution for a criminal offense </em>as set forth in (i), (ii) or (in) above, each shall be a competent witness except as to privileged communications.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b670-6\">(Emphasis added.) <em>See Creech v. Commonwealth, </em>242 Va. 385, 386, 410 S.E.2d 650, 651 (1991). \u201cThe privilege of an accused to prevent his spouse from testifying against him is determined <em>at the time of trial </em>and depends upon the couple being validly married at that time.\u201d <em>Stewart v. Commonwealth, </em>219 Va. 887, 891, 252 S.E.2d 329, 332 (1979) (emphasis added). The Commonwealth\u2019s attorney has \u201c\u2018the burden of first obtaining the consent of the accused husband before it will be allowed to call the wife as a witness against him.\u2019 \u201d <em>Brown v. Commonwealth, </em>208 Va. 512, 516, 158 S.E.2d 663, 667 (1968) (quoting <em>Wilson v. Commonwealth, </em>157 Va. 962, 968, 162 S.E. 15,16 (1932)).</p>\n<p id=\"b670-7\">In determining whether the marital privilege of Code \u00a7 19.2-271.2 applies to information provided in a police investigation, we must first determine the scope of the legislature\u2019s directive that the privilege applies only in a \u201ccriminal case.\u201d To do so, we must \u201cview the entire body of legislation and the statutory scheme to determine the \u2018true intention of each part.\u2019 In construing statutes, courts should give the fullest possible effect to the legislative intent embodied in the entire statutory enactment.\u201d <em>Virginia Real Estate Bd. v. Clay, </em>9 Va.App. 152, 157, 384 S.E.2d 622, 625 (1989) (citation omitted), <em>appeal dismissed, </em>398 S.E.2d 78 (Va.1990). \u201c \u2018Words in a statute are to be construed according to their ordinary meaning, given the context in which they are used.\u2019 \u201d <em>City of Virginia Beach v. Board of Sup\u2019rs of Mecklenburg County, </em>246 Va. 233, 236, 435 S.E.2d 382, 384 (1993) (quoting <em>Grant v. Commonwealth, </em>223 Va. 680, 684, 292 S.E.2d 348, 350 (1982)).</p>\n<p id=\"b671-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number> The Supreme Court of Virginia, in addressing this specific statute, held that \u201c \u2018[t]estimonial exclusionary rules and privileges/ which impair the right of the public to have all relevant evidence introduced in the fact-finding process, should be strictly construed.\u201d <em>Brown, </em>228 Va. at 606, 292 S.E.2d at 322 (quoting <em>Trammel v. United States, </em>445 U.S. 40, 50, 100 S.Ct. 906, 912, 63 L.Ed.2d 186 (1980)). \u201cCode \u00a7 19.2-271.1 should be given a reasonable construction. It is not a penal statute that must be construed strictly against the Commonwealth.\u201d <em>Brown, </em>223 Va. at 606, 292 S.E.2d at 322. The marital privilege of Code \u00a7 19.2-271.2 prevents spousal testimony against an accused only \u201c[i]n criminal <em>cases.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Whether pretrial investigative information or testimony given by one spouse against the other is included in the prohibition of Code \u00a7 19.2-271.2 is the determinative issue in the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-5\">The context of the phrase \u201ccriminal cases\u201d indicates that the legislature intended for the marital privilege of Code \u00a7 19.2-271.2 to apply in an adversarial trial proceeding. Code \u00a7 19.2-271.2 lists several exceptions to the general rule that an accused\u2019s spouse may not be called as a witness against him without his consent. These exceptions use the terms \u201cprosecution,\u201d \u201ccase,\u201d and \u201cproceeding\u201d to describe situations in which an accused\u2019s spouse may testify against him. By using these terms interchangeably, the legislature thus defined \u201ccriminal cases\u201d as \u201cprosecutions\u201d and \u201cproceedings\u201d and did not intend to include criminal investigation. Additionally, Code \u00a7 19.2-271.2 provides that \u201c[t]he failure of either husband or wife to testify ... shall create no presumption against the accused, nor be the subject of any comment <em>before the court or jury </em>by any attorney.\u201d (Emphasis added.) This language clearly contemplates an adversarial proceeding such as a preliminary hearing or trial, not pretrial criminal investigation by the police. Furthermore, case law interpreting the marital privilege of Code \u00a7 19.2-271.2 has dealt only with a trial. <em>See, e.g., Creech, </em>242 Va. at 386, 410 S.E.2d at 651 (trial); <em>Stewart, </em>219 Va. at 891, 252 S.E.2d at 332 (trial); <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number><em>Jenkins v. Commonwealth, </em>219 Va. 764, 767, 250 S.E.2d 763, 765 (1979) (trial).</p>\n<p id=\"b672-4\">Although no Virginia case specifically defines \u201ccriminal case,\u201d we hold that the plain meaning of Code \u00a7 19.2-271.2 is that the marital privilege contained therein applies only during an adversarial proceeding such as a preliminary hearing or trial. At the time Mrs. Livingston provided information to Officer Smith and the magistrate for the search warrant, only a criminal investigation had been initiated, not a \u201ccriminal case.\u201d The \u201ccriminal case\u201d contemplated by Code \u00a7 19.2-271.2 would encompass only potential testimony of Mrs. Livingston at the trial on the misdemeanor marijuana possession charge and at the preliminary hearing and trial on the felony cocaine charge. Thus, in the instant case, the trial court did not err in denying appellant\u2019s motion to suppress the drugs seized from his home.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-5\">CLOSING ARGUMENT BY COMMONWEALTH\u2019S ATTORNEY</p>\n<p id=\"b672-6\">Appellant next argues that the trial court erred in denying his motion to impanel a new jury for sentencing after the Commonwealth\u2019s attorney referred to him in closing argument as an \u201cadmitted drug dealer.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-7\">Code \u00a7 19.2-295.1 requires a bifurcated trial in felony cases, in which the <em>same jury </em>determines the guilt and punishment of a defendant in separate proceedings. Although appellant was not convicted of the felony of cocaine possession in this case, he was tried according to the bifurcated trial statute, and a separate sentencing proceeding was held.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Appellant did not request a mistrial or other appropriate relief, and impanelling a new jury was not a proper remedy.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-8\">\u201cEven if the argument were to be considered improper or irrelevant, it was cured by the trial court\u2019s cautionary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>instruction____\u201d <em>Hernandez v. Commonwealth, </em>15 Va.App. 626, 636, 426 S.E.2d 137, 143 (1993). \u201cA judgment will not be reversed for the improper admission of evidence that a court subsequently directs a jury to disregard because juries are presumed to follow prompt, explicit, and curative instructions.\u201d <em>Beavers v. Commonwealth, </em>245 Va. 268, 280, 427 S.E.2d 411, 420, <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 114 S.Ct. 171, 126 L.Ed.2d 130 (1993). In the instant case, although the Commonwealth\u2019s attorney referred to a fact not in evidence during closing argument, the trial judge immediately issued a broad cautionary instruction. Appellant failed to show that the Commonwealth\u2019s attorney\u2019s improper comment prejudiced the jury against appellant or that the jury disregarded the court\u2019s instruction. Thus, we hold that the trial judge did not err in refusing to impanel a new jury for sentencing purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-7\">Accordingly, the decision of the trial court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-8\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b672-9\">. Appellant raised no objection to the use of the bifurcated procedure on the misdemeanor charge.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
