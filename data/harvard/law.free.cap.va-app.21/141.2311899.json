Henry argues that the evidence was insufficient to convict him of escape, and that his misdemeanor convictions in general district court bar on double jeopardy grounds his circuit court conviction under Code \u00a7 18.2-478. Because assault of an officer is not a lesser included offense of escape from a police officer by use of force or violence under Code \u00a7 18.2-478 and because Henry\u2019s act of obstructing justice was a separate and distinct act from his escape, which the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence supported, we affirm Henry\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>The Commonwealth\u2019s evidence showed, in pertinent part, that law-enforcement officers, who had a federal indictment for drug trafficking, came to Henry\u2019s house to arrest him. A woman answered the door and said that Henry was getting dressed and would be out soon. A few minutes later, Henry ran out the back door into the woods.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">The officers pursued Henry through the woods and eventually caught up with him sitting beside a creek. One officer drew his gun, advised Henry not to move, and informed him that he was under arrest. The officer held Henry at gunpoint for about thirty seconds while he approached him, and then grabbed Henry by the arm. At this point, Henry struck the officer, shouted \u201c_ you, you can\u2019t shoot me,\u201d and fled. Later, the officers successfully apprehended Henry after a brief scuffle.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-8\">I. Sufficiency of the Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b189-9\">An essential element of the escape charge is that the defendant escaped from \u201clawful custody.\u201d Code \u00a7 18.2-478. Thus, we must determine whether sufficient evidence proved Henry was in police custody when he fled from the officers. We held in <em>Castell v. Commonwealth, </em>21 Va.App. 78, 461 S.E.2d 438 (1995) (en banc), that a person may escape from the \u201ccustody of an officer\u201d even though he is not in direct physical restraint. Although <em>Castell </em>was construing Code \u00a7 18.2-479(B),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the language of the two sections is not significantly different. Therefore, we hold that <em>Castell </em>controls the issue in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-10\">From the evidence presented, the trial judge could have found beyond a reasonable doubt that Henry submitted to the show of authority for thirty seconds while being held at gunpoint before he fled. In addition, Henry escaped after the officer had exercised actual physical force on Henry by grab<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>bing Henry\u2019s arm. Since Henry struck the officer when he fled, the evidence was sufficient to prove Henry escaped from custody of the law enforcement officer by use of force or violence.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">II. Double Jeopardy</p>\n<p id=\"Abd\">A. Obstruction of Justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-6\">Under <em>Blockburger, </em>the \u201capplicable rule is that where the same act or transaction constitutes a violation of two distinct statutory provisions, the test to be applied to determine whether there are two offenses or only one, is whether each provision requires proof of a fact which the other does not.\u201d <em>Hill v. Commonwealth, </em>2 Va.App. 683, 705-06, 347 S.E.2d 913, 926 (1986) (quoting <em>Blockburger v. United States, </em>284 U.S. 299, 304, 52 S.Ct. 180, 182, 76 L.Ed. 306 (1932)). \u201cThe test of whether there are separate acts sustaining several offenses \u2018is whether the same evidence is required to sustain them.\u2019 \u201d <em>Treu v. Commonwealth, </em>12 Va.App. 996, 997, 406 S.E.2d 676, 677 (1991) (quoting <em>Estes v. Commonwealth, </em>212 Va. 23, 24, 181 S.E.2d 622, 624 (1971)). Two crimes, even though similar because committed by the same criminal agent during a continuing course of action against the same victims, are not committed by the same act if not simultaneously committed. <em>Jones v. Commonwealth, </em>218 Va. 757, 761, 240 S.E.2d 658, 661, <em>cert. denied, </em>435 U.S. 909, 98 S.Ct. 1459, 55 L.Ed.2d 500 (1978) (theft of money and theft of automobile during robbery of motel).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b190-7\">In this case, the \u201csame act\u201d did not comprise both the charge of escape under Code \u00a7 18.2-478 and obstructing justice under Code \u00a7 18.2-460. The act which comprised Henry\u2019s escape occurred during the officer\u2019s second encounter with Henry when he struck the officer and fled after he was in custody on the creek bank. After his escape, during a third <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>encounter, Henry obstructed justice by impeding the officers in their attempt to regain custody of him when he struggled with the officers.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> While the two charges grew out of Henry\u2019s continuous course of action, the acts forming the basis for the charges were not committed simultaneously. Each crime was proved without resorting to evidence necessary to prove the other charge. Therefore, the Commonwealth\u2019s prosecution of Henry for both escape and obstructing justice was not barred on double jeopardy grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">B. Assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-6\">However, the assault charge under Code \u00a7 18.2-57.1 did stem from the same act. Thus, we must look at the two offenses charged for the same act under the <em>Blockburger </em>test. \u201c[I]n applying this test, the two offenses are to be examined in the abstract, rather than with reference to the facts of the particular case under review.\u201d <em>Blythe v. Commonwealth, </em>222 Va. 722, 726, 284 S.E.2d 796, 798 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b191-7\">It is clear that the crime of assault against a law-enforcement officer under Code \u00a7 18.2-57.1 does not contain the element of escape, as is required for a conviction under Code \u00a7 18.2-478. What we must determine, therefore, is whether the crime charged under Code \u00a7 18.2-57.1 contains an element not contained in Code \u00a7 18.2-478. We must determine whether every escape from the custody of any police officer by force or violence necessarily includes proof of all of the elements necessary to sustain an assault conviction. <em>See Kauffmann v. Commonwealth, </em>8 Va.App. 400, 409, 382 S.E.2d 279, 283 (1989). To prove the crime of escape by use of force or violence under Code \u00a7 18.2-478, the Commonwealth must prove beyond a reasonable doubt: (1) that the accused was in lawful custody; (2) of \u201cany police officer\u201d; (3) \u201con a charge of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>[a] criminal offense\u201d; and (4) that by the use of force or violence he left such custody without lawful permission.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">Henry argues that every use of \u201cforce or violence\u201d during an escape constitutes the crime of assault. We disagree. \u201cIt is a basic rule of statutory construction that a word in a statute is to be given its everyday, ordinary meaning unless the word is a word of art.\u201d <em>Stein v. Commonwealth, </em>12 Va.App. 65, 69, 402 S.E.2d 238, 241 (1991). The word \u201cforce\u201d means \u201cpower dynamically considered [or] strength directed to an end.\u201d Commonly, the word \u201coccurs in such connections as to show that unlawful or wrongful action is meant; e.g. forcible entry.\u201d <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>644 (6th ed.1990). \u201cViolence\u201d means an \u201cexertion of any physical force so as to injure or abuse (as in warfare or effecting entrance into a house),\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary </em>2554 (1981), or an \u201c[u]njust or unwarranted exercise of force, usually with the accompaniment of vehemence, outrage or fury.\u201d <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>1570 (6th ed.1990). Thus, an accused can be convicted of escaping from an officer by using force or violence not directed at the officer. For example, an accused could escape from an officer by jimmying the lock on the door of a squad car. In such a case, the accused could be prosecuted under Code \u00a7 18.2-478 because he used force to break out of the car, even though he did not assault an officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-6\">Thus, the crime of escape from lawful custody by use of force or violence contains an element of proof that is not required for the crime of assault. Because we are required to examine the two offenses charged against Henry in the abstract, rather than with an eye on the specific facts of his case, we hold that the crimes of assaulting an officer under Code \u00a7 18.2-57.1 and of escape under Code \u00a7 18.2-478 each contain elements of proof that the other does not.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b189-11\">. If any person lawfully confined in jail or lawfully in the custody of any court or officer thereof or of any law-enforcement officer on a charge or conviction of a felony escapes, otherwise than by force or violence or by setting fire to the jail, he shall be guilty of a Class 6 felony.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b190-8\">. While <em>Treu v. Commonwealth </em>and <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>were cases decided under Code \u00a7 19.2-294 rather than the double jeopardy clause, the analysis for what constitutes the same act or transaction is the same.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b191-8\">. Because we hold that the officer's third confrontation with Heniy constituted an obstruction of justice, we do not determine whether Henry obstructed justice when he initially fled from the officers after they arrived at Henry\u2019s house to take him into custody on the indictment.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b192-8\">BENTON, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"Au8\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-9\">Willie Jerome Henry was convicted of violating Code \u00a7 18.2^178, which provides in pertinent part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>[I]f any person lawfully in the custody of any police officer on a charge of criminal offense escapes from such custody by force or violence, he shall be guilty of a Class 6 felony.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b193-7\">Because the police officer never had control of Henry\u2019s person, I would hold that Henry was not in lawful custody and could not have violated this statute when he fled. <em>See Johnson v. Commonwealth, </em>21 Va.App. 102, 108, 462 S.E.2d 125, 128 (1995) (Benton, J., dissenting); <em>Castell v. Commonwealth, </em>21 Va.App. 78, 82, 461 S.E.2d 438, 440 (1995) (en banc) (Benton, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b193-8\">\u201c[T]he Due Process Clause protects the accused against conviction except upon proof beyond a reasonable doubt of every fact necessary to constitute the crime with which he is charged.\u201d <em>In re Winship, </em>397 U.S. 358, 364, 90 S.Ct. 1068, 1073, 25 L.Ed.2d 368 (1970). The Commonwealth failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Henry was in the officer\u2019s custody. The officer was attempting to arrest Henry when Henry fled. The evidence proved that the officer had not gained control of Henry and that Henry had not submitted to the officer\u2019s authority. From the time Henry ran from the house until the final encounter when the officer put cuffs on Henry\u2019s wrists, Henry never submitted to the officer\u2019s authority. Evidence that the officer pointed his gun at Henry for thirty seconds while the officer approached and attempted to apprehend Henry does not prove that Henry submitted to the officer\u2019s authority. The evidence is undisputed that Henry verbally challenged the officer\u2019s willingness to shoot him and fled. Thus, Henry never submitted to the officer\u2019s authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-9\">Upon this evidence, the Commonwealth did not prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Henry was in the officer\u2019s custody and, thus, failed to prove the element necessary to sustain a conviction under Code \u00a7 18.2-478. For these reasons, I would hold that the evidence was insufficient to uphold the conviction.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
