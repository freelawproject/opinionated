Jerabek, Inc. (employer) urges that we dismiss the appeal, contending that the health care providers were indispensable, though excluded, parties. Employer also concurs in the commission\u2019s finding that the underlying claim was not contested. For the reasons that follow, we reverse the decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">The pertinent facts are substantially uncontroverted. On February 19, 1994, claimant was accidentally injured incidental to her employment. She subsequently retained counsel to pursue benefits under the Act, and a claim was lodged with the commission on March 11, 1994, accompanied by interrogatories and a request for production directed to employer. Employer received notice of the filing on March 12, 1994, and immediately retained counsel, Ms. Mary G. Commander, who \u201cthereafter began [an] investigation into the facts of the injury, wages, insurance coverage, etc.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b97-6\">On March 30, 1994, the commission noticed employer and Lumbermen\u2019s Mutual Casualty Co. (Lumbermen\u2019s), then identified as employer\u2019s \u201ccarrier,\u201d of the pending claim, together with a request for related documentation. This correspondence was followed on April 1, 1994, by an order of the commission directing the \u201ccarrier\u201d to complete and return attached form \u201cOrder(s)\u201d reporting the status of the claim. In response, the commission received the \u201cEmployer\u2019s First Report Of Accident\u201d from Ms. Commander on April 14, 1994, accompanied by a letter which expressed her \u201cunderstanding that Kemper<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> will be assuming the handling, and defense, if any, of this claim.\u201d On that same date, however, Kemper notified the commission that it had declined coverage to employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>Counsel acknowledged receipt of Ms. Commander\u2019s letter to the commission \u201cregarding [the] insurance coverage issue\u201d and requested immediate clarification due to claimant\u2019s \u201cfinancial hardship.\u201d In later correspondence to Ms. Commander, dated April 22, 1994, counsel noted that \u201cpresent information\u201d indicated employer was \u201cuninsured\u201d and, again, requested a \u201ctimely\u201d resolution of this issue. On April 23, 1994, Ms. Commander answered:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-5\">In response to your concern, the Commission has never been advised that there is coverage so I assume that they have been treating this (or should have been, in any event) as a case which should be handled through the Uninsured Fund. That has been my assumption throughout. You may want to confirm this directly.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b98-6\">In the interim, counsel moved the commission, on April 4, 1994, to compel employer\u2019s response to the pending discovery. Thereafter, on April 20, 1994, employer answered claimant\u2019s interrogatories, declaring its intention to assert the defense that \u201c[e]laimant was a casual worker,\u201d not committed to \u201cworking on a regular basis,\u201d with a \u201cfull-time job elsewhere.\u201d <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Employer also reported claimant\u2019s wage at $12.00 per week, plus tips. These responses prompted counsel to propound supplemental interrogatories to employer, \u201cnarrowly tailored\u201d to the \u201ccasual worker\u201d defense and wage issues. By letter to counsel dated April 23, 1994, Ms. Commander then advised that she did \u201cnot believe that there is a defense to the claim\u201d and denied the existence of \u201cany records\u201d of claimant\u2019s wages.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-7\">Pursuing the wage issue, counsel noticed employer to take the depositions of its employee, Anna Jerabek. However, Ms. Commander moved to quash, arguing that employer had \u201cno idea whatsoever as to claimant\u2019s average weekly wage\u201d and that the scheduled time and date conflicted with a prior commitment. The commission thereafter quashed the notice, \u201cfor good cause shown,\u201d and \u201cencourage[d] the parties to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>discuss the issue of the average weekly wage and attempt to reach an agreement\u201d before again pursuing depositions. When subsequent settlement negotiations proved unsuccessful, the wage issue was submitted for determination by the commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-5\">Following a hearing, the deputy, by opinion dated September 7, 1994, awarded temporary total disability and medical benefits to claimant, a fee to counsel and imposed a fine upon employer for failure to maintain the requisite insurance.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Counsel thereafter moved the commission to allow additional attorney\u2019s fees from those monies payable from the award to claimant\u2019s health care providers pursuant to Code \u00a7 65.2-714, mailing notice of this claim to the several providers in accordance with Rule 18 of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission Rules. Counsel also submitted to the commission numerous proposed orders, each of which was agreed to and endorsed by a named health care provider and allotted a specific fee to counsel from the award to such provider.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-6\">Before the commission acted on counsel\u2019s request, Ms. Commander objected, contending that the underlying claim was not contested and had not required \u201cthe services of an attorney\u201d from \u201cwhich the health care providers benefited.\u201d Counsel disagreed and, following much correspondence between counsel, Ms. Commander, and the commission, a deputy determined that the original claim \u201cwas not \u2018contested\u2019 \u201d and \u201c[t]he Commission does not have jurisdiction to award attorney\u2019s fees, pursuant to Code \u00a7 65.2-714, in uncontested cases.\u201d On review, the commission concurred and counsel now appeals to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-7\">THE MOTION TO DISMISS</p>\n<p id=\"b99-8\">As a threshold issue, employer urges us to dismiss the appeal \u201cfor failure of the appellant/claimant to join all indis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>pensable parties.\u201d A single health care provider among the many that served claimant, Sentara Health System, Sentara Norfolk General Hospital (Sentara), filed a like motion through employer\u2019s attorney, Ms. Commander, despite its earlier endorsement, \u201cSeen and Approved,\u201d of a proposed order submitted to the commission which specifically awarded attorney\u2019s fees to counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-5\">Code \u00a7 65.2-714(A) provides, in pertinent part, that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b100-6\">Fees of attorneys and physicians and charges of hospitals for services, whether employed by employer, employee or insurance carrier under this title, shall be subject to the approval and award of the Commission.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b100-7\"><em>Id. </em>Further,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b100-8\">[i]f a <em>contested claim </em>is held to be compensable under this title and, after a hearing on the claim on its merits or after abandonment of a defense by the employer or insurance carrier, benefits for medical services are awarded and inure to the benefit of a third party insurance carrier or health care provider, the Commission shall award to the employee\u2019s attorney a reasonable fee and other reasonable pro rata costs as are appropriate from the sum which benefits the third party insurance carrier or health care provider.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b100-9\">Code \u00a7 65.2-714(B) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b100-10\">Rule 18 of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission Rules addresses consideration of those attorney\u2019s fees authorized by Code \u00a7 65.2-714.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b100-11\">An attorney\u2019s fee shall be awarded from sums recovered for the benefit of a third-party insurance carrier or a health care provider pursuant to \u00a7 65.2-714, Code of Virginia, only upon (1) evidence that such insurance carrier or health care provider was given reasonable notice that a motion for an award of such fee would be made and (2) evidence of the sum due such carrier or health care provider.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b100-12\">Employer does not dispute this well-established authority of the commission to control the \u201cfees\u201d and \u201ccharges\u201d of both attorneys and health care providers or the sufficiency of notice <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>attending counsel\u2019s claim in this instance. Rather, employer contends that the claim, related proceedings, and disposition necessitated a joinder of the health care providers as parties to this appeal. Employer reasons that the \u201chealth care providers are the ones from whom a substantial amount of money is sought\u201d and, therefore, each must be \u201cnamed ... appellees\u201d and \u201cprovided with a copy of the Notice of Appeal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">This argument ignores the procedural history of the claim. Despite notice, the record discloses that no health care provider sought party status at any time during the proceedings before the commission. Providers, including Sentara, appear in the record before the commission only to concur in the claim, joining in proposed orders awarding fees to counsel from the funds payable to each. Sentara\u2019s challenge and assertion of a right to party status is first raised before this Court in a motion to dismiss the appeal. Employer likewise first argued on appeal that the health care providers were indispensable parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">However, the question of party status to a health care provider in proceedings before the commission incidental to Code \u00a7 65.2-714 claims is a matter for determination by the commission in the context of applicable statutes and rules of procedure. <em>See Dep\u2019t of Game and Inland Fisheries v. Joyce, </em>147 Va. 89, 93-94, 136 S.E. 651, 653 (1927). Moreover, it is well established that this Court will not entertain issues first raised on appeal. <em>Green v. Warwick Plumbing &amp; Heating Corp., </em>5 Va.App. 409, 412-13, 364 S.E.2d 4, 6 (1988) (citing Rule 5A:18). Review of the posture of employer, Sentara, and the remaining health care providers on the record before the commission illustrates the wisdom of this rule. We, therefore, decline to now entertain the procedural complaints of employer and Sentara and overrule the motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-7\">THE CLAIM</p>\n<p id=\"b101-8\">In denying counsel\u2019s prayer for attorney\u2019s fees pursuant to Code \u00a7 65.2-714(B), the commission determined that the underlying claim was not \u201ccontested\u201d as contemplated by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>the statute. It is well established that \u201c[flactual findings by the commission that are supported by credible evidence are conclusive and binding upon this Court on appeal.\u201d <em>Southern Iron Works, Inc. v. Wallace, </em>16 Va.App. 131, 134, 428 S.E.2d 32, 34 (1993) (citing Code \u00a7 65.2-706). However, when the facts are undisputed, as here, their interpretation becomes a matter of law. <em>Wells v. Commonwealth, Dep\u2019t of Transp., </em>15 Va.App. 561, 563, 425 S.E.2d 536, 537 (1993). \u201cWe are required to construe the law as it is written\u201d and \u201c \u2018[a]n erroneous construction by those charged with its administration cannot be permitted to override the clear mandates of a statute.\u2019\u201d <em>Commonwealth v. May Bros., Inc., </em>11 Va.App. 115, 119, 396 S.E.2d 695, 697 (1990) (citation omitted). The \u201cclear and unambiguous\u201d words of a statute must be accorded \u201ctheir plain meaning.\u201d <em>Diggs v. Commonwealth, </em>6 Va.App. 300, 302, 369 S.E.2d 199, 200 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">Here, we find that the words, \u201ccontested claim\u201d in Code \u00a7 65.2-714 simply reflect the legislative requirement that the \u201cdispute, contention, or litigation,\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary </em>283 (1989) (defining \u201ccontest\u201d), combine with other specified circumstances attending a \u201cclaim ... held ... compensable,\u201d before attorney\u2019s fees \u201cshall [be] award[ed]\u201d incidental to \u201cbenefits for medical services\u201d arising from the claim which \u201cinure to ... a third party.\u201d Code \u00a7 65.2-714(B). The record reflects considerable dispute and contention from the inception of the underlying claim and the related litigation is manifest. Employer immediately retained counsel, expressly asserted (only to later abandon) a \u201ccasual worker\u201d defense, mistakenly claimed insurance coverage, and obfuscated evidence of claimant\u2019s earnings. Clearly, confusion and delay attributable to employer needlessly complicated and protracted the proceedings, leaving claimant without benefits for months while counsel pursued clarification, discovery, and negotiation with employer. Finally, the wage issue remained unresolved and required determination by the commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-6\">Under such circumstances, we find that the claim was contested, as a matter of law, by a recalcitrant employer, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>necessitating the assistance of counsel to successfully obtain benefits both to claimant and the health care providers. Accordingly, we reverse the decision of the commission and remand for a determination of reasonable and appropriate attorney\u2019s fees to counsel pursuant to Code \u00a7 65.2-714(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b97-7\">.

At the request of counsel, the award was ordered payable from the Uninsured Employer\u2019s Fund on October 3, 1994.
