The commission held that the decedent was not an employee of the City of Virginia Beach Police Department as defined by Code \u00a7 65.2-101 (\u201cEmployee\u201d) of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act (Act). The claimant contends that Compton-Waldrop was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>an employee of the City under the \u201cemergency employee\u201d doctrine because she had been \u201cdeputized\u201d to assist an auxiliary police officer with an emergency rescue. We hold that because the City of Virginia Beach had passed a resolution extending its workers\u2019 compensation coverage to members of its auxiliary police force, when Compton-Waldrop was required to assist the auxiliary police officer in the rescue, she became an <em>ad hoc </em>member of the auxiliary police force and thereby became an \u201cemployee\u201d under the Act by virtue of Code \u00a7 65.2-101 (\u201cEmployee\u201d) Subsection (1)(Z). Accordingly, we reverse the commission and remand the claim for entry of an award in accordance with this holding.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-4\">Joye Annette Compton-Waldrop worked as a restaurant manager. After an evening shift, she and a co-worker, Martin Egert, drove several employees home. Thereafter, ComptonWaldrop and Egert witnessed a serious two-car collision. They stopped and began rendering assistance to the injured occupants of the wrecked vehicles. While doing so, a City of Virginia Beach Auxiliary Police officer, George W. Starr, arrived and took control of the accident scene.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">Initially, Officer Starr ordered everyone to the side of the roadway. Mohients later, however, he directed Egert, Compton-Waldrop, and another gentleman to assist him. He told Egert to direct the headlights of his car to illuminate the accident scene and then to take a flashlight and reflective vest to alert oncoming drivers of the accident. Officer Starr told Compton-Waldrop to assist him with an injured person lying in the roadway who appeared confused. Officer Starr said to Compton-Waldrop, \u201cMa\u2019am come here, I need some help with this man.\u201d Compton-Waldrop responded and went onto the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>traveled portion of the highway to assist the officer. As Egert was walking up the roadway, a car sped past him and struck Compton-Waldrop and Officer Starr, killing both.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-4\">Whether a person is an employee under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act is a question of law, reviewable on appeal. <em>Humphries v. Thomas, </em>244 Va. 571, 574, 422 S.E.2d 755, 756 (1992). Because the right to recover under the Act is purely statutory, the legislature has exercised its authority to define who is and who is not an employee. Code \u00a7 65.2-101 (\u201cEmployee\u201d); <em>see Barksdale v. H.O. Engen, Inc., </em>218 Va. 496, 498-99, 237 S.E.2d 794, 796 (1977). Code \u00a7 65.2-101 defines the term, \u201cEmployee\u201d in subsection (1 <em>)(l) </em>as \u201c[e]very person, including a minor, in the service of another under any contract of hire or apprenticeship, written or implied, ... in the usual course of the trade, business, occupation or profession of the employer.\u201d In addition to the foregoing general definition, Code \u00a7 65.2-101 also identifies specific groups or classes of persons who are \u201cemployees\u201d under the Act. Thus, an individual is covered by the Act only if he or she qualifies as an \u201cemployee\u201d under subsections 1(b) through (q) or is in the service of another under a written or implied contract of hire or apprenticeship in the usual course of the employer\u2019s trade, business, occupation or profession.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">The claimant contends that Compton-Waldrop became an employee of Virginia Beach when Officer Starr required that she assist him in an emergency rescue of an injured motorist. In invoking the \u201cemergency employee\u201d doctrine, a principle recognized in a number of jurisdictions, <em>see, e.g., State ex rel. Nienaber v. District Court of Ramsey County, </em>138 Minn. 416, 165 N.W. 268, 268 (1917), she argues that Officer Starr made Compton-Waldrop a deputy subject to his command and control. <em>See also </em>IB Arthur Larson, <em>The Law of Workmen\u2019s Compensation </em>\u00a7 47.42(c) (1995); Annotation, <em>Implied Authority of Servant to Employ Another in Emergency So </em>As <em>to Create Relation of Master and Servant, </em>76 A.L.R. 963, 971(c) (1932). Consequently, because the power to control a person\u2019s actions is the most significant factor in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>defining a master-servant or employment relationship, <em>Inter-modal Servs., Inc. v. Smith, </em>234 Va. 596, 601, 364 S.E.2d 221, 224 (1988), Compton-Waldrop became a deputy, and thus, an employee under Code \u00a7 18.2\u2014463 and the doctrine of <em>posse comitatus.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b304-4\">Code \u00a7 18.2^63 provides that if a person, on being required to assist a law enforcement officer, refuses or neglects to assist in any case of rescue, the person shall be guilty of a Class 2 misdemeanor. The statute is founded in the common law doctrine of <em>posse comitatus.</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b304-5\">[A]s in the days of Edward I, the citizenry may be called upon to enforce the justice of the state, not faintly and with lagging steps, but honestly and bravely and with whatever implements and facilities are convenient and at hand.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AlE\"><em>Babington v. Yellow Taxi Corp., </em>250 N.Y. 14, 164 N.E. 726, 727 (1928).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b304-6\">This power of the sheriff, or his deputy, to summon aid in a proper case, in enforcing the criminal laws, is not open to question. It is of ancient origin and in the early days of our country\u2019s growth often was exercised. More recently, with the organization in almost every state of state-wide police agencies and the development in each county of the various states of a larger and better integrated sheriffs force, the occasion for resorting to the <em>posse comitatus </em>has diminished greatly. Nevertheless, the power is there. The sheriff may make the call and the citizen will ignore it at his peril.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aqt\"><em>Eaton v. Bernalillo County, </em>46 N.M. 318, 128 P.2d 738, 742 (1942).</p>\n<p id=\"b304-7\">The commission made no factual finding about whether Starr ordered Compton-Waldrop to assist him in the emergency rescue. However, the evidence proves, at a minimum, that Officer Starr required the three bystanders to assist him in securing the accident scene and in attempting to rescue the injured motorist. Thus, we find that Compton-Waldrop was required to assist Officer Starr subject to penalty under Code \u00a7 18.2-463 and, therefore, became an <em>ad hoc </em>member of the auxiliary police force.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>Although Compton-Waldrop was legally obligated under Code \u00a7 18.2^463 to assist the rescue effort and was an <em>ad hoc </em>member of the auxiliary police force, the fact that Officer Starr could control her actions does not alone render her an employee of Virginia Beach for purposes of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act. The purpose of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act is to compensate an \u201cemployee\u201d who is injured during and as a result of the employment, in an amount based upon a portion of the injured employee\u2019s average weekly wage. \u201cGenerally, \u2018a person is an employee if he works for wages or a salary and the person who hires him reserves the power to fire him and the power to exercise control over the work to be performed.\u2019 \u201d <em>Intermodal, </em>234 Va. at 601, 364 S.E.2d at 224 (quoting <em>Richmond Newspapers v. Gill, </em>224 Va. 92, 98, 294 S.E.2d 840, 843 (1982)). Whether a person is an \u201cemployee\u201d depends upon whether the person meets the definition under the Act, not whether the person satisfies a common-law definition of master-servant as a result of Code \u00a7 18.2-463 or the doctrine of <em>posse comitatus. Charlottesville Music Ctr., Inc. v. McCray, </em>215 Va. 31, 34, 205 S.E.2d 674, 677 (1974). A person may be an employee under the Act based upon an \u201cimplied\u201d contract of hire, Code \u00a7 65.2-101 (\u201cEmployee\u201d) (l)(a); however, if no contract to pay wages for \u201chire\u201d can be implied from the facts, a person is not an \u201cemployee\u201d under Subsection (l)(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b305-4\">Compton-Waldrop had no expectation that she would be compensated for her services. \u201c[E]xcluded from the definition of \u2018employees\u2019 [are] workers who neither receive nor expect to receive remuneration of any kind for their services.\u201d <em>Charlottesville Music, </em>215 Va. at 35, 205 S.E.2d at 678. Thus, Compton-Waldrop was not an \u201cemployee\u201d based upon an implied contract for hire under Subsection (l)(a) of Code \u00a7 65.2-101. If Compton-Waldrop was an \u201cemployee\u201d under another provision of the Act, only Subsection (1)(Z) is potentially applicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">Code \u00a7 65.2-101 (\u201cEmployee\u201d) (1 <em>)(l) </em>provides that for purposes of the Act, \u201cvolunteer lifesaving or rescue squad <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>members, ... auxiliary or reserve police ... shall be deemed employees <em>... if the [local] governing body of such political subdivision ... has adopted a resolution acknowledging </em>\u201d that coverage under the Act shall be extended to them. <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added). Virginia Beach has adopted such a resolution, which states in part:</p>\n<p id=\"b306-4\">Sec. 2-4. Recognition of police, fire companies and rescue squads as part of public safety program.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">In gratitude to and in recognition of the valuable and necessary services performed by police, fire companies and rescue squads and the individual members thereof, both professional and volunteer, which service the city, the following police agencies and chartered fire companies and rescue squads are recognized and acknowledged to be an integral part of the official public safety program of the city, and the volunteer members of these police, and chartered and nonchartered fire companies and rescue squads, shall be deemed employees for the purposes of the Virginia Worker\u2019s Compensation Act:</p>\n<p id=\"b306-6\">Hi H\u00ed H* H\u00ed * H\u00ed</p>\n<p id=\"b306-7\">Virginia Beach Auxiliary Police</p>\n<p id=\"b306-8\">H: H; Hi Hi * H;</p>\n<p id=\"b306-9\">Virginia Beach Rescue Squad, Incorporated</p>\n<p id=\"b306-10\">Subsection <em>(f)(1) </em>of Code \u00a7 65.1-101 (\u201cEmployee\u201d) enables local governing bodies to adopt a resolution extending workers\u2019 compensation benefits to members of volunteer rescue squads or auxiliary police forces, who serve the public without compensation. These persons become \u201cemployees\u201d at the locality\u2019s option. Virginia Beach adopted such a resolution extending coverage to members of the auxiliary police force, even though these \u201cemployees\u201d receive no weekly wage or have no expectation of remuneration.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-11\">We hold that when Officer Starr required Compton-Waldrop to assist him with the emergency rescue, thereby placing her in harm\u2019s way, she became an <em>ad hoc </em>member of the Virginia Beach Auxiliary Police Department, and, therefore, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>because Virginia Beach had passed a resolution extending workers\u2019 compensation benefits to members of the Virginia Beach Auxiliary Police, Compton-Waldrop was an \u201cemployee\u201d under the Act. Accordingly, we remand the claim to the commission for entry of an award in accordance with the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b302-6\">. Code \u00a7\u00a7 15.1-159.2(A) and 15.1-159.5 define the authority of auxiliary police officers. Code \u00a7 15.1-159.2(A) provides that an auxiliary police officer, \"when called into service ... shall have all the powers and authority and all the immunities of constables at common law.\u201d Although the record does not specifically address whether Officer Starr had been \"called into service\u201d by the City of Virginia Beach at the time, he was in uniform, and it appears from the record that the parties do not dispute that Starr was in service as an auxiliary officer.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
