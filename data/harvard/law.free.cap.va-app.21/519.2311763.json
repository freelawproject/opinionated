Defendant complains on appeal that the trial court erroneously permitted the jury to consider evidence, during the sentencing phase of the proceeding, of the punishments which attended his prior criminal convictions. We disagree and affirm the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-10\">The relevant procedural history is uncontroverted. Following conviction by the jury during the guilt phase of defendant\u2019s bifurcated trial, a \u201cseparate proceeding limited to the ascertainment of punishment\u201d was commenced in accordance with Code \u00a7 19.2-295.1, during which the Commonwealth sought to introduce certified copies of a \u201cSentencing Order\u201d and a \u201cCriminal Order.\u201d Each order recited a prior criminal conviction of defendant and included the punishment imposed for the respective offense. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 19.2-295.1. Defendant objected, arguing that the orders improperly disclosed the \u201cspecifics of the ... case[s]\u201d to the jury, not simply \u201cthe fact of ... conviction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b565-11\">Code \u00a7 19.2-295.1 provides, in pertinent part, that \u201cthe Commonwealth shall present\u201d to the jury during the sentencing phase of a bifurcated trial \u201cthe defendant\u2019s prior criminal convictions by certified, attested or exemplified copies of the <em>record of conviction </em>\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (emphasis added). The trial court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>concluded that the statute was \u201cmeant to allow the introduction of the ... order of conviction,\u201d which \u201cwould include ... the items\u201d subject of defendant\u2019s objection, and admitted the disputed orders into evidence as exhibits.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-5\">Defendant contends on appeal that the trial court\u2019s construction of Code \u00a7 19.2-295.1 infected defendant\u2019s sentence with the prejudice of prior punishments and that such information should have been redacted from the \u201crecord[s] of conviction\u201d submitted to the sentencing jury. In response, the Commonwealth urges a construction of the statute accommodating prior convictions <em>and </em>punishments within the statutory language, consistent with present procedure in bifurcated capital murder trials. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 19.2-264.2 <em>et seq. </em>Thus, the definition of \u201crecord of conviction\u201d intended by the legislature in drafting Code \u00a7 19.2-295.1 is the dispositive issue before the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-6\">We recognize that \u201cit is our function to interpret the meaning of the words in controversy as intended by the legislature.\u201d <em>Tiller v. Commonwealth, </em>193 Va. 418, 420, 69 S.E.2d 441, 442 (1952). However, \u201c[ujnless there is ambiguity in a statute, there is no need for interpretation, for the province of construction lies wholly within the domain of ambiguity.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cWords are ambiguous if they admit to \u2018being understood in more than one way[,]\u2019 ... refer to \u2018two or more things simultaneously^]\u2019 ... are \u2018difficult to comprehend,\u2019 \u2018of doubtful import,\u2019 or lack \u2018clearness and definiteness.\u2019 \u201d <em>Diggs v. Commonwealth, </em>6 Va.App. 300, 301-02, 369 S.E.2d 199, 200 (1988) (quoting <em>Brown v. Lukhard, </em>229 Va. 316, 321, 330 S.E.2d 84, 87 (1985)). Because the legislative definition of \u201crecord of conviction\u201d is susceptible to more than one interpretation, we find the language ambiguous and, therefore, appropriate for judicial construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-7\">Well-established \u201cprinciples of statutory construction require us to ascertain and give effect to the legislative intent.\u201d <em>Branch v. Commonwealth, </em>14 Va.App. 836, 839, 419 S.E.2d 422, 424 (1992). \u201cThe plain, obvious, and rational meaning of a statute is always preferred to any curious, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>narrow or strained construction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Because the Code of Virginia is \u201cone body of law,\u201d we may consult other statutes \u201cusing the same phraseology\u201d to assist us in divining legislative intent. <em>Id. </em>at 839, 419 S.E.2d at 425.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-5\">Bifurcated trials are not novel in our jurisprudence. Prior to the enactment of Code \u00a7 19.2-295.1, such proceedings were, and continue to be, integral to the prosecution of capital murder and traffic offenses. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7\u00a7 19.2-264.2, 46.2-943.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> \u201cThe purpose of a bifurcated trial is to allow the trier of fact to consider the prior ... record of the accused for sentencing purposes while avoiding the risk of prejudice to the accused when determining guilt or innocence.\u201d <em>Farmer v. Commonwealth, </em>10 Va.App. 175, 179, 390 S.E.2d 775, 776-77 (1990), <em>aff'd en banc, </em>12 Va.App. 337, 404 S.E.2d 371 (1991). Such information ensures an individualized assessment of a defendant\u2019s previous criminal conduct in the context of the subject offense, thereby promoting a more informed determination of sentence. <em>See O\u2019Dell v. Commonwealth, </em>234 Va. 672, 700, 364 S.E.2d 491, 507, <em>cert. denied, </em>488 U.S. 871, 109 S.Ct. 186, 102 L.Ed.2d 154 (1988); <em>Gray v. Commonwealth, </em>233 Va. 313, 346, 356 S.E.2d 157, 175, <em>cert. denied, </em>484 U.S. 873, 108 S.Ct. 207, 98 L.Ed.2d 158 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b567-6\">During the sentencing phase of capital murder prosecutions, \u201c[t]he fact finder is expressly enjoined to consider \u2018the past <em>criminal record of convictions </em>of the defendant.\u2019 \u201d <em>Saunders v. Commonwealth, </em>242 Va. 107,117, 406 S.E.2d 39, 44-45, <em>cert. denied, </em>502 U.S. 944, 112 S.Ct. 386, 116 L.Ed.2d 337 (1991) (quoting Code \u00a7 19.2-264.2) (emphasis added). In <em>Bassett v. Commonwealth, </em>the Supreme Court specifically permitted the jury to consider the sentences which attended Bassett\u2019s previous criminal convictions, reasoning that \u201c[t]he sentence reflects the gravity of the offense and the offender\u2019s propensity <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>for violence.\u201d 222 Va. 844, 858, 284 S.E.2d 844, 853 (1981), <em>cert. denied, </em>456 U.S. 938, 102 S.Ct. 1996, 72 L.Ed.2d 458 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b568-5\">This rationale serves the declared purposes of punishment for criminal conduct. \u201c[T]he sentencing decision ... is a quest for a sentence that best effectuates the criminal justice system\u2019s goals of deterrence (general and specific), incapacitation, retribution and rehabilitation.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>United States v. Morris, </em>837 F.Supp. 726, 729 (E.D.Va.1993); <em>see also Wilborn v. Saunders, </em>170 Va. 153, 160, 195 S.E. 723, 726 (1938); <em>Nuckoles v. Commonwealth, </em>12 Va.App. 1083, 1086, 407 S.E.2d 355, 356 (1991). Manifestly, the prior criminal convictions of a felon, including previous efforts to punish and rehabilitate, \u201c \u2018bear upon a tendency to commit offenses, the probabilities of rehabilitation, and similar factors\u2019 \u201d indispensable to the determination of an appropriate sentence. <em>Thomas v. Commonwealth, </em>18 Va.App. 656, 659, 446 S.E.2d 469, 472 (1994) (quoting <em>Eaton v. United States, </em>458 F.2d 704, 708 (7th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>409 U.S. 880, 93 S.Ct. 208, 34 L.Ed.2d 135 (1972)).</p>\n<p id=\"b568-6\">It is well established that \u201c Vhere the General Assembly acts in an area in which this Court has already spoken, it is presumed to know the law as the Court has stated it and to acquiesce therein.\u2019 \u201d <em>McFadden v. Commonwealth, </em>3 Va.App. 226, 230, 348 S.E.2d 847, 849 (1986) (citation omitted). Moreover, the legislature is deemed \u201c \u2018cognizant at the time it acted of all existing facts and circumstances\u2019 bearing upon and relating to its enactment[ ].\u201d <em>Virginia Dep\u2019t of Labor &amp; Indus. v. Westmoreland Coal Co., </em>233 Va. 97, 104 n. 2, 353 S.E.2d 758, 763 n. 2 (1987) (citation omitted). Thus, we find that the legislature incorporated the term \u201crecord of conviction\u201d into Code \u00a7 19.2-295.1 aware that its meaning includes both conviction and punishment, thereby intending to assist the jury in fashioning a sentence suitable both to defendant and the offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>Defendant reminds us that a statute \u201cpenal in nature ... must be strictly construed and any ambiguity or reasonable doubt as to its meaning must be resolved in [defendant\u2019s] favor.\u201d <em>Ansell v. Commonwealth, </em>219 Va. 759, 761, 250 S.E.2d 760, 761 (1979). However,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-5\">that rule of construction does not abrogate the well recognized canon that a statute ... should be read and applied so as to accord with the purpose intended and attain the objects desired if that may be accomplished without doing harm to its language. Any construction that has the effect of impairing the purpose of the enactment or which frustrates, thwarts or defeats its objects should be avoided.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b569-6\"><em>Gough v. Shaner, </em>197 Va. 572, 575, 90 S.E.2d 171, 174 (1955). Thus, the rule \u201cdoes not mean ... that [defendant] is entitled to a favorable result based upon an unreasonably restrictive interpretation of the statute.\u201d <em>Ansell, </em>219 Va. at 761, 250 S.E.2d at 761; <em>Davis v. Commonwealth, 4 </em>Va.App. 27, 30, 353 S.E.2d 905, 906 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b569-7\">Defendant\u2019s reliance upon our decision in <em>Hudson v. Commonwealth, </em>9 Va.App. 110, 383 S.E.2d 767 (1989) is misplaced. There, in addressing prior convictions as a statutory element in an enhanced punishment scheme during a unitary trial, we precluded evidence of prior sentences, acknowledging that \u201cjurors may ... weight ] the length of past sentences, rather than the fact of the past convictions alone, in determining [defendant]^ sentence.\u201d <em>Hudson, </em>9 Va.App. at 113, 383 S.E.2d at 769. In contrast, the bifurcated procedure established in Code \u00a7 19.2-295.1 clearly manifests a legislative intent to provide juries with information specific only to sentencing, apart from considerations of guilt or innocence, thereby similarly situating juries in felony cases with their counterparts in bifurcated capital cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-8\">Hence, we find that the trial court properly allowed the Commonwealth to disclose to the jury defendant\u2019s prior convictions, together with the attendant sentences, during the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>sentencing phase of his trial.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Accordingly, the conviction is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b565-12\">. Subject to certain provisions not relevant to this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b567-7\">. Code \u00a7 46.2-943 provides \"the court or jury trying the [\"traffic offense\u201d] may consider the <em>prior traffic record </em>of the defendant before imposing sentence (emphasis added). However, unlike Code \u00a7\u00a7 19.2-264.2 and -295.1, the statute expressly defines \"[t]he 'term prior traffic record' when used in this section,\u201d and the construction of that provision is not before the Court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b568-7\">. Recognized \u201c[t]heories of punishment\u201d include prevention, restraint, rehabilitation, deterrence, education, and retribution. Wayne R. La-Fave &amp; Austin W. Scott, Jr., <em>Substantive Criminal Law </em>\u00a7 1.5 (1986).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b570-15\">. We note that the prejudice which defendant attributes to the sentencing evidence in issue is belied by the record. The trial court instructed the jury on a penalty ranging from one to twenty years for the subject offense (a possible fine not to exceed $100,000 was omitted from the instruction), and the jury sentenced defendant to only three years. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 18.2-67.3(B).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
