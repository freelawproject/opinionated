The employers contend that no credible evidence supports the commission\u2019s finding that Ms. Monger suffered a compensable occupational disease under Code \u00a7 65.2-400. We agree and reverse the decision of the commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-13\">On June 2, 1993, Ms. Monger began work on Wrangler\u2019s production line. She performed several jobs, including: placing bands on jeans using her left hand to push the fabric through the machine; putting rivets on jeans with her right hand and placing buttons with her left; buttoning the jeans; and zipping the jeans using a pincer motion with her left <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>thumb and index finger. \u201cWhen [she] was putting [her] rivets on [on July 26, 1993 her] fingers (sic) swelled and a knot popped out in it and [she] went and turned it in as an accident.... [She] done the jobs all the way up to the rivets and [she] put the rivets on the jeans and when [she] buttoned the pants and zipped them up, that\u2019s when [her] finger started bothering [her].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b106-4\">Ms. Monger reported the swelling and stiffness to her supervisor. The next day, she sought treatment from her family physician, Dr. Prager. Dr. Prager diagnosed the swelling as \u201cinflammatory cyst [secondary] to repetitive trauma.\u201d He referred Ms. Monger to Dr. Frederick L. Fox, an orthopedist. On August 19, 1993, Dr. Fox diagnosed her as having a \u201ccyst of left index finger, compatible with a traumatic type episode.\u201d He placed her on medication and limited the use of her hand. Because she was unable to perform her regular job, Ms. Monger requested light duty work, but none was available. On September 20, 1993, she filed a claim for benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-5\">On December 21, 1993, Ms. Monger\u2019s attorney mailed Dr. Fox a questionnaire, including the following two questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b106-6\">(1) To within a reasonable degree of medical certainty, would it be your opinion that the repetitive nature of Ms. Monger\u2019s job at Wrangler directly resulted in her left index finger injury?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b106-7\">* * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b106-8\">(4) Could you please state whether the above noted condition would, in medical terminology, be considered a disease which is related to the claimant\u2019s occupation?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b106-9\">Dr. Fox responded \u201cYes\u201d to both questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-10\">The deputy commissioner denied Ms. Monger\u2019s claim for benefits. He found that she had not proved an injury by accident or \u201cthat her symptoms are the product of a disease or a disease process.\u201d He concluded that she \u201csuffered from symptoms produced by cumulative trauma.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b107-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>The full commission reversed the deputy commissioner\u2019s decision. Addressing the issue of whether Ms. Monger\u2019s condition was a disease, <em>Merillat Industries, Inc. v. Parks, 246 </em>Va. 429, 436 S.E.2d 600 (1993), the commission held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-5\">The medical evidence on this issue comes from Dr. Fox\u2019s responses to inquiries from claimant\u2019s counsel. While the first question posed by the attorney uses the term \u201cinjury,\u201d the final question asked, \u201cCould you please state whether the above noted condition would, in medical terminology, be considered a <em>disease </em>which is related to the claimant\u2019s occupation?\u201d The doctor responded yes. Although there is initial <em>reference </em>by the doctor on August 19, 1993, to a traumatic injury, this is not inconsistent with the development of a disease.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-6\">We therefore find that the condition is a disease.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b107-7\">Finding that the disease resulted from Ms. Monger\u2019s job, the commission awarded her benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-8\">Upon appellate review, the commission\u2019s findings of fact will be upheld if they are supported by credible evidence. <em>James v. Capitol Steel Construction Co., </em>8 Va.App. 512, 515, 382 S.E.2d 487, 488-89 (1989). \u201cA question raised by conflicting medical opinion is a question of fact.\u201d <em>City of Norfolk v. Lillard, </em>15 Va.App. 424, 429, 424 S.E.2d 243, 246 (1992). We view the evidence in the light most favorable to the party prevailing below, and \u201cthe fact that contrary evidence may be found in the record is of no consequence if credible evidence supports the commission\u2019s finding.\u201d <em>Bean v. Hungerford Mechanical Corp., </em>16 Va.App. 183, 186, 428 S.E.2d 762, 764 (1993). However, to be upheld, the commission\u2019s holding must find support in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-9\">To be compensable as an occupational disease, a condition must first qualify as a disease. <em>Merillat, </em>246 Va. at 432, 436 S.E.2d at 601. A disease is defined as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-10\">[A]ny deviation from or interruption of the normal structure or function of any part, organ, or system (or combination thereof) of the body that is manifested by a characteristic <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>set of symptoms and signs and whose etiology, pathology, and prognosis may be known or unknown.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b108-5\"><em>Piedmont Mfg. Co. v. East, </em>17 Va.App. 499, 503, 438 S.E.2d 769, 772 (1993) (quoting <em>Sloane-Dorland Ann. Medical-Legal Dictionary </em>209 (1987)). However, for purposes of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, the definition of \u201cdisease\u201d cannot be \u201cso broad as to encompass any bodily ailment of whatever origin.\u201d <em>Merillat, </em>246 Va. at 433, 436 S.E.2d at 601.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-6\">An injury is \u201can obvious sudden mechanical or structural change in the body.\u201d A disease is a condition, which may arise from any number of causes, including trauma, that impairs the function of the body or any part thereof. The distinction between injury and disease lies in the \u201cobvious sudden mechanical or structural\u201d aspect of injury.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b108-7\"><em>Perdue Farms, Inc. v. McCutchan, </em>21 Va.App. 65, 71, 461 S.E.2d 431, 434 (1995) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b108-8\">Dr. Fox gave contradictory opinions as to whether Ms. Monger suffered from a disease. On August 19, 1993, he diagnosed her as having a cyst on her left index finger due to the repetitive nature of her work and compatible with trauma. In three subsequent examinations, Dr. Fox never classified the cyst as a disease. Only in response to the questionnaire sent by Ms. Monger\u2019s attorney, suggesting that the cyst was a disease, did Dr. Fox answer, \u201cyes.\u201d However, this question was couched in terms of causation. This single, ambiguous answer is insufficient to overcome explicit, repeated, and uncontradicted medical evidence that the cyst, a sudden obvious mechanical change in the body, was not a disease but an injury caused by the repetitive trauma of Ms. Monger\u2019s job. Repetitive trauma injuries are not compensable under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act. <em>Merillat, </em>246 Va. at 433, 436 S.E.2d at 602.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-9\">The judgment of the commission is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-10\">\n<em>Reversed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b109-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>KOONTZ, Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AS6\">concurring in result.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">For the reasons more fully stated in my dissent in <em>Perdue Farms, Inc. v. McCutchan, </em>21 Va.App. 65, 74, 461 S.E.2d 431, 436 (1995) (Koontz, J., dissenting), I would reverse the decision of the commission.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
