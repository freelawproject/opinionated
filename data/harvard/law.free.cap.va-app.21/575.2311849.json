Finding no error, we affirm the commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-12\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-13\">The evidence proved that on October 24, 1988, Slaughter suffered a cartilage tear in his chest while he was employed by Bassett. Slaughter immediately reported his injury to a supervisor, who directed an employee to drive Slaughter to Dr. Ralph Godsey\u2019s office. Slaughter received a pain killer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>from Dr. Godsey and returned to work within a day or two of his injury. Slaughter testified that he was in pain every day and could not perform any lifting.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-4\">On April 7, 1989, Slaughter lost consciousness while driving home from work. He was taken to a hospital emergency room and then to Johnston-Willis Hospital where he stayed for nine days. While Slaughter was being treated for chest pain, his physician requested Dr. James A. Shield, Jr., a psychiatrist, to see Slaughter. During his initial examination of Slaughter in April 1989, Dr. Shield found Slaughter to be \u201cmassively depressed\u201d with a history of chest pain complaints, and he recommended psychiatric treatment. Slaughter then was transferred to the psychiatric section at Chippenham Medical Center. He remained in the psychiatric section of the hospital for fifty-six days and received treatment from Dr. Shield. Since his release from the hospital\u2019s psychiatric section, Slaughter has been admitted to the hospital seven other times due to his psychiatric illness.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-5\">Dr. Shield diagnosed Slaughter as suffering from major depression and severe chest pain. He described Slaughter as \u201ctotally controlled by his pain syndrome ... [and] totally] dysfunctional.\u201d In diagnosing Slaughter and investigating the cause of Slaughter\u2019s disorder, Dr. Shield learned of Slaughter\u2019s past medical problems. Dr. Shield opined that Slaughter\u2019s 1988 work injury was a precipitating event of Slaughter\u2019s \u201cdecompensation\u201d (defined by Dr. Shield as \u201cjust plain falling] apart\u201d). He believed Slaughter to be a hard-working, motivated individual until the pain from his injury caused his emotional collapse. He described the injury as \u201cthe straw that broke the camel\u2019s back.\u201d Dr. Shield testified that Slaughter \u201cwas in a massive, massive emotional decompensation\u201d that was caused by his depression over the pain that resulted from his work-related injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-6\">At the request of the employer, another psychiatrist, Dr. Robert S. Brown, Jr., interviewed Slaughter. He also reviewed Slaughter\u2019s medical, employment, and school records. Dr. Brown diagnosed Slaughter as suffering from somatoform <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>pain disorder that began in the early 1980s. He reported that Slaughter\u2019s work-related injury was only incidental to his psychological problems and that Slaughter falsely attributed his depression and disorder to the work injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-5\">The deputy commissioner found that \u201c[t]he experts\u2019 positions differ significantly only in that Dr. Shield opines that Slaughter\u2019s psychological disorder is causally related to his injury by accident on October 24, 1988; Dr. Brown opines that Slaughter\u2019s psychological disorder is not causally related to the same incident.\u201d Citing Dr. Brown\u2019s opinion that Slaughter falsely attributed his disorder to the work-related injury, the deputy commissioner ruled that Slaughter\u2019s psychological problems were not causally related to Slaughter\u2019s injury and denied any award for Slaughter\u2019s psychological problems. The deputy commissioner awarded Slaughter medical benefits only for treatment of the physical injury to his chest.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-6\">On review, the commission ruled that Dr. Shield was an authorized treating physician. Based on its analysis of the extensive psychological evidence, the commission found that Slaughter\u2019s work-related injury caused the psychological problems. Citing Dr. Shield\u2019s four-year treatment of Slaughter and his extensive reports, the commission found that his opinions and diagnoses were more persuasive than those of Dr. Brown and therefore awarded Slaughter compensation for psychological injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-8\">If a compensable work-related injury occurs and \u201cno panel of physicians is offered to the employee, he or she is free to select his own physician.\u201d <em>Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co. v. Pierce, </em>9 Va.App. 120, 128, 384 S.E.2d 333, 337-38 (1989). The uncontradicted evidence in the record establishes that Slaughter was not offered a panel of physicians. Moreover, we agree with the commission\u2019s ruling that the effect of Bassett\u2019s denial that a compensable injury occurred required Slaughter to seek <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>and pay for his own medical care. <em>Id. </em>at 128, 384 S.E.2d at 338. When Bassett denied liability, Slaughter \u201cwas entitled to choose his own physician.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 129, 384 S.E.2d at 338. Therefore, the commission properly ruled that Dr. Wittkamp and Dr. Shield were authorized treating physicians. <em>See id. </em>at 130, 384 S.E.2d at 339.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-4\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-5\">The commission\u2019s findings of fact, when supported by credible evidence, are binding on appeal. Code \u00a7 65.2-706(A); <em>Fairfax Hosp. v. DeLaFleur, </em>221 Va. 406, 410, 270 S.E.2d 720, 722 (1980). In awarding Slaughter compensation for psychological injuries, the commission found \u201cDr. Shield\u2019s opinions to be reasonable and consistent with the medical records.\u201d The commission also found that \u201cDr. Shield was intimately involved with [Slaughter\u2019s] treatment since April of 1989,\u201d that Dr. Shield consulted with numerous experts, and that Dr. Shield had considered his patient\u2019s medical history. When we examine the evidence in the light most favorable to Slaughter, the prevailing party below, <em>Odom v. Red Lobster, </em>20 Va.App. 228, 233, 456 S.E.2d 140, 142 (1995), we conclude that the commission\u2019s decision is supported by credible evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-6\">As the deputy commissioner noted, \u201c[b]oth Dr. Shield and Dr. Brown testified eloquently and at length regarding Slaughter\u2019s psychological disorders\u201d and they only \u201cdiffered in subtle ways in their diagnoses.\u201d Dr. Shield diagnosed Slaughter as having psychogenic pain syndrome, major depression, and dysthymic disorder. Dr. Shield testified that he had \u201cno objection\u201d to Dr. Brown\u2019s diagnosis that Slaughter had somatoform pain disorder. He farther testified</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AP1\">Well, I never diagnosed him as having that, and it\u2019s not in my records, you won\u2019t find it anywhere there. I have no disagreement with it because I was treating Mr. Slaughter for his depressive decompensation more than anything else, as a result of his pain syndrome. And I wasn\u2019t necessarily sending anybody a bill for treatment of somatoform pain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>syndrome, I was sending a bill for treating the devastating depressions that I think were secondary to that. I think the somatoform pain disorder is a good description, and I think dysthymic disorder, he\u2019s got in his report, is a good description, I think he left out the major depressive episode diagnosis that precipitated his hospitalizations. And so I have no diagnostic arguments.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b624-4\">In addition, however, Dr. Shield\u2019s testified that although Slaughter had psychiatric problems before the 1988 injury, \u201cthe October [1988] accident caused his psychiatric decompensation ... and the disability.\u201d Dr. Shield acknowledged that his opinion regarding causation differed from Dr. Brown\u2019s opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-5\">The commission aptly acknowledged and applied the principle that \u201cgreat weight should be given to the evidence of an attending physician.\u201d <em>C.D.S. Constr. Servs. v. Petrock, </em>218 Va. 1064, 1071, 243 S.E.2d 236, 241 (1978). The commission made the following findings that are well supported by credible evidence:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b624-6\">Although Dr. Brown worked over 100 hours developing his opinion in this case, Dr. Shield has been formulating his opinion on the basis of 4 years of personal treatment and with consultation of other medical experts____ We find Dr. Shield\u2019s opinions to be reasonable and consistent with the medical records, and they are more persuasive in this case. Although the employer argues that there were other stressors in [Slaughter\u2019s] life, the psychological and medical reports place overwhelming emphasis on the injury of October 1988 as the cause of [Slaughter\u2019s] depression. Dr. Brown\u2019s opinion that the injury at work was merely incidental to a disease which progressed on a natural path leading to his present disability is belied by the evidence that [Slaughter] was able to earn a livelihood and be a productive member of society despite his depression and psychosomatic symptoms until he began to unravel after the incident of October 24, 1988, following which he became virtually dysfunctional.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b625-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>The commission\u2019s findings, based upon Dr. Shield\u2019s reports, support the commission\u2019s conclusion that Slaughter\u2019s psychological disability was a compensable consequence of his injury by accident. <em>See Ohio Valley Constr. Co. v. Jackson, </em>230 Va. 56, 58, 334 S.E.2d 554, 555 (1985); <em>Seneca Falls Greenhouse &amp; Nursery v. Layton, </em>9 Va.App. 482, 485-86, 389 S.E.2d 184, 186-87 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b625-5\">For these reasons, we affirm the commission\u2019s award.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
