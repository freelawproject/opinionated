Defendant complains on appeal that the evidence was insufficient to establish that the victim, a Virginia Beach policeman employed as a part-time security guard at the time of the offense, was performing the duties of a law enforcement officer. Finding no error, we affirm the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>Under familiar principles of appellate review, we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, granting to it all reasonable inferences fairly deducible therefrom. <em>Traverso v. Commonwealth, </em>6 Va.App. 172, 176, 366 S.E.2d 719, 721 (1988). The findings of the trial court will not be disturbed unless \u201cplainly wrong,\u201d <em>Commonwealth v. Grimstead, </em>12 Va.App. 1066, 1067, 407 S.E.2d 47, 48 (1991), and the burden is upon the appellant to show reversible error. <em>Reynolds v. Commonwealth, </em>9 Va.App. 430, 436, 388 S.E.2d 659, 663 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">On the evening of January 23, 1994, Detective Douglas E. Zebley of the Virginia Beach Police Department was employed as a \u201cpart-time security\u201d guard at the Friendship Inn in Virginia Beach. Zebley was dressed in full police uniform, displaying his badge of authority and equipped with \u201cnormal duty gear,\u201d including a holstered sidearm and baton. At approximately 1:30 a.m., Zebley responded to a report of a \u201cperson asleep on the fifth floor\u201d of the hotel and discovered defendant sleeping on the floor adjacent to the elevator. Zebley woke defendant and noticed that his \u201ceyes were glassy,\u201d and he \u2018looked a little bit out of it.\u201d Using the wall for support, defendant \u201cstood up,\u201d and Zebley asked if he had \u201ca room at the hotel.\u201d Zebley also advised defendant that, without a room, he must leave the hotel or \u201cbe trespassing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b357-6\">Defendant did not respond to Zebley\u2019s inquiries and proceeded \u201cdown a corridor\u201d with no exits. Zebley placed hiis hand on defendant\u2019s shoulder and inquired, \u201cIs your room down there?\u201d Defendant then \u201cturned,\u201d answered, \u201cF_ this,\u201d and assumed \u201ca fighting position\u201d with \u201cclinched ... fists.\u201d As Zebley removed his baton from his \u201cduty belt,\u201d defendant struck him in the mouth with his right fist. Zebley then repeatedly hit defendant about the legs with the baton, instructing him \u201cto go to his knees,\u201d \u201cstop fighting,\u201d and advising that he was \u201cunder arrest.\u201d However, despite Zebley\u2019s commands, defendant\u2019s violent aggression persisted for \u201ceight to ten\u201d minutes, during which defendant bit Zebley <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>three times. Defendant continued to struggle until restrained by other police officers summoned to assist Zebley.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-5\">Code \u00a7 18.2-51.1 provides in pertinent part that [i]f any person unlawfully, but not maliciously ... causes bodily injury to another by any means, knowing or having reason to know such other person is a law-enforcement officer ... engaged in the performance of his public duties as a law-enforcement officer, he shall be guilty of a Class 6 felony....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b358-6\">Defendant does not challenge the sufficiency of the evidence to establish the requisite knowledge that Zebley was a law enforcement officer. Rather, he contends that, Zebley was acting as a privately employed security guard during the incident and, therefore, was not performing \u201cpublic duties as a law-enforcement officer.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-7\">Code \u00a7 15.1-133.1 provides, in pertinent part, that</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Al7\">[a]ny county, city or town may adopt an ordinance which permits law-enforcement officers and deputy sheriffs in such locality to engage in off-duty employment which may occasionally require the use of their police powers in the performance of such employment. Such ordinance may ... delegate the promulgation of ... reasonable rules and regulations [governing such activity] to the chief of the respective police departments....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b358-8\">Accordingly, \u00a7 27-2(c) of the Virginia Beach City Code expressly authorizes the chief of police to permit such \u201coff-duty employment,\u201d and police departmental \u201cGeneral Order\u201d 91.02 approves that activity. This policy comports with Code \u00a7 15.1-138, which requires that \u201c[e]ach policeman shall endeavor to prevent the commission ... of offenses against the law ...; shall detect and arrest offenders against the same; shall preserve good order ...; and shall secure the [populace] from violence and ... property ... from injury.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b358-9\">It is uncontroverted that Zebley initially approached the defendant in furtherance of his duties as a security guard for the hotel. Defendant was asleep in a hallway, \u201cglassy-eyed\u201d and \u201cout of it,\u201d did not respond to Zebley\u2019s inquiries and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>admonishments, and walked away from the officer. Such circumstances clearly provided articulable suspicion that defendant was committing a criminal trespass and justified further investigation by Zebley. Although Zebley encountered defendant while acting in a private capacity, he was fully empowered by his public office to pursue an investigation, detain defendant if necessary, and arrest if justified.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See DePriest v. Commonwealth, </em>4 Va.App. 577, 585, 359 S.E.2d 540, 544 (1987), <em>cert. denied, </em>488 U.S. 985, 109 S.Ct. 541, 102 L.Ed.2d 571 (1988). The coincidence of Zebley\u2019s private and public duties during the encounter did not eclipse his authority and responsibility as a law enforcement officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-4\">Zebley was, therefore, \u201cengaged in the performance of his public duties as a law-enforcement officer\u201d when attacked and unlawfully wounded by defendant. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b359-13\">. Defendant's argument on brief that he was unconstitutionally seized by Zebley was not presented to the trial court and will not be noticed on appeal. <em>Jacques </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>12 Va.App. 591, 593, 405 S.E.2d 630, 631 (1991) (citing Rule 5A:18).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
