Hayes appeals the trial court\u2019s equitable distribution decree, in which the trial court ruled that it lacked authority to order Douglas Hayes, appellee, to pay to Ann M. Hayes loans made by her to him. The trial court reasoned that the loans, made for the benefit of the husband\u2019s separate property, were separate as opposed to marital debts. The judge construed Code \u00a7 20-107.3(0 as not allowing the court to order repayment of non-marital debts of the parties. Because we hold that Code \u00a7 20-107.3(0 authorizes the court to order such payments, we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-15\">Code \u00a7 20-107.3(0 provides in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>The court shall also have the authority to apportion and order the payment of the debts of the parties, or either of them, that are incurred prior to the dissolution of the marriage, based upon the factors listed in subsection E.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Amm\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-5\">Code \u00a7 20-107.3(E) provides:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-6\">The amount of any division or transfer of jointly owned marital property, and the amount of any monetary award, the <em>apportionment of marital debts, </em>and the method of payment shall be determined by the court after consideration of the following factors:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-7\">1. The contributions, monetary and nonmonetary, of each party to the well-being of the family;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-8\">2. The contributions, monetary and nonmonetary, of each party in the acquisition and care and maintenance of such marital property of the parties;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-9\">3. The duration of the marriage;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-10\">4. The ages and physical and mental condition of the parties;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-11\">5. The circumstances and factors which contributed to the dissolution of the marriage, specifically including any ground for divorce under the provisions of subdivisions (1), (3), or (6) of \u00a7 20-91 or \u00a7 20-95;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-12\">6. How and when specific items of such marital property were acquired;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-13\">7. The debts and liabilities of each spouse, the basis for such debts and liabilities, and the property which may serve as security for such debts and liabilities;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-14\">8. The liquid or nonliquid character of all marital property;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-15\">9. The tax consequences to each party; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-16\">10. Such other factors as the court deems necessary or appropriate to consider in order to arrive at a fair and equitable monetary award.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b561-17\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b561-18\">The trial court construed the phrase \u201cdebts of the parties\u201d as used in Code \u00a7 20-107.3(C) to mean \u201cmarital debt,\u201d as used <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>in \u00a7 20-107.3(E), and defined \u201cmarital debt\u201d as \u201cthat debt incurred for the joint benefit of the parties during the marriage, rather than a loan benefiting just one party\u2019s separate property.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b562-5\">The language of Code \u00a7 20-107.3(0, and its command to consider the factors listed in Code \u00a7 20-107.3(E), does not restrict the judge\u2019s discretion to order payment of the parties\u2019 non-marital debts to each other. The first paragraph of subsection E states that it is limited to the apportionment of marital debt. However, \u00a7 20-107.3(C) does not invoke the first paragraph of Code \u00a7 20-107.3(E). The only part of subsection (E) that is invoked in Code \u00a7 20-107.3(C) is the list of the ten factors. Nothing in that list restricts the trial court\u2019s authority to order payment of non-marital debts between the parties as permitted in Code \u00a7 20-107.3(C).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b562-6\">The language of the statute is unambiguous: \u201cThe court shall also have the authority to apportion and order the payment of the debts of the parties, <em>or either of them\u201d </em>The term \u201cdebt\u201d is not limited. The authority to order payment of non-marital debt is only limited to the extent that the court must consider the factors in Code \u00a7 20-109.3(E) before ordering payment.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-7\">Furthermore, we conclude that the General Assembly intended that to the greatest extent possible, matters affecting the parties\u2019 estate be resolved in the divorce action. This is evidenced by the General Assembly\u2019s decision to amend Code \u00a7 20-107.3(C) to permit partition of marital property and to allow allocation of debt to the parties. Consistent with the General Assembly\u2019s intent, we interpret Code \u00a7 20-107.3(C) to authorize the court to require payment of non-marital debt owed by one party to the other.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>Here, it was necessary for the trial court to determine the parties\u2019 separate property. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 20-107.3(A). The court could not make that determination without first determining whether Mr. Hayes owed Mrs. Hayes the amount Mrs. Hayes claimed. Because evidence showed that Mr. Hayes borrowed the money from Mrs. Hayes to pay child support to his former spouse and to improve his separate property, the trial judge\u2019s finding that the debt was separate debt was not plainly wrong. Once it so found, the trial court should have decided whether to order Mr. Hayes to pay the debt, taking into consideration the factors specified in Code \u00a7 20-107.3(E).</p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">Therefore, we reverse the judgment and remand the case to the trial court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-6\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b562-8\">. We are not addressing payment of a non-marital debt owed to a nonparly. <em>See Woolley v.
