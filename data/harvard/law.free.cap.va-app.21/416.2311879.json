Appellant contends the evidence was insufficient to support the convictions. We hold the evidence was sufficient to support the conviction for the attempted murder of Anthony Fraierson and therefore affirm that conviction; we hold the evidence was insufficient to support the conviction for the second degree murder of Felicia Williams and therefore reverse that conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-14\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-15\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b463-16\">On August 31, 1993, appellant and Anthony Fraierson were involved in an argument and a fistfight in front of Fraierson\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>house on Edwards Avenue in Richmond. During the fight, Anthony Fraierson\u2019s brother struck appellant on the back of the head, which resulted in a bloody wound. After the fight, appellant immediately returned to his house, which was located on the same city block, and obtained a .45 caliber handgun. After leaving his house, appellant saw the Fraiersons outside of their house and approached Anthony Fraierson with his gun. Fraierson also had a gun. The distance between the parties was 256 feet. One eyewitness testified that appellant was the first to fire shots at Anthony Fraierson, while appellant and others testified that he returned gunfire only after he was first fired upon. Felicia Williams, a bystander who lived in a house between Fraierson and appellant, sustained a fatal gunshot wound in the head caused by a bullet from Anthony Fraierson\u2019s gun.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">In a bench trial on March 15, 1994, appellant was convicted of the second degree murder of Felicia Williams, the attempted murder of Anthony Fraierson, and two firearms charges.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b464-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-7\">EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT ATTEMPTED MURDER CONVICTION</p>\n<p id=\"b464-8\">Because there was sufficient evidence to support it, we affirm appellant\u2019s attempted murder conviction. We are guided by familiar standards of review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b464-9\">On appeal, we review the evidence in the light most . favorable to the Commonwealth, granting to it all reasonable inferences fairly deducible therefrom. The judgment of a trial court sitting without a jury is entitled to the same weight as a jury verdict and will not be set aside unless it appears from the evidence that the judgment is plainly wrong or without evidence to support it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b465-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number><em>Martin v. Commonwealth, </em>4 Va.App. 438, 443, 358 S.E.2d 415, 418 (1987) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">\u201cIntent is the purpose formed in a person\u2019s mind which may, and often must, be inferred from the facts and circumstances in a particular case.\u201d <em>Sandoval v. Commonwealth, </em>20 Va.App. 133, 137, 455 S.E.2d 730, 732 (1995). \u201cThe state of mind of an accused may be shown by his acts and conduct.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cThe fact finder may infer that a person intends the immediate, direct, and necessary consequences of his voluntary acts.\u201d <em>Bell v. Commonwealth, </em>11 Va.App. 530, 533, 399 S.E.2d 450, 452 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b465-6\">Viewed in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, the record shows appellant was injured in a fight with Fraierson and Fraierson\u2019s cohorts; appellant returned home after the fight and secured a high caliber gun; appellant fired bullets from the gun at Fraierson several times; and appellant fired first. Despite appellant\u2019s contentions, the Commonwealth was not required to prove that appellant directly threatened Fraierson. Based on the evidence before us, we cannot say that it was error for the trial court to have concluded beyond a reasonable doubt appellant attempted to murder Fraierson.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-8\">EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT MURDER CONVICTION</p>\n<p id=\"b465-9\">Second, we hold appellant was not guilty of second degree murder, as no existing common law theory supports his conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-10\">Appellant correctly asserts that our analysis is <em>not </em>governed by the theories of concert of action, transferred intent, or felony-murder. The concert of action theory states that where two or more people act in concert in the commission of a felony, \u201cand one felon shoots a person, that felon\u2019s intent is transferred and shared with the other felon as a principal in the second degree.\u201d <em>Berkeley v. Commonwealth, </em>19 Va.App. 279, 293, 451 S.E.2d 41, 48 (1994) (citing <em>Riddick v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number><em>Commonwealth, </em>226 Va. 244, 248, 308 S.E.2d 117, 119 (1983)). In this case, appellant and Fraierson were not co-felons who acted in concert; instead they acted in opposition to each other and did not share the same criminal goal.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">Similarly, the transferred intent theory is inapplicable here. This theory states that \u201cif an accused shoots at another intending to kill him, and a third person is killed because of the act, that same intent follows the bullet and is transferred to the killing of the third person, even if such death is accidental or unintentional.\u201d <em>Riddick, </em>226 Va. at 248, 308 S.E.2d at 119. In this ease, the innocent bystander was not killed by a bullet from appellant\u2019s gun.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-6\">Finally, the Commonwealth concedes that based on the Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>Wooden v. Commonwealth, </em>222 Va. 758, 762, 284 S.E.2d 811, 814 (1981), the felony-murder doctrine is inapplicable in this case. In <em>Wooden, </em>the defendant participated in the armed robbery of an apartment. Before the robbery, the defendant and her co-felons waited in the apartment for their victim\u2019s arrival. When the victim arrived, the victim shot and killed one of the defendant\u2019s co-felons, and the defendant was convicted of her co-felon\u2019s murder. The Supreme Court held under common law principles that a felon may <em>not </em>be convicted of the murder of a co-felon killed by the victim of the initial felony, there being no evidence of malice<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> imputable to the defendant when a co-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>felon is killed by the victim. Furthermore, the Court adopted the agency theory of felony murder, which provides that liability lies only where the act of killing is either actually or constructively committed by a felon or by someone acting in concert with him or in furtherance of a common design or purpose. <em>Id. </em>at 763-65, 284 S.E.2d at 814-16.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">In <em>Wooden, </em>the Supreme Court traced a line of Pennsylvania cases implicating the felony-murder and vicarious liability doctrines. The Court cited with approval <em>Commonwealth v. Redline, </em>391 Pa. 486, 137 A.2d 472 (1958), and <em>Commonwealth ex rel. Smith v. Myers, </em>438 Pa. 218, 261 A.2d 550 (1970), which overruled <em>Commonwealth v. Almeida, </em>362 Pa. 596, 68 A.2d 595 (1949) , <em>cert. denied, </em>340 U.S. 867, 71 S.Ct. 83, 95 L.Ed. 633 (1950) . In <em>Almeida, </em>the Pennsylvania Supreme Court had adopted the proximate cause theory of liability for felony-murder, affirming \u201cthe conviction of the defendant for the felony-murder of an innocent third party killed by the return fire of police officers.\u201d <em>Wooden, </em>222 Va. at 763, 284 S.E.2d at 814. In <em>Myers, </em>the court stated unequivocally that \u201c \u2018the decision in the <em>Almeida </em>case was a radical departure from common law criminal jurisprudence.\u2019 \u201d <em>Wooden, </em>222 Va. at 764, 284 S.E.2d at 815 (quoting <em>Myers, </em>438 Pa. at 224, 261 A.2d at 553). Adopting <em>Myers\u2019 </em>language in <em>Wooden, </em>the Virginia Supreme Court rejected any theory which would hold a defendant answerable for the death of his co-felon on a foreseeability-proximate cause concept of homicide responsibility. <em>Id; see also King v. Commonwealth, </em>6 Va.App. 351, 356, 368 S.E.2d 704, 707 (1988) (stating that for the felony-murder doctrine to be used to convict for murder, \u201c \u2018the killing must have been done by the defendant or an accomplice or confederate or by one acting in furtherance of the felonious undertaking\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b467-8\">We find that <em>Riddick v. Commonwealth, </em>226 Va. 244, 308 S.E.2d 117 (1983), a case cited by the Commonwealth, does not control this case. In <em>Riddick, </em>two co-participants initiated a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>gun battle in which an innocent bystander was shot <em>by a bullet from one of the co-participants\u2019 guns. </em>The Supreme Court employed both the transferred intent and concert of action theories in affirming the defendant\u2019s second degree murder conviction. The Court held that the transferred intent theory could apply if the <em>defendant </em>fired the fatal shot because his intent to kill the intended victim was transferred to the innocent bystander\u2019s death. The Court also held that the concert of action theory could apply if the <em>co-participant </em>fired the fatal shot because the co-participant\u2019s intent to kill the intended victim was transferred to the innocent bystander\u2019s death, and having acted in concert with the co-participant, the defendant was deemed to share his intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">The Commonwealth argues, however, the Supreme Court broadened these two concepts when it approved an instruction given by the trial court, which stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-6\">If you believe from the evidence that <em>two or more men were shooting guns in mutual combat </em>with the intent to kill and as a result of these shootings the deceased, an innocent bystander, was killed, then each is responsible for the death the same as if he had killed the person he intended to kill, unless he was acting in self defense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b468-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 249, 308 S.E.2d at 119 (emphasis added). Despite the Commonwealth\u2019s contention, we believe the <em>Riddick </em>Court clearly limited its approval of this instruction to the facts of the case and did not intend to broaden the concert of action and transferred intent theories. The Court specifically stated <em>\u201c[wjithout necessarily giving blanket approval </em>to this instruction for use in every case of this type, we conclude the trial court properly rejected defendant\u2019s ... objection to the instruction, <em>under the facts of this case. Id. </em>at 249, 308 S.E.2d at 120 (emphases added). Furthermore, in <em>Riddick, </em>unlike the instant case, the fatal bullet originated with one of the two co-participants, not a party in opposition to the defendant. <em>Riddick </em>is therefore inapposite.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-8\">The Commonwealth asks that we embrace the reasoning inherent in a line of cases originating in California, which has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>adopted a proximate cause theory to hold defendants guilty of second degree murder under circumstances similar to this case. The California line of cases, however, represents a distinct minority viewpoint. <em>See </em>40 Am.Jur.2d <em>Homicide </em>\u00a7 39 (1968 &amp; Supp.1995) (\u201cResponsibility for homicide by one not a participant\u201d). In <em>People v. Gilbert, </em>63 Cal.2d 690, 47 Cal.Rptr. 909, 917-18, 408 P.2d 365, 373-74 (1965), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>388 U.S. 263, 87 S.Ct. 1951, 18 L.Ed.2d 1178 (1967), the Supreme Court of California held that \u201c[w]hen the defendant ... with a conscious disregard for life, intentionally commits an act that is likely to cause death, and his victim or a police officer kills in reasonable response to such act, the defendant is guilty of murder.\u201d California courts call this doctrine of criminal liability the \u201cprovocative act murder\u201d theory. In a provocative act murder:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"An3\">neither the defendant nor his accomplices intend to kill the victim. Nor indeed do any of them pull the trigger. Instead it is a third person who actually fires the fatal bullet and it is one of the defendant\u2019s accomplices or occasionally an innocent bystander who ends up as the dead victim. To satisfy the \u201cactus reus\u201d element of this crime the defendant or one of his confederates must commit an act which provokes a third party into firing the fatal shot. To satisfy the \u201cmens rea\u201d element, the defendant or his confederate must know this act has a \u201chigh probability\u201d not merely a \u201cforeseeable probability\u201d of eliciting a life-threatening response from the third party.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b469-5\"><em>In re Aurelio R., </em>167 Cal.App.3d 52, 212 Cal.Rptr. 868, 870-71 (1985); <em>see also Alston v. State, </em>339 Md. 306, 662 A.2d 247 (1995) (affirming defendant\u2019s second degree murder conviction under analysis similar to that employed by California courts).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b470-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>Under similar facts, comparable statutes, and case law to that of Virginia, the appellate courts of only two states\u2014 California and Maryland\u2014have upheld murder convictions.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Other jurisdictions that have upheld such convictions have done so with the aid of statutes specifically addressing these facts<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> or under the proximate cause theory of the felony-murder rule\u2014the minority view\u2014which the Virginia Supreme Court rejected in <em>Wooden.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">We conclude the California and Maryland approaches are not anchored in any existing theory of common law murder in this state. Under Virginia case law, we adhere to a rule of causation in homicide cases that requires a direct causal connection for criminal liability to attach. Furthermore, Virginia statutory law provides no basis for broadening our common law rule of causal connection.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We are bound by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>the proximate cause analysis employed by the Supreme Court in <em>Wooden </em>in cases of second degree murder. As one Court expressly said in rejecting California\u2019s unique provocative act murder approach, \u201c[a] rose, the felon[y] murder rule, is still a rose by any other name, vicarious liability.\u201d <em>Sheriff, Clark County v. Hicks, </em>89 Nev. 78, 506 P.2d 766, 768 n. 7 (1973). The legislature, not this Court, is the appropriate forum in which to amend the felony-murder concept to provide for criminal liability under the facts of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">Accordingly, we affirm appellant\u2019s attempted murder conviction and the accompanying firearm conviction. However, we reverse and remand appellant\u2019s second degree murder conviction for further proceedings if the Commonwealth be so advised and reverse and dismiss the accompanying firearm conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-6\">\n<em>Affirmed in part, reversed and remanded in part and reversed and dismissed in part.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b464-10\">. In a separate trial, Anthony Fraierson was convicted of manslaughter in the death of Felicia Williams, the innocent bystander.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b466-7\">. <em>Malice </em>is the element distinguishing murder from manslaughter, <em>Moxley v. Commonwealth, </em>195 Va. 151, 157, 77 S.E.2d 389, 393 (1953), and is the element which the Commonwealth was required to prove beyond a reasonable doubt. Whether an accused acted with malice is generally a question to be decided by the fact finder. <em>Pugh v. Commonwealth, </em>223 Va. 663, 667, 292 S.E.2d 339, 341 (1982). Malice may be either express or implied by conduct. <em>Coleman v. Commonwealth, </em>184 Va. 197, 201, 35 S.E.2d 96, 97 (1945). \"Generally, implied malice is equivalent to \u2018constructive malice;\u2019 that is, 'malice as such does not exist but the law regards the circumstances of the act as so harmful that the law punishes the act as though malice did in fact exist.\u2019 \u201d <em>Pugh, </em>223 Va. at 668, 292 S.E.2d at 341 (quoting 1 <em>Wharton's Criminal Law and Procedure </em>\u00a7 245, at 529 (1957)).

Compare <em>Gallimore </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>246 Va. 441, 436 S.E.2d 421 (1993), where the defendant was convicted of involuntary manslaughter. In <em>Gallimore, </em>the defendant purposefully lied to a friend\u2019s husband, telling him that his wife, the defendant\u2019s friend, had been kidnapped by a third party. With the defendant present, the husband armed himself, and then located and accidentally killed the third party during a struggle. The Supreme Court affirmed the conviction, holding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>the defendant\u2019s \" 'conduct was a concurring, proximate cause of [the third party\u2019s death]\u2019 and that [the defendant] knew or should have known that the circumstances presented a \u2018dangerous risk of someone being shot or injured when [the husband] left the house to confront [the third party].\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 448, 436 S.E.2d at 426 (citation omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b470-7\">.
