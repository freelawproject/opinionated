Defendant complains on appeal that the trial court erroneously overruled his motion to withdraw his arraignment plea of not guilty and enter a guilty plea, following the jury\u2019s guilty verdict but prior to commencement of the sentencing phase of the proceedings. We disagree and affirm the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>The relevant procedural history is uncontroverted. Pursuant to Code \u00a7 19.2-295.1, a bifurcated trial commenced upon defendant\u2019s not guilty plea to the indictment and related request for a jury trial. At the conclusion of the guilt phase of the proceeding, the jury was correctly instructed that its initial determination embraced only guilt or innocence and that, upon a finding of guilty, the jury \u201cshall not fix the punishment until [that] <em>verdict </em>has been returned and further evidence is heard ...\u201d (emphasis added). The jury then retired to consider this threshold issue, returning shortly with a guilty verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-5\">Before beginning the sentencing phase of the trial, the court pronounced, in open court, its finding of \u201cguilty ... as charged in the indictment\u201d and \u201cformally enter[ed]\u201d the \u201cjury\u2019s verdict.\u201d The order which memorializes this ruling recites that \u201c[t]he court affirmed the jury\u2019s verdict, finding the defendant guilty....\u201d Thereafter, but before commencement of the sentencing phase, defendant moved \u201cfor leave to withdraw the plea of not guilty and enter a plea of guilty\u201d to the \u201cfull indictment of attempted capital murder,\u201d asserting both constitutional and statutory \u201centitle[ments]\u201d to the \u201cindependent judgment of the court upon the ... punishment to be inflicted, uninfluenced by the judgment or advice of the jury....\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Noting that defendant\u2019s guilt had been previously adjudicated by the jury, the trial court overruled the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-6\">The proceedings then reconvened to undertake the sentencing phase of the trial and, after instruction on those considerations appropriate to that issue and deliberation, the jury \u201creached a verdict\u201d which fixed defendant\u2019s punishment. On defendant\u2019s motion, the court delayed imposition of the sentence pending the preparation and consideration of a presentence report and, at a later hearing, sentenced defendant \u201c[i]n accordance with the jury\u2019s verdict.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b735-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>\n<em>THE BIFURCATED TRIAL</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b735-5\">Code \u00a7 19.2-295.1 mandates a bifurcated proceeding in all felony jury trials. The statute divides the trial into two distinct phases. The jury first resolves the issue of guilt or innocence and, \u201cupon a finding that the defendant is guilty ..., a <em>separate proceeding </em>limited to the ascertainment of punishment shall be held as soon as practicable before the same jury.\u201d Code \u00a7 19.2-295.1 (emphasis added). The procedure assures the jury access to \u201cinformation specific only to sentencing, apart from considerations of guilt or innocence,\u201d thereby promoting a punishment appropriate to the circumstances without corrupting the initial determination of guilt or innocence with prejudice. <em>Gilliam v. Commonwealth, </em>21 Va.App. 519, 525, 465 S.E.2d 592, 595 (1996); <em>see also Farmer v. Commonwealth, </em>10 Va.App. 175, 179, 390 S.E.2d 775, 776-77 (1990), <em>aff'd en banc, </em>12 Va.App. 337, 404 S.E.2d 371 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b735-6\">\n<em>THE VERDICT AND PLEA</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b735-7\">It is well established that a jury\u2019s verdict convicting a defendant, approved by the trial court, decides all material conflicts related to a defendant\u2019s guilt in favor of the Commonwealth, <em>Mitchell v. Commonwealth, </em>178 Va. 407, 410, 17 S.E.2d 370, 370-71 (1941) (citation omitted), and \u201cis conclusive upon that phase of the case.\u201d <em>Roanoke Ry. &amp; Elec. Co. v. Sterrett, </em>111 Va. 293, 295, 68 S.E. 998, 999 (1910); <em>see also Wood v. Commonwealth, </em>8 Va.App. 560, 563, 382 S.E.2d 306, 308 (1989) (citation omitted). Thus, a jury verdict of guilty emanating from the guilt phase of a bifurcated trial, approved by the trial court, resolves that issue, leaving sentence as the sole question remaining to be decided by an additional verdict incidental to a \u201cseparate proceeding.\u201d <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 19.2-295.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-8\">Here, the jury first returned a verdict finding defendant guilty of the subject offense. After the trial court accepted this verdict, both on the record and by order, and overruled defendant\u2019s motion to set it aside, the determination of defendant\u2019s guilt became conclusive, rendering his subsequent tender of a guilty plea irrelevant and moot. The trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>then advanced to the \u201cseparate proceeding\u201d to ascertain sentence, the only unresolved issue before the court, unaffected by defendant\u2019s intervening plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-5\">Defendant\u2019s reliance upon <em>Graham v. Commonwealth, </em>11 Va.App. 133, 397 S.E.2d 270 (1990), in support of a different result is misplaced. There, we considered the efficacy of a defendant\u2019s mid-trial guilty plea to the \u201cwhole indictment\u201d in the context of a unitary trial and concluded that \u201c[t]he fact that the trial has begun has no effect on a defendant\u2019s constitutional right to plead guilty.... We can find no limitations either under the Virginia Constitution, statute or Rules of Court which provide a time by which a defendant must enter his plea of guilty.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 141, 397 S.E.2d at 274-75; <em>see </em>Va. Const. Art. I, \u00a7 8; Code \u00a7\u00a7 19.2-254, -257; Rule 3A:8. \u201cA guilty plea \u2018is itself a conviction. Like a verdict of a jury it is conclusive. More is not required; the court has nothing to do but give judgment and sentence.\u2019 \u201d <em>Graham, </em>11 Va.App. at 141, 397 S.E.2d at 275 (quoting <em>Kercheval v. United States, </em>274 U.S. 220, 223, 47 S.Ct. 582, 583, 71 L.Ed. 1009 (1927)); <em>see also Miracle v. Peyton, </em>211 Va. 123, 126, 176 S.E.2d 339, 341 (1970); <em>Dixon v. Commonwealth, </em>161 Va. 1098, 1102, 172 S.E. 277, 278 (1934). We, therefore, held that \u201ca guilty plea may be tendered at any point <em>prior to a verdict being returned by the jury </em>\u201d with punishment then to be fixed by the court. <em>Graham, </em>11 Va.App. at 142, 397 S.E.2d at 275 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b736-6\">In contrast to the unitary trial in <em>Graham, </em>with its single verdict deciding both guilt and sentence in one proceeding, the bifurcated trial is comprised of two separate phases, each concerned with different issues and resolved by distinct verdicts. <em>See generally Gilliam, </em>21 Va.App. at 525, 465 S.E.2d at 595. Consistent with <em>Graham </em>and related authorities, a defendant may plead guilty at any time prior to the return of the jury\u2019s verdict concluding the guilt phase of a bifurcated trial. However, following publication of a guilty verdict and its acceptance by the trial court, a plea of guilty is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>untimely and may not upset the procedural course of a bifurcated trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-4\">Accordingly, we find that the trial court correctly declined to accept defendant\u2019s guilty plea and affirm the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b734-7\">. Defendant also moved the court to \"set aside the jury\u2019s verdict of guilty,\u201d arguing that it was without sufficient support in the evidence, an issue not before us on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
