The sole question in this appeal is whether the trial court erred in ruling that Code \u00a7 19.2-295.1 barred appellant from introducing evidence at the sentencing phase of his jury trial because the Commonwealth declined to introduce evidence. We hold that the trial court erred; accordingly, we reverse and remand for a new sentencing proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-8\">After the jury returned its verdicts finding appellant guilty of the charged offenses, the prosecutor advised the court that he had no evidence to introduce at the sentencing phase to be conducted pursuant to Code \u00a7 19.2-295.1.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Defense counsel stated that he intended to call appellant\u2019s mother to testify that appellant had been a \u201cgood upstanding citizen\u201d and a \u201cloyal and loving son.\u201d During the ensuing argument about whether Code \u00a7 19.2-295.1 permitted appellant to introduce evidence under the circumstances, appellant\u2019s counsel stated, \u201cWell, after you\u2019ve read the statute, it doesn\u2019t quite appear that we can, but we\u2019d like to.\u201d The trial court refused to permit appellant to introduce evidence, ruling that Code \u00a7 19.2-295.1 allowed a defendant to put on evidence only in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>rebuttal to the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence. Defense counsel noted his exception to this ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-4\">Appellant argues that the trial court misinterpreted Code \u00a7 19.2-295.1 as barring a defendant from introducing evidence at the sentencing phase unless the Commonwealth has put on evidence. The Commonwealth contends appellate review of the issue is procedurally barred because appellant acquiesced in the trial court\u2019s ruling. However, the record clearly shows that defense counsel placed the issue before the court and excepted to the adverse ruling. Counsel\u2019s comment concerning the relative strength of his position did not constitute an agreement with the court\u2019s decision. Thus, appellant\u2019s argument on appeal is not an attempt to \u201capprobate and reprobate.\u201d <em>See Fisher v. Commonwealth, </em>236 Va. 403, 417, 374 S.E.2d 46, 54 (1988), <em>cert. denied, </em>490 U.S. 1028, 109 S.Ct. 1766, 104 L.Ed.2d 201 (1989). Further, we find no merit to the Commonwealth\u2019s assertion that appellant\u2019s brief provides insufficient argument to support his position. <em>See </em>Rule 5A:20(e). Thus, we address on the merits the issue before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-5\">Code \u00a7 19.2-295.1 is a procedural statute, governing the ascertainment of punishment in a criminal jury trial. Statutes regarding criminal procedure generally are construed strictly against the Commonwealth. <em>See Bottoms v. Commonwealth, </em>20 Va.App. 466, 469, 457 S.E.2d 796, 797 (1995). <em>See also Gray v. Commonwealth, </em>220 Va. 943, 945, 265 S.E.2d 705, 706 (1980). Even so, \u201c[wjhere the language of the applicable statute is clear and unambiguous, the court \u2018must take the words as written and give them their plain meaning.\u2019 \u201d <em>Williams v. Commonwealth, </em>12 Va.App. 912, 920, 407 S.E.2d 319, 325 (1991) <em>(en banc).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b628-6\">\u201cAfter the Commonwealth has introduced such evidence of prior convictions, the defendant may introduce relevant, admissible evidence related to punishment.\u201d Code \u00a7 19.2-295.1. The Commonwealth construes this sentence to mean that the defendant is permitted to introduce evidence only if the Com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>monwealth has done so.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Instead of using the phrase \u201conly if\u2019 in the statute, however, the General Assembly chose the term \u201cafter.\u201d We presume that the legislature uses a nontechnical term such as \u201cafter\u201d in its ordinary sense. <em>See Petit Frere v. Commonwealth, </em>19 Va.App. 460, 465, 452 S.E.2d 682, 685 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b629-5\">The word \u201cafter\u201d means \u201clater than a particular time or period of time.\u201d <em>Suggs v. Life Insurance Co., </em>207 Va. 7, 11 n. *, 147 S.E.2d 707, 710 n. * (1966). So defined, the statutory language in question simply sets forth the order of proof at the sentencing proceeding. However, the language does not prohibit the defendant from introducing relevant, admissible evidence related to punishment if the Commonwealth chooses not to produce evidence of the defendant\u2019s prior convictions, or if the defendant has no criminal record that the Commonwealth can introduce.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-6\">This result is consistent with the sentence in Code \u00a7 19.2-295.1 that \u201c[njothing in this section shall prevent the Commonwealth or the defendant from introducing relevant, admissible evidence in rebuttal.\u201d \u201cWhenever possible, ... it is our duty to interpret the several parts of a statute as a consistent and harmonious whole so as to effectuate the legislative goal.\u201d <em>VEPCO v. Board of Supervisors, </em>226 Va. 382, 388, 309 S.E.2d 308, 311 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b629-7\">Following appellant\u2019s trial, Code \u00a7 19.2-295.1 was amended to permit a sentencing proceeding before a different jury if a defendant\u2019s sentence is reversed on appeal because of error in the original sentencing proceeding. \u201cThe general rule is that statutes are to be applied prospectively absent an express legislative provision to the contrary.\u201d <em>Wyatt v. Dep\u2019t of Social Services, </em>11 Va.App. 225, 228, 397 S.E.2d 412, 414 (1990). Rules of procedure, such as those contained in Code \u00a7 19.2-295.1, \u201care not protected from the effect of a repealing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>statute.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 229, 397 S.E.2d at 414. Accordingly, we reverse and remand the case for a new sentencing proceeding consistent with Code \u00a7 19.2-295.1, as amended. <em>See Evans v. Commonwealth, </em>228 Va. 468, 476-77, 323 S.E.2d 114, 119 (1984), <em>cert. denied, </em>471 U.S. 1025, 105 S.Ct. 2037, 85 L.Ed.2d 319 (1985) (where defendant\u2019s death sentence reversed because of error at sentencing proceeding, defendant properly resentenced by different jury as permitted by a statute enacted after his first trial and conviction).</p>\n<p id=\"b630-5\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b627-9\">. When appellant\u2019s trial began on January 10, 1995, Code \u00a7 19.2-295.1 stated that at a sentencing proceeding, \"the Commonwealth shall present the defendant's prior criminal convictions.... After the Commonwealth has introduced such evidence of prior convictions, the defendant may introduce relevant, admissible evidence related to punishment. Nothing in this section shall prevent the Commonwealth or the defendant from introducing relevant, admissible evidence in rebuttal.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b629-8\">. The General Assembly amended Code \u00a7 19.2-295.1, effective July 1, 1995, to state that a defendant is not precluded from introducing evidence even if the Commonwealth introduces no evidence.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
