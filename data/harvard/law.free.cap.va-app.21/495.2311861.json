Lawless was convicted of a misdemeanor and fined $1,000 under \u00a7\u00a7 21.1-5(b) and 21.1-8(c) of the Code of Chesterfield County for violating two conditions of a conditional use permit governing the operation of a landfill. The conditions that Lawless violated required him to cease all landfill activities and file a closure plan within thirty days because of exposed waste, leachate being discharged offsite, and inadequate buffer zones between the landfill and adjacent properties. Lawless contends on appeal that the trial court erred by refusing to sustain his motion to dismiss on the ground that he had been previously convicted of the same offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-7\">We hold that the provisions of \u00a7 21.1\u20145(b)(1) of the Chesterfield Code, which provides that each day\u2019s failure to comply with the conditional use permit constitutes a separate offense, violates Dillon\u2019s Rule. Therefore, Chesterfield County had no authority to adopt a provision in its zoning ordinance that each day\u2019s violation would be treated as a separate offense. Because Lawless had previously been convicted of a misdemean- or on the same facts for violating the conditions of the use permit, we hold that the trial court erred in not dismissing the charges. Thus, we reverse Lawless\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-8\">On July 25,1984, the Chesterfield County Board of Supervisors granted Lawless a conditional use permit to operate a landfill for a period of five years on 7.2 acres of real estate in Chesterfield County. The Board amended the permit on March 8, 1989, and set forth several conditions. Condition number one required Lawless to cease \u201call landfilling activity\u201d on the property. Condition number two required Lawless to file closure plans within thirty days of the Board\u2019s amendment to the permit. The amendment required Lawless to clean up <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>and close the landfill once the plans were submitted and approved.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-4\">In October 1992, Chesterfield County charged Lawless with violating \u00a7\u00a7 21.1-5(5) and 21.1-8(c) of the Chesterfield County Code, alleging failure to comply with conditions one and two of the March 1989 amendment to the special use permit. Lawless was convicted of a misdemeanor and fined for violating conditions one and two.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">In July 1993, on the same facts, the County again charged Lawless under \u00a7\u00a7 21.1\u20145(b) and 21.1-8(c) for violating conditions one and two of the March 1989 amendment. The dispositive issue is the validity of \u00a7 21.1-5(b) of the Chesterfield Code, providing that each day\u2019s violation is a separate offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">The only -witness at trial was Donna McClurg, a zoning inspector for Chesterfield County. McClurg testified that Lawless had not submitted the plan required under condition two within thirty days after the March 8, 1989, Board meeting and that the current charge was identical to the October 1992 charge on which Lawless had been convicted. She further testified that the landfill was in the same condition as it was in 1989 and that the only basis for the current charge was Lawless\u2019s failure to file closure plans within thirty days of the March 8, 1989, amendment to the permit.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-7\">Lawless submitted a written motion to dismiss. The trial court overruled the motion to dismiss, found Lawless guilty, and imposed a $1,000 fine.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-8\">Section 21.1\u20145(b)(1) of the Chesterfield County Code provides that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b542-9\">[a]ny person who violates any of the provisions of this chapter ... shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor and upon conviction thereof, shall be fined not less than ten dollars ($10.00) and not more than one thousand ($1,000.00). Each day such violation shall continue shall be a separate offense, and upon conviction thereof, shall be fined not less than ten dollars ($10.00) and not more than one thousand <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>($1,000.00) for each separate day on which [such] violation occurs.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">Lawless asserts that \u00a7 21.1-5(b), by providing that each day a violation exists constitutes a separate offense, exceeds the authority granted localities under Code \u00a7 15.1-491(e) to impose criminal penalties for zoning ordinance violations.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">In Virginia, the boards of supervisors of the counties do not have broad general authority to adopt whatever ordinance they deem appropriate or desirable. The power of a county, like that of a municipal corporation, is controlled by Dillon\u2019s Rule, which authorizes the locality to exercise those powers or adopt ordinances that the legislature expressly authorizes by statute or that are conferred by necessary implication. <em>Gordon v. Board of Supervisors of Fairfax County, </em>207 Va. 827, 832, 153 S.E.2d 270, 274 (1967). Dillon\u2019s Rule and its corollary provide that municipal and county governments have only those powers that the legislature expressly grants, those necessarily or fairly implied therefrom, and those that are essential and indispensable. <em>See id.; City of Richmond v. Board of Supervisors of Henrico County, </em>199 Va. 679, 684-85, 101 S.E.2d 641, 644-45 (1958). \u201c[T]he Dillon Rule is applicable to determine in the first instance, from express words or by implication, whether a power exists at all. If the power cannot be found, the inquiry is at an end.\u201d <em>Commonwealth v. County Board of Arlington County, </em>217 Va. 558, 575, 232 S.E.2d 30, 41 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b543-7\">We look to Title \u00a7 15.1 of the Code to determine whether the legislature, when it passed the enabling legislation that allowed localities to adopt zoning ordinances, empowered the counties, expressly or by necessary implication or as an essential power to enforce zoning ordinances, to prosecute an individual for a separate misdemeanor for each day\u2019s failure to comply. Code \u00a7 15.1-491(e) does not expressly grant such power to the locality.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-8\">We must determine, therefore, whether the power to make each day\u2019s violation a separate offense can be \u201cnecessarily or fairly implied\u201d from the express powers granted under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>the Code. <em>City of Richmond v. Confrere Club of Richmond, Virginia, Inc., </em>239 Va. 77, 79, 387 S.E.2d 471, 473 (1990). \u201cIf there is any reasonable doubt whether legislative power exists, that doubt must be resolved against the local governing body.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 79-80, 387 S.E.2d at 473.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-4\">Code \u00a7 15.1-491, the enabling legislation granting localities the power to enact zoning ordinances, sets forth a list of \u201cmatters\u201d upon which localities may adopt \u201creasonable regulations and provisions.\u201d With respect to enforcement, \u00a7 15.1-491 provides that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-5\">A zoning ordinance may include ... reasonable regulations and provisions</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-6\">(e) For the imposition of penalties upon conviction of any violation of the zoning ordinance. Any such violation shall be a misdemeanor punishable by a f\u00edne of not less than $10 nor more than $1,000.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b544-7\">Code \u00a7 15.1-491(e). Additionally, localities may enforce compliance with their zoning ordinances under Code \u00a7 15.1-491(d) by seeking injunctions, abatements, or other appropriate legal actions or proceedings. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 15.1-499.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-8\">In addition to the criminal sanctions and other means of enforcement, Code \u00a7 15.1-499.1 provides that localities may \u201cadopt an ordinance which establishes a uniform schedule of civil penalties for violations of specified provisions of the zoning ordinance.\u201d Significantly, Code \u00a7 15.1^499.1 expressly provides that localities may impose civil sanctions for specified continuing violations on a day-to-day basis, but limits the total amount of liability in each case to $3,000:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-9\">Each day during which the violation is found to have existed shall constitute a separate offense. However, specified violations arising from the same operative set of facts shall not be charged more frequently than once in any ten-day period, and a series of specified violations arising from the same operative set of facts shall not result in civil penalties which exceed a total of $3,000.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b545-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number><em>Id. </em>Furthermore, Code \u00a7 15.1-499.1 requires localities to elect between pursuing civil sanctions or criminal prosecution for particular violations.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-4\">Designation of a particular zoning ordinance violation for a civil penalty pursuant to this section shall be in lieu of criminal sanctions, and except for any violation resulting in injury to persons, <em>such designation shall preclude the prosecution of a violation as a criminal misdemeanor.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b545-5\"><em>Id. </em>(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b545-6\">Under the Chesterfield County Zoning Code, according to the position taken by Chesterfield County, the County may prosecute continuing zoning violations as separate misdemeanors and may impose fines up to $1000 for each day the violation continues. The Code contains no limitation upon the number of prosecutions the County can pursue or the cumulative amount of fines resulting from the prosecutions. Thus, the County argues that it may impose criminal sanctions for each day a violation exists, despite the Code\u2019s limitation on the frequency and cumulative amount of civil sanctions that may be imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-7\">We hold that Code \u00a7 15.1-491(e) does not authorize a locality to adopt a zoning ordinance that makes each day\u2019s violation a separate misdemeanor. \u201c[T]he primary objective of statutory construction is to ascertain and give effect to legislative intent. A related principle is that the plain, obvious, and rational meaning of a statute is always to be preferred to any curious, narrow or strained construction.\u201d <em>Turner v. Commonwealth, </em>226 Va. 456, 459, 309 S.E.2d 337, 338 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b545-8\">Code \u00a7 15.1-491(e) is silent on the issue whether each day\u2019s violation may be considered a separate misdemeanor. Thus, before Chesterfield County may include such a provision, the power to punish criminally for each day\u2019s violation must be necessarily or fairly implied from the enabling legislation, or it must be an essential and indispensable provision necessary to the enforcement of zoning ordinances.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>The General Assembly, in enacting Code \u00a7 15.1-491 (e), did not expressly grant to the locality the power to punish criminally each day\u2019s continuing violation of a zoning ordinance. We find that such power is neither necessarily implied by statute nor indispensable to the enforcement of a zoning code. In fact, by remaining silent on the issue of continuing criminal sanctions, while expressly authorizing civil sanctions for each day\u2019s violation, the Code evinces legislative intent to preclude treatment of each day\u2019s violation as a separate misdemeanor.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-4\">Moreover, to interpret Code \u00a7 15.1-491(e) to permit prosecution for each day\u2019s violation without limitation on the cumulative amount of fines would blur the distinction between Code \u00a7\u00a7 15.1^91(e) and 15.1-499.1 and would render meaningless the $3,000 and ten-day limitations on civil penalties under Code \u00a7 15.1-499.1. <em>See Shull v. Commonwealth, </em>16 Va.App. 667, 669, 431 S.E.2d 924, 925 (1993) (stating that a statute should not \u201cbe construed so that it leads to absurd results\u201d), <em>aff'd, 247 </em>Va. 161, 440 S.E.2d 133 (1994). We will not imply a grant of power from the legislature\u2019s silence. We will not imply a grant of power to punish more severely and more frequently for a criminal violation than for civil penalties, which the legislature has expressly limited. Furthermore, it is not essential or indispensable to a locality\u2019s ability to enforce compliance with its zoning code that the locality have the authority to make each day\u2019s continued violation a criminal offense. By providing in Code \u00a7 15.1^99 that a locality may \u201crestraint ], correct[ ], or abate[ ] as the case may be [a violation] by injunction or other appropriate proceeding,\u201d the locality has a broad range of enforcement options, including injunctions with contempt power and the authority to recover the costs of the locality\u2019s abatement of the problem. Thus, we hold that in enacting Code \u00a7 15.H91(e), the General Assembly did not intend to grant localities the power to prosecute criminally a zoning violation for each day the violation exists. <em>See Granny\u2019s Cottage, Inc. v. Town of Occoquan, </em>3 Va.App. 577, 583, 352 S.E.2d 10, 14 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">Accordingly, because Code \u00a7 15.H91(e) does not grant localities such power, that provision of \u00a7 21.1\u20145(b)(1) of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>Chesterfield County Code violates Dillon\u2019s Rule and is void. Because Lawless had previously been convicted on these same facts for a violation under \u00a7 21.1\u20145(b)(1), Lawless\u2019s conviction is reversed and dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">\n<em>Reversed and dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
