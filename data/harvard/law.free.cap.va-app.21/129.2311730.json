He contends that the evidence was insufficient to support the conviction. We agree and reverse the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">The evidence proved that at approximately 10 p.m. on November 6, 1993, Detrick Epps was involved in an accident while driving an automobile. At the hospital, Detective Faries interviewed two of the passengers in Epps\u2019 automobile and learned that twenty-one year old McCray had been a passenger in the automobile. Neither Epps nor McCray was at the scene of the accident when the police arrived to investigate.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-6\">Within five hours of the accident, Epps and his mother arrived at the police station. Epps then made a report of the accident. When Epps spoke to Detective Faries, he identified three passengers, including McCray, who had been in his automobile.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-7\">Lovain McCray, McCray\u2019s father, testified that McCray told him about the accident the night it occurred and asked for his assistance. Epps\u2019 mother also contacted McCray\u2019s father and told him to contact Detective Faries. McCray\u2019s father learned that Epps\u2019 mother had accompanied Epps to the station and that Epps had made a report of the accident. After speaking with his son and Epps\u2019 mother, McCray\u2019s father telephoned Detective Faries on the morning of November 7 and the next evening. McCray\u2019s father testified that the detective was not in and that he had not left any messages.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-8\">Code \u00a7 46.2-895 imposes the following duty to report accidents:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-9\">If the driver fails to stop and make the report required by [Code] \u00a7 46.2-894, every person sixteen years of age or older in the vehicle with the driver at the time of the accident, who has knowledge of the accident, shall have a duty to ensure that a report is made within twenty-four hours from the time of the accident to the State Police or, if the accident occurs in a city or town, to the local law-enforcement agency. The report shall include his name, address, and such other information within his knowledge as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>the driver is required to report pursuant to [Code] \u00a7 46.2-894.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b176-5\">The evidence does not establish that the driver left the accident before McCray or that McCray knew that the driver left. The evidence also failed to establish the circumstances existing when McCray or the driver left the scene of the accident. However, the evidence proved that the driver contacted the police within five hours of the accident and made a full report.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-6\">The evidence also established that McCray requested assistance from his father. In rendering assistance, McCray\u2019s father learned that Epps went to the police within five hours and made a full report. Although McCray\u2019s father learned that the driver had made a full report to the investigating detective, he twice attempted to contact the detective.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-7\">On this evidence, the Commonwealth failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that McCray did not \u201censure\u201d that a report was made. No evidence proved that the driver\u2019s report, which was made within twenty-four hours of the accident, was deficient. The statute does not require that the person make a report personally. Accordingly, the conviction is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-8\">\n<em>Reversed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
