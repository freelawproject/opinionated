(Rocco), filed an application for benefits claiming that her carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) and right ring trigger finger conditions constitute occupational diseases. The commission found that her CTS was a compensable occupational disease. However, because she had lost no time from work due to her CTS, the commission only awarded her medical benefits. Rocco appeals the commission\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-12\">Rocco contends that when CTS results from repetitive motion or cumulative trauma, it is not a disease as contemplated in the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act (Act) and that the commission\u2019s decision conflicts with the Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>Merillat Industries, Inc. v. Parks, </em>246 Va. 429, 433-34, 436 S.E.2d 600, 601-02 (1993). Rocco asserts that under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number><em>Merillat, </em>an ailment or condition resulting from the cumulative effects of repetitive motion or overuse, such as CTS, is a gradually incurred injury and cannot qualify as a disease.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-4\">We hold, however, that CTS may qualify as a disease, depending upon its pathology or how it develops. <em>See Perdue Farms, Inc. v. McCutchan, </em>21 Va.App. 65, 461 S.E.2d 431 (1995). CTS, which is a condition that exhibits a characteristic set of symptoms caused by compression of the median nerve in the carpal tunnel, will qualify as a disease when it develops as the body\u2019s response to environmental factors, infective agents, or inherent defects of the body. CTS may be caused by a number of precipitating factors or events, such as repetitive motion, cumulative trauma, obesity, rubella, pregnancy, rheumatoid arthritis, gout, and hypothyroidism, or a traumatic injury. 2 <em>Cecil Textbook of Medicine </em>1563 (19th ed.1992). Thus, a claimant\u2019s CTS may be a disease depending on how it develops. The Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Merillat </em>does not preclude this holding. Accordingly, because the evidence supports the commission\u2019s finding that the claimant\u2019s CTS developed as a condition or impairment in response to repetitive overuse and cumulative trauma, its pathology and ideology are consistent with the definition of disease; therefore, we affirm the commission\u2019s finding that claimant\u2019s CTS was a compensable occupational disease.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b551-6\">The claimant started working for Rocco in the spring of 1993. Her responsibilities included skinning turkey wings, which required her to make repetitive up and down motions with her right hand. After two or three weeks at Rocco, the claimant experienced problems with her right hand. Dr. Richard W. Lord, Jr. examined the claimant on May 22, 1993, and diagnosed her as having tendinitis of the hand secondary to overuse. He noted that the claimant exhibited no symptoms of CTS at the time.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-7\">Rocco laid off the claimant on June 23, 1993. Dr. Lord examined her again on August 4, 1993, and noted that a joint <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>on one of her fingers appeared to be slipping out of place. He referred the claimant to Dr. G. Edward Chappell, Jr., an orthopedist, who examined her on August 23, 1993. Dr. Chappell stated that he believed the claimant suffered from \u201ccarpal tunnel syndrome and triggering of the right ring finger,\u201d and he arranged for further testing. Nerve conduction studies \u201cshowed probable mild right carpal tunnel syndrome on electrical grounds.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b552-4\">Dr. Chappell reported that, in his opinion, the repetitive nature of the claimant\u2019s job at Rocco caused her CTS and trigger finger condition. When asked whether the condition would, in medical terminology, be considered a disease related to the claimant\u2019s occupation, Dr. Chappell stated, \u201cIt can be a disease of ordinary life. It can be caused by the occupation she stated she did.\u201d Dr. Chappell, in response to questions from the employer\u2019s counsel, stated that the claimant\u2019s condition was likely a result of cumulative trauma. Dr. Chappell did not place the claimant under work restrictions. Dr. Chappell later reported that the condition \u201ccould be a disease of ordinary life, but most likely cumulative trauma.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b552-6\">Code \u00a7 65.2-400(A) provides that \u201cthe term \u2018occupational disease\u2019 means a disease arising out of and in the course of employment.\u201d In <em>Merillat, </em>the Supreme Court reiterated that the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act \u201crequires that the condition for which compensation is sought as an occupational disease must first qualify as a disease.\u201d 246 Va. at 432, 436 S.E.2d at 601. In response to <em>Merillat, </em>this Court defined \u201cdisease\u201d as \u201c \u2018any deviation from or interruption of the normal structure or function of any part, organ, or system (or combination thereof) of the body that is manifested by a characteristic set of symptoms and signs and whose etiology, pathology, and prognosis may be known or unknown.\u2019 \u201d <em>Piedmont Mfg. Co. v. East, </em>17 Va.App. <em>499, 503, 438 </em>S.E.2d 769, 772 (1993) (quoting <em>Sloane-Dorland Ann. Medical-Legal Dictionary </em>209 (1987)). Subsequently, we noted in <em>Commonwealth/Department of State Police v. Haga, </em>18 Va.App. 162, 166, 442 S.E.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>424, 426 (1994), that the commission had previously employed a similar and consistent definition of disease to that which we recognized in <em>Piedmont.</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b553-4\">In <em>Haga, </em>the commission employed the definition: Disease is an impairment of the normal state of the living body or any of its components that interrupts or modifies the vital functions, being a response to environmental factors (as malnutrition, industrial hazards or climate), to specific infective agents as worms, bacteria or viruses), to inherent defects of the organisms (as various genetic anomalies), or to combinations of these factors.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">18 Va.App. at 164, 442 S.E.2d at 425 (quoting <em>Fletcher v. TAD Technical Servs. Corp., </em>VWC 150-41-13 (March 12, 1992)). \u201cThe construction afforded a statute by the public officials charged with its administration and enforcement is entitled to be given great weight by a court.\u201d <em>Haga, </em>18 Va.App. at 165, 442 S.E.2d at 425.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-6\">Applying the <em>Piedmont </em>definition, we subsequently held that CTS qualified as a disease in two cases where CTS had afflicted separate employees. In one case the employee\u2019s bilateral CTS was caused by \u201csustained motion\u201d on the assembly line packing chicken nuggets for several weeks. In the other case, the employee\u2019s CTS was caused by repetitive motion and overuse in having to flex her hands and wrists for approximately eight months on an automotive assembly line. <em>Perdue Farms, </em>21 Va.App. at 69, 461 S.E.2d at 433.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-7\">Rocco contends that the proper definition of the term \u201cdisease\u201d as embodied in the Act is more narrow than the definition we used in <em>Piedmont </em>and applied in <em>Perdue, </em>and that by adopting such a broad definition, we disregarded the Supreme Court\u2019s directive in <em>Merillat </em>that \u201c[a] definition of either \u2018injury\u2019 or \u2018disease\u2019 [should not be] so broad as to encompass any bodily ailment of whatever origin ... because it would make unnecessary and meaningless the two categories.\u201d <em>Merillat, </em>246 Va. at 433, 436 S.E.2d at 602 (quoting <em>Holly Farms v. Yancey, </em>228 Va. 337, 340-41, 321 S.E.2d 298, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>300 (1984)); <em>see also Perdue Farms, </em>21 Va.App. at 74, 461 S.E.2d at 437 (Koontz, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b554-5\">We believe the definition of \u201cdisease\u201d in <em>Piedmont </em>is consistent with the conventional understanding of that term and preserves the distinction between \u201cinjury\u201d and \u201cdisease\u201d that the Act steadfastly maintains. Moreover, the principle of <em>stare decisis </em>requires adherence to the definition of disease set forth in <em>Piedmont </em>and as applied by this Court to CTS in <em>Perdue Farms. See Commonwealth v. Burns, </em>240 Va. 171, 174, 395 S.E.2d 456, 457 (1990). Nevertheless, were we required to apply a narrower definition of the term \u201cdisease,\u201d or one similar to that proposed in the <em>Perdue </em>dissent,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the claimant\u2019s CTS would still qualify as a disease.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-6\">We do not read <em>Merillat </em>to hold that, under the Act, all conditions that are gradually incurred from repetitive motion or cumulative trauma are injuries, rather than diseases. In fact, many of the conditions that are unquestionably classified as diseases under the Act are gradually incurred conditions that result from cumulative effects of exposure to various causative factors, including such diseases as asbestosis, pneumoconiosis, byssinoses, and histoplasmosis. Similarly, when the cumulative effects of exposure to repetitive motion or cumulative trauma cause the body to react in such a way that a condition develops with a commonly recognized set of symptoms that is, according to conventional understanding, consid<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>ered a disease, then the condition is a disease as defined by the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-4\">We agree that whether a particular condition qualifies as a disease under the Act does not solely \u201cturn on whether a particular treating physician labels a condition as a \u2018disease\u2019 or an \u2018injury.\u2019 \u201d <em>Perdue Farms, </em>21 Va.App. at 76, 461 S.E.2d at 437 (Koontz, J., dissenting). Nevertheless, a medical diagnosis of \u201cdisease\u201d is a fact that the commission may consider in determining whether a condition is a disease. Ultimately, however, whether a condition is a disease under the Act depends upon how the condition develops pathologically and what causes the condition to develop. The commission may determine the pathology of the condition or its causes either from the evidence before it or by its reference to accepted medical authority. Thus, in determining whether a claimant\u2019s CTS qualifies as a disease, the commission must consider whether, based upon the evidence before it or its reliance upon recognized medical authority, the claimant\u2019s condition is one that has developed as a disease within the foregoing definition.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\">Even were we to accept the employer\u2019s argument that our definition of disease is overly broad, nevertheless, claimant\u2019s CTS would qualify as a disease under a more narrow and stringent definition. \u201cWhen the proper construction of a law is not clear from the words of a statute,\u201d we look to the legislative history to discern the statutory intent. <em>Ambrogi v. Koontz, </em>224 Va. 381, 386-87, 297 S.E.2d 660, 663 (1982). Although the Act does not expressly define disease or state whether CTS is a disease under either Code \u00a7\u00a7 65.2-400 or -401, the legislative history of the occupational disease statutes demonstrates that the legislature in 1970 intended to expand the definition of disease to include such tendon-sheath disorders as tenosynovitis, which includes CTS.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-6\">The predecessor to Code \u00a7 65.2-400 provided a schedule of occupational diseases, and a condition was not compensable as a disease under the Act unless it was listed in this schedule. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 65.1-47 (repealed 1970). In 1969, a General <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>Assembly study committee recommended eliminating the schedule of diseases. Report of the Virginia Advisory Legislative Council, <em>Matters Pertinent to the Industrial Commission of Virginia and Workmen\u2019s Compensation Laws of Virginia, </em>Va.H.Doc. No. 17, at 6 (1969). The committee\u2019s recommendation was based on its finding that the schedule of conditions considered to be diseases was too restrictive.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-5\">The schedule of occupational diseases as set out in \u00a7 65.1-47 attempts to be all-inclusive. However, the only possible effect the schedule can have is to eliminate a disease which may in fact be an occupational disease---<em>The elimination of the schedule insures the most comprehensive coverage of occupational diseases; </em>yet the employer is not prejudiced because the disease must in fact be an occupational disease, arising out of and in the course of employment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b556-8\"><em>Id. </em>(emphasis added). The General Assembly accepted this recommendation and repealed the schedule of occupational diseases, leaving in its place the current statutory scheme. 1970 Va.Acts. 470.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-9\">Beginning in 1958 and continuing until the legislature eliminated the schedule of occupational diseases in 1970, the schedule included tenosynovitis.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>See </em>1958 Va.Acts 457. Tenosynovitis, like CTS, is a type of tendon-sheath disorder and is \u201cusually caused by the constant repetition of stereotype movements.\u201d David F. Tver <em>&amp; </em>Kenneth A. Anderson, <em>Industrial Medicine Desk Reference </em>282 (1986); <em>see also Lamberson v. Phillips Oldsmobile, Inc., </em>63 O.I.C. 212, 214 (1984) (noting that CTS is \u201cknown as tendinitis or tenosynovitis in the area of the median nerve and the carpal tunnel\u201d). Thus, the schedule of diseases, which was the precursor to the current statutory scheme, was not limited to \u201cdiseases caused by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>infectious biological agents\u201d or conditions caused by exposure only to chemical or biological environmental hazards, <em>see Perdue Farms, </em>21 Va.App. at 77, 461 S.E.2d at 437 (Koontz, J., dissenting). The schedule that the legislature discarded as being too restrictive included a cumulative trauma condition resulting from repetitive motion. We, therefore, cannot conclude that the legislature intended Code \u00a7\u00a7 65.2-400 and -401 to depart in such a significant manner from their statutory predecessors as to limit or exempt CTS from coverage under the Act. When the General Assembly eliminated the schedule of diseases in order to expand, rather than restrict, the coverage of the Act, it clearly expressed its intention. Accordingly, we conclude that in enacting the current statutory scheme, the legislature intended that CTS, when it develops gradually as the body\u2019s response to overuse or cumulative motion, be treated as a disease.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-5\">The case law of this Court and the Supreme Court is consistent with this conclusion. This Court has expressly found that CTS, de Quervain\u2019s disease, and tendinitis, all types of tendon-sheath disorders related to tenosynovitis, may be diseases under Code \u00a7 65.2-400. <em>Perdue Farms, </em>21 Va.App. at 69, 461 S.E.2d at 433 (CTS); <em>Piedmont, </em>17 Va.App. at 504, 438 S.E.2d at 772 (de Quervain\u2019s); <em>The Greif Companies v. Sipe, </em>16 Va.App. 709, 714, 434 S.E.2d 314, 317 (1993) (tendinitis). Moreover, the Supreme Court has acknowledged the commission\u2019s finding that tenosynovitis may be a disease. <em>See Western Elec. Co. v. Gilliam, </em>229 Va. 245, 247, 329 S.E.2d 13, 14 (1985) (holding that \u201c[f]or purposes of this opinion, we accept the Commission\u2019s factual finding that tenosynovitis is a disease\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b557-6\">These decisions do not conflict with <em>Merillat </em>or with <em>Holly Farms v. Yancey, </em>228 Va. 337, 340, 321 S.E.2d 298, 300 (1984), in which the Supreme Court held, respectively, that rotator cuff tears and back strains were not diseases, but rather, were gradually incurred injuries. Although the rotator cuff tear at issue in <em>Merillat </em>was found to have been an injury that resulted from repetitive motion, a tear, like a break, sprain, or strain, involves \u201cmechanical or structural changes in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>body.\u201d Tendon sheath disorders, such as CTS, tendinitis, tenosynovitis, and de Quervain\u2019s disease, caused by <em>\u201crepeated </em>strain or trauma,\u201d involve inflamed or irritated tissue, Tver &amp; Anderson, <em>Industrial Medicine Desk Reference </em>282 (1986) (emphasis added), which is a significant factor in determining how the condition pathologically develops.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-5\">We reaffirm our holdings that CTS resulting from repetitive motion or cumulative trauma is a disease and may be compensable as an occupational disease or an ordinary disease of life under the Act. Because the only issue before us on appeal is whether the claimant\u2019s CTS is a disease, we do not address whether CTS can be compensable as an occupational disease under Code \u00a7 65.2-400 or whether it must qualify as a compensable ordinary disease of life under Code \u00a7 65.2-401. Accordingly, we affirm the commission\u2019s award.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b554-7\">. Judge Koontz, in construing <em>Merillat, </em>expressed the view, in dissent, that disease \"does not include conditions of cumulative trauma resulting from repetitive motion\u201d and that disease \"should include all diseases caused by infectious biological agents where the illness is contracted as a result of exposure uncommon to ordinary life,\u201d and \"should include specifically enumerated conditions resulting from occupational exposure to poisons, chemicals, fumes, dusts, spores, radiation and other environmental hazards.\u201d <em>Perdue Farms, </em>21 Va.App. at 77, 461 S.E.2d at 437.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-8\">We do not understand Judge Koontz to have suggested an all inclusive definition of what is a disease, but rather to have recognized a nonexclusive set of factors or agents that are common in the workplace and commonly known to cause conditions that are generally recognized as diseases, from which list he would expressly exclude \"exposure\u201d to cumulative trauma and repetitive motion.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b556-10\">. The General Assembly first enacted an occupational disease schedule in 1944, and this schedule did not include tenosynovitis. 1944 Va.Acts. 77. In 1952, the legislature repealed the occupational disease schedule. 1952 Va.Acts 565.
