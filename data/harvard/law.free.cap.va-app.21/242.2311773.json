Branch contends (1) the ABC Board lacked authority to revoke the licenses as a sanction for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>his violations after he voluntarily surrendered the licenses; (2) the ABC Board failed to conduct a <em>de novo </em>hearing after the trial court vacated the revocations and remanded his case; (3) insufficient evidence supported the charge that the operation of his business resulted in breaches of peace and good order; and (4) he substantially prevailed on appeal to the trial court and was therefore entitled to an award of attorney\u2019s fees and costs. Because the trial court committed no error, we affirm its decision to uphold the ABC Board\u2019s revocations.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b289-6\">On July 26, 1993, the ABC Board gave Branch notice of charges of violations of state alcohol beverage control laws, which concerned his licenses for (1) mixed beverages <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and (2) wine and beer<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> at his establishment, Ivory\u2019s Restaurant.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-7\">On January 5 and 7, 1994, an ABC Board hearing officer received testimony from Branch, Branch\u2019s employees and bookkeeper, ABC agents, and local police officers. At the hearing, Branch objected to the introduction of a television news videotape, which depicted various incidents of violence occurring near Ivory\u2019s. The hearing officer offered to make the video available to Branch\u2019s counsel, but the record does not disclose whether Branch\u2019s counsel availed himself of the opportunity. On January 27, 1994, the hearing officer found Branch violated ABC laws and recommended the revocation of both licenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>On April 5, 1994, the case was heard before the full ABC Board, and Branch presented testimony and additional evidence. Branch did not object to the hearing officer\u2019s handling of the video or the other evidence relating to the peace and good order charge. On April 6,1994, the ABC Board revoked both licenses, and Branch appealed to the Richmond Circuit Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-4\">On July 13, 1994, the Honorable Randall G. Johnson affirmed the hearing officer\u2019s factual findings, but found that the hearing officer improperly admitted the videotape. The trial court stated that (1) the videotape was not so crucial to the ABC Board\u2019s final decision that the entire process must be thrown out; (2) only a remand could answer what the hearing officer or the ABC Board would have found if the videotape had not been admitted; and (3) the Board could \u201cnot base its decision and orders on remand on any evidence related to the subject videotape, unless the case is further remanded to the hearing officer to allow Branch to present evidence in rebuttal to it.\u201d The trial court therefore vacated the revocations and remanded the case to the ABC Board. The trial court refused to award Branch attorney\u2019s fees and costs, as he had not substantially prevailed on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">Branch filed a motion with the trial court requesting it to amend or modify its July 13, 1994 order, which had not ordered a <em>de novo </em>hearing on remand. The trial court refused to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-6\">On remand, the ABC Board vacated the two April 6, 1994 final orders of revocation and scheduled a hearing for the appeal. On August 1, 1994, Branch objected to the ABC Board hearing his case without affording him a <em>de novo </em>hearing before an officer. Immediately prior to the final August 23, 1994 ABC Board hearing, Branch voluntarily surrendered his licenses (which were to expire on September 30, 1994) and claimed that the ABC Board could take no further action against him. On September 6, 1994, the ABC Board issued orders revoking Branch\u2019s licenses. On December 13, 1994, the trial court affirmed the ABC Board\u2019s revocations and dismissed Branch\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-4\">REVOCATION SUBSEQUENT TO VOLUNTARY SURRENDER</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">In his brief to the Court, Branch argued that once he voluntarily surrendered his two licenses prior to the ABC Board hearing, the ABC Board lacked the right to revoke the licenses on September 6, 1994, thereby affecting what was already a final termination. Branch relied on Code \u00a7 4.1-203(D), which states in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-6\">The privileges conferred by any license granted by the Board ... shall continue [for a designated period of time, which in this case was September 30, 1994], except that the license <em>may be sooner terminated </em>for any cause for which the Board would be entitled to refuse to grant a license, by operation of law, <em>voluntary surrender </em>[,] or order of the Board.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b291-7\">(Emphasis added). However, at oral argument, Branch conceded that the voluntary surrender of an alcohol license does <em>not </em>bar further revocation and sanction proceedings and conceded that such proceedings may affect a licensee\u2019s chances of being granted an alcohol license in the future. <em>See </em>48 C.J.S. <em>Intoxicating Liquors </em>\u00a7 171 at 613 (1981 <em>&amp; </em>Supp.1995). Because of this concession we need not exhaustively address this issue. We merely note that the ABC Board began its proceedings before Branch attempted to surrender his licenses. Nothing in the statute forbids the ABC Board from continuing an enforcement action simply because a licensee unilaterally seeks to preclude an adverse finding by surrender of the license after proceedings commenced. We hold the ABC Board retained authority to revoke Branch\u2019s licenses after he voluntarily surrendered them.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-8\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-9\">LACK OF <em>DE NOVO </em>HEARING ON REMAND</p>\n<p id=\"b291-10\">We uphold the trial court\u2019s ruling that Branch had no absolute right to a <em>de novo </em>hearing before a hearing officer on remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>The basic law under which the legislature empowered the ABC Board to act contains no requirement that the case be remanded to the hearing officer. The law authorizes the Board to promulgate reasonable regulations necessary to carry out the provisions of the basic law. Code \u00a7 4.1-111(A). The Code also provides that \u201c[t]he Board\u2019s power to regulate shall be broadly construed.\u201d Code \u00a7 4.1-111(F).</p>\n<p id=\"b292-4\">The Regulations of the Virginia Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control, which include the Rules of Practice Before Hearing Officers and the ABC Board, also guide our determination. Part II of the Rules, concerning hearings before the ABC Board, includes VR125-01-1 \u00a7 2.6 (Evidence), which grants the ABC Board certain powers. Section 2.6(B) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-5\">Should the Board determine at an appeal hearing, either upon motion or otherwise, that it is necessary or desirable that additional evidence be taken, the board may:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-8\">1. Direct that a hearing officer fix a time and place for the taking of such evidence ... and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-9\">2. Upon unanimous agreement of the board members, <em>permit the introduction of after-discovered or new evidence at [an] appeal hearing.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-10\">(Emphasis added). This section provides an explicit exception to the general rule that all evidence should be introduced at a hearing before a hearing officer. VR125-01-1 \u00a7 2.6(A). Because the ABC Board may permit new evidence to be admitted after the hearing officer receives evidence and makes a recommendation, it follows that the ABC Board had the authority to exclude the videotape from its consideration on remand.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b292-11\">VR125-01-1 \u00a7 1.7 (Decisions) also supports the conclusion that the ABC Board was under no duty to instruct the hearing officer to make new findings of fact on remand, without the use of the videotape. VR125-01-1 \u00a7 1.7 states:</p>\n<p id=\"b293-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>A. <em>Initial </em>decisions.\u2014The decision of the hearing officer shall be deemed the <em>initial decision, </em>shall be a part of the record and shall include:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-4\">1. A statement of the hearing officer\u2019s findings of fact and conclusions, as well as the reasons or bases therefor, upon all the material issues of fact, law Or discretion presented on the record; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-5\">2. The appropriate rule, order, sanction, relief or denial thereof as to each such issue.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b293-7\">Additionally, in rendering its decision, the ABC Board \u201cmay adopt, modify or reject the initial decision.\u201d \u00a7 1.7(F). The ABC Board also has the authority at its hearing to \u201cexamine a witness upon any question relevant to the matters in issue.\u201d \u00a7 2.6(C). These powers implicitly give the ABC Board the authority to conduct a <em>de novo </em>review after the initial decision has been rendered and are sufficiently broad to allow the ABC Board to reconsider the case on remand from the circuit court without the necessity to remand for another proceeding before the hearing officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-8\">The trial court\u2019s July 13, 1994 order, which specifically dealt with the remand issue, distinguished this case from <em>Virginia Bd. of Medicine v. Fetta, </em>244 Va. 276, 421 S.E.2d 410 (1992), a case on which Branch relies. In <em>Fetta, </em>the Supreme Court held that the Virginia Board of Medicine violated statutory provisions relating to the conduct of its proceedings. The Court affirmed the trial court\u2019s ruling that, because the violation could have had an impact on the medical board\u2019s ultimate decision, the proceeding could not be fairly reheard on remand and had to be dismissed. <em>Id. </em>at 283, 421 S.E.2d at 414. In this ease, the trial court wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-9\">Here, the only error found in the agency\u2019s proceedings concerns a videotape. There is nothing about that tape, or the hearing officer\u2019s or Board\u2019s consideration of it, which is <em>per se </em>so crucial or central to the Board\u2019s final decision that the entire process must be thrown out [as in <em>Fetta </em>] because of the hearing officer\u2019s action.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b294-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>The trial court wrote that it could not determine what the hearing officer or the ABC Board would have found had the videotape not been admitted into evidence and that only a remand would answer this question. In fashioning its remand instructions, the trial court wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-4\">Accordingly, the final decisions and orders of the ABC Board revoking the licenses of Mr. Branch will be vacated, and the case will be remanded to the Board for such further consideration and proceedings as the Board deems appropriate. <em>The Board is specifically instructed, however, that it may not base its decisions and orders on remand on any evidence related to the subject videotape, unless the case 'is farther remanded to the hearing officer to allow Branch to present evidence in rebuttal to it.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">(Emphasis added). We hold that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in fashioning these remand instructions. As the Supreme Court stated in <em>Fetta, </em>Code \u00a7 9-6.14:19<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> explicitly grants trial courts \u201cthe discretion to specify exactly what shall be done on remand.\u201d <em>Fetta, </em>244 Va. at 280, 421 S.E.2d at 412. Here, there is no evidence that the ABC Board based any of its decision on remand on any evidence related to the videotape. It was therefore unnecessary for the ABC Board to remand the case for a <em>de novo </em>hearing before a hearing officer. On remand, the ABC Board has the authority pursuant to its regulations to reconsider its decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-7\">SUFFICIENCY OF EVIDENCE ON PEACE AND GOOD ORDER CHARGE</p>\n<p id=\"b294-8\">Third, we hold that sufficient evidence supports the finding that Ivory\u2019s was so located that violations of law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>relating to peace and good behavior resulted from the issuance of Branch\u2019s ABC licenses.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b295-4\">We are guided in this determination by familiar standards of appellate review of agency decisions.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-5\">Under Code \u00a7 9-6.14:17, the scope of review is limited to whether there was \u201csubstantial evidence in the agency record\u201d to support the decision. The phrase \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d refers to \u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d The court may reject the agency\u2019s finding of fact \u201conly if, considering the record as a whole, a reasonable mind would necessarily come to a different conclusion.\u201d This standard is designed \u201cto give great stability and finality to the fact-finding process of the administrative agency.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-6\">In addition, we review the facts in the light most favorable to sustaining the Board\u2019s action and \u201ctake due account of the presumption of official regularity, the experience and specialized competence of the agency, and the purposes of the basic law under which the agency has acted.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ACs\"><em>Atkinson v. VABC, </em>1 Va.App. 172, 176, 336 S.E.2d 527, 529-30 (1985) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b295-7\">Regarding the peace and good order charge, the ABC Board had to determine:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-8\">first, that violations of the ABC Act or other laws of the Commonwealth relating to peace and good behavior [took] place at the establishment in question; second, that there [was] some nexus between these violations and the location <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>of the establishment. The location, in and of itself, must [have been] a relevant factor in the causation of the violations in order to prove that the establishment \u201c[was] so located that violations of the ABC Act or the laws of the Commonwealth relating to peace and good order [had] resulted from issuance of the license and operation thereunder.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b296-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 177, 336 S.E.2d at 530; <em>see Muse v. VABC, </em>9 Va.App. 74, 79-80, 384 S.E.2d 110, 113 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">We conclude from a complete review of the record that \u201c[substantial evidence was presented ... which gave the ABC Board reasonable cause to believe that circumstances had developed, which, if known, would have entitled the ABC Board to refuse to grant [Branch\u2019s] license at the outset.\u201d <em>Id., </em>9 Va.App. at 80, 384 S.E.2d at 113. The record establishes that violations of the law occurred at Ivory\u2019s and that Ivory\u2019s location, in and of itself, contributed to disturbances of the peace and other violations of the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-6\">Substantial evidence from the record reveals the following facts: ABC agent G.R. Gullo testified that weapons were removed from people who were refused entry to Ivory\u2019s because they were intoxicated; and a man pulled a gun on a woman who sat in Ivory\u2019s outside \u201cglass booth.\u201d Sergeant Tim Morley of the Richmond Police Department testified as to multiple violent incidents related directly to Ivory\u2019s location, including (1) the beating of a nineteen year old after an argument inside Ivory\u2019s; (2) the shooting of five persons \u201cstemming from a crowd situation outside the club\u201d; (3) the shooting of a person \u201cin the head approximately 75 feet from the front door of the club after leaving\u201d; (4) the striking of a police officer in the chest as he tried to maintain order while Ivory\u2019s was closing for the night; (5) the arrest of a person outside Ivory\u2019s for a fight that originated inside the club; (6) a woman \u201cstruck by a bottle and fists by 12 unknown suspects after refusing to dance with one of them\u201d; and (7) a man \u201cstruck in the head with a bottle inside the club.\u201d Sergeant Morley also testified that Ivory\u2019s spawned the most violent problems the police encountered in the adjacent neighborhood. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>Lieutenant David Welch of the Virginia Commonwealth Police Department testified that there were problems with crowd control at Ivory\u2019s; that there were multiple instances of fighting at Ivory\u2019s; and that gunshots were fired at Ivory\u2019s. Finally, Randall Plummer, formerly in charge of Ivory\u2019s security, testified he was assaulted at least three times and was shot at while working at the club.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-4\">Based on these facts and circumstances, we hold that the evidence supported the trial court\u2019s finding that a causal relationship, or nexus, existed between Ivory\u2019s location and the enumerated violations of the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-6\">ATTORNEY\u2019S FEES AND COSTS</p>\n<p id=\"b297-7\">Finally, based on our review of the proceedings in this case, we hold that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in finding that Branch could not recover from ABC reasonable attorney\u2019s fees and costs. <em>See Ingram v. Ingram, </em>217 Va. 27, 29, 225 S.E.2d 362, 364 (1976)(\u201cAn award of attorney\u2019s fees is a matter submitted to the trial court\u2019s sound discretion and is reviewable on appeal only for an abuse of discretion.\u201d). Code \u00a7 9-6.14:21(A) of the Virginia Administrative Process Act (VAPA) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-8\">In any civil case brought under Article 4 ... of this chapter and \u00a7 9-6.14:4.1, in which any person contests any agency action, as defined in \u00a7 9-6.14:4, such person shall be entitled to recover from that agency ... reasonable costs and attorney fees <em>if such person substantially prevails on the merits of the case and the agency is found to have acted unreasonably, </em>unless special circumstances would make an award unjust.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b297-9\">(Emphasis added). <em>See Commonwealth v. Lotz Realty Co., Inc., </em>237 Va. 1, 11, 376 S.E.2d 54, 59 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b297-10\">On Branch\u2019s first appeal, the trial court found that \u201cbecause it cannot be reasonably said that Branch has prevailed on this appeal, no attorney\u2019s fees or costs will be awarded.\u201d The trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>court\u2019s only reason for vacating the ABC Board\u2019s revocation order and remanding the case was that the hearing officer inappropriately admitted the videotape into evidence. The trial court\u2019s order specifically stated that \u201c[tjhere is nothing about that tape, or the hearing officer\u2019s or Board\u2019s consideration of it, which is <em>per se </em>so crucial or central to the Board\u2019s final decision that the entire process must be thrown out because of the hearing officers\u2019 action.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b298-4\">Assuming without deciding that Code \u00a7 9-6.14:21(A) supplements the ABC attorney\u2019s fees provisions,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> we hold that the trial court was not clearly wrong in deciding that Branch did not \u201csubstantially prevail on the merits of the case,\u201d <em>see Commonwealth v. May Bros. Inc., </em>11 Va.App. 115, 120, 396 S.E.2d 695, 698 (1990)(holding that party \u201csubstantially prevailed\u201d on the merits where all disputed issues were decided in its favor), <em>and </em>that the agency did not act \u201cunreasonably\u201d at any point in these proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">Accordingly, we affirm the trial court\u2019s order upholding the ABC Board\u2019s revocations.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b289-8\">.
