McPherson, Jr., and Juanita D. Reberio (defendants) were indicted for \u201cwillfully or negligently causing] or permit[ting]\u201d minors in their \u201ccare ... to be placed in a situation that their life, health, or morals may be endangered,\u201d in violation of Code \u00a7 40.1-103. Arguing that the statutory language is unconstitutionally vague, defendants moved to dismiss the indictments, and the trial court sustained the motions. The Commonwealth appeals, contending that the statute is constitutionally sound. We disagree and affirm the decision of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-10\">In the absence of trial, the three records before the Court reflect only brief procedural histories and few facts. Although the indictments alleged no specific offending conduct, the record otherwise indicates that defendants Carter and Reberio had been charged with driving an automobile while under the influence of alcohol (DUI), and defendant McPherson with \u201cpublic intoxication.\u201d These offenses were allegedly committed by defendants while a minor was in their care and custody, prompting the indictments for conduct which may have endangered the \u201clife, health or morals\u201d of such child.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-11\">Code \u00a7 40.1-103 is found in Chapter 5, designated \u201cChild Labor,\u201d of Title 40.1, \u201cLabor and Employment,\u201d and provides that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-12\">[i]t shall be unlawful for any person employing or having custody of any child willfully or negligently to cause or permit the life of such child to be endangered or the health <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>of such child to be injured, <em>or willfully or negligently to cause or permit such child to be placed in a situation that its life, health or morals may be endangered, </em>or to cause or permit such child to be overworked, tortured, tormented, mutilated, beaten or cruelly treated. Any person violating this section shall be guilty of a Class 6 felony.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b197-5\">(Emphasis added). Defendants\u2019 constitutional challenge is limited to the italicized language of the statute, which was substantially repeated in the indictments.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">\u201cIn assessing the constitutionality of a statute, we must presume that the legislative action is valid.\u201d <em>Perkins v. Commonwealth, </em>12 Va.App. 7, 14, 402 S.E.2d 229, <em>233 </em>(1991). \u201cGenerally, the words and phrases used in a statute should be given their ordinary and usually accepted ' meaning.... \u201d <em>Woolfolk v. Commonwealth, </em>18 Va.App. 840, 847, 447 S.E.2d 530, 534 (1994). \u201c \u2018If a statute can be made constitutionally definite by a reasonable construction, the court is under a duty to give it that construction.\u2019 \u201d <em>Perkins, </em>12 Va.App. at 14, 402 S.E.2d at 233 (quoting <em>Pedersen v. City of Richmond, </em>219 Va. 1061, 1065, 254 S.E.2d 95, 98 (1979)). When, as here, a statutory challenge does not implicate a constitutionally protected right, the \u201cnarrow question is whether [the legislation] is vague as applied to the defendants\u2019] conduct----\u201d <em>Woodfin v. Commonwealth, </em>236 Va. 89, 92, 372 S.E.2d 377, 379 (1988), <em>cert. denied, </em>490 U.S. 1009, 109 S.Ct. 1649, 104 L.Ed.2d 163 (1989). \u201cThe burden is on the challenger to prove the alleged constitutional defect.\u201d <em>Perkins, </em>12 Va.App. at 14, 402 S.E.2d at 233.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-9\">In undertaking a void-for-vagueness analysis, we are guided by a well established two-prong test. First, a penal statute, \u201cwhen measured by common understanding and practices,\u201d must define the proscribed conduct with sufficient particularity to \u201cwarn a person as to what behavior is prohibited\u201d <em>Stein v. Commonwealth, </em>12 Va.App. 65, 69, 402 S.E.2d 238, 241 (1991). Secondly, the statutory language must not encourage arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement. <em>Kolender v. Lawson, </em>461 U.S. 352, 357, 103 S.Ct. 1855, 1858, 75 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>L.Ed.2d 903 (1983); <em>Smith v. Goguen, </em>415 U.S. 566, 572-73, 94 S.Ct. 1242, 1246-47, 39 L.Ed.2d 605 (1974). This second prong recognizes \u201c \u2018the requirement that a legislature establish minimal guidelines to govern law enforcement\u2019 \u201d and has been described as \u201cthe more important aspect of [the] vagueness doctrine.\u201d <em>Kolender, </em>461 U.S. at 358, 103 S.Ct. at 1858-59 (citation omitted). It forbids the impermissible delegation of \u201c \u2018basic policy matters to policemen, judges, and juries for resolution on an <em>ad hoc </em>and subjective basis, with the attendant dangers of arbitrary and discriminatory applications.\u2019\u201d <em>Stein, </em>12 Va.App. at 69, 402 S.E.2d at 240-41 (quoting <em>Grayned v. City of Rockford, </em>408 U.S. 104, 108-09, 92 S.Ct. 2294, 2298-99, 33 L.Ed.2d 222 (1972)).</p>\n<p id=\"b198-4\">Here, defendants were charged with a violation of Code \u00a7 40.1-103 arising from conduct related to alleged intoxication while children were in their care and custody. Manifestly, potential endangerment of a child or children is the gravamen of the offense, and the instant charges arose from a perception by law enforcement officials that the conduct of each defendant <em>may </em>have threatened the \u201clife, health or morals\u201d of such children. However, neither intoxication nor other specific behavior, criminal or otherwise, is a necessary element of the felonious endangerment contemplated by the statutory language in issue. By using the term \u201cmay,\u201d the legislature criminalizes <em>any </em>act which presents a \u201cpossibility\u201d of physical or moral harm to the child. <em>See Webster\u2019s Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary </em>734 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">Thus, guided by subjectivity and personal predilection, police and prosecutors in this instance concluded that the factually diverse conduct of each defendant possibly endangered the life, health, or morals of minors then in their custody. This determination may have resulted from individual moral imperatives, unique perspectives on the specific conduct, or defendants\u2019 mere status.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Whatever the motivation and how<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>ever well-intentioned, the vague and inclusive statutoiy language clearly failed to adequately inform law enforcement of the precise conduct prohibited by Code \u00a7 40.1-103, thereby accommodating arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement. <em>See Coleman v. City of Richmond, </em>5 Va. App. 459, 466, 364 S.E.2d 239, 243-44, <em>reh\u2019g denied, </em>6 Va.App. 296, 368 S.E.2d 298 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">We do not suggest that DUI or other alcohol-related misconduct may not sufficiently endanger children to warrant criminal sanction. Code \u00a7 18.2-270 presently imposes an enhanced punishment for persons convicted of DUI \u201cwhile transporting a person seventeen years of age or younger,\u201d and Code \u00a7 18.2-371.1 punishes the \u201creckless disregard\u201d of the life of a child by \u201cany parent, guardian, or other person responsible for the care\u201d of such child. However, the constitutionally infirm language of Code \u00a7 40.1-103 in issue here is not a proper vehicle to prosecute such behavior.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-6\">Accordingly, we find the provision of Code \u00a7 40.1-103, which declares it a Class 6 felony \u201cfor any person ... having custody of any child ... to ... willfully or negligently ... cause or permit such child to be placed in a situation that its life, health or morals may be endangered,\u201d unconstitutionally vague. However, \u201c \u2018an act may be valid in one part and invalid in another, and ... that invalid part may be ignored, if after such elimination the remaining portions are sufficient to accomplish their purpose in accordance with the legislative intent....\u2019 \u201d <em>Willis v. Commonwealth, </em>10 Va.App. 430, 442, 393 S.E.2d 405, 411 (1990) (quoting <em>Strawberry Hill Land Corp. v. Starbuck, </em>124 Va. 71, 77, 97 S.E. 362, 364 (1918)). Because we find that the offending language of Code \u00a7 40.1-103 is severable, the remainder of the statute is undisturbed by this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b198-6\">. In construing Code \u00a7 46.2-357(B), we held that DUI, <em>per se, </em>\"was not ... conduct dangerous to life, limb, or property of another\u201d within the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>intendment of that statute. <em>Bishop v. Virginia, </em>20 Va.App. 206, 211, 455 S.E.2d 765, 766 (1995).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
