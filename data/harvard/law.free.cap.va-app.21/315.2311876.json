On appeal, defendant challenges the sufficiency of the evidence to support the conviction. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-10\">Under familiar principles of appellate review, we examine the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, granting to it all reasonable inferences fairly deducible therefrom. <em>Martin v. Commonwealth, 4 </em>Va.App. 438, 443, 358 S.E.2d 415, 418 (1987). The judgment of a trial court, sitting without a jury, is entitled to the same weight as a jury verdict and will be disturbed only if plainly wrong or without evidence to support it. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b361-11\">The pertinent facts are not in dispute. Defendant, then an inmate at the Southampton Work Release Center (Southampton),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> was approved for a thirty day \u201cfurlough\u201d pursuant to Code \u00a7 53.1-37(C), which authorizes the Director of the Department of Corrections (Director) to \u201cpermit a prisoner a furlough when the prisoner has been approved for release on parole by the Parole Board and thirty days or less remain to be served by the prisoner prior to his date of release on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>parole.\u201d Such furloughs \u201cextend the limits of confinement of any prisoner ... to permit ... visiting ... home or family,\u201d subject to \u201crules and regulations\u201d prescribed by the State Board of Corrections. Code \u00a7 53.1-37(A). A willful failure by a \u201cprisoner ... to remain within the limits of confinement set by the Director\u201d shall constitute an \u201cescape ... as though he left the state correctional facility itself.\u201d Code \u00a7 53.1-37(D).</p>\n<p id=\"b362-5\">As a condition to his furlough, defendant executed an \u201cExtended Furlough Agreement,\u201d which required, <em>inter alia, </em>that he report to the \u201cChief Probation and Parole Officer, Probation and Parole District # 3[,] ... Portsmouth, Va.\u201d within \u201cone working day\u201d after his release. The agreement further directed that defendant thereafter \u201creport to the supervising Probation and Parole Officer as he/she may require ... [,] follow any other instructions the officer may give,\u201d \u201cobey all ... laws and ordinances,\u201d and \u201cnot use, possess or distribute illegal drugs.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Supervision of defendant\u2019s furlough and enforcement of all related conditions were assigned to Portsmouth parole officer Albert McCloskey, with the understanding that violations would be reported to officials at Southampton for appropriate action.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-6\">Shortly after defendant\u2019s furlough commenced, he submitted a required urine specimen to McCloskey which tested \u201cpositive for marijuana use.\u201d McCloskey immediately requested instructions from Southampton and ordered defendant to report to the Portsmouth parole office the following morning. Defendant appeared as instructed, acknowledged using the drug while on furlough, and McCloskey directed that he \u201csit in the lobby, ... remain in the lobby until further notice,\u201d warning that \u201cif he left the building ... he could be charged with escape.\u201d McCloskey allowed defendant to \u201csmoke a cigarette\u201d \u201con the steps in front of the building,\u201d provided \u201che let the receptionist know before he did that,\u201d but denied his request to \u201cget something to eat.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b363-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>At approximately 1:05 p.m., MeCloskey learned that defendant \u201cwas no longer in sight\u201d of the parole office. MeCloskey searched for defendant both inside and outside the office without success, and defendant \u201cnever came back\u201d or made further contact with the parole office. He was arrested four days later in the City of Portsmouth on a warrant charging the subject offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">Because the Commonwealth did not establish that defendant \u201cleft the City of Portsmouth while on furlough,\u201d defendant contends that the evidence was insufficient to prove that he willfully exceeded the prescribed \u201climits of confinement\u201d in violation of Code \u00a7 53.1-37(D).</p>\n<p id=\"b363-6\">\u201cWhen statutory construction is required, we construe a statute to promote the end for which it was enacted, if such an interpretation can reasonably be made from the language used.\u201d <em>Woolfolk v. Commonwealth, </em>18 Va.App. 840, 847, 447 S.E.2d 530, 533 (1994). \u201cThe plain, obvious, and rational meaning of a statute is always preferred to any curious, narrow or strained construction.\u201d <em>Branch v. Commonwealth, </em>14 Va.App. 836, 839, 419 S.E.2d 422, 424 (1992). \u201cAlthough penal laws are to be construed strictly [against the Commonwealth], they \u2018ought not to be construed so strictly as to defeat the obvious intent of the legislature.\u2019\u201d <em>Willis v. Commonwealth, </em>10 Va.App. 430, 441, 393 S.E.2d 405, 411 (1990) (citation omitted). Moreover, \u201ca statute should never be construed so that it leads to absurd results.\u201d <em>Branch, </em>14 Va.App. at 839, 419 S.E.2d at 424.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-7\">Assuming, without deciding, that the statutory language \u201climits of confinement\u201d contemplates only geographical or territorial considerations, the \u201cExtended Furlough Agreement\u201d required that defendant \u201creport to the supervising ... Parole Officer as he/she ... may require and <em>follow any other instructions </em>the officer may give.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Thus, the Director clearly authorized the supervising parole officer, MeCloskey in this instance, to assume institutional control of defendant. When MeCloskey thereafter ordered defendant to remain in the lobby of the parole office, warning that noncom<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>pliance could result in a charge of \u201cescape,\u201d he specifically established new and more restrictive \u201climits of confinement\u201d governing defendant\u2019s furlough. Defendant\u2019s subsequent departure from the premises therefore constituted an escape in violation of Code \u00a7 53.1-37(D).</p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">Accordingly, we affirm the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b361-12\">.
