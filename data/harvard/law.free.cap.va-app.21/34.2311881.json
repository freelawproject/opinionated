In his initial appeal to this Court, husband contended that the trial court erred when it (1) granted wife a divorce on the ground of his adultery, (2) failed to award joint custody of the child and limited his visitation rights, (3) inequitably divided visitation on holidays, (4) failed to apply the \u201cshared\u201d custody provisions of Code \u00a7 20-108.2, and (5) failed to consider his child care expenses, travel expenses, and tax consequences to the parties as required by Code \u00a7 20-108.1. In a February 28, 1995 unpublished opinion, all of those issues were decided adversely to husband by a three-judge panel of this Court, one judge dissenting. From that opinion, husband petitioned for a rehearing <em>en banc </em>requesting only that we define \u201ca day for the purposes of the interpretation of Virginia Code Ann. Section 20-108.2(G)(3)(c).\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We agreed to hear that issue <em>en banc.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b79-7\">In husband\u2019s brief, filed after his request was granted, he restated the issue as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b79-8\">Did the trial court error [sic] in its award of child support by failing to apply the shared custody child support guidelines pursuant to Virginia Code Ann. Section 20-108.2(G)(3)(c) and in its interpretation of the term \u201cday\u201d as requiring a full 24 hour period for purposes of said statute?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b80-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>Code \u00a7 20-108.2, which contains the guidelines for the determination of child support, reads in pertinent part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-5\">(G)(3) In cases involving shared custody, the amount of child support to be paid is the difference between the amounts owed by each parent to the other parent, with the parent owing the larger amount paying the difference to the other parent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-6\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-7\">(c) ... The shared custody rules set forth herein apply when each parent has physical custody of a child or children born of the parties, ... for more than 110 <em>days </em>of the year.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A1k\">(Emphasis added). The trial court\u2019s decree awarded \u201clegal custody\u201d to wife and granted the following visitation rights with child to husband:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-8\">[Husband is reserved visitation rights] every other weekend from Friday evening at 6:00 o\u2019clock p.m. until Sunday evening at 6:00 o\u2019clock p.m. and Tuesday night each week including overnight if arrangements by [husband] can be made to deliver the child to her school the following morning; four weeks during the summer recess, two of which to be consecutive to be the last week in June and first week in July; the week before Labor Day, but not Labor Day weekend unless it is [husband\u2019s] weekend for visitation and the 3rd week in July; that [wife] shall have two consecutive weeks with the child in the summer when there will be no visitation by [husband] and that while two of the four weeks when the child is with [wife] in the summer will be consecutive, the entire four weeks will not be consecutive unless agreed by the parties; and an equal division of the major holidays alternating said holidays on an annual basis; the Christmas schedule is to be from the school recess until December 24th at 12:00 noon with [wife]; 12:00 noon until 2:00 p.m. December 25th with [husband]; 2:00 p.m. December 25th until 6:00 p.m. December 27th with [wife], and the remainder of the Christmas recess to be with [husband]. Unless the parents can mutually agree on another schedule, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>then the time shall alternate during Christmas 1993 and continue on an alternating basis hereafter.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b81-5\">Husband concedes that if the <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>definition of a day, \u201ca period of time consisting of twenty-four hours and including the solar day and the night,\u201d is the definition of \u201cday\u201d the General Assembly intended when Code \u00a7 20-108.2(G)(3)(c) was enacted, then he would not be entitled to the benefits of the shared custody rule. However, he argues that he is entitled to credit as a \u201cday\u201d for periods during which he has visitation rights that are for less than twenty-four hours. The trial court held that \u201cwhile Code Section 20-108.2.G.3(c) sets a threshold figure of 110 days to trigger the \u2018shared custody rules,\u2019 it is the opinion of the Court that it was the intent of the General Assembly that these be full twenty-four hour (24) hour [sic] days.\u201d In his brief and during his <em>en banc </em>oral argument husband argued that a \u201cstrict interpretation of \u2018day\u2019 (as contained in Code \u00a7 20-108.2) requiring a full 24 hour period of time would be unduly restrictive\u201d and suggested that we should declare that when enacting that Code section, the General Assembly intended a day to be defined as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-6\">The majority of the time as between each parent during any 24 hour period which period shall include an overnight, the said 24 hour period commencing at the time of the physical transfer of said child to the parent exercising said visitation, but excluding from said computation or times to either parent any time the child is attending school, is placed in non-parent day care, or placed with a third party.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b81-7\">We reject that contention. We believe that the General Assembly intended that for the purposes of applying the provisions of Code \u00a7 20-108.2(G)(3)(e), a day should be defined as any continuous twenty-four hour period. We hold that husband has not shown by this record that the decree awarded him'visitation rights for \u201cmore than 110 days of the year,\u201d and, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>therefore, the trial court was not required to apply the \u201cshared custody\u201d provisions of that Code section.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-5\">For the reasons stated, the judgment of the trial court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b79-10\">. Husband did not request a rehearing on the adultery or other issues decided by the panel. Accordingly, the panel\u2019s decision on those issues is unaffected by this decision.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b81-8\">. <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>357 (5th ed. 1979).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b82-7\">ELDER, J., with whom BENTON and KOONTZ, JJ.,</author>\n<p id=\"Aoe\">join, dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-8\">I respectfully dissent from the majority opinion, which defines a \u201cday\u201d as a continuous twenty-four hour period. Instead, as I stated in my separate opinion accompanying the panel\u2019s decision, I would define a day for purposes of the application of Code \u00a7 20\u2014108.2(G)(3)(c) as \u201cthe majority of a twenty-four hour period, including an overnight.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b82-9\">While I disagree with the majority\u2019s definition of a \u201cday,\u201d I applaud its decision to adopt a definition that courts may uniformly apply, something the panel majority declined to do. Unfortunately, the majority\u2019s definition is too strict. In my view, a \u201cday\u201d should be defined in a fashion that equitably accounts for the actual time each parent spends with his or her child. The majority states that the <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>definition of a \u201cday\u201d reveals the General Assembly\u2019s intended definition. However, <em>Black\u2019s </em>lists multiple definitions of a \u201cday.\u201d For example, \u201cday\u201d is also defined as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-10\">The whole or any part of period of 24 hours from midnight to midnight____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-11\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-12\">An artificial period of time, computed from one fixed point to another twenty-four hours later, without any reference to the prevalence of light or darkness____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-13\">The period of time, within the limits of a natural day, set apart either by law or by common usage for the transaction of particular business or the performance of labor; as in banking, in laws regulating the hours of labor, in contracts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>for so many \u201cdays work,\u201d and the like, the word \u201cday\u201d may signify six, eight, ten, or any number of hours.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b83-6\"><em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary, </em>396 (6th ed. 1990). It is unclear to me how the majority arrived at its determination that one of several of the <em>Black\u2019s </em>definitions supplies the General Assembly\u2019s intent, and, as I stated earlier, the majority announces a standard that is too strict.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-7\">The facts of this case reveal that for mid-week visitations, daughter was picked up by husband from school, slept overnight at husband\u2019s residence, ate breakfast with husband, and was returned to school by husband. After school, daughter went to day care, where wife later picked her up. I believe it is unfair to hold that husband should not have been credited with a \u201cday\u2019s\u201d visitation in such instances, simply because daughter attended school during a portion of the twenty-four hour period following the time he gained physical custody of the daughter. I do not believe that the General Assembly meant for courts to apply the definition of a \u201cday\u201d so rigidly.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-8\">My definition of a \u201cday\u201d comports with the majority of states that have addressed the shared custody issue. These states have used \u201covernight\u201d as the standard with which to determine whether parents have shared custody of a child. <em>See, e.g., </em>Colo.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 14-10-115(8) (1994) (stating \u201cshared physical custody\u201d means that each parent keeps the child overnight for more than ninety-two nights of the year); Idaho Code Rules Civ.Proc., Rule 6(c)(6) (1993) (stating a determination of \u201cshared physical custody\u201d involves whether a child spends more than 35% of overnights with a parent in a year); Md.Code Ann., Fam.Law \u00a7 12-201 (1994) (stating \u201cshared physical custody\u201d means that each parent keeps the child overnight for more than 35% of the year).</p>\n<p id=\"b83-9\">The parties agreed at trial that if the court were to count daughter\u2019s midweek visitations with husband as \u201cdays,\u201d husband would have exceeded the 110 day threshold. Therefore, I would reverse the trial court\u2019s child support order and remand the order for a reconsideration based on Code \u00a7 20-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>108.2\u2019s shared custody guidelines and the definition of a \u201cday\u201d found herein.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
