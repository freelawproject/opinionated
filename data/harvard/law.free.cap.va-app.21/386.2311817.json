The sole issue presented is whether the trial court erred in refusing to strike juror Glenn Brown (Brown) for cause. As the facts relating to appellant\u2019s guilt are not at issue, we recite only those relevant to the juror\u2019s qualifications.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-11\">During <em>voir dire </em>of the veniremen, Brown indicated that he might know or have heard something about the case. The following colloquy took place on individual <em>voir dire:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b432-12\">THE COURT: All right, Mr. Brown, you have indicated that you may know or have heard something about this case---- What have you heard or what do you know about this, what information have you received about this case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A94\">JUROR BROWN: Well, I work in a barber shop and I heard rumors about this, I think about a job or something that he was supposed to have working for this fellow here.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A5N\">THE COURT: When you say you have heard rumors, have you heard talk in the barber shop about this case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aur\">JUROR BROWN: I have.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AlD\">THE COURT: Is it just gossip type talk?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>JUROR BROWN: Gossip type.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-5\">THE COURT: Have you read about it in the newspaper or anything like that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-6\">JUROR BROWN: No, I haven\u2019t.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-7\">THE COURT: All right, do you want to inquire further about the kind of information?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-8\">MR. PHILLIPS<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-9\">THE COURT: What kind of information have you heard about this case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-10\">JUROR BROWN: It was something about, I believe like he had a job there, like he was supposed to have had some clothes or something he was supposed to be modeling or something.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-11\">THE COURT: What else have you heard?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-12\">JUROR BROWN: Let me see. Mostly just gossip.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-13\">THE COURT: About the fact that [the appellant] may have committed a criminal offense?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-14\">JUROR BROWN: Right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-15\">THE COURT: Do you want to go further?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-16\">MR. EASON<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>: I would, Your Honor, please. May I do it? THE COURT: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-17\">MR. EASON: Thank you, Your Honor. These were discussions between you and customers of yours in the barber shop?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-18\">JUROR BROWN: No, just overhearing talk.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-19\">MR. EASON: Did you join in those conversations? JUROR BROWN: No, I didn\u2019t.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-20\">MR. EASON: And the overhearing of those talks, did anyone express an opinion as to whether or not [the appellant] was guilty of what you were hearing?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-21\">JUROR BROWN: Not really.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b434-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>MR. EASON: Do you think that in hearing these discussions, overhearing these discussions and talks that it would put you in a position where you could not listen to all the evidence and after it comes in to render a fair and impartial decision?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b434-5\">JUROR BROWN: I would try to be fair with it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b434-6\">MR. EASON: You would try to be but do you think you could be?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b434-7\">JUROR BROWN: I will be fair, I will be fair.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b434-8\">MR. EASON: Would the evidence that\u2014excuse me, would the talk and gossip, as you so characterize them, that you heard, would that also be considered by you in making your decision today as a juror?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b434-9\">JUROR BROWN: Going by what you said at first, it\u2019s a possibility it would. I have to be honest with you on that, that\u2019s why I told you I have heard rumors about it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b434-10\">MR. EASON: I certainly appreciate your honesty.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b434-11\">THE COURT: Do you think when you heard this talk in the barber\u2014I guess it\u2019s talk in the barber shop, when you heard that and you indicate you didn\u2019t really participate in any of it but you heard people talking about it, do you recall that you might have formed or expressed any opinion or conclusion as to whether or not the charge or the matters that [the appellant] may have been accused of were true or not?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b434-12\">JUROR BROWN: Well, to be honest with you, I sort of like got an opinion about it because it was an older person that was dealing with a youth.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b434-13\">THE COURT: So you may have already formed in your mind some sort of an opinion about the case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b434-14\">JUROR BROWN: Right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b434-15\">THE COURT: And you feel that\u2014well, let me ask you this: the opinion that you may have formed in your mind, does that put you in a position of requiring the [appellant] to have to prove his innocence?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>JUROR BROWN: Well, you asked the question at first and I didn\u2019t answer that, but can I go back to that now? I had a close relative last year that had the same thing happen to her.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-5\">THE COURT: Anything else, Mr. Phillips?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-6\">MR. PHILLIPS: Do you feel you have formed an opinion, sir?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-7\">JUROR BROWN: I don\u2019t think I have formed an opinion, but I just want to be honest with it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-8\">MR. PHILLIPS: You feel the effect of what happened to your relative would have an effect on your ability to hear this case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-9\">JUROR BROWN: I do.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-10\">MR. PHILLIPS: And I don\u2019t mean to inquire, but what was it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-11\">JUROR BROWN: It was a case last year, Queen Hall, where the fellow had kicked her door in, broke in on her, took a fuse out of her box and she was an older lady, as a matter of fact, she was about 80, and she was raped, sodomized.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-12\">MR. PHILLIPS: I have no further questions, and I do appreciate your candor, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-13\">THE COURT: Are you saying that, because of that, you\u2019d come into this with basically some sort of predisposition against people who are charged with sexual offenses?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-14\">JUROR BROWN: Slightly.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-15\">THE COURT: Okay. You say slightly, do you believe now that [the appellant], because he is charged, may be guilty of this?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-16\">JUROR BROWN: Well, he has to be proven.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-17\">THE COURT: Do you believe that you can enter the jury box and hear testimony in evidence in this case and keep an open mind during all of that and wait until the case is presented to the jury for deliberation before you form any opinions about [the appellant]?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>JUROR BROWN: I would try my best to keep an open mind.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b436-4\">Appellant moved to strike Brown for cause. The court overruled the motion, stating that Brown \u201cindicated at the conclusion of all of this that he would, he felt that he could be fair and impartial and keep an open mind, that he certainly would make every effort to do that and I am going to allow him to remain on the jury panel.... \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b436-5\">The right to be tried by an impartial jury is guaranteed under both the United States and Virginia Constitutions. <em>Swanson v. Commonwealth, </em>18 VaApp. 182, 184, 442 S.E.2d 702, 703 (1994); <em>see also </em>Code \u00a7 8.01-358. For that guarantee to be effective, persons accused of violating criminal laws must be provided with \u201can impartial jury drawn from a panel [of twenty] free from exceptions.\u201d <em>Breeden v. Commonwealth, </em>217 Va. 297, 300, 227 S.E.2d 734, 736-37 (1976). Every prospective juror must stand indifferent to the cause, \u201cand any reasonable doubt as to a juror\u2019s qualifications must be resolved in favor of the accused.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 298, 227 S.E.2d at 735.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-6\">\u201cIf there be a reasonable doubt whether the juror possesses these qualifications, that doubt is sufficient to insure his exclusion. For, as has been well said, it is not only important that justice should be impartially administered, but it also should flow through channels as free from suspicion as possible.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b436-7\"><em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Wright v. Commonwealth, </em>73 Va. (32 Gratt.) 941, 943 (1879)). These principles must be strictly applied and when a prospective juror equivocates about whether he or she has formed a fixed opinion, the prospective juror should be stricken by the trial court. <em>Id.; Dejarnette v. Commonwealth, </em>75 Va. (1 Gratt.) 867 (1881).</p>\n<p id=\"b436-8\">As in <em>Breeden </em>and the cases cited therein, the <em>voir dire </em>in this case raised reasonable doubt concerning Brown\u2019s ability to stand indifferent in the cause as required by Code \u00a7 8.01-358. In our review, we must consider the entire <em>voir dire </em>rather than its isolated parts. <em>Turner v. Commonwealth, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>234 Va. 543, 548, 364 S.E.2d 483, 486, <em>cert. denied, </em>486 U.S. 1017, 108 S.Ct. 1756, 100 L.Ed.2d 218 (1988); <em>Mull\u00eds v. Commonwealth, </em>3 Va.App. 564, 570, 351 S.E.2d 919, 923 (1987). Although efforts to qualify Brown showed he would attempt to properly perform his duties as a juror, reasonable doubt remained about his impartiality. Brown admitted he had \u201cheard something about the case\u201d that, in part, matched the evidence the selected jury heard \u201c[ajbout the fact that [appellant] may have committed a criminal offense.\u201d Brown also conceded that because of what he had heard about the case, together with the fact that a relative had been the victim of a sex crime, he would hear the evidence with some sort of slight predisposition against people who are charged with sexual offenses. The admissions created a reasonable doubt that Brown would come indifferent to the cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-5\">Finally, throughout his <em>voir dire, </em>Brown spoke honestly, showing no unwillingness to serve. However, those honest answers disclosed equivocation and revealed doubt that he would be able to render a fair verdict. Brown concluded the <em>voir dire </em>by saying only that he \u201cwould try\u201d to be fair, thereby indicating that what he had heard at the barber shop combined with what he knew had happened to a relative, might affect his decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-6\">For the reasons stated, we hold that reasonable doubt was raised. We are required to resolve any reasonable doubt about a juror\u2019s qualification in appellant\u2019s favor. We hold that the trial court erred when it seated Brown on the panel. Accordingly, the judgment of the trial court is reversed and this case remanded for such further action as the Commonwealth may be advised.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-7\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b433-22\">.
