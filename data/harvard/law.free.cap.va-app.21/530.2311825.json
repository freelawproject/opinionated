Claimant contends that the commission improperly calculated the 500-week period of compensation available to him under the Virginia Workers\u2019 Compensation Act (\u201cthe Act\u201d). The commission credited employer with the number of weeks for which claimant received temporary total disability and permanent partial disability benefits under the Longshore and Harbor Workers\u2019 Compensation Act (\u201cLHWCA\u201d) before the commission\u2019s December 16,1991 award. For the following reasons, we affirm in part and reverse in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-4\">On December 11, 1984, claimant fractured his right leg while working as a sandblaster for employer. He applied for and received 137.57 weeks of temporary total disability benefits under the LHWCA from December 12, 1984 through August 2, 1987. He also received 144 weeks of permanent partial disability benefits based upon a 50% impairment rating. Thus, he received benefits under the LHWCA for a period of 281.57 weeks.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-5\">On January 11, 1988, claimant filed a claim for benefits under the Act. On December 16,1991, the commission entered an award in claimant\u2019s favor. Under this award, claimant received temporary total disability benefits from May 7, 1990 through July 12, 1994, totalling 218.27 weeks. Claimant received the same amount of weekly benefit, <em>ie., </em>$250.97, under the LHWCA and the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-6\">On December 22, 1994, employer filed an application, alleging a change in condition and requesting that the commission terminate claimant\u2019s award on the ground that he had received the maximum amount of compensation allowed under the Act, <em>ie., </em>500 weeks.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-8\">The commission\u2019s construction of the Act is entitled to great weight on appeal. <em>City of Waynesboro v. Harter, </em>1 Va.App. 265, 269, 337 S.E.2d 901, 903 (1985). However, courts are not authorized to amend, alter or extend the Act\u2019s provisions beyond their obvious meaning. <em>Gajan v. Bradlick Co., </em>4 Va.App. 213, 217, 355 S.E.2d 899, 902 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b577-9\">Code \u00a7 65.2-500(D), which governs the payment of temporary total disability benefits, provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-10\">In no case shall the period covered by such compensation be greater than 500 weeks, nor shall the total amount of all compensation exceed the result obtained by multiplying the average weekly wage of the Commonwealth as defined herein for the applicable year by 500, except that weekly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>compensation on account of total and permanent incapacity as defined by \u00a7 65.2-503 C shall continue for the lifetime of the injured employee without limit as to total amount.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b578-4\">Code \u00a7 65.2-503(F)(l), which governs the payment of permanent total and permanent partial disability benefits for the loss of or loss of use of a member, provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b578-5\">Compensation awarded pursuant to this section shall be in addition to all other compensation and shall be payable after payments for temporary total incapacity pursuant to Code \u00a7 65.2-500.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b578-6\">In this case, the commission held that claimant had received the maximum amount of benefits allowed under the Act and terminated its award as of July 12, 1994, thereby crediting employer for 281.57 weeks during which claimant had received benefits under the LHWCA. In so ruling, the commission relied upon <em>Calbeck v. Travelers Ins. Co., </em>370 U.S. 114, 131, 82 S.Ct. 1196, 82 S.Ct. at 1205-06, 8 L.Ed.2d 368 (1962), to find that employees\u2019 awards under one compensation scheme are credited against any recovery under the second scheme. The commission refused to allow claimant a double recovery. <em>See Noblin v. Randolph Corporation, </em>180 Va. 345, 23 S.E.2d 209 (1942). The commission has held in other cases that an employer is entitled to a credit for benefits paid under the LHWCA, even if the payments were made before entry of an award under the Act. <em>See Moore v. Virginia Int\u2019l Terminals, Inc., </em>VWC No. 134-44-70 (December 1, 1994); <em>McKnight v. Virginia Int\u2019l Terminals, Inc., </em>69 O.I.C. 19 (1990) (employer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>entitled to credit for identical benefits paid under the LHWCA).</p>\n<p id=\"b579-4\">The commission\u2019s ruling allowing employer a credit for the 137.57 weeks during which claimant received temporary total disability benefits under the LHWCA prior to the December 16, 1991 award is supported by <em>Calbeck </em>and the commission\u2019s prior decisions. <em>See also American Original Foods, Inc. v. Ford, </em>221 Va. 557, 561, 272 S.E.2d 187, 190 (1980). The General Assembly is presumed cognizant of the commission\u2019s construction of the Act. If such construction has long continued without change, the General Assembly is presumed to have acquiesced therein. <em>Watford v. Colonial Williamsburg Found., </em>13 Va.App. 501, 505, 413 S.E.2d 69, 71-72 (1992). Accordingly, the commission did not err in allowing employer a credit equal to 137.57 weeks against its 500-week liability under the Act for temporary total disability benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">However, the commission erred in allowing employer a 144-week credit, representing the number of weeks claimant received permanent partial disability benefits under the LHWCA, against employer\u2019s 500-week liability for temporary total disability benefits. This ruling is inconsistent with the plain language of Code \u00a7 65.2-503(F)(l) and case law interpreting that section.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-6\">Under the Act, permanent partial disability benefits awarded for the loss of use of a leg are \u201cin addition to all other compensation.\u201d Benefits awarded under Code \u00a7 65.2-503 constitute indemnity for the loss of or loss of use of a scheduled body member. Such benefits are not awarded for loss of earning capacity, as are benefits provided for under Code \u00a7 65.2-500. <em>Division of Motor Vehicles v. Williams, </em>1 Va.App. 401, 404, 339 S.E.2d 552, 554 (1986). Therefore, the commission erred in allowing employer a credit against its liability under Code \u00a7 65.2-500 equal to the 144 weeks of permanent partial disability paid to claimant under the LHWCA.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b580-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>For these reasons, we affirm in part and reverse in part and remand this ease for the commission to enter an award consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-4\">\n<em>Affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b578-7\">. Under the LHWCA, temporary total disability benefits are computed by using 66)4% of the employee\u2019s average weekly wage. 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 908(b). Permanent partial disability benefits are computed using 66)4% of the employee\u2019s average weekly wage over the scheduled number of weeks for the specific body member. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 908(c). The loss of a leg is compensated over a period of 288 weeks. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 908(c)(2). Compensation for the permanent partial loss of such body member is awarded proportionately. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 908(c)(19). Similar to the Virginia Act, the LHWCA provides that compensation for permanent partial disability \"shall be in addition to compensation for temporary total disability or temporary partial disability....\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 908(c).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b579-7\"><em>. </em>Claimant erroneously relies upon our holding in <em>Bowden v.
