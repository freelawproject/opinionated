Commonwealth, </em>19 Va.App. 30, 448 S.E.2d 331 (1994), a panel of this Court reversed and remanded for retrial Husske\u2019s convictions of forcible sodomy, rape, robbery, and breaking and entering with intent to commit rape. On the Commonwealth\u2019s motion, we stayed the mandate of that decision and granted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>rehearing <em>en banc. </em>Upon rehearing <em>en banc, </em>the judgment of the trial court is affirmed by an evenly divided court.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b136-11\">.

The appellant shall pay to the Commonwealth of Virginia thirty dollars damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-8\">It is ordered that the trial court allow counsel for the appellant a total fee of $800 for services rendered the appellant on this appeal, in addition to counsel\u2019s costs and necessary direct out-of-pocket expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-9\">The Commonwealth shall recover of the appellant the amount paid court-appointed counsel to represent him in this proceeding, counsel\u2019s costs and necessary direct out-of-pocket expenses, and the fees and costs to be assessed by the clerk of this Court and the clerk of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-10\">This order shall be published and certified to the trial court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
