He contends that the evidence was insufficient to sustain the convictions. For the reasons that follow, we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-13\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-14\">The evidence proved that after 11:45 p.m., Aretha Watkins was driving thirty-five to forty miles per hour on a two lane rural highway. The posted speed limit was fifty-five miles per hour. Watkins testified that the highway had many curves and she was not in a hurry. Paul Williams sat in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>passenger seat and conversed with Watkins. Williams\u2019 daughter was sleeping in the back seat.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">Morris was driving on the highway and began to follow Watkins. Watkins testified the automobile was close on her bumper. Williams said it was \u201ca couple of car lengths\u201d behind. The highway had solid yellow lines that prohibited passing. After following Watkins\u2019 automobile for five miles, Morris passed her.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-6\">As Morris\u2019 automobile was passing, a passenger in Morris\u2019 automobile made an offensive finger gesture. Morris\u2019 automobile continued on the highway. When Watkins traveled several miles down the road, she noticed that Morris\u2019 automobile had come almost to a stop in the road. Watkins began to slow down.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-7\">Williams observed a rifle barrel come out of the driver\u2019s side of Morris\u2019 vehicle. Williams testified that the gun was fired twice toward the woods. He observed that the gun was pointed perpendicular to Morris\u2019 automobile and not toward the automobile he occupied. After the shots, Morris\u2019 automobile sped away. Williams stated that he and Watkins were upset and Watkins felt nauseous.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-8\">Watkins heard and saw the gunfire. She also saw the gun barrel being withdrawn after the firing but did not see the barrel come out of the car initially. Watkins testified that she \u201cpanicked\u201d after the gunfire and wrote down the license number of Morris\u2019 automobile.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-9\">A witness testified that he saw Morris later that night. Morris stated in the witness\u2019 presence that \u201che was coming down Route 20 South and there was a car that was tailgating him and to stop the car from tailgating he held a rifle out the window and fired it.\u201d Morris said that after the gun was fired \u201cthe car got off his bumper.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b352-10\">At the conclusion of the evidence, the jury was instructed on the elements of the offense as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b353-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>The defendant is charged with the crime of shooting from a vehicle. The Commonwealth must prove beyond a reasonable doubt each of the following elements of that crime:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-5\">(1) That the defendant intentionally discharged a firearm while in or on a motor vehicle; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-6\">(2) That the defendant thereby created a risk of injury or death to Aretha Watkins.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b353-7\">A similar instruction was given naming Williams as an object of the offense. The jury found \u201cMorris, guilty of shooting from a vehicle and thereby creating a risk of injury or death to Aretha Watkins\u201d and Paul Williams.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-9\">Morris was indicted and tried for violation of the following statute:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-10\">Any person who, while in or on a motor vehicle, intentionally discharges a firearm so as to create the risk of injury or death to another person or thereby cause another person to have a reasonable apprehension of injury or death shall be guilty of a Class 5 felony. Nothing in this section shall apply to a law-enforcement officer in the performance of his duties.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b353-11\">Code \u00a7 18.2-286.1. However, the jury was instructed only that the elements of the offense were \u201cintentionally discharg[ing] a firearm while in ... a motor vehicle ... thereby creating] a risk of injury or death.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The instruction as drafted and given to the jury charged one of the two possible offenses specified within Code \u00a7 18.2-286.1 in the disjunctive. It became the law of the case. <em>See Spencer v. Commonwealth, </em>240 Va. 78, 89, 393 S.E.2d 609, 616, <em>cert. denied, </em>498 U.S. 908, 111 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>S.Ct. 281, 112 L.Ed.2d 235 (1990); <em>Owens-Illinois, Inc. v. Thomas Baker Real Estate Ltd., </em>237 Va. 649, 652, 379 S.E.2d 344, 346 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">The evidence proved that while Morris was in the automobile he discharged a gun in the direction of a woods. The gun was pointed out the driver\u2019s side of the automobile and was held perpendicular to the side of the automobile while it was fired into the woods adjoining the highway. The evidence further proved that Watkins and Williams were in an automobile travelling behind Morris\u2019 automobile. Williams\u2019 testimony clearly established that the gun was not aimed at or in the direction of the automobile occupied by Watkins and Williams. Although Watkins and Williams both testified that they were upset by the incident and that Watkins \u201cpanicked,\u201d this evidence tended to prove apprehension in Watkins and Williams. However, that aspect of Code \u00a7 18.2-286.1 was not charged in instructions to the jury as an element of the offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-6\">The evidence showed that Watkins\u2019 vehicle was in the same lane of travel and behind Morris\u2019 vehicle. No evidence proved the distance between the two automobiles. The evidence proved that Watkins was not attempting to pass Morris\u2019 automobile when the gun was discharged. No evidence proved that Watkins\u2019 driving was affected by the shooting. The evidence failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that a risk of injury or death to Watkins or Williams arose by virtue of the gun being discharged into the woods.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-7\">Accordingly, the convictions are reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-8\">\n<em>Reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b353-12\">. The jury was not instructed that a violation of the statute could also be found upon proof that Morris, \"while in a motor vehicle, intentionally discharge[d] a firearm so as to ... thereby cause another person to have a reasonable apprehension of injury or death.\u201d Code \u00a7 18.2-286.1. The failure to so instruct the jury may be traced, in part, to Model Jury Instructions No. 19.350, which does not contain language informing the jury that an element of the crime may also be established by proof of that conduct.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
