Nicholson, she expressly waived her entitlement to a share of her former spouse\u2019s retirement annuity under the -Foreign Service Act (Act). We find that the terms of the Nicholsons\u2019 property settlement agreement are insufficient to support the trial court\u2019s finding of an express waiver. Accordingly, we reverse the trial court\u2019s ruling. We remand the case for the trial court to enter an order holding that Maria-Teresa Nicholson did not, in the May 4, 1981, property settlement agreement, expressly waive her statutory right to a share of her former spouse\u2019s retirement annuity.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">The Nicholsons were married in 1968 and separated in 1980. Throughout the marriage, Ronald Nicholson was employed by the United States Foreign Service. Effective February 15, 1981, Congress enacted the Foreign Service Act of 1980, 22 U.S.C. \u00a7 3901 <em>et seq., </em>which conferred upon former spouses of members of the foreign service entitlement to a retirement annuity of up to fifty percent of the participant\u2019s annuity, depending upon the duration of the participant\u2019s service and marriage, \u201c[u]nless otherwise expressly provided by [a] spousal agreement or court order.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b280-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>On May 4, 1981, two and one-half months after the effective date of the Foreign Service Act of 1980, the Nicholsons executed a property settlement agreement.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The pertinent provisions of their property settlement agreement, which Ronald Nicholson contends constitute an express waiver of Mrs. Nicholson\u2019s rights under the Act, are as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">[The parties] desire to effect a full and complete settlement of their respective property rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-6\">$$$$$$</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-7\">5. It is further understood and agreed that both parties shall have the right to sell or otherwise dispose of any and all property, which he or she may now or in the future own personally (and not listed herein) without demand being made upon either of them....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-8\">6. Each of the parties does hereby relinquish and release to the other all rights and curtesy or dower that he or she may have in the property hereinafter acquired by either of them....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b280-9\">The parties were divorced in 1985, and the decree \u201caffirmed ratified and incorporated by reference\u201d the property settlement agreement. In 1994 when Ronald Nicholson retired from the foreign service, Maria-Teresa Nicholson filed a claim with the Department of State for a former spouse\u2019s annuity under 22 U.S.C. \u00a7 4054(a)(1). In response, pursuant to Code \u00a7 20-121.1, Ronald Nicholson filed a petition in the Arlington County Circuit Court to have their divorce case reinstated on the docket in order to have the court construe whether the terms of the property settlement agreement \u201cexpressly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>waived\u201d Maria-Teresa Nicholson\u2019s right to a share of his retirement annuity.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>See also </em>Code \u00a7 20-107.3(K)(4) (conferring authority and jurisdiction on a divorce court to enforce or modify a divorce decree in such a manner as to affect or divide a pension or retirement benefits pursuant to federal laws \u201cso as to effectuate the expressed intent\u201d of a prior decree). The trial court held that \u201cby the terms of said Property Agreement,\u201d Maria-Teresa Nicholson \u201chas waived any property rights\u201d or \u201cany entitlement that she may have had ... to any portion of the pension or other retirement benefits\u201d of Ronald L. Nicholson. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b281-6\">Under 22 U.S.C. \u00a7 4054(a) a former spouse, who was married to a foreign service member for a requisite number of years of creditable service, is entitled to a share of the member\u2019s retirement annuity, unless or until the former spouse of the member remarries before age 60. When Congress enacted the provisions of the Foreign Service Act that established the right of a former spouse to a share of a foreign service retiree\u2019s annuity, Congress preempted the right of states to determine the property rights of a former spouse <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>according to the state\u2019s respective family law principles.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In doing so, however, Congress limited its federal preemption by recognizing that the parties and state courts have a superior right under their domestic relations law to determine those marital or property rights when <em>\u201cexpressly provided, </em>by any spousal agreement or court order.\u201d (Emphasis added). 22 U.S.C. \u00a7 4054(a)(1). Thus, 22 U.S.C. \u00a7 4054 recognizes that divorcing parties in a spousal agreement or divorce courts in their decrees may (1) vary the amount of the retirement annuity payable to a former spouse from the amount set by statute, subject to the maximum limitation provided by the Act, or (2) may release, relinquish, or waive any or all rights a former spouse may have in a member\u2019s retirement annuity under the Act. <em>Id. </em>However, in order for a spousal agreement or court decree to affect a former spouse\u2019s statutory right to the federal pension, 22 U.S.C. \u00a7 4060(b)(1)(A) provides that the spousal agreement controls only \u201cif and to the extent expressly provided for in the terms of that spousal agreement.\u201d <em>See Wilkinson v. Wilkinson, </em>785 F.Supp. 1037 (D.D.C.1992), <em>aff'd </em>986 F.2d 546 (1993) (holding that general waiver or release of \u201call ... claims ... or demands\u201d was not sufficient to satisfy the \u201cexpress waiver\u201d provision).</p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">Therefore, we look to the Nicholsons\u2019 1981 property settlement agreement to determine if and to what extent the agreement \u201cexpressly provides\u201d for a waiver or relinquishment of Maria-Teresa Nicholson\u2019s rights to her share of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>Ronald Nicholson\u2019s foreign service retirement annuity. If the provisions of the Nicholsons\u2019 spousal agreement can be reasonably construed to \u201cexpressly\u201d waive Maria-Teresa Nicholson\u2019s entitlement to a share of her former spouse\u2019s retirement annuity, the trial court\u2019s judgment must be affirmed. Code \u00a7 8.01-680; <em>see Galloway Corp. v. Wise, </em>244 Va. 344, 346, 421 S.E.2d 431, 433 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">When a judgment is based upon the construction or interpretation of a contract, an appellate court is not bound by the trial court\u2019s construction of the contract\u2019s provisions. <em>Smith v. Smith, </em>3 Va.App. 510, 513, 351 S.E.2d 593, 595 (1986). An appellate court is equally able to construe the meaning of the provisions of an unambiguous contract. <em>Wilson v. Holyfield, </em>227 Va. 184, 188, 313 S.E.2d 396, 398 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">Ronald Nicholson contends that the holding in <em>Himes v. Himes, </em>12 Va.App. 966, 407 S.E.2d 694 (1991), controls our decision in this case. We disagree. <em>Himes </em>dealt with whether, under Virginia law, a general waiver of property rights in a property settlement became a vested right that prevented one spouse from making a claim against the other spouse\u2019s retirement benefits when the equitable distribution statute was subsequently enacted. The Nicholsons\u2019 case involves the interpretation and application of a federal statute, which has a requirement of \u201cexpress\u201d waiver by a spousal agreement or court order.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-7\">The terms of the Nicholsons\u2019 spousal agreement are not ambiguous. Interpretation of this contract does not require the admission of parol evidence in order to understand it. The sole question for our consideration is whether the terms of paragraphs 5 and 6, when considered with the general purpose of the agreement stated in the preamble, satisfy the requirements of 22 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 4054(a)(1) and 4060(b)(1)(A) that before a former spouse may be denied her federal statutory entitlement, the spousal agreement must \u201cexpressly\u201d provide for a waiver or relinquishment. Accordingly, while we construe the Nicholsons\u2019 agreement according to Virginia principles of contract construction, the statutory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>requirement that the rights of the parties \u201cshall be determined in accordance with that spousal agreement ... if and to the extent expressly provided for in the terms of that spousal agreement\u201d is a standard established by federal statute. In determining whether the spousal agreement \u201cexpressly\u201d waives a federal statutory right, the purpose of the federal statute and what is required in order to establish an express waiver are questions of federal law, and the intent of Congress in enacting the Foreign Service Act will control. <em>Wilkinson, 785 </em>F.Supp. at 1039-40.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">In the absence of federal court decisions construing this statute, we must determine what Congress intended when it provided that the spousal agreement will control the federal pension right \u201cif and to the extent <em>expressly </em>provided for in the terms of that agreement.\u201d Considering the legislative history of 22 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 4054 and 4060, <em>see </em>n. 5, <em>supra, </em>we believe that Congress clearly intended that the statutory entitlement of a former spouse under the Foreign Service Act cannot be waived or released by a general waiver or release. <em>See id. </em>at 1040.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-6\">Given the language of the federal statute, particularly when considered with its legislative history, Congress clearly intended that in order to waive, release or vary the terms of the statutory entitlement, more would be required than a general waiver of property rights. <em>Id. </em>The intent of the parties or court to waive or vary this federal statutory right must be manifest from the \u201cexpress\u201d terms of the agreement or decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-7\">We do not, by this holding, necessarily construe 22 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 4054 and 4060 to require that a spousal agreement or court decree, in order to constitute an \u201cexpress waiver,\u201d specifically mention retirement benefits or an annuity under the Foreign Service Act. <em>See generally Bragan v. Bragan, </em>4 Va.App. 516, 358 S.E.2d 757 (1987). A general waiver or release may be sufficient if, from the terms of the agreement, the parties\u2019 intent to include pension or retirement benefits is clear and unambiguous. Although a general waiver of all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>property rights that one spouse may <em>presently </em>have in a property interest acquired by the other might satisfy the requirements of an \u201cexpress waiver,\u201d the provisions in paragraphs 5 and 6 of the Nicholsons\u2019 agreement do not in our opinion meet the federal standard of an \u201cexpress\u201d waiver of the statutory entitlement to the former spouse\u2019s annuity.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">Although the Nicholsons\u2019 expressed intention for entering the agreement was to resolve \u201call their property rights,\u201d that general statement of purpose, in the absence of provisions that expressly address their property rights, cannot be construed as an express release or waiver of property rights. The general statement of purpose does not satisfy the requirement of 22 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 4054(a)(1) and 4060 that the spousal agreement must \u201cexpressly\u201d provide for terms that vary the statutory benefits or which release or relinquish the former spouse\u2019s retirement annuity.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-6\">The provisions of the Nicholsons\u2019 spousal agreement do not mention Mr. Nicholson\u2019s entitlement under the Foreign Service Act. The parties\u2019 agreement does not even mention retirement rights or pension benefits generally. <em>See Dean v. Dean, </em>8 Va.App. 143, 379 S.E.2d 742 (1989) (holding that a broad categorical waiver of equitable distribution, spousal support and attorney\u2019s fees did not waive all of a spouse\u2019s property rights). At most, paragraphs 5 and 6 constitute general waivers of rights of inheritance or relinquishment of rights to make a claim on property acquired after the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-7\">In paragraph 5, the Nicholsons covenanted that each had the right to sell or alienate his or her property without the other making any demand upon the after-acquired property. This provision did no more than recognize the right of each party to dispose of his or her property without \u201cdemand\u201d from the other.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-8\">Paragraph 6 of the Nicholsons\u2019 agreement is even more limited in scope than is paragraph 5. When read in conjunction with paragraph 5, paragraph 6 accomplishes somewhat the same result as does paragraph 5. However, it applies only to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>\u201cproperty hereinafter acquired by either\u201d party and, thus, has no application to Maria-Teresa Nicholson\u2019s annuity under 22 U.S.C. \u00a7 4054, an inchoate entitlement Maria-Teresa Nicholson possessed at the time the agreement was executed. Thus, we hold that paragraphs 5 and 6 did not \u201cexpressly\u201d provide for a waiver, release, or relinquishment of Maria-Teresa Nicholson\u2019s benefits under the Foreign Services Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-5\">We hold, therefore, that the terms of the Nicholsons\u2019 property settlement agreement are insufficient to support the trial court\u2019s finding that Maria-Teresa Nicholson \u201cexpressly\u201d waived her right to her former spouse\u2019s annuity under the Foreign Service Act. Accordingly, we remand the case for the trial court to enter a final order in the case in accordance with the holding herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-6\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b278-14\">. Although the ultimate issue in this case involves the rights of parties under a federal statute to retirement benefits of a foreign service employee, the Court of Appeals has jurisdiction of this appeal pursuant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>to Code \u00a7 17\u2014116.05(3)(b) and (f) because the proceeding involves the construction of a property settlement agreement incorporated into a divorce decree.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b279-7\">. 22 U.S.C. \u00a7 4054(a)(1) states in part: \u201cUnless otherwise <em>expressly provided by any spousal agreement </em>or court order under Section 4060(b)(1) of this title, a former spouse of a participant or former participant is entitled to an annuity.\u201d (Emphasis added).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-8\">22 U.S.C. \u00a7 4060(b)(1)(A) further provides:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-9\">In the case of any participant or annuitant who has a former spouse who is covered by a court order or who is a party to a spousal agreement ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-10\">(i) any right of the former spouse to any annuity under Section 4054(a) of this title ... shall be determined in accordance with that spousal agreement or court order, if and to the extent expressly provided for in the terms of that spousal agreement or court order.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b280-10\">. At the time the Nicholsons entered into their property settlement agreement, the Virginia General Assembly had not enacted the equitable distribution statute, Code \u00a7 20-107.3. The statute did not become effective until July 1, 1982. Therefore, when the Nicholsons contemplated the terms of their property settlement agreement neither spouse had a basis under Virginia law to claim or expect a share in the other\u2019s retirement benefits. Thus, although Maria-Teresa Nicholson\u2019s claim is one of statutory entitlement under the federal Foreign Service Act, rather than a claim for equitable distribution, the state of the law in Virginia as to equitable distribution at the time of their agreement is relevant to an understanding of the terms of their agreement.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b281-7\">. At a hearing for reconsideration of the trial court\u2019s ruling, Maria-Teresa Nicholson presented a letter from the United States Department of State which stated that the Department had reviewed the Nicholsons\u2019 property settlement agreement and determined that the spousal agreement and divorce order did not expressly waive her statutory entitlement to an annuity. Although the trial judge viewed and considered the letter at the reconsideration hearing, he did not mark the letter as an exhibit and formally admit it into evidence. <em>See </em>Rules 5A:7 and 5:10. Consequently, Ronald Nicholson has requested on appeal that it be stricken from the record and not considered. However, because the trial court viewed and considered the letter, but did not receive it as an exhibit, we deny Mr. Nicholson\u2019s motion to strike the letter from the record. <em>See Mueller v. Commonwealth, </em>15 Va.App. 649, 652, 426 S.E.2d 339, 341 (1993); <em>see also Martin v. Winston, </em>181 Va. 94, 105, 23 S.E.2d 873, 877, <em>cert. denied, </em>319 U.S. 766, 63 S.Ct. 1330, 87 L.Ed. 1716 (1943). Nevertheless, the letter is irrelevant to our determination because we decide whether the spousal agreement or court order expressly waives the former spouse\u2019s statutory entitlement to a retirement annuity based upon the law and facts independent of the State Department's administrative decision.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b282-6\">. By enacting the former spouse provisions of the Foreign Service Act, Congress determined not to grant to the states the deference traditionally shown by the federal government in the area of a state\u2019s family and domestic relations law. In explaining the reasons for its action, Congress stated, \u201d[w]idely varying divorce laws from state to state would result in different awards of a Federal benefit for the same deprivations. Furthermore, there is little or no awareness among the legal community of the special problems faced by Foreign Service spouses.\u201d Congress recognized the need for a former spouse annuity due to the fact that spouses of Foreign Service members could rarely establish their own independent careers or retirement pensions due to frequent transfers to various posts.
