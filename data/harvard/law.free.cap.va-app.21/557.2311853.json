On appeal, he argues that the trial court erred in: (1) allowing an expert witness to testify about the victim\u2019s posttraumatic stress disorder and thus corroborate the victim\u2019s testimony, and (2) finding the evidence sufficient to support the convictions. For the reasons that follow, we affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-11\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b604-12\">On October 19,1993, the victim awoke at approximately 9:00 a.m. when she heard a noise at the door of her trailer. While sitting on her bed, she saw a person dressed in a camouflage outfit coming toward her. Although the intruder\u2019s face was covered, the victim believed that she recognized the intruder because of his build. She testified that she said, \u201cTommy,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>the name she called appellant, who was her neighbor and an acquaintance of her male friend.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-5\">The intruder pushed the victim prone on the bed, bound her hands behind her back, and taped her mouth. The victim struggled as the intruder fondled her breast, inserted his fingers in her vagina, attempted to insert his penis in her mouth, and attempted to have sexual intercourse with her. While struggling, the victim freed one of her hands and tore off the intruder\u2019s mask, which allowed her to see his nose and lips. She testified that this view of the intruder\u2019s nose and lips confirmed her belief that the intruder was the man she called \u201cTommy,\u201d the appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-6\">The victim identified a camouflage outfit that the police seized from appellant\u2019s apartment as the clothing worn by her attacker. She recalled that the shirt was \u201cfaded, ... had holes in it, and [had] the same design.\u201d She further testified that, during the half hour the intruder was in her trailer, she clearly saw his clothing and heard his voice when he engaged in extensive conversations with her. At trial, she identified appellant as the intruder.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-7\">Appellant testified at trial and denied involvement in this incident. He testified that he got out of bed between 9:00 a.m. and 9:30 a.m. and went to the Laurel Mills store to buy coffee. He lived directly behind the store, which was located one-quarter mile from the victim\u2019s trailer. At approximately 9:30 a.m., Harlan Coffey (Coffey) knocked on appellant\u2019s door to borrow a cooler. Appellant went with Coffey into the store\u2019s parking lot. Five people, including Coffey, verified appellant\u2019s presence at the store at 9:30 a.m.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-8\">EXPERT TESTIMONY</p>\n<p id=\"b605-9\">Appellant contends that the trial court erred in allowing Peggy Christensen (Christensen), a licensed clinical social worker, to testify that the victim suffered from posttraumatic stress disorder. Appellant\u2019s argument is that, by corroborating the victim\u2019s version of the events, Christensen\u2019s testimony was used to enhance the victim\u2019s credibility, and this use <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>invaded the jury\u2019s function of determining the credibility of witnesses. In overruling appellant\u2019s objections at trial, the trial judge stated: \u201cI will instruct the Commonwealth that [Christensen\u2019s] not to give any opinion as to the victim\u2019s truthfulness. Other than that, the Court will rule that the Commonwealth has the right to call an expert witness as to counseling.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b606-5\">At trial, Christensen testified that, three months after the reported incident, she began counseling the victim. The victim told Christensen that she had been sexually assaulted and was \u201chaving a great deal of symptoms that were making it difficult for her to feel safe and functional.\u201d Christensen described the victim\u2019s symptoms, including violent nightmares involving the intruder, sleep disturbances, recurrent flashbacks, and difficulty being around men. Christensen \u201cfound [the victim] to be suffering from posttraumatic stress disorder,\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> explained how she reached her diagnosis from the symptoms that the victim related, and testified that posttraumatic stress disorder may afflict \u201canyone who has had a traumatic event outside of normal human experience that would be markedly distressing to almost anyone.\u201d Additionally, Christensen identified and explained the four criteria necessary to diagnose posttraumatic stress disorder. Applying these criteria to the victim, Christensen expressed her professional opinion that the victim demonstrated the requisite number of criteria to support a diagnosis of posttraumatic stress disorder. Christensen did not recount any details of the rape that the victim may have told her.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-6\">Appellant asserts that Christensen commented on the credibility of the victim when she testified that she \u201chad to decide whether [she] believed [the victim] or not\u201d and acknowledged that the correctness of her diagnosis of posttraumatic stress disorder depended upon whether she believed the victim\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>history regarding her symptoms. However, these statements were in response to cross-examination by defense counsel and were not elicited by the Commonwealth. During her testimony on direct examination, Christensen never stated that she believed the victim was telling the truth or that she believed the victim had been sexually assaulted.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-5\">\u201c \u2018The admissibility of evidence is within the broad discretion of the trial court, and a ruling will not be disturbed on appeal in the absence of an abuse of discretion.\u2019 \u201d <em>Crews v. Commonwealth, </em>18 Va.App. 115, 118, 442 S.E.2d 407, 409 (1994) (quoting <em>Blain v. Commonwealth, </em>7 Va.App. 10, 16, 371 S.E.2d 838, 842 (1988)). \u201c[Ejxperts in criminal cases must testify on the basis of their own personal observations or on the basis of evidence adduced at trial.\u201d <em>Buchanan v. Commonwealth, </em>238 Va. 389, 416, 384 S.E.2d 757, 773 (1989), <em>cert. denied, </em>493 U.S. 1063, 110 S.Ct. 880, 107 L.Ed.2d 963 (1990). In this case, Christensen\u2019s diagnosis was based on her personal clinical observations of the victim during ten therapy sessions and on the victim\u2019s description of her problems and fear resulting from the incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-6\">\u201cEvidence is relevant if it has any logical tendency, however slight, to establish a fact at issue in the case.\u201d <em>Ragland v. Commonwealth, </em>16 Va.App. 913, 918, 434 S.E.2d 675, 678 (1993). \u201cOnce evidence is determined to be relevant and material, \u2018[t]he responsibility for balancing ... probative value and prejudice rests in the sound discretion of the trial court,\u2019 and its decision \u2018will not be disturbed on appeal in the absence of a clear abuse.\u2019 \u201d <em>Wilkins v. Commonwealth, </em>18 Va.App. 293, 298, 443 S.E.2d 440, 443 (1994) (en banc) (quoting <em>Ferrell v. Commonwealth, </em>11 Va.App. 380, 390, 399 S.E.2d 614, 620 (1990)). In a prosecution for rape, \u201c[t]he physical <em>and mental </em>condition, as well as <em>the conduct of the prosecutrix, </em>... is <em>always </em>admissible. The remoteness of the examination by a physician [or therapist], from the date of the crime, affects its probative force, but not necessarily its admissibility.\u201d <em>Loving v. Commonwealth, </em>165 Va. 761, 765, 182 S.E. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>224, 225 (1935) (emphasis added).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>See also Elam v. Commonwealth, </em>229 Va. 113, 115, 326 S.E.2d 685, 686-87 (1985) (holding medical and forensic evidence of physical injury to be sufficient circumstantial evidence, along with other evidence, to prove rape, despite the prosecutrix\u2019s testimony that she did not believe she had been raped); <em>Tuggle v. Commonwealth, </em>228 Va. 493, 510-11, 323 S.E.2d 539, 549-50 (1984) (holding medical evidence of physical injuries sufficient as circumstantial evidence to prove rape), <em>judgment vacated on other grounds, </em>471 U.S. 1096, 105 S.Ct. 2315, 85 L.Ed.2d 835 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b608-5\">We reject appellant\u2019s argument that Christensen\u2019s testimony constituted a comment on the victim\u2019s credibility. Christensen testified only as to the history of the victim\u2019s symptoms, her clinical observations of the victim, and her diagnosis of the victim\u2019s emotional disorder based upon those symptoms. Christensen did not testify about any details of the attack, give the victim\u2019s version of the offense, or testify that she believed the victim was telling the truth. She merely testified that, based on her observations of the victim, the victim was suffering from posttraumatic stress disorder caused by some traumatizing event. Additionally, any comment as to whether Christensen believed the victim was raised solely during the cross-examination of Christensen.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-6\"><em>Davison v. Commonwealth, </em>18 Va.App. 496, 445 S.E.2d 683 (1994), relied on by appellant, is readily distinguishable from the instant case. In <em>Davison, </em>this Court held that the trial court erred by allowing a \u201ctherapist\u201d to testify concerning the \u201cphenomenon of recanting\u201d to explain why a child would give an extrajudicial statement different from the child\u2019s testimony and initial account of a sexual assault. <em>Id. </em>at 498-99, 445 S.E.2d at 684-85. The witness in <em>Davison, </em>who had read one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>article on recantation, was permitted to testify as to whether a child\u2019s recantation should be disbelieved. <em>Id. </em>at 500-01, 445 S.E.2d at 685-86. We held that the therapist\u2019s testimony was inadmissible for a number of reasons, including that the witness was offering an opinion about why the child\u2019s testimony should be believed and why a prior inconsistent statement should be disbelieved. <em>Id. </em>at 503, 445 S.E.2d at 687. No such testimony was elicited in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-5\">We hold that evidence of an emotional or psychological injury such as posttraumatic stress disorder, like medical evidence of physical injury, is relevant as circumstantial evidence of the occurrence of a traumatizing event. In this case, Christensen\u2019s testimony corroborated the fact that the victim had suffered a traumatizing event, as evidenced by her mental condition, and constituted neither the expression of an opinion on the victim\u2019s credibility nor an opinion as to which version of events should be accepted by the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-6\">SUFFICIENCY OF THE EVIDENCE</p>\n<p id=\"b609-7\">On appeal, appellant argues that insufficient evidence supports his convictions because of inconsistencies in the victim\u2019s testimony, and that the circumstantial evidence produced at trial did not exclude every reasonable hypothesis of innocence. However, in his motion to strike made at the end of the Commonwealth\u2019s case, appellant\u2019s counsel argued only that the evidence failed to establish that the intruder was armed with a deadly weapon when breaking and entering, and that the sexual battery charge was a lesser-included offense of the attempted rape and attempted forcible sodomy charges. Appellant\u2019s counsel renewed the motion to strike at the end of appellant\u2019s case based on the \u201csame argument.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b609-8\">\u201cNo ruling of the trial court ... will be considered as a basis for reversal unless the objection was stated together with the grounds therefor at the time of the ruling----\u201d Rule 5A:18. <em>See Jacques v. Commonwealth, </em>12 Va.App. 591, 593, 405 S.E.2d 630, 631 (1991). At trial, appellant failed to raise the specific arguments he now raises on appeal. Moreover, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>the record does not reflect any reason to invoke the good cause or ends of justice exceptions to Rule 5A:18. Thus, Rule 5A.T8 bars our consideration of these arguments on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-5\">Accordingly, the judgment of the trial court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b606-7\">. Christensen testified that posttraumatic stress disorder is recognized in the profession as a mental disorder and that the criteria for diagnosis are set forth in the <em>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, </em>a recognized text in her field. See <em>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders </em>\u00a7 309.89, at 247-352 (3d ed. rev. 1987).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b608-7\">. Similarly, this Court has held that expert testimony on battered child syndrome \u201c \u2018is not an opinion regarding the culpability of any particular defendant____ [It] merely tends to show that the child was intentionally, rather than accidentally, injured.' \" <em>Price v. Commonwealth, </em>18 Va.App. 760, 765, 446 S.E.2d 642, 645 (1994) (quoting <em>Commonwealth v. Rodgers, </em>364 Pa.Super. 477, 528 A.2d 610, 614 (1987), <em>appeal denied, </em>518 Pa. 638, 639, 542 A.2d 1368 (Pa.1988)).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b610-7\">BENTON, Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AUB\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-8\">In his pretrial argument concerning the admissibility of testimony from a social worker who counseled the victim three months after the incident, the prosecutor proffered that her testimony was \u201ccorroboration\u201d of the victim\u2019s testimony. The Commonwealth asserted that the social worker would testify that \u201cnothing in [the victim\u2019s] personal history show[ed] a traumatic event that would lead to ... [the victim\u2019s post-traumatic stress] other than her reported sexual attack.\u201d No reason other than this credibility enhancement was offered. The trial judge overruled Taylor\u2019s objections that the social worker\u2019s testimony was not relevant to prove Taylor\u2019s guilt, that her testimony contained hearsay, and that her testimony improperly bolstered the testimony of the victim by invading the jury\u2019s function to determine the victim\u2019s credibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-9\">The holding in <em>Davison v. Commonwealth, </em>18 Va.App. 496, 445 S.E.2d 683 (1994), should guide this decision:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b610-10\">In proffering [the therapist] as an expert, it was the prosecutor\u2019s intent to bolster the truth of [the victim\u2019s] testimony at trial. It is well settled that an expert may not \u201cexpress an opinion as to the veracity of any witness.\u201d The prosecutor\u2019s question to [the therapist] specifically concerned the testimony of a \u201cparticular ... witness\u201d and, thus, was clearly \u201cintended to elicit an opinion\u201d of veracity. Such evidence is a comment on an ultimate fact within the province of the jury and must be excluded by the trial court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b610-11\"><em>Id. </em>at 504, 445 S.E.2d at 688 (citations omitted). <em>See also Coppola v. Commonwealth, </em>220 Va. 243, 252, 257 S.E.2d 797, 803 (1979), <em>cert. denied, </em>444 U.S. 1103, 100 S.Ct. 1069, 62 L.Ed.2d 788 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b611-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>At trial, the victim testified that Taylor was the intruder who sexually assaulted her. Taylor denied that he was the intruder. Thus, the victim\u2019s identification of Taylor as her assailant was crucial to the Commonwealth\u2019s case. Her credibility as a witness, therefore, was at issue. <em>See Taylor v. Commonwealth, </em>3 Va.App. 59, 62-63, 348 S.E.2d 36, 38 (1986). The resolution of this conflicting testimony presented an ultimate issue of fact as to the identity of the intruder. <em>See Evans-Smith v. Commonwealth, </em>5 Va.App. 188, 209-10, 361 S.E.2d 436, 448 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b611-5\">Over Taylor\u2019s renewed objection, the social worker testified as an expert witness for the Commonwealth. She testified that three months after the reported incident she began the first of ten counseling sessions with the victim. The social worker related statements of the victim, including the victim\u2019s complaints of violent nightmares, sleep disturbances, recurrent flashbacks, difficulty being around men, and \u201chaving a great deal of symptoms that were making it difficult for her to feel safe and functional.\u201d In addition, however, the social worker testified that the victim told her that she had \u201cbeen the victim of a sexual assault.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b611-6\">In his questioning of the social worker, the prosecutor asked for a diagnosis \u201cbased on this information you received from [the victim].\u201d The social worker testified that she made an \u201cassessment\u201d of the victim based upon the victim\u2019s own statements to her more than three months after reporting the event. From the information contained in these statements, the social worker opined that the victim suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder. She explained that the disorder is caused by \u201ca traumatic event outside of normal human experience that would be markedly distressing to almost anyone.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b611-7\">Assuming as true that the victim suffered from posttraumatic stress disorder and assuming the social worker was capable of making that diagnosis, the social worker implicitly told the jury that the cause of that condition was the sexual assault that the victim said she had experienced three months before the victim visited the social worker and not any other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>cause. Without any support other than the victim\u2019s oral history, the social worker\u2019s diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder \u201cwas only a thinly veiled way of stating that [the victim] was telling the truth.\u201d <em>United States v. Whitted, </em>11 F.3d 782, 787 (8th Cir.1993). The social worker\u2019s testimony, offered by the Commonwealth in \u201ccorroboration\u201d of the victim\u2019s testimony, had no relevancy to the issues in this case other than to bolster the victim\u2019s credibility by revealing that the victim\u2019s version of events mirrored the therapist\u2019s descriptions and that the therapist believed the victim was telling the truth. <em>Davison, </em>18 Va.App. at 504, 445 S.E.2d at 688. Because <em>Davison </em>prohibits such evidence as comment upon an ultimate fact, the trial judge erred in admitting her testimony. <em>Id. </em>Thus, I would hold that the social worker\u2019s testimony impermissibly bolsters the victim\u2019s testimony, contrary to the ruling in <em>Davison.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b612-5\">None of the cases cited by the majority supports its conclusion that such testimony is admissible. While the victim\u2019s physical and mental condition may be admissible in a rape trial, <em>see Loving v. Commonwealth, </em>165 Va. 761, 182 S.E. 224 (1935), Taylor was not prosecuted for rape. In addition, in <em>Loving, </em>the doctor testified concerning the victim\u2019s physical and mental condition after the defense raised the issue during cross-examination of the victim. <em>Id. </em>at 765, 182 S.E. at 225. In this case, the prosecution, not Taylor, first interjected the victim\u2019s mental condition on direct examination of the victim. The majority\u2019s decision broadly approves the admission of a social worker\u2019s testimony recounting a victim\u2019s statements made three months after an event.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-6\">The expert testimony in both <em>Elam v. Commonwealth, </em>229 Va. 113, 326 S.E.2d 685 (1985), and <em>Tuggle v. Commonwealth, </em>228 Va. 493, 323 S.E.2d 539 (1984), <em>vacated and remanded on other grounds, </em>471 U.S. 1096, 105 S.Ct. 2315, 85 L.Ed.2d 835 (1985), concerned physical injuries as evidence of rape. In <em>Elam, </em>the Court allowed medical evidence of the tearing of skin to prove penetration when the victim did not know whether the assailant had raped her during the assault. 229 Va. at 115, 326 S.E.2d at 686-87. In <em>Tuggle, </em>the Common<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>wealth introduced medical evidence to prove that the dead victim had been raped during the commission of murder. 228 Va. at 510-11, 323 S.E.2d at 549.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-5\">Nothing in <em>Loving, Elam, </em>or <em>Tuggle </em>sanctions the result reached in this case. Here, a social worker recounted a person\u2019s complaint that the person was a victim of the crime at issue and, thus, bolstered the person\u2019s credibility and promoted the veracity of the victim in a manner not heretofore approved in Virginia. The social worker\u2019s testimony was \u201cno more than [the victim\u2019s] testimony dressed up and sanctified as the opinion of an expert.\u201d <em>Viterbo v. Dow Chemical Co., </em>826 F.2d 420, 424 (5th Cir.1987). \u201cThe [social worker] corroborated [the victim\u2019s] story under the guise of a scientific diagnosis and effectively told the jury [the defendant] had committed a crime.\u201d <em>Whitted, </em>11 F.3d at 787. I would hold the evidence inadmissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-6\">Moreover, Virginia law recognizes no exception to the hearsay rule that would permit a social worker to testify concerning a complainant\u2019s statement, made three months after an incident, that the complainant was a victim of the particular crime being prosecuted. In <em>Cartera v. Commonwealth, </em>219 Va. 516, 248 S.E.2d 784 (1978), the Supreme Court of Virginia \u201cacknowledge^] the exception to the hearsay rule\u201d that renders admissible statements made to physicians \u201cconcerning [a patient\u2019s] \u2018past pain, suffering and subjective symptoms\u2019 to show \u2018the basis of the physician\u2019s opinion as to the nature of the injuries or illness.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 518, 248 S.E.2d at 786. <em>See also Mackall v. Commonwealth, </em>236 Va. 240, 372 S.E.2d 759 (1988), <em>cert, denied, </em>492 U.S. 925, 109 S.Ct. 3261, 106 L.Ed.2d 607 (1989). The Court in <em>Cartera </em>declined, however, to apply the exception to statements \u201cconcerning the circumstances of the offenses and the description of the assailant\u201d made by the rape victims. 219 Va. at 518, 248 S.E.2d at 785. The Court declined to do so because \u201c[t]his testimony goes beyond a recital of \u2018past pain, suffering and subjective symptoms.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 518, 248 S.E.2d at 786.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>The testimony that the trial judge admitted in this case is analogous to the testimony the Supreme Court barred in <em>Cartera. </em>The social worker\u2019s testimony that the victim told her she had been the victim of a \u201csexual assault\u201d was hearsay evidence of the circumstances of the particular offense. As in <em>Cartera, </em>the statement was a description of events related to the alleged offense and not a statement of symptoms. Thus, for this reason, I would also hold that the trial judge erred in admitting the social worker\u2019s testimony that the victim said she had been sexually abused.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
