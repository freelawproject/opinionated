Verdict, guilty.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b30-9\">At the trial the accused introduced testimony to prove that the automatic revolver which he at the time of his arrest admitted he was carrying in his pocket, containing seven cartridges, was defective and could not be discharged.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b30-10\">At the close of the testimony, counsel for defendant, prayed the court to charge the jury that, if they believed the weapon was defective and could not have been discharged, they find a verdict of not guilty.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b30-11\">The Deputy Attorney General contended, first, that the. evidence in the case was not sufficient to establish the fact that the revolver was defective; and, second, that even if it was so established, this court has recently held that an unloaded revolver is a deadly weapon within the meaning of the act; and used language which showed an intention to apply the same rule to a defective weapon\u2014citing <em>State v.

Quail, </em>5 <em>Boyce </em>310, 92 <em>Atl. </em>859, tried last year in Kent County, the defense being that the revolver was unloaded, this court said, among other things:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b31-8\">\u201cWe think that a revolver, even though * * * in such a defective condition that it could not be fired, cannot be lawfully carried in this state concealed upon the person.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b31-10\">We adhere to this decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-11\">In view of the admissions, we think it unnecessary to say more.
