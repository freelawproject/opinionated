McWharter.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b169-16\">The plaintiff below declared in assumpsit on a special contract and also on the common counts. The defendant below filed the usual pleas, and a special plea, the substance of which was that:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b169-17\">at the time of the making \u00abof the alleged contract with the plaintiff below, in the month, * * * and at and during the time the alleged work was done by the plaintiff below, * * * the said plaintiff below was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>engaged in the business of plumbing in the City of Wilmington, Delaware, and in the production, manufacture or furnishing of goods, wares and merchandise used in the trade and business of plumbing, and had not applied for, paid for or received a state license from the State of Delaware * * * for the carrying on of its business as plumber or plumbing, * * * as * * * it was required so to do by virtue of the laws of the State of Delaware. * * *</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b170-8\">The plaintiff below filed a general demurrer to the special plea, relying upon <em>Model Heating Co. v. Magarity, 2 Boyce, </em>459, 81 <em>Atl. </em>394, L. <em>R. A. </em>1915B, 665; <em>Strout &amp; Co. v. Howell, </em>4 <em>Boyce </em>31, 85 <em>Atl. </em>666; <em>In re Bunch Co. </em>(D. <em>C.) </em>180 <em>Fed. </em>527; 25 <em>Cyc. </em>633; 1 <em>Elliott on Contr. </em>\u00a7 267; <em>Auson on Cont. </em>226; <em>Lamed v.

Blaisdell, </em>41 <em>Vt. </em>655.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b170-9\">In support of the plea, counsel for defendant below relied upon <em>Adams\u2019 Adm\u2019r v. Stewart, </em>5 <em>Harr. </em>144; <em>Reeder v. Jones, </em>6 <em>Penn. 66, </em>65 <em>Atl. </em>571; <em>Strout Co. v. Howell, supra; Model Heating Co. v. Magarity, supra; Cook v. Pierce, 2 Houst. </em>499; <em>Gregory v. Bailey, </em>4 <em>Harr. </em>256; 25 <em>Cyc. </em>633.</summary>\n<disposition data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"disposition\" id=\"b170-10\">Demurrer overruled.</disposition>\n<opinion data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b170-11\">Conrad, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AfL\">delivering the opinion of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-12\">The defendant\u2019s plea in this case alleges that plaintiff is not entitled to recover because, at the time of performing the services and furnishing the materials for which the suit is brought, the plaintiff had failed to obtain a license for carrying on the business or occupation of a plumber, as provided by the statute of this state. To this plea the plaintiff demurs.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-13\">The court is clearly of opinion that the case of <em>Strout v. Howell, </em>4 <em>Boyce </em>31, 85 <em>Atl. 666, </em>decided by the Supreme Court of this state in 1913, conclusively settles the law in the pending case. The <em>Model Heating Company case </em>turned upon another principle and can readily be reconciled with the <em>Strout-Howell case.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b170-14\">We are fully satisfied, and so decide, that in Delaware a contract cannot be enforced by a party who has failed to obtain a license to do business, or carry on an occupation as provided by the statute of the state, if that defense is pleaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-15\">The demurrer is overruled.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
