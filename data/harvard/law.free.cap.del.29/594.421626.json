Lankford was indicted for an assault upon Alice M. Lankford, his wife. Verdict guilty.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b604-17\">At the trial, the wife testified that she and the accused were married June 10th, 1916;-that about the first of March following, she began suffering in her private parts, and asked her husband what ailed her; that he told her she had ulcers, and he got some medicine for her but she could not take it. He told her she would get well, if she waited awhile, which she did, but her ailment grew worse; that the latter part of the month or the first of April she consulted a physician and learned that she had syphilis; that from the time of her marriage until she learned that she was infected she had lived with her husband an that he had continued to have sexual relations with her until March after their marriage. A physician testified for the state that he had been .consulted by the accused, the latter part of November or the first of December, 1916, and that, on finding he had syphilis, he informed the accused of the nature of his malady.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b604-18\">The husband admitted that his wife contracted syphilis from him and that he did not tell her that he was suffering with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>disease until she had learned that she was suffering with it; but contended that he had contracted the disease about nine months before his marriage, at which time he supposed himself to have been cured; that some time in October, following his marriage, he consulted a physician and became aware that he still had the disease; and that from that time he did not have sexual intercourse with his wife.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b605-6\">The court was requested on behalf of the state, to instruct the jury that if they should believe that the accused, knowing that he was infected with a venereal disease, syphilis, and without informing his wife of the fact had sexual intercourse with her after such knowledge had been communicated to him, and thereby infected her with the disease, he would be guilty of assault. The fraud practiced upon the wife would abrogate any consent) she might give for sexual intercourse, as it cannot be supposed that a wife would consent to sexual intercourse with her husband if she knew that he was infected with a disease such as syphilis. <em>Reg. v.

A husband, therefore, knowing that he has such a disease, and concealing the fact from his wife, by accepting her consent, and communicating the infection to her, inflicts on her physical abuse, and injury, resulting in great bodily harm; and he becomes, notwithstanding his marital rights, guilty of an assault, and indeed, a completed battery. 2 <em>Bish.
