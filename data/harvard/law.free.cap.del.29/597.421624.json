The court is of opinion that to charge a sale in more than one place in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>single count would be fatally defective, but it appears by the language used that it was intended to charge the defendant with a sale at a single place, known as the store or warehouse, and if there is any repugnancy in the indictment it can only show as a variance after the trial of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-5\"><bracketnum>[2-4]</bracketnum> The second contention is that the allegation of the sale of \u201cintoxicating liquor, to wit, beer,\u201d is insufficient. In the opinion of the court the word \u201cbeer\u201d without restriction or qualification denotes an intoxicating malt liquor and is within the meaning of the words \u201cintoxicating liquor\u201d, and the use of the word \u201cbeer\u201d alone Jin an indictment charging the unlawful sale of intoxicating liquor is presumed to include only that species of beverage. The court will take judicial notice, under our statute, of the fact that \u201cbeer\u201d is the usual name for a malt liquor, and that it is intoxicating, and a charge of an alleged sale of intoxicating liquor is sustained by proof of the sale of beer, without any further description or testimony that it was intoxicating.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-6\">Demurrer overruled.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
