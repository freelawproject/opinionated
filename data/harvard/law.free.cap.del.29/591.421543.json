Upon this prayer,</p>\n<author id=\"b602-9\">Conrad, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"A9N\">charged the jury:</p>\n<p id=\"b602-10\">The prisoner at the bar, Peter Greco, is charged in this indictment with the embezzlement of one stick pin, laid as the property of George Stevens.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-11\">In this indictment the value of the stick pin is not alleged, and no attempt was made to prove that. So far as that question is concerned the value of the property converted is not an element of the crime of embezzlement, and the fa\u00ed\u00edpfe to prove value is not a sufficient ground for instructing the jury to find a verdict of not guilty. We consider the matter of the value of the property immaterial here.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-12\">Verdict, guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-13\">Whereupon there was a motion for a new trial and in arrest of judgment on the grounds: (1) That the verdict was against the evidence and against the law. (2) That the court erred: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>(a) In charging the jury that \u201cin this indictment the value of the stick pin is not alleged and no attempt was made to prove that. So far as that question is concerned the value of the property converted is not an element of the crime of embezzlement, and the failure to prove the value is not a sufficient ground for instructing the jury to find a verdict of not guilty. We consider the matter of the value of the property immaterial here.\u201d (b) That \u201cthis court has defined the crime of embezzlement to be a fraudulent appropriation of another\u2019s property by a person to whom it is entrusted or into whose hands it has lawfully come.\u201d (c) That \u201cthe duty is upon the state to prove in this matter of embezzlement the essential elements of the crime, that is, it should prove the main, essential elements that go to make up the crime, which is the wrongful conversion of something entrusted to another.\u201d (3) That the indictment shows on its face that no crime was committed in violation of any law of the State of Delaware. (4) That the indictment fails to show on its face that the property alleged to have been embezzled was the subject of larceny as contemplated by <em>Rev. Code </em>1915, \u00a74749.</p>\n<author id=\"b603-5\">Conrad, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AWl\">delivering the opinion of the court:</p>\n<p id=\"b603-6\">A review of the briefs filed in this case and on which argument was made on the motion for a new trial and in arrest of judgment convinces the court that no mistake was made by the court in its rulings in the case on the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-7\">The cases cited by the state are conclusive in settling the law thatono value need be alleged nor proven in indictments for embezzlement, as value is in no way an essential ingredient or element of the crime charged. The allegation under the indictment in this case was \u201cthe embezzlement of certain personal property, to wit, an article of jewelry, commonly called a stick pin\u201d; and this was clearly an allegation of \u201cproperty the subject of larceny,\u201d and sufficient to satisfy the wording of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-8\">The motion for a new trial and in arrest of judgment is refused.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
