The evidence is that the application was signed about noon of the day of its date, and that about 7:30 o\u2019clock in the evening of the same day the defendant sent the following telegram:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>\u201cKenton, Del. 8/2/15.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-5\">\u201cThe Montray Realty Co.,.200 Fifth Ave., New York., N.

The cases relied on are the following: <em>Brogden v. Metropolitan Ry. Co., L. R. </em>2 A. <em>C. </em>666; <em>Hebbs Case, </em>4 <em>Equity Cas. </em>9; <em>McCully\u2019s Adm\u2019r v.

E. Underhill,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-8\">\u2018 \u2018 Representative.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b375-9\">It was also contended \u201cthat the defendant made full settlement under the contract by giving his note for $1675, and also by the testimony of Underhill, the representative of the plaintiff company, that he then closed the deal with the defendant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b375-10\">The language of the application is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-11\">\u201cI hereby make application for,\u201d etc. \u201c* * * I agree to pay for lots $1875 payable $200; $100 in note sixty days, with application.

Until acceptance by the plaintiff company and notification thereof to the defendant, the latter was at liberty to cancel or withdraw his application, and have a return of his check and notes given in the transaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-11\">The defendant revoked his proffer before acceptance. We are therefore constrained to instruct the jury to return a verdict for defendant.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
