It does not appear whether it was in the jurisdiction of Maryland or Virginia. The second count sets out the place as in the State of Maryland, without setting up a fictitious venue, to wit, New Castle County.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b362-18\">The third count omits venue. The point of the demurrer is that the declaration in no part sets out the jurisdictional venue.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b362-19\">Mr. Willis, in reply, cited the following authorities in opposition to the contention of the defendant: <em>Section </em>15, <em>Rev. Code </em>1915, <em>Par. </em>4178; <em>Chitty\u2019s Plead, </em>267-269; <em>Hammer v. Pierce, </em>5 <em>Harr. </em>304; 40 <em>Cyc. </em>105.</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b362-20\">Heisel, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"Amk\">delivering the opinion of the court:</p>\n<p id=\"b362-21\">This is an action for personal injuries; the allegations of the <em>narr. </em>being that the tort was committed on the Chesapeake Bay <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>within the State of Maryland, and nowhere lays the venue in this county.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">The defendant demurred to the declaration, and alleged as grounds of demurrer the failure to lay the venue in this county.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-6\">In actions of this character, in a court of general jurisdiction, the place is not material or traversable (1 <em>Chit, on Pleading, </em>260, 268, 394; 1 <em>Woolley on Del. Prac., </em>\u00a7 349), and therefore within, the provisions of <em>Section </em>4178 of the <em>Code, </em>which is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-7\">\u201cIt shall not be deemed necessary, in any declaration, or other pleading, to lay the venue in the county in which the action is brought, nor to set forth in any maimer the place in which an-act is alleged to have been done, unless when, from the nature of the case, the place may be material, or traversable.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b363-8\">The demurrer is overruled.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
