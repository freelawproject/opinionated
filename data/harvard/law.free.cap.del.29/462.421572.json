Code </em>1915, \u00a74006, in case of a forthwith summons; (2) that the justice set down the day of the return of the forthwith summons in the docket as required by <em>Rev. Code </em>1915, \u00a7 4028; it does appear by the record (3) that the judgment given by the justice was not for a sum certain, in that the judgment was given \u201cfor thirty-six dollars with interest from the first day of May, A. D. 1916; (4) that the judgment was given in an amount larger than the amount demanded, in that, judgment was given for. * * *\u201d</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b473-7\">Boyce, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AVc\">delivering the opinion of the court:</p>\n<p id=\"b473-8\"><bracketnum>[1]</bracketnum> It is true that the transcript of the docket entries filed in this case does not show that the oath required by the statute, before issuing a forthwith summons, was made; yet the transcript sent up is aided by having attached thereto the affidavit which was made as required by the statute, and also the summons with the return verified. The transcript does show that the defendant was served personally, and that he appeared on the day the summons issued; and also that on the same day the \u201cplaintiff and defendant being present\u201d the justice proceeded with the trial without objection on the part of the defendant, and gave judgment in favor of the plaintiff. Independent of the affidavit attached to the transcript, the appearance of the defendant, and the trial going on without his excepting to it, cured the defect relied on by the first exception. <em>Bishop v. Carpenter, </em>1 <em>Houst. </em>526.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> <em>Rev. Code </em>1915, \u00a7 4028, requires the justice to make certain entries in his docket, among them being \u201cthe day of issuing-process and when it is returnable, the return, and in case of a. \u2018forthwith\u2019 summons the day of the return.\u201d The transcript of the record in this case does not disclose the day of the return. Ordinarily the record is bad unless it show the return of the summons and the day of the return. But the summons here, duly verified and attached to the transcript of the record, does show return and day of return, being the day it was issued. On the same day the trial was had with the defendant present and judgment was entered. The record sent up shows a substantial compliance with the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-5\">This court has held that a judgment for a certain sum with interest thereon from a date prior to the bringing of the action, without being ascertained and included in the sum for which the judgment is entered, is sufficient as for a sum certain. <em>Robinson v.
