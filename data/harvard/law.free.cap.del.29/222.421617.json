The defendant appealed to the Superior Court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b233-7\">Counsel for the plaintiff moved to dismiss the appeal upon the ground that the transcript filed failed to show that the set-off of the defendant was disallowed or defalked by the referees, claiming, therefore, that an appeal would not lie.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b233-8\">The cases of <em>Pepper v. Warren, </em>2 <em>Marv. </em>225, 43 <em>Ail. </em>91, and <em>Burris v. Boone, </em>4 <em>Boyce </em>148, 86 <em>Ail. </em>730, were relied upon in support of the motion.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b233-9\">Counsel for the defendant contended that the cases cited are not applicable to the facts of this case, because the defendant not only pleaded his set-off, but, appearing, the referees heard his proofs and allegations and that the legal inference is they disallowed his claim.</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b233-10\">Boyce, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"Ars\">delivering the opinion of the court:</p>\n<p id=\"b233-11\">\u201cAppeals shall be allowed from judgments, given by justices of the peace, to the Superior Court, as follows: <em>First, </em>from every judgment given by the justice, without referee trial, to an amount exceeding five dollars, exclusive of costs, the party against whom such judgment shall be given, may appeal; or in case any part of the plaintiff\u2019s demand, or of the defendant\u2019s counter-claim or set-off, exceeding five dollars, is disallowed or defalked by the justice, such plaintiff or defendant, may appeal; <em>second, </em>from every judgment given, upon the report of referees, to an amount exceeding fifteen dollars, exclusive of costs, the party against whom <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>such judgment is given, may appeal; or in case any part of the plaintiff\u2019s demand or of the defendant\u2019s counter-claim or set-off, exceeding fifteen dollars, is disallowed or defalked, such plaintiff, or defendant, may appeal.\u201d <em>Rev. Code </em>1915, \u00a7 4034.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-6\">As was said in <em>Pepper v. Warren, </em>2 <em>Marv. </em>225, 43 <em>Atl. </em>91, and adhered to in <em>Burris v. Boone, </em>4 <em>Boyce, </em>148, 86 <em>Atl. </em>730:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-7\">\u201cThe meaning of 1 defalked \u2019 is a lopping off, or a reduction, to some extent, of a claim which is proved, whether it be from a claim made and proved by the plaintiff, or from a set-off made and proved by the defendant. * * \u201cSo that where it may appear to our satisfaction\u2014that is, sufficiently in legal contemplation\u2014that the plaintiff has stated the amount of his claim * * * and the justice after hearing the proofs and allegations on both sides has rendered a judgment in favor of the defendant for costs, and thus rejected the claim of the plaintiff, in the language of the statute, disallowed his claim, to an amount exceeding five dollars; in such case an appeal will lie to this court.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b234-8\">It was held in <em>Fanning v. Miller, </em>4 <em>Boyce, </em>527, 89 <em>Atl. </em>737, that\u2014</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-9\">\u201cthe fact of a disallowance or lopping off of such a claim must be disclosed by the record, either in the form of an affirmative statement to that effect, or by statements in the record from which such fact may be conclusively deduced.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b234-10\">In that case the record disclosed that after the plea of set-off was filed nothing further was done with it; that testimony was heard by the referees in support of the plaintiff\u2019s claim alone, and that the matter of the defendant\u2019s counter-claim or set-off was neither presented to, considered, disallowed or defalked by the referees. The appeal was dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-11\">In the case now before the court, the defendant brought forward his account against the plaintiff and pleaded it as a set-off, as he was required to do, in order to prevent his being forever barred from recovering the same. The referees, notwithstanding the defendant\u2019s plea of set-off and the proofs and allegations of both parties, found for the plaintiff for the full amount of his demand, thereby rejecting the defendant\u2019s counter-claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-12\">It is the- opinion of the court that this case is clearly distinguished from the <em>Fanning case, </em>and that the reasonable inference to be drawn from the statement in the record or transcript <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>filed is that the referees heard the allegations and proofs of the parties as to their respective claims, and disallowed the defendant\u2019s claim, which being in excess of fifteen dollars, the appeal should be allowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">The motion to dismiss is denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
