Jarrell and Beulah Jarrell.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b378-19\">The evidence produced by the state showed that certain articles belonged to Lewis L.

This motion was refused,\u2014and a verdict of guilty rendered against the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b379-5\">The defendant now moves for a new trial on the ground that the court erred in refusing the motion for instructions on the ground of a variance.</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b379-6\">Conrad, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AMF\"><bracketnum>[1]</bracketnum> The court on reflection and after examining the authorities cited by defendant\u2019s counsel is satisfied that the indictment having charged joint ownership it was incumbent upon the state to prove that the goods in question were held in joint ownership, by the two individuals as whose property they were laid.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-7\">The proof was clearly of ownership in severalty and did not sustain the allegations of the indictment. The question of ownership is material and must be proven as alleged.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-8\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> <em>Section </em>4830 of the <em>Revised Code </em>1915 has no bearing upon the case at bar. It provides that, where property belongs to more than one person, the indictment may name but one of them, but in the pending case there was no evidence that any of the property belonged to more than one person.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-9\">The case of <em>Widner v. State, </em>25 <em>Ind. </em>234, and <em>State v. Ellison, </em>58 <em>N. H. </em>325, uphold the contention made by defendant\u2019s counsel.
