So the next night I told Mr. Donovan to come down with me to the buildings, for I did not know anything about firing those buildings, etc.; and he went down there with me and showed me how he could do it, and he told me he would furnish five gallons of oil. There was a man concealed in the building to hear what he said. So after we went in the building, of course I had to ask him some questions to get evidence, and I said to him, \u2018 Don\u2019t you think a job like this is worth fifty dollars ? \u2019 He paused for a moment, and said, \u2018 I will split the difference with you.\u2019 It seemed as though he lost his nerve then, and he said, \u2018We will go out of here,\u2019 and that was all.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b53-13\">The testimony as to the solicitation on the second night in the building was corroborated by one T., who was concealed in the building and overheard the conversation between C. and Donovan.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b53-14\">At the conclusion of the state\u2019s testimony, counsel for defendant asked the court to instruct the jury to render a verdict of not guilty, because the indictment alleges that the accused attempted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>to procure one Collins feloniously and willfully and unlawfully to set on fire a certain warehouse then and there the property of the Smith Manufacturing Company, with intent of him the said Donovan then and there and thereby to injure the said Smith Manufacturing Company, and the state has not proven who or what the Smith Manufacturing Company is; if it is composed of individuals they must prove the name of the individuals, and if it is a corporation, they must prove the name of the corporation. This is an offense against a third person. The Smith Manufacturing Company does not convey any meaning whatsoever. There must be some proof, however slight, of the corporate character of the third person. <em>State v. Rue, </em>72 <em>Minn. </em>296, 75 <em>N. W. </em>235; <em>Bailey v.

Generally when the name in which the property is laid imports an incorporation such fact will be presumed. Where the name of a corporation is stated as owner, there need be no averment that it is a corporation. <em>State v.
