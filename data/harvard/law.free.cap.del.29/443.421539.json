In case a misdemeanor is alleged to have been done feloniously, the allegation is surplusage, contrary to <em>State v. Darrah, Houst. Cr. Cas. </em>112, and should be rejected as such, if the indictment, or count, is otherwise good. <em>Com. v. Squire, </em>1 <em>Metc. (Mass.) </em>258; <em>State v. Edwards, </em>90 <em>N.
