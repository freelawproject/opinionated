D. 1913, leaving unrevoked her last will and testament with a codicil thereto annexed, each made some years theretofore, which were, after the death of the testatrix, duly admitted to probate by the then register of wills for Kent County, and letters testamentary were granted to the said Robert H.

That the testatrix, in and by her will made a bequest, as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b63-12\">\u201cForty-second,\u2014I give and bequeath the sum of five thousand dollars ($5,000) to the Conference Claimant\u2019s Fund of the Wilmington Conference of the Methodist Episcopal Church.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b63-13\">And also therein made a further bequest, as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b63-14\">\u201c Forty-third,\u2014It is my will, and I do direct that if after the payment of all legacies, expenses and costs incident to the settlement of my estate, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>there should remain a residuary estate of twenty thousand dollars ($20,000.00) or more, then and in that event. * * * And I give and bequeath the sum of one thousand dollars ($1,000) to the Conference Claimant\u2019s Fund of the Wilmington Conference of the Methodist Episcopal Church, in addition to the bequest of five thousand dollars ($5,000) contained in item forty-second of this my last will and testament.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b64-5\">That there is no corporation known by the corporate name of \u201cConference Claimant\u2019s Fund of the Wilmington Conference of the Methodist Episcopal Church,\u201d but that there is a fund of the Wilmington Conference of the Methodist Episcopal Church officially and familiarly known as the \u201cConference Claimant\u2019s Fund of the Wilmington Conference of the Methodist Episcopal Church\u201d; and, that the custodian and party entitled to the possession of all moneys belonging to that fund is \u201cthe Board of Stewards of the Wilmington Conference of the Methodist Episcopal Church,\u201d a corporation existing under the laws of the State of Delaware, the plaintiff in this action. That the plaintiff corporation was organized under a public act (set forth in the case sated) passed at Dover, Delaware, April 1, 1869, which was re-enacted and extended (set forth in the case stated) March 29, 1889, that the certificate of the renewal of said charter (set forth in the case stated) was duly filed under the provisions of an act of the General Assembly, entitled \u201cAn act providing a General Incorporation Law,\u201d approved March 10, 1899 (21 <em>Del. </em>Laws, <em>c. </em>273), and the acts amendatory thereof and supplemental thereto, and recorded in the office of the recorder of deeds, in and for Kent County, etc. That the property, funds and assets held at the present time by the said \u201cthe Board of Stewards of the Wilmingtori Conference of the Methodist Episcopal Church\u201d is twenty-four thousand three hundred and sixty-two dollars.

Annual conferences are authorized, to establish and maintain investment funds, preachers\u2019 aid societies, and organizations and funds of similar character under such names, plans, rules, and regulations as they may determine, the income from which shall .be applied to the support of conference claimants. It is recommended that each annual conference provide an incorporated board to administer its permanent funds.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b64-7\">That in pursuance thereof, \u201cthe Board of Stewards of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>Wilmington Conference of the Methodist Episcopal Church\u201d was incorporated and organized for the sole purpose of receiving, holding, investing and disbursing property and funds for the benefit of the disciplinary claimants known as \u201cConference Claimants of the Wilmington Conference of the Methodist Episcopal Church.\u201d That there is no other fund known as the \u201c Conference Claimant\u2019s Fund of the Wilmington Conference of the Methodist Episcopal Church,\u201d except the fund received, held, invested and disbursed by the plaintiff corporation; that the only moneys or property received, held, invested and disbursed by the plaintiff corporation are funds officially and familiarly known as the \u201cConference Claimant\u2019s Fund,\u201d etc., and that said fund is to provide for the maintenance and'\"support of retired ministers, and widows of deceased ministers of said denomination, and their children, under sixteen years ofi age, of said Wilmington Conference and are designated Conference Claimants, that in a campaign conducted prior to the death of the testatrix, by the said Y/ilmington Conference to increase the endowment of the \u201cConference Claimant\u2019s Fund,\u201d etc., the same was conducted in the name of said \u201cConference Claimant\u2019s Fund,\u201d etc., by which name it is known in the conference benevolences. That the testatrix gave a donation of one thousand five hundred dollars to said fund at that time, which was paid by her to the plaintiff corporation, and she was a constant contributor thereto. That after the payment of all legacies given by the said last will and testament, except those mentioned in the forty-third item thereof, all expenses and costs, incident to the settlement of the estate of the testatrix, there will remain a residuary estate of twenty thousand and more. That the personal estate of the testatrix is ample and sufficient to pay all the bequests made by her, including both the bequest of five thousand dollars and the additional bequest of one thousand dollars given unto the said \u201cConference Claimant\u2019s Fund,\u201d etc., without selling any of the real estate for the purpose of paying said bequests. That the said bequest of five thousand dollars and the said additional bequest of one thousand dollars was not directed to be laid out in real estate. That the only direction as to the sale of real estate is contained in the forty-seventh item. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>or residuary clause of the will (set forth in the case stated), in favor of certain beneficiaries. That if the court shall be of the opinion that the said legacy of five thousand dollars and the additional legacy of one thousand dollars, each bequeathed to the \u201cConference Claimant\u2019s Fund of the Wilmington Conference of the Methodist Episcopal Church,\u201d are due and payable to the plaintiff corporation, then judgment shall be entered for the plaintiff for the sum of six thousand dollars, besides costs of suit, otherwise judgment shall be entered for the defendant.

She may have used the name of the fund as indicating the persons whom she desired to benefit, \u201cConfer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>ence Claimants\u201d, rather than the name of the plaintiff which perhaps she did not know administered the fund.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b67-4\">An erroneous name will not avoid a bequest if it is possible by means of the name used or by extrinsic.evidence to identify the corporation intended as beneficiary with sufficient certainty. <em>Page on Wills, </em>\u00a7 539, <em>p. </em>622; 6 <em>Cyc. </em>944; 1 <em>Jarman on Wills p. </em>411, note, and numerous cases cited thereunder; <em>Doughten v.
