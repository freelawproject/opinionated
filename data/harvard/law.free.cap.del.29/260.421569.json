Collins was indicted under <em>Section </em>4712, <em>Rev. Code </em>1915, for assaulting, striking and beating his wife. It was shown by the prosecutrix that she and the accused were joined together in the bonds of matrimony, .prior to the assault, and that they thereafter lived and cohabited together as husband and wife, and were known as such to their relatives and friends. The accused denied the marriage, but acknowledged that he had admitted the marriage and \u00e1lso that he and the prosecuting witness lived together as husband and wife at the time of the alleged assault; but denied having made any assault upon her. He claimed that he was the lawful husband of another woman. Verdict guilty. Motion made for new trial.</summary>\n<disposition data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"disposition\" id=\"AgZT\">Denied.</disposition>\n<opinion data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b270-15\">Boyce, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"Alb\">charging the jury, in part:</p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number><bracketnum>[1]</bracketnum> <em>Section </em>4712, <em>Rev.

The marriage solemnized in this case entitled the woman, and women like situated, to the protection afforded by the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-8\">It is the opinion' of the court, tinder the facts of the case, that a new trial should be denied, and that judgment of the court should follow the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-9\">The motion is denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
