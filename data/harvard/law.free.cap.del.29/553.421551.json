The judgment was obtained at the March term, 1916, by Charles W. Jefferson, plaintiff, against James I. Padley, the defendant, being No. 446 to that term. Under a former <em>fi. fa. </em>a levy had been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>made and the goods afterwards sold for an amount less than the amount of the judgment.</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b564-5\">\n<em>Per Curiam:</em>\n</author>\n<p id=\"A4H\">At one time in this state, under such circumstances, it was necessary to issue the <em>alias </em>or <em>pluries fi. fa. </em>in the form of a <em>fi. fa. </em>for the residue. <em>Fiddleman v. </em>Biddle, 1 <em>Harr. </em>500. However, this practice has been changed for many years and it is now sufficient if the <em>alias </em>or <em>pluries </em>writ issues in the general form of an <em>alias </em>or <em>pluries fi. fa. Woolley </em>on <em>Del. Practice, </em>\u00a7 1002.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-6\">As the form of the writ issued in this case follows the established practice, we are of the opinion that it should not be quashed. The court therefore refuse the motion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
