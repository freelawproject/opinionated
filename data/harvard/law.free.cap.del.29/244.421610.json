The issue coming on to be heard before the referees, and after hearing the allegations and proofs of the plaintiff, counsel for the defendant moved for a nonsuit.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b254-19\">The referees reported that:</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b255-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>\u201c * * * After having heard the allegations of the plaintiff and his proofs, and maturely considering the same, do report that we find there is no just demand for rent as shown by the plaintiff * * * and hereby render a verdict of nonsuit.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b255-8\">Thereupon the justice entered the following judgment:</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b255-9\">\u201cAnd now to wit, etc., upon the report of said referees, judgment for nonsuit is hereby given against Daniel Scanlon, the plaintiff, in favor of Edward Cohee, the defendant, and further judgment is hereby given against * * * the plaintiff in favor of * * * the defendant for the sum of thirty-two dollars and five cents as his costs in this proceeding.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b255-11\">The exceptions were to the effect that the referees could not render such a verdict as they did, and that the judgment entered thereon is invalid.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b255-12\">The contention was made that the verdict of the refrees was inconsistent with the requirement of the statute that they should ascertain whether there be a just demand of rent and the amount thereof.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b255-13\">Counsel for the defendant relied upon <em>Wright v.
