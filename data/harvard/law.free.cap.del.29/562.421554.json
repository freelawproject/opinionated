Short. On motion at dose of plaintiff\u2019s testimony for nonsuit. Granted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b573-7\">The action was for an alleged breach of contract, entered into between Emil P. Gebhart and the defendant for furnishing lumber by the latter to the former, for the erection of a certain building in the town of Milford, Sussex Count;?.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b573-8\">After some deliveries of the lumber had been made to Gebhart, he assigned the contract to the plaintiff, giving Short notice of the assignment. Short made subsequent deliveries; but failing, it being claimed, to comply with his contract by delivering the lumber as required in the construction of the building, the Milford Company rescinded the contract and bought lumber in the open market to complete the building. The Milford Company, in its own name, sued Short for damages and declared on the assigned, contract. At the close of plaintiff\u2019s testimony, counsel for defendant moved for non-suit on the ground that an action at law could not be brought for the alleged breach of the contract in the name of the assignee, but must be maintained in the name of the assignor as the holder of the legal right or title.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b573-9\">It was contended for the plaintiff that the evidence showed a novation of the contract between all the parties, or a new contract between Short and the plaintiff such as to entitle the latter to sue in its own name.</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b573-10\">Boyce, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AqxR\">delivering the opinion of the court:</p>\n<p id=\"b573-11\"><bracketnum>[1, 2]</bracketnum> Both on the pleadings and from the evidence, this is an action for the breach of a contract for the purchase of lumber on the part of Emil P. Gebhart and the sale and delivery thereof to Gebhart, on the part of Isaac D. Short, the defendant, for the erection of a certain building. The contract was subsequently assigned by Gebhart to the Milford Company, the plaintiff, with notice to Short. There is no proper suggestion in the declaration of a novation of the contract. The averment in the declaration is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b573-12\"><em>\u201c </em>* * * On the eighteenth day of July, A. D. 1912, the said Emil P. Gebhart by certain writing signed by him, bearing date the day, month and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>year last aforesaid, for valuable consideration, assigned, transferred, bargained and sold to the plaintiff all his right, title and interest under the said contract, whereof the said defendant on the same day, month and year aforesaid had notice.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b574-6\">It is not shown that the defendant agreed to the assignment, or that there was any new promise on his part to the plaintiff based on any consideration therefor from the plaintiff to the defendant, or that the liability of the latter to Gebhart was extinguished. <em>McKinney v. Alvis. </em>14 <em>Ill. </em>33; <em>Cole v. </em>Bodfish, 17 <em>Me. </em>310. It is scarcely necessary to say that proof of any other contract than that declared on constitutes a fatal variance.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-7\"><bracketnum>[3]</bracketnum> The contract sued on being a chose in action, was not assignable so as to entitle the plaintiff, the assignee, to maintain an action thereon in its own name for a breach thereof; for in such a case the \u00a1assignee must sue in the name of the assignor. 1 <em>Sound.
