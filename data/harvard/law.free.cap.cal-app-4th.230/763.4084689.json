The bases for its finding were defendant\u2019s \u201cnonstop criminal history\u201d that included violent felonies (two robberies), two escapes from confinement, an 18-year prison commitment, which he served, and upon his release, two arrests, one for brandishing a weapon, and the relatively recent timing of his current offense (receiving stolen property) in 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-12\">Defendant contends on appeal the Act is unconstitutionally vague because the term \u201cunreasonable risk of danger to public safety\u201d is not adequately defined.

These examples are: \u201c(1) The petitioner\u2019s criminal conviction history, including the type of crimes committed, the extent of injury to victims, the length of prior prison commitments, and the remoteness of the crimes; [][] (2) The petitioner\u2019s disciplinary record and record of rehabilitation while incarcerated; and [f] (3) Any other evidence the court, within its discretion, determines to be relevant in deciding whether a new sentence would result in an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety.\u201d (\u00a7 1170.126, subd. (g).)</p>\n<p id=\"b656-5\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b656-6\">Defendant\u2019s current offense for which he has been incarcerated under the three strikes law was receiving stolen property. It was committed in December 2007. He and his wife acted as lookouts while another person burglarized a home. When police tried to handcuff him, defendant attempted to pull free, requiring two officers to restrain him with pepper spray. Defendant had a stolen camera on him. Police found a stolen rifle in the orchard across the street from the burglarized home. Defendant was charged with first degree residential burglary, grand theft of a firearm, receiving stolen property, and some misdemeanors. He pled guilty to receiving stolen property and admitted prior strikes for a stipulated sentence of 25 years to life in prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-7\">Defendant\u2019s criminal history began about 30 years before, with felony receiving stolen property in 1980, for which he was placed on probation. A year later, in 1981, he committed second degree burglary and was sentenced to prison for 16 months. In February 1982, the month he was released, he was arrested and a month later pled guilty to robbery (his first strike) and sentenced to four years in prison. In 1984, he was convicted of unlawful driving/taking a vehicle and sentenced to two years in prison. The same year, he was also convicted of escape. In 1985, he was convicted of grand theft and sentenced to three years in prison. In 1988, he was convicted of assault on a peace officer, battery on a peace officer, and thereafter, with another escape, all resulting in another four years eight months in prison. Defendant violated parole and was returned to prison in 1991. When released on parole, he was arrested again in June 1991 and when released again, within months committed a first degree burglary (his second strike), a robbery (his third strike), and vehicle theft in 1992, which resulted in a total prison term of 18 years. He was released from prison in February 2003. Within nine months, in November 2003, defendant was arrested again. In August 2004, he brandished a weapon and was placed on probation for two years, including serving 180 days in jail. In January 2005 and January 2007, he violated that probation and was reincarcerated. Defendant was paroled in April 2007 and committed his current offense eight months later.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"767\">*767</page-number>Defendant\u2019s criminal history was preceded by his delinquency in 1979, for which he was committed to the California Youth Authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-5\">Defendant has been incarcerated for his current offense of receiving stolen property since December 2007. During this time, defendant has not been written up for prison misconduct. Once a validated member of a prison gang, defendant is now considered by prison officials to be a gang dropout. He has participated in Narcotics Anonymous, art therapy, anger management, education classes, and vocational training.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-6\">Defendant filed a petition for resentencing under the Act in February 2013. The People responded in writing that defendant was eligible for resentencing but that the court should not resentence him because he \u201cposes a completely unreasonable risk of danger to public safety.\u201d They also argued that if the court were \u201cinclined\u201d to resentence him, \u201cthe People instead would request that the original plea [be] withdrawn and the case ... set for trial on the original charges\u201d because they would \u201cno longer [be] getting the benefit of the bargain.\u201d Defendant then filed a supplemental petition detailing his record of rehabilitation since his current incarceration.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-7\">At the hearing on defendant\u2019s petition, the parties agreed that the burden of proof was with the People to prove by a preponderance of evidence that defendant posed an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety if released. The People relied on the evidence they had previously submitted to the court in their response to defendant\u2019s petition for resentencing that included defendant\u2019s \u201c969(b) packet,\u201d the preliminary examination transcript from the current offense, and the postsentencing report prepared by the probation department from the current offense. They \u201cacknowledge^] that while in prison, [defendant] has actually been exemplary\u201d but that \u201cdoes not change that he is an unreasonable risk of danger to the community.\u201d Defense counsel argued that defendant was now 51 years old and since being transferred to Mule Creek State Prison in December 2009, \u201che\u2019s worked very diligently toward rehabilitation in those last about three and a half years.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b657-8\">Before announcing its ruling, the court made some \u201cgeneral observations.\u201d Its job was to \u201cdetermine whether resentencing and obviously release would pose an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety. The problem is we\u2019re essentially being asked as courts to predict future dangerousness.\u201d \u201c[Wje\u2019ve developed a variety of tools that supposedly have made it easier to . . . predict future dangerousness, none of which is before the Court in this case,\u201d such as the \u201cStatic 99\u201d and a \u201cvariety of other . . . psychological evaluations.\u201d It was not \u201clost on any of us\u201d that \u201cwhen a person has been sentenced to a life term and comes to court . . . with almost a last grasp at hope for . . . <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"768\">*768</page-number>having their life handed back to them after being sentenced to a life sentence,\u201d \u201cit\u2019s an awesome responsibility on the parties\u201d and on the court to make that determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-5\">After making those observations, the court \u201cturn[ed] to what [it] ha[d] before [it].\u201d It was \u201csignificant\u201d that defendant had been discipline free for five years and that was one of the facts the court was \u201cdirected to consider.\u201d But defendant had a \u201cnonstop criminal history\u201d that included violent felonies, specifically, defendant\u2019s two robberies and two escapes from confinement. Although the court did not \u201crecall being made aware of any injuries to victims,\u201d \u201cany threat of violence to obtain property\u201d carries with it \u201cat least psychological injury.\u201d \u201c[0]f greatest concern\u201d was that shortly after serving an 18-year prison commitment, defendant exhibited a weapon. And defendant\u2019s current crime of receiving stolen property in 2007 was not remote. \u201cWeighing all of these factors\u201d defendant \u201cwould pose an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety\u201d and, thus, the court denied his petition for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-6\">Defendant timely appealed from that denial.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b658-8\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b658-9\">\n<em>The Term \u201cUnreasonable Risk of Danger to Public Safety\u201d Is Not Void for Vagueness</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b658-11\">Defendant contends that section 1170.126 is unconstitutionally vague because the term \u201cunreasonable risk of danger to public safety\u201d (\u00a7 1170.126, subd. (f)) is not defined. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-12\">\u201cThe constitutional interest implicated in questions of statutory vagueness is that no person be deprived of \u2018life, liberty, or property without due process of law,\u2019 as assured by both the federal Constitution (U.S. Const., Amends. V, XIV) and the California Constitution (Cal. Const., art. I, \u00a7 7).\u201d <em>(Williams v. Garcetti </em>(1993) 5 Cal.4th 561, 567 [20 Cal.Rptr.2d 341, 853 P.2d 507].) \u201cAll presumptions and intendments favor the validity of a statute and mere doubt does not afford sufficient reason for a judicial declaration of invalidity. Statutes must be upheld unless their unconstitutionality clearly, positively and unmistakably appears.\u201d <em>(Lockheed Aircraft Corp. v. Superior Court </em>(1946) 28 Cal.2d 481, 484 [171 P.2d 21].)</p>\n<p id=\"b658-13\">Defendant fails to satisfy this demanding standard. Under the Act, a defendant who is not otherwise ineligible for resentencing \u201cshall be resentenced . . . unless the court, in its discretion, determines that resentencing the petitioner would pose an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety.\u201d (\u00a7 1170.126, subd. (f).)</p>\n<p id=\"b659-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"769\">*769</page-number>\u201cIn exercising its discretion in subdivision (f), the court may consider:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b659-5\">\u201c(1) The petitioner\u2019s criminal conviction history, including the type of crimes committed, the extent of injury to victims, the length of prior prison commitments, and the remoteness of the crimes;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b659-6\">\u201c(2) The petitioner\u2019s disciplinary record and record of rehabilitation while incarcerated; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b659-7\">\u201c(3) Any other evidence the court, within its discretion, determines to be relevant in deciding whether a new sentence would result in an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety.\u201d (\u00a7 1170.126, subd. (g).)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b659-8\">The meaning of \u201cunreasonable risk of danger to public safety\u201d is made clear by reference to the examples of evidence the trial court may consider in making this determination. To determine unreasonable risk, the trial court may consider any relevant evidence, including a defendant\u2019s criminal conviction history and record of discipline and rehabilitation while incarcerated. Far from giving \u201cinsufficient guidance\u201d on how to determine unreasonable risk as defendant claims, the statute enumerates factors the court may consider in exercising its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-9\">Defendant insists the term \u201cunreasonable risk of danger to public safety\u201d is vague because the term \u201cunreasonable\u201d is not defined with mathematical precision. He questions whether it \u201cmean[s] a risk of harm that is more likely than not to occur, say a risk greater than 50%? Or is an \u2018unreasonable risk\u2019 one which cannot be eliminated by the use of reasonable or rational analysis?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b659-10\">The critical inquiry, however, is not whether the risk is quantifiable, but rather, whether the risk would be \u201cunreasonable.\u201d (\u00a7 1170.126, subd. (f).) \u201c \u2018The law is replete with instances in which a person must, at his peril, govern his conduct by such nonmathematical standards as \u201creasonable,\u201d \u201cprudent,\u201d \u201cnecessary and proper,\u201d \u201csubstantial,\u201d and the like. Indeed, a wide spectrum of human activities is regulated by such terms: thus one man may be given a speeding ticket if he overestimates the \u201creasonable or prudent\u201d speed to drive his car in the circumstances (Veh. Code, \u00a7 22350), while another may be incarcerated in state prison on a conviction of wilful homicide if he misjudges the \u201creasonable\u201d amount of force he may use in repelling an assault [citation]. As the Supreme Court stated in <em>Go-Bart Importing Co. </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1931) 282 U.S. 344, 357 [75 L.Ed. 374, 51 S.Ct. 153], \u201cThere is no formula for the determination of reasonableness.\u201d Yet standards of this kind are not impermissively vague, provided their meaning can be objectively ascertained by reference to common experiences of mankind.\u2019 \u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Morgan </em>(2007) 42 Cal.4th 593, 606 [67 Cal.Rptr.3d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"770\">*770</page-number>753, 170 P.3d 129], quoting <em>People </em>v. <em>Daniels </em>(1969) 71 Cal.2d 1119, 1128-1129 [80 Cal.Rptr. 897, 459 P.2d 225].)</p>\n<p id=\"b660-5\">Here, as we have explained, the meaning of the term \u201cunreasonable risk of danger to public safety\u201d is clear because it can be objectively ascertained by reference to the examples of evidence the trial court may consider in making this determination. There is no merit in defendant\u2019s claim otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-6\">II<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b660-7\">DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b660-8\">The judgment (the court\u2019s order denying defendant\u2019s petition for resentencing) is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-9\">Raye, P.
