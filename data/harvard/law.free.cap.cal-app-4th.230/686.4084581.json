Yes.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b606-14\">This is the only part of this opinion certified for publication, so we set forth a brief pr\u00e9cis of the relevant facts for the benefit of those readers who will not have access to the balance of the opinion; In 2007, a developer named Inland engaged a general contractor called 361 to develop a Kohl\u2019s department store and surrounding property on a tract in Beaumont. The construction lender was Wachovia Bank. General contractor 361 contracted with, among others, Palomar Grading &amp; Paving, Inc. (Palomar Grading) and Cass to do infrastructural work benefitting the tract. As it turned out, both Kohl\u2019s and Wachovia ended up owning parcels in the tract. Neither, however, ever entered a contract with the two subcontractors. Palomar Grading and Cass were not paid for substantial portions of their work, and brought <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>successful actions to foreclose their mechanic\u2019s liens.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> The trial judge awarded them prejudgment interest at 10 percent,<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> and now Kohl\u2019s and Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., as Wachovia\u2019s successor, are challenging that decision. We write on a clean slate. No published case has considered the issue.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b607-4\">There is a default rate of interest prescribed by the Constitution in article XV, section 1, for the \u201cforbearance of any money, goods, or <em>things in action, </em>or on accounts after demand, shall be 7 percent per annum . . . .\u201d (Italics added.) Things in action obviously include the right to foreclose on a mechanic\u2019s lien. The Legislature, however, has enacted Civil Code, section 3289, subdivision (b), specifying that the default <em>for breach of contract </em>is 10 percent.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> The lien claimants in this case argue for the applicability of section 3289\u2019s 10 percent, as distinct from the constitutional default rate of 7 percent.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>We determine it is the constitutional default rate that should apply to prejudgment interest on a mechanic\u2019s lien as applied to noncontracting, innocent owners. Unlike section 3289, the prejudgment interest statute, section 3287 applies to both contract and tort actions. (See <em>Marine Terminals Corp. v. Paceco, Inc. </em>(1983) 145 Cal.App.3d 991, 995 [193 Cal.Rptr. 687].) Torts generally do not involve obligations incurred by contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-5\">The salient fact here is that the owners of the property had no contract with either Palomar Grading or Cass. The liens on the property are the result of the imposition of the mechanic\u2019s lien laws, not contract. The comments of an appellate panel from the depths of the Great Depression summarize the essence of the legal relationship: \u201cThe right of a materialman to have declared and enforced his lien against specific property is a right <em>provided to him by the organic law, </em>and shall not be lightly considered. It is true perhaps, that changing conditions have, in some cases, permitted <em>an apparent injustice to result through enforcement of liens against an innocent owner, or one defrauded through the machinations of a dishonest contractor.\u201d (Bay Lumber Co. v. Pickering </em>(1932) 120 Cal.App. 163, 167 [7 P.2d 371], italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b608-6\">We must not forget that, as explained by our Supreme Court in <em>Connolly Development, Inc. v. Superior Court </em>(1976) 17 Cal.3d 803, 811 [132 Cal.Rptr. 477, 553 P.2d 637], the operation of mechanic\u2019s liens <em>do </em>constitute a \u201ctaking\u201d of an owner\u2019s interest in its property: \u201cThe owner whose property has been subjected to a mechanic\u2019s lien has suffered at least as serious a deprivation as did the plaintiffs in [two United State Supreme Court cases], and thus cannot be denied the protection of the due process clause.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 812.) But the taking is <em>justified, </em>in terms of an owner who is innocent of breaching a contract with an unpaid lien claimant, precisely because the owner\u2019s property has been benefitted by the work or material of the lien claimant. \u201cThe purpose of a mechanics\u2019 lien is to prevent unjust enrichment of a property owner at the expense of laborers or material suppliers.\u201d <em>(Basic Modular Facilities, Inc. v. Ehsanipour </em>(1999) 70 Cal.App.4th 1480, 1483 [83 Cal.Rptr.2d 462].) But that benefit is not necessarily the result of an owner\u2019s <em>contract </em>with the lien claimant. Just as prejudgment interest can be given in tort cases, an owner who did not contract with a lien claimant can be legally exposed to prejudgment interest. It follows, then, that the statutory default rate for <em>contract </em>breaches of 10 percent should not be applicable to innocent, noncontracting owners, who are analogous to tort defendants, not contract defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-7\">The lien claimants here posit two theories against our conclusion. Palomar Grading\u2019s is direct. It simply is not \u201cfair,\u201d says Palomar Grading, to charge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>10 percent against the \u201cimprover of land\u201d\u2014by which it appears Palomar Grading means a general contractor who breaches a contract with a subcontractor\u2014and let an owner get away with only 7 percent. But it <em>is </em>fair, when one realizes the owner\u2019s loss is a matter of operation of law, not voluntary choice. Unfortunately, general contractors sometimes stiff their subcontractors after taking money from the owner or the owner\u2019s banker. In that situation the mechanic\u2019s lien law in effect forces innocent owners to pay twice. To be sure, their paying twice may be justified by the special solicitude shown toward unpaid contractors and material suppliers by the mechanic\u2019s lien law\u2014that law is, after all, part of the California Constitution (art. XIV, \u00a7 3)\u2014but the justification for the loss of property in the case of innocent owners is certainly not that they <em>agreed </em>to it. Thus it is perfectly \u201cfair\u201d that the defaulting contractor that breached its contract should have to pay a higher rate than an innocent owner who did not.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-4\">Cass makes a different argument. It focuses on its right to recover the amount due according to its contract. For Cass, because it is \u201centitled to recover the amount due pursuant to its contract\u201d it should receive 10 percent interest, period. But that logic ignores former section 3123. The statutory language was: \u201cThe liens provided for in this chapter shall be direct liens, and shall be <em>for the reasonable value </em>of the labor, services, equipment, or materials furnished <em>or </em>for the <em>price agreed upon by the claimant and the person with whom he or she contracted, </em>whichever is <em>less.\u201d (Id., </em>subd. (a), italics added.) Thus a lien claimant does not <em>necessarily </em>receive the amount due on its contract. Again, we see that insofar as the mechanic\u2019s lien laws act on an innocent owner, the obligation is <em>noncontractual\u2014limited by statute </em>to the reasonable value of work when it is less than the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-5\">Cass\u2019s brief also cites some language from a comment apparently in the 4th edition of the respected Marsh treatise on mechanic\u2019s lien law, to the effect \u201cit is safe to say only that the lien claimant\u2019s right to interest is limited to the legal rate (now 10%).\u201d There are two answers to the proffered quotation: One, the quotation only refers to a <em>limit, </em>not what is actually appropriate, and does not\u2014at least in the snippet Cass gives us\u2014address prejudgment interest as such. And two, while the \u201csafe to say\u201d language might have been found in the 4th edition of Marsh, it is not to be found in section 4.75 of either the hard copy of the current 6th edition or the current online version. (See 1 Marsh, Cal. Mechanics' Lien Law (6th ed. 2011) \u00a7 4.75, pp. 4-129 to 4-132.) Moreover, that particular section of Marsh is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>written as a practice guide from the point of view of an attorney for a lien claimant, and the thrust of the section is <em>not </em>\u201cthis is the law,\u201d but \u201cthere\u2019s no harm in trying.\u201d<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b610-5\">Obviously our brief decision in regard to the prejudgment interest issue does not address the question of prejudgment interest in the case of culpable, contract-breaching owners, that is, owners who breach their contracts with contractors or materials suppliers and for <em>that </em>reason have a mechanic\u2019s lien slapped on their property. We also do not address the possibility (far-fetched to be sure) of a sham change in ownership (from say, a breaching owner to an ostensibly nonbreaching one) done deliberately to try to gain a better interest rate. Our decision today only applies to \u201cinnocent\u201d owners who, even though they did not breach their own contracts, nonetheless wound up with property subject to a mechanic\u2019s lien.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-6\">Because this part is self-contained in the context of this partially published opinion, we state our disposition as to the prejudgment interest issue now: The judgment is reversed insofar as it provides for a rate of prejudgment interest at 10 percent and is remanded for a recalculation at the rate of 7 percent. The topic of appellate costs is covered in the unpublished disposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-7\">IV. DISPOSITION<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b610-8\">Rylaarsdam, Acting P. J., and Aronson, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b606-15\">See footnote, <em>ante, </em>page 686.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b607-5\"> The unpublished balance of this opinion is largely taken up explaining why Cass\u2019s and R3\u2019s judgments of lien foreclosure are being affirmed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"25\">\n<p id=\"b607-6\"> We have determined that the decision to award Palomar Grading and Cass prejudgment interest in the first place was a correct one because the precise amounts owed were ascertainable from the initial recording of their liens. (Cf. <em>Forsgren Associates, Inc. v. Pacific Golf Community Development LLC </em>(2010) 182 Cal.App.4th 135, 159-160 [105 Cal.Rptr.3d 654] [prejudgment interest not appropriate where precise amount of liens on respective properties had not been ascertained by trial court].)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"26\">\n<p id=\"b607-7\"> In their briefing, the parties dispute the precedential value of the published portion of <em>Royster Construction Co. v. Urban West Communities </em>(1995) 40 Cal.App.4th 1158 [47 Cal.Rptr.2d 684]. Answer: It has no precedential value on the interest rate point, even by inference. In <em>Royster, </em>a mechanic\u2019s lien claimant was awarded prejudgment interest at 10 percent <em>(id. </em>at p. 1164), and the appellate court squarely ruled that the judgment had to be modified to reduce the prejudgment interest to 7 percent <em>(id. </em>at p. 1171). But why? We do not know. The panel certified <em>Royster </em>for publication, excepting its part 3 involving prejudgment interest. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1158, fn. *.) Strictly speaking, then, while we know what the court <em>did, </em>we do not know <em>why </em>the court did it. The California Constitution says that \u201cDecisions of the Supreme Court and courts of appeal that determine causes shall be in writing with reasons stated,\u201d but in the case of <em>Royster\u2019s </em>determination that the trial court erred in awarding 10 percent, as distinct from 7 percent prejudgment interest, there were, for our purposes here, no reasons stated. (Cal. Const., art. VI, \u00a7 14.) <em>Royster\u2019s </em>determination, ensconced in the nonpublished part of the opinion, is the functional equivalent of the summary denial of a petition for writ by the Court of Appeal; it did not determine any cause, and thus has no precedential vale. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Kelly </em>(2006) 40 Cal.4th 106, 116, fn. 1 [51 Cal.Rptr.3d 98, 146 P.3d 547].)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"27\">\n<p id=\"b607-8\"> All statutory references are to the Civil Code. And, as explained in the unpublished portion of this opinion, California\u2019s mechanic\u2019s lien law used to occupy sections 3082 through 3267. Now it occupies sections 8000 through 9566. The switch-over date was July 1, 2012. The Legislature specifically provided that the old law would govern for mechanic\u2019s liens recorded before that date. (See \u00a7 8052.) Section 3289, however, as it currently stands, was unaffected by the 2012 mechanic\u2019s lien statutory switch-overs. The statute provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-9\">\u201c(a) Any legal rate of interest stipulated by a contract remains chargeable after a breach thereof, as before, until the contract is superseded by a verdict or other new obligation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-8\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>\u201c(b) If a contract entered into after January 1, 1986, does not stipulate a legal rate of interest, the obligation shall bear interest at a rate of 10 percent per annum after a breach.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-9\">\u201cFor the purposes of this subdivision, the term contract shall not include a note secured by a deed of trust on real property.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"28\">\n<p id=\"b610-9\"> We will quote the current (2014) comment in its entirety here: \u201cUnder current statutes and decisions, it appears <em>that there is no prohibition against claiming interest </em>(and/or damages) <em>according to agreement, or at 10 percent from date of breach, </em>but it should be recognized that the lien or stop notice as such creates no special remedy in this regard. <em>On the other hand, </em>the lien on the owner\u2019s property is limited by Civil Code section 8430(a) to agreed price or reasonable value, whichever is less\u2014so that is a matter for the judge or jury in any particular trial court and case.\u201d (1 Marsh, Cal. Mechanic's Lien Law (accessible on Lexis Advance, database updated 2014).)</p>\n<p id=\"b610-10\">This is not exactly a ringing endorsement of the idea that the law <em>requires </em>10 percent prejudgment interest against innocent owners.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b610-11\">See footnote, <em>ante, </em>page 686.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
