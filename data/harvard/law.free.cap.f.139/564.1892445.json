It comes here on appeal from a decree finding \u201cthat the machines owned and used by the defendants, as shown in the proofs and exhibits, do not infringe any of the patents set out in the bill of complaint.\u201d' There is no opinion of record.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-17\">Crayons when molded, tend to adhere to the mold plates. Early .in the art \u2014 indeed, up to the time of the making of the inventions embodied in the above claims \u2014 they were loosened and discharged by hand. These inventions had for their object the loosening and discharging of the crayons by mechanical means: First, through a movement in and by a machine having a rocking or tilting device, of the mold plates relative to one another in line with the length of the mold, so as in turn to strip the crayon from each mold plate (patent No. 476,051) ; and, second, through a movement, in and by a machine, of the mold plates upwardly and downwardly, alternately being lifted and dropped, so as not only to strip but jar the crayons loose (patent No. 476,038).</p>\n<p id=\"b597-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>1. Patent No. 476,051, as stated in the specification, had for its object \u201can improved form of mold plates and mold plate frames, the mold plates being pivoted or axially journaled that they may be partially rotated and the crayons loosened or forced from the mold plates.\u201d In the description of the mode of operation of the machine it is pointed out that the tilting or partial rotation of the pivoted mold plates results in a movement of the mold plates relative to one another in line with the length of the mold, which causes the crayon to be \u201cloosened or freed forcibly\u201d first from one mold plate and then from the other. \u201cAs the force exerted,\u201d says the specification, \u201cis applied in the direction of the crayons\u2019 length, there.is no possibility of the crayons being broken.\u201d Patent No. 476,051 contains 22 claims, but the following is the only one involved :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-4\">Claim 2: \u201cIn a machine for the manufacture of crayons, carpenters\u2019 chalk, or other like articles, the combination of two sectional mold plates together forming a complete mold, said mold being open at one end, said mold plates adjustable relative to each other in line with the length of the mold, substantially as set forth.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b597-5\">It is urged in opposition that this is either a claim for the movement of the mold plates relative to one another, or for the mechanism which produces the movement. If for the former, the claim is void, because it is merely for a function, mode of operation, or result, which cannot be patented. If for the latter, there is no infringement, because the mechanism employed by the appellees differs essentially from that described in the patent, to which, or its equivalent, the words \u201csubstantially as set forth\u201d limits the invention.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-6\">It is also insisted that if a patent could be taken out for the relative movement of the mold plates, an examination of the prior art will disclose that such relative movement was old, and therefore not patentable. In support of this charge of anticipation the patents of Magers, November 13, 1840; Driver, January 13, 1863; Bill, October 22, 1878; Knight, September 14, 1858; Fuchs, May 22, 1888; and others \u2014 are cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-7\">Taking up the last point first, while the machines covered by these patents, some for molding bullets, some for making crayons, disclose mold plates fitted in a frame, and movable in some way by mechanism for the purpose of discharging the crayon or bullet, not one shows a movement of the mold plates relative to one another in line with the length of the mold; in other words, the movement which the appellees\u2019 machine was invented to secure. It may be conceded that mold plates must be moved relative to one another in order to discharge the molded articles. This has been true from the beginning of the art. And long before this invention there were machines in and by which the mold plates were moved in order to discharge the molded article. But this invention was to secure a particular kind of movement of the mold plates, one in the line of the length of the mold, so that the crayon held in one of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>mold plates would, by this movement, be stripped from the other, and then, held in the second, be stripped from the first. None of the patents referred to suggest any such movement, and yet this is the only movement which secures tfie desired result. The conception of a machine to secure this movement solved the serious problem in the art of crayon making.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-4\">Coming now to the more difficult question, we think it must be conceded that the movement of a machine irrespective of the mechanism which causes it cannot be patented. Burr v. Duryee, 1 Wall. 531, 568, et seq, 17 L. Ed. 650, 660, 661; Case v. Brown, 2 Wall. 320, 328, 17 L. Ed. 817; Merrill v. Yeomans, 94 U. S. 568, 573, 24 L. Ed. 235; Wessell v. United Mattress Machinery Co. (opinion of this court just handed down) 139 Fed. 11. The claim must be restricted to the mechanism which causes the movement, subject, of course, to the rule of equivalents, which operates liberally in favor of the grantee where the patent is primary in nature, making a distinct advance in the progress of the art; and this patent, in our opinion, is of that character. When we examine the mechanism, we find in the appellant\u2019s machine described in the patent a rocking or tilting device, and in the appellees\u2019 a lifting and dropping device. The appliances are essentially different. They do different things in distinct ways. The one rocks or tilts the mold plates, the other alternately lifts and drops them. It is true the tilting motion causes the mold plates to move relative to one another in line with the length of the mold, which is just what the lifting and dropping motion does; but are we justified in holding that these two essentially distinct devices are equivalents, simply because the ultimate result, namely, the movement of the mold plates relative to one another in line with the length of the mold, is the same? We think not, for that would be construing the claim so as to cover the movement alone and not the mechanism producing it. It would be virtually giving a patent for the result, regardless of how reached.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-5\">2.' Claims 1, 6, and 9 of patent No. 476,038 read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-6\">Claim 3: \u201cIn- a machine for making crayons, carpenters\u2019 chalk, or other like articles, the combination of an upwardly and downwardly movable mold plate having downwardly discharging mold formation with an actuating cam, said cam engaging with said mold plate and thus raising it and then disengaging itself therefrom, substantially as set forth.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-7\">Claim 6: \u201cIn a machine for the manufacture of crayons, carpenters\u2019 chalk, or other like articles, the combination, with a number of cams, the projecting portion of one cam alternating with the depressed portion of the next cam, of a number of mold plates respectively having engagements with said cams, substantially as set forth.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-8\">Claim 9: \u201cIn a machine for the manufacture of crayons, carpenters\u2019 chalk, or other like articles, the combination of a mold plate frame provided on its opposite sides with shoulders, a series of mold plates having their opposite extremities engaging with said shoulders, and two rows of rotary cams respectively engaging with opposite extremeties of said mold plates, the projecting portions of alternate cams of each row being located spirally on a pitch with respect to each other, the projecting portions of companion cams of the two rows being located substantially in the same horizontal plane, substantially as set forth.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b599-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>These are for the mechanism which alternately lifts and drops the mold plates, and, after stripping the crayons'free, jars them out. Of course, the use of a sudden shock or jar to loosen a molded article is old. In the record it appears that the appellant at one time used a machine called the \u201cWaltham machine,\u201d in which the mold plates were drawn out by hand, and, being held over a tray, struck with a mallet in order to jar the crayons loose. But the machine covered by this patent, which automatically jars the mold members so as to loosen and discharge the crayons, was both novel and patentable. For the purpose mentioned the appellant used a rotary cam, which alternately lifted and dropped the mold plates. In the specification it was stated that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-4\">\u201cThe leading features of this invention comprise mechanism which operates the mold plates in an upward and downward movement, said mold plates having downwardly discharging mold formation, the arrest of such downward movement adapted to cause the loosening or discharge of the crayons and spring mechanism which causes the said mold plates to descend in their said downward movement with speed and force over their gravity tendency, so as to insure certainty in the loosening or discharge of the crayons.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b599-5\">The defendant\u2019s machine, as first used, described in patent No. 658,680, granted September 25, 1900, on an application filed March 15, 1900, also used a-rotary cam to lift and drop the mold members, but the mold members were arranged in an annular, instead of a rectanguler, frame. Later (whether for the purpose of avoiding a charge of infringement or to improve the machine it is unnecessary to discuss) a rock shaft with a hook was substituted for the rotary cam. In our opinion, the appellees could not avoid the effect of the appellant\u2019s patents by arranging the molds in rings instead of rectangles. They used sectional molds just as the appellant, their machine, employing the same actuating cam, moved the mold members relative to one another in the line of the length of the mold, stripping the crayon from the mold members, and by the same sort of a jar, secured by lifting and dropping the mold members, shook the crayons loose. Thus by an immaterial change the appellees sought to secure all the benefit of the appellant\u2019s inventions. This could not be done. Even if the arrangement of the molds in rings instead of rectangles was an improvement, the appellees could not obtain the benefit of it without first obtaining the right to use the original inventions. Morley v. Lancaster, 129 U. S. 263, 278, 9 Sup. Ct. 299, 32 L. Ed. 715. Subsequently, instead of using the rotating cam, a rock shaft with a hook was substituted for the purpose of lifting and dropping the mold members and thus jarring the crayons loose. We are satisfied from a careful examination of the lifting mechanism of these two machines that the rock shaft with a hook is no more than a mechanical equivalent for the rotating cam. In one case the rotating cam, engaging with the mold member, lifts it; in the other, the hook attached to the rock shaft, which operates as a cam, engages with the mold member. The similarity of these devices, their essential equivalency, is illustrated in the following cuts. The first may be taken as representing the cam device, the second, the hook device:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>\n<img
