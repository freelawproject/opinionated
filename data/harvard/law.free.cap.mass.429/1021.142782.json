Senior.</parties>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"AyR\">June 22, 1999.</decisiondate>\n<court data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"court\" id=\"AlL\">\n<em>Supreme Judicial Court,</em>\n</court>\n<p data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"court\" id=\"ALZ\">Superintendence of inferior courts.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b929-11\">After he was convicted of motor vehicle homicide, the defendant moved for a stay of execution of his sentence, which the trial judge denied. The defendant renewed his motion for a stay before a single justice of the Appeals Court, who granted his application and stayed further execution of the sentence. The single justice conditioned the defendant\u2019s release on his posting bail; surrendering his driver\u2019s license; refraining from operating or attempting to operate a motor vehicle; and diligently prosecuting his appeal. The defendant complied with the single justice\u2019s order and was released on bail. The Commonwealth filed in the county court a petition pursuant to G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 3, through which it sought an order vacating the order of the Appeals Court single justice. A single justice of this court denied the petition, and the Commonwealth appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-12\">\u201cIt is well settled that this court will not reverse an order of a single justice in the absence of an abuse of discretion or clear error of law.\u201d <em>Greco </em>v. <em>Suffolk Div. of the Probate &amp; Family Court Dep\u2019t, </em>418 Mass. 153, 156 (1994), and cases cited. See <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Boston Elev. Ry., 235 </em>Mass. 482, 496-497, 502 (1920) (discussing \u201cabuse of judicial discretion\u201d standard). It is only in the context of reviewing the denial by a single justice of this court of the Commonwealth\u2019s G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 3, petition that we consider whether the Appeals Court single justice abused her discretion in staying further execution of the defendant\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-13\">Execution of a sentence may be stayed in cases in which the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1022\">*1022</page-number>raises \u201can issue which is worthy of presentation to an appellate court, one which offers some reasonable possibility of a successful decision in the appeal.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Allen, </em>378 Mass. 489, 498 (1979), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Levin, 7 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 501, 504 (1979). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hodge (No. 1), </em>380 Mass. 851, 855 (1980). A judge must find that the defendant presents no risk of flight or danger to the community, and that he is unlikely to commit additional criminal acts during the pendency of his appeal. <em>Id. Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Allen, supra </em>at 498.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b930-8\"><em>Frank J. Middleton, </em>Assistant District Attorney, for the Commonwealth.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"Apk\"><em>Kevin J. Reddington, </em>for the defendant, submitted a brief.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b930-5\">The Appeals Court single justice concluded that \u201cthe defendant has presented a meritorious appellate issue concerning the Commonwealth\u2019s acquisition and use of information as to blood testing done for the purpose of preparing a defense and not for medical purposes.\u201d We agree. Moreover, the defendant raises a novel issue concerning the admissibility of retrograde extrapolation evidence which the Appeals Court has discussed (in a different context) in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>35 Mass. App. Ct. 655, 662-664 (1993), but which we have not decided. In concluding that the defendant did not pose a risk of flight or danger to the community, the Appeals Court single justice properly emphasized the defendant\u2019s ties to the community, his lack of a criminal record, and his attendance, while on bail, at all previous court proceedings. Additionally, the conditions she imposed in granting the stay provide some further assurance that the defendant will not endanger the community or commit additional criminal acts.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-6\">The single justice of this court could reasonably have concluded that the Appeals Court single justice neither abused her discretion nor committed an error of law in staying further execution of the defendant\u2019s sentence. Accordingly, we conclude that the single justice properly denied the Commonwealth\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
