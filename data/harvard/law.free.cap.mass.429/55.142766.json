L. c. 197, \u00a7 9 <em>{a), </em>or by G. L. c. 197, \u00a7 13, which provides a limitation period that expires when the decedent\u2019s estate has been fully administered. We conclude that the plaintiff\u2019s claim for alimony due during the year following the decedent\u2019s death is time-barred by G. L. c. 197, \u00a7 9 (a), but that G. L. c. 197, \u00a7 13, does not preclude the plaintiff from asserting her claim for alimony payments due <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>after the one-year limitation period of G. L. c. 197, \u00a7 9 <em>(a), </em>has expired.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-5\">1. <em>Facts. </em>The material facts are undisputed. Joan L. Flannery (plaintiff) and John J. Flannery (decedent) were divorced in 1971. The plaintiff was awarded support in the amount of $135 a week pursuant to an agreement between the parties that was incorporated into the divorce judgment. The agreement provided that the decedent\u2019s support obligation would terminate on the plaintiff\u2019s death or remarriage. The agreement was made \u201cbinding upon the parties . . . and their respective heirs, executors, administrators, successors and assigns.\u201d In May, 1987, the plaintiff and the decedent entered into a stipulation to modify the agreement (modification agreement), which provided, in part, that beginning June 1, 1987, the decedent would pay the plaintiff $250 weekly for a ten-year period. Payments would terminate on the plaintiff\u2019s death or remarriage. The weekly instalments were regularly paid to the plaintiff until the decedent\u2019s death on December 23, 1987. No weekly payments have been made since that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-6\">In January, 1993, the plaintiff filed a petition in the Probate and Family Court pursuant to G. L. c. 197, \u00a7 13. On December 9, 1993, the court found that the plaintiff held a claim in the amount of $122,750. Pursuant to G. L. c. 197, \u00a7 13, the court ordered the legal representative of the decedent\u2019s estate (defendant) to reserve sufficient assets in the estate to satisfy the plaintiff\u2019s claim. To date, the decedent\u2019s estate has not been settled.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-7\">On December 29, 1993, the plaintiff filed the present action in the Superior Court seeking 312 weeks of alimony payments and an order of specific performance for the remaining four years. Both parties moved for summary judgment. Resolution of the summary judgment motions is pending because the parties filed a statement of agreed material facts and a joint request that the Superior Court report three questions to the Appeals Court.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Thereafter, the case was reported to the Appeals Court, pursuant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>to Mass. R. Civ. R 64 (a), as amended, 423 Mass. 1403 (1996), and we transferred the case to this court on our own motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-5\">2. <em>Discussion. </em>The primary issue is whether the one-year statute of limitations of G. L. c. 197, \u00a7 9 (a), bars the plaintiff\u2019s claim under G. L. c. 197, \u00a7 13. We conclude that G. L. c. 197, \u00a7 13, does not bar the plaintiff\u2019s claims arising after the one-year limitation period found in \u00a7 9. Discussion of the other questions reported is unnecessary because our holding resolves the dispositive issue for the Superior Court. The plaintiff has raised an additional issue whether the Probate Court\u2019s allowance of her petition under G. L. c. 197, \u00a7 13, has res judicata effect. This argument is not persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-6\">a. <em>General Laws c. 197, \u00a7\u00a7 9 (a) and 13. </em>Two statutes of limitations are at issue here. General Laws c. 197, \u00a7 9 (a), provides, in pertinent part, that \u201can executor or administrator shall not be held to answer to an action by a creditor of the deceased\u201d that is not \u201ccommenced within one year after the date of death of the deceased.\u201d The one-year statute of limitations expedites the settlement of estates, and protects the interests of both the creditors and administrators. See <em>Department of Pub. Welfare </em>v. <em>Anderson, </em>377 Mass. 23, 28 (1979). General Laws c. 197, \u00a7 13, prescribes the method by which a creditor of the deceased, whose right of action shall not accrue within one year after the date of the decedent\u2019s death, may preserve a claim against the decedent\u2019s estate. Relief by way of an order for the retention of assets can be had by a \u201ccreditor of the deceased, whose right of action shall not accrue within one year after the date of death of the deceased\u201d if such creditor presents \u201chis claim to the probate court at any time before the estate is fully administered\u201d and if \u201cthe court shall find that such claim is or may become justly due from the estate.\u201d G. L. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>c. 197, \u00a7 13. See <em>First Nat\u2019l Bank </em>v. Nichols, 294 Mass. 173, 175 (1936).</p>\n<p id=\"b78-5\">b. <em>Divisible contracts. </em>We conclude that the plaintiffs contract with the decedent is divisible. Thus, \u00a7 9 <em>(a) </em>bars only the portion of the claim that accrued during the first year after the decedent\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-6\">A divisible contract contemplates performance divided into differing parts, with separate consideration provided for each. See <em>Bianchi Bros. </em>v. <em>Gendron, </em>292 Mass. 438, 444 (1935). When the statute of limitations for a breach of contract begins to run depends on whether the contract is entire or divisible. See 18 S. Williston, Contracts \u00a7 2021A, at 697 (3d ed. 1978). Where an obligation is payable in instalments, the general rule is that the applicable statute of limitations begins to run against the recovery of each instalment from the time it becomes due. See <em>McDade </em>v. <em>Moynihan, </em>330 Mass. 437, 439 (1953) (each breach of contract gives rise to a separate cause of action). In the present case, even though one contract provided all the terms between the parties, the agreement was divisible because it provided for payments in instalments. Thus, the statute of limitations did not begin to run for unmatured claims, i.e., the payment of instalments due when the defendant\u2019s estate was obliged to make each weekly payment. See <em>Westminster Nat\u2019l Bank </em>v. <em>Graustein, </em>270 Mass. 565, 587 (1930), and cases cited.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b78-7\">c. <em>Accrual of the plaintiff\u2019s claims. </em>We conclude the plaintiffs right of action on the weekly payments due in the first year after the decedent\u2019s death accrued within one year after his death. Thus, the plaintiffs claims for the past due alimony attributable to the one-year period following the decedent\u2019s death fail by operation of G. L. c. 197, \u00a7\u00a7 9 and 13. Nothing in either of those provisions, however, precludes her claims for amounts due as alimony payments after that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-8\">The general rule in breach of contract cases is that a cause of action accrues when the contract is breached. See <em>Campanella &amp; Cardi Constr. Co. </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>351 Mass. 184, 185 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>(1966). Thus, not all the plaintiff\u2019s claims are barred by \u00a7 9 (a), because her cause of action did not entirely accrue within the year following the decedent\u2019s death. In the present case, when the defendant\u2019s estate failed to make a weekly payment, a separate cause of action accrued for each payment. Thus, the plaintiff\u2019s right of action for only some payments accrued within the year following the decedent\u2019s death. The defendant\u2019s default, therefore, does not render the plaintiff\u2019s entire claim barred by the one-year time limitation of \u00a7 9 (a). The claim also is covered under G. L. c. 197, \u00a7 13, which allows the plaintiff to present her claim to the Probate Court for payments due at any time after the first year, but before the estate is finally administered.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-5\">d. <em>Res judicata. </em>The plaintiff argues that the probate decree is binding and conclusive, and, thus, res judicata bars the defendant\u2019s claim. We do not find this argument persuasive. General Laws c. 197, \u00a7 14, explicitly states that the Probate Court\u2019s decision is not conclusive unless proved through an action.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b79-6\">3. <em>Conclusion. </em>Because G. L. c. 197, \u00a7 9 <em>(a), </em>bars the plaintiff\u2019s claim one year from the date of the decedent\u2019s death, the plaintiff may not recover alimony payments which accrued within the year after the decedent\u2019s death. Under G. L. c. 197, \u00a7 13, however, the plaintiff may maintain an action for alimony payments arising more than one year after the decedent\u2019s death but prior to the final administration of the decedent\u2019s estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b76-8\">The reported questions read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b76-9\">\u201c1.

Whether Mass. Gen. Laws c. 197, \u00a7 9 (a), bars an action on a contract in favor of a decedent\u2019s former wife for weekly alimony obligations that survive the death of the decedent, but that do not fall due under the contract term until <em>more than one year </em>following the date of death of the decedent, when such action is filed and served more than one year after the date of the decedent\u2019s death.\u201d (Emphasis in original.)</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b78-9\">In other jurisdictions, where a divorce decree provides for the payment of alimony in instalments, the right to enforce payment accrues and the statute of limitations begins to run on each instalment from the time fixed for its payment.
