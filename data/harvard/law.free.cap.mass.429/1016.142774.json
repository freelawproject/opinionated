Robinson (petitioner) appeals from the denial of his petition, pursu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1017\">*1017</page-number>ant to G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 3, for relief by a single justice of this court. The petitioner, while awaiting a new trial, sought review of several pretrial motions he had filed pro se and that he claimed had neither been docketed by the clerk nor acted on by the court. The single justice denied the request for relief; judgment was entered on September 28, 1998; the petitioner filed a notice of appeal on October 2, 1998.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b925-8\"><em>Jane Davidson Montori, </em>Assistant District Attorney, for the Commonwealth.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"A43U\"><em>Ray W. Robinson, </em>pro se.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b925-5\">The Commonwealth has filed a motion to dismiss the petitioner\u2019s appeal, alleging, among other things, that the court has not acted on some of the petitioner\u2019s motions or has reserved action for the trial judge and asserting that review of the trial judge\u2019s decisions may be obtained on appeal from the final judgment. The petitioner then filed an opposition to the motion to dismiss. The conclusory allegations therein regarding the absence of any other remedy are not persuasive. The petitioner\u2019s subsequent motion to dismiss his appeal without prejudice does not alter our view. The Commonwealth\u2019s motion to dismiss is allowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b925-7\">The case was submitted.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
