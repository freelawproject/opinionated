L. c. 93A, \u00a7 2 (c), to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"872\">*872</page-number>promulgate 940 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7\u00a7 16.00 et seq. (1997), in particular, \u00a7\u00a7 16.03, 16.04, 16.05, 16.06(3), and 16.07, which define deceptive or unfair acts or practices in the transfer, or offer to transfer, of certain types of handguns to a consumer in the Commonwealth. The regulations, which were promulgated in October, 1997, essentially prohibit the commercial sale or transfer of handguns that fail to satisfy prescribed safety and performance requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-5\">The plaintiffs filed a complaint in the Superior Court seeking declaratory and injunctive relief to prevent the Attorney General from enforcing the regulations. They alleged that, by promulgating the regulations, the Attorney General exceeded his authority under G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 2 (c), and that the regulations are arbitrary and capricious in violation of G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 7. The plaintiffs further alleged that the regulations violated their rights under various provisions of the United States Constitution and 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b892-6\">A few days before certain provisions of the handgun sales regulations were scheduled to take effect, the plaintiffs filed an application for a preliminary injunction, seeking to enjoin the Attorney General from enforcing the provisions on the ground that they are ultra vires.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The provisions define as an unfair or deceptive practice the sale of a handgun (a) without a tamper-resistant serial number (\u00a7 16.03)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>; (b) made from inferior <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"873\">*873</page-number>materials (\u00a7 16.04)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>; (c) without childproofing or safety devices (\u00a7 16.05)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>; and (d) with a barrel shorter than three inches, un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"874\">*874</page-number>less certain disclosures are made to the customer (\u00a7 16.06[3]).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> A judge in the Superior Court allowed the plaintiffs\u2019 application, in substantial part, after concluding that the plaintiffs \u201cestablished a strong likelihood that they will succeed in establishing that the challenged Regulations are invalid on the grounds that they are ultra vires,\u201d and that \u201cfailure to grant the [prehminary] injunction will irreparably harm [them].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b894-5\">The Attorney General appealed, pursuant to G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 118, second par., from the order entered on the preliminary injunction. We granted his application for direct appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-6\">1. In reaching her conclusion that the Attorney General lacked statutory authority to promulgate the regulations, the judge determined that, while \u201cthe harm which [G. L. c.] 93A seeks to prevent is primarily economic harm arising out of disparity in bargaining power between a merchant and a customer[,] [the regulations] seek to address the threat to the public safety posed by defective and otherwise unsafe handguns.\u201d The judge farther determined that \u201cthe power granted to the Attorney General by [G. L. c. 93A,] \u00a7 2 (c), does not encompass the power to establish design and performance standards for products sold in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"875\">*875</page-number>Massachusetts.\u201d She concluded that the \u201ccore of conduct encompassed within the phrase \u2018business acts and practices\u2019 is the manner and means used by merchants to market products and services to consumers.\u201d The Attorney General asserts that the judge erred by narrowly confining his regulatory authority to product marketing issues, and in concluding that G. L. c. 93A is aimed primarily at economic injury. The question concerns the scope of the Attorney General\u2019s authority in this area, and it is a question of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-5\">We shall first take up the nature of the Attorney General\u2019s authority. We conclude that he has the authority to regulate with respect to the type of handguns involved on two bases: (a) his authority pursuant to G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 2 (c), to prevent the deceptive or unfair sale or transfer of defective products which do not perform as warranted, and (b) his authority to apply G. L. c. 93A to acts and practices which the Legislature has defined as unlawful. As a consequence, we also conclude that the premise on which the preliminary injunction was issued is wrong; that some of the regulations can be implemented immediately; and that, as to the remaining regulations in dispute, there must be further proceedings in the Superior Court to determine their validity and to decide the other, claims in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-6\">(a) Section 2 <em>(a) </em>of G. L. c. 93A \u201cstates the substantive core of the act: \u2018Unfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices in the conduct of any trade or commerce are hereby declared unlawful.\u2019 \u201d <em>Purity Supreme, Inc. </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen., </em>380 Mass. 762, 766 (1980). Subsection <em>(b) </em>instructs the courts to define \u201cunfair or deceptive acts\u201d with reference to \u201cthe interpretations given by the Federal Trade Commission [FTC] and the Federal Courts to section 5(a)(1) of the Federal Trade Commission Act (15 U.S.C. [\u00a7] 45[a][1]) [FTC Act], as from time to time amended.\u201d It is within this context that subsection (c) permits the Attorney General to \u201cmake rules and regulations interpreting the provisions of subsection 2 (a),\u201d so long as they are not \u201cinconsistent with the rules, regulations and decisions of the [FTC] and the Federal Courts interpreting the provisions of [the FTC Act], as from time to time amended.\u201d Thus, \u00a7 2 generally limits the Attorney General\u2019s rule-making power to be within the concepts of deception or unfairness, as guided by administrative and judicial interpretation of the FTC Act. <em>Purity Supreme, supra </em>at 776.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-7\">In addition to the above, the Attorney General\u2019s power is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"876\">*876</page-number>limited in certain other respects. He cannot regulate under G. L. c. 93A in areas where the regulation is expressly or implicitly proscribed by law or by judicial decision. See G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 3. See also <em>Reiter Oldsmobile, Inc. </em>v. <em>General Motors Corp., </em>378 Mass. 707, 711-712 (1979); <em>DePasquale </em>v. <em>Ogden Suffolk Downs, Inc., </em>29 Mass. App. Ct. 658, 662 (1990). He also generally cannot regulate in a way which conflicts with legislation. Cf. <em>Lowell Gas Co. </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen., </em>377 Mass. 37, 42-43 (1979); <em>Dodd </em>v. <em>Commercial Union Ins. Co., </em>373 Mass. 72, 76-78 (1977).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Further, Federal law generally preempts State regulation of many consumer products (but not firearms), as defined by statute. See the Consumer Product Safety Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2075(a), 2052 (1994).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> There are other limitations on the Attorney General\u2019s authority that we need not set forth here as they do not concern the issue before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-5\">With respect to the regulation of product safety and performance, the following considerations have pertinence to the Attorney General\u2019s authority. The Attorney General may not use his regulatory authority to pursue general policy goals or public issues that limit or ban the sale of lawful products under the general rubric that purchasers of the products, or third parties who may come into contact with them, would be better off if the products were not marketed at all. Questions concerning whether such products should be sold, or their sales restricted, are primarily legislative in character, and, if regulation by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"877\">*877</page-number>government agencies is to occur, it is ordinarily to be done pursuant to a delegation of authority by the Legislature. The Attorney General may, however, regulate in an area not otherwise withheld from his consideration, even if the regulation may affect the ability of the vendor to sell its product, if he can establish that the regulations define acts or practices which violate G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 2 (a). See <em>Purity Supreme, supra </em>at 775.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-5\">In this context, the Attorney General may regulate deceptive or unfair acts or practices in the sale of products which fail fundamental requirements of safety and performance. Here, we are in an area where the purchaser is sold a product which the purchaser reasonably believes is safe, if used as directed, and will perform in the manner expected of like products. If, during ordinary use in keeping with directions, the product performs in a deviantly unsafe or unexpected way, the product\u2019s sale has occurred in circumstances which make the sale deceptive or unfair. This is especially so where harmful or unexpected risks or dangers inherent in the product, or latent performance inadequacies, cannot be detected by the average user or cannot be avoided by adequate disclosures or warnings. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Johnson Insulation, </em>425 Mass. 650, 660-661 (1997) (\u201cAn article is not unreasonably dangerous merely because some risk of harm is associated with its use, but only where it is dangerous \u2018to an extent beyond that which would be contemplated by the ordinary consumer who purchases it, with the ordinary knowledge common to the community as to its characteristics.\u2019 Restatement [Second] of Torts ... \u00a7 402A comment i, at 352 [1965]\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b897-6\">An example may be helpful at this point. A power lawnmower possesses certain dangers, many of which are apparent, and all of which can be guarded against by proper disclosures and warnings. If used as expected the power lawnmower will safely and adequately cut grass. However, a power lawnmower which blows up, or catches fire when used in a normal manner, or which cannot adequately cut grass does not perform in an expected way. A consumer could validly claim that, in acquiring such a lawnmower, he has been dealt with unfairly and deceptively. The Attorney General possesses authority under G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 2 (c), in the interests of consumer protection, to regulate the sale of products that are unsafe or defective in ways that a purchaser cannot foresee. Such products fail to conform to standards of merchantability, and, where applicable, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"878\">*878</page-number>to standards governing fitness for a particular use. See G. L. c. 106, \u00a7\u00a7 2-314<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and 2-315.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> This authority is based on the settled rules that the sale of products posing unforeseeable dangers constitutes conduct recognized as falling within the prohibitions of G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 2 (a), see, e.g., <em>Calimlim </em>v. <em>Foreign Car Ctr., Inc., </em>392 Mass. 228, 236 (1984) (knowing sale of defective automobile); <em>Burnham </em>v. <em>Mark IV Homes, Inc., </em>387 Mass. 575, 581 (1982) (sale of defective modular home); <em>Linthicum </em>v. <em>Archambault, </em>379 Mass. 381, 387 (1979) (defective roof); <em>Whelihan </em>v. <em>Markowski, </em>37 Mass. App. Ct. 209, 210-211 (1994) (property manager knowingly placed plate glass rather than safety glass in tenant\u2019s rear door), and that a breach of warranty constitutes an unfair or deceptive practice in violation of G. L. c. 93A. See <em>Maillet </em>v. <em>ATF-Davidson Co., </em>407 Mass. 185, 193 (1990), and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-5\">While case-by-case adjudication whether a particular product is defective, unmerchantable, or unfit constitutes one way in which the product\u2019s sale may be defined as an unfair or deceptive act or practice under G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 2 <em>(a), </em>regulation by the Attorney General, if otherwise proper, constitutes an equally valid method for defining conduct unlawful under the statute. The Attorney General has, through the regulations, sought to take preventative action as to defective handguns, consistent with the authority granted to him by the Legislature of \u201cdefining with specificity acts and practices which violate G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 2 (a).\u201d <em>Purity Supreme, supra </em>at 775.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b898-6\">(b) A second basis of general authority exists to support the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"879\">*879</page-number>Attorney General\u2019s promulgation of the regulations. Subsequent to the issuance of the regulations, and during the pendency of this litigation, St. 1998, c. 180, \u201cAn Act relative to gun control in the commonwealth\u201d (Act), was enacted into law. The Act amends numerous provisions of G. L. c. 140, \u00a7\u00a7 121-131P, dealing with the sale of firearms, to impose criminal and other penalties on licensed firearms merchants who transfer firearms, including handguns, in violation of the Act\u2019s prohibitions.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Insofar as relevant here, various provisions found in the Act repeat virtually word for word the content of certain of the Attorney General\u2019s regulations.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark>,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b899-5\">The Attorney General points to the Act as conferring general <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"880\">*880</page-number>authority on him to impose G. L. c. 93A liability in the regulations as an adjunct to safety and performance requirements imposed by the Legislature on handguns in order to protect the public\u2019s health, safety, or welfare. The general authority claimed by the Attorney General has been recognized both with respect to 940 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 3.16(3) (1993),<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> <em>see Calimlim </em>v. <em>Foreign Car Ctr., Inc., supra </em>at 235; <em>MacGillivary </em>v. <em>W. Dana Bartlett Ins. Agency of Lexington, Inc., </em>14 Mass. App. Ct. 52, 60-61 (1982); see also <em>Piccuirro </em>v. <em>Gaienby, </em>20 Mass. App. Ct. 286, 290 (1985), and with respect to the Attorney General\u2019s implementation of specific G. L. c. 93A liability in connection with legislation or regulations promulgated by other agencies, prohibiting certain conduct. See <em>Rudow </em>v. <em>Commissioner of the Div. of Medical Assistance, ante </em>218, 226 &amp; n.10 (1999) (940 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"881\">*881</page-number>Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7\u00a7 4.00 et seq. [1994] [long-term care facilities]); <em>Boston Hous. Auth. </em>v. <em>Howard, </em>427 Mass. 537, 539 (1998) (940 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 3.17 [1993] [landlord-tenant regulations]); <em>Urman </em>v. <em>South Boston Sav. Bank, </em>424 Mass. 165, 168-170 (1997) (940 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 3.16[2] [1993] [disclosure regulation]); <em>Maillet </em>v. <em>ATF-Davidson Co., supra </em>at 193 (940 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 3.08[2] [1993] [warranty regulations]); <em>Calimlim </em>v. <em>Foreign Car Ctr., Inc., supra </em>at 229-230 (940 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 5.04[2][g] [1978] [motor vehicle regulations]); <em>Hannon </em>v. <em>Original Gunite Aquatech Pools, Inc., </em>385 Mass. 813, 821 (1982) (warranty regulations); <em>Homsi </em>v. <em>C.H. Babb Co., </em>10 Mass. App. Ct. 474, 478-479 (1980) (disclosure regulation). As has been mentioned, the Attorney General\u2019s power continues to exist unless the promulgated regulations conflict with the legislative scheme, see, e.g., <em>Lowell Gas Co. </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen., </em>377 Mass. 37, 42-43 (1979); <em>Dodd </em>v. <em>Commercial Union Ins. Co., </em>373 Mass. 72, 76-78 (1977), or the area is one as to which the Legislature has expressly or implicitly covered the field in a way which precludes further remediation by regulation under G. L. c. 93A. See <em>Reiter Oldsmobile, Inc. </em>v. <em>General Motors Corp., supra </em>at 711-712; <em>DePasquale </em>v. <em>Ogden Suffolk Downs, Inc., supra </em>at 662.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-5\">The plaintiffs accept this authority in its broad terms when they say in their brief the following: \u201cThe Attorney General points out (and Plaintiffs do not dispute), that violation of a statute designed to protect the public\u2019s \u2018health, safety or welfare\u2019 is deemed, by independent operation of 940 [Code Mass. Regs.] \u00a7 3.16 (3), a violation of c. 93A.\u201d The plaintiffs then go on to attempt to refute the existence of this authority in this case by putting forth the following argument: \u201cIn making this (generic) reference to \u2018unfairness,\u2019 and attempting, essentially, to equate his regulatory authority with that of the Legislature, the Attorney General blithely ignores a key point . . . \u2018violations\u2019 of these \u2018statutory standards\u2019 are deemed \u2018unfair practices\u2019 <em>only </em>after a plaintiff brings a claim for relief which is then litigated with reference to the aforementioned statute and, ultimately, <em>adjudicated </em>in plaintiff\u2019s favor. At bottom, none of this reasoning speaks at all to the Attorney General\u2019s power to regulate in the first instance under [\u00a7] 2 (c).\u201d (Emphasis in original.)</p>\n<p id=\"b901-6\">This argument is wrong. As we have said, while reliance on 940 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 3.16(3) is one way the Attorney General may seek to impose G. L. c. 93A liability, he has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"882\">*882</page-number>consistently promulgated regulations, on a preventative basis, to coordinate G. L. c. 93A liability with legislative proscription of unlawful conduct.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> It is of no significance that the Act came after the regulations. Except as noted below,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> we also do not see an impediment to the Attorney General\u2019s authority in the fact that the Act confers on the colonel of the Department of State Police and the. Secretary of the Executive Office of Public Safety the authority to promulgate regulations which implement its provisions. St. 1998, c. 180, \u00a7\u00a7 2, 21. The Act is predominantly criminal in nature and these public officials would logically be expected to be chosen by the Legislature as the parties who are in the best position to further define its provisions.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> We see no reason to draw from the Legislature\u2019s delegation of authority to these officials an implied preclusion of authority on the part of the Attorney General to act under G. L. c. 93A. We are satisfied that the Attorney General has an independent basis of authority to regulate in the area of handgun sales for the reasons just discussed.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-5\">In summary, we are satisfied that the Attorney General\u2019s regulatory authority under G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 2 (c),' regarding defective products is not limited to marketing and disclosure issues as the plaintiffs contend. His authority properly extends to regulating the sale of a product as unfair or deceptive when the product is defective in ways which a purchaser would not anticipate or the product is not as warranted, and to regulating in a manner which coordinates G. L. c. 93A liability with legislation declaring certain acts unlawful.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"883\">*883</page-number>(c) So viewed, the Attorney General\u2019s action is not inconsistent or incongruent with the rules, regulations, and decisions of the FTC or the Federal Courts\u2019 interpretations of the FTC Act. The FTC has deemed \u201c[ujnjustified consumer injury\u201d as \u201cthe primary focus of the FTC Act,\u201d 1980 Unfairness Statement, reprinted at 104 F.T.C. 1070, 1073 (1984), and has expressly stated that \u201cunwarranted health and safety risks may support a finding of unfairness.\u201d <em>Matter of Int\u2019l Harvester Co., </em>104 F.T.C. 949, 1061 (1984), quoting 1980 Unfairness Statement, <em>supra. </em>Certainly the health and safety risks associated with a defective product would be unjustified.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b903-5\">(d) Finally, the judge\u2019s determination that G. L. c. 93A is restricted primarily, if not exclusively, to addressing economic harm is not supported by our cases interpreting the statute. We have expressly recognized that the category of injuries cognizable under G. L. c. 93A extends to other kinds of injuries. See <em>Maillet </em>v. <em>ATF-Davidson Co., supra </em>at 192 (personal injuries cognizable under G. L. c. 93A); <em>Leardi </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>394 Mass. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"884\">*884</page-number>151, 158-159 (1985) (compensable injuries under G. L. c. 93A need not involve loss of money or property but include any \u201cinvasion of any legally protected interest of another\u201d). See also <em>Matter of Int'l Harvester, supra </em>at 1064 &amp; n.54 (FTC\u2019s jurisdiction reaches personal injury).</p>\n<p id=\"b904-5\">2. We come now to the disposition of the appeal. The conclusions we have reached both establish that the Attorney General\u2019s authority is not as rigidly limited as the judge determined, and dissipate the legal grounds on which the preliminary injunction was granted. The plaintiffs make no other arguments, apart from those we have considered and rejected, to support the allowance of a preliminary injunction as broad as the one entered. Accordingly, the preliminary injunction is vacated. We see no reason not to allow the immediate implementation of those regulations which are not the subject of dispute<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> and those regulations which exactly or substantially replicate provisions of the Act restricting the sale or transfer of nonconforming handguns.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> The Superior Court should hold a prompt hearing to identify such regulations and thereafter enter an order which allows their implementation. We expect that the Attorney General will take no action to implement any of the regulations until the question of the validity of the regulations just described is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"885\">*885</page-number>settled. Implementation of the remaining disputed regulations is to be stayed. As to these regulations, there are to be further proceedings in the Superior Court to determine their validity, and to dispose of the plaintiffs\u2019 other claims that relate to these regulations. When the proceedings are concluded, an appropriate declaratory judgment and orders are to be entered.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b892-7\">The handgun sales regulations were to be implemented in three phases: January 15, 1998; June 30, .1998; and September 30, 1998. At the June 24, 1998, Superior Court hearing on the plaintiffs\u2019 application for a preliminary injunction, the plaintiffs stated that they were not seeking injunctive relief from enforcement of those regulations that took effect on January 15, 1998, in particular, 940 Code Mass.

For example, \u00a7 16.05 of the regulations, concerning the transfer of handguns without childproofing or safety devices, imposes different requirements from those found in the Act. See G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 131K, inserted by St. 1998, c. 180, \u00a7 47. The Act specifies that firearms, including handguns, delivered without locking devices are \u201cdefective,\u201d and that their sale is a violation of G. L. c. 93A. <em>Id. </em>The locking devices are required to be approved by the colonel of the Department of State Police. <em>Id. </em>The Attorney General has indicated that he intends to make the regulations consistent with the Act by amending \u00a7 16.05 to incorporate the requirements of the Act. In addition, \u00a7 16.03 of the regulations, concerning tamper-resistant serial numbers, addresses an area where the Legislature has imposed certain requirements. See G. L. c. 269, \u00a7\u00a7 11C and 11E. Finally, the Act exempts from the requirements found in G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 123, Eighteenth to Twenty-first, the sale of firearms stockpiled before the statute\u2019s effective date, see St. 1998, c. 180, \u00a7 79, whereas the regulations do not exempt such sales.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b900-7\">Title 940 Code Mass.

L. c. 93A been viewed by the courts, the Legislature, or the Attorney General regulating in other areas, to be so limited. Relying on <em>Matter of Int\u2019l Harvester Co., </em>104 F.T.C. 949 (1984), and the FTC\u2019s 1964 Statement of Purpose of Trade Regulation Rule, 29 Fed. Reg. 8324, 8354 (1964), the plaintiffs contend that product safety regulations governing the sale or use of dangerous products are beyond the scope of the FTC\u2019s unfairness jurisdiction, and thus beyond the scope of G. L. c. 93A. The plaintiffs obfuscate the issue in this case. We are not concerned in this case with the Attorney General\u2019s proposed regulation of products that, although dangerous in nature, may nonetheless be merchantable because they are \u201cfit for the ordinary purposes for which [they] are used.\u201d G. L. c. 106, \u00a7 2-314 (1), (2) (c). Rather, at issue is the propriety of regulations governing the sale of products that are defective and thereby unmerchantable. The fundamental purpose of the regulations is to assure consumers that the products they are purchasing, although dangerous, nonetheless are merchantable. The FTC clearly has jurisdiction to regulate the sale of defective products. See, e.g., <em>Matter of Int\u2019l Harvester Co., supra </em>(where FTC determined that manufacturer\u2019s failure to take adequate measures to inform consumers of simple measures by which they could have avoided injury from product was unfair practice); <em>Matter of Philip Morris, Inc., </em>82 F.T.C. 16 (1973) (where FTC determined that distribution of sample razor blades by means of home-delivered newspapers constituted a \u201chazard to . . . health and safety,\u201d and was thus an unfair practice); <em>Matter of Chemway Corp., </em>78 F.T.C. 1250 (1971) (where FTC determined that it was an unfair practice to sell a toothbrush treated with a solution of phenyl mercuric acetate, a product that may constitute a danger to the consumer by adding to the body\u2019s burden of mercury).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b904-6\">For example, the judge permitted the implementation of so much of \u00a7 16.06(3) of the regulations as require disclosure of available test results for the same make and model of handguns.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b904-7\">In his main brief, the Attorney General points out that the Act exempts manufacturers from coverage, instead placing liability on local firearms dealers. See St. 1998, c. 180, \u00a7 8. The plaintiffs make no argument that the regulations\u2019 applicability to handgun manufacturers creates a difference between the statute and the regulations that is of any relevance. We agree with the Attorney General\u2019s position that the distinction is not pertinent, and we discern nothing in the Act which either explicitly or implicitly excludes application of G. L. c. 93A liability to a broader category of persons or entities than those designated in the Act. The Legislature has defined certain conduct related to the sale of guns as unlawful, and we do not perceive any reason why the Attorney General may not regulate, as an adjunct to the Act and in a way that does not conflict with the Act, to prevent the sale of the unlawful products to consumers by stopping the flow of the products into Massachusetts. Cf. <em>Lowell Gas. Co. </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen., </em>377 Mass. 37, 42 (1979) (\u201cthe mere existence of one regulatory statute does not affect the applicability of a broader, nonconflicting statute\u201d such as G. L. c. 93A). Moreover, the regulations are designed to ensure that sales not destined for Massachusetts consumers are not affected by the regulations. See, e.g., 940 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 16.07 (excluding various types of sales from the regulations). We note as well that two of the plaintiffs appear to be firearms dealers and not manufacturers.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
