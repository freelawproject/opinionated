He moved to dismiss the charge, alleging a violation of his right to an independent medical examination under G. L. c. 263, \u00a7 5A. The motion judge granted the motion. The Commonwealth appealed. We transferred the case here on our own motion and now remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-11\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b190-12\">Shortly after midnight, a State trooper saw the defendant driving erratically and, after following him for a while, stopped him. While speaking with the defendant, the trooper noticed that his speech was slurred and that there was an odor of alcohol coming from his vehicle. The trooper then asked the defendant to step out of his vehicle to perform a series of field sobriety tests. The defendant admitted that he had had something to drink that evening. He had some difficulty performing various sobriety tests, skipping and transposing some letters on the alphabet test, skipping some numbers and counting too far on the \u201ccount backwards\u201d test, and losing his balance during the one-legged stand. The trooper concluded that the defendant was intoxicated, arrested him, and transported him to the State police barracks.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-13\">At the barracks, an inventory of the defendant\u2019s possessions showed that he had with him $465 in cash. The defendant was informed shortly after 1 a.m. of his Miranda rights and of his rights to make a telephone call, take a breathalyzer test, and have an independent medical examination. He refused to sign a form acknowledging that he had been informed of these rights, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>refused the blood test offered by the police, and refused to take a breathalyzer test. He did, however, inform the police that he wished to exercise his right to an independent medical examination. He also exercised his right to use the telephone and asked his father to come to the barracks for him. The trooper stood nearby during this telephone call and heard what the defendant said. The defendant\u2019s father did come to the barracks, but was denied access to his son. Neither the defendant nor the police had told the father that the defendant had asked for an independent medical examination. About twenty-five minutes after the defendant arrived at the barracks, the desk officer at the barracks called a bail magistrate<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> to arrange a bail hearing. The desk officer told the magistrate that the defendant had been arrested for driving while under the influence and told him that he smelled of alcohol and that he had bloodshot eyes and slurred speech. The magistrate declined to come to the barracks to hold a bail hearing at that time and told the police to hold the defendant until the morning. The magistrate made this decision according to his policy of holding until morning defendants arrested for driving while under the influence who had refused to take a breathalyzer test. The defendant was finally released at approximately 8:40 a.m.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">The defendant filed a motion to dismiss the complaint, alleging a deprivation of his right to a prompt bail hearing and of his right to an independent medical examination under G. L. c. 263, \u00a7 5A.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The motion judge granted this motion, finding that the police had informed the defendant of his right to such an examination and that the defendant had told the police of his intention to exercise it, but that the bail magistrate had been remiss in refusing to hold a bail hearing according to G. L. c. 276, \u00a7 58. This prevented the defendant from exercising his right under \u00a7 5A.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-6\">The Commonwealth appealed from the dismissal of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>charges against the defendant, arguing that dismissal was inappropriate because the police fulfilled their obligations under G. L. c. 263, \u00a7 5A, and under G. L. c. 276, \u00a7\u00a7 57-58, which concerns a defendant\u2019s right to a bail hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">n</p>\n<p id=\"b192-6\">In most of the cases in which a defendant moves for dismissal due to a G. L. c. 263, \u00a7 5A, violation, the defendant\u2019s primary allegation is that his rights have been violated by police conduct, either by their failure to apprise him of his rights under that section or by their active hindrance of his exercise of those rights. In this case, by contrast, the primary allegation is that the defendant\u2019s rights were violated by the bail magistrate, who declined to come to the police barracks to hold a bail hearing immediately on being notified by the police of the defendant\u2019s arrest and detention.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-7\">It is undisputed that the police informed the defendant of his right to an independent medical examination, as they are required to do by \u00a7 5A. As the defendant recognizes, once the police have fulfilled their duty to inform a defendant of his right under \u00a7 5A, they have no obligation to help him in exercising that right. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hampe, </em>419 Mass. 514, 520 (1995); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Alano, </em>388 Mass. 871, 876-877 (1983); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McIntyre, </em>36 Mass. App. Ct. 193, 202, 204 (1994). Rather, the statute places on the defendant the responsibility of availing himself of that right once told of it. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Finelli, </em>422 Mass. 860, 862 (1996). If he does not do so, he cannot later seek dismissal of the charges against him based on a violation of \u00a7 5A, because there has been no violation of that right. In this case, the motion judge specifically found that the defendant asserted his right to an independent medical examination. Although the Commonwealth asserts in its brief that the defendant did not attempt to exercise this right, we defer to the motion judge\u2019s finding of fact in the absence of clear error. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Magee, </em>423 Mass. 381, 384-385 (1996), and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-8\">Although the police were not required to assist the defendant in exercising his rights and thus were not, for example, required to transport him to the hospital for administration of a blood alcohol test or to arrange for a physician to travel to the police station, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hampe, supra </em>at 521; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rosewarne, </em>410 Mass. 53, 54-55 (1991); <em>Com</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number><em>monwealth </em>v. <em>Alano, </em>supra; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McIntyre, supra </em>at 204, they were obligated to afford the defendant a \u201creasonable opportunity\u201d to exercise his right to an independent medical examination, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ames, </em>410 Mass. 603, 606 (1991); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McIntyre, supra </em>at 203, and were forbidden from impeding his exercise of that right, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Alano, supra </em>at 876-877. The defendant argues that the police in fact interfered with his exercise of the right to an independent examination by failing, when they called the bail magistrate, to inform him that the defendant had money on his person, that his father was coming to pick him up, or that he was exercising his right to an independent medical examination. He argues further that the bail magistrate also violated his \u00a7 5A right by failing to conduct a bail hearing with reasonable promptness, which prevented him from obtaining an independent medical examination. With respect to \u00a7 5A, as is discussed below, the crucial question is whether a defendant\u2019s right to an independent medical examination has been violated, and not who violated it.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">The right to a prompt bail hearing intersects with the \u00a7 5A right, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Finelli, supra; Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Chistolini, </em>422 Mass. 854, 858 (1996): a defendant ordinarily will be unable to exercise his right to an independent medical examination without being promptly released to bail. Normally, a defendant must go to a hospital if he wishes an independent medical examination because of the difficulty of finding medical personnel willing to come to a police station to draw blood for a blood test. See <em>Finelli, supra </em>at 861. And this usually means that the defendant will have to be released from custody, as the police have no obligation to transport him to the hospital for the blood test, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hampe, supra </em>at 521; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rosewarne, supra </em>at 54; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Alano, supra </em>at 876-877; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McIntyre, supra </em>at 204, and normally refuse to do so, see, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rosewarne, supra </em>at 54 (defendant telephoned hospital to arrange test but police refused to transport him); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McIntyre, supra </em>at 201 (police refused to transport defendant to hospital four blocks away). Because the evidence that may be obtained through the blood test is fleeting, such a test must be conducted promptly; thus, the bail hearing must be conducted promptly. Where the bail magistrate refuses to conduct a prompt bail hearing, the arrestee\u2019s right to an independent medical examination is necessarily frustrated.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>There was no permissible ground for the bail magistrate\u2019s refusal to hold a bail hearing for the defendant promptly on being notified of the defendant\u2019s arrest. Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Troy, </em>38 Mass. App. Ct. 969, 970 (1995) (motion judge\u2019s view that there was \u201cnothing improper in the police officers\u2019 holding the defendant in custody until he had sobered up\u201d was \u201cwrong\u201d). He declined to come to the barracks to conduct a bail hearing according to a \u201cpolicy\u201d of his own, pursuant to which he asked the police whether a detainee had submitted to a breathalyzer test and, if not, what was the officer\u2019s opinion of the detainee\u2019s state of intoxication. He would then instruct the police to hold until morning those detainees who had refused to take the breathalyzer test. In an affidavit submitted by the bail magistrate to the motion judge, he stated that his reasons for ordering such detainees to be held until morning were the \u201csafety of the public as well as . . . avoid[ance of] personal liability for actions of the defendant post-release.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">General Laws c. 276, \u00a7 58, provides that a \u201cjustice or a clerk . . . shall, when a person is held under arrest or committed either with or without a warrant for an offense other than an offense punishable by death . . . hold a hearing in which the defendant and his counsel, if any, may participate and inquire into the case and shall admit such person to bail on his personal recognizance without surety unless said justice [or] clerk . . . determines, in the exercise of his discretion, that such a release will not reasonably assure the appearance of the person before the court.\u201d Section 58 does not provide for the consideration of public safety in determining whether to release a person to bail.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Rather, the only permissible consideration is whether the defendant is reasonably likely to reappear before the court. See <em>Hampe, supra </em>at 519 (\u201can arrestee must be released on bail without surety unless there is a risk that he will not appear in court\u201d). Moreover, it cannot be argued that the police were properly holding the defendant in protective custody because they did not go through the statutory procedures prerequisite to such custody. See <em>id. </em>at 521-522. Nor can the bail magistrate\u2019s actions be justified on the basis of Rule 28 of the Rules Govem<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>ing Persons Authorized to Take Bail (1998), which requires that persons admitted to bail understand the nature of bail and any conditions of release. Where an individual is so intoxicated that he cannot be expected to understand the nature of the bail proceedings, intoxication is a \u201cjustifiable basis for extending the reasonable time delay\u201d before which the bail hearing must be held. <em>Chistolini, supra </em>at 857. See <em>Finelli, supra </em>at 863. There has been no allegation in this case that the bail magistrate\u2019s delay in conducting the bail hearing was based on his belief that the defendant could not understand the proceedings, and the evidence does not suggest that the defendant was unable to do so.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">Because the bail magistrate was not justified in refusing on public safety grounds to come to the barracks to conduct a bail hearing, he failed to fulfil his obligations under \u00a7 58, which states that he \u201cshall\u201d conduct such a hearing on being notified of the individual\u2019s arrest, see <em>Hampe, supra </em>at 519, and under Rule 14 of the Rules Governing Persons Authorized to Take Bail.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> As the court has said, \u201c[pjart of the responsibility of a bail commissioner is, as rule 14 provides, \u2018to respond with all reasonable promptness to calls for their services.\u2019 \u201d <em>Hampe, supra, </em>quoting Rule 14. The definition of promptness has not been precisely defined, and \u201c[n] either the Federal or State Constitution!], the bail statute, G. L. c. 276, \u00a7\u00a7 57-58, Rule 14 of the Rules Governing Persons Authorized to Take Bail (1996), nor our case law establish a fixed time period within which a bail hearing must be held.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Falco, </em>43 Mass. App. Ct. 253, 255 (1997). This court has, however, inferred from the six-hour limit on police questioning, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rosario, </em>422 Mass. 48, 56 (1996), that bail hearings should be held within roughly six hours of booking. See <em>Chistolini, supra </em>at 856. Where the bail magistrate waited for over seven hours to conduct the bail hearing, he failed to respond with the promptness required and, therefore, violated the defendant\u2019s right to a prompt bail hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">This violation, in turn, resulted in the frustration of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>defendant\u2019s right to an independent medical examination under \u00a7 5A. For the right to an independent examination to mean anything, it must include the opportunity to have the examination conducted as promptly as possible. The opportunity to collect potentially exculpatory medical evidence is destroyed if the defendant is made to wait seven hours before obtaining it. Therefore, because a defendant ordinarily must be released on bail before he is able to obtain an independent medical examination, the bail hearing must be conducted promptly if \u00a7 5A is to have any force. This court decided in <em>Hampe, supra </em>at 518, 521, that \u201cfor G. L. c. 263, \u00a7 5A, to have its intended force and effect, it must be read as requiring the police to telephone a bail commissioner\u201d in order \u201cto facilitate a defendant\u2019s release in a timely fashion.\u201d This requirement, addressed specifically to police conduct, would mean nothing if it were not assumed that the bail commissioner would then hold a bail hearing and release the defendant \u201cin a timely fashion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 521.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">In a case in which the defendant has asserted his \u00a7 5A right, it will not do to define timeliness by the six-hour guideline for promptness applicable to bail hearings in general. Because of the fleeting nature of the evidence that might be obtained as a result of the medical examination, the bail hearing in such a case must be held as promptly as possible. Therefore, when the bail commissioner is notified that an individual has been arrested and wishes to exercise his right to an independent medical examination under \u00a7 5A, the bail commissioner must respond as promptly as he is able. The bail magistrate\u2019s delay of more than seven hours in this case does not meet this standard of timeliness.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-6\">In cases where the defendant has not asserted his \u00a7 5A right, the general rule of promptness, loosely delimited by the six-hour guideline, still holds. Therefore, to ensure that the bail magistrate responds as promptly as possible, it is crucial that he be aware when a defendant has asserted the \u00a7 5A right. When it is the police who notify the bail magistrate that an individual who has asserted the right has been arrested, the police must also inform the magistrate that the defendant wishes to exercise the right. The police may, of course, leave it to the defendant to call the bail magistrate after informing the defendant of this possibility and permitting him to use the telephone. In that case, it will be up to the defendant to tell the bail magistrate that he wishes to exercise his \u00a7 5A right. In the instant case, where the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>trooper called the bail magistrate, he should have informed him \u2022that the defendant had expressed a desire to obtain an independent medical examination. If the arrested person expresses a desire for an independent medical examination after an officer has called the bail commissioner, he must call again or allow the arrested person to do so. To avoid this complication, it would be better to make the \u00a7 5A statement before the bail magistrate is called.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">HI</p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">It remains to determine the appropriate remedy for the violation of the defendant\u2019s rights to a prompt bail hearing and to an independent medical examination. The defendant moved that the charge against him be dismissed, and the motion judge granted the motion. The Commonwealth argues that dismissal is an inappropriate remedy in the circumstances presented here. \u201cSection 5A does not state the consequences that should flow from a violation of its terms.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ames, </em>410 Mass. 603, 607 (1991). Therefore, the task of fashioning remedies is left to the courts, which must provide a remedy appropriate to the circumstances of each case. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Andrade, </em>389 Mass. 874, 878 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b197-7\">In determining the proper remedy for violations of \u00a7 5A, we have never explicitly set out the appropriate method of analysis. This has created confusion about whether and in what circumstances dismissal is required. Some decisions have suggested that a major factor in determining whether to dismiss the charge is whether dismissal would deter future violations by the police. In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Atencio, </em>12 Mass. App. Ct. 747 (1981), the defendant was taken to a hospital by the police after being injured in an automobile accident. The police, who were preoccupied with duties including assisting other victims of the accident, did not inform the defendant of his right to an independent medical examination by the physician of his choice under \u00a7 5A. The defendant was, however, treated for his injuries at the hospital. Despite the violation of \u00a7 5A, the Appeals Court upheld the motion judge\u2019s denial of the motion to dismiss because \u201cthe available police officers were fully occupied by various aspects of the exigency. There was no indication in the evidence of any police attempt or desire to avoid or subvert the policy behind \u00a7 5A. Thus the application of any sanction of exclusion of evidence would have been wholly inappropriate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>and would not have had any \u2018prophylactic\u2019 tendency to prevent improper police conduct in other cases.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 750.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">Other decisions have been less explicit about the importance of the deterrent effect but have considered, in fashioning a remedy, the state of mind of the police when they violated the statute. In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hampe, supra </em>at 521, 522, this court stated that \u201c[dismissal may be deemed appropriate where there is deliberate or intentional misconduct by the police,\u201d and that the \u201cframe of mind or the good faith of the police\u201d is relevant in determining the proper remedy. See <em>Rosewarne, supra </em>at 57 (in fashioning remedy, court should consider extent of police misconduct). In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kelley, </em>404 Mass. 459, 464 (1989), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Andrade, </em>389 Mass. 874, 879 (1983), this court remanded a case for further consideration of factors including \u201cthe absence of police effort to inform the defendant of his right to an examination\u201d and \u201cexigent circumstances \u2018which might have justified the police officers\u2019 failure to communicate the defendant\u2019s right to him.\u2019 \u201d Both of these factors are relevant to whether the police intentionally violated the defendant\u2019s rights and, therefore, to whether the violations could be deterred through dismissal of the charge or suppression of evidence. The considerations mentioned in these decisions would not have been relevant unless the court considered dismissal to be a prophylactic measure.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-6\">Some decisions have suggested that dismissal is an unduly severe remedy for violation of \u00a7 5A rights and that suppression of evidence obtained after the violation occurred would be more appropriate. Such remedies are similar to those implemented under the exclusionary rule for violations under the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution. In <em>Hampe, supra </em>at 523-524, this court noted that dismissal is not appropriate when there is overwhelming evidence of intoxication, and went on to say that the appropriate remedy in such cases is ordinarily suppression of the breathalyzer result as well as suppression of police testimony about events occurring after violation of the right.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>The Commonwealth urges that, because it was the bail magistrate and, at least in its view, not law enforcement officers who violated the defendant\u2019s rights, dismissal is not an appropriate response. The Commonwealth cites as support <em>Arizona </em>v. <em>Evans, </em>514 U.S. 1 (1995), a case involving a motion to suppress evidence obtained through an unconstitutional police search that would not have occurred but for a clerical error by a court clerk. In <em>Evans, </em>the Supreme Court of the United States held that the exclusionary rule did not apply where the Fourth Amendment violation resulted from the actions of a judicial officer, because exclusion of evidence in such a case would not have the deterrent effect on law enforcement officers that is the purpose of the exclusionary rule. <em>Id. </em>at 15-16.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">This court\u2019s occasional emphasis on considerations of deterrence and prophylactic effect in the \u00a7 5A context and the Commonwealth\u2019s reliance on <em>Evans </em>in this case are both misplaced, and for the same reason. The exclusionary rule, which <em>Evans </em>addressed, prohibits the use of otherwise probative and often highly reliable evidence in order to deter future violations by the police of a right extrinsic and even contrary to the truth-finding process \u2014 the right under the Fourth Amendment to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures. The right to an independent medical examination under \u00a7 5A, by contrast, is a fight meant to enhance the establishment of the truth of the accusation by enabling the defendant to obtain potentially exculpatory evidence. Therefore, dismissal is appropriate where \u00a7 5A rights have been violated, regardless of whether the violation occurred at the hands of the police or of the bail commissioner, because dismissal in such a case is not solely a prophylactic measure intended to deter future misconduct by either. Rather, it is primarily meant to prevent prosecution and conviction of an individual who, had he been able to obtain an independent medical examination, might have been able to disprove or deflect the charges against him. A violation of \u00a7 5A interferes with an accused person\u2019s ability to rebut the charges against him. The accused suffers that denial of right, whether it is a law enforcement or a judicial officer who is responsible for the violation, and whether the action is done wilfully or in good faith. In any event, the truth-finding process is not as reliable as the Legislature required it to be. To be sure, dismissal or exclusion of evidence may also serve to deter future violations, but that is a secondary consideration: it is the present violation that in itself interferes with the process the Legislature required.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>This reasoning is entirely consistent with our cases holding that a violation of \u00a7 5A does not mandate dismissal where there is overwhelming evidence of intoxication. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Priestley, </em>419 Mass. 678, 680-681 (1995); <em>Hampe, supra </em>at 523; <em>Antes, supra </em>at 607. In such a case, the evidence that might have been obtained through an independent medical examination would have been unlikely to assist the defendant in mounting a defense and would not have contradicted the other evidence of intoxication in the case. Whether there was overwhelming evidence of intoxication is a decision to be made by the courts in fashioning a remedy for a \u00a7 5A violation, not one that may be made by the police or bail commissioner in deciding that they need not comply with the requirements of \u00a7 5A. It remains true that \u201cstrict compliance with the requirements of G. L. c. 263, \u00a7 5A, should be the unaltered practice.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McIntyre, </em>36 Mass. App. Ct. 193, 202 (1994), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gruska, </em>30 Mass. App. Ct. 940, 942 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Andrade, </em>389 Mass. 874, 879 (1983), responding to the Commonwealth\u2019s argument that the defendant had failed to show prejudice, we said that we did not \u201cthink . . . that the defendant should be required to make this proof.\u201d Our reasoning there is consistent with today\u2019s holding. We did not mean to suggest that prejudice is irrelevant, but that a violation of \u00a7 5A will result in prejudice in most cases where the Commonwealth has not presented overwhelming evidence of intoxication. In addressing the appropriate remedy, the court stated that the remedy should be \u201cadequate to cure potential or actual prejudice resulting from a violation of G. L. c. 263, \u00a7 5A.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 878. See <em>Hampe, supra </em>at 522-523, citing <em>Andrade, supra </em>at 878-879, 881-882. Other cases have relied explicitly on a prejudice inquiry, stating that dismissal would not be appropriate absent such a showing. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Finelli, </em>422 Mass. 860, 863 (1996) (\u201cDismissal is a drastic remedy and in this context is not proper absent prejudice\u201d); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Atencio, </em>12 Mass. App. Ct. 747, 750 (1981) (no dismissal because defendant \u201cestablished no significant prejudice from the omission of the statutory notice\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b200-6\">Where a defendant\u2019s right under \u00a7 5A has been violated, the violation itself is prima facie evidence that the defendant has been prejudiced in that his opportunity to obtain and present potentially exculpatory evidence has been restricted or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>destroyed. This presumption of prejudice, however, may be overcome by overwhelming evidence of intoxication, as discussed above, or by other evidence indicating that the omission was not prejudicial in the circumstances. See, e.g., <em>Ames, supra </em>at 606-608 (police transported defendant to hospital for treatment of injuries and offered him a blood test, which he refused; although police did not inform defendant of \u00a7 5A right specifically, there was no prejudice because judge found that defendant would not have exercised it even if it had been offered); <em>McIntyre, supra </em>at 203 (police violated \u00a7 5A by failing to inform defendant of right to independent examination; defendant, an attorney, was aware of right and exercised it; no prejudice because literal compliance with statute would not have accorded defendant any more notice than he already had); <em>Gruska, supra </em>at 941-942 (police showed defendant copy of \u00a7 5A, but did not literally comply with statute by posting copy of statute or giving copy to defendant; no prejudice because defendant was adequately notified of \u00a7 5A right).</p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">Applying this rule to the instant case, we must consider whether the prima facie prejudice to the defendant\u2019s case, created by the bail magistrate\u2019s violation of his \u00a7 5A right, is overcome by other evidence. The motion judge made no explicit factual findings concerning the level of the defendant\u2019s intoxication, and this question is disputed by the parties. We therefore remand the case to the District Court for a determination whether the evidence of the defendant\u2019s intoxication was overwhelming or whether other factors rendered the violation harmless in the circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b191-7\">General Laws c. 276, \u00a7 58, provides, in part, that a \u201cjustice or a clerk or assistant clerk of the district court, a bail commissioner or master in chancery\u201d may conduct a bail hearing. These officials are referred to as bail commissioners. See G.

The police official in charge of such station or place of detention, or his designee, shall inform him of such right immediately upon being booked, and shall afford him a reasonable opportunity to exercise it.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b194-6\">The only reference in \u00a7 58 to public safety, which permits the court to consider whether the release of an individual will seriously endanger any person or the community where the individual has been arrested for committing an offense while on release pending adjudication of a prior charge, is inapplicable in the present case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b195-7\">That an arrestee must be released on cash bail or bail on his own recognizance does not mean that the police must give him the keys to his vehicle and allow him to drive off if he is not in a fit condition to do so.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b195-8\">Rule 14 states that persons authorized to take bail are entitled to \u201cparticipate fairly in the out-of-court bailing activity,\u201d but only \u201cso long as they are willing and able to respond with all reasonable promptness to calls for their services.\u201d See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hampe, </em>419 Mass. 514, 519 (1995).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b198-7\">The opinion goes on to state that the defendant was \u201cafforded prompt and thorough medical care and examination at the hospital, and was seen by the doctors there. He thus has established no significant prejudice from the omission of the statutory notice.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Aterido, </em>12 Mass. App. Ct. 747, 750 (1981). The court does not explain, however, how the fact that the defendant obtained some form of medical care is relevant to his right to obtain the independent medical examination permitted the defendant under \u00a7 5A.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
