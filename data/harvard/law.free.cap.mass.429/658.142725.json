L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32E <em>(b). </em>The cocaine' was seized by a State trooper, who, while on routine traffic patrol at about 9 p.m. on March 5, 1997, stopped a taxicab on Route 195 near Marion, after he had seen the taxicab drift over <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>a marked lane into the breakdown lane. In the course of the stop, the trooper ordered the defendant, who was sitting in the rear of the taxi, to get out. After conversing with the defendant, the trooper searched the rear seat area and seized a package of cocaine weighing approximately seventy-eight grams. A judge in the Superior Court allowed the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress both the cocaine and his statements because the trooper had \u201cno objective basis upon which to order the defendant out of the vehicle.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Appeals Court affirmed the suppression order, relying on our case law under art. 14 of the Declaration of Rights of the Massachusetts Constitution, concluding, as did the Superior Court judge, that the trooper had no reasonable basis to support his order to the defendant to step out of the taxicab. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gonsalves, </em>46 Mass. App. Ct. 186 (1999). The Appeals Court rejected the Commonwealth\u2019s request that our law should be changed to conform to <em>Maryland </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>519 U.S. 408, 415 (1997), which holds that a police officer does not violate the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution, when the officer, in a routine traffic stop, orders a passenger out of the vehicle. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gonsalves, supra </em>at 187. We granted the Commonwealth\u2019s application for further appellate review to consider the Commonwealth\u2019s request. We are not persuaded that we should change our law developed under art. 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-5\">Based on the evidence that he found credible, the judge made findings of fact. We accept those facts, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Colon-Cruz, </em>408 Mass. 533, 538 (1990), and now summarize them. When the State trooper observed the taxicab traveling partly in the breakdown lane of the highway which he was patrolling, he became concerned that the driver might be under the influence of an intoxicant, and signaled for the driver to stop. The trooper approached the stopped taxicab, spoke to the driver, and noted that there were also two passengers in the car, including the defendant, who was the sole occupant of the back seat. The trooper took the taxicab driver\u2019s license and registration. He questioned the driver about his driving over the marked <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>lane, and the driver told the trooper that he had trouble with his night vision. In the course of questioning the driver, the trooper trained his flashlight on the occupants of the car, something which he routinely did on such stops for his personal safety. The trooper thought the defendant was extremely nervous. His hands were trembling and moving from his lap to the seat and back to his lap again, and he appeared to be breathing heavily. Because the defendant appeared nervous, the trooper ordered him to step out of the taxicab. The defendant complied, and the trooper conducted a patfnsk, which revealed nothing. He asked the defendant why he was nervous, and the defendant replied that there were warrants outstanding against him for driving without a license. At that point, the trooper \u201csecured\u201d the defendant in the rear seat of the police cruiser. He obtained permission from the driver of the taxicab to search the vehicle\u2019s back seat, where the trooper saw a portion of a plastic bag protruding from between the seat cushion and the seat back. The plastic bag contained white powder which the trooper suspected was cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-5\">The trooper returned to the cruiser, recited the Miranda rights to the defendant, and questioned him. The defendant denied knowledge of the plastic bag or any cocaine. After citing the taxicab driver for a marked lane violation, the trooper allowed the taxicab to leave. He then took the defendant to the Bourne barracks for further questioning. At first, the defendant continued to deny any knowledge of the bag of white powder, which weighed approximately seventy-eight grams, but, eventually, he made inculpatory statements in the trooper\u2019s presence.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-6\">1. In <em>Pennsylvania </em>v. <em>Mimms, </em>434 U.S. 106, 111 (1977), the United States Supreme Court held that a police officer may, as matter of course, order a driver out of a vehicle that has been lawfully stopped for a traffic violation. In <em>Maryland </em>v. <em>Wilson, supra </em>at 415, the Court extended that rule to approve similar orders given to passengers in a stopped vehicle.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Commonwealth argues that we have \u201cconsistently purported to follow <em>Mimms.\u201d </em>It relies on <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Santana, </em>420 Mass. 205, 212-213 (1995), for this statement, while acknowledging, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>as it must, that <em>Santana </em>contains language which \u201csquarely cuts against the [the United States Supreme] Court\u2019s holding in <em>Mimms.\u201d </em>Nonetheless, the Commonwealth argues that we should now expressly embrace <em>Mimms, </em>and its corollary, the ruling in <em>Wilson, </em>and make plain that our art. 14 case law coincides with the <em>Mimms-Wilson </em>holdings under the Fourth Amendment:</p>\n<p id=\"b681-5\">We have not adopted <em>Mimms.</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b681-6\">\u201cIt is true that cases from [the Appeals Court] and the Supreme Judicial Court have cited approvingly to <em>Mimms, </em>without expressly stating that the police are not entitled to carte blanche authority to order drivers out of their vehicles. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ferrara, </em>376 Mass. 502, 505 (1978); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Robbins, </em>407 Mass. 147, 151 (1990); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Moses, </em>408 Mass. 136, 142 (1990); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lantigua, </em>38 Mass. App. Ct. 526, 528-529 (1995).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b681-7\">\u201cHowever, a closer examination of these cases reveals that while explicit language requiring a \u2018reasonable suspicion\u2019 has not appeared, each case explored the factual basis for the officer\u2019s suspicion. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ferrara, </em>376 Mass. at 505 (finding no basis for further interrogation and no need for further protective precautions, and reversing order denying motion to suppress); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Robbins, </em>407 Mass. at 152 (police officer\u2019s actions proper where officer saw brown-handled object wedged in passenger seat and driver had just been arrested on outstanding warrant); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Moses, </em>408 Mass. at 138, 141-143 (police officer\u2019s actions proper where officer feared defendants had access to a weapon, was outnumbered by defendants, and one defendant, upon making eye contact with the officer, ducked under dashboard).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b681-8\"><em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>46 Mass. App. Ct. 181, 183-184 (1999). As the <em>Williams </em>opinion goes on to point out, what was implicit in the decisions just referred to, was made explicit in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Santana, supra, </em>where we stated that \u201c[t]o determine whether [an exit] order was justified, we ask \u2018whether a reasonably prudent man in the policeman\u2019s position would be warranted in the belief that the safety of the police or that of other persons was in danger.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Santana, supra </em>at 212-213, quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Almeida, </em>373 Mass. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>266, 271 (1977). This statement in <em>Santana </em>was reiterated two years later in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Vazquez, </em>426 Mass. 99, 102-103 (1997). Thus, the rule that a police officer must, at least, have a reasonable suspicion of danger before compelling a driver to leave his motor vehicle has been affirmed by this court well after the United States Supreme Court abandoned that requirement in <em>Mimms. </em>Because we have departed from the Federal view of a citizen\u2019s Fourth Amendment rights in the area, our long-standing rule expresses a principle of State constitutional law under art. 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-5\">We have expressly granted other protections to drivers and occupants of motor vehicles under art. 14 in a variety of areas, and we have done so to guarantee protections that, in some cases, may not be recognized under the Fourth Amendment. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Torres, </em>424 Mass. 153, 154-155, 157-164 (1997) (that passenger left vehicle, without being asked to do so, on routine traffic stop provides no basis to further detain driver and passenger after issuing speeding ticket); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>King, </em>389 Mass. 233, 244 (1983) (once officer, making valid investigatory check of parked car at rest area, verified driver\u2019s and passenger\u2019s licenses and vehicle registration, no grounds existed for further investigation or precautions); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Loughlin, </em>385 Mass. 60, 61-63 &amp; n.3 (1982) (search conducted after justifiable threshold inquiry wherein driver produced valid license and registration held impermissible); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ferrara, supra </em>at 504-505 (no basis to interrogate passengers after driver produced valid license and registration); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Alvarez, </em>44 Mass. App. Ct. 531, 534 (1998) (during routine stop for traffic violation, officer may not ask for passenger\u2019s identification as matter of \u201croutine practice\u201d); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ellsworth, </em>41 Mass. App. Ct. 554, 556-557 (1996) (after officer, having stopped driver for erratic driving, determined that there was no traffic offense and driver had produced valid license and registration, he had no reason to issue exit orders to passengers, in spite of earlier furtive movements of one passenger); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kimball, </em>37 Mass. App. Ct. 604, 607 (1994). (during stop on suspicion that car was stolen, once driver produced valid license and registration, he should have been permitted to leave). In view of these protections, and the principles expressed in the <em>Santana </em>decision, which were repeated in the <em>Vazquez </em>decision, we conclude that art. 14 requires that a police officer, in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>routine traffic stop, must have a reasonable belief that the officer\u2019s safety, or the safety of others, is in danger before ordering a driver out of a motor vehicle. The fact that we do not follow <em>Mimms </em>in this type of case necessarily leads to the conclusion that we shall not follow <em>Wilson </em>either, because <em>Wilson </em>extends <em>Mimms </em>in a manner incompatible with the rights guaranteed Massachusetts citizens under art. 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-5\">2. We now explain our reasons for reaching these conclusions and comment on some matters raised by the dissenting opinion in this case. A routine traffic stop, like the one in this case, presents a situation where citizens, both the vehicle\u2019s driver and any passenger or passengers in the vehicle, expect a police officer to get the government\u2019s business done quickly, so those detained can go on their way. This expectation is a reasonable one. A passenger in the stopped vehicle may harbor a special concern about the officer\u2019s conduct because the passenger usually had nothing to do with the operation, or condition, of the vehicle which drew the officer\u2019s attention in the first place. Citizens do not expect that police officers handling a routine traffic violation will engage, in the absence of justification, in stalling tactics, obfuscation, strained conversation, or unjustified exit orders, to prolong the seizure in the hope that, sooner or later, the stop might yield up some evidence of an arrestable crime. That a small percentage of routine traffic stops may result in the detection of more serious crime is no reason to subject the vast majority of citizens to orders to get out of their vehicles.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-6\">Such an intrusion into a driver or a passenger\u2019s privacy is not minimal. As was expressed by a dissent in <em>Mimms, </em>\u201c[a] woman stopped at night may fear for her own safety; a person in poor health may object to standing in the cold or rain; another who left home in haste to drive children or spouse to school or to the train may not be fully dressed; an elderly driver who presents no possible threat of violence may regard the police command as nothing more than an arrogant and unnecessary display of authority.\u201d <em>Pennsylvania </em>v. <em>Mimms, supra </em>at 120-121 (Stevens, J., dissenting). Routine traffic stops may also pose unique hardships on minorities who, it has been argued, are often the subject of stops on pretext. See Harris, \u201cDriving While Black\u201d and All Other Traffic Offenses: The Supreme Court and Pretextual Traffic Stops, 87 J. Crim. L. &amp; Criminology 544 (1997); Sklansky, Traffic Stops, Minority Motorists, and the Future of the Fourth <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>Amendment, 1997 Sup. Ct. Rev. 271. Justice Ireland\u2019s concurring opinion, with which we agree, makes this point more expansively. <em>Post </em>at 669-671. The rules in <em>Mimms </em>and <em>Wilson, </em>which permit automobile exit orders during any traffic stop, but which do not require that such orders be given, are a clear invitation to discriminatory enforcement of the rule.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b684-5\"><em>\u201cMimms </em>[and Wilson] rested on the logic, which we do not contest, that there is danger for a police officer inherent in any auto stop. <em>Mimms, </em>434 U.S. at 110, 111. However, to permit an officer, in the absence of any specific and articulable facts, to order the driver of a vehicle [and a passenger or passengers] to step out of the vehicle would be to invite random and unequal treatment of motorists. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bartlett, </em>41 Mass. App. Ct. 468, 472 (1996) (\u2018[t]he vice in interrogations and searches based on a hunch is their essentially random and arbitrary nature, a quality inconsistent, under constitutional norms . . . with a free and ordered society\u2019).\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Williams, supra </em>at 183. The safety of the police can be adequately protected. While a mere hunch is not enough, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Silva, </em>366 Mass. 402, 406 (1974), it does not take much for a police officer to establish a reasonable basis to justify an exit order or search based on safety concerns, and, if the basis is there, a court will uphold the order. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>413 Mass. 598, 600, 601 (1992) (driver put something inside his waistband after trying to evade police); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Almeida, </em>373 Mass. 266, 271-272 (1977) (driver failed to produce registration in high crime area, late at night, and carefully opened console just high enough when retrieving wallet); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Prevost, </em>44 Mass. App. Ct. 398, 399 (1998) (passenger bent out of officer\u2019s sight and attempted to put on his coat as if to conceal something); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Heughan, </em>40 Mass. App. Ct. 102, 104-105 (1996) (as driver pulled over, back seat passenger bent down as if replacing or retrieving object under front seat); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rivera, </em>33 Mass. App. Ct. 311, 314-315 (1992) (driver had no license, police officer outnumbered, aluminum bat under front passenger seat, back seat passenger holding object large enough to conceal weapon); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Vanderlinde, </em>27 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>Mass. App. Ct. 1103, 1104 (1989) (driver had tried to evade capture and passenger reached into well between the front seats during the stop). See also <em>State </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>134 N.J. 599, 618 (1994) (\u201cTo support an order to a passenger to alight from a vehicle stopped for a traffic violation, therefore, the officer need not point to specific facts that the occupants are \u2018armed and dangerous.\u2019 Rather, the officer need point only to some fact or facts in the totality of the circumstances that would create in a police officer a heightened awareness of danger that would warrant an objectively reasonable officer in securing the scene in a more effective manner by ordering the passenger to alight from the car\u201d). It could be argued plausibly that automatic exit orders might increase the chance of confrontation when already upset citizens are compelled to stand outside a vehicle while a police officer disposes of the minor traffic violation, especially if circumstances indicate that the officer\u2019s conduct may be a pretext.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b685-5\">The rule we adopt also provides that the police will act in a reasoned way. As Justice Kennedy stated in his dissent in <em>Wilson: </em>\u201cThe distinguishing feature of our criminal justice system is its insistence on principled, accountable decisionmaking in individual cases.\u201d <em>Maryland </em>v. <em>Wilson, supra </em>at 422 (Kennedy, J., dissenting). Bright-line rules, by their nature, tend to eliminate this feature. They should be allowed only in those circumstances where safety concerns clearly outweigh the intrusion on individual rights.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Police work is fast-paced, can be dangerous at times, and requires understanding of a broad set of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>rules in order to ensure that the rights of citizens are upheld. The dissent in this case calls for a bright-line rule in order to ease some of the complexity police officers face in the line of duty, equating the <em>Mimms-Wilson </em>rule to the automatic patfrisk that may accompany a lawful <em>Terry </em>stop.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>Post </em>at 676-678. The two situations are not analogous, and the difference between them demonstrates why the <em>Mimms-Wilson </em>rule should not be adopted.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-5\">Under <em>Terry, </em>a police officer is permitted to pat frisk a person stopped under suspicion of criminal activity where the police officer has reason to believe he is dealing with an armed and dangerous individual. See <em>Terry </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>392 U.S. 1, 24-25 (1968). Under <em>Mimms-Wilson, </em>a police officer is permitted to issue exit orders to a person stopped for a traffic infraction when the officer has no reason to suspect anything. It is more consistent with the <em>Terry </em>rule, as well as with the circumstances in which we have been willing to create bright-line rules, to require some objective circumstances making it reasonable to issue an exit order to the driver or passengers in a stopped vehicle. We believe that \u201c[i]t does no disservice to police officers .. . to insist upon exercise of reasoned judgment\u201d in this kind of case. <em>Maryland </em>v. <em>Wilson, supra </em>at 423 (Kennedy, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b686-6\">The dissent in this case refers to forty-five States which it asserts have accepted <em>Mimms </em>or <em>Wilson </em>or both. This assertion should be looked at with a skeptical eye. While we agree that twenty-two States have considered <em>Mimms, </em>and in some instances <em>Wilson, </em>and accepted the rules in these decisions as a matter of State constitutional law or policy,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> twenty-two States have not expressly considered the issues in <em>Mimms </em>or <em>Wilson </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>under their State Constitutions.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Three States have rejected <em>Mimms </em>or <em>Wilson </em>on State constitutional grounds.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark>,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b687-5\">We also point out other relevant considerations. The Declaration of Rights was adopted in 1780, as part of the Massachusetts Constitution, some seven years before the United States Constitution was approved. The Declaration of Rights was written in the historical context of the abuses of governmental power inflicted on the colonists by British officials, and art. 14 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>was directed at the unlawful invasion of privacy rights by those officials. That the drafters of the Fourth Amendment subsequently chose to replicate the words used in art. 14 cannot support a conclusion that we are compelled to act in lockstep with the United States Supreme Court when it interprets that amendment. Such a conclusion posits a serious misunderstanding of the authority of this court to interpret and enforce the various provisions of the Massachusetts Constitution, particularly those in the area of civil liberties. Chief Justice Wilkins has stated that, \u201cthe [United States] Supreme Court . . . describes] a common base from which we can go up,\u201d but the Justices of this court \u201care, however, entitled to [their] own views, indeed constitutionally required to have them.\u201d Remarks of Chief Justice Herbert P. Wilkins to Students at New England School of Law on March 27, 1997, 31 New England L. Rev. 1205, 1213 (1997). The nature of federalism requires that State Supreme Courts and State Constitutions be strong and independent repositories of authority in order to protect the rights of their citizens.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-5\">The foregoing discussion explains the foundation of our rule that, once a stopped driver has produced the necessary papers and they are found to be in order, he and his passengers are to be promptly released, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Torres, </em>424 Mass. 153, 158 (1997), and why we choose not to follow <em>Mimms-Wilson. </em>We, of course, respect the United States Supreme Court\u2019s judgment in the matter under the Fourth Amendment. That judgment was reached after balancing the interests of the police against the liberty interests of citizens, with the Court concluding that the former should prevail over the latter. For the reasons stated, we conclude that, under art. 14, the balancing of interests requires that Massachusetts citizens should not be subjected to unjustified exit orders during routine traffic stops.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-6\">3. We reject the Commonwealth\u2019s arguments that the judge based his ruling on an erroneous interpretation of the timing of the officer\u2019s exit orders, or, alternatively, that the judge erred in finding no reasonable basis for the actions of the trooper. It was not the timing of the trooper\u2019s actions, but the insufficient reasons for the actions, on which the judge based his decision. We agree with the analysis made by the Superior Court judge and the Appeals Court in considering whether the trooper had a basis to order the defendant out of the taxi. Where, as here, the evidence consists solely of oral testimony, the determination of the weight and credibility of the testimony is the responsibility <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>of the judge. We accept his subsidiary findings of fact and his decision that nervousness and fidgeting do not warrant what occurred here.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Colon-Cruz, </em>408 Mass. 533, 538 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b689-5\">\n<em>Order allowing motion to suppress affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b679-6\">In reaching this conclusion, the judge expressly relied on <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Torres, 424 Mass. 153, 158 (1997), which is based exclusively on art. 14 of the Declaration of Rights of the Massachusetts Constitution. The Commonwealth makes no argument that the defendant did not raise art. 14 as the only ground on which he could obtain the relief he sought in his motion to suppress.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b680-7\">In <em>Knowles </em>v. <em>Iowa, </em>119 S. Ct. 484 (1998), the United States Supreme Court appears to have drawn the line on what may be done by the police in a routine traffic stop.

Twenty-two years ago the Supreme Court of the United States announced a rule intended better to assure the safety of police officers against the sometimes lethal dangers of routine traffic stops. Today the court, invoking the Constitution of this State, rejects that rule. Virtually every other State has accepted the Supreme Court\u2019s rule. Indeed, until today we too had always cited the Supreme Court\u2019s rule with approval. Because I believe today\u2019s decision to be unwarranted in principle and unwise in policy, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b691-7\">In <em>Pennsylvania </em>v. <em>Mimms, </em>434 U.S. 106 (1977), the Supreme Court ruled that the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution is not offended by the practice of ordering, as a matter of course, the driver of a vehicle lawfully stopped to step outside the vehicle while the necessary inquiries connected with that stop are conducted. There were three dissenters at that time. The Court has not deviated from that rule. Two years ago in <em>Maryland </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>519 U.S. 408 (1997), a wide spectrum of Justices (Rehnquist, C.J., and O\u2019Connor, Scalia, Thomas, Souter, Ginsburg, and Breyer, JJ.) extended that rule to the passenger of the vehicle. There were only two dissenters. The Court\u2019s reasoning in <em>Mimms </em>is worth setting out at length:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b691-8\">\u201cThe State freely concedes the officer had no reason to suspect foul play from the particular driver at the time of the stop, there having been nothing unusual or suspicious about his behavior. It was apparently his practice to order all drivers out of their vehicles as a matter of course whenever they had been stopped for a traffic violation. The State argues that this practice was adopted as a precautionary measure to afford a degree of protection to the officer and that it may be justified on that ground. Establishing a face-to-face confrontation diminishes the possibility, otherwise substantial, that the driver can make unobserved movements; this, in turn, reduces the likelihood that the officer will be the victim of an assault.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b691-9\">\u201cWe think it too plain for argument that the State\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>proffered justification \u2014 the safety of the officer \u2014 is both legitimate and weighty. \u2018Certainly it would be unreasonable to require that police officers take unnecessary risks in the performance of their duties.\u2019 <em>Terry </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>[392 U.S. 1, 23 (1968)]. And we have specifically recognized the inordinate risk confronting an officer as he approaches a person seated in an automobile. \u2018According to one study, approximately 30% of police shootings occurred when a police officer approached a suspect seated in an automobile. Bristow, Police Officer Shootings \u2014 A Tactical Evaluation, 54 J. Crim. L.C. &amp; P.S. 93 (1963).\u2019 <em>Adams </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>407 U.S. 143, 148 n.3 (1972). We are aware that not all these assaults occur when issuing traffic summons, but we have before expressly declined to accept the argument that traffic violations necessarily involve less danger to officers than other types of confrontations. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>414 U.S. 218, 234 (1973). Indeed, it appears \u2018that a significant percentage of murders of police officers occurs when the officers are making traffic stops.\u2019 <em>Id., </em>at 234, n.5.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b692-5\">\u201cThe hazard of accidental injury from passing traffic to an officer standing on the driver\u2019s side of the vehicle may also be appreciable in some situations. Rather than conversing while standing exposed to moving traffic, the officer prudently may prefer to ask the driver of the vehicle to step out of the car and off onto the shoulder of the road where the inquiry may be pursued with greater safety to both.\u201d (Footnote omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b692-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 109-111. In extending that rule to passengers in <em>Wilson, </em>the Court stated that \u201cdanger to an officer from a traffic stop is likely to be greater when there are passengers in addition to the driver in the stopped car. While there is not the same basis for ordering the passengers out of the car as there is for ordering the driver out, the additional intrusion on the passenger is minimal.\u201d <em>Wilson, supra </em>at 414-415. One cannot insist too much on the statistics cited by the Court showing the number of fatal killings of police officers in connection with traffic stops, including routine traffic stops. Since <em>Mimms </em>was decided, at least two police officers in this Commonwealth have been murdered in connection with traffic stops. See <em>Boston Herald </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>421 Mass. 502 (1995); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number><em>Colon-Cruz, </em>408 Mass. 533 (1990).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The court today waves aside the substantial evidence of this mortal danger to our law enforcement officers with only a passing reference to the \u201cdanger for a police officer inherent in any auto stop,\u201d <em>ante </em>at 664, quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>46 Mass. App. Ct. 181, 183 (1999), and rejects for the first time a doctrine we have cited with approval ever since it was first established.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-5\">n</p>\n<p id=\"b693-6\">The court finds this rejection of the Supreme Court\u2019s Fourth Amendment jurisprudence to be compelled by the similarly worded provision of art. 14 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights, a provision we have never before cited in this context. There is no such constitutional compulsion. This is a pure judgment of policy, a policy judgment that appeals to a majority of this court, though not to the United States Supreme Court. In the past, when we have declined to follow the Supreme Court in this area of the law, we have pointed to decisions in our <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>sister States to show that ours is not an idiosyncratic or merely personal judgment. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Stoute, </em>422 Mass. 782, 786-789 (1996) (declining to follow <em>California </em>v. <em>Hodari D., </em>499 U.S. 621 [1991]); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Upton, </em>394 Mass. 363, 374 n.10 (1985) (declining to follow <em>Illinois </em>v. <em>Gates, </em>463 U.S. 213 [1983]). The court does not do so today, and small wonder. Forty-four States and the District of Columbia have accepted <em>Mimms </em>and only one has rejected it on constitutional grounds, as the court does today.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> See Appendix.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>And of the twenty-nine jurisdictions to consider whether to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number>extend <em>Mimms </em>to passengers, only three have declined, and, of these three, two were decided prior to <em>Wilson, </em>seriously undermining any claim as to their continuing validity. See Appendix. Indeed, it is significant that the one State court decision to which the court does point and from which it quotes at length, <em>State </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>134 N.J. 599 (1994), explicitly endorsed <em>Mimms, </em>but declined to extend it to passengers. <em>Id. </em>at 617-619. Moreover, that case was decided before <em>Wilson. </em>And since <em>Wilson </em>two New Jersey courts have questioned the continuing validity of <em>Smith. </em>See <em>State </em>v. <em>Arthur, </em>149 N.J. 1, 16 (1997) (discussing both <em>Mimms </em>and <em>Wilson </em>and noting that <em>Smith </em>was \u201cprior to <em>Wilson\u2018); In re A.P., </em>315 N.J. Super. 166, 169-171 (1998) (discussing with approval both <em>Mimms </em>and <em>Wilson </em>and distinguishing permissibility of exit order while performing community caretaking function from <em>Mimms-Wilson </em>rule applicable to lawful traffic stops).</p>\n<p id=\"b696-5\">The Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Mimms<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> explained in some detail why ordering a lawfully stopped motorist to leave his vehicle might be a reasonable safety precaution. Measured against the danger to the officer, the Court judged that the inconvenience to the motorist was minimal. As I have said, the court today makes only the most passing reference to these compelling facts. But <em>Mimms </em>and <em>Wilson </em>represent a more general judgment than that regarding the relative weight of the interests of the police and the stopped motorist. The Supreme Court is deliberately promulgating a simple bright-line rule, which police officers and judges can readily understand and administer. This is in response to a widespread sentiment that Fourth Amendment law had become far too complex, replete with many factored tests and complex balancing of factors.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Such complexity is particularly inappropriate in an area of law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>which is to be administered by police officers in the field, often in dangerous and confused circumstances. <em>Mimms </em>and <em>Wilson </em>are but two examples of the Supreme Court\u2019s attempt to make the law of searches and seizures more appropriate to the circumstances to which it applies.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The virtue of <em>Mimms </em>and <em>Wilson </em>is that they do not require the officers to weigh up the factors and circumstances before taking one simple step to increase their own safety. <em>Mimms </em>and <em>Wilson </em>would also take judges out of the business of making similar fine-grained inquiries after the fact in order to determine whether the police\u2019s self-protective measures were justified. Rather, there is substituted a global judgment and a simple, bright-line rule. The recent decision of the Supreme Court in <em>Knowles </em>v. <em>Iowa, </em>119 S. Ct. 484 (1998), to which the court adverts, is entirely consistent with this development. <em>Mimms </em>and <em>Wilson </em>establish what may be done in a proper traffic stop, and <em>Knowles </em>makes clear that when the reason for the stop has been exhausted, so is the basis for the self-protective and other measures. And that is all that our many cases \u2014 <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Torres, </em>424 Mass. 153 (1997); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Loughlin, </em>385 Mass. 60 (1982); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ferrara, </em>376 Mass. 502 (1978) \u2014 which the court today cites for its decision hold, as the court\u2019s own parentheticals show.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The Supreme Court\u2019s pursuit of bright-line rules that would avoid what the Court called a \u201cbog of litigation\u201d was again illustrated in the very recent case of <em>Wyoming </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>v. <em>Houghton, </em>119 S. Ct. 1297, 1303 (1999), where the Court refused to condemn the search of the handbag of a passenger in an automobile the police reasonably believed contained contraband, without any particularized belief relative to that handbag or that passenger. See <em>id. </em>at 1304 (Breyer, J., concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b698-5\">Of course there is a balancing of competing interests in these decisions, but what the court misses today is what might be called the second-order balancing that weighs the advantages of a myriad of complex individual determinations against the clarity of a readily understood and readily administered bright-line rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-6\">HI</p>\n<p id=\"b698-7\">Now what does the court offer as a basis for rejecting the balance struck in a long line of Supreme Court decisions,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and by virtually all of our sister States? See Appendix. Certainly not our precedents, because we have consistently cited <em>Mimms </em>with approval, although sometimes tacking on language which misreads what is the salient and evident holding of that case. In the light of these many citations, the opening flourish in the court\u2019s analysis of our cases, \u201cWe have not adopted Mimms,\u201d is somewhat surprising. <em>Ante </em>at 661. Moreover, we have never once until this day invoked art. 14 in respect to exit orders, and therefore whether we have misread <em>Mimms </em>or not,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> we were certainly bound by it in applying the Fourth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-8\">No, this is pure policy. And what is the basis for this policy? That the intrusions on operators and passengers are not so minimal as the Supreme Court and almost every other State <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>court think,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and that the police officers may after all get all the protection they need, because \u201cit does not take much for a police officer to establish a reasonable basis to justify an exit order.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 664. But that is just the point: it does not take much because the danger is ever present and therefore both police officers and the administration of justice are better served by the Supreme Court\u2019s bright-line rule. In this respect, the bright-line <em>Mimms-Wilson </em>rule is analogous to the patfnsk that may accompany a lawful <em>Terry </em>stop. See <em>Terry </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>392 U.S. 1, 24-25 (1968). As in the traffic stop, the initial intrusion does require some demonstrable predicate, but neither the Supreme Court nor this court has ever demanded that an officer conducting a patfnsk must \u2014 to use the court\u2019s phrasing today \u2014 \u201cestablish a reasonable basis\u201d for the protective measure. If the stop is lawful, this further minor intrusion is entirely within the officer\u2019s discretion. See <em>Terry, supra </em>at 30; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fraser, </em>410 Mass. 541, 544-545 n.4 (1991), quoting 3 W.R. LaFave, Search and Seizure \u00a7 9.4(a), at 499 (2d ed. 1987 &amp; Supp. 1991) (\u201cA protective frisk of a suspect under the principles of <em>Terry </em>may be warranted where there is \u2018some legitimate basis for the officer being in immediate proximity to the person\u2019 \u201d). The reason is the same here: to ask more is to put the officer in danger for insufficient reason.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-5\">Unfortunately the court chooses to bolster its policy judgment by invoking the inflammatory issue of race: \u201cRoutine traffic stops may also pose unique hardships on minorities who, it has been argued, are often the subject of stops on pretext.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 663. What work is the word \u201cpretext\u201d doing here? Is the traffic stop justified, or is it not? If it is not, then of course it constitutes an unlawful seizure and resulting searches are also unlawful. What the court must mean is that the traffic stop is lawful, but the discretion to make the stop is invoked discriminatorily against minorities, as the materials cited by the court and the concurrence clearly indicate. And that discriminatory imposition may then be the occasion for imposing, in a discriminatory way, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>the further humiliation that the court discerns in police exit orders. Although I completely agree that the discriminatory enforcement of the law is a shame and a disgrace, as Professor Randall Kennedy has so eloquently argued, see Kennedy, Race, Crime, and the Law c. 4 (1997), I think it is fanciful to imagine that by weaving a gossamer garment of complicated rules, we will do anything at all to root out this behavior wherever it exists. Does not the court seek to justify this very decision by arguing that \u201cit does not take much for a police officer to establish a reasonable basis to justify an exit order?\u201d Surely bigoted or abusive police officers, bent on mischief, will have no difficulty at all in concocting such a \u201creasonable basis\u201d after the fact. It is a fundamental error to fashion rules that will hamper only conscientious officers in order to restrain the unconscientious and abusive, who in any event will evade them. The conscientious officer who follows the court\u2019s ruling today must hesitate in order to ponder whether he has that \u201cobjective\u201d and \u201carticulable\u201d basis for ordering a driver or his passenger out of a lawfully stopped vehicle. That moment\u2019s hesitation may cost him his life. That is what the Supreme Court concluded a long time ago and that is the judgment to which it has adhered ever since. The unscrupulous officer will do as he pleases and find his justification afterward.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-5\">So it comes down to two policy judgments: that of the Supreme Court and of almost all other State courts, or the one this court promulgates today in the name of our State Constitution. I prefer the Supreme Court\u2019s judgment and the judgment of State courts across the nation. May not the majority of this court prefer its own? Is there no principle of choice, no metric of judgment here? This is an utterly false dilemma, and the maxim, in dubiis libertas, cuts sharply against what the court does today. For the Supreme Court\u2019s rule leaves the Legislatures of this nation \u2014 which, after all, have the mandate, the experience, and the means to make policy judgments \u2014 free to enact more stringent measures if they deem it appropriate. This court\u2019s action today removes that option from the Legislature. Our Legislature has, on several occasions, enacted procedural protections against police practices more stringent than we were prepared to impose in the name of the Constitution. Even now, as the court\u2019s and the concurring opinion\u2019s citations indicate, the problem of discriminatory enforcement of traffic laws has caught the attention of our and other State Legislatures and State and Federal executive policy makers. Quite apart from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>greater legitimacy of policy making by the Legislature, the Legislature has the means to gather the facts, to develop structured remedial systems, and the ability to reverse course if it makes a mistake. When we speak in the name of the Constitution, however, we purport to speak for the ages and, absent a change of heart, only a constitutional amendment can reverse a mistaken course of decision. But the technical and particularistic nature of today\u2019s mistaken decision does not allow even that cumbersome remedy, and the people of the Commonwealth must rely entirely on this court\u2019s wisdom and restraint. Cf. <em>District Attorney for the Suffolk Dist. </em>v. <em>Watson, </em>381 Mass. 648 (1980) (death penalty violates State Constitution), overturned by die 1982 amendment (art. 116 of the Amendments) to art. 26 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b701-6\">Finally, I must respond to the court\u2019s invocation of history to justify, maybe even to compel, its unwise and idiosyncratic decision. This is the argument that John Adams made me do it. Of course we have a duty to come to our own conclusion about the meaning of our own Constitution, and no one asserts otherwise. This is particularly so if the wording of our Declaration of Rights is more stringent than that of the Bill of Rights. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Amirault, </em>424 Mass. 618, 628-631 (1997); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hinckley, </em>422 Mass. 261 (1996). In this case the two formulations are, in all relevant respects, identical. Of course even then \u201cwe can go up,\u201d and place greater restrictions on law enforcement than the Supreme Court has decreed. This is a truism. We are not free to go down, so \u201cup\u201d is the only direction in which we may move, but that proves nothing. The directional metaphor of \u201cup\u201d suggests that more is necessarily better, as are more parks, more teachers, more safety, and more security. But that begs the central question. Are more and more restrictions on law enforcement, more and more elaborate rules better; is that trend really \u201cup?\u201d Thus, rather than engaging in judicial chauvinism we should ask: Is this decision wise, and \u2014 far more to the point \u2014 is there something in our Constitution that authorizes us to announce this anomalous rule and, by styling it a constitutional judgment, to put it beyond the reach of the ordinary processes of government? There is not.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-7\">As for history, research shows that many of the complexities we have thrown up about the process of investigating, prosecut<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>ing and punishing crime were far from the contemplation of those who framed either the Bill of Rights or our own Declaration of Rights. See Amar, The Fourth Amendment, Boston, and the Writs of Assistance, 30 Suffolk U. L. Rev. 53 (1996); Amar, Fourth Amendment First Principles, 107 Harv. L. Rev. 757 (1994); Langbein, The Historical Origins of the Privilege Against Self-Incrimination at Common Law, 92 Mich. L. Rev. 1047 (1994). These and other restrictions are of more recent vintage, based in large part on a series of warmly contested decisions of the United States Supreme Court primarily during the decade of the 1960\u2019s. See, e.g., <em>Furman </em>v. <em>Georgia, </em>408 U.S. 238, 257 (1972) (Brennan, 1, concurring) (death penalty violates Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution); <em>Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436 (1966); <em>Griffin </em>v. <em>California, </em>380 U.S. 609 (1965); <em>Mapp </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>367 U.S. 643 (1961). And as for the integrity of our distinct constitutional traditions, the striking thing is that, often as not, these Supreme Court decisions compelled us to abandon long-standing lines of decision interpreting our Declaration of Rights. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Tibbetts, </em>157 Mass. 519 (1893); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dana, </em>2 Met. 329 (1841). Cf. Cassell, The Mysterious Creation of Search and Seizure Exclusionary Rules under State Constitutions: The Utah Experience, 1993 Utah L. Rev. 751. That is why the invocation of our own independent traditions on this, as on other occasions, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Stoute, </em>422 Mass. 782, 786-787 (1996) (declining to follow <em>California </em>v. <em>Hodari D., </em>499 U.S. 621 [1991]); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lyons, </em>409 Mass. 16, 18 (1990), and <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Upton, </em>394 Mass. 363, 371 (1985) (declining to follow <em>Illinois </em>v. <em>Gates, </em>462 U.S. 213 [1983] [totality of the circumstances in determining reasonable suspicion and probable cause]); <em>District Attorney for the Suffolk Dist. </em>v. <em>Watson, supra </em>at 666-667 (declining to follow <em>Gregg </em>v. <em>Georgia, </em>428 U.S. 153 [1976]), is more than a little opportunistic. What in fact has happened is that after the brief burst of activity in the Supreme Court, the Court itself calmed down and declined, in a series of decisions of which <em>Mimms </em>and <em>Wilson </em>are but two, to extend the doctrines of that brief earlier period. That more sober trend, of course, invoked the strong disapproval of the dwindling number of Justices who in dissent would have extrapolated from the sometimes salutary positions marked out in the earlier decade. And sensing defeat, the call went out for State courts to take up the work in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>name of their own State Constitutions. Brennan, State Constitutions and the Protection of Individual Rights, 90 Harv. L. Rev. 489 (1977).

(See, e.g., UPI News Service, May 9, 1985.) The court\u2019s emphasis on the location of the shooters misses the point of the <em>Mimms-Wilson </em>line of cases. <em>Mimms </em>and <em>Wilson </em>are not so much about in or out being better (although, as both cases involved exit orders, the court did explain the potential benefits which would animate such an order on the part of the officer), they are about assuring that officers have the ability to take protective measures which amount to only a de minimis intrusion on the occupants\u2019 liberty \u2014 namely deciding where the officer would prefer the occupants wait \u2014 in order to minimize the threat to the officer during these potentially dangerous encounters. I cite to the cases in the accompanying text merely to indicate how real this danger is here in the Commonwealth.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-8\">Courts across the nation have realized that the purpose of <em>Mimms </em>and <em>Wilson </em>is not for courts to decide whether having occupants wait inside or outside the vehicle is safer, rather, it is to allow the experienced officer in the field to make this determination in the particular circumstances present. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Webster, </em>170 Ariz. 372, 373-374 (Ct. App. 1992) (holding that <em>Mimms </em>rule applies equally to both drivers and passengers and even encompasses further order to get back into car); <em>Borski </em>v. <em>State, </em>712 So. 2d 787, 788 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 1998) (approving of <em>Mimms-Wilson </em>rule and holding the rule extends to orders to driver or passenger to remain in the vehicle); <em>State </em>v. <em>Roberts, </em>284 Mont. 54 (1997) (citing <em>Wilson, </em>holding that an officer, who stopped automobile because he believed arrest warrant existed for driver, did not unlawfully detain passenger by directing him to remain in the vehicle). That the protective measure may sometimes prove insufficient, or even that it may backfire, does not detract from the need to allow the officer in the field the ability to make this determination free from the fear that his actions will later be second-guessed by some court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b694-5\">The Supreme Court of Oregon has not ruled on this issue but the Oregon Court of Appeals appears to have rejected the <em>Mimms </em>rule on statutory grounds. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Lanig, </em>154 Or. App. 665, 667-668 (1998) (citing Or. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 810.401[3][b] [1997], which has been construed to limit the course of police action during a stop for a traffic infraction). Not only does this dissent urge that the question be one for legislative determination, but the court\u2019s opinion here today preempts such determinations. Moreover, the existence of such a law indicates a belief that, were it not for the law, the contested police action would be permissible under the State as well as the Federal Constitution. See Appendix. Three States have not ruled on the issue. <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b694-11\">Much of the materials the court cites to draw the teeth of my demonstration that the step it takes today is at odds with the prevailing law across the nation, are either dubiously characterized or beside the point. The court gives some importance to the fact that some of the States that have followed <em>Mimms </em>or <em>Wilson </em>\u201chave not expressly considered the issues in <em>Mimms </em>or <em>Wilson </em>under their State Constitutions.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 666-667. The contention that the absence of an explicit reference to a provision of the State Constitution indicates a failure of these courts to consider that issue is unconvincing. Both the courts and the defense bar are aware of the existence of State Constitutions and it is unreasonable to suggest that motions to suppress are regularly denied where the State Constitution would require a different result. Even where the State Constitution is not explicitly mentioned, courts often use broad and inclusive language that does not indicate that the decisions are solely contemplating the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Reynolds, </em>753 S.W.2d 1, 2 (Mo. Ct. App. 1988) (denying motion which \u201calleges that the trial court committed error when it overruled his motion to suppress,\u201d because \u201c[o]nce a vehicle is lawfully detained for a traffic violation, a police officer may order the occupants to get out of the vehicle\u201d). Moreover, there is evidence that, even where a majority opinion does not make explicit reference to the State Constitution, the issue is usually brought to the court\u2019s attention, just not successfully. <em>State </em>v. <em>Ferrise, </em>269 N.W.2d 888, 890, 891 &amp; n.1 (Minn. 1978) (where court extended <em>Mimms </em>rule to passengers <em>pre-Wilson </em>and dissent argued that there was not \u201cthe ample probable cause in this case which is required by the constitutions of both the United States and the State of Minnesota,\u201d citing art. 1, \u00a7 10, of the Minnesota Constitution); <em>State </em>v. <em>Stubbs, </em>270 Mont. 364, 369, 375 (1995) (Trieweiler, J., dissenting) (where court cited <em>Mimms </em>with approval and dissent argued that the result did not square with \u201ceither the Fourth. Amendment to the United States Constitution or Article II, Section 11, of the Montana <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>Constitution\u201d); <em>State </em>v. <em>Houghton, </em>956 P.2d 363, 366 n.2 (Wyo. 1998), rev\u2019d, 119 S. Ct. 1297 (1999) (not taking issue with automatic exit order despite explaining that art. 1, \u00a7 4, of the Wyoming Constitution is \u201csomewhat stronger than its federal counterpart\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b695-6\">Equally misleading is the court\u2019s claim that \u201c[t]hree States have rejected <em>Mimms </em>or <em>Wilson </em>on State constitutional grounds.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 667. In fact, only one other court in the entire nation has done what this court does here today. <em>State </em>v. <em>Kim, </em>68 Haw. 286, 287-288 (1985), rejected <em>Mimms </em>and Hawaii has not given any indication, nor is it likely to, that it would come to a different conclusion regarding passengers in light of <em>Wilson. </em>The court claims that Vermont appears not to follow <em>Mimms. Ante </em>at 667 n.9. But the Vermont cases the court cites cite <em>Mimms </em>and do not anywhere disavow its holding. In <em>State </em>v. <em>Jewett, </em>148 Vt. 324, 329 (1987), the court was explicitly asked to hold that, \u201cunder Chapter I, Article Eleven of the Vermont Constitution police officers may . . . require the suspect to leave his vehicle only if they reasonably suspect the person is armed and dangerous.\u201d The court declined to announce any such rule and upheld the exit order and subsequent search. The court found that there was, indeed, probable cause to search the suspect, obviating the need for the court to choose which standard, prosecution\u2019s or defense\u2019s, to apply as either was met. <em>Id. </em>at 330. Cf. <em>State </em>v. <em>Caron, </em>155 Vt. 492, 501 (1990). It is also a stretch for the court to cite the Supreme Court of Washington in support of today\u2019s holding for, while that court has, indeed, rejected <em>Wilson, </em>it has explicitly accepted <em>Mimms </em>which the court today also rejects. <em>State </em>v. <em>Mendez, </em>137 Wash. 2d 208, 220 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b695-7\">The court similarly attempts to manufacture indecision where none exists. The court claims that the situation in Michigan is \u201cunclear.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 667 n.10. The only basis for such a contention is a case in which an appeals court reversed itself on reconsideration after initially holding that the Michigan Constitution provided greater rights than that afforded by the Supreme Court decision in <em>Mimms. People </em>v. <em>Harmelin, </em>176 Mich. App. 524, 527 (1989), aff\u2019d, 501 U.S. 957 (1991). But even in its earlier opinion, the court in that case admitted that \u201cother panels of this Court have cited <em>Mimms </em>with approbation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 530. In fact, both the Supreme Court of Michigan, <em>People </em>v. <em>Bloyd, </em>416 Mich. 538, 552 (1982) (accepting <em>Mimms </em>standard describing being told to stand outside a car as opposed to sitting in the car as \u201ca permissible de minimis intrusion\u201d), and several appeals panels, before and since, have done so. <em>People </em>v. <em>Martinez, </em>187 Mich. App. 160, 165-166 (1991) (extending <em>Mimms </em>to passengers <em>prt-Wilson); People </em>v. <em>Laube, </em>154 Mich. App. 400, 408-410 (1986); <em>People </em>v. <em>Blackburne, </em>150 Mich. App. 156, 164-165 (1986). Further, on reconsideration, the panel in <em>Hamelin, supra </em>at 531, held that the evidence in that case was wrongly suppressed because the search and seizure provision in the Michigan State Constitution provides that it \u201cshall not be construed to bar from evidence in any criminal proceeding, any narcotic drug, firearm, bomb, explosive or any other dangerous weapon, seized by a peace officer outside the curtilage of any dwelling house in this state.\u201d Art. 1, \u00a7 11, of the Michigan Constitution. As the evidence Gonsalves seeks to have suppressed in this case is cocaine and it was seized outside the home, even this outlier of a case cited by the court would support a result different from that reached by the majority today.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b696-6\">The court today characterizes <em>Pennsylvania </em>v. <em>Mimms, </em>434 U.S. 106 (1977), as the abandonment of some prior rule akin to that which it today proclaims and to which it suggests the Supreme Court used to adhere until somehow it went astray. But <em>Mimms </em>overruled no precedent. The court, therefore, does not here hold fast to some great tradition, while the Supreme Court loses its way.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b696-8\">See Sklansky, Traffic Stops, Minority Motorists, and the Future of the Fourth Amendment, 1997 Sup.

In that case a judicial officer makes the decision to dispense with the knock and announce requirement at the same hearing at which he determines whether a warrant should issue at all. There is, in the context of that process, none of the need for a split-second intuitive judgment to engage in a protective measure as there is here and in a <em>Terry </em>stop.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b697-6\">The majority opinion cites numerous cases from this court and the Appeals Court as examples of protections guaranteed by art. 14 that \u201cmay not be recognized under the Fourth Amendment.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 662. In fact, each and every one of the examples given is entirely consistent with Fourth Amendment requirements. These cases simply stand for the proposition that, in order to extend a stop beyond the time necessary to complete the purpose for which the stop was made, the police must have probable cause. This is required by the Fourth Amendment. See <em>Knowles, supra. </em>The <em>Mimms-Wilson </em>doctrine does not authorize extended detention or any search without probable cause. It simply allows the officer, for his own .safety, to have the occupants of a vehicle wait outside the vehicle, where their actions can be observed, rather <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>than inside the vehicle, where they cannot.</p>\n<p id=\"Agh\">It should only be added that when our cases speak of the production of a \u201cvalid\u201d license and registration as terminating the officer\u2019s grounds for further detaining a motorist, this must include the time it takes to check by radio or computer whether the documents produced are indeed valid.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b698-14\">See Sklansky, <em>supra </em>at 282-291.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b698-15\">The court relies on \u201cthe principles expressed in the <em>Santana </em>decision.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 662.

Our decision in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Torres, </em>424 Mass. 153 (1997), which is the sole reference to art. 14 cited by the majority, invokes art. 14 not in this context but in respect to the continued detention of the subject of a routine traffic stop after the purpose of the stop had been effectuated.

The <em>Mimms-Wilson </em>rule is mindful of this concern. The Fourth Amendment does require that the stop not be extended in duration without probable cause. The <em>Mimms-Wilson </em>rule does not allow officers to extend the duration of a lawful stop but only to determine where the occupants wait for the time necessary to effectuate the purpose for which the stop was made.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
