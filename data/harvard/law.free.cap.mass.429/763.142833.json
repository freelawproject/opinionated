Additionally, he requests that we exercise our power under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E, to reduce his conviction or to set aside the verdict.

L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-5\"><em>Facts. </em>We summarize the evidence construed in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth. The victim was twelve years old at the time of the murder. On the night of April 14, 1993, the victim\u2019s mother worked the night shift and arranged for the defendant to babysit.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-6\">The defendant was playing cards with the victim in the victim\u2019s bedroom. The defendant told the victim that he was going to kill her mother because she had given him AIDS. The victim told the defendant that she was going to tell her mother. The defendant went to the kitchen, picked up a kitchen knife, and returned to the victim\u2019s bedroom where, he proceeded to rape her. He then stabbed the victim four times in the head and neck with the kitchen knife. The victim did not die immediately and began screaming. The defendant then suffocated the victim by shoving his fingers down her throat. After the victim was dead, he placed her body in a bedroom closet. The following day the victim\u2019s body was discovered in the closet.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-7\">An autopsy revealed that the cause of death was either strangulation, suffocation, or a combination of the two. The doctor who performed the autopsy believed that the victim had suffered for twenty to thirty minutes before she died. There was also evidence that the victim\u2019s vagina had been penetrated.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-8\"><em>The defendant\u2019s statements. </em>The defendant moved to suppress statements he made claiming that he was under the influence of drugs during the first police interview, and that he was experiencing drug withdrawal during the second police interview. After a hearing on the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress, the motion judge denied the motion and made the follow<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"765\">*765</page-number>ing findings. On April 16, 1993, two State police officers, Trooper Francis Leahy and Trooper Dagoberto Martin Driggs, were assigned to investigate the case and went to the victim\u2019s mother\u2019s apartment where they saw the victim\u2019s body in the closet of the back bedroom. The police officers received information that the defendant had been with the victim on the night of April 14 through April 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-5\">Shortly after 10 p.m., the defendant was first questioned by Trooper Driggs and Trooper Leahy at the State police barracks in Leominster. Both the defendant and Trooper Driggs speak Spanish as their primary language. At the beginning of the interview, the officers informed the defendant who they were and what the purpose of the interview was. Trooper Driggs advised the defendant fully of his Miranda rights, both in Spanish and English. The defendant acknowledged, both in Spanish and English, that he understood his rights and did not request an attorney. At first, the defendant denied being with the victim during the approximate time of the murder. The defendant changed his story, however, when Trooper Driggs informed him in Spanish that a number of witnesses told the officers that the defendant had been with the victim on the night of her death. The defendant then admitted that he had stabbed and strangled the victim because he was angry with her mother. After a series of questions, some of the questions and responses were reduced to writing in English.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b785-6\">At the end of the interview, Trooper Driggs went over the entire statement with the defendant in both English and Span<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"766\">*766</page-number>ish. The defendant read the statement out loud in English, indicated it was correct, and signed various parts of the statement. Throughout the interview the defendant was not restrained and he appeared to be normal. There was no indication of the defendant being under the influence of alcohol or drugs. After the interview, the defendant was taken into custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-5\">On April 18, 1993, in response to the defendant\u2019s request, Trooper Driggs went to the Worcester County house of correction and spoke with the defendant again. Again, the defendant was advised of his Miranda rights. During the second interview, the defendant stated that he was angry with the victim\u2019s mother because she had given him AIDS, and described in detail how <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"767\">*767</page-number>he shoved his fingers down the victim\u2019s throat and suffocated her for twenty to thirty minutes. This statement was also reduced to writing.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b788-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"768\">*768</page-number>At trial, Trooper Driggs read the defendant\u2019s confessions to the jury. The defendant testified on his own behalf. The theory of the defense was that the defendant had falsely confessed to the murder as part of an agreement with the victim\u2019s mother because he had AIDS and wanted the victim\u2019s mother to take care of his son when he died.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-5\">1. <em>The voluntariness of the statements. </em>The defendant claims that the trial judge\u2019s failure to give a \u201chumane practice\u201d instruction, sua sponte, created a substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice. The defendant concedes that his drug use or drug withdrawal was not directly argued at trial, but claims that testimony at trial concerning his drug use and withdrawal during the period preceding his arrest and confessions made the voluntariness of his confessions a \u201clive issue.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b789-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"769\">*769</page-number>We conclude that the issue of voluntariness was insufficiently raised to require the judge to give a humane practice instruction. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Tavares, </em>385 Mass. 140, 150, cert. denied, 457 U.S. 1137 (1982), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Alicea, </em>376 Mass. 506, 523 (1978) (judge has no obligation to instruct jury on issue of voluntariness \u201cunless it is made a live issue at trial\u201d). The defense did not focus on involuntariness. On the contrary, the focus of the defense was that the defendant intentionally confessed to the murder as part of an agreement with the victim\u2019s mother. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brady, </em>380 Mass. 44, 51 (1980) (where defendant claimed voluntariness issue was raised because of evidence that he had been drinking, issue not live where focus of defense was alibi and evidence of intoxication not substantial). A claim of involuntariness would have contradicted the defendant\u2019s theory of defense. In fact, the mere assertion that the defendant contrived the entire story, provided specific details of how the victim was murdered, and related these events in a coherent rational manner is inconsistent with the claim that his confessions were involuntary because of drug or alcohol intoxication. For the jury to accept his explanation for his confessions requires the belief that the defendant knew what he was doing. Indeed, the defendant testified at trial that he had lied in order to confuse the officer. He also testified that he is \u201cin control\u201d when he is on drugs. Moreover, evidence of drug use or withdrawal alone does not render an otherwise valid confession involuntary. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Paszko, </em>391 Mass. 164, 176 (1984); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fielding, </em>371 Mass. 97, 112 (1976). While there was evidence of the defendant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"770\">*770</page-number>drug dependency and possible drug withdrawal, we conclude that the issue of voluntariness was not \u201craised with sufficient point to require an express admonition to the jury by the Court [on its own motion].\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brady, supra </em>at 55, quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pratt, </em>360 Mass. 708, 714-715 (1972). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>371 Mass. 462, 471 n.3 (1976) (under humane practice doctrine, jury reconsideration is required whenever <em>credible </em>evidence of involuntariness is put before jury). In these circumstances, there was no substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice despite the judge\u2019s failure to give a humane practice instruction, sua sponte, because the judge was not obligated to do so. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Burke, </em>414 Mass. 252, 259-260 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b790-5\">2. <em>Denial of the motion for a new trial. </em>The defendant argues that the judge abused her discretion by denying his motion for a new trial based on ineffective assistance of counsel. The defendant claims that his trial counsel failed aggressively to pursue the issue of the defendant\u2019s drug use and drug withdrawal as it concerned the voluntariness of his confessions, by refusing to let him testify, and by waiving oral argument at the suppression hearing. He contends that this decision deprived him of a substantial ground of defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-6\">The decision to allow a motion for a new trial lies within the sound discretion of the judge and will not be reversed unless it is manifestly unjust or unless the trial was infected with prejudicial constitutional error. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hung Tan Vo, </em>427 Mass. 464, 467 (1998), citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Figueroa, </em>422 Mass. 72, 77 (1996); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Russin, </em>420 Mass. 309, 318 (1995). Here, because the defendant was convicted of murder in the first degree, we review these allegations under the substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice standard required by G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E, a standard more favorable to a defendant than is the constitutional standard for determining ineffective assistance of counsel. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mitchell, </em>428 Mass. 852, 854 (1999). Under that standard of review, we need not focus on the adequacy of trial counsel\u2019s performance, but rather examine \u201cwhether there was an error . . . (by defense counsel, the prosecutor, or the judge) and, if there was, whether that error was likely to have influenced the jury\u2019s conclusion.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mello, </em>420 Mass. 375, 393 (1995), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wright, </em>411 Mass. 678, 682 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b791-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"771\">*771</page-number>At the hearing on his motion for a new trial, the judge rejected the defendant\u2019s contention that his trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance in his decision not to let the defendant testify at the suppression hearing. The judge found that defense counsel\u2019s explanation that he did not want to open the defendant up to impeachment at trial and did not want to reveal the defense strategy by allowing the defendant to testify at the suppression hearing was not unreasonable.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The motion judge was also the trial judge and her conclusion is entitled to special deference. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Figueroa, supra, </em>citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dascalakis, </em>246 Mass. 12, 32-33 (1923). We agree with the judge\u2019s conclusion and find no error. Moreover, trial counsel\u2019s waiver of oral argument at the conclusion of the hearing on the new trial motion was not manifestly unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-5\">3. <em>Ineffective assistance of counsel. </em>The defendant further argues that his trial counsel was ineffective in failing to request a humane practice instruction, in abandoning at trial the issue of voluntariness of the defendant\u2019s confessions, and in his closing argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-6\">Because we have concluded that a humane practice instruction was not required and would have been inconsistent with the theory of the defense, his arguments in regard to his confessions are unavailing. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wright, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b791-7\">The defendant also contends that his trial counsel\u2019s comments created a substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice because he contends they could have caused the jury to ignore the judge\u2019s instructions, particularly concerning the burden of proof and the presumption of innocence. He points to defense counsel\u2019s preliminary comments at the start of his summation, where he stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b791-8\">\u201cNow, I could stand up here and give you this rigmarole or business about the law, the burden of proof, and he is presumed innocent, and you should remember that, and her Honor is going to instruct you about that. The defendant has no burden to get up on the stand and tell his case or prove he is innocent. That burden is on the Commonwealth to prove it beyond a reasonable doubt to a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"772\">*772</page-number>moral certainty. But let\u2019s be realistic, you either believe him or you don\u2019t, and that\u2019s what this case is all about. And I suggest that you should.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b792-5\">We review defense counsel\u2019s comments to determine whether any alleged error was likely to have influenced the jury\u2019s conclusion. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mello, supra </em>at 393. \u201cRemarks made during closing arguments are considered in the context of the entire argument, and in light of the judge\u2019s instructions to the jury and the evidence at trial.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Viriyahiranpaiboon, </em>412 Mass. 224, 231 (1992), and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-6\">Defense counsel focused on the weaknesses of the prosecutor\u2019s case and the strengths of the defense and suggested to the jury that they believe the defendant\u2019s version of the events. Defense counsel closed by arguing that the jury could not be morally certain of the defendant\u2019s guilt. Furthermore, in light of the judge\u2019s careful instructions to the jury explaining the presumption of innocence and the Commonwealth\u2019s burden of proof, it does not appear likely that defense counsel\u2019s remarks influenced the jury\u2019s verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-7\">4. <em>Admission of the photograph. </em>The defendant contends that the judge erred in admitting a photograph depicting the victim\u2019s body as it was discovered in a closet of her home.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-8\">\u201cThe admission of photographs is committed to the sound discretion of the trial judge, and we have rarely reversed a conviction because of the introduction of photographs of a victim.\u201d <em>Commonwealth v. Meinholz, </em>420 Mass. 633, 635 (1995). \u201cWhether the photograph[] [was] \u2018so inflammatory in nature as to outweigh [its] probative value and preclude [its] admission is a question to be determined by the trial judge in the exercise of [her] sound discretion.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ramos, </em>406 Mass. 397, 407 (1990), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>D\u2019Agostino, </em>344 Mass. 276, 279 (1962). Here, the judge did not abuse her discretion in determining that the probative value of the photograph outweighed any possible prejudicial effect. The photograph depicted the victim\u2019s body crouched in a closet, wrapped in a blanket with a sneaker placed on top of her, which corroborated the details of the defendant\u2019s confessions. Thus, the photograph was probative on the issue of the defendant\u2019s credibility where he claimed that he had falsely confessed as part of an agreement with the victim\u2019s mother. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Merola, </em>405 Mass. 529, 544-545 (1989). It was also probative of consciousness of guilt. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Meinholz, su</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"773\">*773</page-number><em>pra </em>at 636 (photographs depicting how victim\u2019s body was encased in plastic and tied up with rope before being buried in defendant\u2019s cellar were found relevant to issue of extreme atrocity or cruelty, deliberate premeditation, and consciousness of guilt), and cases cited. Consequently, there was no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-5\">5. <em>Relief under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E. </em>The defendant requests that we order a new trial or reduce his verdict. We have reviewed the entire record pursuant to G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E, and conclude that a reduction in the verdict or a new trial is not required.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b793-7\">\n<em>Order denying motion for a new trial affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b784-9\">The underlying felony, for which the Commonwealth did not obtain an indictment, was statutory rape.

In reviewing the judge\u2019s decision, we \u201caccept[] the judge\u2019s subsidiary findings of fact absent clear error, give[] substantial deference to the judge\u2019s ultimate findings and conclusions of law, but independently reviewf] the correctness of the judge\u2019s application of constitutional principles to the facts found.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Magee, 423 Mass. 381, 384 (1996), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mello, </em>420 Mass. 375, 381 n.8 (1995). We have reviewed the ruling and conclude that there was no error. The judge could properly credit the troopers\u2019 testimony that the defendant was calm during the interviews, that he did not appear to be under the influence of drugs, and that he understood the Miranda warnings. At no time did the defendant ask to speak with an attorney. There was no evidence that the defendant was forced or coerced into speaking with the troopers.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b791-9\">At the new trial hearing, defense counsel testified that the defendant never told him that he wanted to testify. Rather, defense counsel testified that he had advised the defendant not to testify at the hearing, so as not to alert the prosecution to their anticipated defense.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
