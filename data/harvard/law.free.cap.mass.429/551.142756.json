L. c. 40B, \u00a7 21.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The defendant zoning board of appeals of Gloucester (board) scheduled a public hearing on the authority\u2019s application. Because the public hearing did not occur within thirty days of the board\u2019s receipt of the application, as is required by G. L. c. 40B, \u00a7 21, the application was constructively approved.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">Mac Stewart Bell, trustee of M-M Realty Trust (trustee), an abutter of the authority\u2019s land, appealed to the Superior Court asserting that, because the board failed to hold a public hearing, he was precluded from airing his opposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-6\">After the denial of their motions to dismiss and for summary judgment the authority and the board jointly moved to dismiss, asserting that the trustee lacked standing because he was not an \u201caggrieved person,\u201d which the statutes require as a prerequisite to appealing from a grant of a comprehensive permit.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The trustee again opposed the motion, claiming that, because his property abutted the proposed project site, he enjoyed a rebut-table presumption that he had standing as an \u201caggrieved\u201d person.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-7\">The judge treated the motion as one for summary judgment and allowed the motion. She ruled that the defendants had successfully rebutted the trustee\u2019s presumptive standing because there was no evidence showing that the proposed project would affect any legally protected interests of the trustee.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-8\">On appeal the trustee argues that (1) the judge applied the wrong standing requirements; (2) even if the judge applied the correct rule, she incorrectly ruled that the trustee was not an \u201caggrieved\u201d person under that standard; and that (3) the judge erred in treating the defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss under Mass. R. Civ. P. 12 (b) (1), 365 Mass. 754 (1974), as a motion for summary judgment. We transferred the case to this court on our own motion. We now conclude that the judge\u2019s ruling was correct as to these claims and affirm the grant of summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>1. <em>Standing requirements. </em>The trustee argues that the standing requirements of G. L. c. 40A are not applicable to appeals under G. L. c. 40B. The trustee points out that G. L. c. 40A, which governs local zoning, is designed to protect \u201cthe public interest of certain neighborhoods against uses which are believed to be deleterious to such neighborhoods,\u201d <em>Kaplan </em>v. Boston, 330 Mass. 381, 384 (1953), citing <em>Circle Lounge &amp; Grill, Inc. </em>v. <em>Board of Appeal of Boston, </em>324 Mass. 427, 431 (1949), and as such, encourages local authorities to adopt zoning regulations. The trustee contends that G. L. c. 40B, on the other hand, is designed to diminish local authority by allowing the Commonwealth to override a local zoning regulation where such regulation may impede the construction of low income housing. From this distinction, the trustee broadly concludes that these legislative policies are mutually exclusive, and therefore a single rule of standing cannot adequately accommodate both chapters.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> This argument is unavailing.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">The trustee\u2019s argument ignores the plain language of G. L. c. 40B, \u00a7 21, which provides that persons \u201caggrieved by the issuance of a comprehensive permit. . . may appeal to the court <em>as provided in section seventeen of chapter forty </em>A\u201d (emphasis added). As the judge below correctly noted, this unambiguous legislative directive disposes of the trustee\u2019s argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-6\">Furthermore, we see no conflict between a policy geared toward overcoming local objection to low income housing and a rule of standing that limits the right to appeal from the grant of a permit. We therefore agree with the judge that the same standing requirements apply to appeals under G. L. c. 40A and G. L. c. 40B appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-7\">2. <em>Rebuttal of presumptive standing. </em>In <em>Marashlian </em>v. <em>Zoning Bd. of Appeals of Newburyport, </em>421 Mass. 719, 721 (1996), we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b573-8\">\u201cAbutters . . . enjoy a rebuttable presumption they are \u2018persons aggrieved.\u2019 ... If standing is challenged, the jurisdictional question is decided on \u2018all the evidence with no benefit to tile plaintiffs from the presumption.\u2019 ... A review of standing based on \u2018all the evidence\u2019 does not require that the factfinder ultimately find a plaintiff\u2019s al<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>legations meritorious. To do so would be to deny standing, after the fact, to any unsuccessful plaintiff. Rather, the plaintiff must put forth credible evidence to substantiate his allegations. In this context, standing becomes, then, essentially a question of fact for the trial judge.\u201d (Citation omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">The trustee argues that the defendants presented no evidence to rebut his presumptive, standing and, accordingly, the judge erred in ruling that he was not an \u201caggrieved\u201d party under G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 17. But the judge ruled that the trustee\u2019s deposition testimony failed to show that the proposed project will impair any interests of the trustee that are protected by the zoning law. Thus, the defendants have rebutted the trustee\u2019s presumption of standing and the trustee has failed to offer any evidence of \u201ca plausible claim of a definite violation of a private right, a private property interest, or a private legal interest\u201d necessary to challenge the permit at issue. <em>Harvard Square Defense Fund, Inc. </em>v. <em>Planning Bd. of Cambridge, </em>27 Mass. App. Ct. 491, 493 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b574-6\">For example, the complaint alleges that the defendants\u2019 permit application proposal (1) fails to consider whether the proposed housing would suit the neighborhood scheme generally; (2) may not \u201cprovide for the highest and best use of the taxpayers\u2019 Public Lands and Public Funds\u201d; (3) lacks exploration of other potential low income housing solutions; and (4) does not conform to the layout of the local neighborhood. To the extent that these allegations aver any injury, the injury inures only to the detriment of the community at large, and not to the trustee specifically. Although the trustee also alleged that the proposed project would \u201celiminate^ the option to provide any additional parking or access\u201d to a local playing field, neither his complaint nor his deposition testimony indicates that the proposed project would take away parking to which he was legally entitled. Instead, he alleges only that the project may someday limit the community\u2019s ability to gain access to and to park by the playing field.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-7\">The trustee failed to offer any evidence to \u201cestablish \u2014 by direct facts and not by speculative personal opinion \u2014 that his injury is special and different from the concerns of the rest of the community.\u201d <em>Barvenik </em>v. <em>Aldermen of Newton, </em>33 Mass. App. Ct. 129, 132 (1992). Accordingly, the judge did not err in ruling that the trustee is not an aggrieved person under G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>3. <em>Propriety of treating the motion to dismiss as one for summary judgment. </em>The trustee next challenges the judge\u2019s treatment of the defendants\u2019 motion under Mass. R. Civ. P. 12 (b) (1), as a summary judgment motion.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> To support this challenge, he relies solely on <em>Watros </em>v. <em>Greater Lynn Mental Health &amp; Retardation Ass\u2019n, </em>421 Mass. 106, 109 (1995). In that case we concluded that a motion to dismiss brought under rule 12 (b) (1) was not required to be treated as a motion for summary judgment where the judge considered matters outside the pleadings. We reasoned that, under the plain language of rule 12, where a party presented (and the judge admitted) material outside the pleadings, only Mass. R. Civ. P. 12 (b) (6), 365 Mass. 754 (1974) (failure to state a claim on which relief can be granted) <em>compels </em>the judge to treat the motion to dismiss as one for summary judgment. However, we have never held that this logic <em>precludes </em>a judge from treating a motion under rule 12 (b) (1) as one for summary judgment in the appropriate circumstance. We decline to do so here. The judge acted within her discretion in treating the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss as a motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">We therefore conclude that the judge\u2019s dismissal was proper and affirm the decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b572-9\">General Laws c. 40B, \u00a7 21, provides in part: \u201cAny public agency . . . proposing to build low or moderate income housing may submit to the board of appeals ... a single application to build such housing . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b572-10\">General Laws c. 40B, \u00a7 21, further provides in relevant, part: \u201cAny person aggrieved by the issuance of a comprehensive permit or approval may appeal to the court as provided in section seventeen of chapter forty A.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b572-11\">General Laws c. 40A, \u00a7 17, in turn, provides: \u201cAny person aggrieved by a decision of the board of appeals . . . may appeal . . . .\u201d Thus, a party must be \u201caggrieved\u201d to have standing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b573-9\">We note that, despite his objection to the judge\u2019s application of G. L. c. 40A\u2019s standing requirements to appeals under G. L. c. 40B, the trustee suggests no alternative standard.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b575-7\">The trustee also argues that the judge improperly ignored his assertion that the defendants\u2019 failure to serve him with a copy of the deposition statements and affidavit (on which they partially relied in moving to dismiss the action) did not comport with Rule 9A of the Rules of the Superior Court (1999). Rule 9A (a) (1) provides in part: \u201cThe moving party shall serve with the <em>motion </em>a statement of reasons, including supporting authorities, why the motion should be granted. . . . Affidavits and other documents setting forth or evidencing facts on which the motion is based shall be served with the motion.\u201d This argument is unavailing. Even without the unserved documents, the pleadings alleged only generalized damages. Because the pleadings alone would have sufficiently rebutted the standing presumption, the error, if any, did not prejudice the trustee\u2019s claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
