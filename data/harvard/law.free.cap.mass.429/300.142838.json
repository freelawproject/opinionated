We allowed the plaintiff\u2019s application for direct appellate review. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">The plaintiff was a resident of property owned by the defendant. She slipped and fell on ice that had accumulated on exterior stairs on the defendant\u2019s property. The plaintiff sued the defendant alleging (1) negligence; (2) breach of the implied warranty of habitability; (3) breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment; and (4) violation of the lease. After the plaintiff presented her case, the defendant successfully moved for a directed verdict on all but the negligence claim. A jury then found for the defendant on the negligence claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-6\">1. <em>Negligence. </em>At trial, the defendant acknowledged that it had a duty to remove snow and ice. The central issue was whether the defendant was negligent in performing that duty. That issue was sent to the jury and the jury determined that the defendant was not negligent.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-7\">\u201c[T]he better procedure in a case in which it is a close question whether the standard for granting a directed verdict is met is to allow the matter to go to the jury. If the judge then decides that the jury\u2019s verdict cannot stand, a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict may be allowed.\u201d <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Ariens Co., </em>375 Mass. 620, 627 (1978), citing <em>Soares </em>v. <em>Lakeville Baseball Camp, Inc., 369 </em>Mass. 974, 975 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b321-8\">We <em>reject </em>the plaintiff\u2019s contention that she is entitled to a new trial based on her claims that the defendant violated the lease<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and the covenant of quiet enjoyment, G. L. c. 186, \u00a7 14. Negligence is a prerequisite for recovery under both theories. See <em>Al-Ziab </em>v. <em>Mourgis, </em>424 Mass. 847, 850 (1997) (showing of negligence is required for recovery under quiet enjoyment statute); <em>Anderson </em>v. <em>Fox Hill Village Homeowners Corp., </em>424 Mass. 365, 367 (1997) (\u201ca landlord, who agrees in a lease to remove snow and ice and negligently fails to perform that duty <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>may be liable to his tenant\u201d); <em>Carey </em>v. <em>Malley, </em>327 Mass. 189, 193 (1951). The jury\u2019s determination that the defendant was not negligent precludes the possibility that the directed verdicts on these claims constitute a basis for a new trial. Both the lease and the State code provisions merely restated a duty which the defendant acknowledged. We turn now to issues arising from the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-5\">2. <em>The trial, </em>(a) <em>Verbal completeness. </em>On cross-examination, the plaintiff testified that she did not call the work order center to complain about a recurrent problem of ice on the front stairs. Rather, she spoke to a person in the management office because the work order system was ineffective. Defense counsel then read a portion of her deposition testimony where she stated that she had always received a proper response from the work order center.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b322-6\">On redirect examination, the plaintiff\u2019s counsel sought to rehabilitate the plaintiff by introducing other portions of the deposition testimony under the doctrine of verbal completeness. Over the defendant\u2019s objection, the plaintiff\u2019s counsel was allowed to read the next several lines of the deposition testimony. This testimony described the plaintiff\u2019s problems with the work order system. The plaintiff\u2019s counsel then sought to introduce additional portions of the plaintiff\u2019s deposition testimony, under the doctrine of verbal completeness.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The judge sustained the defendant\u2019s objection, reasoning that the plaintiff\u2019s counsel was required to object, under the doctrine of verbal completeness, at the time the deposition was originally used by the defendant. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>According to the plaintiff, she was prejudiced because the statements introduced by the defendant were taken out of context and the jurors were given a false and misleading impression of a material fact. The plaintiff further contends that the proffered statements would have allowed counsel to rehabilitate the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">Under the doctrine of verbal completeness, when one party introduces a written or verbal statement, \u201cthe other party may add what has been omitted to give a full picture.\u201d <em>Kobayashi </em>v. <em>Orion Ventures, Inc., </em>42 Mass. App. Ct. 492, 498 (1997). The judge\u2019s decision to exclude the additional deposition testimony was within her discretion. The plaintiff\u2019s counsel read the next several lines of the deposition following those offered by the defendant. This testimony, establishing that the plaintiff had problems with the work order system, was sufficient to complete the \u201cfull picture\u201d as raised by cross-examination. See <em>id. </em>The portion excluded by the judge appeared a number of pages later in the deposition transcript, and the record does not reflect that the additional proffered testimony explained further the picture painted by defense counsel. See <em>id. </em>at 497 (\u201c[Verbal completeness doctrine] does not open the gate for everything in a document or statement. There is always the test of relevance\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b323-6\">We agree with the judge\u2019s conclusion that the better practice is to require an objection and contemporaneous introduction of the complete statements when the original statement is offered. That procedure prevents the jury from receiving the statement in a fragmentary manner and also allows the jury to consider the offered statement as a whole, which in turn furthers the \u201cfull picture\u201d rationale of the doctrine. See <em>id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b323-7\">(b) <em>Introduction of the State codes in evidence. </em>The plaintiff argues that the judge erred by prohibiting her counsel from referring, in his opening statement, to provisions in the State sanitary and building codes, requiring the defendant to keep the stairs free of snow and ice, and from introducing the code provisions in evidence \u201cearly in the case.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> See <em>Passanessi </em>v. <em>C.J. Maney Co., </em>340 Mass. 599, 603-604 (1960). According to the plaintiff, this error requires a new trial because the code provisions had a central place in the case and because the code provi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>sions were referred to in the lease. The plaintiff asserts that the reading of the relevant portions of the codes during the jury charge was insufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">We agree with the plaintiff that the codes were admissible. See <em>id. </em>However, the failure to introduce the relevant portions of the codes in evidence does not require a new trial. Although the code provisions established a duty on the part of the defendant to remove snow and ice, the defendant never challenged that it owed the plaintiff that duty. The only issue was whether the defendant violated its duty and that was determined by the jury. Further, the relevant portions of the codes were read to the jurors, and they were instructed properly that a violation of the codes was to be considered as evidence of negligence. Thus, even though the codes were not introduced in evidence, the jurors were aware of them and their significance. A new trial is not warranted based on the failure to introduce the codes in evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-6\">(c) <em>Jury instructions. </em>The plaintiff complains that the judge erred in instructing the jurors on the weight the jurors should accord the State sanitary and building codes.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-7\">The judge instructed that a violation of a code provision was to be considered as evidence of negligence, but that \u201c[i]t should not be taken as conclusive of a breach of the duty of care.\u201d According to the plaintiff, this instruction required the jurors to find some additional evidence of negligence before they could determine that the defendant was liable to the plaintiff.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The plaintiff argues that the judge should have further instructed that jurors have the discretion to determine negligence based solely on a violation of the code.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-8\">The judge defined negligence as \u201cthe performance or the omission of some act in violation of a legal duty.\u201d She instructed that, because the defendant had a duty, the plaintiff was required to show that \u201cthe Defendant failed to exercise the . . . amount <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>of care that a prudent person would exercise [in] the circumstances.\u201d She then read from the codes and explained that a violation of a code provision is not conclusive on the issue of liability. Rather, it is evidence of negligence. This instruction is consistent with the language used in <em>Perry </em>v. <em>Medeiros, </em>369 Mass. 836, 841 (1976). See <em>id., </em>and cases cited. There was no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">3. <em>Implied warranty of habitability. </em>The plaintiff argues that the judge erroneously granted the defendant\u2019s motion for a directed verdict as to the plaintiff\u2019s claim of breach of the implied warranty of habitability.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> According to the plaintiff, the defendant is liable under the implied warranty of habitability for injuries resulting from the failure of the landlord to comply with State sanitary and building code provisions that require the removal of snow and ice. There was no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-6\">The implied warranty of habitability \u201cis concerned with the provision, maintenance, and repair of the <em>physical </em>facilities vital to the use of the leased premises\u201d (emphasis in original). <em>Doe </em>v. <em>New Bedford Hous. Auth., </em>417 Mass. 273, 282 (1994). Not every breach of the State sanitary code supports a claim under the implied warranty of habitability. Rather, the implied warranty of habitability applies to significant defects in the property itself. <em>Berman &amp; Sons </em>v. <em>Jefferson, </em>379 Mass. 196, 201-202 (1979) (\u201cA dwelling afflicted with a substantial Sanitary Code violation is not habitable\u201d). See, e.g., <em>Cruz Mgt. Co. </em>v. <em>Thomas, </em>417 Mass. 782, 787 (1994) (apartment lacked adequate heat, hot water, and fire escape; was infested with cockroaches, mice, and rats; had unsanitary common areas; and had defective smoke detector, windows, and wiring); <em>Simon </em>v. <em>Solomon, </em>385 Mass. 91, 93, 96 (1982) (water and sewage repeatedly flooded apartment); <em>Crowell </em>v. <em>McCaffrey, </em>377 Mass. 443, 451 (1979) (defec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>tive railing on third-floor porch). The natural accumulation of snow and ice is not such a defect. See <em>Aylward </em>v. <em>McCloskey, </em>412 Mass. 77, 79 (1992); <em>Gamere </em>v. <em>236 Commonwealth Ave. Condominium Ass\u2019n, </em>19 Mass. App. Ct. 359, 363 (1985). Thus, the directed verdict on the implied warranty of habitability claim was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b321-9\">The lease agreement between the parties contained a provision whereby the defendant agreed to \u201c[mjaintain buildings and common areas and grounds of the project in decent, safe and sanitary condition in conformity with the requirements of local housing and sanitary codes and applicable [Fjederal and [Sjtate regulations!, and rjemove all snow [and] ice . . . from the sidewalks, parking areas and driveways and other common areas . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b322-7\">The plaintiff was asked, \u201cHave you ever contacted the work order center with a request for maintenance and not received a proper response to your request?\u201d The plaintiff answered, \u201cNo.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b322-8\">The plaintiff\u2019s counsel also argued at trial that the additional portion of the deposition, where the plaintiff had described previous instances of ice accumulation, was admissible as a \u201cprior consistent statement where [defense counsel] rebutted it with prior inconsistent [statements] . . . it\u2019s a hearsay exception apart from completeness.\u201d She now claims that she was prejudiced when the judge \u201cindicated\u201d that counsel would not be allowed to introduce other deposition testimony on \u201cdifferent evidentiary grounds.\u201d According to the plaintiff, the judge \u201cshut down\u201d counsel\u2019s attempts to rehabilitate the witness. There was no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-9\">The prior inconsistent statement used to impeach the plaintiff related to the plaintiff\u2019s experience with the work order system, not the accumulation of snow and ice. Contrary to the plaintiff\u2019s contention, the judge was within her discretion to limit the use of the deposition to issues raised on cross-examination.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b323-8\">The State sanitary code and building code require a landlord to keep all exterior stairways \u201cfree of snow and ice,\u201d 105 Code Mass.

Piemonte, 349 Mass. 761, 761 (1965), quoting <em>Landers </em>v. <em>Brooks, </em>295 Mass. 344, 348 (1936).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b324-10\">The plaintiff does not argue that a violation of the code is negligence per se. Rather, the plaintiff argues that the instructions failed to convey that a violation of the code is sufficient, in and of itself, to warrant a finding of liability.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b325-7\">The defendant asserts that, even assuming that the plaintiff\u2019s alternative claims are meritorious, the plaintiff only filed notice of the negligence claim. G. L. c. 258, \u00a7 4. Therefore, the other claims are barred. See <em>G &amp; B Assocs., Inc. </em>v. <em>Springfield, </em>39 Mass. App. Ct. 51 (1995). We do not agree. The purpose of the presentment provision is to allow the executive officer \u201can adequate opportunity to investigate the circumstances surrounding [the] claim.\u201d <em>Weaver </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>387 Mass. 43, 47 (1982). We conclude that the requirements of \u00a7 4 were satisfied. <em>Gilmore </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>417 Mass. 718, 723 (1994). The proper authority was placed on notice of the circumstances surrounding the alleged injury. The executive officer had the opportunity to investigate the circumstances of each claim, as all theories of liability argued by the plaintiff were based on the same facts.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
