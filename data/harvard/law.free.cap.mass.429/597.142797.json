Brusard (Brusard) brought this medical malpractice action on behalf of herself and her now nine year old daughter, Kaileigh, against obstetrician Terence J. O\u2019Toole alleging that Dr. O\u2019Toole\u2019s malpractice resulted in severe neurological brain injury to Kaileigh. At issue on appeal is an evidentiary ruling by the trial judge excluding from evidence a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>chart contained in a medical treatise, but prepared by someone other than the author of the treatise.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-5\">Brusard commenced her action in December, 1992. In November, 1995, after a seven-day jury trial, the jury returned a verdict in favor of Dr. O\u2019Toole. The judge denied Brusard\u2019s motion for a new trial. She took an appeal from the judgment and the denial of the motion for a new trial claiming error (1) in the judge\u2019s exclusion of the medical chart for the purpose of cross-examining defense expert witnesses pursuant to Proposed Mass. R. Evid. 803 (18), adopted by <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sneed, </em>413 Mass. 387, 396 (1992); and (2) in his refusal to admit the chart under G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 79C. Brusard also alleged error in the judge\u2019s exclusion of Brockton Hospital\u2019s written policies and procedures in effect at the time of Kaileigh\u2019s birth. The Appeals Court reversed the judgment and ordered a new trial, concluding that it was error to exclude the medical treatise evidence for the purpose of cross-examining defense witnesses. <em>Brusard </em>v. <em>O\u2019Toole, </em>45 Mass. App. Ct. 288, 290-294 (1998). We granted Dr. O\u2019Toole\u2019s application for further appellate review. We vacate the judgment and remand this case to the Superior Court for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b618-7\">Brusard became a patient of Dr. O\u2019Toole\u2019s approximately ten weeks into this, her first, pregnancy. Dr. O\u2019Toole treated her throughout the course of her pregnancy. Brusard was twenty-one years old at the time, and her pregnancy was uneventful prior to her delivery. Her estimated date for delivery was April 13, 1990. On April 18, 1990, because Brusard was one week past her estimated due date, Dr. O\u2019Toole ordered an oxytocin challenge test to assess the well-being of the fetus.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The results were normal. On April 23, 1990, when Brusard still had not delivered her baby, Dr. O\u2019Toole ordered a second oxytocin challenge test. The results again were normal. A biophysical profile, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>another test to assess the health of the fetus, was performed the following day at approximately 11 a.m.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The biophysical profile indicated a \u201cflunking\u201d score of two out of a possible eight, and showed that the fetus had a \u201c[l]ack of movement, lack of breathing effort and lack of tone.\u201d The amniotic fluid level was normal. Brusard was admitted to Brockton Hospital at 12:10 p.m., in active labor. The electronic monitoring of the fetus commenced by the nursing staff indicated minimal fetal activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-5\">When Brusard was admitted, Dr. O\u2019Toole was seeing patients at another facility and did not arrive at Brockton Hospital until 2:10 p.m. He determined then that Brusard was \u201cin quite active labor\u201d and \u201cdecided to watch her closely as long as she was in labor to see what happened.\u201d The record indicates that Dr. O\u2019Toole was not on site at the hospital from approximately 2:45 p.m. until 7:30 p.m. At 5:34 p.m., the fetal heart rate dropped precipitously for several minutes. The labor nurse called Dr. O\u2019Toole, who ordered preparation of Brusard for a caesarian section. Brusard\u2019s labor progressed normally during this period of time, and the caesarian section was not performed after the fetal heart rate rebounded.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-6\">Dr. O\u2019Toole next examined Brusard at 7:30 p.m. At 8:45 p.m., he concluded that Brusard\u2019s labor had failed to progress and that a caesarian section was necessary. He delivered Kaileigh by caesarian section at 9:45 p.m. Kaileigh required resuscitation and intubation, and was unable to breathe on her own for five minutes after her birth. She was transferred to Boston Children\u2019s Hospital where she was treated for birth asphyxia (oxygen deprivation). From birth, Kaileigh has suffered from a serious seizure disorder, behavior problems with attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder, speech difficulties, and motor coordination difficulties of both upper and lower extremities which will \u201cpersist for the remainder of her normal life expectancy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b619-7\">Brusard\u2019s theory at trial was that the poor score on the biophysical profile indicated that the fetus was suffering from asphyxia, mandating immediate delivery. Through the expert testimony of an obstetrician-gynecologist and a pediatric <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>neurologist, she sought to establish that the fetus had suffered a major insult at some point after the second oxytocin challenge test showed normal results. Her expert pediatric neurologist testified that, in his opinion, Kaileigh had suffered three strokes as a result of blood clots blocking arteries in her brain, one of which occurred at 5:34 p.m. when the fetal heart rate dropped so dramatically, and that a lack of oxygen in the brain, a drop in the fetal blood pressure, and blood clots that formed in the brain caused the strokes. In his opinion, \u201cthe bulk of the damage to this brain occurred in the last ten hours of [Ms. Brusard]\u2019s labor, and particularly in the last six hours of the labor,\u201d i.e., <em>after </em>the biophysical profile was performed. He opined that, by waiting until 9:45 p.m. to deliver Kaileigh, Dr. O\u2019Toole\u2019s treatment fell below the accepted standards of care and caused Kaileigh\u2019s brain injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-5\">Dr. O\u2019Toole proffered an alternative theory. Through the expert testimony of an obstetrician-gynecologist, pathologist, and pediatric neurologist, he sought to establish that the stroke that caused Kaileigh\u2019s brain injury had occurred prior to the time of the biophysical profile, and that the low profile score reflected the stroke, not fetal asphyxia. His theory was that multiple emboli,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> blood clots that originated in the umbilical cord, traveled through Kaileigh\u2019s body and ultimately lodged in the arteries of her brain, causing the stroke. His expert pediatric neurologist testified that, based on the positive results of the second oxytocin challenge test and the poor results of the biophysical profile, it was his opinion that the stroke had occurred between the two tests, that is before the biophysical profile was performed. He opined that Kaileigh\u2019s outcome would have been no different had she been delivered immediately after Dr. O\u2019Toole obtained the results of the biophysical profile.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-6\">n</p>\n<p id=\"b620-7\">The critical points of contention were whether fetal asphyxia had caused Kaileigh\u2019s stroke (or strokes) and resulting brain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>injury, whether the biophysical profile score indicated fetal asphyxia, and whether Dr. O\u2019Toole should have delivered Kaileigh immediately upon learning the results of the biophysical profile. Brusard sought to introduce in evidence a chart on biophysical profiles taken from the 1993 edition of a medical text, Williams, Obstetrics (19th ed. 1993). The chart contains three columns: one entitled \u201cBiophysical Profile Score,\u201d the second entitled \u201cInterpretation,\u201d and the third entitled \u201cRecommended Management.\u201d According to the chart, a biophysical profile score of \u201c0-2\u201d (column one), the range in which Kaileigh\u2019s score fell, corresponds to an interpretation of \u201cAlmost certain fetal asphyxia\u201d (column two) and a recommended management of \u201cDeliver\u201d (column three). The chart was authored by and credited in the Williams text to \u201cManning and colleagues (1987), with permission.\u201d The judge excluded the entire chart from admission in evidence under G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 79C. Relying on Proposed Mass. R. Evid. 803 (18), the judge allowed Brusard to cross-examine certain defense witnesses with the information contained in columns one and three only.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b621-6\">Proposed Mass. R. Evid. 803 (18), which we adopted in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sneed, </em>413 Mass. 387, 396 (1992), provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b621-7\">\u201cThe following are not excluded by the hearsay rule, even though the declarant is available as a witness: . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b621-8\">\u201c(18) Learned Treatises. To the extent called to the attention of an expert witness upon cross-examination, statements contained in published treatises, periodicals, or pamphlets on a subject of history, medicine, or other science or art, established as a reliable authority by the testimony or admission of the witness or by other expert testimony or by judicial notice. If admitted, the statements may be read into evidence but may not be received as exhibits.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b621-9\">The question is whether the language \u201cestablished as a reliable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>authority\u201d modifies \u201cstatement\u201d (here, the chart), as Dr. O\u2019Toole argues, or \u201ctreatise,\u201d as Brusard contends. Under the rule, an opponent of the expert witness seeking to use a statement of another incorporated in a treatise must establish that the treatise itself, and not the statement (or chart) contained therein, is \u201ca reliable authority.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b622-5\">When we adopted proposed rule 803 (18) in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sneed, supra </em>at 396, we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-6\">\u201cProposed rule 803 (18) requires that an opponent of the expert witness bring to the witness\u2019s attention a specific statement in a <em>treatise that has been established, to the judge\u2019s satisfaction, as a reliable authority. </em>The witness should be given a fair opportunity to assess the statement in context and to comment on it, either during cross-examination or on redirect examination. The judge, of course, will have to determine the relevance and materiality of the statement and should consider carefully any claimed unfairness or confusion that admission of the statement may create.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b622-7\">We also said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-8\">\u201cWe see potential benefit, and little risk of harm, in adopting the proposed Massachusetts rule of evidence, which permits a party challenging an expert\u2019s opinion to interrogate that expert about a relevant, divergent opinion expressed <em>in a reputable book. </em>See <em>Reilly </em>v. <em>Pinkus, </em>338 U.S. 269, 275 (1949). Admission in evidence of a statement <em>from a treatise of the kind referred to in proposed rule 803 (18), whose authenticity and reliability are shown, </em>which was not written for use in litigation, and which expresses an expert opinion on a subject relevant to the case on trial, will tend to enhance, rather than detract from, the truth-finding function\u201d (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b622-9\"><em>Id. </em>We think it a logical reading of the language both of the rule and of our decision in that case, that the rule contemplates that an authored treatise, and not the statements contained therein, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>must be established as a reliable authority. See W.G. Young, J.R. Pollets, &amp; C. Poreda, Evidence \u00a7 803.18, at 188 (1998) (\u201cparty seeking to admit the learned treatise [on cross-examination] must first lay a foundation that the treatise is a reliable authority\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b623-5\">The defendant relies on cases addressing the admissibility of articles published in journals under the cognate Fed. R. Evid. 803 (18) to support his contention that a plaintiff must establish the chart, and not the treatise, as reliable authority. <em>Twin City Fire Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Country Mut. Ins. Co., </em>23 F.3d 1175, 1184 (7th Cir. 1994) (author of particular article must be shown to be an authority); <em>Meschino </em>v. <em>North Am. Drager, Inc., </em>841 F.2d 429, 434 (1st Cir. 1988) (must show article itself to be reliable authority). This reliance is misplaced. The circumstances in which a treatise author incorporates the materials of others into his or her own work are very different from those in which a journal editor publishes articles authored by others, or in which an editor assembles chapters authored by others in a compendium. That the author of a treatise, established as a reliable authority, incorporates or relies on information attributable to others in his or her own work, published under his or her own name, is sufficient to vouch for the reliability of the material contained therein.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We presume that, when writing a treatise, an author includes material he or she believes to be authoritative or illustrative. In the context of a journal or periodical, however, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>\u201c[i]n these days of quantified research, and pressure to publish, an article does not reach the dignity of a \u2018reliable authority\u2019 merely because some editor, even a most reputable one, sees fit to circulate it.\u201d <em>Meschino </em>v. <em>North Am. Drager, Inc., supra </em>at 434.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> A party seeking to introduce a statement contained in an authored treatise, as distinguished from an edited compendium, journal, or periodical, for the purpose of cross-examination under proposed rule 803 (18), must establish that the treatise, not the statement itself, is a reliable authority.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b624-5\">The extent to which the text makes clear that the author either disavows the material, or that it is plainly irrelevant to the subject of the treatise, is the proper subject matter of the expert\u2019s redirect examination, once admitted. In this case, Dr. O\u2019Toole\u2019s objections to the context and meaning of the chart may be addressed by \u201ca fair opportunity to assess the statement in context and to comment on it, either during cross-examination or on redirect examination.\u201d <em>Sneed, supra </em>at 396.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>The judge in this case properly evaluated the reliability of the treatise, as opposed to the chart itself, when deciding whether the chart was admissible for use on cross-examination pursuant to proposed rule 803 (18). We agree with the Appeals Court\u2019s conclusion that, based on his ruling, it is \u201creasonable to infer from his decision to permit use of two-thirds of the chart that the judge considered the text Williams on Obstetrics to be \u2018a reliable authority.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>Brusard </em>v. <em>O\u2019Toole, </em>45 Mass. App. Ct. 288, 291 (1998). No apparent reason exists for excluding only one of the three columns.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Had the judge determined that the treatise was not a rehable authority, we presume he would not have allowed Brusard to use any aspect of the chart on cross-examination. The exclusion of column two for the purposes of cross-examination pursuant to proposed rule 803 (18) was error.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b625-6\">The judge excluded the chart from evidence under G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 79C, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-7\">\u201cStatements of facts or opinions on a subject of science or art contained in a published treatise, periodical, book or pamphlet shall, in so far as the court shall find that the said statements are relevant and that the writer of such statements is recognized in his profession or calling as an expert on the subject, be admissible in actions of . . . tort for malpractice . . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b625-8\">In affirming the judge\u2019s exclusion of the chart under G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 79C, the Appeals Court focused on whether the plaintiffs had established that \u201cManning and colleagues\u201d are recognized as experts in their profession, relying on the statutory phrase \u201cthe <em>writer of such statements </em>is recognized in his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>profession ... as an expert on the subject\u201d (emphasis added), <em>supra </em>at 294-295, <em>Brusard </em>v. <em>O\u2019Toole, </em>concluding that the \u201cwriter\u201d of the chart in question was \u201cManning and colleagues,\u201d not the authors of the Williams treatise.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">When determining the admissibility of a published treatise under G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 79C, we interpret the \u201cwriter of such statements\u201d to mean the treatise author, not the author of each individual item incorporated into the treatise text. There is nothing to suggest that G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 79C, contemplates a reliability analysis different from proposed rule 803 (18). Our discussion regarding the difference between the reliability of an authored treatise and a periodical published by an editor in the context of proposed rule 803 (18) is equally applicable in the context of G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 79C. In our view, the \u201cwriter\u201d of a statement contained in an authored treatise is the author of the treatise, and the \u201cwriter\u201d of a statement contained in a periodical or similarly edited publication is the author of the specific article in which the st\u00e1tement is contained.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The exclusion of the chart, to the extent that the judge based his ruling on Brusard\u2019s failure to lay a proper foundation regarding \u201cManning and colleagues,\u201d was error.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b627-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>c</p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\">We have no difficulty concluding that these errors were prejudicial to Brusard. The critical issues at trial were whether Dr. O\u2019Toole complied with the standard of care in treating Kaileigh and whether fetal asphyxia, as the plaintiffs contended, or emboli, as the defense argued, caused Kaileigh\u2019s stroke or strokes. As the Appeals Court correctly discussed at greater length, <em>Brusard </em>v. <em>O\u2019Toole, supra </em>at 292-294, we cannot \u201csay with substantial confidence that the error would not have made a material difference.\u201d <em>DeJesus </em>v. <em>Yogel, </em>404 Mass. 44, 49 (1989). The opportunity to cross-examine the defense experts as to their opinions, in light of the chart, that Dr. O\u2019Toole complied with the relevant standard of care and that emboli, not asphyxia, caused Kaileigh\u2019s strokes may well have changed the jury\u2019s evaluation of the experts\u2019 testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-6\">The defendant argues, however, that in any event the chart contained in the 1993 edition of Williams, Obstetrics, was irrelevant to the standard of care to which he was held in 1990, and that any error caused by its exclusion was harmless for that reason. We disagree. A physician is held to the \u201cstandard of care and skill of the average member of the medical profession practicing his specialty\u201d at the time of the alleged negligence. <em>Stepakoff v. Kantar, </em>393 Mass. 836, 841 (1985). Defense experts cannot be cross-examined about discoveries or other knowledge developed after the acts complained of. But in the circumstances here, they were not required to do so. As noted in the 1993 edition, the chart at issue was published in the American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology in 1987, three years prior to the defendant\u2019s alleged negligence. Williams, Obstetrics 1043 (19th ed. 1993). The same chart is contained in the earlier 1989 edition of Williams, Obstetrics. Compare Williams, Obstetrics Table 45-4, at 1040 (19th ed. 1993), with Williams, Obstetrics Table 15-4, at 294 (18th ed. 1989). Even if the chart had not been contained in the 1989 edition, the information contained in the chart printed in the 1993 edition was relevant to the opinion of the defense experts, rendered at trial in 1995, regarding whether fetal asphyxia caused Kaileigh\u2019s brain injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>D</p>\n<p id=\"b628-5\">We agree with the reasoning and conclusion of the Appeals Court that Brockton Hospital\u2019s written policies and procedures constitute inadmissible hearsay and did not come under any exception. <em>Brusard </em>v. <em>O\u2019Toole, supra </em>at 295. The judge properly excluded this evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-6\">The judgment is vacated and the case is remanded to the Superior Court for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b618-8\">Dr. O\u2019Toole testified that it is not unusual for a first-time mother to go beyond her estimated delivery date. However, over time the placenta, which provides oxygen and nutrients to the fetus, deteriorates, having an adverse impact on the health of the fetus. An oxytocin challenge test induces contractions in the mother and evaluates the response of the fetal heart in response to these contractions. An acceleration- of the fetal heartbeat to the stress of the contractions reassures the physician that the fetus is doing well despite the fact that the estimated due date has passed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b619-8\">The biophysical profile consists of an oxytocin challenge test and an ultrasound portion. On April 23, 1990, Dr. O\u2019Toole had ordered that the two be performed together. The ultrasound portion was not performed until April 24, apparently because of scheduling difficulties. To remain consistent with the terminology used by the parties and by the Appeals Court, we refer in this opinion to the ultrasound portion as the \u201cbiophysical profile.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b620-8\">The blood clots that each party theorizes caused Kaileigh\u2019s stroke or strokes differ. Brusard\u2019s expert testified that the clots were thrombi, which are clots attached to the arteries in the brain. The defendant maintained that the clots were emboli, clots that travel from one part of the body to another, that originated in the umbilical cord, traveled through Kaileigh\u2019s body, and ultimately blocked the arteries in her brain.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b621-10\">The comments of the Advisory Committee to Study the Rules of Evidence (July, 1980) on Proposed Mass.

Unlike <em>Bradford, </em>in this case Brusard was unsuccessful in the Appeals Court on the issue of the statutory exclusion, but prevailed in that court on the issue of the exclusion pursuant to proposed evidentiary rule 803 (18). She did not seek further appellate review. Dr. O\u2019Toole, who had prevailed at trial and in the Appeals Court on the issue of the exclusion under G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 79C, sought further appellate review on other issues. He argues here, as he did in the Appeals Court, that the decision of the trial judge to exclude the chart under G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 79C, was proper. Although Brusard was the losing party on that issue, we see no reason not to apply the general rule expressed in <em>Bradford </em>v. <em>Baystate Medical Ctr., supra, </em>that we may consider all issues that were before the Appeals Court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b626-7\">Under G.
