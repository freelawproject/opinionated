Represented by new counsel on appeal, the defendant claims error in (1) the denial of his motion to suppress certain eyewitness testimony; (2) certain jury instructions; (3) the admission of the testimony of a police officer that a nontestifying witness selected a photograph from a photographic array; and (4) remarks made by the prosecutor during his closing argument. We reject these arguments and discern no reason to exercise our authority pursuant to G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E, to order a new trial or reduce the jury\u2019s murder verdict. Accordingly, we affirm the defendant\u2019s convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">The jury were warranted in finding the following facts. On February 14, 1994, the defendant shot two men outside a pizza restaurant in Lynn. The first man died from gunshot wounds to his head and chest, and the second survived. The victims were among a large group of young people who were gathered inside and outside the restaurant. Five young men were standing together in front of the restaurant when they noticed the defendant across the street gesturing to them. They crossed the street, spoke to the defendant, and then went inside the restaurant. About two minutes later, the defendant entered the restaurant and gestured for one of the five men to follow him outside. The entire group went outside. Within seconds, the defendant pulled out a gun and pointed it at the group, then fired several shots, killing one victim, and wounding the second victim. The defendant fled, firing one last shot at the group as he retreated. He returned to his apartment where he was seen by a neighbor and his girl friend\u2019s sister, with whom he shared an apartment. He later sent his roommate to the police to learn what was happening.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-6\">The defendant was not apprehended for more than one year. According to the Commonwealth, on March 28, 1995, he telephoned one of the police investigators and told him that the police were \u201ctoo stupid to catch him\u201d and that he would \u201cbum [them] up in court.\u201d He was arrested in Boston two days later. Once in custody, the defendant gave statements to the police in which he acknowledged having clothing similar to the shooter\u2019s, owning a gun of the same caliber as the gun fired,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and being in the vicinity of the shootings when they occurred. At trial, the jury heard an audiotape and read the accompanying transcript <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>of both an edited version of his statement to police and the telephone call to the police two days prior to his arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-5\">The Commonwealth\u2019s case depended on the testimony of several witnesses who were in and around the restaurant that afternoon, some of whom later identified the defendant as the shooter from photographic arrays and lineups. Sean Duarte saw the defendant repeatedly on the day of the shootings. He was an eyewitness to the shootings, and later identified the defendant from a photographic array and at the grand jury lineup. Other witnesses saw the defendant at the restaurant, but did not see the shootings. Stephen Powell recognized the defendant when he saw him enter the restaurant because he had played basketball with him a couple of times. Powell later identified the defendant from a photographic array. Jadi Lin Graciale, like Powell, saw the defendant as he entered the restaurant to call the group outside. She also identified the defendant at the grand jury lineup. Corey Jordan saw the defendant from his seat in the restaurant, although Jordan could not conclusively identify the defendant in a photographic array or at the lineup. Other witnesses who were not at the restaurant saw the defendant that afternoon. These included Robert Jackson, a pedestrian who heard the shootings and then saw the defendant near the restaurant putting a gun \u201cinto his pants\u201d; Frances Teague, who heard the gunshots from her porch and then saw the defendant run past her home as he rushed from the shootings; Mary Sue Eaton, the defendant\u2019s roommate who observed his nervous behavior after he returned from the shootings and whom the defendant later forced to go to the police to find out \u201cwhat was going on\u201d; and Sophia Poe Turner and Arlene Robinson, the defendant\u2019s neighbors who saw the defendant just after the shootings.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">The police investigation focused on numerous suspects, including the defendant. The police prepared separate photographic arrays for four of the suspects. One array (GQ array) contained the photograph of a suspect known as \u201cGQ,\u201d and one contained the defendant\u2019s photograph (Hardaway [an alias] array). Investigators also created a flyer containing the defendant\u2019s photograph, which they obtained from a Lynn police department mugshot that was on file from an earlier, unrelated arrest. The flyer was intended for intradepartmental use only. Three days after the shootings, however, Bernard Robinson, a friend of the victims, obtained a copy of the flyer when he was in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>police station for an unrelated arrest. Robinson showed the flyer to several of the witnesses at the murder victim\u2019s wake and funeral. The Hardaway array and the flyer contained the same photograph.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">1. <em>Suppression of identification evidence. </em>The defendant moved to suppress the testimony of six witnesses, arguing that their testimony was tainted by exposure to the flyer. After an evidentiary hearing, the motion judge suppressed the testimony of one of the six contested witnesses. The defendant argues on appeal that the in-court and out-of-court identifications made by two of these witnesses, Duarte and Graciale, also should have been suppressed because they saw the flyer containing the defendant\u2019s photograph prior to making their identifications. The defendant urges us to conclude that viewing the flyer was unnecessarily suggestive, that the Commonwealth failed to demonstrate an independent basis for the identifications, and that admission of the identifications was prejudicial.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-6\">(a) <em>Duarte\u2019s identification. </em>On the day of the shootings, Duarte was among the group of five men, and witnessed a man gesture to them from across the street. Duarte crossed the street with the group and stood facing the man from about two feet away for about ten seconds. He saw him jogging away from the group moments later. He also saw the man enter the restaurant to call the group outside, just prior to the shootings, and stood outside facing him prior to, and during, the shootings. Soon after the shootings, Duarte gave the police a description of the shooter.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-7\">Duarte attended the victim\u2019s wake and funeral, where he first saw the flyer and noted that it \u201creally looks like\u201d the shooter. On February 20, 1994, Duarte picked GQ as the shooter from the GQ array. On March 9, 1994, after viewing the GQ and Hardaway arrays, he chose the defendant as the shooter and disavowed his earlier identification of GQ. In April, 1995, Duarte identified the defendant at a grand jury lineup.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-8\">(b) <em>Graciale\u2019s identification. </em>On the day of the shootings, Graciale saw a man enter the restaurant from a short distance away. She gave the police a description of him shortly afterward, and then viewed photographs at the police station without making an identification. At the victim\u2019s wake, she saw the defendant\u2019s photograph in the flyer and told Robinson that it was the man she saw on the day of. the shootings. Her only identification of the defendant took place at the grand jury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>lineup in April, 1995, fourteen months after she saw the flyer. The motion judge concluded that her identification of the defendant \u201cwas based solely upon her observations of him at [the restaurant], not from the brief period she had seen his picture on the flyer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b255-5\">(c) <em>Discussion. </em>Where a defendant alleges that witness identifications arise from unnecessarily suggestive circumstances, the \u201cdefendant has the burden to prove, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the witness was subjected by the State to a pretrial confrontation ... \u2018so unnecessarily suggestive and conducive to irreparable mistaken identification\u2019 as to deny the defendant due process of law.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Otsuki, </em>411 Mass. 218, 232 (1991), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Venios, </em>378 Mass. 24, 26-27 (1979). The judge, in considering whether identification testimony should be suppressed, must examine \u201cthe totality of the circumstances attending the confrontation to determine whether it was unnecessarily suggestive.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Otsuki, supra </em>at 232-233. If a defendant establishes that a confrontation was unnecessarily suggestive, then the identifications are excluded based on due process rights guaranteed by art. 12 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>420 Mass. 458, 462-465 (1995); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Botelho, </em>369 Mass. 860, 865-869 (1976). Subsequent identifications are admissible only if the Commonwealth demonstrates by clear and convincing evidence that the identifications have an independent source. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Johnson, supra </em>at 463, citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Botelho, supra </em>at 868.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-6\">Common-law principles of fairness are another basis to exclude witness identification testimony. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>423 Mass. 99, 109 (1996). In <em>Jones, </em>the witness saw the defendant only briefly at the time of the identification. Prior to the identification and without assistance from the Commonwealth, the witness saw the defendant shackled to a co-defendant in court for more than one hour. See <em>id. </em>at 102-103. We concluded that \u201c[c]ommon law principles of fairness dictate that an unreliable identification arising from the especially suggestive circumstances\u201d should be excluded. <em>Id. </em>at 109.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-7\">In this case, the motion judge properly concluded that due process does not require suppression of the identifications because the defendant failed to demonstrate by a preponderance of the evidence that the circumstances surrounding the flyer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>were unnecessarily suggestive. Duarte\u2019s viewing of the flyer, which occurred at either the wake or the funeral, did not result from \u201cpolice contrivance or bungling.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 104 n.5. Where the suggestive circumstances do not arise from police activity, due process does not require exclusion of subsequent identification testimony. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Andrews, </em>427 Mass. 434, 438 (1998); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Otsuki, supra </em>at 234.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">Neither does a common-law notion of fairness weigh in favor of suppression. Indeed, in some circumstances an identification that has been tainted, but not by the government, may become so unreliable that its introduction into evidence is unfair. That did not happen here. Duarte saw the defendant multiple times, as the group gathered in front of the restaurant, as the defendant met the group face-to-face, and again from a short distance when the defendant shot the victims. Given his repeated opportunities to see the defendant, there is nothing unfair about Duarte identifying the defendant from a photographic array and at the grand jury lineup after he saw the defendant\u2019s photograph in the flyer.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-6\">We reach the same conclusion on the admission of Graciale\u2019s identification. Due process does not require suppression of her testimony because, as with Duarte\u2019s identification, Graciale\u2019s viewing of the flyer did not result from police activity. Nor is there a common-law basis to exclude her identification of the defendant at the grand jury lineup because whatever impact the flyer may have had was minimized because the lineup occurred more than fourteen months after she viewed the flyer.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-7\">The jury were in a position to make an informed assessment of whether the identifications were right or wrong because both Duarte and Graciale were subject to extensive and thorough cross-examination at trial as to their identifications.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> \u201cThe degree of suggestiveness present in [these] identification[s] went to the weight, not the admissibility, of this evidence and it is for the jury to assess the infirmities of [these] identification[s].\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Melvin, </em>399 Mass. 201, 208 (1987), and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-8\">2. <em>Jury instructions. </em>The defendant argues that the judge erred by refusing to give the jury an instruction on the possibil<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>ity that the witnesses made a good faith error in identifying him. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pressley, </em>390 Mass. 617, 620 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">We remain convinced of the importance of. a <em>Pressley </em>instruction. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rosado, </em>428 Mass. 76, 78-79 (1998) (reaffirming importance of <em>Pressley </em>instruction); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ashley, </em>427 Mass. 620, 628-629 (1998) (same); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jones, supra </em>at 110 (same). \u201cFairness to a defendant compels the trial judge to give an instruction on the possibility of an honest but mistaken identification when the facts permit it and when the defendant requests it.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pressley, supra. </em>The instruction was requested by the defendant and was appropriate here. Mistaken identification was part of the defendant\u2019s case, and was argued to the jury in his opening and closing arguments. The judge, therefore, erred by not providing the requested instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-6\">When a judge ignores the defendant\u2019s request for a good faith error instruction, the question is whether the omission prejudiced the defendant. As we recently noted, \u201cthe error in omitting the <em>Presslery </em>instruction may on occasion, like any error, be nonprejudicial.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rosado, supra </em>at 79 n.1. Omitting the requested instruction is \u201cnonprejudicial only if the Commonwealth can convince us with \u2018fair assurance\u2019 that that failure did not \u2018substantially sway[]\u2019 the outcome of the case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 80, quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Flebotte, </em>417 Mass. 348, 353 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b257-7\">Failure to provide a good faith instruction in a capital case also must be examined under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ruddock, </em>428 Mass. 288, 292 n.3 (1998). Where an error in a jury instruction exists, \u201ca new trial is called for unless we are substantially confident that, if the error had not been made, the jury verdict would have been the same.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b257-8\">In this case, we see neither prejudicial error nor a substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice arising from the omission. Given the overwhelming evidence against the defendant, including nine witnesses who saw the defendant before, during, and after the shootings, who identified the defendant during the police investigation, and many of whom testified against him at trial, and the defendant\u2019s own statements concerning his gun, his clothing, and his whereabouts on the day of the shootings, we are convinced that the jury would not have reached a different result even if they had received a good faith instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>3. <em>Admissibility of police investigator\u2019s testimony. </em>At trial, a State police investigator testified on cross-examination that Ronald Johnson, an eyewitness who asserted his right not to testify at trial, identified GQ as the shooter from the GQ array. On redirect examination, the prosecutor attempted to show that Johnson made another subsequent identification of the defendant from a different array. The defendant objected on the ground that the testimony was outside the scope of redirect examination. In response to the objection, the judge prohibited the investigator from testifying as to whom Johnson selected, and only allowed the witness to acknowledge that another identification had been made.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">The defendant alleges that admission of this testimony violated his rights to confrontation and cross-examination under both the State and Federal Constitutions. We disagree. The judge properly limited the testimony to protect the defendant\u2019s rights. \u201cThe defendant\u2019s right of confrontation requires the physical presence of a witness testifying against him, the witness\u2019s testimony to be under oath, the defendant\u2019s opportunity to cross examine the witness, and the jury\u2019s opportunity to observe the witness\u2019s demeanor.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sanchez, </em>423 Mass. 591, 596 (1996). The defendant had full opportunity to cross-examine the investigator and vigorously oppose and refute his testimony, as evidenced by his objection that significantly limited the testimony. See <em>Mendonza </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>423 Mass. 771, 785 (1996) (art. 12 and Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution \u201conly grant[] the right to a defendant in a criminal proceeding to confront the witness offering the declaration\u201d). The defendant was not harmed because the investigator only testified about his own observation, not about the substance of Johnson\u2019s identification.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-6\">4. <em>The prosecutor\u2019s closing statement. </em>The defendant argues that the prosecutor in his closing statement improperly referred to facts not in evidence and misstated the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-7\">The defendant argues the prosecutor misstated the evidence when he said that Johnson had identified the defendant from the photographic array. As discussed above, the testimony at trial only established that Johnson made an identification, not whom he identified. In the challenged portion of the closing statement, the prosecutor discussed how the police learned about the suspect, GQ, and how the police compiled an array showing GQ. He stated: \u201c[The police investigators] take this GQ and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>what do they do? They do as they should. They put together arrays and follow up on it. Yeah, they get ID\u2019s. Not one person has said that\u2019s the guy. Sean Duarte, six out of ten he says. Ronald Johnson says it was him. Remember the testimony. Ronald Johnson looks at two arrays on the fifth, GQ, and says: \u2018Looks like him.\u2019 Then he is shown the Carl Hardaway array, and that is in evidence. He makes an ID.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">These remarks were not improper because the record shows that the prosecutor\u2019s intended reference to \u201chim\u201d was to GQ, not the defendant. The prosecutor\u2019s statements concerning Johnson, when viewed in context, accurately reflected the evidence admitted as part of the police investigator\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-6\">The defendant also argues that the prosecutor improperly discussed Thomas\u2019s identification, which had been suppressed, and made three specific comments which amounted to either exaggerations or misleading insinuations. The prosecutor noted Powell\u2019s reluctance to testify, stated that the shootings were about \u201cdisrespect,\u201d and commented that another witness had difficulty identifying the defendant because the defendant \u201ctook off.\u201d The defendant did not object to any of these four statements at trial or ask for curative instructions. Our review, therefore, is limited to whether there was a substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>427 Mass. 336, 354 (1998), and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-7\">Viewed under this standard, which requires us to examine the cumulative effect of the statements, see <em>id. </em>at 351, none of the defendant\u2019s claims warrants reversal or a new trial. The comments concerning Thomas were limited properly \u201cto the evidence and fair inferences that can be drawn from the evidence,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pearce, </em>427 Mass. 642, 646 (1998), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kelly, </em>417 Mass. 266, 270 (1994), because the prosecutor referred to Thomas\u2019s trial testimony, not her previously suppressed identification.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The other comments were grounded on the evidence and were within the range of rhetoric and \u201cexcusable hyperbole\u201d available to either side in closing argument. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sanna, </em>424 Mass. 92, 107 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b259-8\">5. <em>Review under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E. </em>The defendant argues that, even if individual errors in his trial were not substantial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>enough to warrant reversal, the combination of errors indicates that a new trial is required. We disagree. The defendant\u2019s murder conviction, in our opinion, is supported by overwhelming evidence. We have reviewed the entire record on both the law and the facts, and we see no basis for granting a new trial or reducing the murder verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">\n<em>Judgments affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b252-7\">The murder weapon was never found.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b256-9\">Defense counsel aggressively attempted to undermine both the credibility of Duarte and Graciale and the reliability of their identifications.
