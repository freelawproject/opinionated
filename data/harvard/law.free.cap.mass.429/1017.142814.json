Moore (petitioner)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> commenced in the Superior Court a civil action seeking declaratory and injunctive relief against the Commissioner of Correction and the superintendent of the Massachusetts Correctional Institution at Cedar Junction (defendants). The petitioner, asserting that he was indigent pursuant to G. L. c. 261, \u00a7 27B, requested a waiver of the filing fee, which was approved. Subsequently, the defendants moved to vacate that order on the ground that the petitioner\u2019s prison account records indicated that he had sufficient funds with which he could pay the filing fee. The judge allowed the defendants\u2019 motion to vacate; ordered the petitioner to pay the filing fee within thirty days, failing which the case would be dismissed without prejudice; and stayed proceedings pending his full payment of the fee.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-12\">In accordance with G. L. c. 261, \u00a7 27D, the petitioner appealed to a single justice of the Appeals Court, who affirmed the Superior Court judge\u2019s order. Subsequently, the petitioner filed in the county court a petition under G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 3, through which he sought an order requiring \u201cthe Superior Court to grant his request for waiver of filing fees [szc] pursuant to G. L. c. 261 [,] \u00a7 27C, and accept his complaint for filing.\u201d A single justice of this court denied the petition, and the petitioner appealed. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-13\">General Laws c. 261, \u00a7 27D, provides that an appeal from a Superior Court judge\u2019s denial of a request for a fee waiver shall be to a single justice of the Appeals Court, whose \u201cdecision shall be final with respect to such request.\u201d \u201cRarely should we employ our superintendence power to review rulings in matters in which the Legislature has expressly stated that the decision of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1018\">*1018</page-number>another court or judge \u2018shall be final.\u2019 \u201d <em>Hurley </em>v. <em>Superior Court Dep\u2019t of the Trial Court, </em>424 Mass. 1008, 1009 (1997). We have repeatedly declined to review a decision of a single justice of the Appeals Court affirming a trial judge\u2019s denial of a motion for funds or for a waiver of fees. <em>Longval </em>v. <em>Superior Court Dep\u2019t of the Trial </em>Court, 426 Mass. 1008 (1998). <em>Hurley </em>v. <em>Superior Court Dep\u2019t of the Trial Court, supra. Gos </em>v. <em>Brownstein, </em>403 Mass. 252, 254 (1988). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pope, </em>392 Mass. 493, 502 (1984). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lockley, </em>381 Mass. 156, 159-160 (1980).</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b926-8\"><em>Nancy Ankers White, </em>Special Assistant Attorney General, <em>&amp; William D. Saltzman </em>for the Superior Court Department of the Trial Court.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"ACx\"><em>William H. Moore, </em>pro se.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b926-5\">The petitioner contends that relief under c. 211, \u00a7 3, is nevertheless appropriate because the denial of his request for a waiver of the filing fee \u201cdeprived [him] of his constitutional right to access the court.\u201d Contrary to his claim, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Swist, </em>38 Mass. App. Ct. 907 (1995), does not support his argument that our review of the decision of the single justice of the Appeals Court is warranted in this case. In <em>Swist, </em>the defendant appealed from the partial denial of his request for transcripts to assist him in preparing a motion for a new trial. <em>Id. </em>at 908. The Appeals Court held that the order denying the defendant\u2019s request was interlocutory and, therefore, \u201cnot immediately appealable,\u201d but that relief might be obtained from a single justice of this court. <em>Id. Swist </em>is distinguishable from this case because a request for funds for the purpose of preparing a motion for a new trial is generally \u201cnot cognizable under G. L. c. 261, \u00a7 27C.\u201d <em>Id. </em>See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>410 Mass. 680, 684 (1991). Here, however, c. 261, \u00a7\u00a7 27C and 27D, expressly govern the matter. Thus, the petitioner\u2019s argument is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b926-7\">The case was submitted on briefs.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b925-14\">Although a second plaintiff was named in the complaint, he subsequently filed a motion for voluntary dismissal and he has not participated in the appeal. Accordingly, we refer only to the petitioner.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
