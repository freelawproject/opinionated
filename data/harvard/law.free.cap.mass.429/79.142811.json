L. c. 63, \u00a7 31 A, where its operations within the Commonwealth are not primarily agricultural. The Appellate Tax Board (board) ruled that the corporation is entitled to the credit. The board concluded that the \u00a7 31A credit is available to those businesses which are \u201cprimarily engaged in agriculture\u201d and own property situated within the Commonwealth, whether or not the business activity they conduct within the Commonwealth is agricultural. The Commissioner of Revenue (commissioner) appealed and we transferred the case to this court on our own motion. The commissioner argues that \u00a7 31A is only intended to apply to corporations whose primary business within the Commonwealth <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>is agriculture.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We hold that the board\u2019s conclusion is supported by the clear language of G. L. c. 63, \u00a7 31 A, and, accordingly, affirm its ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-5\">1. <em>Background. </em>Cargill, Incorporated, is a Minnesota-based corporation that conducts business in the Commonwealth. The parties agree, and the board found, that during the tax years in question, 1986 through 1988, Cargill\u2019s business consisted primarily of the marketing and sale of agricultural products.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Cargill is also involved in nonagricultural businesses. During the relevant years, Cargill sold both agricultural and non-agricultural products within the Commonwealth. Cargill does not grow, produce, or process agricultural products in the Commonwealth. Cargill and the commissioner stipulated that Cargill\u2019s Northeast Petroleum division used the property, for which the tax credit was sought, principally for distribution of petroleum products.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-6\">Cargill timely filed its Massachusetts corporate excise tax returns for the years in question. In these returns, Cargill claimed the \u00a7 31A tax credits. The commissioner conducted an audit and determined that Cargill was not entitled to the credit because it is \u201cnot primarily based in agriculture in Massachusetts.\u201d The commissioner then assessed, and Cargill paid, an additional assessment due to the disallowance of the credit.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-7\">Cargill filed applications for abatement of the additional assessment. See G. L. c. 62C, \u00a7 37C. The abatement bureau (bureau) denied the applications, basing its denial on its determination that Cargill\u2019s business was not \u201cprimarily engaged in agriculture.\u201d The bureau did not base its decision on whether or not Cargill\u2019s activities within Massachusetts were primarily related to agriculture.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-8\">Cargill appealed to the board. See G. L. c. 62C, \u00a7 39. In its ruling, the board found that \u201cCargill is a \u2018corporation primarily engaged in agriculture\u2019 which owned and used property situated within the Commonwealth for purposes of G. L. c. 63, \u00a7 31A.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>The board further found that the commissioner\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 31 A, requiring that the corporation be engaged primarily in agriculture within Massachusetts, would \u201cengraft conditions and limitations onto the statutory provision which are simply not present in the plain language\u201d of the statute. Consequently, the board ruled that Cargill was entitled to the \u00a7 31A tax credit for the years in question.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The commissioner then filed a notice of appeal, see G. L. c. 58A, \u00a7 13, and we transferred the case to this court on our own motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">2. <em>Massachusetts corporate excise. </em>Massachusetts imposes an excise on all corporations \u201cdoing business\u201d' within the Commonwealth. See G. L. c. 63, \u00a7\u00a7 32, 39. The statutory provision central to the present dispute, G. L. c. 63, \u00a7 31 A, provides corporations an investment tax credit against the excise due. The relevant language of \u00a7 31A <em>(a) </em>states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b101-6\">\u201c[A] corporation primarily engaged in agriculture . . . shall be allowed a credit as hereinafter provided against its excise due under this chapter. The amount of such credit shall be one per cent of the cost or other basis for federal income tax purposes of qualifying tangible property acquired, constructed, reconstructed, or erected during the taxable year .... Qualifying property shall be tangible personal property and other tangible property including buildings and structural components of buildings acquired by purchase . . . used by the corporation in the commonwealth; situated in the commonwealth on the last day of the taxable year . . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b101-7\">3. <em>Discussion. </em>Decisions of the board are final as to findings of fact. See G. L. c. 58A, \u00a7 13. Consequently, \u201c[a] decision of the board will not be reversed or modified if it is based on substantial evidence and on a correct application of the law.\u201d <em>Koch </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue, </em>416 Mass. 540, 555 (1993). See <em>Commissioner of Revenue </em>v. <em>Houghton Mifflin Co., </em>423 Mass. 42, 43 (1996) (when reviewing a decision of the board, \u201cthe sole question before us is whether the board erred as a matter of law\u201d). The commissioner argues that the board committed an error of law by relying solely on the plain language of the statute because the statute is ambiguous. To reach the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>conclusion urged by the commissioner, we are asked to look beyond the clear language of the statute and infer an intention on the part of the Legislature to limit the credit to those corporations \u201cprimarily engaged in agriculture\u201d <em>within the Commonwealth. </em>Had the Legislature intended to limit the credit in the manner advocated by the commissioner, it easily could have done so.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">We have recently reiterated that \u201cwe are constrained to follow\u201d the plain language of a statute when its \u201clanguage is plain and unambiguous,\u201d and its application would not lead to an \u201cabsurd result,\u201d or contravene the Legislature\u2019s clear intent. <em>White </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>428 Mass. 250, 253 (1998). The first sentence of G. L. c. 63, \u00a7 31A <em>(a), </em>states quite clearly that \u201ca corporation primarily engaged in agriculture\u201d is entitled to the investment tax credit as set out in the statute. The credit is for investment in \u201cqualifying tangible property.\u201d In order to be \u201cqualifying tangible property\u201d under \u00a7 31A <em>(a), </em>the property must be \u201cused by the corporation in the commonwealth\u201d and be \u201csituated in the commonwealth on the last day of the taxable year.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The statute, however, does not require that the corporation\u2019s in-State property be used in agriculture. What the statute requires is that a corporation be \u201cprimarily engaged in agriculture\u201d and have qualifying property in Massachusetts. In effect, the commissioner asks us to add an additional requirement to the statute: that the corporation\u2019s <em>in-State </em>property be used primarily in agriculture. The statute, however, sets out no such requirement. Where, as here, the language of the statute is clear, it is the function of the judiciary to apply it, not amend it. See generally <em>King </em>v. <em>Viscoloid Co., </em>219 Mass. 420, 425 (1914) (\u201cwe have no right to . . . read into the statute a provision which the Legislature did not see fit to put there, whether the omission came from inadvertence or of set purpose\u201d). As the clear language of the statute does not support the commissioner\u2019s position, the board correctly ruled that Cargill was entitled to the investment tax credit for the years in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-6\">4. <em>Conclusion. </em>Because we conclude that G. L. c. 63, \u00a7 31 A, does not require that the agricultural activity be conducted within the Commonwealth, we need not reach the commerce <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>clause issue. The decision of the Appellate Tax Board is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b100-9\">Cargill, Incorporated, asserts that, if G. L. c. 63, \u00a7 31A, does require that it be primarily engaged in agriculture within the Commonwealth to be entitled to the investment tax credit, then that requirement violates the commerce clause of the United States Constitution.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b100-10\">The board specifically found that during these years, \u201cCargill\u2019s gross receipts from the sale and marketing of agricultural products ranged from seventy-four percent to ninety percent of its total gross receipts reported on its federal corporate income tax returns.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b101-8\">The abatements allowed by the board were as follows: 1986 abatement of $22,967; 1987 abatement of $55,535; 1988 abatement of $2,886.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b102-7\">The statute contains additional requirements which are unrelated to the present dispute.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
