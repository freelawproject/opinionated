At that time, the plaintiff, Rite Media, Inc. (Rite Media), had a lease with the Frumans pursuant to which Rite Media maintained a large billboard on the Fruman property. The billboard was approximately three and one-half stories high and supported by steel beams sunk into concrete footings. The Frumans and the Commonwealth settled the Frumans\u2019 damage claim arising from the taking. Rite Media did not settle its claims and alleged a claim for damages both for the taking of its leasehold interest <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"815\">*815</page-number>and for the value of its billboard. The taking, of course, terminated the lease. See <em>Newman </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>336 Mass. 444, 446 (1957).</p>\n<p id=\"b835-5\">The lease called for monthly payments of rent of $2,666.67 and was to expire on January 31, 1995, approximately eleven months after the taking. The lease further provided that all structures placed on the property were the lessee\u2019s trade fixtures, remained the property of the lessee, and could \u201cbe removed by the Lessee at any time prior to or within a reasonable time after the termination of this lease.\u201d In March, 1994, Rite Media and the Commonwealth entered into an agreement that permitted Rite Media to maintain its billboard on the premises for a monthly fee of $2,134, which was stated to be a fair market rental charge for the use and occupancy of the property. In December, 1994, the Commonwealth offered Rite Media approximately $23,430 as a business relocation expense in connection with the billboard. Rite Media continued to operate the billboard on the Commonwealth\u2019s property and to collect advertising income until April, 1995, when, following notice from the Commonwealth, Rite Media removed the billboard.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b835-6\">On cross motions for summary judgment, a Superior Court judge granted the Commonwealth\u2019s motion and dismissed the complaint. He ruled that, because the fee charged by the Commonwealth, which reflected the fair market value of the property, was less than the monthly rent the Frumans had charged, Rite Media sustained no damages as a result of the termination of its leasehold. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Petty Motor Co., </em>327 U.S. 372, 381 (1946); <em>John Hancock Mut. Life Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>United States, </em>155 F.2d 977, 978 (1st Cir. 1946); <em>Lakewood </em>v. <em>Queen City Realty Co., </em>166 Ohio St. 2d 249, 252 (1957). On appeal, Rite Media does not challenge the judge\u2019s denial of damages for the taking of its leasehold interest. It asserts, however, that it is entitled to compensation for the fair market value of the billboard.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-7\">The Appeals Court, in a memorandum and order pursuant to its rule 1:28, affirmed the judgment. See <em>Rite Media, Inc. </em>v. <em>Secretary of Mass. Highway Dep\u2019t, </em>44 Mass. App. Ct. 1124 (1998). It concluded that Rite Media was not entitled to compensation for the billboard because the summary judgment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"816\">*816</page-number>record made \u201cno showing of (1) a private right of action, (2) a taking, or (3) damages incurred,\u201d and it awarded double costs. The Appeals Court relied on <em>Newman </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, supra </em>at 446-448, in which we rejected a tenant\u2019s claim for compensation for improvements that it had made on leased property that the Commonwealth had taken by eminent domain, improvements that the tenant had the right to remove.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We granted Rite Media\u2019s application for further appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-5\">The general rule as to improvements on real estate seized by eminent domain is that \u201c[n]o separate item of damages [can] be recovered for the improvements, which are compensable only in so far as they enhance the value of the estate.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 447. See G. L. c. 79, \u00a7 13 (when property is taken, \u201cthe damages shall include the value of all structures upon such parcel so far as they enhance the value of the land\u201d). This is a rule of long standing in the Commonwealth. Thus, for this taking, the lessor landowners were entitled to the fair market value of their property, subject to whatever effect Rite Media\u2019s leasehold interest had on that value, and Rite Media was entitled to the fair market value, if any, of its leasehold interest. The sum of these two interests equals the fair market value of the entire interest in the real estate, for which the Commonwealth was fiable because of the taking. G. L. c. 79, \u00a7\u00a7 6, 12. There is no basis in the typical taking to award damages, additionally and separately, for structures on the property. To do so would require the taking authority to pay compensable damages exceeding the fair market value of the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-6\">In this case, in any event, the circumstances are different. The billboard was not taken by eminent domain because it was personal property for eminent domain purposes. \u201cWe have never adopted in this Commonwealth any rule that structures or improvements present at the time of the taking which were theretofore subject to removal by the lessee are in themselves an interest in real estate within G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 79.\u201d <em>Newman </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, supra </em>at 448. \u201cPersonal property\u201d for eminent domain purposes is defined, in part, in G. L. c. 79A, \u00a7 1, as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b837-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"817\">*817</page-number><em>\u201c(b) </em>in the case of a tenant, fixtures and equipment, and other property which may be characterized as real property under state or local law, but which the tenant may lawfully, and at his election, determines to move and for which the tenant is not compensated in the real property acquisition.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b837-5\">Rite Media acknowledges that the billboard was a tenant fixture and that, under its lease, it had the right to remove it. Rite Media has not been compensated for its billboard in the real property acquisition. Under the law of the Commonwealth, therefore, by definition, the billboard was personal property for eminent domain purposes, and the Commonwealth did not take it by eminent domain.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-6\">This record does not present the question whether Rite Media is entitled to compensation pursuant to the Highway Beautification Act (HBA) (23 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 131 et seq. [1994]) by reason of G. L. c. 81, \u00a7 7J (concerning relocation assistance), or G. L. c. 93D (concerning outdoor advertising adjacent to certain highway systems). When this action was commenced, the billboard had not been removed. Section 131(g) of the HBA refers to the payment of just compensation \u201cupon the <em>removal </em>of any outdoor advertising sign\u201d (emphasis added).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Rite Media\u2019s complaint does not allege a claim under the Federal Uniform Relocation Assistance and Real Property Acquisition Policies Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 4651-4655 (1994).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In any event, both Federal statutes provide for \u201cjust compensation,\u201d which presumes that there were damages and, in this case, there were none.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b835-8\">Steel beams and horizontal steel were disposed of. Panels and lights were saved. The record does not show the value of the salvaged property in relation to the cost of removing the billboard.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b836-7\">Rite Media\u2019s argument that the measure of damages discussed in <em>Newman </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>336 Mass. 444 (1957), is inconsistent with the views of the Supreme Court expressed in <em>Almota Farmers Elevator &amp; Warehouse Co. </em>v. <em>United States, </em>409 U.S. 470 (1973), is immaterial to Rite Media\u2019s claim that it is entitled to be compensated for the taking of the billboard.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b837-9\">The Commonwealth\u2019s offer of relocation funds and the agreement to permit Rite Media to continue to operate the billboard may well fulfil any obligation the Commonwealth has under the Highway Beautification Act.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b837-10\">The fact that the Commonwealth did not take the billboard casts substantial doubt on any claim that Rite Media might assert under this Federal law beyond those it has under State law.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b837-8\">Fried, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AW-\">(dissenting, with whom Lynch, J., joins). The court reaches a perfectly reasonable result. Unfortunately the conclusion that Rite Media is not entitled to damages for the taking of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"818\">*818</page-number>its billboard is foreclosed by <em>Almota Farmers Elevator &amp; Warehouse Co. </em>v. <em>United States, </em>409 U.S. 470, 476 (1973), in which the Supreme Court held that a tenant whose leasehold has been taken is entitled to compensation for fixtures, and that that compensation is to be calculated by the value of the fixtures assuming the leasehold had not been taken and might have been renewed. While I agree with the dissent in <em>Almota, supra </em>at 481-482 (Rehnquist, J., dissenting), that valuing the fixtures as if the leasehold would have been extended indefinitely is wrong and incompatible with <em>United States </em>v. <em>Petty Motor Co., </em>327 U.S. 372 (1946), which the <em>Almota </em>Court claimed it was retaining in effect, still it is not for this court, on a matter of Federal constitutional law, to disregard a controlling opinion \u2014 however weakly reasoned \u2014 of the United States Supreme Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-5\">Although <em>Almota </em>was the basis of Rite Media\u2019s appeal, the court dismisses it in a footnote, stating that it is \u201cimmaterial\u201d to the claim for compensation for the billboard. <em>Ante </em>at 816 n.3. That is all the explanation the court offers. Presumably the court thinks, <em>ante </em>at 816, that this is so by virtue of \u201c[t]he general rule [of long standing in the Commonwealth] as to improvements on real estate seized by eminent domain . . . that \u2018[n]o separate item of damages [can] be recovered for the improvements,\u2019 \u201d and by virtue of its argument later that, because the billboard was subject to removal, \u201c[u]nder the law of the Commonwealth ... the billboard was personal property for eminent domain purposes, and the Commonwealth did not take it by eminent domain.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 817. Whether this is a good doctrine or a bad doctrine, it is not a doctrine on which the court is entitled to rely. The Commonwealth and the court cannot avoid compensating Rite Media by claiming to take only the leasehold and permitting (or ordering) Rite Media to remove the billboard.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In <em>Almota, </em>the parties stipulated to the fact that the government had no need for the improvements placed on the land being taken, but the Court nonetheless found that the lessee need not settle merely for salvage value but was entitled to an award reflecting the value of the improvements in place beyond the lease term. <em>Almota, supra </em>at 471-472. <em>In Almota, </em>the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"819\">*819</page-number>Court stated that where a long-term tenant erects buildings or fixtures:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b839-5\">\u201cEven if the buildings or fixtures are attached to the real estate and would pass with a conveyance of the land, as between landlord and tenant they remain personal property . . . [and] may be removed by the tenant at any time during the continuation of the lease, provided such removal may be made without injury to the freehold. This mle, however, exists entirely for the protection of the tenant, and cannot be invoked by the condemnor. If the buildings or fixtures are attached to the real estate, they must be treated as real estate in determining the total award.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b839-6\"><em>Id. </em>at <em>All </em>n.5, quoting 4 P. Nichols, Eminent Domain \u00a7 13.121 [2] (3d rev. ed. 1971). In a matter of Federal law, which is what this takings claim depends on, a State court is not free to defeat a claim to compensation by preferring a State law definition of what constitutes compensable property, when that very definition has been rejected by the Supreme Court. The court likes the way the matter is dealt with in <em>Newman </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>336 Mass. 444, 448 (1957). I think I do too, but we may not apply it in a question of Federal law insofar as it has been overruled by the Supreme Court of the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-7\">I would remand the case for a determination of the value of Rite Media\u2019s billboard as measured by the <em>Almota </em>standard and adjusted for any salvage value Rite Media may have realized when it removed the billboard.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b838-6\">The Commonwealth\u2019s argument that only the land, not the billboard, was taken seems inconsistent with the order of taking, which stated that the Highway Department, acting on behalf of the Commonwealth, was taking \u201cin fee simple, the parcel [] of land . . . including all trees and structures located thereon.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b839-8\">The Commonwealth contends, and the court echoes the claim, that the fact that Rite Media incurred the expense of dismantling and removing the billboard is evidence that the parties believed that it remained the property of Rite Media even after the taking. The beliefs of the parties after the taking do not, however, have any bearing on the compensability of the interest. And even if such conduct were relevant, the conclusion that Rite Media thought that the billboard was not part of the taking cannot be drawn from its actions in removing the billboard. Rite Media only removed the billboard because it was told by the Commonwealth to do so and because the salvage value of the sign exceeded the cost of removal. In taking this action, Rite Media mitigated its damages by disassembling the billboard and recovering its salvage value. Had Rite Media not done as it was told, it would have (1) failed to mitigate its damages and (2) risked losing the salvage value of the billboard if legal action failed.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
