The Division of Medical Assistance is the Massachusetts regulatory agency responsible for administering the Medicaid program. G. L. c. 118E.

At issue in this case is whether, in calculating her \u201cpatient paid amount,\u201d a nursing home resident who has been adjudicated incompetent and for whom a legal guardian has been appointed, may deduct from her monthly income judicially approved guardianship expenses (attorney\u2019s fees and costs) as an allowance for \u201cnecessary . . . medical or remedial care recognized under state law.\u201d 130 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 506.220(E)(2)(a) (1993).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396a(r)(1)(A)(i) (1994); 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 435.725(c)(4)(ii). The fees were incurred in connection with a physician-certified guardianship proceeding, a prerequisite to the Massachusetts resident gaining access to the long-term care facility suitable to provide the medical and related care services she needed, and to implementing an appropriate physician-approved treatment plan for her.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">Katherine Rudow, an elderly woman, was faced with eviction from the nursing home in which she resided because she lacked the mental capacity to pay her bill or to apply for Medicaid. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>The nursing home notified Rudow and her family that she would be discharged. Rudow\u2019s medical condition required that she reside in a skilled nursing facility. Her physician certified that she was not mentally capable of consenting to medical care. On February 25, 1992, a judge in the Probate Court adjudicated Rudow to be incompetent and in need of a guardian. Attorney Martha T. Ramsey was appointed as her guardian. G. L. c. 201, \u00a7 6. Subsequently, a judge in the Probate Court ordered that Ramsey\u2019s fees be paid from Rudow\u2019s income.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> G. L. c. 201, \u00a7 16. Ramsey notified the division of the order and requested authorization to deduct guardianship expenses from Rudow\u2019s income in calculating Rudow\u2019s PPA. The division denied the request.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">The physician of Mary L. Perry, ninety-five years old at the time this action commenced in 1993, and hospitalized as a patient at Cape Cod Hospital in Hyannis, determined she required care in a long-term care facility. She was not, however, mentally capable of consenting to her discharge from the hospital, or of signing an admission contract at a long-term care facility. In addition she was mentally incapable of completing an application for Medicaid benefits essential to pay for her care.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> To obtain the medical care her physician ordered, it was necessary to appoint a guardian for Perry, and her physician so certified. On November 15, 1991, a judge in the Probate Court adjudicated Perry to be incompetent, and appointed her niece, Eileen Lopez, as her guardian. G. L. c. 201, \u00a7 6. Lopez, who lives in New York, retained Ramsey to represent Lopez and Perry in guardianship matters. Lopez did not seek payment of guardianship expenses for herself; she obtained an order from a judge in the Probate Court that Ramsey\u2019s fees be paid from Per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>ry\u2019s income.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> G. L. c. 201, \u00a7 16. Ramsey notified the division of the order and requested authorization to deduct guardianship expenses from Perry\u2019s income in calculating Perry\u2019s PPA. The division denied the request.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">Rudow and Perry appealed, and administrative \u201cfair hearings\u201d were held on January 8, 1993. In each case the welfare appeals referee concluded \u201cthat the attorney deserves to be paid for providing her services,\u201d but that a deduction from the income of the Medicaid recipient for those services was not allowable. Citing 130 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 506.220, the referee concluded that payment of the guardianship expenses should be made from the \u201cpersonal needs allowance\u201d (PNA) \u2014 sixty dollars a month \u2014 available to Rudow and Perry. 130 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7\u00a7 506.220(A)(1), 506.420.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Rudow and Perry sought judicial review pursuant to G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14, on April 21 and April 30, 1993, respectively. Their cases were consolidated. On May 31, 1996, a judge in the Superior Court concluded that the division\u2019s decision was erroneous. He ruled that the guardianship costs \u201cmust be considered medical or remedial and, subject to reasonable limits, must be allowed as a deduction from the plaintiffs\u2019] income to determine their PPAs.\u201d The judge remanded the case to the division\u2019s board of hearings for fiirther proceedings. Final judgment entered for Rudow and Perry on March 20, 1997. On May 7, 1997, the division took an appeal. We transferred the cases here on our own motion. We affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-6\">H</p>\n<p id=\"b241-7\">Medicaid provides medical assistance to low income persons <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>based on financial need. See Tarin v. <em>Commissioner of the Div. of Medical Assistance, </em>424 Mass. 743, 746 (1997); <em>Massachusetts Hosp. Ass\u2019n </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Welfare, </em>419 Mass. 644, 646 (1995). State participation in this public assistance program is voluntary, and those that choose to participate must submit, for Federal approval, a State Medicaid plan that complies with the Medicaid Act and its implementing regulations. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1396 et seq. In Massachusetts, long-term care services are available to persons eligible for Medicaid, and the costs of institutionalization are met by payments to the facility by the Medicaid recipient (where available) and by Medicaid. See 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 435.832(a). The division establishes the amount that the recipient is required to contribute, see note 3, <em>supra, </em>and the concomitant amount that Medicaid will pay on her behalf.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">In conformity with Federal requirements, 130 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 506.220 specifies the allowances that a long-term care Medicaid recipient may deduct from her income in calculating her PPA: (a) personal needs allowance; (b) spousal maintenance needs allowance; (c) a family maintenance needs allowance for qualified family members; (d) a home maintenance allowance; and (e) health-care coverage and incurred expenses. See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396a(q), (r); 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 435.832(c). This dispute concerns the allowance for \u201chealth-care coverage and other incurred expenses.\u201d \u201cIncurred expenses,\u201d in turn, are defined as those expenses that a Medicaid recipient incurred \u201cfor necessary medical and remedial care\u201d that are not payable by a third party. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396a(r)(1)(A). The \u201cnecessary medical and remedial care\u201d expenses include \u201cmedical or remedial care recognized under state law but not covered by the Medical Assistance Program.\u201d 130 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 506.220(E)(2)(a). See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396a(r)(1)(A)(ii). The question for decision is whether, as guardian for Rudow and Perry, Ramsey\u2019s court-sanctioned fees constitute \u201cnecessary . . . medical or remedial care recognized under state law.\u201d 130 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 506.220(E)(2)(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b242-6\">The judge in the Superior Court answered the question affirmatively. Observing that Rudow\u2019s and Perry\u2019s guardianship proceedings \u201cwere initiated for no other reason than to obtain medical treatment for the plaintiffs at a long-term care facility,\u201d he concluded that in the circumstances presented by these two Medicaid recipients, Ramsey\u2019s fees are allowable deductions. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>130 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 506.220(E). He reasoned that \u201cthe costs of guardianship must be characterized as \u2018necessary medical expenses\u2019 when they are required under the doctrine of informed consent and when needed to furnish medical treatment to a demented nursing home resident. . . . When legal fees and costs associated with guardianship are necessary in order to authorize any medical treatment for an incompetent person under Massachusetts law, they are medical expenses, and as such are properly deductible from the income of an institutionalized Medicaid recipient pursuant to [division] regulations at 130 [Code Mass. Regs.] 506.220.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">m</p>\n<p id=\"b243-6\">We review the decision of an administrative agency under G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14, to determine whether \u201cthe substantial rights of any party may have been prejudiced because the agency decision is . . . (c) [b]ased on an error of law\u201d or \u201c(g) [arbitrary or capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.\u201d G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14 (7). See <em>Tarin </em>v. <em>Commissioner of the Div. of Medical Assistance, supra </em>at 750. In doing so, we \u201cgive due weight to the experience, technical competence, and specialized knowledge of the agency, as well as to the discretionary authority conferred upon it.\u201d \u00a7 14 (7). We are not, however, bound to adhere to a position taken by the agency particularly where, as here, there are neither Federal nor State regulations directly addressing the issue. See <em>Haley </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Pub. Welfare, </em>394 Mass. 466, 473-474, 476 (1985). \u201cAbsent a properly promulgated regulation, \u2018to the extent that an agency determination involves a question of law, it is subject to de novo judicial review.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 476, quoting <em>Raytheon Co. </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Sec., </em>364 Mass. 593, 595 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b243-7\">The doctrine of \u201cinformed consent\u201d \u2014 the requirement that a medical provider obtain the consent of a fully informed patient before administering treatment to that patient \u2014 has long been part of Massachusetts law. See, e.g., <em>Harnish </em>v. <em>Children\u2019s Hosp. Medical Ctr., </em>387 Mass. 152, 154 (1982), citing <em>Superintendent of Belchertown State Sch. </em>v. <em>Saikewicz, </em>373 Mass. 728, 738-739 (1977); <em>Matter of Spring, </em>380 Mass. 629, 634, 637-638 (1980). Only a competent person may give informed consent for medical care. See <em>Harnish </em>v. <em>Children\u2019s Hosp. Medical Ctr., supra </em>at 154-155. For this reason Mas<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>sachusetts law also has long recognized that, where a patient\u2019s cognitive impairments call into question her ability to make treatment decisions, medical treatment may not be administered without adequate and judicially supervised protection. See G. L. c. 201, \u00a7 6.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> See also <em>Matter of Spring, supra </em>at 638 (\u201ca duly appointed guardian of the person may give effective consent for the ward to undergo whatever medical treatment the guardian believes will be in the ward\u2019s best interest,\u201d citing Rep. A.G., Pub. Doc. No. 12, at 247-248 [1966]; <em>Rogers </em>v. <em>Okin, </em>478 F. Supp. 1342, 1362-1364 [D. Mass. 1979]). In <em>Rogers </em>v. <em>Commissioner of the Dep\u2019t of Mental Health, </em>390 Mass. 489 (1983), we held that, whenever a medical provider seeks to administer antipsychotic medication to a patient who is incapable of consenting to medical treatment, judicial protection of the patient\u2019s rights is mandated. A judge must first determine whether the patient is incompetent. <em>Id. </em>at 498. If so, a judge then decides, \u201c \u2018that which would be made by the incompetent person, if that person were competent\u2019 . . . and giving \u2018the fullest possible expression to the character and circumstances of that individual.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 500, quoting <em>Superintendent of Belchertown State Sch. </em>v. <em>Saikewicz, supra </em>at 752-753, 747. A guardian thereafter monitors the patient\u2019s treatment \u201cto ensure that the substituted-judgment treatment plan is followed.\u201d <em>Rogers </em>v. <em>Commissioner of the Dep\u2019t of Mental Health, supra </em>at 504. The requirement that a guardian be appointed to act on behalf of an incompetent person who requires necessary medical treatment is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>therefore an integral part of the law in Massachusetts concerning medical treatment for incompetent patients. G. L. c. 201, \u00a7 6. See <em>Guardianship of Weedon, </em>409 Mass. 196, 202 (1991); <em>Rogers </em>v. <em>Commissioner of the Dep\u2019t of Mental Health, supra </em>at 504; <em>Matter of Spring, supra </em>at 638; <em>Superintendent of Belchertown State Sch. </em>v. <em>Saikewicz, supra </em>at 739-740.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">While our decision in <em>Rogers </em>concerned the rights of involuntarily committed mental patients, it rested on our recognition that all patients have a fundamental right to participate in treatment decisions and that where they are incompetent to do so, that is where they are \u201cincapable of taking care of [themselves] by reason of mental illness,\u201d G. L. c. 201, \u00a7 6, a guardian may be appointed to protect those rights. In <em>Rogers, </em>we specifically rejected the argument that a patient\u2019s physician \u201cshould be responsible for making treatment decisions for involuntarily committed patients, whether competent or not.\u201d <em>Rogers </em>v. <em>Commissioner of the Dep\u2019t of Mental Health, supra </em>at 497. The inability of incompetent long-term care patients to pay for guardians may interfere not only with medical treatment but with access to an appropriate medical facility. Indeed, Perry was unable to be transferred to an appropriate medical facility without her consent. Where patients \u2014 like Rudow and Perry \u2014 are incapable of making their own treatment decisions, court intervention is mandated. <em>Id. </em>at 501. See <em>Matter of Spring, supra </em>at 637-638.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-6\">In the intervening years since <em>Rogers, </em>guardians increasingly have played a significant role in the care and treatment of those patients. The Massachusetts doctrines of informed consent, <em>Harnish </em>v. <em>Children\u2019s Hosp. Medical Ctr., supra </em>at 154-155, and substituted judgment, <em>Rogers </em>v. <em>Commissioner of the Dep \u2019t of Mental Health, supra </em>at 504, did not, of course, develop in the context of an aging population requiring long-term institutionalized care. The vulnerability of that population is now recognized, and both Federal and State law have recognized the need for special legal protections, primarily by regulatory oversight of long-term care nursing facilities. See Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1987, Pub. L. 100-203, \u00a7\u00a7 4201-4206, 4211-4218, 101 Stat. 1330-160 (OBRA 1987); 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395i-3 (Medicare) &amp; \u00a7 1396r (Medicaid).</p>\n<p id=\"b245-7\">Federal regulations implementing OBRA require that \u201c[i]n the case of a resident adjudged incompetent under the laws of a State by a court of competent jurisdiction, the rights of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>resident are exercised by the person appointed under State law to act on the resident\u2019s behalf.\u201d 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 483.10(a)(3). Those rights are extensive. OBRA regulations, for example, require the participation by an incompetent patient\u2019s legal representative in all treatment decisions. See, e.g., 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 483.20(d)(2)(ii) (patient assessments by interdisciplinary team must involve \u201cparticipation of the resident, the resident\u2019s family or the resident\u2019s legal representative\u201d). The Massachusetts Attorney General similarly has promulgated regulations that require a long-term care resident\u2019s legal representative to participate in the care, treatment planning, and decision making where a resident has been adjudicated incompetent.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> 940 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 4.08(3). See 940 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 4.08(13) (notice to incompetent patient\u2019s legal representative regarding significant changes in resident\u2019s condition); 940 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 4.09(6) (same regarding transfer and discharge issues).</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">For both Rudow and Perry, a physician certified that they were incompetent to consent to medical treatment. Without a court-appointed guardian, neither patient would have been able to obtain necessary and appropriate medical treatment. Their guardians also achieved a more efficient delivery of medical care. In these circumstances, the expenses incurred by guardians are \u201cnecessary . . . medical or remedial care\u201d expenses \u201crecognized under state law.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> 130 Code Mass. Regs. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>\u00a7 506.220(E)(2)(a).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">The division\u2019s resistance to this interpretation warrants comment.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> It insists that treating medically required guardianship expenses as a permissible allowance (\u201cincurred expense\u201d) conflicts with the Health Care Financing Administration\u2019s (HCFA\u2019s) policy interpretation of the cognate Federal statute and implementing regulations.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> It complains that, in reviewing the division\u2019s denials of the deductions, the judge did not give appropriate deference to HCFA. HCFA has not promulgated regulations specifically addressing the issue. The division points to correspondence between the Attorney General for the Commonwealth and HCFA,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> and to HCFA\u2019s refusal in 1987 to ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>prove an amendment to the Missouri State Medicaid plan,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> as indicative of HCFA\u2019s interpretation of applicable Federal law. While the division must comply with regulations promulgated by HCFA, G. L. c. 118E, \u00a7 9, HCFA\u2019s policy in the absence of a regulation is not compelling. \u201cAlthough \u2018an administrative interpretation of a statute is accorded deference,\u2019 <em>Rock </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Comm\u2019n Against Discrimination, </em>384 Mass. 198, 204 (1981), quoting <em>School Comm. of Wellesley </em>v. <em>Labor Relations Comm\u2019n, </em>376 Mass. 112, 116 (1978), interpretative rule making is not controlling upon the courts, <em>Daughters of Miriam Center for the Aged </em>v. <em>Mathews, 590 </em>F.2d 1250, 1258 (3d Cir. 1978).\u201d <em>Haley </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Pub. Welfare, supra </em>at 473. HCFA\u2019s denial of the Missouri State plan proposed amendment and the letter to the Attorney General of the Commonwealth at best \u201care simply interpretive rules.\u201d <em>Id., </em>quoting <em>Colorado Dep\u2019t of Social Servs. </em>v. <em>Department of Health &amp; Human Servs., </em>558 F. Supp. 337, 352 (D. Colo. 1983). We do not consider ourselves bound by HCFA\u2019s policy position particularly where, as here, we conclude that position conflicts with the controlling Federal statutory scheme.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">We also are not persuaded that the appropriate resolution of this issue is legislative rather than judicial. The division suggests that the Commonwealth could enact legislation increasing the personal needs allowance (PNA) for Medicaid recipients who require court-appointed guardians to obtain necessary medical treatment. The PNA is to allow long-term care residents to retain a modest amount of income for small items of a truly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>personal nature. The PNA must be \u201creasonable in amount for clothing and other personal needs of the individual (or couple) while in an institution.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396a(q)(1)(A)(i). Federal law requires the PNA to be not less than, although it may be more than, thirty dollars per month for an institutionalized individual and sixty dollars per month for an institutionalized couple. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396a(q). The contemporaneous House Conference Committee Report states that the PNA was \u201cintended to cover the cost of personal needs, such as toiletries and other small items, that are not covered by Medicaid.\u201d H.R. Conf. Rep. No. 100-495, 100th Cong., 1st Sess. 834, reprinted in 1987 U.S.C.C.A.N. 2313-1580. The Secretary\u2019s understanding of the items and services that may be charged to a resident\u2019s PNA are set out in the margin.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The items are not analogous to guardianship expenses necessitated by the incapacity of a nursing home resident to consent to her own medically necessary treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">Corresponding Massachusetts legislation exhibits the same legislative intent concerning the PNA. General Laws c. 118E, \u00a7 15, provides that a Medicaid recipient \u201cshall retain the first sixty dollars of monthly income for clothing, personal needs allowance, and leisure time activities.\u201d The legislation does not contemplate the payment of medically necessary guardianship expenses as part of a Medicaid recipient\u2019s personal needs allowance.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b249-7\">The division\u2019s denial of the request by Rudow and Perry to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>recognize their guardianship costs as \u201cnecessary medical and remedial care\u201d expenses deductible for purposes of calculating their PPA is \u201c[b]ased upon an error of law\u201d and \u201cnot in accordance with law.\u201d G.

Deductions from a recipient\u2019s income are mandated only in circumstances where a guardian is essential for an incompetent Medicaid recipient to gain access to or consent to medical treatment. The division may set reasonable limits on such expenses in conformity with 130 Code Mass.

G. L. c. 201, \u00a7 16. The division does not suggest otherwise. The judge also ordered that Ramsey report the time spent on Rudow\u2019s legal affairs on Ramsey\u2019s annual fiduciary accounts.

Regs. \u00a7 506.220(A)(1). Title 130 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 506.420, in turn, specifies that in long-term care cases the \u201cincome standard\u201d is sixty dollars each month. See 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 435.832(c)(1) (defining \u201cpersonal needs allowance\u201d as an \u201callowance that is reasonable in amount for clothing and other personal needs of the individual while in the institution\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b244-5\">The division suggests that G. L. c. 201, \u00a7 6, concerning the appointment of guardians of \u201cmentally ill\u201d persons may not be applicable to this case. Paragraph (a) of that section requires a judge to appoint a guardian of a person and her estate \u201cif, after notice . . . and a hearing, the court finds that [she] is incapable of taking care of [herself] by reason of mental illness.\u201d The division says there is nothing in the record to indicate that Rudow and Perry are \u201cmentally ill.\u201d The claim is extraordinary. On November 15, 1991, a judge in the Probate Court appointed a guardian for Perry on a petition under G. L. c. 201, \u00a7 6 (\u201cguardianship mentally ill\u201d). On February 25, 1992, a judge in the Probate Court approved a similar \u201cguardianship mentally ill\u201d petition for Rudow. In <em>Fazio </em>v. <em>Fazio, </em>375 Mass. 394, 403 (1978) we thought \u201cit reasonable to interpret the statutory phrase \u2018incapable of taking care of himself by reason of mental illness,\u2019 as encompassing a general inability on the part of an individual to manage his own person and financial affairs, such inability being caused by mental illness. We think the type of evidence necessary to support such a finding, apart from evidence as to mental illness, should consist of facts showing a proposed ward\u2019s inability to think or act for himself as to matters concerning his personal health, safety, and general welfare, or to make informed decisions as to his property or financial interests.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b246-6\">The Attorney General promulgated 940 Code Mass.

The regulations define certain unfair or deceptive acts or practices, and are \u201cdesigned to promote the protection, comfort, health and well-being of consumers of services provided by long-term care facilities, to be consistent with existing legal standards, and to be as responsive as possible to the constraints and administrative realities under which long term care facilities operate.\u201d 940 Code Mass.

If, after taking the allowable income deductions, a patient\u2019s monthly income is still too high to qualify her for Medicaid, the division will establish a six-month deductible. 130 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7\u00a7 520.026-520.028. If an applicant meets this deductible, she then will be eligible for Medicaid. 130 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 520.034. Title 130 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 520.031(A)(2) describes \u201callowable . . . remedial care-expense[s]\u201d for the purpose of meeting the long-term care deductible. The regulation states, in relevant part: \u201cA remedial-care expense is a nonmedical support service made necessary by the medical condition of the individual or the spouse.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Guardianship is a nonmedical support service, made necessary by the mental incapacity of the Medicaid recipient to consent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>to medical care. See <em>id. </em>We see no reason why we should consider any differently the definition of remedial care expenses for the purpose of meeting the long-term care deductible than we do for considering an income deduction.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b247-7\">The judge in the Superior Court also concluded, correctly, that the guardianship expenses were \u201cnot payable by a third party,\u201d 130 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 506.220(E)(2)(a), and \u201cnot covered by the Medical Assistance Program.\u201d <em>Id. </em>He also concluded that the expenses satisfied the reasonable limits set forth in 130 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 506.220(E)(2)(b) because they are \u201c(i) not already covered by the Medicaid per diem rate paid to the long-term-care facility; and (ii) certified by a treating physician or other medical provider as being medically necessary.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b247-8\">The division, apparently, has not been consistent in its interpretation of 130 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 506.220(E)(2), as it pertains to guardian fees and costs for incompetent patients of long-term care nursing facilities, and previously has allowed those fees and costs as \u201cincurred expenses\u201d within the meaning of that regulation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b247-9\">The Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA), a subsidiary of the United States Department of Health and Human Services, is the Federal agency charged with administering the Medicaid program and promulgating its implementing regulations. <em>Visiting Nurse Ass\u2019n of the N.

HCFA responded that \u201c[ajlthough various medical evaluations, certifications, and data are required as part of the process of appointing a <em>Rogers </em>[v. <em>Commissioner of the Dep\u2019t of Mental Health, </em>390 Mass. 489 (1983)] guardian, appointment of a guardian is nevertheless a legal proceeding. . . .

First, in support of its position HCFA observed that \u201c[gjuardianship services do not require medical expertise and do not serve medical purposes in the sense that the administration of pharmaceuticals or surgery do.\u201d In Massachusetts, of course, medical expertise is a necessary prerequisite for the appointment of a guardian pursuant to G. L. c. 201, \u00a7 6. Second, HCFA suggested that for \u201ctax purposes\u201d guardianship-related items would not be included in the \u201cbroad category of deductible medical expenses\u201d recognized under the law of Federal taxation. The law is to the contrary. See, e.g., <em>Gerstacker </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue, </em>414 F.2d 448 (6th Cir. 1969); Rev.
