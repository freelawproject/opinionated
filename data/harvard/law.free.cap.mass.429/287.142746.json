They were convicted in the District Court of taking soft-shell clams in violation of the shellfish regulations of the town of Bourne (town). After a timely appeal, the Appeals Court reversed and entered judgments for the defendants. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>45 Mass. App. Ct. 49 (1998). We granted the Commonwealth\u2019s application for further appellate review, and reverse the judgment of the District Court, but for slightly different reasons from those given by the Appeals Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-5\">The District Court judge found that, on Wednesday, July 5, 1995, the defendants were on a town beach collecting clams for personal consumption. The defendants were cited for taking shellfish without a permit<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and for taking soft-shell clams on a day prohibited by local regulations for recreational shellfishing. The parties agree, and the judge found, that the defendants enjoy tribal status as Wampanoag Indians.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-6\">The judge ruled that the defendants violated \u00a7 II 2.2 of the Bourne shellfish regulations.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The defendants maintain, inter alia, that this regulation cannot be lawfully applied to them in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>this instance because they were exercising their aboriginal rights to fish.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">The defendants cite a long history evidencing legislative and executive recognition of their aboriginal right to shellfish for sustenance. See, e.g., St. 1795, c. 71, \u00a7 5 (\u201cProvided that nothing in this act shall extend to deprive any native Indians of the privilege of digging shell fish for their own consumption . . .\u201d), repealed and codified at Rev. St. (1836), c. 55, \u00a7 15; St. 1933, c. 329, \u00a7 50 (\u201cany native Indian without a permit, may . . . take for his own family use, from the waters of any city or town, eels, soft-shelled clams\u201d); Executive Order No. 126 (July 8, 1976) (noting that Commonwealth has, for over three centuries, maintained an unceasing \u201cspecial relationship with the Native American people of the region,\u201d and ordering that \u201cState agencies shall deal directly with\u201d appropriate tribal council on matters affecting the Mashpee, Gay Head Wampanoag and other Wampanoag, and Nipmuc Indians); 1982 House Resolutions recognizing and protecting the ancient and aboriginal claim of the Indians of the Commonwealth (adopted November 9, 1982) (recognizing aboriginal claims of Indians within Commonwealth to hunt and to fish for sustenance).</p>\n<p id=\"b310-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>The governing statute, G. L. c. 130, \u00a7 52, provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b310-5\">\u201cThe selectmen of a town bordering upon coastal waters, if so authorized by their town, and the board of aldermen or the city council of any city so situated may control, regulate or prohibit the taking of eels and any or all kinds of shellfish and sea worms within such cities and towns and may, from time to time, without other or special authority therefor, make any regulations <em>not contrary to law </em>in regard to said fisheries as they deem expedient, including the times, places, methods, purposes, uses, sizes, quantities and any other particulars of such taking, and may grant permits, and establish the fees therefor . . .\u201d (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b310-6\">Therefore, the statute does not permit towns to prohibit shell-fishing authorized by the Commonwealth.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-7\">Whether aboriginal rights exist is a factual matter. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Santa Fe Pac. R.R., </em>314 U.S. 339, 345 (1941). We note parenthetically that the Attorney General\u2019s amicus brief contends that the \u201cDistrict Court did not make a factual finding that the Defendants were descendants of the original Mashpee Wampanoag Native Americans or that the Wampanoag Native Americans had exercised exclusively and continuously their aboriginal fishing rights at the places in question since time immemorial.\u201d But the judge did expressly find that the defendants had tribal status and that \u201cthe Mashpee Indians have never given up their usufruct rights to fish and have continued to exercise those rights as did their forefathers, since time immemorial.\u201d Furthermore, he ruled that Indians are not subject to shellfishing license requirements, and that the Commonwealth has traditionally acknowledged and continues to acknowledge the usufruct<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> rights of the American Indian.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-8\">The Commonwealth conceded at trial that aboriginal rights have long been recognized in the Commonwealth, and at least until 1941, such rights were explicitly acknowledged by statute. See, e.g., St. 1933, c. 329, \u00a7 50; Rev. St. (1836), c. 55, \u00a7 15. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>1941 the provision exempting native Indians from the shellfish regulations was omitted from the statute. St. 1941 c. 598, \u00a7 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">It is doubtful, however, by the omission, that the Legislature intended to modify or to revoke aboriginal rights recognized in the Commonwealth for hundreds of years. Cf. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Santa Fe Pac. R.R., supra </em>at 354 (\u201can extinguishment [of aboriginal title] cannot be lightly implied in view of the avowed solicitude of the Federal government for the welfare of its Indian wards\u201d). This is particularly so where there is subsequent executive and legislative action that indicates that such omission was never intended. See <em>Confederated Tribes of Chehalis Indian Reservation </em>v. <em>State, </em>96 F.3d 334, 340 (9th Cir. 1996) (\u201cCourts have uniformly held that treaties, statutes and executive orders must be liberally construed in favor of establishing Indian rights .... Any ambiguities in construction must be resolved in favor of the Indians.\u201d [Citations omitted]). Furthermore, as the Appeals Court correctly noted, the record in this case demonstrates \u201ca long history of recognition of the fishing rights of native Americans by the Commonwealth and a lack of showing that the Commonwealth intended to authorize the town to restrict such rights.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Maxim, </em>45 Mass. App. Ct. 49, 52 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b311-6\">From this discussion certain facts emerge:</p>\n<p id=\"b311-7\">(1) The town regulation in question specifically applies to recreational and commercial shellfishing. There is no definition of recreational shellfishing contained in the regulation and a strong argument can be made that the defendants were engaged in sustenance rather than recreational shellfishing.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-8\">(2) The regulation purports to govern the taking of shellfish by those holding permits granted under its provisions. The judge ruled that the defendants are not subject to fishing license requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-9\">(3) A long history exists in the Commonwealth protecting Indian fishing rights; that raises a serious question whether G. L. c. 130, \u00a7 52, which authorizes the enactment of local shellfish regulations, applies to or abrogates in any way the defendants\u2019 aboriginal rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-10\">We therefore conclude that, whatever may be the defendants\u2019 rights under Federal or Commonwealth treaties, and regardless whether their rights are aboriginal or usufructuary, the regulation cannot be said unambiguously to apply to the defendants. Because it is a basic principle of our criminal law that ambiguities and doubts are to be resolved in favor of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>defendant, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hrycenko, </em>417 Mass. 309, 317 (1994), the regulation cannot be applied against the defendants in these circumstances. \u201cIt is a central tenet of our constitutional law that, as a matter of due process, a criminal statute that fails to give a person of ordinary intelligence fair notice that his contemplated conduct is forbidden should be deemed void for vagueness.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kwiatkowski, </em>418 Mass. 543, 547 (1994), quoting <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>378 Mass. 822, 826 (1979). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>395 Mass. 302, 304 (1985). As these cases involve a criminal charge, \u201cambiguity concerning the ambit of criminal statutes should be resolved in favor of lenity.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Maxim, supra </em>at 50, quoting <em>Rewis </em>v. <em>United States, </em>401 U.S. 808, 812 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">Because we conclude that the defendants prevail on other grounds, we decline to address the defendants\u2019 alternative argument that they enjoy protection from the regulation under two prerevolutionary treaties. It is also unnecessary to discuss the Commonwealth\u2019s claim that the regulation may be enforced as a conservation measure.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b312-6\">The judgments are reversed, the findings are set aside, and judgments shall enter for the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b307-17\">It is unclear from the record whether the defendants\u2019 tribe is called the Wampanoag, the Mashpee, or the Mashpee Wampanoag.
