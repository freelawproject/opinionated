The dispositive issue is whether the tortfeasor\u2019s excess liability policy Unfits should be counted in determining whether the tortfeasor\u2019s vehicle was underinsured. A judge in the Superior <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>Court, on cross motions for summary judgment, ruled that the limits of the tortfeasor\u2019s excess liability policy should not be considered. We conclude that the limits of the excess liability policy should be counted, and, as a result, Safety is not obligated under the express terms of. its policy to pay underinsurance benefits. Accordingly, we vacate the second corrected judgment and order the entry of a new judgment declaring the parties\u2019 rights in keeping with our conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">The background of the case is as follows. On or about June 20, 1992, James Murphy was seriously injured while a passenger in an automobile owned and operated by his mother; Suzanne Murphy. The accident resulted from the negligent operation of a motor vehicle owned and operated by John Bisol.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-6\">The vehicle Bisol was operating was insured under a Massachusetts personal automobile insurance policy which provided optional bodily injury liability coverage limits of $100,000 per person and $300,000 per accident. Bisol was also insured under a personal excess liability policy which provided limits of $1 million in coverage. The $100,000 limit of coverage under Bisol\u2019s automobile policy was paid on behalf of Bisol for damages related to the injuries sustained by James in the accident. The parties agreed that the $100,000 policy limits of Bisol\u2019s automobile policy were not sufficient to pay James\u2019s total damages. The coverage limit of $1 million under Bisol\u2019s personal excess liability policy was also paid on his behalf to reimburse James\u2019s damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-7\">Safety had issued a Massachusetts personal automobile insurance policy to Suzanne M. Murphy, James\u2019s mother, which was in effect at the time of the accident. Safety\u2019s policy provides underinsured motorist coverage limits of $250,000 per person, and $500,000 per accident. The Safety policy obligates it to pay damages to, or for, any household member injured while occupying the insured vehicle. James was a passenger in the insured vehicle at the time of the accident and qualified as a covered household member under Safety\u2019s policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-8\">The Safety policy reads, in pertinent part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b538-9\">\u201cSometimes an owner or operator of an auto legally responsible for an accident is underinsured. Under this Part, we will pay damages for bodily injury to people injured or killed as a result of certain accidents caused by someone who does not have enough insurance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>\u201cWe will only pay if the injured person is legally entitled to recover from the owner or operator of the underinsured auto. An auto is underinsured when the limits for automobile bodily injury liability insurance covering the owner and operator of the auto are:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-5\">\u201c1. Less than the limits shown for this Part on your Coverage Selections Page; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-6\">\u201c2. Not sufficient to pay for the damages sustained by the injured person.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b539-7\">The Safety policy also provides that Safety \u201cwill pay any unpaid damages up to the difference between the total amount collected from the automobile bodily injury liability insurance covering the owner and operator of the responsible auto and the \u2018per person\u2019 Emit shown for this Part on your Coverage Selections Page.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b539-8\">The parties could not agree on whether the Emits of Bisol\u2019s personal excess EabiEty policy should be included in deciding James\u2019s entitlement to underinsurance benefits under Safety\u2019s poEcy. The plaintiff brought this action on James\u2019s behalf in the Superior Court seeking declarations, pursuant to G. L. c. 231 A, that the Emits of Bisol\u2019s personal excess EabiEty poEcy should not be included in determining Safety\u2019s obligations and that James was entitled to underinsurance benefits under Safety\u2019s policy. Safety filed an answer and brought a third-party complaint against James\u2019s parents seeking a declaration that Bisol was not underinsured because the Emits of his automobile EabiEty insurance poEcy and his personal excess EabiEty poEcy, when added together, exceeded the Emits of EabiEty of underinsured benefits in Safety\u2019s policy.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> On cross motions for summary judgment, the judge concluded that the plaintiff\u2019s position was correct; that Bisol\u2019s vehicle was underinsured; and that James was entitled to a payment under Safety\u2019s policy of $150,000 with interest.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The judge subsequently vacated the judgment which incorporated these ratings, and he ordered the entry of a corrected judgment which made the principal declara<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>tion as to the effect of Bisol\u2019s personal excess liability policy, but left unspecified the amount of underinsurance benefits to be paid by Safety. Both Safety and the plaintiff appealed from the corrected judgment.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">1. Safety\u2019s policy is governed by the provisions of G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 113L (2), which states that underinsurance benefits are to be paid only when the \u201cbodily injury liability bond amount or policy limit [of the tortfeasor] is less than the policy limit for underinsured motor vehicle coverage.\u201d With respect to this statutory provision, and a similar Safety policy, we said the following in <em>Alguila </em>v. <em>Safety Ins. Co., </em>416 Mass. 494, 496-497 (1993):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-6\">\u201cThe Safety policy is not ambiguous. It expressly distinguishes between the tortfeasor\u2019s policy \u2018limits\u2019 and \u2018the total amount collected\u2019 from the tortfeasor\u2019s insurer. It clearly states that a tortfeasor\u2019s automobile is underinsured when (1) the liability limits of the policy covering that automobile are less than the underinsurance limits stated in Safety\u2019s policy, and (2) the tortfeasor\u2019s liability limits are insufficient to pay for the claimant\u2019s bodily injury damages. The policy explicitly provides that a determination whether a tortfeasor\u2019s automobile is underinsured requires a comparison of the claimant\u2019s and tortfeasor\u2019s limits, not of the claimant\u2019s limits and the claimant\u2019s actual recovery from the tortfeasor\u2019s insurer. The policy further states that Safety will pay a claimant the difference between the amount the claimant collects from the tortfeasor\u2019s insurer and the underinsurance limits of Safety\u2019s policy only \u2018[w]hen an auto is underinsured,\u2019 that is, when the tortfeasor\u2019s liability limits are less than the underinsurance limits, <em>and </em>the tortfeasor\u2019s liability limits are insufficient to pay for the claimant\u2019s bodily injury damages. Thus, the question of the amount actually received from the tortfeasor becomes relevant only after a determination is made that a tortfeasor\u2019s automobile is underinsured. Nothing in Safety\u2019s policy suggests that Safety will pay even when the tortfeasor\u2019s automobile is not underinsured within the policy\u2019s definition of that word, or that the question whether the tortfeasor\u2019s automobile is underin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>sured is influenced in any way by the amount of money the claimant may actually realize from the tortfeasor\u2019s insurer.\u201d (Emphasis original).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">The issue is whether the limits of the personal excess liability policy of Bisol should be included in considering whether the underinsurance benefits of Safety\u2019s policy apply. It is undisputed that the excess personal liability policy provided coverage for motor vehicle liability incurred by Bisol. It is of no significance that the excess personal liability policy furnished primary coverage in other areas and supplemental coverage in the motor vehicle liability area. Bisol purchased the personal excess liability policy to obtain comprehensive protection, and that protection became applicable to satisfy Bisol\u2019s liability for the damages caused to James by the accident. That being the case, Safety\u2019s policy, and G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 113L (2), clearly provide that underinsurance benefits are not due when the combined total of Bisol\u2019s motor vehicle liability Emits exceed the limits of Safety\u2019s underinsurance coverage. See <em>Pennsylvania Gen. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Morris, </em>599 A.2d 1042, 1043-1044 (R.I. 1991) (insured not entitled to underinsurance benefits when tortfeasor\u2019s liability coverage, including an excess policy, exceeded insured\u2019s coverage limits for underinsurance); <em>Metropolitan Prop. &amp; Liab. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Clinton, </em>553 So. 2d 1287, 1288 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 1989) (insured not entitled to underinsurance benefits when tortfeasor carried two bodily injury liability policies which together exceeded insured\u2019s coverage limits for underinsurance). Cf. <em>Hanover Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Pascar, </em>421 Mass. 442, 445-446 (1995) (when two tortfeasors responsible for injuries of insured, insured\u2019s underinsurance benefits not triggered if less than combined limits of both tortfeasors); <em>Gleed </em>v. <em>Aetna Cas. &amp; Sur. Co., </em>418 Mass. 503, 507 (1994) (when tortfeasor operates vehicle of another, insured\u2019s underinsured benefits not triggered if less than the combined limits of both tortfeasor and vehicle owner\u2019s automobile liability insurance).</p>\n<p id=\"b541-6\">In reaching this conclusion, we reject the plaintiff\u2019s argument that a personal excess liability policy cannot be construed as a bodily injury liability policy under G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 113L (2), or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>under the Safety policy.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The purpose of the statute,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and Safety\u2019s uninsured and underinsured motorist provisions, is to furnish a means by which injured parties who have less than adequate insurance available to them are made as nearly whole as possible, by taking into account the tortfeasor\u2019s bodily injury liability policy limits. See <em>Alguila </em>v. <em>Safety Ins. Co., supra </em>at 498. That personal excess insurance liability policies are not construed as carrying with them all the obligations of automobile bodily injury liability policies, see <em>Liberty Mut. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>McLaughlin, </em>412 Mass. 492, 493-494. (1992), does not mean that the benefits provided by excess insurance liability policies should not be considered in determining whether an injured party is entitled to underinsured motorist benefits under the automobile liability policy covering the injured party.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">2. The second corrected judgment is vacated. A new judgment is to enter declaring that Safety is not liable to the plaintiff for underinsurance benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b539-9\">James\u2019s parents, in lieu of filing an answer to Safety\u2019s third-party complaint, signed a stipulation agreeing to be bound by a decision on the plaintiff\u2019s complaint.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b539-10\">The judge arrived at this amount by subtracting the $100,000 paid to James by Bisol\u2019s automobile liability insurer from the $250,000 per person limit of underinsurance benefits provided for by the Safety policy.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b540-7\">In view of our conclusion that Safety is not obligated to pay any underinsurance benefits, we need not decide the plaintiff\u2019s cross appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b542-7\">The Safety policy, which contains the language in the standard motor vehicle liability insurance policy established by the Commissioner of Insurance, see <em>Hanover Ins.
