L. c. 188, \u00a7 1A, when the declaration is filed.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We conclude that the debtor\u2019s attempt to create an estate of homestead is invalid under \u00a7 1A, but is valid under G. L. c. 188, \u00a7 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-13\">1. <em>Facts. </em>We summarize the agreed facts. In February, 1968, Phyllis A. Masidlover (debtor) acquired a principal place of residence as a tenant by the entirety. The debtor is sixty years old, and is totally and permanently disabled within the meaning of State and Federal law. See G. L. c. 188, \u00a7 1A; 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1382c(a)(3)(A) &amp; (C) (1994). In 1994, the Social Security Administration found the debtor to be disabled. She receives social security disability benefits. In November, 1997, the debtor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>filed a declaration of homestead protection purportedly pursuant to G. L. c. 188, \u00a7 1A, based on her disability status. At that time, however, the debtor did not file an original or certified copy of a disability award letter issued by the Social Security Administration or a letter from a licensed physician, as required under \u00a7 1A.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-5\">In December, 1997, the debtor filed a petition under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code. 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 301 (1994). In her petition, she claimed a $200,000 exemption for her residence pursuant to \u00a7 1A, and in doing so purported to exclude virtually all the equity in her home from the bankruptcy estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-6\">In the bankruptcy court proceeding, in 1998, the Chapter 7 trustee for the debtor (trustee) objected to the debtor\u2019s claim of a homestead exemption under \u00a7 1A. He argued that the exemption was invalid because the debtor had failed to file the proper documentation as proof of her disability, as required by \u00a7 1A.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-7\">The bankruptcy court judge requested certification to this court of the questions raised by the trustee\u2019s objection. Thus, pursuant to SJ.C. Rule 1:03, as appearing in 382 Mass. 700 (1981), the Federal District Court certified to this court the following two questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b71-8\">1. \u201c[Wjhether an individual\u2019s failure to file a Social Security Disability Award Letter or a letter from a licensed physician with her \u2018Declaration of Homestead,\u2019 as required by [G. L. c.] 188, \u00a7 1A, renders the Homestead invalid?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b71-9\">2. \u201c[I]f the individual\u2019s Declaration of Homestead filed under [G. L. c.] 188, \u00a7 1A is invalid, is her Declaration of Homestead valid under [G. L. c.] 188, \u00a7 1?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b71-10\">We answer both certified questions in the affirmative.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-11\">2. <em>Discussion. </em>The first issue is whether the debtor\u2019s attempt to create the estate of homestead is affected by her failure to file a social security disability award letter, or a letter from a licensed physician, with her declaration of homestead protection, as required under G. L. c. 188, \u00a7 1A.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We conclude that the debtor\u2019s homestead is invalid under \u00a7 1A. Accordingly, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>debtor is not entitled to claim a $200,000 homestead exemption. We are also asked to decide whether the debtor, having filed under \u00a7 1A, can now properly claim an exemption under G. L. c. 188, \u00a7 l.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In keeping with the broad public policy considerations underlying the homestead exemptions, we conclude that she may obtain a $100,000 exemption under \u00a7 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-5\">a. <em>General Laws c. 188, \u00a7 1A and \u00a7 1. A </em>debtor may exempt certain property from the bankruptcy estate. See 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 522 (1994). See also <em>Patriot Portfolio, LLC </em>v. <em>Weinstein, </em>164 F.3d <em>611 </em>(1st Cir. 1999). Section 522(b) enables individuals to choose between the Federal exemptions listed in \u00a7 522(d), or any available exemptions under State or local law. The Massachusetts Homestead Act, G. L. c. 188, \u00a7 1A and \u00a7 1, establishes two State exemptions. Under G. L. c. 188, \u00a7 1A, individuals sixty-two years of age or older, or those who are disabled as defined by the statute, have the right to claim $200,000 as an exemption. A person sixty-two years of age or older who seeks homestead protection must file a declaration of homestead protection, but does not have to file proof of age. G. L. c. 188, \u00a7 1A. However, if the declarant is disabled, as defined under \u00a7 1A, the declarant \u201cshall\u201d provide proof of disability by filing, along with the homestead declaration, a letter from a physician or a disability award letter from the Social Security Administration.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> General Laws c. 188, \u00a7 1, by contrast, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>provides a declarant with a homestead exemption of $100,000, without having to file any additional documentation.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-5\">Homestead laws are designed to benefit the homestead declarant and his or her family by protecting the family residence from the claims of creditors. See <em>Dwyer </em>v. <em>Cempellin, </em>424 Mass. 26, 30 (1996). Homestead laws are based on public policy that favors preservation of the family home regardless of the householder\u2019s financial condition. See <em>id. </em>at 29-30. Furthermore, homestead laws tend to prevent debtors and their families from becoming public charges. See <em>id. </em>at 30 n.7, citing. <em>Burrows </em>v. <em>Burrows, </em>886 P.2d 984, 989 (Okla. 1994). In light of the public policy and the purpose of the statutes, this court has construed the State homestead exemptions liberally in favor of debtors. See <em>Dwyer </em>v. <em>Cempellin, supra </em>at 30. This approach is in keeping with authority in other jurisdictions. See, e.g., <em>First Ala. Bank </em>v. <em>Renfro, </em>452 So. 2d 464, 468 (Ala. 1984) (homestead laws are to be construed liberally in furtherance of public policy); <em>Matter of Bly, </em>456 N.W.2d 195, 199 (Iowa 1990) (homestead statute liberally construed because State benefits by having families secure in their homes); <em>In re Martin, </em>875 P.2d 417, 422 (Okla. 1994) (homestead laws are liberally construed to protect families from \u201cimprovidence\u201d and creditors\u2019 demands).</p>\n<p id=\"b73-6\">In keeping with public policy, and in light of the precedent of liberally construing homestead laws in favor of debtors, the debtor argues that her homestead should be considered valid under \u00a7 1A even though she failed to comply with the express statutory requirements of \u00a7 1A. She draws an analogy to <em>Dwyer </em>v. <em>Cempellin, supra, </em>where, despite a defect in the homestead\u2019s recording, this court upheld the debtors\u2019 exemption under \u00a7 1. She further argues that nothing in \u00a7 1A states that a declaration of homestead protection is invalid if unaccompanied by a disability award or a physician\u2019s letter.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-7\">We are unpersuaded by the debtor\u2019s reasoning, because to permit her homestead exemption under \u00a7 1A would contradict the statute\u2019s explicit provisions. Our conclusion in <em>Dwyer </em>does not rewrite the statute, as the debtor would have us do in the present case. In <em>Dwyer, </em>the debtors\u2019 declaration of homestead protection fully complied with the express statutory requirements for acquiring a valid homestead exemption under G. L. c. 188, \u00a7 1. See <em>id. </em>at 30. General Laws c. 188, \u00a7 1A, unambiguously stipulates that proper documentation is required, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>at the time of filing, to show proof of a disability as defined by 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1382c(a)(3)(A) and (C). Our reading of \u00a7 1A comports with the general rule of statutory interpretation that holds that we are constrained to follow statutory language when it is plain and unambiguous, unless to do so would lead to an absurd result, or be contrary to the Legislature\u2019s manifest intention. See <em>White </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>428 Mass. 250, 253 (1998). See also <em>Attorney Gen. </em>v. <em>School Comm. of Essex, </em>387 Mass. 326, 336 (1982). This is not a case where following the statute\u2019s literal meaning would lead to a result contrary to legislative intent. The Legislature, by explicit language, required individuals to provide proof of their disabilities at the time of the filing, in order to qualify for a exemption under \u00a7 1A. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cook, </em>426 Mass. 174, 180-181 (1997), and cases cited (interpreting \u201cshall\u201d as mandatory). Thus, we conclude the Legislature clearly intended to distinguish in \u00a7 1A between elderly and disabled declarants. Accordingly, we hold that the debtor\u2019s estate of homestead is invalid under \u00a7 1A because she failed to file the proper documentation with her declaration of homestead protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-5\">Turning to the second question, we agree that the declaration of estate of homestead should be considered valid under \u00a7 1, even though the debtor expressly filed under \u00a7 1A. Although the debtor filed her declaration of homestead under \u00a7 1A, nothing precludes her declaration from being valid under \u00a7 1. The debtor meets the statutory requirements of \u00a7 1 because that statute does not require additional documentation for a legitimately acquired homestead. Our conclusion comports with the general presumption of construing the homestead exemption in the debtor\u2019s favor. See <em>Dwyer </em>v. <em>Cempellin, supra </em>at 29.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-6\">In sum, we answer the certified questions in the affirmative.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b70-15\">See S.J.C.
