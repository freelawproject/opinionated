L. c. 66, \u00a7 10, may withhold from public disclosure documents and other records on the basis of an implied exemption for materials covered by the work product doctrine.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We granted the parties\u2019 applications for direct appellate review. We now vacate that part of the judgment declaring that the Department of Environmental Protection \u201cwas not incorrect, as a matter of law, to assert . . . that it may withhold documents requested under G. L. c. 66, \u00a7 10, ... if they fall within the scope of the common-law work-product privilege,\u201d and affirm that part of the judgment declaring that the defendant \u201cmay withhold documents requested under G. L. c. 66, \u00a7 10 . . . if they meet the requirements of G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 7, [Twenty-sixth] <em>(d), </em>even if they were shared with the United States Environmental Protection Agency [EPA] as part of coordinated investigative or remedial efforts with that agency pertaining to environmental contamination allegedly related to the [plaintiff\u2019s] Pittsfield facility.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b819-6\">This case arises from a dispute between the plaintiff, the defendant, and various Federal agencies regarding the appropriate means of investigating and cleaning up pollution allegedly created by a manufacturing facility owned by the plaintiff in Pittsfield, and \u00e1ffecting areas in and around the Housatonic River. The parties dispute the propriety of the defendant\u2019s support for the EPA\u2019s proposal that all or part of the contaminated areas be designated as \u201cSuperfund\u201d sites.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b819-7\">During the EPA\u2019s comment period on its proposal, the plaintiff requested from the defendant pursuant to the public records statute documents allegedly relevant to the proposed designation. When the defendant responded to the plaintiff\u2019s request with a limited set of documents, the plaintiff commenced <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"800\">*800</page-number>an action in the Superior Court seeking to expedite access to the defendant\u2019s records prior to the close of the comment period, and for declaratory relief. The judge ordered the defendant to produce nonexempt documents related to the sites, and to provide an index of withheld documents. The defendant, produced approximately 230 documents and provided an index of 419 withheld documents, or portions of documents, many of which were identified as work product.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-5\">The judge then entered an order of reference to a special master directing him to ascertain whether the withheld documents fell within the scope of certain statutory exemptions to the public records act, or were privileged, as the defendant claimed.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The judge reserved the question whether, as matter of law, the defendant\u2019s claimed exemptions and privileges could properly be asserted in response to a public records request.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b820-6\">The parties then filed cross motions for summary judgment. The judge allowed the defendant\u2019s motion, concluding that because the public records statute should not be read as an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"801\">*801</page-number>implicit legislative abrogation of well-established legal doctrines, work product enjoys an implied exemption from disclosure under the statute. The judge further concluded that, in the particular circumstances of this case, where the defendant and the EPA have coordinated their investigatory and enforcement activities regarding the contaminated sites, and did so at the insistence of the plaintiff, the defendant was entitled to share documents with the EPA without waiving its right to assert that the documents were protected from disclosure under G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 7, Twenty-sixth <em>(d).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b821-5\">1. Our conclusion that materials privileged as work product pursuant to Mass. R. Civ. P. 26 (b) (3), 365 Mass. 772 (1974), are not protected from disclosure under the public records statute unless those materials fall within the scope of an express statutory exemption, is based on several considerations. General Laws c. 66, \u00a7 10, provides that \u201c[ejvery person having custody of any public record . . . shall, at reasonable times and without unreasonable delay, permit it. . . to be inspected and examined by any person.\u201d The statute is broad in scope, and, by the definition of \u201cpublic record,\u201d expressly mandates public access to \u201call\u201d records \u201cmade or received by any officer or employee of any agency ... of the commonwealth\u201d \u201cunless such [records] faff within [one or more enumerated] exemptions.\u201d G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 7, Twenty-sixth. See <em>Hull Mun. Lighting Plant </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Mun. Wholesale Elec. Co., </em>414 Mass. 609, 614 (1993) (\u201cPublic records are broadly defined and include all documentary materials made or received by an officer or employee of any corporation or public entity of the Commonwealth, unless one of [the] statutory exemptions is applicable\u201d); <em>Globe Newspaper Co. </em>v. <em>Boston Retirement Bd., </em>388 Mass. 427, 430-431 (1983) (public records broadly defined as records and documents in possession of public officials); <em>Bougas </em>v. <em>Chief of Police of Lexington, </em>371 Mass. 59, 61 (1976) (documents presumed to be public records when possessed by public entity). In keeping with its fundamental purpose to ensure public access to government documents, the statute establishes \u201ca presumption that the record sought is public,\u201d and places the burden on the custodian of the record \u201cto prove with specificity the exemption which applies.\u201d G. L. c. 66, \u00a7 10 (c). See <em>District Attorney for the Norfolk Dist. </em>v. <em>Flatley, </em>419 Mass. 507, 511 (1995). Because of the statute\u2019s presumption in favor of disclosure, we have said that the statutory exemptions must be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"802\">*802</page-number>strictly and narrowly construed. <em>Attorney Gen. </em>v. <em>Assistant Comm\u2019r of the Real Prop. Dep\u2019t of Boston, </em>380 Mass. 623, 625 (1980). See <em>Attorney Gen. </em>v. <em>Assessors of Woburn, </em>375 Mass. 430, 432 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b822-5\">The plain language of the statute manifests a legislative intent to provide broad public access to government documents subject only to limited exceptions. Generally, \u201c[w]here the language of a statute is clear and unambiguous, it is conclusive as to legislative intent.\u201d <em>Pyle </em>v. <em>School Comm. of S. Hadley, </em>423 Mass. 283, 285 (1996). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>417 Mass. 661, 664 (1994) (refusing to read into a statute an implied limitation, because \u201cexplicit language of the statute unambiguously manifests a legislative intent\u201d that no such limitation apply); <em>Bronstein </em>v. <em>Prudential Ins. Co., </em>390 Mass. 701, 704 (1984) (\u201cthe statutory language is the principal source of insight into legislative purpose\u201d). Here, the statute\u2019s clear and unambiguous language mandates disclosure of requested public records limited only by the definition of public record found in G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 7, Twenty-sixth. <em>Pyle </em>v. <em>School Comm. of S. Hadley, supra </em>at 286. \u201cWhatever may have been the common law in the absence of statute, we are unable to discover anything in the nature or purpose of the statute specially applicable to these records ... or in [the public records statute], applicable to public records generally, which justifies us in qualifying the broad and plain language of the Legislature by importing into it conditions and limitations which are not expressed and which are not necessary in order to give effect to its main purpose.\u201d <em>Direct-Mail Serv., Inc. </em>v. <em>Registrar of Motor Vehicles, </em>296 Mass. 353, 356 (1937).</p>\n<p id=\"b822-6\">Although generally we \u201cwill not engage ... in an analysis of a statute\u2019s legislative history to seek justification for a particular construction, where the statutory language at issue suggests no ambiguity of meaning,\u201d <em>Massachusetts Community College Council MTA/NEA </em>v. <em>Labor Relations Comm\u2019n, </em>402 Mass. 352, 354 (1988), an examination of the legislative history supports our interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-7\">\u201cExemption <em>(k)\u201d </em>was a proposed amendment to 1973 House Doc. No. 7178, the bill that ultimately became the Public Records Act. The amendment, proposed by the House Ways and Means Committee, 1973 House Doc. No. 7433, sought to shield from public disclosure all \u201crecords pertaining to any civil litigation in which an agency ... is involved, except in response to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"803\">*803</page-number>a subpoena, and only prior to final judicial determination or settlement of such litigation.\u201d The House considered and passed the bill with the proposed amendment, but the Senate Committee on Ways and Means recommended that exemption <em>(k) </em>be deleted, and the House bill was passed by the Senate without that amendment. Senate J. 2579. A conference committee recommended that the Senate\u2019s position be adopted, and the bill was ultimately passed without exemption <em>(k). </em>As one commentator has stated, \u201cAll efforts to obtain a litigation or express public attorney\u2019s work product exemption have ultimately been rejected.\u201d A. Celia, Administrative Law and Practice \u00a7 1182, at 582 n.2 (1986).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The express deletion of this provision confirms our conclusion that the Legislature did not intend implicitly to incorporate a work product exemption.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-5\">The defendant correctly points out that the legislative history does not explain why the Legislature rejected an express exemption for work product. Nonetheless, we do not \u201cread into the statute a provision which the Legislature did not see fit to put there, whether the omission came from inadvertence or of set purpose.\u201d <em>King </em>v. <em>Viscoloid Co., </em>219 Mass. 420, 425 (1914). See <em>Duracraft Corp. </em>v. <em>Holmes Prods. Corp., </em>427 Mass. 156, 164 (1998) (\u201cit is inappropriate for a judge to reinsert the rejected condition\u201d); <em>Dartt </em>v. <em>Browning-Ferris Indus., Inc. (Mass.), </em>427 Mass. 1, 8 (1998) (\u201cwe will not add to a statute a word that the Legislature had the option to, but chose not to, include\u201d). We agree with the observation that the Legislature \u201cclearly did not intend to exempt documents involved in litigation from the mandatory disclosure requirements of the [public records statute].\u201d A. Celia, <em>supra </em>at \u00a7 1182, at 584 n.10.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-6\">A comparison of the exemption with its Federal analogue also does not advance the defendant\u2019s position. The Federal Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552 (FOIA), on which the Public Records Act was modeled, see <em>Globe Newspaper Co. </em>v. <em>Boston Retirement Bd., supra </em>at 433 n.11, contains a provision that expressly exempts from disclosure documents <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"804\">*804</page-number>ordinarily protected by the work product rule. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(5). In particular, the exemption protects from disclosure \u201cinter-agency or intra-agency memorand[a] or letters which would not be available by law to a party other than an agency in litigation with the agency.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The exemption is interpreted by Federal courts to include materials covered by the work product doctrine. See <em>Formaldehyde Inst. </em>v. <em>Department of Health &amp; Human Servs., </em>889 F.2d 1118, 1121 (D.C. Cir. 1989), and cases cited. See also <em>NLRB </em>v. <em>Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co., </em>421 U.S. 132, 154 (1975) (\u201cCongress had the attorney\u2019s work-product privilege specifically in mind when it adopted Exemption 5\u201d); A. Celia, <em>supra </em>at \u00a7 1182, at 582 n.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-5\">The cognate Massachusetts exemption differs from the Federal exemption in key respects. General Laws c. 4, \u00a7 7, Twenty-sixth <em>(d), </em>exempts from disclosure \u201cinter-agency or intra-agency memoranda or letters relating to policy positions being developed by the agency,\u201d but not \u201creasonably completed factual studies or reports on which the development of such policy positions has been or may be based.\u201d Thus, the Legislature removed from the counterpart Federal exemption language incorporating common law discovery protections, including protection for government attorney work product.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-6\">That the Massachusetts statute does not contain an express exemption for work product similar to that included in the FOIA is significant. \u201cIf the language of a statute differs in material respects from a previously enacted analogous Federal statute which the Legislature appears to have considered, a decision to reject the legal standards embodied or implicit in the language of the Federal statute may be inferred.\u201d <em>Globe Newspaper Co. </em>v. <em>Boston Retirement Bd., supra </em>at 432-433. We conclude that the \u201cdifferences between the two statutes reflect a conscious decision by the Legislature to deviate from the standard embodied in the Federal statute concerning the disclosure of [attorney work product].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 433. See <em>Acme Laundry Co. </em>v. <em>Secretary of Envt'l Affairs, </em>410 Mass. 760, 770-771 (1991) (Legislature\u2019s removal from G. L. c. 21E, \u00a7 4, of limitation in analogous Federal statute [CERCLA] indicates intent to \u201cstructure [G. L. c. 21E] free from the limitation expressed in CERCLA\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b824-7\">The defendant contends that the public records statute must be considered in light of the common law that it superseded, and that in the absence of clear evidence to the contrary, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"805\">*805</page-number>statute should not be read to abrogate well-established legal doctrines, such as the work product rule. The defendant\u2019s argument mirrors the judge\u2019s analysis and her conclusion that, because the Legislature has never expressed an explicit intention to eliminate the common-law work product rule for government lawyers, the doctrine remains viable.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-5\">The distinction between the issue presented to the court in <em>Kerins </em>v. <em>Lima, </em>425 Mass. 108, 110 (1997), on which the judge relied, and in this case, makes the statutory construction principles discussed in the <em>Kerins </em>case inapplicable to the present analysis. The question there was whether the term \u201cparents\u201d in G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 85G, included foster parents.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The term was not defined in the statute, nor was its meaning evident in the statutory language. In concluding that the term was to be given its common-law meaning, we relied on the principle that \u201ca court will not presume that the Legislature intended ... a radical change in the common law without a clear expression of such intent.\u201d <em>Id., </em>quoting <em>Commercial Wharf E. Condominium Ass\u2019n </em>v. <em>Waterfront Parking Corp., </em>407 Mass. 123, 129 (1990), <em>S.C., </em>412 Mass. 309 (1992). Moreover, our examination of the statute\u2019s legislative history indicated that the Legislature had not contemplated including foster parents within the coverage of the statute. <em>Kerins </em>v. <em>Lima, supra </em>at 113.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-6\">In contrast, this case does not concern an ambiguity in G. L. c. 66, \u00a7 10, that invites differing interpretations, and the Legislature clearly considered, but rejected, the exemption sought by the defendant. Nor is this a case where we would apply the rule of statutory construction that a statute is not to be construed to effect a material change in the common law unless the Legislature has clearly expressed this intent. There is no ambiguity in the statute\u2019s explicit mandate that the public have access to all government documents and records except those that fall within the scope of an express statutory exemption. As we said in construing an analogous statute, the open meetings law as it applies to municipal governments, G. L. c. 39, \u00a7 23B,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> \u201cexceptions are not to be implied. Where there is an express <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"806\">*806</page-number>exception, it comprises the only limitation on the operation of the statute and no other exceptions will be implied.\u201d <em>District Attorney for the Plymouth Dist. </em>v. <em>Selectmen of Middleborough, </em>395 Mass. 629, 633 (1985), quoting 2A C. Sands, Sutherland Statutory Construction \u00a7 47.11 (4th ed. 1984).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b826-5\">We also are unpersuaded by the defendants\u2019 contention that G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 7, Twenty-sixth (a), which exempts materials \u201cspecifically or by necessary implication exempted from disclosure by statute,\u201d incorporates Mass. R. Civ. P. 26 (b) (3), 365 Mass. 722 (1974), providing for the protection of work product. Merely because the Massachusetts Rules of Civil Procedure were promulgated under statutory authority and in close cooperation with the Legislature does not bring them within the term \u201cstatute\u201d as that term is used in G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 7, Twenty-sixth (a). Cf. <em>Founding Church of Scientology of Wash., D.C., Inc. </em>v. <em>Bell, </em>603 F.2d 945, 952 (D.C. Cir. 1979) (where court said that the analogous Federal exemption \u201cis explicitly confined to material exempted from disclosure \u2018by statute,\u2019 and the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure simply do not satisfy this description\u201d). See Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 1410 (6th ed. 1990) (defining \u201cstatute\u201d to mean \u201c[a] formal written enactment of a legislative body, whether federal, state, city, or county\u201d).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b826-6\">2. The defendant also seeks to withhold certain documents on the basis of G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 7, Twenty-sixth <em>(d), </em>the \u201cpolicy deliberation\u201d exemption. The plaintiff contends that the judge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"807\">*807</page-number>erred in ruling that records requested under the public records statute may be withheld by the defendant under exemption <em>(d) </em>even if they previously have been disclosed to the EPA, where the statute defines, \u201cagency\u201d to mean agency \u201cof the commonwealth,\u201d and protects only \u201cinter-agency or intra -agency\u201d records. The purpose of exemption <em>(d) </em>is to foster independent discussions between those responsible for a governmental decision in order to secure the quality of the decision. Cf. United States vs. Allsteel, Inc., U.S. Dist. Ct., No. 87C4638 (N.D. Ill. Dec. 21, 1988) (discussing FOIA exemption 5).</p>\n<p id=\"b827-5\">We agree with the judge\u2019s determination that in the circumstances presented here, where the defendant and EPA are cooperating agencies which hold concurrent jurisdiction over this matter, the plaintiff insisted that the agencies coordinate their activities regarding the sites and has likely benefited from that coordination, and the sharing of these documents and information with the EPA was integral to the defendant\u2019s internal decision-making processes regarding the contaminated sites, the defendant is entitled to assert protection of the shared materials under exemption <em>(d). </em>Cf. <em>General Elec. Co. </em>v. <em>EPA, </em>18 F. Supp. 2d 138, 142-143 (D. Mass. 1998).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b827-6\">3.
