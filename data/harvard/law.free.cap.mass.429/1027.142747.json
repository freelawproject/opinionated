L. c. 211, \u00a7 3. The Commonwealth challenges the trial judge\u2019s imposition of a \u201cforthwith\u201d (effectively concurrent) sentence on certain assault convictions. The trial judge\u2019s sentence effectively subsumed an earlier sentence for crimes the defendant committed while out on bail pending trial on the assault charges. The Commonwealth contends that the imposition of the concurrent \u201cforthwith\u201d sentence violated G. L. c. 279, \u00a7 8B, which provides, \u201c[i]f a defendant on release [on bail or personal recognizance] commits a crime, the sentence imposed for [that] crime shall run consecutively to the earlier sentence for the crime for which he was on release.\u201d The present situation is a twist on what the Legislature apparently envisioned; here, the defendant was sentenced for the crimes he committed while out on bail before he was sentenced for the charge on which he had made bail. Recognizing this, the single justice concluded that G. L. c. 279, \u00a7 8B, did not apply to the present case, and denied the Commonwealth\u2019s petition for relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-11\">\u201cThis court will not reverse a single justice\u2019s denial of a petition brought pursuant to G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 3, unless the single justice abused his or her discretion or made a clear error of law. <em>Schipani </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>382 Mass. 685 (1980).\u201d <em>Rogan </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>415 Mass. 376, 378 (1993). There is no question of the single justice\u2019s exercise of discretion here, and she did not make a clear error of law. By its plain terms, G. L. c. 279, \u00a7 8B, applies to \u201cthe sentence imposed for ... a crime\u201d a defendant commits while on bail. In the present case, the Commonwealth challenges only the sentence the defendant received for the first crime he was charged with, the one on which he originally made bail. General Laws c. 279, \u00a7 8B, as written, does not apply to this sentence; it only applies to the sentences the defendant received for the crimes he committed after he was released on bail on the first charge. The Commonwealth is not challenging those sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-12\">The order of the single justice denying relief is hereby affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-13\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b936-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1028\">*1028</page-number><em>William M. </em>McCauley, Assistant District Attorney, for the Commonwealth.</attorneys>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
